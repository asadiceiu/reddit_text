0,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Need help with my direction.,1,i3715r,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/i3715r/need_help_with_my_direction/,2020-08-04 08:22:39,"Hey fellow solo players, bit of a xpost but looking for some advice. TLDR: I have a growing toy collection and along with a growing desire to be filled. How do I break this to my wife as she barely allows anything in her ass, let alone has any desire to spread me open. Heres where im at: Both in our early-mid thirties. Ive been with my wife for 12 years, married 5. Have a pretty vanilla and moderate to inactive sex life. We had one year of active sex, probably 4 times a week. That distanced to maybe twice a month, and over the past 5 years has been once a month at most. Continued regressing to maybe once every 2 months and really only happens as a result of me offering to do all the housework, childcare and be the giver sexually, with little to no reciprocation. Not ideal but not the point of the post. Due to the lack of sexual encounters/ exploration, I have come to discover my prostate on my own, first by adding the sex toys Ive bought her to my own solo sessions, and later buying my own prostate toys, and a ton, almost endless reading, research and experimenting based on information from this group. I have progressed substantially from a finger in the bum to enjoying the fullness of large toys. Went from a slim vibe, to a prostate plug, a 8 x 1.5 dildo (just to try it on for size) and the Njoy wand. I have enjoyed all these toys and they all have/had their place in my progression. I recently ordered the Tantus P Spot. The dimensions sounded right, but I recall reading from other posters that this thing is huge. Well I guess you dont know till you see it. And its BIG, but not crazy huge. Knowing that the P Spot is specifically designed to hit the prostate gave me some needed encouragement to get that thing inside me. With some warm up I gladly accepted the tip. A nice feeling of a gentle stretch. Then I lowered myself down almost all the way. A sober feeling of fullness washed over me. I allowed my ass to adjust, and with some light bouncing began to enjoy the feeling. Add poppers mix and I was fucking this thing like a man whore. I cant imagine anything hotter than my wife strapping that thing on, and taking me for a wild ride. I have opened up about my past play and desires (to an extent) and although receptive, I doubt she will ever engage on her own. Anything sexual that I have brought up has (often to my surpise) been well received, but then not to my surprise has been dismissed. I don't have much desire to open up and make myself more vulnerable. As I'm sure most of you can attest I don't love the feeling of vulnerability, but it is a necessary step in reaching an end goal. That being said I pretty much have to beg for pussy at home. I can do all the right things, and she'll fall asleep before we engage, whether or not we have prearranged to have some intimate time. I hate this feeling. I'm in peak physical shape while she is not even close. I would say I desire my wife now more than ever before. But she doesn't seem to have that desire or drive. My 2 questions are: A) how should I approach this? Let my wife believe whatever roll she takes is the best Ive ever had, and encourage progression through that channel of praise. Or just tell her that Ive progressed on my own due to our minimal sex life. Say this is where Im at and this is what I like? Can't say I have a ton of confidence in either of these playing out well. B) How to encourage my wife to take a more involved role in ours sex lives. \[The kind and caring side of me has been patient, understands what she likes/dislikes, has endured 4+ month dry streaks, done counselling and have remained supportive through this whole time. So the considerate part of me has been there to support. The primal and maybe (selfish?) side of me wants to say fuck me or someone else will! I get hit on while working regularly, and have had several older women (late 30's to late 50's) make a pass at me. I love the idea and the feeling of being wanted. Wish it was from my wife. (And to be clear I have never cheated on my wife. Dont really have any desire to either). Would just love to be desired for as well. To be wanted, loved and thoroughly fucked."
1,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Another to add to the collection,1,i40qyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/i40qyc/another_to_add_to_the_collection/,2020-08-05 17:14:22,"It's another of those nights where the weight of my thoughts are making me sleepless. As with most introductions on this thread and much of my own hesitation I figured why not give reddit a shot. Im 29(F) and SO 31(M) and we've been together for 8 years. Some background: Our first two years together were through long distance across a few state lines and we only saw each other 3 times within those 2 years because I was caught up in school. We had sex for the first time after his 2nd trip to see me and then not again until i finally moved up with him a year later. Now take into account that I was a virgin prior to him. Stupid me was so scared of the very vulnerability that sex brings and i also wanted to wait for someone special because I wanted it to be meaningful. Anyway, my first time having sex with him was more of a quickie that ended up interrupted. Not that big of deal I thought then because I figured I'd have all the sex I want soon when I move in with him. Once I moved in the sex was still pretty meh. We'd struggle with finding a good position or he'd so soft because he'd either get so tired, cramp up, or would lose feeling after so much friction. Still wasnt that big of a deal because I was still so new to sex and oh so in love. Well as the years went by there was less and less sex. Largest gap being 6 months, but frequency basically dwindled down to maybe every other 3 weeks. I started finding myself getting more and more rejected when I'd initiate because of x, y, z reasons. Reasons ranged between it was late in the night or he felt stinky from not having showered. Sex was still lousy and even after a few years I could count how many times we'd had great sex in one hand. I put up with the reasons and ate them up until I started noticing how down it made me feel. I began to question why our sex life was the way that it was and he said it was because he had a low sex drive. Okay...so me being a very understanding girlfriend accepted it and respected his low libido. Present time: I've found out in the last 6 months that he is addicted to porn and actually masturbates just about everyday, and sometimes multiple times a day. I found out one day after he linked his google account to our computer. His entire mobile browser history was viewable on real time through the computer. I confronted him with ""So you do have a sex drive, but not for me"" and i told him about the linked browser history. He began to cry and said that he just feels really insecure about his poor sexual performance and that he didnt know how to talk about it. And i explained to him that I want to be there for him and do whatever I can to help him feel comfortable or even explore new things together. It was a good talk and things were looking good for a hot minute. About 3 months after that I brought it up again because everything seemed to have reverted back to normal and once again caught him with his porn. At this point I told him that I was tired of having to bring this up, that I want a normal sexual relationship, that this porn addiction is a problem to our relationship, and that he needs to stop because it is the stem to all of his underperformance problems. I also told him that I just dont know how to approach him with sex anymore...i dont know how to initiate with him anymore. That im so scared of rejection. And that i dont even know how to feel when he touches me because 90% of the time it doesnt even lead to sex. Once again things were looking good for a bit...now back to sex every other 3 weeks. I havent even pushed it again...I've thought to myself that theres no way hes not masturbating and going this long without getting off, but gave him the benefit of the doubt. Confirmed it today that he still is getting himself off because his bottle of lube has been moved around multiple places in the last 2 days. I just dont know how to go about this anymore or how to better approach this. I very much love him, but this just isn't fair."
2,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,NRE advice in a new relationship,1,i6tuxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/i6tuxc/nre_advice_in_a_new_relationship/,2020-08-10 09:43:00,"What to do with all that NRE So this sub literally saved my life. Separated 2 years ago, finalized in March. Started dating last month and OMG. Couple nice dates, nice time but no strong chemistry. Good conversations and feeling better and better about my new found freedom (13 of 15 year DB survivor). Then I met her. I cannot put into words how crazy we are matching. Its as if I have known this girl my whole life. Skipped all the goo-goo and Gaa-gaa shit and got real right off the bat. Deep conversations, instant vulnerability, just really, really intense connection. 1st night was something out of this world. 1 week. I know, I know ....friends are like whoa man. NRE just relax...but I just cant help this intense feeling that I have known this girl my whole life. We finish each others sentences, feel the same feeling and can be upfront without fear of wondering how the other person is feeling. I am almost always a rational, level headed thinking person but thats all out the window. I dont know if Im looking for advice or just someone who as been here and can relate."
3,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Told him he needed therapy,1,i752dw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/i752dw/told_him_he_needed_therapy/,2020-08-10 23:43:32,"I (25F) and my husband (26M) have been together for 4.5 years, married for 6 months. A little background, he struggles with porn addiction, and we have talked about it, always says hes gong to do better, sometimes I can tell he is! In general, he still has the problem.. this has led me to not trust him very much. I used to tell him I do, but lately Ive come clean and said I dont, because hes gone back on his word of not looking at other women so much. In the beginning before I found out about his porn addiction, our sex life was GREAT. After I announced that I had found out about how much porn he watches and how hurt I was, our sex life declined for a while. He said hes had problems with vulnerability in the past, and girls have broken up with him over it. After a while it ramped back up. Over the years I have caught him watching porn/looking at other girls online, I beg him to stop, to go to therapy. I tell him its going to damage him in the long run, if it hasnt already. Ive told him its going to damage us, but I know he has to make the change for him and nobody else. He agrees to change.. and then just slips back into his secretive ways. This past year our sex life has take a HUGE dive. I have to initiate constantly, and 90% of the time I get rejected, or he acts like its a huge chore. He has sexual energy, as Ive caught him so much looking at other girls on Instagram and jacking off to them etc. It hurts me that its not energy for me. Im 15 weeks pregnant btw, not showing at all, just big boobs and big ass, I feel Ive become WAY more attractive, or at least I look more like all the girls hes googling. Ive asked if maybe hes afraid to do it because Im pregnant, and he said thats not it. Im slowly resenting him because Im never getting sex, maaaybe once every 2 weeks, if I initiate. Ive tried dressing sexier, I suggest changing positions, but he never wants to. I try to nag less, and love him even more, thinking maybe Im just being a bitch and he needs more love from me. Yesterday was the last, last straw. Ive been begging him the past couple months to go to therapy, and that I would go too, because I have things I need to work on as well. Ive told him I dont want whatever energy weve got going on to be here when the baby gets here. He says he will and that its a good idea, but never ends up going. I beg him to exercise (I ask him to exercise with me, and sometimes he does)and spend less time on his phone, maybe hes depressed is my thought. Says he will, never does. After a week of trying to initiate sex and constantly getting rejected, he tells me again that he has problems with vulnerability and that this isnt new. I told him that he needs to sign up for therapy tomorrow, otherwise our relationship will fall apart. It just will. I told him this problem isnt magically going to go away. You cant do this alone. Sex is important to me. Obviously he can get off to other women on a daily basis, so thats not the issue (did not say this to him). I told him Im tired of feeling rejected and not wanted, of feeling ugly. He just got far away and kind of pissy, rolled over and went to bed. Didnt say anything, just ok in a monotone voice. I love him SO much, and it broke my heart to even mention to him that our relationship will fall apart if he doesnt get help. My feelings towards him have been so much resentment lately, I just want to be loved. I want him to look up from his phone, to put it down for 2 hours and just be with me. I want to be together forever.. but his actions (or lack there of) are slowly eating away at my very core. I will do everything in my power before I leave him to make it work.. I just need him to try too.. is this asking too much?"
4,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,The Nature or Marriage? - a non-scientific poll,1,i78yuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/i78yuw/the_nature_or_marriage_a_nonscientific_poll/,2020-08-11 03:13:25,"Does the DB mainly happen in marriage or does this occur as frequently in other relationship arrangements? Just curious if it is the nature of marriage that puts the lights out on sex. Im the woman, by the way, and am stuck in a loveless marriage (for now). IMO married people should be able to have hot intimacy, as that arrangement allows for the greatest vulnerability with each other and enforces tremendous growth. Unfortunately it seems for many it devolves into roommates and career and kids and then one person decides that its just too much work/ uncomfortable to live life with someone AND have physical intimacy with them. Laziness? Complacency? Wanting to trade up? Such a sad story for many."

I am 24f with a low libido because of the following: - I was sexually abused as a child - intimacy is very hard for me because it requires vulnerability - grew up strict Christian so zero exploration or teenage hijinks. And being shamed for even thinking about sex - depression medication Since about 20 years old I've become increasingly frustrated with my libido. I want to plow and be plowed. The mental desire is there but I can't get my body to want it. Any other girls like this? What did you do? How can I find what I like and what turns me on?
7,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,"""Your emotional needs not being met in relationships."" How to properly set up a healthy environment to have ""the talk,"" and what to do if that doesn't work by looking into ourselves.",1,ic63hw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/ic63hw/your_emotional_needs_not_being_met_in/,2020-08-19 04:00:25," [URL The following are bullet points pulled from the video for conversation, but it is well worth the watch (or five.) &amp;#x200B; When people mention repeatedly having ""the talk,"" I imagine they went through a process similar to that in the video. They may have started off with a gentle bid for vulnerability, and eventually, with repeated rejections, ended up demanding their partner acknowledge what they are doing wrong. This creates an environment where our partners don't want to engage, because despite their ""aloof"" appearance, they are just as stressed as we are underneath the surface. This is where you get false promises (to stop the discomfort,) emotional gridlock, or stonewalling. &amp;#x200B; &gt;""Our partner is repeatedly not hearing us, because the very nature of this dynamic is they are not picking up on the request for emotional connection."" This right here is where the resentment begins. I think many end up posting here when they have reached this stage. That is when I reached out. It is incredibly painful to not have reciprocity when being vulnerable in a relationship. It activates the nervous system and makes us feel like something is wrong. I remember feeling a buzzing in my body for vast amounts of time. It sent me into a frenzy trying to resolve the problem. I still get unwanted zaps here and there or feel my heart drop. Meanwhile, my partner was retracting further into his shell because all of that emotional charge was overwhelming. &amp;#x200B; &gt;""I'm blurting out my truth."" When people post here about TELLING their partners how the lack of intimacy is affecting them (as I tried after repeated failure being subtle,) this is exactly what is happening. They finally-often with encouragement from others-explain righteously to their partner how they have failed them. We have a narrative in our head, ""If only they were more vulnerable. If only they went to therapy. If only they would acknowledge my feelings and give me what I want."" This makes the partner being ""told"" feel inadequate. &amp;#x200B; &gt;""Instead of taking care of ourselves, we usually feel compelled to focus on the other person, and to let him or her know they are lacking."" And the truth shall set you free! Now, this is not true for every poster here. In fact, I believe most people are trying to do whatever they can to help the situation. But as Alan suggests in the video, this commentary on our partner's personality rarely comes from a place of altruism. It is incredibly easy to slip into that state of mind, and punish our partners because we are unable to comfort ourselves. ""We're still manipulating the conversation to get our needs met."" &amp;#x200B; &gt;""You picked a partner who withholds vulnerable presence; who withholds emotional availability. That's who you picked!"" All of this makes the other person feel guarded instead of vulnerable. This creates shame, fear, and avoidance. Thus, the pursuer-distancer dynamic. I'm sure many people here are more aware than I was on that, but it is worth mentioning. I truly thought it was not the dynamic in my relationship as I have a long history of stifling my needs for my relationship. Eventually I fell prey and got caught up in my righteous ""blurting my truth."" It took me a while to see how I contributed. Alan's first piece of the puzzle to get out of this mess-focus on our own distress. If you panic and don't trust your partner, that is about YOU. ""This is my lack of being able to manage my own discomfort when my needs for emotional attunement are not met."" My partner often NEEDS me to tell him that I love him and will never leave him. That level of insecurity makes me feel trapped and I emotionally zone out because it is too heavy. I don't feel like I can authentically say that when it's demanded of me. Those are probably the exact feelings he had when I told him I wanted to be able to connect emotionally during sex, or when I tried to show him what I wanted from foreplay. &amp;#x200B; &gt;Do I stay or do I leave? Many of us are looping through this process much longer than we should because of our attachment injuries. ""I will stay stuck in this dynamic forever to avoid facing my inability to soothe myself."" We are not thinking that, but it is lingering constantly beneath the surface. Thus comes the fork in the road for each person willing to focus on themselves. It begins with what Alan refers to as a ""softened startup."" We ask our partner for vulnerability leading with ourselves. The hope is that we realize this BEFORE approaching our partners, as otherwise the damage is done and we have to settle the atmosphere before we can approach again safely. I imagine most here will have to start over, which is a long hard process, but doable. This has been my approach. I've been working on self-soothing for months now, and even as someone who grew up rejecting the need for human comfort it is incredibly hard. In my situation there is a disconnect that is keeping me in this state. I am stuffing down my emotional needs to keep the peace. I understand the need to look inwards instead of focusing on my partner. It is my job to decide if this is a result from the previous attempts at forced vulnerability, or if my partner is simply incapable of achieving the level of vulnerability I ""think"" I need in a relationship. Either way, it was imperative that I stop trying to get him to understand me. I stopped talking about it and I politely excused myself to do something distracting if I felt that buzzing urge to connect acting up. &amp;#x200B; &gt;The way you are asking for it is shutting the person down. At this point, the hope is that when you are able to come from a place of vulnerability your partner will respond accordingly. If they feel safe to open up to you, you might be able to get a lot more out of the conversation. It could become a ""us"" vs the problem instead of ""you're the problem."" When we ask our partners if they find us attractive, if they still love us, what we've done wrong, etc. we are subconsciously blaming them for how we feel, and this makes them feel shame, and subsequently shut down emotionally. For those this doesn't work for, the person might not have the skill to hear any feedback or be able to engage in conversation. This is where you need to have a heart-to-heart with yourself in a practical (unemotional) way. &amp;#x200B; &gt;""Is this the best choice for me at this time in my life to be in this relationship?"" There are probably a decent percentage of us in this camp. I have the ""forever relationship"" programmed into my brain. Sometimes, I wonder if I am gas-lighting myself about my emotional needs. Asking for vulnerability from someone else seems needy to me because I am afraid of providing that vulnerability myself. I feel this is part childhood attachment issues and part training from my partner over years to have weak boundaries. I've been working on reducing the stress in our environment, but I do not believe my person has the ability to be intimately available in the way I wish he was. I have no intention of trying to connect with him again on that level because of how upsetting it was to him (and me!) before. At this point, the problem is really figuring out why I feel the need to stay in a relationship with someone who is unable to be vulnerable to my needs, and doesn't have the emotional capacity to build desire in our relationship. WE need to change. I hope this helps someone understand why our partners shut down, and how we contribute to that dynamic. It may be obvious to some, but I grew up in an environment of endured suffering in silence, so I had no practical knowledge on how to express that my needs aren't being met. I'm trying to build those skills. I know it's not a solution, but it's a start. &amp;#x200B; I think this is my longest one yet."
8,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Update 4: **Unsent Letters** I have hit that point,1,ihqtii,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/ihqtii/update_4_unsent_letters_i_have_hit_that_point/,2020-08-28 04:44:21,"So wanted to throw another update out there as I have gotten a few comments on Number 3 and really a lot has transpired in the weeks that have passed. TL:DR I have come to the realization I am truly done. I cannot heal the emotional damage with her present and even so, I don't want that feeling of the past overshadowing a future with her where I constantly wonder if I am truly being heard. Like I said, a lot has transpired in the last month. We have continued to see our couples counselor with last week (week of 8/17) being our individual sessions after we had submitted the Gottman survey, and to review the responses with us individually. Our counselor is very Gottman based and we had originally started with the communications structures associated with that. We are both great communicators outside, me being a PM and Analyst, her being a Hairstylist, so that is not really the problem. For whatever reason, we have gotten into a communication standard of really that we don't talk. For me that is partially because I have always felt like I was not heard. Countless times of hearing my wife tell me ""she understood"" or ""she heard me"" and whatnot, but nothing ever changing caused that. Eventually, as my brother stated it, I found that it was easier to internalize, bite my tongue and swallow my pride on things that bothered me vs. try to talk to her and offer the vulnerability with it. That was because the experience always pointed to the fact that I wasn't being heard, best descriptor was that I was neglected, and thus I just internalized. She believes that we never had this problem until recently, when COVID hit, and her toxicity really started getting to me. That is when she felt that things were shutting down, and she stopped talking to me. But according to our survey, this has been present for many years, at least on my side. She claimed that she was blind to it, that all of this had blind sided her and that upset her. I found out that she has been rummaging through my email, an account she has access too as a ""joint"" account but never uses as she has her own .me account that she uses for everything. So she has been hunting for something there as well as looking through my browsing history. She came out in the meeting yesterday that she has been in the deleted stuff and saw a response to a comment I made on a YouTube video about her being narcissistic, and how that hurt. This lead into a whole discussion about how blindsided she felt, that apparently I had been talking to people about this for a very long time, along with hearing now that I have been unhappy for years (which I have expressed to her on multiple occasions) and that apparently ""everyone"" knew except her. That I had been talking to counselors, friends, family and online to people about this but not her. What was interesting was that at this point, I didn't have to pipe up and chime in, our counselor did. She reiterated my wife's feelings back to her but added that MY feelings were that I have never been heard. That talking to others, especially professionals, can be very beneficial in those situations because it allows us to get other perspective. And in this case, based on what I had expressed through the survey and in other sessions, I felt like I was going unheard. This did not sit well with my wife. As we went further into the discussion, we picked one particular instance that happened in the past that I wanted to touch on. Our counselor had told me last week when we did our individual with her that she wanted to start doing this. That the purpose of this was that because the TRUST in our relationship was Nil and Gottman's Four Horsemen were VERY present, to the point that the relationship was close to over, but was salvageable with work. And that was the thing, this was going to be a lot of work for US, not just individually. So this one instance went back to some months after my mom had passed in 2013, I finally got the motivation (after months of grief) to try and handle something simple, building some wooden speaker stands for our entertainment center. I was actually excited, had them already started and we went to Lowe's to get some finishing touches items (stain, molding, etc.) and I remember talking with her in the isle about this and that, and colors and is this too warm, etc. When her response came out and was ""I don't fucking care. They look like shit now, and I just don't fucking want them in there and to look like shit so whatever you think works. I don't fucking care."" When she said that, I snapped. Literally dropped everything I had in my hands and left and went to the car. Our counselor spoke about this, my feelings behind it and the dealing with my mother's death, etc. But then she asked my wife if she remembered the instance and she said ""No."" That she didn't remember anything like that, nor did she believe she would say something like that. We talked about this some more, but it absolutely floored me that she didn't remember this because it stuck out in my mind so strongly. And our counselor touched on that, the fact that I had such emotion wrapped up in that otherwise small instance. That really it could be seen that the association of the two things didn't go together really, but she understood at that time, some month after my mothers death that many things should be handled carefully and this wasn't. We touched, briefly, on another small occasion that my wife again did not recall, where I had literally said the word ""I AM NOT HAPPY"" to her about our relationship. This was not the first time that had happened, those words had come out of my mouth since my mother passed, and apparently in her world I never said them because she doesn't remember. She apologized for the one item, but then started down the path of justification of not knowing, etc. to the point that our counselor interjected and had to coach her. Tell her that while we might want to try to ""explain away"" the hurt, that all she need to say was that she ""was deeply sorry for the pain she caused me"" and just leave it at that. Explaining too much, going into detail tends to lose the power of the apology. But really, that apology was water under the bridge, it really meant nothing to me because of all the pain the instance had caused. All that hurt had been bottled up in me because of that lack of feeling like I could open up to her. I called our counselor afterwards because when I got back to my office after our session I spent a good 30 minutes crying. Like convulsion, sobbing so hard I could barely get my breath, type crying. Crying like I hadn't in YEARS. We talked about the session, the things that were said and I cried more... LOTS. Again, convulsion, can barely breath type crying to the point where I was shaking. THANK GOD for having my own office and almost NO staff here. My counselor expressed concern for the things my wife said, that she was confused at how she did not remember ANY of these instances and really had been blind to all of this for years, with her statements about being blindsided. She was concerned for me hearing the absolute anguish I was in, that the amount of pain that was JUST NOW starting to come out was so great. She asked me if I knew why I was crying, to which I responded Yes. I was crying because I had let it get this far, that it HAD gotten this far and that my wife had taken me for granted for so long. That I was crying for the loss of things and the realization that I no longer wanted to be with her. That the healing I needed to do did not include her because the empty words in the past and all those past experiences of neglect. Suffice it to say, that while I was ""close to done"" before, I was truly done now. My counselor consoled me, she said that in the last couple sessions she had seen me withdrawn more and understands why. That she is there to help counsel us on WHATEVER the path may be, separation, divorce, but that this is fixable if I give it a chance but it will be a LOT of work. I thanked her for that but the realization of the sheer amount of pain she has caused is something I feel I cannot heal with her present. Even then, I don't feel like I will ever get past the feeling of the neglect and abandonment that is associated with all this pain from her. That regardless I will always have those thoughts of whether she has truly changed, that she truly is hearing me and understanding me and I don't want that to overshadow our relationship. So with that, I will begin the process of leaving. I am starting to look at apartments, will talk with a lawyer soon about the process of legal separation and eventual divorce. While this greatly saddens me I know that this is the right step, not just for me but for both of us. Talking with my personal counselor about my wife's past and everything that has transpired (her being the child of an abusive alcoholic upbringing for part of her life and other things) that this is all part of the behavioral patterns that have been developed because of these traumas. She has buried and repressed these things to the point where she has been projecting them on me as well as taking them out on me. He said something that struck me like a brick wall, he said kids that normally grow up in these types of instances have major trust issues, to the point that many times they do not trust themselves. But they FOR SURE do not trust their ""loved ones"" and thus always keep them at bay. This brought up the feelings that I have had for a long time that my wife always kept me at arms length, never truly letting me in. And now it makes sense. This is why I have had this feeling, the aversion to sex, EVERYTHING. While I want to be there for her and help her through this, the fact of the matter is that I have lost much of myself trying to do this over the years. So I am not at the jump off point, that Y in the road where I either have to save myself or lose myself in saving her. If you read this far, thank you. I appreciate this ability to journal all of this as it does help to put it down on paper (so to speak). And the other thing that struck me was how pertinent the words of a recent song were... The song Resentment by A Day To Remember.... the literal FIRST chorus is ""A short term fix to a Long Term Problem, Can I learn to love these chains."" The answer is no, I deserve better than sacrificing myself to save someone else who has neglected their own demons."
9,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,A Husbands Final Plea to His Wife,1,hkyu51,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/hkyu51/a_husbands_final_plea_to_his_wife/,2020-07-04 16:34:49," Here it is, hope she gets it: My love, Despite our love and commitment to one another there is something thats stealing our happiness and it will soon end our marriage. I love you and want a happy marriage, but our marital health and our sexual health are inseparable. I wrote this hoping you would see how vital good sex is to our relationship and find a willingness to make it a priority and save our marriage. Sex is the gift from God that sets our relationship apart from any other relationship, its the *critical component* of our connection to one another. But we see it differently. You want to have it when you feel loved, *I only feel loved when we have it.* This is a key difference in the way we are made, and it determines how we think about sex. **Here is how God created me to view our sex.** One of my greatest desires is to satisfy *you* sexually. For me, our lovemaking is an intoxicating experience connected to my *desire for you,* not just a desire for sex. You think *all I want you for* is sex and I cant love you for who you are, but only what you can do for me. *No bigger lie has ever been told!* Its YOU I need. I think you are the most beautiful thing God ever made. I can hardly resist you. I like your body, I love your feminine curves, soft skin, and your exciting private areas. I want to delight in your beauty. Sure, I have a physical NEED for sex (Like food and water), but I have an even bigger *emotional* need for it. When we make love, its one of the only times my brain releases the hormone that gives me feelings of closeness with you. This does not mean my love for you is restricted to sex, but my chemical feelings of love and bonding with you are. It is the way God made me. It is the primary way I feel and express love *with you.* When I reach out to you for sex I am doing so to get back those feelings of closeness that I long for with ***you*** . **I want you to want me** My deepest emotional need is to feel sexually desired by you. I dont want you to just show up, but to [delight in the experience](URL When you want to make love to me, and you enjoy it, it tells me I want to be with you. I want to have fun with you. I have decided to give myself to you. You can give me Duty Sex every day but if you dont emotionally participate no intimacy is created between us and my emotional needs are never met. But when you choose (its a mental choice) to become aroused and give yourself fully and completely to me with no reservation, and fully (mind, body, spirit) engage in the act with me, its magic like no other and will give you the best version of me as a husband thats possible. I need this in my life and when you provide it for me with relative frequency, I feel that you really love me and want me. When I feel truly loved and wanted, I want to be with you more. I want to emotionally connect with you in other ways. I want to be more involved. To enjoy the rest of you, to learn your heart. God made it so that quality sex on a regular basis causes me to feel closer to you, and to have more loving thoughts and feelings towards you. It causes me to want to do things to please you and make you happy! The lack of it does just the opposite. **Why do I get so upset about it?** When my deepest emotional need is satisfied it invigorates and energizes me to action. But this emotional strength comes from a very weak place in my heart. It is from this place I lay bare my deepest vulnerability when I ask you for sex. My emotional well-being even my identity lies fragile and unprotected awaiting your response. An occasional rejection is normal, but frequent rejections and avoidances by my life partner scream I dont want YOU! I feel a sharp pain like betrayal, but much heavier and deeper. Anger and resentment will silently grow as your sexual rejections wear me down over time, destroying my self-esteem, and negatively effecting every area of my life. When such a vital part of my happiness is broken its hard to stay positive about anything. But Im not the only one who suffers A lack of sex is not normal in a healthy marriage. Do you ever ask yourself Why we dont truly have a close and intimate relationship? Why we dont we spend more time together? Why we never share in deep and meaningful conversations? Why is it you feel so little love, affection and adoration? Why you never feel cherished? You only need to ask this one question to find your answer: *How often and how fully do you give yourself sexually to me?* This is the secret to you getting what you want from our marriage. Believe it or not, *you* hold the keys to our happiness . **Will this solve all of our problems?** No, but it will make a lot of them much easier. And having sex is better than staying up all night arguing and still feeling distant in the morning. Even if you are not in the mood, God gave you the ability to adjust your mood. Like exercise, even if you dont initially want to make love, youll never be sorry that you did. God has made sex good for our bodies, good for our marriage, good for our hearts, good for our health, good for our souls, good for our kids and grandkids. He tells us in the Bible that we should be having it and that we should not cease from having it except by mutual agreement and then only for a short specific time period for a specific purpose (1 Corinthians 7:2-5). Do this Gods way and you will have a better life, a better husband, and all of us will reap His blessings. If there really were something so simple that could improve your life why wouldnt you try it? Do this your way and nothing changes because it cant then we will be no more."
10,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,We broke up.,5,hmibp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/hmibp9/we_broke_up/,2020-07-07 08:42:35,"Ive been perusing this sub for a long time because I knew I was in an increasingly dying bedroom. My boyfriend and I Had been having less and less sex- but it wasnt necessarily the frequency that concerned me. It was the complete lack of interest he seemed to have in sex and being intimate with me. I could usually coerce him into having sex week to two weeks and it was always good when we did have sex. But he was never interested in initiating and would often start to complain about his stomach or how tired he was at dinner to stave off any initiations on my part. We had been together a little over a year. I keep a journal every night and kept going back through my entries. I realized that the sex conversation had been happening since the very beginning and was not going to get better. It wasnt just the sex. It was the fact he couldnt open up to me at all emotionally or be vulnerable. I knew I couldnt ever be married to this person. Not just because I am HL and he is LL, but because I experience the world through my emotions and he never attempted to connect with me or understand or empathize at all. We were great friends but never great lovers or soul mates. Finally I called it last Saturday. Its so so painful. He still lives here and is in the process of moving out. I know we will both be better off in the long run, but some support would be nice. Right now all I want is for him to hold me and tell me thats its all been a huge mistake and hell do anything to fix whats broken... but of course that wont ever happen. I need a partner who knows who he is, is unafraid to trust his partner with his emotions. Showing your vulnerability is a sign of strength. Someone who can see you at your weakest and still love you and still want to make love to you, with you. Itll be a tough journey but I know I will find someone who wants me the same way I want them."
11,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Hes moving out next week,1,ho1spn,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/ho1spn/hes_moving_out_next_week/,2020-07-09 21:56:47,"My ex-fianc (LLM 32) is moving out of my (HLF 27) house next week. My emotions are all over the place, but I know in my heart and soul this was the right decision. We were together for 4.5 years, engaged for the last 7 months. The first few years of our relationship was pretty much a drunken blur (and we were all over each other, but mostly while we were drunk). Looking back, I think I realized I was in a DB before I knew what it really was. Early on in the relationship, I noticed he would ONLY want to have sex while he was drunk, and Id bring it up, only for him to deny that was the case, and that he swore he was still attracted to me. I sustained off of drunken sex for about three and a half years. We both stopped drinking about a year ago and our sex life pretty much came to a screeching halt. I think the last time he initiated was before we got engaged. We didnt even have sex the night he proposed. When I would initiate, he would turn me down 90% of the time, and the few times we actually did it were really disappointing. Never lasted more than a minute, always felt very transactional, no passion, even the kissing was very closed off and detached. I would wish so badly that he would kiss me with tongue, but I could tell that it made him uncomfortable, so I wouldnt push it. He tried to convince my that this was normal for couples who have been together as long as we have. He told me that our relationship was much more than sex and that it wasnt that important to him. I tried to convince myself that I felt the same way for a long time. We were always affectionate with each other, hugging, simple kisses, massaging sore areas (he loves to have his hands rubbed which I used to do with gusto, but the last year has felt like a chore) so I tried to make myself think that that was enough, and that we were too evolved to have a sexual relationship. After all, its shallow to care about sex, right?? It wasnt until we had set a wedding date that I started to feel really uneasy. I had this gnawing feeling that something was wrong, that this WASNT normal, and that I shouldnt move forward without trying to fix this. I joined this sub a few months ago and after reading so many stories like mine, I realized something had to change. Finally, one morning, after he turned me down yet again, I got really upset and told him that I cant marry into this. There was no passion in our relationship, and even though we love each other and are each others best friend, that I could not commit to a lifetime of not having this deeply important connection with my partner. He was completely blindsided by this, which, after reading a few posts here, usually seems to be the case with LL partners even after MULTIPLE conversations about the problem. He told me that he didnt think it was possible for a couple to have both the ability to get along with each other and the passion to want to rip each others clothes off, and that he that this would be good enough. We agreed to cancel our wedding and he promised to try to initiate more. As you can imagine, this was just another empty promise. I eventually approached him about going to couples therapy which, again, totally caught him by surprise, as he didnt think we were doing THAT bad. At this point, his lack of awareness was such a turnoff that I questioned whether we were really going to get anywhere with this. We tried couples therapy, and I am so happy we did, because it was through it we figured out the true dynamic of our relationship. We were best friends that were trying to role play as life partners. Theres so much love between us, but the sexual passion and deep emotional connection were simply not there. Our sessions often ended up centered around him and his issues, which we learned had to do with intimacy and vulnerability. It was at this point that I realized that we could never be truly happy together, and that while I do think he will learn how to finally open up and have that connection with someone, it wasnt going to be with me. This realization broke my heart, but I knew that if we really loved each other, it was time to let go. We broke up a week ago and it has been so amicable that its almost kinda weird. Now that the pressure to make this thing work is off, weve been so much more at ease around each other. Hes moving out next week. We plan to remain friends. Im so thankful we didnt let it get to the point where we resented each other beyond repair. I get so sad when I think about being in this house without him, to know that he wont be by my side when I fall asleep at night and wake up in the mornings. But then I get excited thinking about finally having a place all to myself, and to actually figure out who I really am and not have my choices influenced by someone else. And, maybe one day, Ill find the person that makes me feel the way I want them to. Im scared to death of being alone, but my curiosity for the future and trust in myself are whats making this all okay. Anyway, I just want to thank everyone who has bared their soul on this sub. Your stories have helped me realize the mistake I was about to make by marrying him. Never marry into a dead bedroom has saved me a world of trouble down the road. I offer this story up to others that may be in a similar position and may think that getting married will fix things (it wont). We all deserve to be happy and be with people that want to be with us AND inside of us (or the other way around)."
12,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,I want to thank my girlfriend for stepping out of her comfort zone.,1,hrwqeq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/hrwqeq/i_want_to_thank_my_girlfriend_for_stepping_out_of/,2020-07-16 07:39:42,"I've posted on various db subs, but I want to put this post here because I think it has value here. Summary: medical db for almost 2 years. She (LL) had cancer, recovered physically, but didn't recover mentally. She has been using distractions to not think about it. We've been in couple's counseling for a little while, and it's a good place to confront trauma. On my end (HL), I have individual counseling for childhood abuse &amp; neglect. I have been, well, tormented with triggers of neglect from a db. I'm still working on changing my frame of mind, but last week felt like I was mourning the expectations of our pre-cancer relationship. It hurt, I was a dysfunctional wreck for almost a week straight, but it was ultimately a good thing. It allowed me to finally accept that I have to put those expectations to rest (which I previously thought was impossible). Sure, I'm still scared of what the future holds, but it's better than yearning for something that no longer exists. I don't have a sexual-forward girlfriend bursting with NRE. I did, and I appreciate every memory. I lost something, and it was finally time to let it go. What snapped me out of it was this woman I live with noticed that it was 3pm and I haven't left the bed. She asked me if I was taking a nap and I said no. She asked me what I had for breakfast and I said nothing. She asked me if I was okay. Usually, I would say, ""don't worry about me,"" or ""I'm fine, don't let me distract you."" I recently discovered that, while I mean well when I say that, I'm not allowing her to see my vulnerability. I don't know how, but that's the moment the light bulb came on &amp; I told her I was greiving, but somehow communicated it in a way that was without blame. She asked what she could do to help, and (with the help of a mod in a previous convo), suggested that, when she is comfortable with it, to try stuff that doesn't involve her body, but has a sex-adjacent element (I was obviously trying to say it in a way that didn't sound pressuring). She asked for clarification, and I told her I did some research of people in our situation, and things people try. Some people try reading erotica together, some will try toys, etc. I told her I have no expectations, and I would honestly feel better if we started much lighter, like a simple back massage. We brainstormed, she said she felt positive about the destination, she's just lost the pathway there (a metaphor about her lack of arousal). Basically, she has fond memories of sex, she just doesn't know how to get there. Because we're nerds, we decided we'll play a dating simulator together this weekend. That's it. I find them entertaining, she's never played one but knows they can be hilarious, and I think that helped her a lot with her nervousness. The lack of expectations is really helping her feel safe to branch out a bit. She also wanted to try giving me a massage. I felt mixed at first (because she's failed that particular promise for months), but I honestly felt safe enough to handle the rejection if it comes (because I no longer expect anything to come from it). I repteatedly let her know that there's no intent on my end, and it doesn't have to be extensive or a grand ordeal. Just a nice little back rub would make me happy. So, the stars aligned (we both finished work/school earlier than usual, neither of us was too tired or distracted, the bed had new sheets, etc), and she asked if I wanted the massage. I will admit that a part of me didn't want to go there, because of all the hurt I associated with touch after all this time. But I took a leap of faith, and said sure. She promptly stripped me naked (I REALLY didn't expect that). She gave me the most attentive &amp; in-tune massage she ever has. She massaged my back, legs, and feet. And then I discovered that my feet were erogenous zones. Oops. I tried to balance my expressions of appreciation over the restlessness I started to feel. She asked me how it was, I told her I feel like a million bucks, she started touching my inner thigh, and"

14,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Perspective of an LL,1,gyolqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/gyolqz/perspective_of_an_ll/,2020-06-08 10:45:22,"Hi, I went on this thread to try and find something from my perspective to maybe help but a majority of the posts seem to be from HL partners struggling with their LL partners. So I was hoping to get some advice, though I'm not sure how many of you are having a similar issue. So I, 20LLF have been in a nearly 2 year relationship with my 20HLM SO. Beforehand I had never really masturbated and so wasn't used to PIV sex for a little. I thought it was probably normal at first but 6 months or so down the line I realised it's probably not still normal. Went to the GP and found out I might have an inflexible hymen (one particular tight and sore spot) and the trauma from the pain is causing an additional problem called vaginismus. Then in the first year of our relationship I also gained roughly 15-20kg. After our first year anniversary I decided to try and change for the better and went to therapy for GAD, depressive episodes and self esteem issues, I hated myself, my broken vagina, my ugly body and frankly those are still sensitive topics to this day. I'm worried that the trauma from the pain, the vulnerability from being poked around by medical professionals, the therapy, everything that was going on in my life has left me with a sour taste for sex. I'd say I ""give out"" roughly once or twice a week, maybe, his ideal is 7 times a week, once a day. Now we're in lockdown sexting is infrequent (I've always disliked sexting) and my self esteem stops me from sending any pics and so it really grates on him. But here's the thing I want my libido to increase so much... I've been losing weight over quarantine and should be at my goal weight of 55kg by December, I bought a vaginal dilator set (I'm too broke uni student to afford to go to psychosexual therapy like my GP suggested) and am nearly at the largest width and I don't know what else to do I want so desperately to be able to satisfy his needs, I don't know why sex feels like a chore to me, it's not him, I love him dearly and when I am in the mood am very sexually attracted to him it's just I'm not often in the mood. It really hurts him emotionally to keep getting rejected and I'm scared if it keeps going this way we won't last. Also my depressive episodes have been coming back on a nightly basis and he has since asked me to stop telling him when I'm sad because it upsets him to see me sad so often, and I understand that consoling me during a depressive episode is a fruitless task but I've now lost my emotional support, and then he complains about dry sexting when in reality I'm depressed but just sexting him cause he wants it and doesn't want me to tell him when I'm sad anymore. It came to a head tonight and I've been crying about my stupid broken vagina, my stupid broken sex drive and just me ruining everything in our relationship... I need help!!!! Does anyone know how to increase my sex drive???"

Probably doesn't help that I deleted my post/comment history not too long ago. Quickie refresher/update and a few notes: HLF+LLM, severe ED, untreated, but as time passes it seems to go much deeper than that. No, I'm not leaving, don't waste your time suggesting it. Therapy isn't possible right now (maybe someday). We're still maintaining semi-regular sex without intercourse. The past few times have been intensely intimate - I'm not sure if that's just on account of my emotional state or there's something within him unfolding as well? Something happened (no details, sorry) within our relationship that's sort of been a breakthrough; not with regards to the sex issue but there's hints/hope that it may spill over into that area as well and maybe open him up to addressing that more seriously. Maybe. Just yesterday while discussing the above incident he mentioned as an aside he doesn't want me to think that I need to accept that our sex life is always going to be as it is. Strange, because that's exactly what I've been trying to do since our setback at the beginning of the year. I've since been mostly silent on the issue, trying to rebuild the foundation of ""no pressure"". I told him that's been on my mind and I \*have\* been trying to accept it... and that it's been \*really\* hard. There was... remorse or something on his face when I said that. I asked if I could take a few days to do some processing and writing and then maybe we can talk about it together? He was open and encouraging. So I'm now trying to prepare for that. So... I'd had the following written a few weeks ago (before the above) to post here. I'm including it here I guess for further insight. I'm still unsure of how much to share with him and how, and what to suggest moving forward. I do know I can't really guide the process myself, and positive reinforcement works best with him than anything else. \*\*\* A few months ago I kind of acquiesced myself to the probability that (despite his insistence that he does still want to work on it) he isn't ready. To let his walls down, to open himself to vulnerability, to overcome his issues and demons, to sit through the discomfort and but forth the serious and consistent effort towards having a healthier sex life with me. Through all of my patience, frustration, pleading, understanding, insight, sensibility and practicality, and gentle prompting... it's become more and more clear that he just is not ready to go there with me yet. And goddamn I don't have the words to touch upon how much this pains me. But it is not my choice to make and I can't \*make\* him ""ready"" to do so. It seems my gentle nudging feels much more like a forceful shove to him, and I'm not sure that there's much less I can do than revert to total passivity. I know, now, that I really need to just wait for him to come to me, clinging to the hope that someday that does actually happen. To be ""there"", in all senses of the word, for him when that time comes. I'm aware it's not exactly ""fair"" in a lot of ways. But this is the reality of the situation as its presented itself, so this is what I have to do. In all of my contemplation, it's remained clear and firm that I do not want to leave. I don't. I fucking love him and as much as that makes this issue, this situation, all the more painful, I'm willing to live with that as long as I can possibly stand it. If this is the cost of admission to be with him, I'm willing to suck it up and pay it. Following the acceptance that, for now, This Is The Way It Is, I've been experiencing periods of both numbness and mourning. There is a vital, inherent part of me, this intense and vibrant energy, that I have to largely supress. I can conjure it again whenever he's receptive (and he does ensure my needs are met on some level, to the best of his ability, with reasonable regularity, and those times are beautiful, earth shattering, and fulfilling even within the limitations), but it's not a switch I can just turn off/on at a whim; slowing or stopping the flow has the side effect of creating obstacles towards summoning that again. That's something I'm trying to fight; I fear the moment he comes to me, ready, finally, only to find my once natural, enthusiastic, energetic expression of love and desire and passion ravaged and snuffed out by the passages of time and continued suppression. Fuck, I'm fearful of that possibility. Mourning, also, in facing the very real possibility that I may never know, feel, experience the greatest love I could have wished for to our fullest, deepest, highest extent. Never?! The enormity of pain that idea causes me if beyond any words I know. But so is settling for a lesser version of this love in exchange for that physicality. Sure, I can get fucked. Easy. While I don't exactly fit the mainstream ideal of attractiveness, I've really had no shortage of both men and women offer if not throw themselves at me, and have been the object of a few obsessions. But I'm not fulfilled by external validation nor, again, is it simply about the physicality of the action. I can even imagine him at some point allowing me a ""side dish"", and I am absolutely terrified of the possibility of him offering that up as a misguided ""solution"" as all that would signify to me is that he doesn't appreciate, value, or cherish the most personal and intimate part of my being and the love entwined within it. Like I'm good enough to whore out but not good enough for him to want to be with. Somewhere deep down in me is the nagging knowledge that the last time I experienced intercourse was with someone I could hardly no longer stand (most likely a mutual feeling), my mind and heart elsewhere, who intentionally hurt me both physically and emotionally during the encounter. I can't recall if this specific incident was even entirely consensual. I'm not sure if this adds to the ache at all or not. I imagine not getting to experience the full embodiment of this love would probably hurt just as bad even if my last experience were a favorable one. It's just one of those things that haunts me. While I'm trying to loosen my grasp, there is that little bit of hope I'm still desperately clinging to. I know his love is genuine and that this is a product of some deep and complex issues, and not intentional avoidance. That of course doesn't go very far in easing my pain, but it does give me a level of compassion that allows me to continue throughout this. I do believe that at least to some extent he'll come around, and eventually want to overcome whatever and pursue a deeper sexual connection with me. Again, however: that's his choice when, not mine. So this leaves me here: I am doing my best to take the pressure off, again, and undo the damage done by recent attempts to guide him to me. I'm doing my best to avoid permitting distance to grow between us out of self preservation. I'm doing my best to fight off insecurity and stay present and enthusiastic during our encounters, to underline and really drive home the positives and potential of the experience, to make sex fun, to make it something he wants, worthy of overcoming barriers and making the effort necessary to deepen our connection. And I'm attempting to prepare myself for the, I think, inevitable moment when he comes to me and presents an opportunity for conversation, and how I can turn that into, maybe, some growth if not a breakthrough. What can I do or say differently to turn talk into action? What can inspire and motivate him to move forward with consistency and drive? And I'm weighing to wait it out until then (because if he comes to me, if it's his idea, then I know he's most receptive, and more likely to act), or reach out first and let him know where I am and invite him to check in with me as well."
17,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,My fiance and I are breaking up after 8 years,1,gg72uh,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/gg72uh/my_fiance_and_i_are_breaking_up_after_8_years/,2020-05-09 12:30:44,"I'm not really even sure why I'm posting here, because I think it's over, but I guess I just wanted some feedback. My fiance (29M) and I (27F) have been together for 8 years and engaged for 5. There have been periods where sex was pretty frequent and consistent, but most of the time it hasn't been that way. At the beginning of our relationship, he said he had issues around sexual anxiety. I pretty much stopped initiating overtly around that time, because I didn't want to pressure him, but I still try to touch him softly and give subtle indications from time to time. Since that time, I've brought up sex on various occassions, and he's communicated various reasons for not being in to it, including the sexual anxiety, low libido, possibility of asexuality, medication (he has bipolar), lack of self confidence. During our relationship, my libido has significantly decreased. For a few years, it was really high, but I feel like the feeling of not being desirable to him has really diminished it. I pretty much stopped masturbating all together. Despite this, I still deeply crave intimacy, and it's not about getting off - if it was that, I could talk to him about me leeping with other people, but I don't want that at all. I feel completely monogamous. It's the vulnerability, connection and feeling of closeness with HIM that I want - and that extends outside of sex. It's about feeling safe to communicate about this, and other issues, without fear that he will put up walls and withdraw from me, which is a pattern in our relationship. 2 days ago I wrote him a letter asking him to commit on working on intimacy with him. I didn't lay blame, I acknowledged we both had parts to play, and I asked us to think about seeing a couples counsellor or at least finding and reading resources on intimacy and slowly beginning to practice them. I told him that I understood if he didn't want to, or wasn't ready to heal intimacy between us. He took it really badly, and he was really angry. He brought up a couple of experiences that have effected his desire to be intimate with me. One was a time 3 years ago when we'd reunited after a year of long distance, and he had said something dirty/kinky too me during sex which I misunderstood as being 'real' as opposed to 'fantasy', given we hadn't explored that dynamic for such a long time, and I got upset about it. The details are foggy for me, because once I realised I misunderstood it was no longer important to me, but his feeling was I implied that he was being predatory (his words). I have apologised and acknowledge how he feels about it and tried to repair this on several occassions. I've never tried to diminish his feelings. Another couple of incidents happened last year - one was him making a joke about me putting on short shorts because the plumber was coming round and I told him that made me feel objectified, and he apologised and I accepted it because I knew he had no malicious intent. Around the same few days, I told him I felt objectified again as he suddenly began slapping my ass a lot but outside of that we hadn't had sex for months, and it felt like there was no other kind of intimacy happening. It kinda just felt jarring - like I wasn't sure he even wanted me as it would just be a slap in passing with no other kind of flirtation or affection.I really understand that these incidents effected his confidence and I've tried to talk to him about them, but I feel like he doesn't want to work through them and would just rather ignore them. I also feel like he is pinning our whole dead bedroom on these incidents, when in reality this has been going on a long time and he's given me so many other reasons. He also said that he didn't want to have unprotected sex as he was afraid I'd be pregnant (I'm not on hormonal contraceptives and it isn't an option for me). I said I would be happy to use condoms and he said he doesn't want to. We've had great sex before - we've had periods of real comfortability together. We shared kinks (BDSM) and I felt so honest and open about my sexuality with him. For the last 5 years or so, the sex we have had has been pretty vanilla. We had a threesome years ago. I know he watches porn (BDSM) and I have trouble reconciling that he is able to watch hardcore content with the idea that he is low libido. I don't know how often it is, but it definitely happens and it makes me feel really rejected and undesirable. The point of the letter was to try and heal this stuff with him, slowly. I don't expect to have sex tomorrow, or next week, or even for it to be regular for a long time, but I was committed to working towards a place where we both feel comfortable with each other. Ultimately, he told me he was content with the level of contact and intimacy we currently have, and when I reiterated that I wasn't and needed to heal this with him to be happy in the relationship, he said we should look at ending the relationship. I feel completely shattered. I love him, he's my best friend and I thought we were gonna get married. It feels like he's afraid to face his emotions, and he'd rather let go of us than confront them. Maybe I should take it at face value and accept he doesn't want more, but he's said otherwise in the past - he's said he wants to have a sexual relationship and that sex is important in a relationship. That's why I have trouble believing he really is content - I think he has is own layers of issues around sex to confront, and I also think that is a symptom of a broader lack of vulnerability and non-sexual intimacy between us. Anyway, I don't want to force him and I don't want to feel unhappy anymore, so I'm going to have to reluctantly let go of us. Thanks for listening."

A love story.",1,gmf1sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/gmf1sg/the_day_before_yesterday_was_my_4th_cake_day_the/,2020-05-19 11:36:47,"Hi everybody, It's been a while! I don't know if anyone in here will remember me, but I'm sure many will remember the person who is the other half of this story. This is a story of hope, and of strength and of love. Four years ago on May 16th, I found this sub after searching ""sexless marriage"" on Google. I'd never been on Reddit before. I found this group and it was like being struck by lightning.""OH MY GOD, there are other people like me!!!"" I was a woman (HLF) at the end of a dead, broken marriage. I didn't know how I was getting out, but I knew I was getting out eventually. I had already decided that I was done measuring my self worth by how my husband of 20 years felt about me. I had done that too long. [I poured my heart out in this post](URL I received many amazing responses and fell in love with the sub. I also received a few shitty ones, which I later grew to understand was very much to be expected. But among those posts, one person stood out. One person whose words resonated with me like nothing I'd ever experienced in my life. I'm sorry /u/simianSupervisor , this story also involves a little bit of breaking the rules. I'm willing to accept my punishment ;) The person who took my breath away was /u/Toodark2Read We had so ridiculously many things in common. We began messaging that night and haven't gone a single day without communicating in some way since. I don't think I would ever have believed in the possibility of two such perfectly matched, imperfect people and the odds of us finding each other on this planet, let alone the hurdles to follow. I'm Canadian, and my Toodark is American. 1600 miles of distance was hurdle number one. We shouldn't have even made it past that one point, but we did. Then there were the two dead, but still very legal marriages to end. Mine to a distant non-communicator, and his to a textbook Covert Narcissist. On top of that there are 5 kids between us. 3 months in, I bit the bullet and made the trip to meet this man who I was already in love with. I should have had ALL the fear in the world...but I didn't. It should have ended in ""that wasn't what I was expecting"", and a trip home hanging my head in shame. But it didn't. It/he/we were everything I never dared imagine and far beyond. The passion was overwhelming and EVERYTHING, just, worked. We both felt so safe and never more ourselves. That trip was a catalyst. I went home and began to change my life in earnest. First my divorce, then his. Those two things were completed in about two years. We visited in between. Finally in the summer of 2018 I brought my youngest down here with me and at 10,300 ft, looking out over the city at dusk, he got down on one knee and asked my then 7 year old if it was OK if he asked me to marry him. She said yes, I said yes, we all cried. It was beautiful. From there we began the immigration process. My Love came to get us at the beginning of July, and we gave new meaning to Independence Day mid roadtrip in Moab, Utah. It was magic. We were married at the beginning of August and my daughter and I received our Green Cards in January. My beautiful Toodark and I get to be quarantined together and we never take that for granted. Our family is together. We have peace. We have emotional safety. We have openness. We have love, communication, vulnerability, and fiery passion. We have all the sex we could ever possibly want and need. Our kids finally get to see what a healthy, alive marriage full of mutual adoration and respect looks like. Some of you will think ""good for you, you're getting laid"" Some of you will roll your eyes and scroll past this way too long post (I totally understand!) Some of you might tell us to take a flying leap. But if ONE person were to hear our story and decide that taking the leap is better than staying stuck, angry and hopeless, then I'm glad I posted. I know so deeply what it is to live that life. Please, you do NOT have to stay where you are. YOU have the power to change your future."
19,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Out of Love,1,gskv77,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/gskv77/out_of_love/,2020-05-29 13:11:45,"Throwaway account - I'm the 34HLM and my wife is the 30LLF I think most of what I would say here would be nothing new for you r/deadbedrooms. I've recently started a new Word document and whenever I was in a mood, I would write there instead of here. I've often thought about posting and I'm unsure of what sort of advice would work. I found it somewhat therapeutic and I would sort of take it out on the Word document. I'd read it the next day after I slept off my frustration and sometimes it'd seem harsh yet honest. I kept polishing this document over and over again. We were what you imagine for new couples when we first got together ten years ago. Sex twice a day, twice a week, twice a month, twice a year.. I think 2020 is going to be the year we abstain completely. This just absolutely crushes me in so many ways. We had two long stints in a row, 6 and 10 months each where I became well-read on the topic of sexless marriages and this subreddit. I never was able to put it into the right words until I read that book by Brene Brown 'Daring Greatly.' I picked it up after watching her Ted Talk on her book and she delved into vulnerability and shame and how we humans sort of deal with it. She went into intimate topics on vulnerability and 'initiating sex' was one that had me sort of sit up in my chair at work. My wife and I have an otherwise perfect marriage. House in the suburbs, two dogs; both of us have careers instead of kids. We are financially melded together with joint accounts and loans. One of my friend's friends called us DINK's (Double Income, No Kids) so I guess that's what we are. Dinks! We aren't so much a codependent thing but we do really well with our combined resources. About this time last year, I finally had the difficult conversation with her one beautiful afternoon when she decided at the last minute that she'd rather not go out with me and stay in instead. (it was a date I had been looking forward to all week.) I told her that I needed her to listen to me and I told her that us not having sex is really affecting me. I told her I felt like we stopped being lovers. That I have a roommate with a territorial marriage certificate. (we got married in the USVI). I said what I needed to say as I given it a lot of thought and I didn't really stick around for her reply - I took off and went for a drive for a while. The next day, she sort of unpacked what I had to say and admitted that she just didn't like sex anymore. It does nothing for her. She gave me the lame, ""it's not you, it's me"" thing. What does that mean for us then? If she doesn't like sex anymore, does that mean I don't like sex anymore too? We've never had a problem with communication, but this has not gotten better in the last year. We had sex on New Year's Eve and that was the last time. Whenever I try to talk to her about it - she is quickly annoyed and we end up arguing about it or rather like talking in circles.. The other day we had a discussion about it and the next day she finally offered it up but it's become like a pity or something about it just seemed so disingenuous. I turned it down so now it's my fault or like this is somehow me getting back at her. I'm just at a loss and so frustrated. The other night I couldn't sleep I was so frustrated (horny I guess? lol) and she rolled over and sort of snuggled up to me. I just left the bed and slept on the couch and thought hard about what is going on. I know that sex doesn't equal love as we have a wonderful life together and a beautiful home and everything. I literally have it all. However, this has gone so long now that I think I am out of love with my wife. You know what sex is to me? Comfort. Affectionate. Vulnerability. Love. My love language falls on deaf ears. Talks have failed. My New Year's resolution was to quit being the one initiating all the time and my birthday, her birthday, valentines day all came and went without a word. I often fantasize about being with someone else and anywhere else. Sorry this last part I just never know how to write it well. I feel unloved, shallow, ugly, unwanted/undesired, not worthy or good enough, abandoned, rejected, depressed, frustrated. I have this deal with myself if we can make it to 2021 without sex, I'm out. I wish this quarantine/coronavirus stuff wasn't a thing because whenever I start these tiffs with her there is nowhere for me to distance myself from her. I am so lonely in marriage. I'm in pain over something so stupid."
20,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Such a difference in my relationship from last May to this one!,6,gub9g1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/gub9g1/such_a_difference_in_my_relationship_from_last/,2020-06-01 11:22:41,"Im a 34HLF with a 33M. I used to think he was LL but hes more HL than I knew. Weve been together monogamously for almost 3 years and slept together on and off for the last decade. I use the Flo app to track my periods, and also got into the habit of marking my moods, any physical changes, the days we have sex, etc. Last year during May of 2019, we had sex two times. From beginning of January through mid March of 2019, we had zero sex. I would have been okay with once a week! I was so incredibly close to leaving and he knew it. I told him if he didnt get over his emotional vulnerability issues and start connecting with me in all ways on a regular basis, that I was absolutely done wasting my time. I felt like his roommate. It sucked. About last August, I got to the point where I was done walking on eggshells about it. I made it clear that I would NOT live like this and if major improvement didnt happen in the next 6 months, I was done. The only reason I stuck around at all was due to our 5 year old together. It took some time and lots of talks to realize that he was suffering from very low self esteem and also thought I didnt want him since I didnt initiate often. I felt the same way since he didnt really initiate so I had stopped bothering. It literally broke my heart once I realized he thought I didnt want him. I had tried talking to him multiple times about our sex life or lack there of, but he obviously didnt receive it correctly or I didnt give it well. Once I realized how unsure he was sexually, I started to be extremely complimentary towards his sexual ability, initiating way more, and always let him know how much I loved it and stopped thinking he must know I like it. Thats not how it works and I bruised his ego a few times without realizing it as I can be a blunt-type of person, so he needed that ego stroking to feel more comfortable I think. We started making sure to talk things through and not let resentment build and also to nurture our relationship more and stop taking each other so much for granted. Cooking and eating together with no phones or tv, weekly date nights, anytime I was near him I touched or kissed him. I tried let him know in all ways I could that I think hes the hottest thing ever created. I would talk myself out of those type of things in the past, thinking he didnt want that. Turns out he loves it. Duh. I was demanding closeness and intimacy without supplying the comfort and type of love he needed to open up fully with me. I still feel terrible about this. I was just looking at my Flo app....and we had sex 12 times during the month of May this year!! Such a difference. The issues in our relationship are not magically fixed due to the sex. Not at all, actually. But it helps us stay close and in love and it showed me that he cares enough to take me seriously and make the strides I wanted to make to have the relationship I knew we were capable of. We had to learn to open up to each other, communicate, trust, and get out of the gridlock. Im glad we did it. Sometimes its worth it to stick it out, but please know when its time to love yourself more, stop wasting your time, and walk away."

Sex became Much less frequent right after we got married. Now it is non-existant. Im Wondering if income has anything to do with it getting as bout of it has gotten currently. I'm pretty confident she no longer respects me, as i am a painting contractor who was the breadwinner in our household for the first 9 yrs. I believe even though sex was once a month or twice, it was managable for me because in spite of her short temper, verbal abuse was minimal when i was paying the mortgage. There are various events in our past that make it even harded to live in a Deadbed. Nothing married couples cant overcome if both are willing to COMMUNICATE and get therapy if needed. I have been seeing a therapist regarding this issue and her increasing obsession with her career, job, and coworkers who she now relys on for words of affirmation and really we are barely good roommates anymore. I am constantly critizized for everything i do or dont do, and so im really close to filing divorce. What started as a love-bombing Actress, whom I thought truly loved me unconditionally. Has become a house full of contempt. The worst part is she either gets upset, or calls me needy and i ""feel"" to much. This is the response ive gotten for years when I have tried to discuss ways , ideas in which we could bring spice back into the bedroom. Im a 38yr old HLM and she is 36yr old LLF. She removed intimacy from our marriage, because? Well your guess is as good as mine. She came from a small town and had many boyfriends and experiences sexually at a young age. I was homeschooled and was with 1 other women. We used to have alot of fun together before kids, and we have fun with kids now. Its just i recognize 95% of the time before we were married we had sex after we got home from drinking. She makes 6 figures at her job now, and being passive i have just put my work and carreer on the back burner to support her as she is a tyrant at work and gets promoted often. It is her idol. Whatever free time she has is spent on her phone in bed or in a locked bathroom in bathtub for hours. She said she'd see a therapist but then lied and said they called and cancelled, well mine i can still visit webex just like everyone else at this time of social distancing. I think she just keeps me around to care for the kids? Pay the small bills she cant quite afford yet? Idk any advice would help. Im a good looking 38yr old white male 6'1 and weigh 175 after completeing farrells extreme body shaping. She is prob. 5'6 and now weighs 17? . My point here is only this. Im attracted to her as i was when she was a size 0. I have NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT HER WEIGHT. But the no sex thing , im tired, busy day, headache, excuse after excuse has been going on for almost a decade. Im unhappy, ive told her this time and time again. And asked what we can do. Idk if libido is off but she wont go to the doc either and takes nothing for birthcontrol as she had her tubes tied after our second child. She has also as of late , distanced herself while at work i cant reach her all day. She says shes busy in meetings all day. Having been home and watching her work from home, that is not true. PRIORITIES. I am not one of them. I am saddened, for my kids mostly. If the other half sees no need in even trying, I have to pull together what little self-esteem i have left and leave this woman. I hate divorce but, i also cant live with someone who not only wont EVER get intimate with me, but berates myself and our children. She had a rough childhood and as an empath I have always longed for her to show some Emotional vulnerability. It's just not gonna happen I think I've finally come to that realization. Any advice would be appreciated. Ask questions? Knowing im not alone as a HLM is helpful. Thanks -Sad husband"
22,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Where did all the flowers go?,1,fw6qq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/fw6qq9/where_did_all_the_flowers_go/,2020-04-07 06:50:04," 28 years old, a history of being chronically rejected with borderline personality disorder, and presently in a dead bedroom. thats some luck, aye? as someone who intensely struggles with identity, self-esteem, and intimacy, very little of the almost 10 year long run with my current partner has anything to show for it. across the past 24 months there has been sex about 5 or 6 times total, which qualifies us as being in a sex starved relationship by objective measure. by no means do i necessarily view sex strictly as simply a physical act or cultural obligation that needs to be occasionally met, as is presented by stoics or those far removed from the true value of sex. sex in a relationship is the vehicle that carries the undercurrent of our daily heaven and earth, and there is nothing to be found in our soil. in the place of nutrients, there are thorned bushes of resentment and seeds sprouting with weeds of passive aggressiveness. there is no romance, vulnerability, and forgiveness between us. no enthrallment, no passion, no collaboration. none of the health benefits are here to show, either. i have been experiencing more extreme stress, high blood pressure, and heightened anxiety in general. this is on top of the already present difficulties of being a borderline. in my opinion, i am holding it in pretty well, considering reports that other people in my position would have left a long time ago. to constantly yearn for comfort and to be denied it breaks my heart. it makes me feel unwanted, unloved, and ashamed. it would not be untruthful or unfaithful to say that of our family portrait is that we are just roommates. roommates who arent even fucking. during a pandemic, where there is not much else to do but spend time with each other. still, tidal waves of business challenges and unmet career objectives consume our daily lives. the vortex of work is probably the only real productive coping mechanism i have access to, considering my substance abuse and reliance on pornography to self-medicate. ignoring all of this, we function very well as a team. we have the same outlook on life and on our future, and is among the very few reasons why we continue to fight for each other and hold on. this is not to mention all of the other attached dependencies that come a long with a being in a long term relationship. we have an audience. but i digress. i used to be extremely sex positive, and actively forward myself into social situations that would promote this exciting mix of physical and emotional exchanges. i was eager to thrust myself into this space, championing the desire for worldly pleasure with whoever wanted to share that opportunity with me. it turns out, physical touch and quality time are among my two top most impactful love languages. but no-one answered. for all of my wanderlust, after episodes and seasons and volumes of failed courtships, i took heed of this repeated rejection that was taking place through my entire adolescence and designed it into ideas of my own self-image. at a time i was desperately trying to form an opinion of myself, i lost my primary care giver. she was my alternate mother figure, while my biological parents remained distant and unavailable. when that went away, nobody was there for me, and i had to come up with my own hollow boned conclusions. this has been my invalidating universe, and its continues to find its way into my life today. i would come home to a cold and unresponsive home, and taught myself that whatever warmth that used to be around is gone because it was my fault. and that it was out there, somewhere, but not here. love for me, has always felt just out of reach, and i had to navigate those problems without a solid emotional support system. my parents were not physically and emotionally around to receive their sobbing child who was struggling to find acceptance. it is in many obvious and hidden ways, that i am experiencing these traumatic events all over again in my current relationship. i am unable to access the parts of me that patient, compassionate, and loving. and i need some help finding it back, so we can all can get back on track. i want to be me again. i want to smile again. i want to feel safe again. i want to act my age, and not be frozen in time anymore. history is the hardest mountain i have ever needed to learn how to climb. i was never particularly gifted in seduction. its a language that i never got to practice, and so desperately want to speak. i am uneducated, unvaried, and uncultured as a result. and thats a very ugly and alienating feeling. my chances of realising myself becomes a further unattainable goal as my sex positiveness has gone rancid and turned into sex anxiety. through sexual anorexia i have developed an aversion to the subject matter when it presents itself to me involuntarily. thinking about it can be physically hurtful. in books, television, music, social media, the mere mention or suggestion of sexual content fills me with jealously, rage, and shame. after all, it would be a selfish sin to indulge in my own needs. this is where the weed and porn come in. its gotten to the point where i have cried watching porn. this is not what i wanted. she is too hurt to entertain the possibility that i could instead relieve my primal urges elsewhere. at least, in a way that i can come home with renewed strength. but that is inappropriate to many. by thinking that instantly makes me the bad guy. you hurt people. i am not attracted to you. this is all just about you. okay so, i am just expected to wait this out. could you really expect anyone in this position to have the availability to be further patient? to have the courage to speak up and ask again? to address the core nature of rejection and its effects on both my own history and in our relationship? apparently, she has not been able to make that connection, and how negatively i have been affected by her physical and emotional silence. that hurts a lot. or give into what she needs, which i am completely incapable of providing. to be more loving while she makes me feel unloved? to be behave more like were in a positive productive relationship while not being made like i am in one? besides, i already know what the answer is going to be. and its becoming increasingly clear that i wont be able to find it here."
23,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Should I let go of this mental hangup?,1,g0vbu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/g0vbu6/should_i_let_go_of_this_mental_hangup/,2020-04-14 10:36:01,"I want yalls opinion. I have a husband and a boyfriend. I want to keep things that way. Ever since I started seeing boyfriend I cant get off without thinking about him. I started to notice that this was happening even when I was intimate with my husband (we have always had a very active and physically fulfilling sex life). I started to realize also that even before boyfriend I have always had to fantasize to get off, often of strangers or whatever, if it included husband then it was something raunchy. I also started to feel like there was an emotional connection that was kinda missing in my marriage mainly due to my husbands stoic personality and difficulty with vulnerability. So I wanted to increase our emotional intimacy as a way of improving our relationship and I decided it was not appropriate for me to allow myself to fantasize about my boyfriend or anything raunchy while having sex with husband. This is because I read somewhere that fantasies can make intimacy difficult- like if youre not present in the moment. So I repressed the things that got me off and tried for a year now to have sex with husband without allowing myself to really let my mind wander where it wants to or else feeling guilty if it did. This has not contributed in any positive way to our sex life - it has not increased emotional intimacy - it has only caused in me uncomfortable orgasms that feel awful and created like a repulsion at sex. It seeped into my relationship with boyfriend and even with my self - I couldnt get off without immense feelings of guilt and shame and repressed sexual desires. So during quarantine I said fuck if I need to get in touch with my sexuality again. I cant keep having these semi-painful awful orgasms that dont create release but just anxiety. I have been allowing my mind to wander and sure enough it gets off thinking about boyfriend. I have a choice to make. I either accept this about myself and decide to allow my mind to do this, enjoy sex with husband for carnal pleasures sake even if my mind is with boyfriend as I cum... or just not have sex with husband because it has become incredibly anxiety inducing and causes me too much emotional stress to try to suppress what I know gets me off. I do plan on talking to him about this and we have discussed going to therapy but what I want form yall here is ... Which is preferable? Allowing the deadbedroom to happen and letting shit blow up? Or accepting that this is just how my brain is wired, that its okay to have sex for my own pleasure and think about whatever I want that gets me off and continue with a fun sex life with husband? Everything else is pretty good, weve been together 12 years and have 3 kids, I dont want to separate, he doesnt either and I do think we can use some work on our emotional connection but it doesnt have to be in the bedroom as Ive realized that making me feel emotionally connected in the bedroom is just not his strength. Basically I am looking for permission to enjoy the sex as just fucking and it not needing to be some kind of super special love making just because we are married. A big factor is that we are at that companionate love stage where passionate love is just kinda gone. I think I have come to accept that viewing this as a FWB kind of deal is just the best most healthy undramatic way to proceed. And yes Im very touchy feely and loving and affectionate in general so he isnt being deprived of affection. My only hang up is this idealism that I imagine men have about their women wanting them passionately and not thinking about someone else while she gets off. But Ive tried that and havent succeeded. So its either this or deadbedroom. What would be preferable in your opinion, if those are the only options? Note that I dont think his libido is super high and dont think hed leave over a deadbedroom, I just hate the idea of him being super unsatisfied sexually. Yes we are open but he doesnt seek out others so its on me for now if hes gonna get sex. Okay, thoughts? Questions?"
24,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Significant other wants sex but rarely acts on it. Says its fine to go 6 months without sex.,4,g2gf35,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/g2gf35/significant_other_wants_sex_but_rarely_acts_on_it/,2020-04-17 00:55:59,"For context I am 27F and my SO is 32F. I have said before how sex is very important to me, and prior to being with her my past relationship I didnt have issues with the frequency of sex, just the quality of sex. We both have issues with sexuality that are hard to overcome in different ways. I was sexually abused for many years but have done an enormous amount of work around this in therapy. She was abused some as well, and she was a stripper in college to get by. She no longer does that and had a solid career, but I respect what she had to do to put herself through school. We were both raised poor and have really made something of ourselves. Her and I have amazing mind blowing sex. Probably some of the best sex Ive ever had. However, I would ideally like to have sex 1-2 times a week. She says her sex drive is lower but that she thinks about having sex with me and is horny quite a bit. But she also believes she doesnt have to act on every whim and that its mature to not act on those urges all the time. So what gives? I think being in love and having in love sex is something semi-new for her. She mentioned how the vulnerability of it is scary sometimes so maybe thats influencing her. I talked with her about our frequency of sex and how its critical to me for bonding and feeling close to her. I dont even want scheduled sex or pity sex. I just want to have sex when she IS turned on and wants to have sex. But she insists that she wants sex when she wants to act on it, not because I think its healthy for a relationship. Ive offered and asked to go to sex therapy to discuss some of these deeper issues (fear of vulnerability, how we each view sex, communicating about sex better, etc) and she didnt love the idea but said she would likely be willing to go. In the past when I dated men I would not always want to have sex as much as they would, but I also understand that sex in relationships is a compromise. Once I started having sex in these scenarios I was like okay this is nice I can enjoy this even though I wasnt crazy about it ten mins ago. So I think in my mind I expect the same for her. I want her to understand that relationships are healthy compromise. I dont want pity sex but I do want her to not be afraid to be intimate with me or hold back her feelings of lust or affection just because. Any ideas? Ive heard of people dealing with LLSOs but never someone who wants their partner and just is like I do what I want."

Just need to vent I (F36) feel like there little to no hope my husband (M39) to have a happy, heck civil or decent marriage (together for 7yrs, married 2yrs)Thoughts and/or advice We started seeing a marriage counselor, only had one session so far, and this week we will be having our own individual sessionsbut I after tonight I feel its almost rather pointless and wastes of time and money to continue therapy. Despite such reservations were still going to do itat least for this week. So if you review some of my other post youll see that things have not been super greatsince we had our twins. I know that the first year after baby, esp post multiples, is savage on a marriagebut 8 months on Im starting to believe that he just really is like this and boys have nothing to do with itSo starting this the latest incident this evening Luckily, during plague 2020 Im lucky enough to still have job that grants me a lot of flexibility (TY JESUS!!!). Unfortunately, he is not so lucky. So I asked to me to please watch the boys so I concentrate to get a few things done for workand this turned into a thing. He told me that I was being confrontational and making crazy accusations. Like bc I asked him to go sit with the boys I was saying he has not been spending time with them all, even after I told him that was mot my intentionbut it just seems like every time I speak to him he tells me Im being confrontational, creating a scene, etcmind a majority of our fights begin with me asking him to please just be in the same room the boys. RESENTMENT: I honestly think that due to his ego he holds so much resentment and hatred towards me for my profession. Hell constantly comment on what he perceives as my lack of work ethicAgain luckily my job grants a lot freedom in regards so just because he doesnt see me working at 3am or 4am after I put the boys down which means Ill sleep in that day he assume that I do nothing...its just offensive &amp; insulting especially since Ive put in a over a decade of work in my industry and been with the same company for the better part 10 yearswhile he has found it impossible to keep a job longer than 13 months at most since weve been together. I think a lot of it stems from him coming from a rather well-to-do family which afforded him opportunities that a less privileged person would not have squandered. And then he see me someone who did their fair share of partying in her younger dates (he says he always been straight-laced), was technically ward of state (but raised by grandparents), first one in my family to graduate high school, first to graduate college, and first one to not have to do menial labor to make a livingand he just cant reconcile how I coming from such a humble means can be more stable and successful than hecoming from such a good stock always finds himself such dire straits having to rely on the generosity of his parents. Maybe Im just being paranoid, idk. GASLIGHTING: He also tells his parents Im crazy/bi-polar. So previously I open up to that I was dealing with PPA (which I soon found out he told his parentssee prior posts for more info). So I decided to nip that in the bud and speak to his parents as address how the things they done/said affected me and even tho I doubt there was any malicious intent behind their actions I found it necessary to address my concerns and my PPA so they would be conscious of our future interactionsa conversation that I had to have ALONE (DH made himself not available)but now its come to my attention (via 1st therapy session) that he is using this as catalyst to portray me as crazy/bi-polar to his family. Which makes feel so betrayed to have your vulnerability weaponized is just horrible. DEAD BEDROOM: Hes just not that into me at allwe havent been intimate since the beginning of January and that seemed liked a chore for him. Its to the point where I feel like he got his kids so now theres no reason for him to have to sex with me. I know it sounds out there but a part me thinks that he got married and had kids to appease his parentsand now the boys are here Ive served my purpose for him and his family. DISRESPECT: He is always disrespecting my motherhood. If the house isnt spotless it because I want my children living in squalor. If I have to go to Target or the Grocery store it means Im running the streets because I want to get away from kidsI buy ANYTHING its Im wasting money that I should be giving himIf Im up all night with the boys and need a nap its all I do ALL DAY is sleep. If I ask him to just be in the same room with the boys beyond feedings and diaper changesits I dont want to take care of my children (mind you its usually when I need to get work stuff done). He obv knows that I suffered a miscarriage before the boys were conceived and if I ask him to watch them so I can do something he say something like IDK was had kids if you dont want to take care of themI think bc of the miscarriage that really stings. THREATS: He is always threathening me that he will leave me an make sure a never see the boys again. I just dont think he loves anymoreif he ever did at all. Ill admitted in the thick of PPA I was horrible, but after all Ive been thru with him stuck out I thought that would of afforded me some type of grace after being hospital bedrest, traumatic birth, nicu stays, &amp; all the other mind-fuckery that comes with being a FTM. But it appears I was horribly mistaken. If you made this far THANK YOUI just really needed to ventI mean I love him and I want our family to stay together but as each day passes so does my hope usGN"

I make dinner, I cleaned the house for him, I try to look presentable and give lots of physical and vocal affection. Most of the time (if there was not a rare stressful event, in which case, I get it, we can wait. Or if his insulin pump site is sore from changing it, understandable) he agrees and smiles in a way that makes it seem like he is genuinely looking forward to it, but I've learned not to get my hopes up. He just continues watching tv, potentially drinking a couple cans of seltzer or beer... we go to bed late, and it is always an issue of it ""being too late, sorry"". I've brought it up before it doesn't feel like he is making it a priority. That I don't want to be the only one making an effort, and at a certain point, it would be nice if he initiated and I initiated less because the rejection implicit and explicit was impacting my self-esteem. It's still the same. Do I need to provide him an action plan? Why doesn't he care or think about it anymore? Depression? Anxiety? He will not talk to me about emotions, everything else he is an open book. But emotions are vulnerability, weakness, and he isn't used to sharing. I don't know where to go from here."
27,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,The link between ADD/ADHD and DBs? A revelation.,1,fdrim5,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/fdrim5/the_link_between_addadhd_and_dbs_a_revelation/,2020-03-05 18:01:57,"Wondering what the consensus is about a link between ADHD and DBs. Im a LLM33 with ADHD, but never seem to have problems jerking off when its part of procrastination, and have used it it in the past to self-medicate feelings of anxiety from feeling like I cant focus on and accomplish the tasks of the day. As a symptom of my ADHD I feel like I seek immediate and constant gratification, this is a noted condition and one of the reasons why people with ADHD can focus for HOURS on something like a video game but get bored doing something like homework very quickly. A video game provides near constant feedback, similar to masturbation where I can modulate the stimuli (porn and my hand) exactly as i like it at every moment. My girlfriend of 4 years and I have struggled with DB type issues for the past two-ish years, and while there are a few factors at play, I recently had a fairly significant breakthrough coinciding with a general breakthrough about my condition. You see, Im not an unambitious person. In fact, like many people, I have a lot of big ideas and lack follow through I start projects without finishing them. Having had to deal with insufficient healthcare for the past few years Ive recently been able to receive my prescribed medication and have noticed a significant improvement in my ability to manage my priorities. After a recent fight, and I put it in quotes because really it was just an act of frustrated expression, and not a fight per se, I realized that sex is a form of communication that I have been neglecting. Now there are some other reasons which make sex trepidatious for my partner and I (relating to her struggle with mental health and birth control), but at the end of the day Im now recognizing that while I actively try to engage and validate her with multiple love languages such as complimentary words and gestures, shared burdens, gifts (my big one), sex is a non-verbal communication that sits above all of them. Personally, my drive and desire can be derailed by my anxiety about general tasks and responsibilities. Its not uncommon for ADHD individuals to seek constant stimulation in the form of TV, music, etc, and this is definitely an issue for me. I feel like i start to stress if i spend more than 10 seconds doing nothing and strive to practice mindful meditation, but its hard. I think this has contributed to a lifetime of staying up late and drinking myself to sleep. In the past year Ive really started to grasp the importance of mental reprogramming for someone like myself, and have made HUGE strides in terms of healthy habits including physical and mental fitness. What Ive been recognizing lately, is how this philosophy of self-improvement can extend to my relationship. Ive never thought of myself as an abusive or withholding partner, but I do know that I can be guarded, and I realize now that Ive been failing to communicate my desire physically and reeling when my girlfriend gets exasperated because her needs arent being met. its not like she hasnt gone above and beyond trying to communicate these desires to me. This is going long so Ill just say that while YRMV, Im recognizing that Im a kind of person who is really susceptible to habitual practice, and that it takes a strong arm to steer off course, but sometimes youre on a collision course and need to strong arm yourself into a new pattern. While we had recently tried, succeeded, and then abandoned a practice of scheduled intimacy on a semi-weekly basis, were now making an effort to be intimate in some way on a daily basis. So far weve had incredible success and yes its early, but I think that its a winning method for people like me who need to basically train themselves to fulfill their goals. After all, with all of lifes ups and downs, theres nothing more important to me than becoming the most fulfilling presence in my partners life, as she is mine. She is sexy, sincere, and scintillating, were best friends and i love her so much Im legit tearing up. For all the projects i start and drop, this is the absolute first place number one thing I need to get along the goal line. If i can give her the love, support, and satisfaction she deserves (almost) nothing else really matters. Ive got my own shit going on too, and so does she, but her shit IS my shit too and Im seeing that now. Feeding our relationship feeds me too and Im extremely gratified and enjoying our intimacy. Its just a matter of re-orienting my time and prioritizing our intimacy, and its so satisfying! I feel so much more complete when we are physically connecting, and while previously this has been a danger zone for our relationship due to a number of factors, Im shifting to the belief that hope for progress takes vulnerability. In fact Ill end it there because i think that is truly the crux."
28,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Yes! A break in the drought! Now what?,1,fh670o,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/fh670o/yes_a_break_in_the_drought_now_what/,2020-03-12 10:00:39,"My special lady (F29) and I (M42) have been together five years. The last 3 years saw a significant decline in our sex life due to her PTSD, GAD, depression, and the (many different) medications used to treat these conditions. In 2017 we had sex maybe a dozen times. In 2018 we had sex maybe 5 times. In 2019 we had sex 3 times. Before last night, we last had sex in early August, so its been... a while. While I was always honest with her about my discomfort and sadness about our lack of intimacy, about how I didnt need just sex with a body but physical closeness/vulnerability with HER I never pressured her or tried to guilt trip her. Of course I harbored deep resentment and anger that this element was missing from our lives. Like many of you, I began to question whether this was a relationship I wanted to be a part of. Still I love her and aside from the DB, we work well together in our home, she is a fantastic stepmom to my (our) two kids, and the most recent combination of meds have helped her get not one, not two, but THREE part time jobs in her field, which means she can actually leave the house and feel productive. I am so proud of her and her hard work! But up until this past few weeks we were still struggling to secure a real connection. Hard to feel connected to a romantic partner when she feels like a roommate. And, for her, hard to feel connected to a romantic partner when hes all pent up and seems to only want sex. A few weeks ago her psych recommended weaning her off of one particular med she was on. For a couple weeks shes been a little disoriented. Psych put her on Viibryd a week or so ago. From what I read its one that is supposed to have less of an effect on the libido. So, I found out that without telling me, she approached her dr asking for a med that would help her AND US bc she knew how important this aspect of our life together was. My heart melted. (Not only for me, but for her too. The first two years of our relationship were WILD sexually. She showed me things, I showed her things- no place or time was safe from our debauchery. It was so filthy. We talked last week about how each of us had provided the other with a sexual awakening ... so even though she didnt WANT sex all this time, she did miss WANTING it, if that makes sense.) So last night she had sort of a panic attack as shes between these two meds. I was there for her, supported her, etc. She more or less recovers and we have this amazing evening of pizza and Netflix and just bullshitting. Later she straddles me on the couch and asks if Im ready for bed. Well, its been a long time since shes done that so I went to brush my teeth with the quickness, but still expecting nothing- DB will make you expect very little as Im sure youre aware. We cuddled in bed, I settled in for sleep. But I smelled it. You know,you can smell that pheromone or whatever when shits about to go down. So I went in for the power kiss. And she reciprocated. And we made out for the first time in forever, and then SHIT WAS ON. It was awkward, it was clumsy, we had a few laughs, but we ended up the way we were three years ago. When we finished, she cried and I held her. (Good cry) Lots of I love yous and lots of hugs. After care matters. This morning she was in bed and I hugged her as I left for work. She wouldnt let go. She begged me to stay home and cuddle. Later she called me Daddy in a text, which she hasnt done in a long time, which sent my heart aflutter. I definitely want this trend to continue. Not for me, but for us. I felt today after the longest time that I was into her and that she was into  me, and that we had a real connection. We built an emotional bridge last night in a significant way. I dont want us to go another eight months. As an asshole Taurus/logical-minded guy, Ive always felt that relationships are inherently transactional, including the sexual aspect of a relationship. John doesnt work to maintain a satisfying sex relationship with Mary, so Mary is justified in feeling resentful or frustrated when John asks her to complete a list of chores that will make him feel comfortable in their home. Am I wrong in thinking this way? So both because Im an asshole Taurus, and because I love her dearly, I was thinking today of ways to show my... I dont know... appreciation? No, acknowledgement? Something...of the time we spent last night. What would you do? What can a HL do to maintain a mutually satisfying sexual relationship with a LL who has broken the drought? And of course I mean things they can do TOGETHER since theyre a team. Obviously Im getting her flowers tonight, and Im making her red beans and rice (her thing) and Im going to share with her how much last night meant to me. I dunno....whaddya got? Sorry for the novel!"

Im a 25F (HL) and my man, 27M (LL) cannot be bothered to have sex. We have opposite routines and work schedules. The first 10mo. Or so of the relationship were wonderful new sex. Then, some rough life shit happened and it stopped. However, life has been good again for a while (yay!) But sex still just DOES NOT HAPPEN. And for the record: I talk to him periodically- theres always a reason why he doesnt want to have sex. And when there isnt, he just tells me I always initiate it at bad times. Theres always a different excuse. Before the whole pandemic/lockdown/stay home hit, he blamed it on our opposite schedules... by the time I come home at night hes too tired and in the morning theres never time. Yeah, okay. So, Sex was a once or twice monthly occurrence. But now that were home together all day every day.... I just want to have the quality time weve been missing. But, ladies and gents, heres what I get from him at my every attempt: - Am: Im hungry, I wanna shower, gotta walk the dog. - Midday: Im watching a game, my head hurts, I wanna nap. - Evening: Im hungry/ Im too full, gotta walk the dog, I wanna watch a movie, I wanna take a shower. - PM: Im going to sleep now. Ive tried twice daily just to try and learn if theres a time that he likes the best? I dont even know what Im trying anymore. Obviously, I cant help but think: am I unattractive? Am I that bad in bed? But, reasonably speaking, I genuinely dont think neither of those are true. And to me, this is my partner. Its not just about the amazing physical good time but the emotional intimacy too. The connection, the vulnerability together. What is it like for men? Is it genuinely just physical? What is it like after being together for a while? I want to learn how to be a better partner and how our needs are different and why. Id like to at least find some common ground. Any input is appreciated, you wonderful internet strangers. TL;DR: my BF wont have sex with me and I want male input of why that could be, since he wont give me a straight answer."
31,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,My views on what a DB does.,1,fps7fo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/fps7fo/my_views_on_what_a_db_does/,2020-03-27 17:39:24,"As I sit here and write this, I watch my partner sleep, breathing peacefully as he wanders away to a land of dreams. But I lay here, exhausted, awake and quivering with a deep set hatred that makes my heart ache. You see, sex is not everything. It is not a thing at all. We label it as 'just sex', and the word brings with it a thousand images of naked bodies grinding against each other, some sordid tale of need and despair and selfishness. Sex is love, its admiration, its compassion, its vulnerability, desire, devotion...its not just sex. It is easy to say that this too shall pass, or that there is more to life than some simple carnal pleasure. However, I have found that to love someone is to share, and when you share pieces of your soul with each other, the basic, primal urge to touch and taste and drown in lust are just parts of the process. For how can you consider yourself beautiful when the person that once promised that they saw right through to your soul and loved it all, can not even bear the sight of your naked body? How do you think yourself beautiful when the only person you turn to for reassurance is the one who turns you down? It is as if the person you were once so proud of (yourself), has somehow betrayed you and changed in ways so morbid that you are now deemed unworthy of love. We all learn to love. We love our parents, our children, we love the smell of the first summer rain, the smell of a flower, the taste of candy on the tip of our tongue...our hearts are filled with love yet each kind of love is different from the other. Intimacy is what defines it. It defines romantic love. It makes it different, special, and when it goes away we are left with nothing. I write this now in hopes that someone who happens to be like my partner will read this and that maybe things will improve from someone else. When you ignore your partner's desires, when you no longer gaze at them and then devour them, when you no longer give them your minutes and hours, when you ridicule them for lusting for you and laugh at them because quite frankly you have found better, newer objects to fixate upon, you don't just not have sex, you break a person, you throw cracks that run deep through the love that once held strong between you. You take a person that loved you, who had seen you at your best and your very worst, and then you lose them. They ache, they cry, they hate themselves for the very things that you told them to love themselves for. They begin to doubt themselves and then slowly, yet suddenly, they begin to doubt you. The woman or man that once would have laid their life down for you, now sees you as a question. Every touch is a surprise and every urge to be touched is a sign of danger. We become used to being rejected, we become used to being hurt. That girl who once wore sexy outfits and did you in the backseat of your car, now feels embarrassed that her body is not good enough, and is too exhausted of begging, too scared of rejection to even try to do you at all. The man who once made love to you through the night now sleeps because he already knows that he will be rejected if he tries and he dare not feel like he is not enough again. But run. Run far away. Your excuses will soon drown you. That work that keeps you busy will one day become a real monster under your bed. The exhaustion you faked will one day be so real that you will cry. Run to that woman who promises you an adrenaline rush, run to the person who would have you while you are someone else's...not because they want you, but because they want to feel wanted and are insecure. Run to the plethora of naked images, of women with silken bodies, and men with chiseled jaws...and run and run and run till you stop one day to catch your breath and you find that the person who was running right next to you, oblivious but determined to be there for you, has now gotten lost in these scary woods and ended up on a different path. I look at my partner once again...tears in my eyes, a dull ache of desire fading away in my body, the smell of perfume still lingering around me...I look and all I feel is sadness with a drop of hatred. He told me 'I love your beautiful face' before he fell asleep and wondered over my reply, because I rolled my eyes and a laugh erupted from deep within my soul. My beautiful face? The face that he looks at and then falls asleep. The face that he has never once grabbed out of desire, the face that he never wants to show off to this world. So I will walk away today, and sleep in a different bed. I will cry but my tears will be shed on my hands, instead of on his body. I can no longer be a pillow, just a thing for his comfort so he may hold me while he sleeps and I may cry myself away."

Ive been seeing a guy for almost two months, and for about the last month weve been exclusive after having discussed it. Things have generally been pretty good: he makes concerted efforts to see me regularly (we live a bit away from each other in a city), hes charming and sweet, and despite some issues with vulnerability is often expressive/affirming and willing to talk about emotions. The biggest issue for me has been a general feeling of dissatisfaction with the degree of physical and sexual intimacy were able to have, in large part due to his erection troubles/possibly lower libido. Before we met for the first time, we chatted on Snapchat and sexted lightly. Nothing really explicit he says hes never been one to send nudes really or even sext, though I've been into it for as long as I can remember. We go on a first date and kiss at the end, and after our second time hanging out we make out on his bed while I wait for an Uber home. This, combined with the fact that I was initially extremely attracted to his appearance and personality, creates a nice amount of anticipation/sexual tension. Im into it. The third time we hang out, maybe a week after the second, he spends the night. Were making out in my room, I go down on him, but at some point hes unable to stay hard. We talk about it briefly before going to sleep, and he calls it one of his biggest insecurities. We go to bed, but have good sex in the morning. No one has issues staying hard, and we both orgasm. I dont think much of it, as I know it happens to everyone on occasion (especially tops with the pressure to perform, the conflation of manhood with always-erect phalluses, etc.) Since then, things have been pretty much exactly 50/50. Over the last month and a half or so, weve had sex successfully three times, and hes either struggled to get hard or gone soft a few minutes in on three occasions (at which point whatever we were doing stopped). One time he became soft while I was riding him and wasnt able to get hard again to continue. Another time he was on top and it happened. That particular night, I had a wet dream (the first in some time as an adult) while we slept together. A third time, this past weekwhich was a FUCKING TRIP because he ate my ass w/ a cold sore on his lip and gave me herpes then stayed home w/ me all week while I was practically bedridden w/ flu symptomswe were jerking off together in my bed (I was not down for much else for over a week) when at about ten minutes in he let out an exasperated sigh and said: I give up. By that point, I had reached the edge of orgasm twice and held it back. More recently, weve also both begun to grow less physically intimate even in contexts that dont often or always lead to sex (hand-holding, random kisses, cuddling, even eye contact). Naturally, he feels shitty about this. Hes expressed that it makes him feel like less of a man, that hes unable to do something that is strongly linked to his masculinity. Hes said he worries that this is some sort of deal-breaker for me (I havent known how to say that it might be moving forward because Im hoping things will improve). Ive comforted him a number of times and even did research into urologists that take his out-of-state insurance and made him a doctors appointment (he wasnt comfortable doing it for himself). He was happy I cared enough to do that for him, though I was thinking more for the relationship as I can see this being a bigger issue in the long term. I have a few ideas about what might be causing it, but I plan to wait until his appointment to talk more about it (its in two weeks). Hes said he touches himself maybe twice a week and that he doesnt love porn, so I dont get the sense that hes masturbating so much that hes not horny when were together, or that hes wired to need porn to cum. Hes also speculated it could be nerve damage to his penis from masturbating a certain way as a kid. I think it could be related to nicotine consumption. Hes also been cheated on a few times, which seems to have him (too) in his head about pleasing his partner. Regardless, its impacting our dynamic. Whatever the cause, Ive been increasingly dissatisfied. I think Im generally a bit hornier than he is (he jokes that he just needs to touch/kiss me and I get hard). I know sex isnt everything, but I wish wed had more by now in 1.5 months, especially because we regularly spend around 2-3 days and nights a week together. I know its likely not within his control and that its not my fault, but I cant help feeling nervous/fearful to initiate sex, rejected when it doesnt work out and I got worked up for nothing, and unhappy that we arent having more enjoyable physical intimacy especially this early in a relationshipthough I can easily rationalize the issue, its still painful for me too. When Im single, its easy for me to go months without sexual intimacy, and I often do; this feels fine then because Im able to be open to chance encounters and random opportunities for desire. In the context of a monogamous relationship, regular sex is quite important to me. I enjoy the intimacy that comes with it, and simply being able to get dick regularly and safely from someone I like and trust. A lot has happened quite early in a relationship and I think its just overwhelmed me. I feel like the anxiety around the forthcoming appointment (which he obviously shares) is making this time in between feel odd. Hell likely come over on Valentines Day and I feel like its going to be relatively romantic. The idea of sex (and the prerequisitesbeing physically close, touching each other, kissing, cuddling) sound undesirable at the moment and sometimes give me anxiety. How do I deal with my currently decreased feelings of attraction toward him in a healthy way? Is it possible that things will get better after the appointment? If they dont, should I break things off if things continue as they are now, or give it more time?"
34,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Survivor's views on a couple things,1,f4emx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/f4emx8/survivors_views_on_a_couple_things/,2020-02-16 06:51:41,"So I've been out of my toxic DB now for 6 months. Over that time period I've had a lot of time to research what kinds of things went wrong, what sort of things to avoid in the next relationship, and different misconceptions. One thing I have found, and it seems to be the biggest one out there is: All men care about is THEIR release, and they just want sex and that's it. While I will admit that there are douchebags out there who only want empty sex for their own gratification...I can assure you that the majority of men in marriages/long term relationships etc want sex for the connection it brings. &amp;#x200B; Emotions are hard for men to express...sometimes upbringing has a lot to do with it being told to man up and not cry, or just to shut up and suck it up, or media suggesting constantly that men don't share their emotions. Another problem is toxic feminazism(NOT feminism) in mags telling women that all men think with their penis. It's simple...we're afraid of our emotions because every time we expose our vulnerability, our hearts and emotions get ripped on, laughed at, stomped on, and dismissed. Sex isn't about the release to us...for myself, and countless other men it's the connection it brings. Knowing your wife/gf/husband/bf desires you in the most intimate of ways. Feeling closer than ever to your partner, being one with them. It's so much more emotional to us men than media or old school mentality would attempt to have you believe. If it was ""just sex"", would we have not gone out and gotten it from somewhere else? Exactly. We desire that connection from that one person, the one person we fully trust. Sure there are some times where its super hot and carnal...but that's mutual with your partner...sometimes it is just a quickie before work. But that also means something to us For me personally...I subscribe to the theory that a man judges his self worth by how much his wife wants to touch him(because of the emotion and connection that represents), and by how well he does with his job. Confidence is key with men...once our confidence is stripped away from us, we begin to crumble. Sometimes it's caught and you're able to regain it, but sometimes it isn't...which then leads down the road of broken marriage and divorce. One thing that tears our trust and confidence down is lack of follow through. This is another thing...we will believe you only so long before we begin to back off and protect ourselves from being hurt. We stop believing you because it hurts. We stop trusting you. Then we get yelled at for not trusting you. It sucks, feels like a no win. Then throw in some situations like my own, where I was consistently told she wasn't in the mood...yet constantly read erotica and masturbated...that hurts us almost more than anything. &amp;#x200B; My point here wasn't to piss anyone off, it wasn't to start a war of words. I wanted to give a POV on some of the things that are said about men and sex out there...Please don't be mean, or rude if you decide to reply."

Obviously there are a myriad of variables for each of the 3 choices listed above that go into deciding which of these to choose. Most of us have likely gone back and forth between fighting and some level of acceptance only to go back to fighting again. Some of us have made the brave decision to leave. I (HLM)am tired of fighting. It is emotionally draining, it is not what I want to do I just have a SO (asexual/LLF) who will not have a honest discussion. To have an honest discussion one has to be vulnerable and own their part in the dysfunction. Vulnerability is not her thing. She becomes supremely uncomfortable....to get out of it she sabotages the discussion and it turns into a fight. I know some of this is from a rough childhood (nonsexual abuse). It then leads to tension and a couple weeks of her brooding over the fight. Due to kids in the picture, my still strong feelings for her, and a host of other reasons I have chosen not to leave. I am choosing now to no longer fight. That leaves acceptance. Honestly I am struggling with this. I am not sure what this really looks like. I have had some great advice on here and am coming back for more. For those of you that have chosen the acceptance route how do you maintain the attitude or approach of accepting the situation? What are your coping mechanisms? If you fall off the acceptance wagon how do you get back on? How do you deal with your sexual desire for someone who will not / cannot return it? Any and all advice appreciated."

My (24F) bf (27M) pretty much never wants sex. Its a once a month thing, only on his terms. He doesnt care anymore about getting me off during or after, either like he used to. Like most peoples experiences in this sub, in the beginning it was magical. I thought I made myself clear in then how important sex was to me, and he agreed. But now when I mention it, he says you put way too much stock in sex. You focus on the negative. Look at all the other good aspects of our relationship. He says he wants to do better and just recently got health care and claims he will investigate a possible low T or medical issue. But if I push the subject Im griping, which doesnt help. I try not to make it about me, or internalize the rejection. Ive gained 10 or so pounds since the beginning but he swears up and down its not that. Every time I bring it up, it strengthens the stigma around it. But if I bury it, the feelings comes back with a vengeance. Im already a cynical person, and the resentment just builds. Hes said before he feels like its a confidence issue - and during arguments he says he doesnt think I like him. When really the lack of intimacy intensifies my irritation about other things and I end up making snide remarks about it, or I have little to no patience with him. We went on a vacation this weekend. No sex. What hurts the worst for some reason is that before the trip he said he would like a blowjob during the trip and then we could see the where it leads. I guess I should take that as hope. But to me it just feels like Im begging and I know I shouldnt have to. I HATE the vulnerability I feel from it. I love him so much but I know I shouldnt accept this for the long term. Leaving him doesnt feel right either whatsoever. I want to have hope but that doesnt come easy for me in general with anything. Thanks for reading."
37,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,10 years into marriage and now questioning it seriously,1,etzpq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/etzpq6/10_years_into_marriage_and_now_questioning_it/,2020-01-26 12:03:47,"Hi there After two kids around 6yrs old, my sex life has been the lowest ever, If I am lucky I would get once a month, a quick dull kind of monotonous sex. I am really not happy about that, wife blames her lack of desire (LL) on a few factors: * Quitted her long-time job suddenly to stay at home and take care of the kids. We knew later that this event caused her a serious depression. * Being a little over her comfortable body weight * Being overall exhausted at the end of the day To make matters more complicated, two years ago while she was depressed she had an affair and I found out about it. After a few visits to couples therapy, I was made aware that there wasn't any love involved in the affair and that she has never stopped loving me, it was the depression and the lack of a coping mechanism that let her to that one night sex with a common friend of us (that bastard). He took advantage of the vulnerability she had and she didn't know how to reject/what to do at that moment and gave in. At least that's my therapist's assessment. Anyway, the affair partner was cut off, she has painfully apologized and I have decided to stay hoping things will get better. I am almost 40years old (wife is 37) and I consider myself a good husband and dad, I help around the house, pay the bills, take my kids to practices, etc., and my wife and I get along well. Today sex remains the same drill, once a month and in the same dull fashion. I know that after coming from an affair it might be difficult to regain intimacy and I have been very patient, but honestly, I do really crave that sex more often. I miss that rush, I miss those 2 or 3 round sessions, I miss her giving me oral and all those fantastic activities involved in sex. The few times that I have initiated intimacy I feel rejected stating that she is not into it, she is tired, she feels fat, the kids, the duty of the day, etc. I have brought up this topic with her and have communicated my needs of being wanted intimately, but every time she says that I put pressure on her. To me, I feel like its never a good moment to talk about this. The affair event has actually made me realize to take better care of myself. In the last year, I have been eating better, I\`ve set up a steady work out routine, cut down alcohol, changed haircut, groomed better, etc. Overall I have never felt this good about my self-image ever and I think that has made me crave even more sex. I have to be honest, she is a fantastic mother to my kids, she is friendly, enjoyable to be around, I know she is loving me (she actually tells me that daily by looking into my eyes, she holds my hand, she reminds me how sorry she is to have caused this pain to me while she hugs me, etc, but still its the sex part that I am missing and I can't wait forever!!! and I am tired of masturbating me weekly :( Sometimes I think about getting a divorce but I am not really sure if that is really necessary and I don't want to make something stupid that will screw up everything, especially with my kids. Anyway, I guess I wanted to vent and if someone cares for throwing me some advice I really appreciate it. Thanks!"

It was second day of sleeping alone in my new room. I went home made some dinner, made sure he ate something and also before I go my place I take our dog out on a good walk because I still have the keys and it was my part so i had to do it. I got in the apartment and cleaned is bed . I came back to my place and cooked a good meal for me are on the common living space . No one was home so I sat and ate it. Then went back to my room to sit for a while . I cleaned up a little and just sat there. Slowly as time started passing and it became darker I could here the people around laughing and having fun. I started feeling a little empty maybe a moment of question to me. I know at this point I could read something, study a course, go for a walk. But I stated feeling the burden of emotions , vulnerability . I wanted to speak to someone , I mean talk to someone verbally you know. I picked up my phone scrolled through. Yes I have one friend in this city left so I thought to call her but I hesitated to ask her for help and there as reasons to that. I have been a Reddit use since a long time so I thought maybe use it to help talk to someone but it's an era of text messages no one likes phone call. So I had to fight theses urges , these moments of break down but then I took a shower a hot shower and went to bed , hussle in bed for a while turning sides and then went to sleep. I am still someone wife's still starved of intimacy. But please write me some words of motivation and some good suggestion as well. I will go home and read today and actually make a routine for the evening as well. I will make sure I study for 2 hrs everyday because I have classes coming up in the summer . . Just wanted to write it somewhere. Long journey and direction is very necessary."
39,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,I ended up in an affair and I deeply regret it. Never let your guard down.,1,ec0cts,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/ec0cts/i_ended_up_in_an_affair_and_i_deeply_regret_it/,2019-12-18 06:14:01,"I really need to get this off my chest. I [28F] have been with my SO [30M] for 8-10 years. He is truly the best bf that any girl can ask for and treats me like a princess everyday of my life (except in bed). We started talking about marriage and I had cold feet. I read the threads here and momentarily thought I might regret having little intimacy and sex for the rest of my life. He has promised for much better sex after marriage but I somehow could not bring myself to believe that. Im an attractive person but I felt my self esteem plunge over the years as I continue to face rejections from the person I believed loved me the most. And I still believe he does. I just could not understand why he didnt seem to desire me. In the recent years, we didnt even have much cuddling or kissing and sex was 3 times a month, about 10min each time. We do not own a house yet and he said the stress of having sex in our parents house has contributed greatly to this and I agree but could not accept. I just did not feel the desire. I think that could not have been faked? I really dont know anything anymore. I somehow ended up in a 3 weeks to 1 month affair (its over now) and I greatly regret it. After my SO found out/ I confessed, he told me that previously, he had been trying very hard to control himself as we did not have our own private space and were not married yet so we should not be having much sex. Also, he did not give me oral or finger me much as I am very into hygiene and he was worried that his mouth and fingers were not clean enough. Since that day he found out/ I confessed to him, we have been having superb sex everyday (been a month). In the past 10 years, he probably fingered me less than 30 times and gave me oral less than 10 times. I orgasmed once with him, the rest by myself before I sleep at night. In the past month, he learnt how to give really fantastic oral and gave me orgasms 50% or more of the time during sex/ sexual intimacy. Thats more than Ive ever received in the past 10 years added. The bad news is that we are probably going to end this 10 year relationship because he cannot accept the cheater that I have become. I have hurt him tremendously and it hurts badly to see him suffer because of my infidelity. This has been a tragedy for us. I am about to lose a really fantastic man. The man I thought I would spend the rest of my life with and it truly hurts very much. I wished I told him how important sex was to me. My SO said he completely did not know the pain it has caused me even though for years, I have been telling him how Ive experimented ways to lower my libido. I also asked to be pleasured but maybe was never direct or clear enough. It has to be super direct and clear so they have a chance to try and remedy the issue. Otherwise, do consider breaking up with your SO instead of getting into an affair as the hurt it will cause them is immense and irreversible. Please dont ever make the same mistake I did. For the first time in my life, I let my guard down and gave a third party the opportunity to come between my SO and I. I never planned to have an affair but it happened. Outsiders who are interested will be able to sense your vulnerability. And it will be difficult to resist their advances because come on, we are starving. I hope we all survive this torment."
40,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,"First post, HL22M with LL23F SSRIs and Depression ruined our sex life.",1,eiv7zp,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/eiv7zp/first_post_hl22m_with_ll23f_ssris_and_depression/,2020-01-02 18:37:02,"First post here. I'm a HL M(22) with my girlfriend (LL23) Grateful recovering porn and sex addict for nearly 2 years now. I've been with my girlfriend since senior year high school, 18 years old. She had no experience with sex, nor any actual knowledge of the points like oral sex, foreplay, masturbation, etc. She didn't even know what a clitoris was or what an orgasm felt like. None of her exes got past kissing her. Of course, after we experienced sex for the first time, and she had her first orgasm, we had sex on a very regular basis; our 'honeymoon' year (year 2) was comprised of almost daily sexual encounters and was intense and exciting. We had a great basis of boundaries and intimacy was off the charts for our first 2 years- and then her cousin passed away shortly into our 3rd year. *All* of her friends from high school left her to the dust (they were all pretty shitty friends), and I (and my friends) were pretty much her only friends outside of her family. Any new friends she made in college never contacted her again and pretty much did the same- dissed her out of the groups. Sexual encounters slowed down of course, to be expected, but she began the onset of major depressive disorder. At first we could always talk openly about our sexual needs and fantasies, but almost immediately after her cousin's passing she began rejecting more and more and arguing more often whenever I tried to initiate or talk about it. From weekly sex to monthly, she began to even starfish or just let me 'get it out' sometimes but that's not what sex was ever about to me. I loved the passionate closeness, the sense of warmth. I always let her finish first, but eventually she didn't even want to finish at all- let alone 'start'. I even blamed myself for trying to initiate so often and went to SAA meetings and attended therapy with her but to no avail- we'd try and talk but nothing would change. I read books about vulnerability, intimacy, boundaries, sexuality, and even sexual culture but she doesn't have any want to read them even though I know they would help. For the past 2 years it feels like my sex life has just been slowing, slowing down. I prefer not to use pornography, I specifically try to fantasize about my girlfriend if I have to masturbate, but I hate doing it alone and miss the closeness between us if I do. Granted; She's trying too for my sake; she and I thought that depression was the major problem and so she got on SSRIs a year ago, but that only made it worse. Nowadays it's a *maybe* once per month sexual encounter, and often it's not close nor intimate. I'm stuck trying not to use so much pornography since I don't want to get addicted to porn, and trying not to masturbate so I don't get addicted to self-gratification. I love seeing her crack a certain, genuine smile when we make love. Whenever I try to bring up my sexual needs or our lack of sexual intimacy, she always shuts me down, talks down to me like I'm always the one in the wrong, and hardly apologizes. I'm stuck always apologizing for 'making her feel like an object' or 'making her feel like I only care about our sex' when my intentions are just to explain how my sexual intimacy needs are being unmet, how I miss our sexual intimacy, how I just want to feel that closeness. Even this morning, New Years Day, I tried to talk to her about why I've been having to cry myself to sleep and why I have bags under my eyes, but she suggested talking to someone else about this issue, going back to therapy and SAA, and left me alone at home since I ""made her feel like shit."" I feel that a main reason she was never physical was her parent's divorce and her previous catholic school (before she went to public school). She never was around much sex nor had any space to develop her sexual instincts or habits. I was raised around 3 older brothers, sexually molested as a kid, and didn't have the greatest parents. She's a recently-graduated RN, so she's just job searching but we spend most of our time just at home playing games, taking naps, taking care of the dogs, and cooking. I'm currently working hard to save up money, since therapy sessions for me are nearly 200$ a session (hourlong) if we decide to go, and I want to move out and get started with my life. But I've come to the point where I'm at a standstill- 2020 is the ""Year of Clarity"" for me. She's perfectly happy with me and our current relationship, but I'm not happy with our sexual intimacy and she's well-aware of it. She can experience orgasms, but they are not as powerful as before (thanks mostly to the SSRIs). She can feel horny at times, but she never-ever initiates with me and sometimes it's like I'm walking on eggshells or a minefield if I try to initiate sex or even think of talking about it. In a surprising move, she admitted a week ago (around Christmas) that she wants to start weening off the SSRIs into this year. Whether that will improve our sexual situation I have no idea, but I'm genuinely hoping so, since our sex has been the main subject of arguments for the past 2 years. I'm tired of trying to fight her depression with her (though I recognize that it really isn't my responsibility) and tired of arguing about my honest feelings. I'm tired of the starfishing, the ""are you done yet"" stares, the shame for having tried to initiate over and over again. The shame for masturbating just to be able to feel any satisfaction at all. The tears I've shed just feeling useless, powerless, neglected, and misunderstood. I just want to be loved like I love her and hold nothing back anymore. We've had sex twice in the past five months. Both times we finished together, but immediately afterwards it's like it never happened and we just move on with our lives, never discussing our sexual fantasies or needs anymore. Thank you for reading, it actually feels a little better typing this out and sharing."

Many HLs here complain that their partner wont hug them when they are feeling down or sad. Wont kiss them even if its nonsexual. In the comments people chime in and call the LL spouse cruel for denying even basic levels of warmth. I get it, but from reading some of the posts I have a feeling that its not like youre sad 1 day out of the month and want a hug. Its that maybe youre sad or upset about something everyday and require your spouse to make you feel better. It goes without saying that spouses should be there for each other in tough times, but we also have to be adults who can handle our shit on our own and not rely on someone else to constantly boost us up. Showing your vulnerability once in a while is endearing and will make me reach out and give you a hug and make you feel better. But if youre constantly vulnerable, constantly feeling sad, constantly dont know how to deal with things that come your way without being coddled, and hugged, is that really my fault? Somedays I just dont feel like hugging anyone. Its that simple."

A lot of factors resulted in limited intimacy. My history with my husband is also super complicated--dating off and on for years before we finally got our shit together and managed to get married. But there was a period of time in our relationship where I doubted his interested in me sexually, where I felt insecure. My being a dismissive avoidant attachment style resulted in me shutting down and unable to enjoy sex. More specifically, the vulnerability necessary for me to have sex suddenly became inaccessible for me. So, I could see us both looking at our relationship and each thinking the other was the LL. I have processed a lot of my sexual baggage in this forum over the years, as well as in therapy. But I felt pretty shitty the year or two before we got married and that absolutely was one of the bigger factors into me losing my libido. In reality, our baggage--baggage he helped create--- prevented me from being able to believe he was interested and that made me withdraw and start to dissociate during or after sex. We probably should not have gotten married. We got extremely lucky that we were able to heal but really we had so much pain present before we exchanged ""I do."" I genuinely believe that if I were not a therapist myself we would have never gotten our shit together--I would have struggled to understand and accept what was going on. All of my defense mechanisms and delusions would have otherwise continued to dominate. This is just a tipsy rant-- I don't know what I am looking for but I am confident I will feel quite exposed in the morning when I visit the comments. I have no idea if any other LLs feel they are not actually the LL, but rather it's more complicated and the labels are less clear. Did an AMA that explains our DB a little more: [URL"

Me M(24) being somewhat of a recovering sex addict(never diagnosed, dont judge) I have a super high libido and use sex as a way to cope with many stressors in my life as well as enjoying the vulnerability and closeness and intimacy with my lady. My lady doesn't see sex as I do and doesn't nearly have the libido that I do. She can give up sex tomorrow and be 100% fine. Me on the other hand wouldn't be able to do it. So in the beginning we were having sex quite a bit, we were flirty and it was a good time. But now almost two years later we barely have sex she barely touches me. At first I thought it was because she was talking to other people or fucking someone else, but she is extremely loyal even when I don't deserve it. For the last couple weeks I've basically been begging her to touch me or even to fuck me, and she won't, so I've been trying to surprise her with sex in the morning like I've done in the past and she just gets super upset. So a few night ago one of our mutual friends tried to kiss her forcefully while I was In the other room and she has been having a hard time with it. So last night she sleeps naked with me for the first time in months and it was so nice to just feel her skin against mine. And I thought she was doing a bit better about the whole thing. So morning rolls around and I start tracing the curves of her body just in appreciation, and then I start getting aroused so I kiss her back and she feels how aroused I am and pushes back into me so I think she's awake and wanting to go further, so I try and Initiate sex and she gets pissed and tells me no and basically shoves me away. She told me she doesn't want to be around me anymore and she hates men and that I dont care about how she feels about the whole friend trying to kiss her and this is why she's better off alone. I feel like I basically tried to rape her and it just makes me feel disgusted with myself.. I dont know what to do now."

I just left a relationship of nearly 4 years over a lack of sexual intimacy, where I (30F) was the HL and my partner (35M) was LL. I'm optimistic about the future of my sex life, but I'm **crushed** over losing a best friend and the comfort/safety of our home. I still love him, but I know it wouldn't have lasted. It's such a mixed bag of feelings. In the beginning of our relationship we had all kinds of sex. The chemistry felt very nice. I had just come out of a series of very crappy relationships, and was determined to start this one off on an honest foot - I was *extremely upfront* about my kinks, my desires/fantasies, the value I placed on sex... all of it. He enthusiastically communicated that all of that excited and interested him and that he wanted to participate, and I was over the moon to think I had found someone so compatible in so many key areas. (Honestly he's a peach of a man!! So kind, so loving.) He was also very honest about his erection troubles due to SSRIs but, as most of us know, sex isn't all about the PIV - there are so many fun ways to get off (or not!) and enjoy yourselves. I was completely okay and understanding about this so long as we were both committed to communicating openly about what we wanted/needed at any given time. Unfortunately after 6 months, the sex started to wane. Quickly. I noticed that he was far less inclined to initiate any foreplay, I noticed that he couldn't stay hard, I noticed that his head didn't seem to be ""in the game"" when I initiated. He started sounding a little bored, and occasionally he would laugh at my dirty talk that used to work well for him (hey, maybe I sucked - who knows). But I was extremely understanding, of course! I dialed it back and spent more time nurturing him physically via massage, scratches, touches all over, etc. - intimate things without the expectation of sex (which I communicated and stuck to) so he knew that I was in this with him. We also determined he was likely having seizures around this time - he thought they were panic attacks, but they escalated into much more. This affected his confidence and desire, which was completely understandable. I was way more concerned about his health, obviously. We lived separately for the first year of our dating life, then decided to move in together. The sex still hadn't really gotten back off the ground, but because we were always communicating about it and I understood that he had health issues it really didn't prevent me from wanting to start a life with him. He said he was committed to figuring it out, and I trusted him completely. He and I had so much more than just sex to focus on anyway - we had a mutual love of all kinds of hobbies, loved going out on amazing dates (we're foodies), loved getting stoned and giggling at nothing, etc. Life was just fun with him, sex or no sex. We could do anything together and have a laugh. He was also incredibly emotionally supportive and reliable - I could call him in the dead of winter with a toasted car battery and he'd come running with a new one, smiling while installing it. That level of care was so new to me, and so precious. It was real love. Fast forward a bit - we had been living together for about a year, and the sex situation had not improved. In fact, it had worsened. The seizures had finally been treated, though he was very stubborn about whether or not they were seizures which delayed his treatment quite a bit. It took two years to tackle. I was noticing that he wasn't honest with doctors about the severity of his experiences. (Red flag: denial, avoidance.) He had also ramped up his alcohol and pot consumption, though it wasn't affecting his day-to-day. It just seemed to be giving him an escape each night, a way to shut down. He was still a loving goofball - that part of our relationship never changed, I just started noticing some patterns of avoidance that weren't previously obvious to me. I had had a few sex talks at this point, all of which came from a very reasonable and loving place. I was very cognizant of the way his ex treated his sexual dysfunction, and I refused to repeat any of those hurts. He was always very receptive to the conversations, but I noticed I was the only one initiating them and that although he agreed to take action, he did not follow through unless prodded. Eventually, after another 6 months passed, I started to feel that my self esteem was slipping into a yellow zone. I alerted him to this fact. I even did an embarrassingly drastic thing and cut my beautiful long hair into a pixie cut given that he only draws sexy women with short hair and had repeatedly suggested I try the style. (It worked for one night, he initiated immediately after I showed him and then never again.) I said that, from experience, this is the starting point for resentment and other sticky emotions to begin forming for me specifically. I could feel them forming through the panic and self-blame. I did not want those emotions to boil over and cause too much damage, so I let him know exactly what path those feelings were on - told him that when resentment enters the equation for me I stop feeling as invested in the relationship which could spell the end if not dealt with properly. I asked if he would visit a sex therapist with me, because I found it very distressing that after 2 and a half to 3 years I still did not know how to turn him on, still didn't know if he was attracted to me anymore, still felt that my desires were not important. I went to the first session alone, then he came with me for the second. He spent the entire session sweating profusely and acting very nervous - clinging to my hand and laughing a little too loud and making weird little jokes when the therapist asked him questions. I started to feel very badly about ""forcing"" him to come - it was clearly not a comfortable time for him. The second scheduled session came up, but he had run into a spot of trouble at work and said he was ""too stressed"" to consider going. I went alone, and the therapist called our sexual compatibility into question and debriefed his behaviour with me. I did not book another appointment, as I asked my ex to please let me know when we could return (so as not to stress him out re: work) and he never did. I got my own therapist after a while, and she too mentioned that we were likely not sexually compatible. But, every time I mentioned this during another talk I initiated, I got the same response: ""I love you so much, you're the best thing that's ever happened to me, you're the hottest girl I've ever been with, of course I'm wildly attracted to you... I just have spontaneous desire, sorry."" I tried to work my kinks into our play, because it's a relatively easy thing to just talk to me about and allow my mind to wander - if he could engage me like that, I felt I might be okay to take care of myself just knowing he was participating in at least that way. That did not pan out either, as he never initiated the sexy chats. I asked him several times if he was into it, comfortable with it, and he said yes. On the rare occasions that he did want to have sex, he was ready in an instant and I had to catch up quickly. The foreplay was lacking and he did not seem to enjoy touching me, there was no oral for me (he had an aversion from one bad past experience), he would do things that only seemed to serve his own pleasure (rubbing his erection on my butt which became painful after a while, pushing into my tailbone), I always had to be on top, there was no kissing during, he seemed to only be able to focus on one thing at a time - frankly, it felt like very lazy sexual effort and it was turning me off. I very kindly gave lots of pointers and tried to integrate them into sex, but he would shush me while he was touching himself to concentrate on maybe cumming. Then I would have to ask for him to play with me. It wasn't satisfying in the least for me and I felt so guilty. Here he was, initiating like I asked, and I still wasn't happy. That fucking sucks for everyone involved. At my urging, he got himself a sex therapist. He attended 5 sessions and the only revelation he brought home was ""I should shower you before going down on you, I want to practice going down on a girl."" I reacted poorly to this, I admit - I broke down in tears and told him I did not feel like being his oral guinea pig, that I took my hygiene seriously, and that I had suggested this exact thing before. That all I wanted was for him to want to go down on me, not to tolerate it or use me for practice. Suddenly some *man* suggests it and it's an epiphany moment? I was just so worn down from rejection that I snapped. I regret reacting that way, as he promptly stopped sharing the contents of his therapy sessions with me. I know it was not appropriate of me. He then proceeded to take ""2 months off"" from therapy to ""pursue his goals"". When I asked what those goals were, he simply said ""to fuck you more"". Nothing happened. Finally, the frustration was starting to wear me down in a big way after 3 and a half years. I felt I had tried everything - the patience, the understanding, the love, always initiating loving/serious/honest talks (so much vulnerability and trust), the medical help (he had also tried Testosterone at my suggestion/finding out he was low and switched SSRIs a couple of times), I cooked healthy meals to try to keep him feeling trim and therefore confident (found out he was hiding junk food though), keeping myself physically and mentally fit, etc. I just really, really tried because I wanted things to work, I wanted us to both feel happy and fulfilled however I could swing it. Very recently he and I had a talk where I expressed that we should consider an open arrangement. He was vehemently opposed, stating that he's monogamous and has fears that I would ""find someone better"" which I get - it's a scary prospect if you haven't researched what it could be. I explained what I would want out of the arrangement, explained that he would always take priority, etc. - he said no. I said that it felt like I was trapped given that he wants me to be monogamous sexually but not have sex. He then said he would reconsider, and I got him a very good book to read to hopefully soothe any nerves or at least give him solid research to consider. After two weeks he hadn't said anything, so I had to ask - he finally said it would probably be ""the only thing to help the situation"". I was not sold on his decision, knowing what I did about his preference for monogamy. It felt like a ""last ditch"" and that was breaking my heart. I wanted him to come to me with that information, to not hide it... to be proactive about sex for once. It was also during this conversation that he dropped a very big truth bomb - he was never and will never be kinky. He was never and will never be interested in my specific sexual desires. I was very, very hurt by this. I had had so many talks about not wanting him to feel pressured to do something he didn't seem into, kept checking in, etc. and he always said everything was hot and fine. I couldn't believe it, I trusted him to be honest with me and here he was saying ""I thought that I would just learn to like it, I really wanted to like it."" I understand he didn't omit this truth out of malice, but it hurt just the same. During our last ""big talk"" I told him that I would leave if he hid any truths from me. And here he was, telling me he did exactly that after promising he wouldn't. So, friends, I forgave him and tried to move forward with the open arrangement... but it just did not feel right at all. His behaviour was erratic in the days following the chat, and as soon as I felt that I could have the kind of sex I had been missing for 4 years... I knew it was over. I knew **I did not want to manage more responsibility** **re: our sexual lives.** I was done. If I was going to let my freak flag fly, it would have to be on my own. How could a man who was averse to licking a pussy handle seeing me come home with bruises from a spanking? It just didn't seem viable or fair. It seemed like a very long road I no longer had the energy to walk. I was honestly so tired of feeling like I had to hold his hand through it all, and that feeling sucks. *I did not want to feel that way toward him.* When I ended it, he was devastated. It was the most painful thing I have had to do to date - the sobbing, the non-verbal moments, the hyperventilating, me knowing he wouldn't want to be friends with me after the fact... I lost my happy home, my best friend and the man I love. I'm so sad that sex came between us, so sad that all my efforts made no difference. I'm sad for him and I'm sad for myself. It's really not his fault, it's okay if sex isn't a priority for him. It's okay that he's vanilla. It's all okay, it just sucks major ass that he wasn't able to be up front about that sooner. It sucks major ass that I compromised my self esteem for a relationship that I knew couldn't work long-term if it remained relatively sexless. What doesn't suck is that I did not allow very serious resentment to enter the picture, just like I said I wouldn't. That's not how I want him or I to look back on this relationship. I want the happy times to come to the surface first. I love him, I love so much of what he gave to me, I want for us to be as happy as we possibly can in the future. I want the kind of sexual relationship I need, and I want him to be with someone who is fully compatible with his needs. Thank you for reading, if you got through it all. It felt really cathartic to type it all out. I hope my story gives someone else the courage to move on if that's what they need. It fucking hurts, it's going to continue to hurt... but in time I think we'll both be better off."
45,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Post-sex update: Things are very good. Turns out LL husband actually finds me attractive - I would have never guessed...! Still speechless. - New elationship dynamic.,8,djcqvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/djcqvr/postsex_update_things_are_very_good_turns_out_ll/,2019-10-18 08:06:14,"TL;DR: After sex a few days ago, things are so much more relaxed and open. I don't think we have ever been in this place before, not to that extent. Husband told me he finds me attractive. &amp;#x200B; Hey everyone, hope you are doing ok :-) &amp;#x200B; For some reason my spell check doesn't work so this is bound to be full of typos which I hate, but, ah, whatever, lol. ;-) Just wanted to quickly post an update: after our intense sexual experience a few days ago (HLF and LLhusband - probably not all that LL anymore so I don't know what to call it:-)), we have experienced yet again another shift in our dynamic. That passionate encounter has led to a lot more relaxation and a lot more openness between us. I am proud of our improved communication. I cannot believe that two people who were terrified of ANY kind of talk or discussion are now just sitting opposite each other, talking in a relaxed, trusting way, knowing that what we say will be ok and not a big issue. The calmness and the openness are new. I find that there is a difference between openness and vulnerability. The term vulnerability seems to include the possibility to get hurt, while at least in our case, being ""open"" seems to be possible because of a great inner strength, almost as if we cannot hurt each other, because we know the other means well and because we are aware of our own inner strength. With that one, glorious fuck a few days ago (sorry, I cannot call it any other way) we have made ourselves vulnerable and saw that it was safe to do so. That has given us a new stability and courage. I am emotionally so relaxed, it is astonishing. Now when there are days where we have a few metres between us, just relaxing and chilling, I don't experience that distance as painful anymore, I am completely fine with it. We have established that we can talk about sexual things without awkwardness and tension; we know that if in the process of getting back to regular intimacy something should happen that could ""ruin the moment"" like it can happen when people have sex regularly as well, just silly stuff like a cramp or trying new stuff that somehow doesn't work, it won't be a big deal. In the past, I would have been so stressed because I would have feared that the smallest thing can prevent us from intimacy (""It's too cold, let's take a break"" or something like that), but somehow, now that we have broken through that one barrier, it seems to be in pieces and I don't see any danger for it to be rebuilt any time soon. It is as if we are on a new level. A few days now after our encounter, there's no sex, and I am fine with it. Today was a tough working day, and I thought: would I actually want to suck him right now..? No. I'm ok. And he was ok. We made a few flirtatious, sexy remarks with a good dose of humour, and before he left we kissed passionately. The atmosphere is shifting more easily now from relaxed and not overly sexual to hot. I found that very interesting, and this new flexibility came quite unexpected. All it needed today for example for that shift to happen was me allowing myself to look at his mouth for a few seconds longer than usual, as if he was a sex object (no disrespect intended, but yeah...:-)). A sex object that I love, of course, lol, but I just wanted to feel that mouth on mine and didn't care much about anything else. Just *wanting* it. I realised that there are different kinds or levels of ""passionate""; there were passionate kisses in the past, but they were much more emotionally passionate than I had realised. Today when I looked at him like this, he got this sultry, very serious look in his eyes for a good few seconds - argh, too hot for words...! The kiss felt different than those passionate kisses in the past; it felt uninhibited, a bit selfish, almost ""dirty"". A kiss that says ""I'd fuck you. Maybe not right now, but yes, I'd fuck you."" No lovey-dovey stuff. Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course. :-) And yet, it was not emotionally cold or detached. It was just a different kind of emotion. I believe what helped as well to achieve our new openness and comfortableness was that after we had sex I told him how I had felt so unwanted and unattractive, and I asked if he actually found me attractive, and he said yes. If I think of how hideous and repelling I have felt for such a long time...! I told him, and he while he understood, he said I couldn't be more wrong. Turns out he was attracted to me all the time. Unbelievable. I am not angry, and i can't quite understand why. It's as if the last bits of anger and resentment and pain are just miraculously dissolving. Strange, but I'm not complaining. So he has seen me in a vulnerable state, sharing such personal things that could be ""dangerous"" to ask. That makes it easier now for him to share personal things with me. He's always been a clam, and somehow there emerges this completely new persona that is just really grown up, mature, fearless and comfortable with himself. Just in the moment I thought I couldn't find him any more attractive...and that again helps me not being so much of a clam anymore either. Because, make no mistake, I used to be the queen of the clams without even realising it, lol..! Where in the past we feared that vulnerability would put us in unbearable emotional danger, we are now experiencing that openness makes us stronger. I have ordered lube and condoms. Not sure when we will use them, but that is ok - my inner despair has disappeared, the painful emotional urgency is gone. However, that my husband asks me between kisses if we have condoms because he wants to fuck me so much and I have to say ""No, we don't"" (I didn't say that the last pack was years out of date, and to be honest I'm quite proud that i didn't, it was so tempting at the time but would have not benefitted anyone in this situation), that is something that is not going to happen again...! ;-) Have a wonderful week everyone, take care."
46,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,I feel like Im in the acceptance stage but I dont have an exit plan. I need help.,30,dm0dip,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/dm0dip/i_feel_like_im_in_the_acceptance_stage_but_i_dont/,2019-10-24 01:49:44," It still fucking hurts and my anxiety is through the roof but I think Ive finally come to the point where Ive realised there is no return. I had a dream last night, I dream most nights about our DB and him rejecting me, but last night was different. I dreamt that he really wanted me, everyone and everything was getting in the way but he still persisted. He was sexy, he was passionate, he had to have me. This isnt some version of him that Ive made up, its how he used to be with me. This is the person who would fuck me every chance he got, too distracted by his desire to even watch a film. Someone who would caress my leg in the car until he couldnt take it anymore so hed pull over and fuck me right there and then. This is the person whod have sex with me outside and get me off secretly in public. It was so much fun, and I was so turned on by how much he wanted me. Waking up I realised that hes just not that person anymore, at least not with me. Regardless of whether its his fault or mine that we ended up here I cant see how we could ever be that connected again. Even if I figured out some magical way to get him to communicate with me I dont see how we can bring those feelings back to life. Im checking out emotionally to protect my self esteem and sanity. I feel like my depressive haze has lifted just enough to see that Im not completely hideous and that passionate relationships do exist and last. Hes friend zoned himself, something that he was so against in the beginning, he needed me to be his girlfriend he couldnt handle that other people were interested in me. Once he got me all of that desire fizzled away and Ive lost hope that its ever coming back. I dont know what to do at this point. I have no support system whatsoever, Im fairly certain my mother has a borderline personality disorder and my dads on the spectrum. They had a DB my entire life. Its a very toxic atmosphere and thats my only option right now. My sister is just like my mum and my brother doesnt speak to either of us. I have very little in the way of friends, I hardly connected with anyone at uni and the people Ive tried to keep in contact with I only see a couple times a year. Our main friendship group (mine and my partners) consists of couples, all of which have one or both people that have worked with him for years and I know that Ill be the one pushed out. I moved in with him because I thought we loved each other and thats all we wanted, all we looked forward to when we were long distance. But I fucked up, I put all my eggs in one basket and now Im stuck between unhappy and really unhappy. I think my own underlying mental struggles have contributed to the past 4 years of bad decisions and I only have myself to blame for that. I hated university, I nearly quit multiple times but Im stubborn and I pushed through to finish my degree even though I didnt leave my room for weeks on end, I didnt eat or sleep properly, I isolated myself because I only had enough energy to get the work done and stop myself falling over the edge. I have student debt now, Ive been unemployed for a year. I applied and applied to things I felt capable of doing but nothing ever happened. I moved to live with him in an area where I couldnt get work in the industry I got my degree. I dont blame anyone but myself for that, I chose to. I think I wanted to escape anything related to my time at uni, even if that meant giving up the things I was good at it. These past few months despite the constant anxiety and sadness Ive been trying to work on myself, Ive started making again and have been trying to get a little handmade business going of selling things online. Im starting to volunteer at an animal sanctuary, something I always dreamed of doing but didnt have the means. Ive started applying for jobs again, part time things to help support my own business plans. We live in a quiet, peaceful place which helps soothe my anxiety, I have animals and plants which give me love and purpose. I have the studio space that I always wanted and needed to make things at home. Im not constantly surrounded by people looking for conflict, Ive found peace in alone time. But we all know none of that fills the void of loneliness when the person you love is no longer interested and how that affects you on a daily basis. If I stay and let him support me financially, drive me to and from volunteering until I find a job, Id be lying about what this relationship is and using him and thats not fair at all. But if I leave, I have to give up everything, Ill no longer be able to volunteer and work towards healing my anxiety, I wont have privacy or space. Ill have to give up all of the progress Ive made which may not seem like much to some but Ive finally got some desire to live, to do things I care about again. I will have to give up my entire life as it is, which include the things that are helping me cope with existing. I honestly dont think Ill survive going back to my parents, to that house. Those memories, the screaming, the shouting, the sadness and madness. Back to a city filled with memories of people that left me and friendships that died. I dont want to go backwards. I dont see how any option is going to work. Hes a real person that I care about, hes looked after me for the past 5 years and hes been my entire support system, hes given me a home and a life away from my families insanity. He cares about me, but he doesnt desire me and I need desire in a relationship. I dont blame him for how he feels, regardless of his own emotional issues and contribution to the DB he deserves a partner not a child. Im a burden on him and I need to leave. Even if I could fix all of the things that Ive done wrong and get to a point where I can support myself I think our relationship has been too neglected and damaged to fix. I certainly cant move forward and be comfortable with him if we never address whats gone on. Maybe if I was financially independent right this second he would respect me enough to communicate honestly, but I doubt it. I dont think I can be dishonest, if I stay and dont reveal my intentions to go when I can Ill be living a lie. Its such a mess, I need help, I need some sort of plan that doesnt take advantage of the people involved but that also doesnt rip away all of the things keeping me afloat. I know the dark places I can fall into and I dont know if Ill be able to get out again. Ive written an incredibly long letter to him talking about everything. I talk about what Ive learnt through this subreddit and other sources of why people end up in dead bedrooms. I feel like Ive gone over every possibility right down to the fundamentals of how we learn to love as children as I know we both had difficult attachments as kids. Ive explained in detail how its affecting me emotionally, why Ive acted in certain ways, what I miss and what makes me feel loved. Ive explained why I think he shuts down and how that response damages my trust. Ive asked to know how he feels and what he wants, I need his honesty. Ive acknowledged my own part in it and expressed my intentions to change. Ive tried to find what options are left for us to make a last attempt to salvage our relationship. But even after all of that it just seems like it shouldnt be this hard, but maybe it is when two damaged people end up together and maybe Im not secure enough to have a healthy relationship. Ive tried to communicate and reach out so many times but its never made a difference. I dont think he can cope with that much emotional vulnerability and maybe Im not the right person to help him overcome that. I wanted to post the letter here, to get peoples advice. To see if I had been fair and clear in what I wrote and whether there was even any point sending it to him. If anyone would be kind enough to read it and give me some feedback Id like to share it but Im aware its incredibly long and may just get lost amongst other posts. I dont know if anyone out there has been in a similar position to me and whether they found a way out of dark places and managed to do it alone. I really need a plan right now, Im feeling incredibly trapped and hopeless."

Help?",0,dpx93k,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/dpx93k/went_through_a_rough_period_with_boyfriend_were/,2019-11-01 12:10:37,"Hi guys, first time posting here so sorry for any errors. My boyfriend (31M) and I (28f) --- together for about 2 years --- recently went through a stressful period in our relationship, including a temporary, but difficult move that had me working a laborous farm job six days a week. During this time, his therapist quit her job, he stopped going to the gym, and he went off his depression medication because he felt like he didn't need it anymore (spoiler alert: he did). I was constantly exhausted, he put on a bit of weight and wasn't feeling great about himself, and our normally 10/10 sex life took a nose dive. Before this, our relationship was AMAZING. We never ever fought, we were both super generous in bed, and we couldn't keep our hands off each other. We both have high libidos (though his is higher than mine) and are sexually adventurous, and the lack of intimacy affected our relationship. We ended up having a threesome with a female friend of ours, and my boyfriend developed EXTREME jealousy issues over her because she started to develop feelings for me. Basically, all of this culminated in us feeding off each other's frustration and own personal issues and led to a three-month-long period where we just weren't ""us."" He was verbally abusive on multiple occasions, and there were multiple points in which I was ready to leave. Now, my boyfriend has gone back to therapy, is back on medication, and has done a lot of personal work to be a better person. We feel like ""us"" again in almost every aspect, except in the bedroom. Sex is a very emotional thing for me, and when we were going through our rough period, I would flinch when he tried to touch me intimately. Even now that things are better, though, I'm still really struggling to feel sexual with him again. I still find him sexy, and I'm very much in love with him, but it's like something deep within me is biologically ""noping"" when he tries to initiate things. It's to the point where I subtly block my boobs when we're spooning so that he doesn't hold them, and I cover myself up when I change in front of him. When we DO have sex, even though he's super generous, it's HARD WORK for me to orgasm, whereas it never was before. It's like I have this fear of vulnerability around him now, and I feel awful about it because he's pretty much back to his ""normal"" self. Does anyone have any advice for how to get over this? TL;DR: Boyfriend and I went through a rough period and our sex life died. Now things are mostly good, but I still don't want to have sex with him and don't know why."

I still have some residual feelings from our last argument. I asked him to slow down a bit and then he said something sweet and I just broke down crying. Weird combination of that residual stuff, vulnerability, and this desperate longing for his touch and for it to just be easier between us. I couldn't hold it in or stop. He held me and was really sweet but it of course killed the mood, and I felt fucking miserable having done so. All this shit going through my head. I blew it tonight... how long til my next opportunity?.. Days?.. Weeks?.. What if this creates or deepens an aversion?.. How far does this set us back?.. Did I just derail everything I've/we've been working on?.. How the fuck do I fix this now? Things were very slowly but steadily getting better and suddenly lately it seems to have gotten more difficult. We talked the following day. I explained where my breakdown came from and he insists I haven't ruined anything or contributed to an aversion or anything like that. But we've yet to try ""reconnecting"" again. Things otherwise seem fine between us but I feel like I'm watching the clock and it's just crawling. And I'm trying to regulate my emotional shit and be cool but it's hard."

My boyfriend (40LL) and I (F37HL) have been together for 3 years. We're talking about marriage, but the semi-dead bedroom is the big thing (for me) that is holding me back from taking the plunge. What's not working, is that he barely ever initiates sex (once every few months), It's ONLY ever in the bedroom and in the morning after waking up, and when he does initiate, he does it in a way that is a total turn-off for me (just starts groping me, no finessing, kissing or playfulness). I've told him \*many\* times about all the things that turn me on, but he either isn't listening/remembering or doesn't want to, and goes straight for the grope. Even when he initiates in this way, I'll always go along with it, but gently redirect what he's doing physically and verbally so that I can get wet. In fairness, he's slowly getting better, but I have to fight off a wave of irritation when he rolls over and starts grabbing... I initiate sex weekly at the very least (but again, only in the bedroom, and only in the morning these are the only times he's responsive to it) he'll generally go along with it and seems to enjoy it. What IS working is that once we get going, the sex is great. It's a bit vanilla, but he's attentive and loving and is the only partner I've had that can get me to orgasm, *every time*. Also, not to gush, but he's an amazing person, someone I truly admire, and goddamn is he attractive...Even when he sucks at foreplay, I'm glad he's mine. What's also working, is that he is extremely affectionate. I get tons of kisses and hugs and cuddles and I love it! We also have outstanding communication -that is, for everything outside of sex. We've worked through a lot of tough conversations and have become so rock solid because of it. But sex has been a tough one for us to talk through. I can bring it up, no problem, but every tactic I try no matter how gentle or positive I try to spin it, only seems to make things worse. I know that how I'm bringing things up is probably a large part of the equation that isn't working. I'm really comfortable talking about sex, and I sense that he's *really* uncomfortable talking about it - Maybe that dynamic is part of it? He's never sexted me, or talked about details of previous sexual experiences with me -despite my asking. When I bring up anything sexy (wearing lingerie, watching porn, going to a sex shop together), he finds a way to sweep it under the rug. He was a bit of a late bloomer and given his background, I don't think that sex was ever important to him in HS or college, and it seems that this trend has continued into his 40s. When we started dating, sex was much more spontaneous and frequent. Now that it's died down, the cracks in this important part of our life are beginning to get bigger and bigger. I know he loves me and wants to spend his life with me, and I know he's open to having difficult conversations with me. But tell me, oh wise hivemind, how do I navigate this conversation in a way that will make him feel safe to open up to me and have a constructive conversation about our sex life? Are there any books you've read that have been helpful to read (either solo or as a couple) or videos or podcasts (I feel like a Savage Lovecast failure, as I listened to every podcast for years, and am still at a loss for what to do here)? I think I could get him to go to a couples therapist, but he's insecure enough about talking about sex with ME, that I think we'll need to talk it out together a bit before bringing in a therapist (and honestly, we've gotten through some seriously tough stuff in the past once we found the right way to talk about it. I think if given the right starting point, we could work through this). Any ideas?"
50,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,I'm sure some can relate..,2,dbofsv,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/dbofsv/im_sure_some_can_relate/,2019-10-01 15:04:52,"So me (f26) and my bf (m27) have been together for 7 years. We haven't had sex in over a year and very few times the past 4 years. It started out as me being LL because of birth control and life situations (both parents died within 2 years, high stress job, the works..) so I thought the problem was me. I definitely have rejected him quite a bit so he doesn't feel very encouraged to initiate and so I seeked therapy. I've been in therapy for about 6 months but I still can't get to the bottom of why I'm this way. I have an aversion to intamacy and vulnerability as well as confrontation and can't even talk to my SO about the problem with out breaking down and getting a panic attack. So we're just living as roommates and friends and just avoiding anything to do with the subject. It hurts so badly because I want him to be attracted to me and give me compliments but I can't ask him for it. And I don't feel comfortable giving them to him so why should I expect it in return? We're amazing friends and we get along great but our relationship is missing a very big part and I'm afraid we'll never get it back. I've always thought relationships were supposed to come naturally but this is tearing me up and I know it's going to take work to fix. Any advice on what to do from here?"
51,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,I'm thinking it's over...,8,ddgzlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/ddgzlh/im_thinking_its_over/,2019-10-05 11:51:48,"Longtime lurker first time poster. I (36F) have been with hubby (35M) for 8 years. We have two kids both under 5. We both work full time and we earn about the same. I believe he is a functional alcoholic. We basically have a dead bedroom, that started about the time my oldest was born. It could be related to porn, hes been working on it, but I believe its dead because I have turned from HLF to LLF, due to the underlying emotional problems I have--resentments and angerat him from 1. Communication problems in general; 2. His drinking; and 3. resentments I have from when I was pregnant and in labor the last time. 1. The Drinking When we were dating, I drank a lot with him. And we did experience problems. But I realized that my drinking was causing me problems, and I stopped drinking. He never made those connections or dedication to quitting. I accepted his marriage proposal, figuring the good outweighed the bad. (He was loyal and fun, and I didnt have much other criteria.) And for the most part, the good does outweigh the bad. For the first few years with our oldest, his drinking didn't change. (Weekends only. He shapes up during the week.) It's as if he just hasn't grown up. Hes wildly social with others, and likes to entertain people by saying crazy things. He invariably ends up hosting impromptu wild frat-style party nights where people look to him to be the 'life of the party'. He has brought random people home from bars (to our garage basically). One time I came out holding the baby and the person freaked, because even they realized how inappropriate it was for hubby to be out partying with them. The next day, at home with us, he was not social, he would sleep in and nap on the couch while I played with the baby. To his credit, this has gotten way better, where he will now most weekends force himself to get up within an hour of me getting up, and he mostly waits to nap while the kids are napping. His drinking has caused me public embarrassment on multiple occasions. Several years ago, my co-workers became concerned for me after an office party because he drunkenly kept repeating that he likes to punch women. Hes never been violent. He thinks its funny. I've asked him to stop saying those things, but I know when he's drunk he gets a loose mouth. Last month he got drunk during our date night and started yelling at an amateur wrestling matcha derogatory nickname about the wrestlers weight. (We live in a small town. Date night is wrestling.) Nobody else was yelling. I told him it was embarrassing me and I left for a little while. The next day he actually showed remorse when I told him about it. (This was surprising to me because when I tell him the awful things that he has told to me the night before, however, he never shows remorse. I can't think of a time when he has apologized to me without me asking him to do so. He thinks I start the fights or deserve it somehow.) Twice in the last two years I have given hubby an ultimatum: stop drinking or we leave. Both times he promised to stop drinking. Both times he stopped for a while, and then started again with no conversation or expectations or goal-setting. Ever since Ive known him, hes never been 30 days sober. Now, I want to stress that he has gotten a little better. He doesnt go out as often, and he gets up in the morning (most mornings) which is what I have historically\* stressed is what matters to me. ('I dont care what you do at night, just be active and present with us in the morning. Those kids get up at 6 no matter what you do at night'.) \*Interestingly, in re-reading this, I realize that this has changed and now I do care how drunk he is getting, and not just the hours he keeps. I should be honest with him about that realization. But while his drinking is less frequent, his drunken hostility has increased. A few months ago, I saved a kid from running into the road and getting hit by oncoming traffic--it was a stranger's kid. Oddly, I had a hard time processing it the whole rest of the day. It upset me unexpectedly and I didn't know why. I kept trying to talk it through with my husband, and I didnt realize that it was making him mad. I think it was a kind of typical male-female brain differences issue. He wanted me to say something and move on. I needed to talk it through on repeat. He has told me that he thinks I need a counselor, and has stressed to me that he is not my counselor. While I probably could benefit from counseling, as most people could, I believe he says this as part of his gaslighting techniques. I think he is insecure and setting me up for either legal or social judgments that might be made later on. Anyway, he got drunk later that night and we argued. I pestered him. He told me drunkenly that he wished he could hit me, because I have earned getting the f\* beaten out of me so many times. This was new hostility that he hadn't shown before. He would tell you that I was baiting him and trying to annoy him, so that's why he said I deserved it. I disagree, and we're probably never going to agree on what my behavior is. I can say apples and he hears oranges. I am constantly put on the defensive for even the smallest, most objective constructive criticism I can manage. As I said, hes never been violent. But that night I wished he did hit me, so maybe he would realize he is the one with a problem, and that the focus shouldn't be on me. Maybe I wanted him to hit me so our friends would realize he has a problem and stop enabling him by drinking with him. For the first time, I have actually considered if law enforcement could do anything. Most recently, I again received more hostility and anger from him when he was drunk). Hes given up the love. He has started baiting me, trying to get me to lash out. (And thats not hard, considering how my adrenaline flows in these moments. I have a history of throwing things, but proud to say I haven't done that in years. Five years ago he locked a door on me and I busted it in. He remembers that and this year he has locked the door on me twice, trying to make me act out so he can look better.) A few weekends ago, he came home drunk before 5 PM on Friday, which is not OK with me since it is in front of the kids. He got drunk again on the next night, late. I couldn't sleep and I finally went to check on him at 2 AM, only to find a party outside my house. He got defensive and accused me of making a scene and embarrassing myself in front of our 'guests'. I asked everyone to leave. He finally came in after 4 AM. He has a history of (drunkenly) bumping into furniture, falling down, and peeing in the bed. So when he bumped into a dresser in the dark room, I said out loud Jesus, hubby and that was all he needed to immediately tell me to shut the f\* up. His tone was dripping with vitriol. He laughed when I asked him to take the couch, telling me I was wrong about you for so many years. He was having fun upsetting me. Theres much more, but you get the idea. It was better until it was worse. 2. The Communication Problems We just suck at it. We both know it and havent done much about it. Weve seen a counselor, twice. Once before marriage, once after. She helped him before the marriage, and didnt really help us after. Hubby thinks I misrepresented things to her the second time, but I dont recall that. And hubby has a way of gaslighting and blaming me for e.v.e.r.y.t.h.i.n.g., so I dont really trust his statement. I do recall that he lied to her and minimized his drinking during the first go-round, which to me was the whole reason we were there. That upset me. I think he didnt want to be judged because hes a professional in the community. When I was pregnant, he thought I was being a b\* and so he unilaterally decided to give me the silent treatment for 2 months. I thought I was going crazy until he admitted it. I resent him a lot for doing that. 3. My labor, alone: Mini-TL:DR is that he left me to labor by myself for 36 hours. I was in labor-land and couldnt communicate with anybody else, so I really needed him. For those two nights, he slept next to me while I was in labor, even though I asked to be taken to the hospital. He also refused to time my contractions. Finally at 6 AM on the second day he woke up with the sun, rested. Because it was convenient, he finally agreed to take me. But first we had to stop for gas. I had the baby less than 15 minutes after getting to the hospital. Seeing those nurses at the ER door gave me the purest feeling Ive ever had in the world, and that feeling was pure relief. I was ready to have the baby by myself, in the car or next to a tree. On a positive note, I believe that being alone in a time of vulnerability like that has better prepared me for a slow and painful death, should that be my fate. Just typing this is causing anger in me to surface towards him. Clearly I haven't forgiven him. I did take him aside a few days later and yell at him. I prefaced it with ""I need to tell you some things, so just hear me out"" and proceeded to tell him how much he let me down and called him a POS. His honest reaction, crazy as it seems, was that he didnt know I was in labor. Why would I would want to be with someone for life, who cant look out for me when I need him the most? I suppose I am evaluating our potential retirement together. The qualities I married him for, being fun and loyal, are they what octogenarians look for? Or do they want someone who is going to call 911 in case of an emergency? Is he going to be cutting up on the cruise ship dining room while I'm on the floor in our stateroom, short of breath? Ugh. **Help! My Intention Going Forward:** I do agree with Hubby that the only thing on the planet that were here for is our family and our relationships. He wants to fix us, supposedly at all costs. And If I were the best person I can be, I guess I would dedicate myself harder to the relationship. I know that I have a sharp tongue and not enough patience with him. I have read some very inspiring posts on r/deadbedrooms, from u/MonogramishTooRisky about actions to help his sex life, becoming attractive, being his best. I love his action plans. And u/korn_49 and her turning the tables on initiating sex, recognizing her partners needs. For me, I could do more. I could read more books; go to seminars; I could attend therapy; I could work on stating my needs directly (as if I want to go to the hospital wasnt direct enough, ugh); I could work on identifying my feelings in the moment; I could get more friends and social groups to talk to instead of him (If I can find the time  I already I have a book club and I am very active through my work with civic engagements. With the kids on top of it Im exhausted.) But I frankly dont feel like putting in more work. I dont want to be the best person I can be. At the moment I am too full of anger and resentment right now to muster the initiative. I want to get out of this relationship, not fix it. He says the same thing over and over when hes sober--that he acknowledges he drinks too much. But he doesn't do a damn thing about it. This last time, he threw out the liquor bottles in an attempt to keep me from leaving. I am not celebrating. Knowing him, it will be Thanksgiving and he'll accept a margarita without a thought, just because it's handy. And what I have realized is that if I stay, it will be enabling more of the exact same behavior that has been on repeat now for two years. He doesnt have to deal with the memories that I do, because when there *is* an episode, he is often blackout drunk. (Though I stress that he is not often blackout... he's gotten less frequent, but still takes it over the top). I know what it's like to black out and not know what you need to apologize for. It is a horrible feeling, and the few times it has happened to me I apologized profusely to the person I knew I owed it to. Then I changed my behavior. But he doesn't even apologize. It's as if he has no remorse for his actions when they concern me. He doesnt remember the way he looks at me, the belittling language he uses, and the increasing hostility. He doesn't lay awake at night for hours. (I have trouble sleeping when he's not there.) I am stuck with those memories. He doesnt even know when he should apologize because he cant remember what happened the night before. I think hes speaking the truth when he says those hateful things to me lately. He continues to blame me. They say on the alcoholism threads that one shouldn't blame the alcoholic, but blame the disease. This is going to be a struggle for me, because how can I forgive him the things he says and does when he's drunk? Are those the product of the disease, or the product of a hateful and hurtful spouse who is suffering from a disease? As for the resentments, I dont think I even know where to begin regarding forgiveness. I am not a religious person. Try as I might to work on my communication with him, I don't think effective communication will remove all the resentments I hold against him for the past, would it? Our former counselor described resentments as a big bag of stinky garbage that youre hauling around behind you everywhere you go. Better communication might help us going forward, but how do I really cut that bag of garbage free? As for a potential split, I know that well have a successful and amicable split. Financially well be okay. I really believe that after we split, hell enjoy it. Hes perfectly capable of not drinking for the week when he will have the kids, and then after that he can invite all his friends over and get wasted like a frat kid before he cleans up for the next week. I will probably be the one to struggle a little bit more without him, which is depressing. And I really hope that I'm making the best decision for the kids. I asked him if if he was still going to stop drinking. He said he didn't know. I told him that no matter what happens, I hope he still stops drinking, for himself and for the kids, even if not for me. It is upsetting to me to think that he is using the promise to stop drinking only as a carrot on a stick, to get me to stay. I am starting to believe he is an alcoholic suffering from addiction, though he doesn't have the shakes or anything like that. He's not pouring vodka in a coffee mug to go to work. Nobody around him is treating him like he has a disease, he and I have both historically treated it like a choice. I have not attempted to 'blame the disease' instead of blaming him. That's a whole other thread I guess, and maybe if we can make the marriage work, I can be there to help him with it if he wants that help. What do you all think I can do? Am I being shortsighted? Selfish? Lazy? Am I being too lenient? What things do you think could help me and us? Am I capable of forgiveness? Has anybody really done that for good? TL:DR He's cut down the drinking but it's turning more hostile. I gave him an ultimatum before and now I'm ready to make good on it (and separate), but I admit I have issues too. Can we fix it?"
52,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,DAE feel humiliated? Paralyzed by hope??,3,cp6qw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/cp6qw7/dae_feel_humiliated_paralyzed_by_hope/,2019-08-12 13:22:13,Its only so long that you can practically BEG for attention right??...lay your cards on the line with complete honesty..have someone listen and supposedly care..say they love you etc etc...When you lay yourself bare..show all your vulnerability its humiliating when it doesnt end up making any difference over and over again. Its humiliating having hope only to realize youve fallen for just words...again. How longs it going to take to lose hope altogether cause Im finding that hope isnt a positive thing to have anymore. I want to walk away but hope is like some insurmountable wall I cant get past.
53,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,I am in a serious relationship with best friend. my lover. He is amazing. All the sudden our bedroom died 5 months ago. And I am not handling it very well.,9,cwje2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/cwje2a/i_am_in_a_serious_relationship_with_best_friend/,2019-08-28 21:19:07,"Hi I am (F29) he is (M28). We have been best friends for 7 years and and 7 years ago we started to date and than became friends with benefits because we weren't ready for a serious relationship. Few years ago he became emotionally more open and vulnerable. And emotion plus sexual vulnerability means we became not just best friends but madly in love. I know i am the passionate one. But when it came to sex he once would become so passionate. I felt bad for our neighbors when we had sex lol. We have been in a serious relationship for 2 years and in March 2019 that was the last time we had sex. It was last time he was so passionate with me. Now no matter how many times I talk to him about how sex is important for closeness and after all his empty promises of we will have more sex sure. He relies on only cuddling and emotional connection for us. It is not enough. I repeat not enough. After a day of a romantic plans he makes of adventure and restaurant I am turned on by how Romantic he is towards me. And I have no where to go with my horny self cause he doesnt want to have sex. So instead I cry next to him quietly than go lay on the floor so I dont cuddle with him so I can control my horniness cause if I dont I will stay crying cause I am sad that our bedroom died and cause i am reminiscing on how when we used to get back from a date he would squeeze my ass before we walk in the house, grab my hair and pull it and we would be passionately sexually get closer than ever, desiring each other like crazy, and feeling hot as hell. I miss him holding me tight as he does so many amazing things to me. Now when I get horny I reminisce and realize thats all dead now and die inside and cry quiety so I dont make him feeel bad and pressure him. He sees me and realizes why I am crying and says sorry I make you feel so sad. And he is such an amazing man why else would I be so in love with him. Crying cause I miss him? Cause he is amazing. I than feel bad for making him feel bad I said you are amazing all day to me planning all these romantic adventures that's why I am horny for you and then he says as a joke to make us laugh. "" I am amazing aren't i?.' And I am sad even more now cause we stopped making out we stopped kissing deeply and biting each other. I have to beg to get a deep kiss. And when he was gone for 11 days I asked for 5 minutes of make out and he exclaimed '5 minutes!"". I felt shamed by him. Slowly all physical touch is dying. I am a believer that emotional connection makes you best friends and sexual connection makes you lovers and once you are in a serious relationship it doesnt stop that you need both to feel wanted and accepted and desired. I think he thinks sex is a physical need for stress not for feeling close to the person you want to grow old with. I also think he doesnt want to have sex and he sees it as a chore. He doesnt even want to try and if I force him it gets worse. What should I do?"
54,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Interesting Title,3,cwvqyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/cwvqyd/interesting_title/,2019-08-29 14:02:44,"Hey everyone, I wanted to write down some observations I've made in my marriage. I'm (33m) the high libido, she's low. (29f) We've been together a total of almost ten years, married for almost three. Like anyone, we humped like twice a day in the beginning. Broke three bed frames the first year - lol! Have had the same bed frame for 9 years now. We had a long stretch from August 2018 to June of this year of no sex at all. (Ten months) Before then it was barely a few times a year anymore and it's left me frustrated sexually. At my age, I've gone back to school all thanks to her. We've never been a scorekeeping couple but she credits me for why she was able to finish her education. I've never thought of it that way but she wants to return this favor to me; of which I've seriously made my peace with and I accepted I'd never have a career more than my construction laborer thing. I seriously believe that this life will just have to set the next one (our future child?) up so he or she could get to go to school. So here I am. Thirty three and an intern and the stress of so many new things at once. I got a permanent job with the company so that's good. Between school and work, I'm stressed out and strung out to my limits and my point in all this is I realized that my stress seems to be a correlation to my desires for intimacy - to which I get none. Last June we had a fight about it. She is perfectly content with never doing it. I told her I love her but we aren't lovers. I was a shitty stormcloud that night and I said a few things I shouldn't have that she didn't deserve so I left and went to the bar. Got home and we did it twice in the same weekend for like 3 weekends in a row. Tonight and lately I've been cucked as we've gone back to the pattern during that ten month spell where I go to bed after trying to initiate but she'd rather wait out a while so there's a zillion reasons not to have sex. I feel unwanted. Unattractive. Rejected. I rub out more now than when I was 14! To make matters worse, I've met a lovely coworker that I am so beyond preoccupied with. I'm ashamed to admit this and don't really know how to vent that. I've been reading books lately about vulnerability and relationships and a few other things so being extra reflective and finally getting the courage to post my story. It's a lot of things right now and I don't deserve my supporting wife (in every way but my physical touch needs) I guess here I am in bed frustrated as heck. TL DR: I think my sex drive hits a frustration gear when I'm stressed out. I've developed advanced crush/infatuation feelings for a coworker. The only way I can seem to get laid now is to be semi abusive verbally at my wife. Maybe not abusive but lacking tact and just saying it like it is. I'm starting to wonder if this is it - and if I'm a fool"
55,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Perspective needed.,6,czqy5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/czqy5q/perspective_needed/,2019-09-05 07:18:04,"(42 hlf) me and hubby (46 llm). So basically hes been ll for our entire relationship. Kept telling me it would get better, of course it got worse. Went from once a week, to a month, to now, 2/3 times a year. Rarely PIV. No children, his ll ensured it. Even when we were trying we were never really trying because I hated how sex felt like an obligation to him. I chose him. Went through depression when I realised it was him or kids. Chose him. Depressed for a long time. Finally decided to follow the only other thing than being a mother I wanted to do. Write stories. In the meantime he finally acknowledged his depression. Hes had one since his first marriage fell apart. I had been encouraging him to get it dealt with since I realised he was depressed, a year or two into our relationship. Finally in 2016 he went on antidepressants. My hl had dropped during my depression so I knew the same was happening to him. I was okay with waiting as long as he needed. Queue this year. He was forgetting to take his antidepressants and not feeling the drop, meaning he didnt need them anymore. I tried to get him to see the doctor but realised pretty quickly that he was using them as a defender against any initiation I would make. He has a lot of those. From taking my hands off him if were messing around, to making sure I know how tired he is when he gets into bed, to taking an antidepressant if I suggest anything. Death of a thousand rejections. I was getting really frustrated, but until July I kept it all quiet. Finally though I had enough and after hearing him say he hadnt taken his antidepressants in over a week and had no drop it became pretty evident he simply wasnt interested in sex. The other side of this is that he likes making me horny, then walking away. After doing this one night I got my pillows and a blanket and slept on the couch because I couldnt stop crying. We finally talked and he promised things would change. A month later nothing was different so we had another talk. Two weeks later nothing has changed. I tell him Im sick of talking. He knows what the issues are and I cant solve them for him. Only action can change anything and he refuses to act. After a few days he went to the doctors to talk about his ll and to ask about the antidepressants. He was put on a lower dose and told to take them every three or four days. Then the doctor told him if he actually has sex occasionally, he will want it more often, thats how the body works. Something Ive told him in the past. So I wait patiently. He initiates three times which is great. But by now my body doesnt respond to him the way it used to. I dont trust him anymore. I dont trust him to get me horny because Im so used to him walking away. Now its taking longer for me to get worked up and hes impatient so two out of three times ends without either one of us getting anywhere. Today he initiated again and I was determined to relax and enjoy. Again, Im not responding to him as quickly as I used to and hes getting impatient. He gets to completion and (tmi) orgasms, the first time in ages because of the tablets. Im thrilled for him. After he wants to sleep. I had begun by telling him I was feeling vulnerable, usually when I tell him something like that he knows Im feeling a little needy and he puts in extra effort. Im not needy in general so when I say this he knows Im serious and hes always been there. But today he wants to sleep and seems surprised when I say I still want to. Three times I say this in different ways and each time hes surprised. I tell him Im going to need foreplay again because we concentrated on him and Ive tapered off. My lower back is an eroginous spot but it soon becomes obvious hes not interested. Hes rubbing my back in a general way, nothing foreplay going on at all. Then he starts snoring. I know a lot of guys fall asleep after theyve come, hes NEVER left me hanging. EVER. I wait for him for a bit, he wakes, rubs, snores, wakes, snores. I finally get up, hes apologetic and tries to get me back into bed but Im just too hurt. I let myself be vulnerable with him, was honest about my trust issues and vulnerability and it feels like he was only out for his own. Now hes pissed at me saying Im over reacting. If I had just gotten back into bed everything would be fine. He was having a nice time, like Ive ruined it. If I bring up that I have trust issues from nine years of being sexually denied he acts like Im being unreasonable. Hes defensive and angry. The worst thing is I know if we returned to just not having sex, hed be happy. The rest of the relationship has always been great. Hes my best friend. Hes so supportive and always there for me. A little thoughtless about special occasions but thats far from a deal breaker. Ive always believed in open channels of communication and believe a relationship can only work when people talk about stuff. I walked away earlier and to be fair he, eventually, let me. But how much more talking do I have to do? How many ways do I have to explain that Im having trust issues. That hes hurt me so much. It feels like this is all so much of an inconvenience to him. Ive literally told him what my issues are, what I want to happen to resolve it, he keeps asking me because he cant remember. Because to him this is only a big deal because Ive made it one. That the problem is me and my demands. And thats not to say Im only concentrating on my demands. Ive asked him what he wants. Upped the BJs he gets to try and up his labido and so he knows its about him as well as me. Ive explained I would like head, hes never gone down on me at all. He promised two months ago hed look into it and just cant make himself do it. When things were new I tried to resolve this then, it was only when I realised he was depressed that I decided to step back while he dealt with that but it was 4 years before he even began. I get hes trying, Im trying to be patient but I feel like hes only biding his time until I stop asking and he can get back to normal. He denies everything. He finds me sexy, he denies rejecting me, he claims he wants to have sex. I dont know how much longer I can do this. I dont equate sex with love. I believe he loves me, but I need the intimacy of sex. I need to feel like my husband wants me. I really dont feel it. Turned into a bit more of a rant than Id anticipated. Sorry for the hot mess. TL;DR after nine years of rejection husband tried, then promptly fell asleep leaving me hanging. Worse because Ive lost trust in him sexually after how many times hes wound me up and walked away. Feels like hes only there for himself now. Tells me Im over reacting. Dont know how to feel about it all anymore."
56,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Can't bring myself to say yes,1,cbvw7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/cbvw7h/cant_bring_myself_to_say_yes/,2019-07-11 23:51:15,"28F married to 32M for 5 years and sex has always been a problem but it gets worse every year. It's been over a year since we had PIV and we try touching/oral/mutual masturbation maybe once every 2 months. I'm that stereotypical horrible wife that most of you complain about (for good reason). I always have some excuse because I just can't bring myself to say yes to trying. We don't kiss or hug or hold hands. We don't touch unless we're saying goodbye or goodnight and having a brief peck. I'm not attracted to him and he won't work out. He even goes on these camping trips with his friend to bike but then he doesn't bike. More and more I often don't enjoy being around him anymore because he's grown so serious and talks my ear off about things that don't matter (yesterday it was detailing all the hypothetical things for his next camping trip next year down to eating bananas and oatmeal for breakfast. Why does he think I need to know that??) Yet he won't open up about how he's feeling or what he thinks or feels about me. He doesn't ask about me (doesn't even know the name of the place I've worked at for 6 months) I don't know where I stand with him but I feel unloved, so I say no to sex, and then (I assume) he loves me less. So we're in this cycle. Our therapist suggested we read The 5 Love Languages. I read it in a week, took my time, wrote extensively in a journal. This was a month ago. A few days ago, he read the part on words of affirmation and said that was for sure his main one. Otherwise he hasn't read anything else, asked me about mine or even considered figuring it out. He doesn't seem to care. I get that he has limited time after work but he's had full days off, including many where I'm at work and he has the house to himself. That book is really short so he just doesn't care. The latest thing our therapist suggested is to watch Brene Brown's special on Netflix about vulnerability. This was 2 weeks ago. He hasn't mentioned it once so I guess I'll watch it by myself. He's on his own journey and I'm not a part of it. I guess if I could just say yes and have sex with him anyway, he'd let me in. But I don't know him and we don't seem to care about each other anymore. We talked about ending it about a month and a half ago and he clearly said he didn't want that and we agreed we were going to work harder. Yet here he is, working a lot, talking about minor surface stuff again, asking for sex out of the blue. No effort to be found."
57,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,I feel like my girlfriend (22F) doesnt care about my (21F) feelings at all,0,ccmh4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/ccmh4i/i_feel_like_my_girlfriend_22f_doesnt_care_about/,2019-07-13 17:07:06,"TW: sexual assault, self-harm Long time follower, first time poster. This is probably gonna be a super heavy read. I'm sorry about that. also, note that we've only been together for 10 months but we're stuck in certain living &amp; financial situations that would make it too difficult to split right now. So a little backstory. I'm not sure how common this is for sexual assault survivors, but I've recently realised I have a huge fear of feeling aroused, to the point that for a long time, I just couldnt properly. whenever someone or even myself would touch my clitoris in a sexual way, i would begin to feel something, but then it would just stop. I would masturbate but I would completely zone out and only do it to quickly relieve triggering feelings. it was not an enjoyable thing for me. a few of my partners tried getting around the issue with no success. my ex girlfriend was an assault survivor too and she got me close, but still, nothing. a few months before my current partner and I started having sex, I tried training my brain into feeling sexually towards her by thinking of her while I orgasmed. fast forward to a few months into our sex life (after about 5 or 6 months of training myself), I was able to finally orgasm with her. it was so amazing, and for a short while, we had amazing and satisfying sex, which I've never gotten to experience before. A few months after that, things started to decline. she would say she was worried about how she performed, or that she was too tired to return anything, which was fine because everything still felt safe. Then, it turned into her very rarely wanting to touch me sexually at all, including intimate kissing, or even getting undressed in front of me. after about 7 months of slow decline, today, she has told me that she doesnt wanna have sex anymore During the decline, I was able to understand that my shut-off feeling towards sex was there to protect me. I'm stuck in a situation where I've completely opened the possibility of arousal being a safe feeling, even though its not, and it's extremely triggering for me. I've tried masturbating, but that has been met with extremely harsh arguments and ultimately making her uncomfortable, so that wasn't an option for a while. we eventually had a talk about that. I told her how extremely stressed it made me feel to not be able to get rid of that feeling. we came to an agreement that I'm allowed to get myself off while shes sleeping. I've tried a few times since then, but even the smallest movements in bed wake her. [note: there are barely any times where we are separate from each other in a time I could masturbate e.g. in bed] I'm not comfortable leaving the room or asking her to leave so I can masturbate. Having her know the exact times I'm feeling stressed makes me feel too vulnerable, especially with how those feelings have been handled in the past. For instance, there was one horrible night that we started getting heated. her hand was down my pants, and she was touching me, but it suddenly stopped. I felt so extremely uncomfortable that I like the only way to stop it was to hurt myself on my genital area (which was subconscious, but common with assault survivors I believe). she thought I was getting myself off in front of her and she left the room. when she came back, I felt like I was begging her to understand what was going on. her responses were nothing more than ""but it looked like you were jerking off"", ""I thought you were touching yourself and it was making me uncomfortable"", etc. the completely blatant disregard of my self harm situation made me cry and scream the point of wanting to vomit. I've honestly never been upset to that point before in my life. she never stopped to console me that whole time too. there was a period of time where I wanted sex to be completely out of the question (before it already was) so that I potentially wouldnt expect it and possibly, I would return back to feeling nothing about sex again, like before we were together. that seemed to only agitate me even more, so that was basically dropped. I eventually set rules for each time sex might happen like, this time I wont orgasm, this time I wont let her touch my clit, this time I wont let her touch my vagina at all. all of that didn't really do much to help my vulnerability though. I just feel so trapped, and so gross. to feel this stressed about something in the relationship but recieve next to no sympathy from my partner makes me feel like I must be so disgusting and unworthy. she used to tell me of her ex boyfriend who she stopped having sex with too, but her reasoning was that he was gross about sex &amp; gender roles and stuff, kind of expecting it from her as she's a woman, etc etc. she said the sex with him was completely one-sided too. I feel like I have to be worse than that in order for our sex life to crash quicker than it did with them. I've tried asking her why things stopped. I've expressed my frustrations, including how i feel worse than her gross ex, but she can't tell me anything more than ""the honeymoon phase ended"". I've never been in a relationship where the honeymoon phase ends and the sex completely stops? and to be shut off to helping me at all too??? I understand that she doesnt owe me sex, and that I'm not entitled to sex, but its extremely difficult going through this without the feeling of being understood or cared for. it feels like her feelings are the be-all and end-all. i mean, in other cases, it should definitely be like that, but there's way more than sex between us that shes refusing. I feel like she should be putting more effort into finding solutions with me, or at least making some small compromises. I'm not sure what I want from this post. it's good to at least finally get this off of my chest with people who can empathize"

Loooong, lol.)",20,cmy2i1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/cmy2i1/i_hlf_am_not_ready_yet_to_have_sex_again_and_i/,2019-08-07 09:38:32,"(TL;DR: Stopped the pursuit and am changing my attachment style. Positive results.) &amp;#x200B; DB for years. In recovery for a year. Stopped the pursuit only a few months ago. We're doing better, as my other post shows. Several months ago, I decided to stop the pursuit completely. I realised annoyingly late during this process that this is not enough. The DB and other factors increased my anxious attachment style. So, more work on myself. &amp;#x200B; Goddammit, changing from an anxious to a secure attachment style is like coming off of heroin. Not that I know what this feels like, but this is what I imagine it feels like. Panic attacks, paranoia, depression - hell. And then one day, you realise that you feel lighter. It is the most alien feeling. You can breathe again. You can lean back and lose yourself in a book, without thinking of your DB, or your partner, or how to solve it all. You realise, with greatest astonishment, *that your mind is calm*. Where all the racing thoughts went god only knows. This is me, as the centre of my life, the protagonist of MY story, not that of my partner. I sleep better. I feel grounded. There is a solid core at the centre of my being that was not there before. It might be some form of confidence, this shy animal that I thought our DB had chased away forever. Now I feel independent and strong, and I don't care what tomorrow brings, because I feel in charge of my own life, DB or not. Who would have thought that letting go would be that empowering... In this agonising and elating process I have realised that I am not ready to have sex. I want our DB to last a bit longer, because I am not ready to reconnect. I am not stable enough. I need to change so much more before this can happen. If I reconnect physically too soon, there's a danger that I lose myself and my newly found, healthy position. It first needs to become more solid. That I myself don't want for things to go at a different pace than they do right now makes it easier. It is true, though. I am not lying to myself. Would I like us to have sex every day, beginning tomorrow? No. Because my development as a person is at this point more important to me than the topic of our DB. I have come so far, and I am not jeopardising my progress. &amp;#x200B; All of this is yielding results. I don't want to jinx anything, but it really does get better every day. The emotional reconnection between us is staggering, and I am grateful for what we have right now, and I see it grow all the time. Our communication is getting so much better, and that was the hardest part. Blood, sweat and tears, but we are getting used to the idea that being vulnerable doesn't mean we're about to die, lol. Because that is what it feels like when you think you cannot open up your heart and soul to that person you love the most in order to share your emotional agony and your joy. I am proud of us. As Jordan Peterson says: Whether you speak your truth or remain silent, both has consequences. It's your choice. Someone here recently compared turning a DB around with turning an aircraft carrier around. YES. A hundred times yes. However, I am not the ""fixer"" anymore. I am living MY life, and it is THAT that brings us closer together. Something changes in the atmosphere between us. We are calling each other by our first names instead of using a generic, vapid term of endearment. That means: I am speaking to you, *and I mean you and no one else.* Our eye contact is so different now. It is never random or careless, or spiteful or cold. It is so direct and intense, and it lasts long. When we speak with each other, we are fully focused on the other person. Sometimes when someone else says something we disagree with, we will exchange a glance without a comment. We speak to each other with our eyes. In over a decade, this has never been a ""thing"". I hardly touch him anymore. Sometimes for days. When I then touch his arm or the back of his neck for a second or two while passing him, without any intention behind it, it feels different, and it has a completely different effect than my touch had before. And I know I need to make it even rarer. The ever building sexual tension that is caused by my withdrawal and our mental reconnection is something I did not expect. A few days ago I found it hard to breathe in his presence, and he felt it too. We didn't speak about it, but one could tell. An entire day like this. Where I take the discipline from I don't know. This is the new principle: no touching, just eye contact and interesting conversations, and the odd flirtatious remark or smile from my side, very briefly of course, and a tad aloof. And then I will instantly ""forget"" about him, and my book will be the most interesting thing in this room. I can feel how he tries to draw my attention back to him. It is almost as if we're playing the game of ""whose pull is stronger"". In the meantime I'm collecting old shirts that I otherwise would have discarded. They may not be torn from by body any time soon, but that is ok. I can always use them for painting. ;-) The one exception from stopping the pursuit was a few weeks ago when we were on the phone. Tension and flirting while talking about everyday things. He started a sentence with ""This time next year -"" and I couldn't help myself. I interrupted him: ""This time next year, I'm going to fuck your brains out."" He was speechless. But he was not repelled. I think he just never heard me talk like this. I used to be scared, timid, withdrawn, and years back I actually was the LL. Poor communication was one of the reasons. Well, welcome to my new self, darling. In the process of my self development, I feel that for the first time, my vulnerability makes me stronger. I am HL, and that is my truth. I am ok the way I am, with my emotions and desires. And he is ok the way he is right now, too, and I let him be. I am not pouring my sexual energy over him anymore no matter if he likes it or not (and I told him to tell me when he feels uncomfortable with anything, because his happiness mattered to me.) My sexual energy is MINE. I may be willing to share it one day, but I will decide when. Some time ago we talked to my great surprise about initiation, or just approaching the other sexually, how to do it if one wanted to. I don't even know how it came up. I said: ""Well, if you want me to come to you, just call me. And if I feel like it, I might come. You know what it's like, every day is different, one can never tell."" For some reason he likes this. He doesn't say anything, but the way he looks at me when I say such things... He never looked at me like this before. And of course, I don't really notice, because I'm busy reading. ;-) I know why he likes this. I don't suffocate him anymore with my anxious attachment style. I let him be. I am happy with myself. I don't NEED him. I tell him if he doesn't want to text or call, he doesn't have to. Just days and days without communication. It's all fine. At the same time, I make him feel emotionally safe: yes, you can withdraw from me if you need and want to, and I will still love you. I may not be always available, but I will still love you. You need your breathing space, and I need mine. The latter is so much more true than I ever thought. I need at LEAST as much breathing space as he. I feel charged with energy since I don't waste it anymore on someone who doesn't want it in this abundance. I feel alive, and I am happy. Today I listened to that song below. It is so strange how, in the light of our DB and its recovery, the lyrics seem to get a slightly different meaning: [URL &amp;#x200B; (Nothing else matters - Metallica) ""So close no matter how far Couldn't be much more from the heart Forever trusting who you are And nothing else matters Never opened myself this way Life is ours, we live it our way All these words I don't just say And nothing else matters Trust I seek, and I find in you Every day for us something new Open mind for a different view And nothing else matters Never cared for what they do Never cared for what they know But I know..."" &amp;#x200B; To my husband, the love of my life, even though you won't ever read this: I love you, darling. I think we're going to be ok."

Also need to say before I get slammed that I've tried all the most advisable ways of fixing things ie. talking, opening up, laying yourself out to the point of feeling stupid the next day. No real changes, great sex like once every 6 (average) weeks. Trust me she isn't cheating. Just lazy would rather be on Facebook. I have realised my own methods work in some ways where I don't give her the satisfaction of the chase, maybe I be a little off for a few days and she gets concerned I've had enough (I usually have, so not like I'm acting) and then I hit her with a suggestion of sex and it's more likely to be accepted. The Mr Nice Guy book seems a bit like this if I'm not mistaken? Any success stories where the partner actually realises 'wow I need to get my act together'. I no longer show her vulnerability and what I wish I had in life in terms of affection etc like we all long for. I feel as though it turns her off. (Eye rolls, 'oh not this again'). Like I need to be an alpha type of asshole seems better. 10 years together. Not leaving. I dream of being with someone else but for now just trying to get more from what I have. Thoughts?"
60,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,The letter Im giving her when I leave,47,c0a655,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/c0a655/the_letter_im_giving_her_when_i_leave/,2019-06-14 05:24:38," I left. The divorce papers are under this letter. No this is not a joke. Im sure you probably feel blindsided by this. Trust me this was not an easy decision and I didnt make it overnight. I wanted to do this in person but you would either A.) Cry, tell me how much you love me and beg me not to leave. A manipulation tactic I wont fall for anymore or. B.) You will lose your shit and start throwing things. Quite frankly Im afraid of you sometimes, you have a horrible temper. I told you in February or March that I was unhappy and wanted to go to counseling. You blew it off and pretended like everything was fine and we just need to do this that and the other and things will be better. Things get better for a month or two and then it goes right back to the way it was. I am miserable. I feel trapped. Im tired of trying. I feel like this is eating from the inside out. We just need to agree that we are not compatible with each other and move on. I need you to know that there is no one else, I am not cheating and no one made this decision but me. Im not trying to make this a personal attack on you, Im just giving you the reasons that made me come to this decision. Last year when you snapped on me telling me to stop bugging you for sex, that you are old at 42 and menopausal, that I should be happy with the sex life we had and I just need to accept it, it broke me. You were so cold and cruel about it, at least I can appreciate the honesty. I know where you stand. I cant, do not have to and WONT accept it. When I married you I took a vow of monogamy not celibacy. If I wanted to be celibate I would have become a priest. You do not have the right and will not force me into celibacy. The definition of a sexless marriage is 10 time a year or less, we are pretty much at that point. A sexless marriage is a deal breaker for me. You are broken, I am broken and our marriage is broken. Its a little toxic actually. 10 years of you constantly rejecting me has caused me to build up so much resentment towards you that theres no amount of counseling that would make me want to stay with you. At this point you would probably agree to go to counseling to save the marriage but I dont. I asked multiple times and you made excuses or blew it off and so you made the decision for me. I know people will find this hard to believe but I think you were a little on the abusive side to me. The last time I initiated sex you about ripped my head off and then asked me if I was giving you an exam down there. Almost every time I initiate you act like Im a thorn in your side, make snide comments and make me feel like youre just doing it to shut me up. I dont want to have sex with someone who isnt interested so I stop trying, you complain we arent having sex and cycle starts all over. This is pure lunacy. Although a sexless marriage is a big reason as to why I left its not the only one. There is such a thing as a self-fulfilling prophecy and you are the queen of it. I feel like you convinced yourself from the beginning that this relationship wasnt going to last and you subconsciously did everything you could to sabotage it so you can feel sorry for yourself. When we got serious and picked a wedding date you started saying I wasnt serious and I was going to leave you at the altar. The reason I wanted to elope and get married before the real wedding was to prove to you that I was serious and because I got tired of listening to you. Then after we got married you started accusing me of cheating on you. The last time I told you I was unhappy you accused me of cheating. I find that funny since your father was always accused your mother of cheating and look where that landed them. DIVORCED! At the same time you were accusing me of cheating you talking about your toxic Ex nonstop and were driving past the bars he hung out at looking to see if his car was there. Who does that?! You were rejecting me in the bedroom and crying about how he got kicked out of the house and didnt have anywhere to go. You told me you still loved him, so why did you marry me? I was the nice guy with a good job thats why. I was a schmuck thats what I was. Your impatience and constant complaining has sucked the life out of me. I feel like a drained battery that cant be recharged. Everybody says we are so good for each other because im so laid back and you are so high strung but there comes a point where enough is enough. I can only take so much and Im at my breaking point. Im tired of walking on egg shells trying not to set you off. Living with you is like walking around with a grenade attached to my belt. There can be an explosion at any second. You can go from being in a good mood to raging mad in seconds. Do you think this is normal? Its not. I have seen you slam doors, throw shit, punch walls and stomp your feet like a 3 year old. You are emotionally unstable and you need help. I know you say thats how have always been but that doesnt make it right. I cant even open a cabinet door without being asked what Im doing. Im a prisoner in my own house. When your hours at work got bumped up I took on extra chores and did everything I could to make your life easier. You chose to use your spare time doing nice things for everybody else. You have admitted to taking me for granted multiple times but you never do anything about it. I never felt like I was a priority in this marriage. You may not feel thats true but I do. You are also paranoid on a pathological level. You think everyone is out to get you, youre always getting fired at work even though you have been promoted a half dozen times. You are thin skinned and take everything people say as a slight against you. Everybody is annoying. According to you I walk too slow, take too long brushing my teeth and blah blah blah. You have a woe is me glass is half empty attitude. You come off as being ungrateful quite frankly. You have a good job, a nice house and car and husband that loves you but you pissed this marriage away feeling sorry for yourself. You love to tell people what to do and god forbid anyone tells you what to do. The bottom line is youre not an easy person to live with and you can be a hard person to love. You find it hard to be vulnerable because vulnerability is weakness and thats not an option for you. You dont give me compliments and you make it very clear who wears the pants in this marriage. All Ive done is love you and all youve done is push me away then tell me how much you love me. This isnt healthy and I cant do it anymore. I dont want to turn this divorce into a shit show but I kinda think it will."

So yesterday, I made sure every excuse was accounted for. We had both showered that day, he wasn't too hungry or too full, we both weren't tired, house was clean, kids were out with grandma until tomorrow, every errand had been run, neither of us had work the next day, I knew we were both feeling emotionally secure, we didn't have to be anywhere for the next 6 hours, and when we left all we were doing was seeing a movie with friends. Then he told me he invited his friend over 5 hours early, and I lost it. I don't know what came over me but I cried so hard because I felt like a failure. He won't even fuck me when I make everything perfect and comfortable, because when we come back from the movie he would be too hungry and/or tired. He got so shocked at me crying, but said he knew that I wanted to be physical. He said he didn't invite his friend over on purpose, he rather just forgot that we had pushed our plans back. So he told his friend to go get dinner and meet us there so him and I could talk. We then had the longest talk we have ever had about any of this, and we both broke down. He says he doesn't know why he makes excuses, and that he does sometimes get horny but hardly ever around me. He asked me to pray for him. He thinks God has been testing him. He used to be so into me physically and has no idea what's happened the last few years. He feels just as lost as I do. He told me he found me attractive in that moment, but was too scared to be vulnerable. None of the excuses are real, he just doesn't know how to be vulnerable anymore. I told him I wanted to help. I can't remember what happened next, but we talked about vulnerability, masculinity, and had sex. Like, kinky sex we used to have in college, not the classic wait-for-me-to-come, is-it-over-yet sex. Afterwards, he said he feels like he gets horny at inopportune times, so he never brings it up as to not be rejected (lmao). Like, he will look at me after I fall asleep, or if he's in the shower and I'm downstairs, and that sometimes he watches me change but doesn't want to bother me while I'm getting ready. I can't believe that this is happening. I told him to wake me up, to text me with a codeword in the shower, to call me over when I'm getting ready - I can be late to work. He said he will. We had sex again this morning."

TL;DR: gf treated me well for 1 year and it went downhill from then on. &amp;#x200B; I was 18 and she was 19. Before we started going out she was the one that was interested in me and even though she did not take initiative for our first date, she shyly made it clear she was interested. On our first date, she made the move to kiss me. We dated for about two to three months. We lost our virginity to each other and I asked her to be my girlfriend. I had planned this day beforehand and bought a plushie as a token of our relationship. She loved it. I used to spray my perfume on it to let her remember me and she found that gesture sweet and liked it. In the beginning it was awesome. She'd initiate as much as I would. Cuddling, caressing and non-sexual touch was frequent from and to each other. She loved when I caressed her skin with light touches. We used to exchange love and passion-filled messages to each other almost daily. Sex was good, sex was frequent (2 to 3 times a week) and I believe she liked it as much as I did, since she'd initiate, since she'd droll with pleasure shamelessly showing its presence in her face. However, soon before our 1 year relationship anniversary, she started changing. She'd sometimes treat me badly, like venting on me for bad things that happened in her day or whatnot. I was stupid and naive. I thought that maybe by trying harder to be a better boyfriend things would change. Maybe I was insufficient, lacking, limited or weak in some way. The outcome couldn't have been worse: I'd humiliate myself in order to keep our relationship, she'd abuse me sometimes and just treat me badly. Showing vulnerability and weakness was a hug mistake I made. God! Did she capitalize on that! She even admitted at one point that sometimes she'd provoke a discussion just so I'd feel bad. Still, I was romantic, stupid, naive and whatever adjective you believe fits me here. I loved her, truly. By this point we're two and a half years together. Sex was something like once every one or two months, always initiated by me. Soon before the 1 year anniversary the DB had begun. If there were sex, it was the most vanilla sex you can imagine, no oral, she didn't even let me go down on her even though I enjoyed doing it. Of course she didn't go down on me either. When the 3rd year anniversary came I snapped, at least a little. I stopped being the good boyfriend I imagined I was. I used to make and buy cute gifts, like: a love card by hand, buy a necklace with a heart shaped pendant which contained our pictures inside, build a romantic comic in notepad style about us, give her flowers os small gifts on non-special dates, prepare some snacks and put them inside her bag with a love message without her knowledge so she'd find it out during her day... Not anymore. I no longer caressed her, no longer wanted to massage her (and she really enjoys my massage), no longer bought or made her gifts. I still loved her, still wanted her to love me and desire me. And boy, did I desire her. She's not the most beautiful woman in the world. I believe people would rate her as a 6-7/10. Not for me. I could be blind and still see the woman I love as beautiful as a divine being. She noticed the change. I did still treat her well and her friends recognized I was a very good boyfriend. But something inside me was dying. Sex was... Sex wasn't. By this point sex was either she laying on top of me or me laying on top of her, a purely mechanical act on her side, no interest, no action and me trying my best to pleasure her, to make her feel good. I didn't care if I came or not, I just wanted to see her face filled with pleasure as I've seen in the past. She says she loves me, a lot. I do love her. But from then on nothing changed. She would never shower with me, she didn't like to be touched sexually, only being caressed and massaged but far away from her breasts and vagina, of course. Vacation sex? No. Of course not. How could I ever consider that planning a trip, solving the whole logistics by myself, make the trip she liked and picked happened... How could I consider that doing those things more than once would change? She didn't feel comfortable doing it in a hotel, yeah, the hotel was the problem, she wouldn't admit it was either me or her. Now we're 7 years into this relationship. I want to marry her and she feels the same, at least she says. If and when we have sex, it's always initiated by me. She says she feels good when we do it and she does orgasm, that much she doesn't or can't fake. She asks for some space and time to sort herself out since moving in together is a nearing event. Two weeks later we talk and it seems she wants to go back. However I fucked up at a personal area in my life, nothing related to her, but it was something that could hinder our plans. She does not want to go back to me because of that. We broke up. It was something she didn't know, only came to know when I told her shit was getting real. And I do know I fucked up big time by letting her know only when shit was getting real. We're three to four months without sex at this point. I sorted myself out, fixed whatever was necessary and things turned out ok in my life, all in the span of one week. So, my problem did not last long. I asked her to reconsider our relationship and she is thinking about it and says she misses me. &amp;#x200B; She's been thinking for three weeks now. I've found this sub, read several stories and found out I have a DB. I've been through two to four months without sex. I've had her just lay down and tell me ""go, do it"" just so things would be over. I've been through some not nice experiences. She doesn't stroke my hair, she doesn't tell me I'm beautiful (except when I say I find myself to be ugly), she doesn't caress me, she doesn't have me sleep on her lap, she doesn't send me messages at 2am telling me how much she misses me and is in love with me. It's not just sex. I've done all that for her and continued doing most of that up until she broke up. She didn't do that for me for most of the relationship. Close to our 1 year anniversary was a milestone that marked the ending of the love, attention, intimacy and sweet treatment I received. In the end we were much like roommates and she had a servant. Kissing? Lips touching only, no more than that, tongues are forbidden. Hugs? Yeah, we had, but I need more than that. Some people don't, but I have my limitations, weaknesses and vulnerabilities and I NEED PHYSICAL ATTENTION, I NEED PHYSICAL INTIMACY, I NEED TO FEEL LOVE, I NEED TO FEEL DESIRED. Besides touching lips that didn't last long, some hugs and a handjob once two or three weeks, I had pretty much nothing. &amp;#x200B; I'm not perfect, far from that. I was not the best boyfriend in the world. However, did I try to be the best. Did I try to manifest that love for her. Did I try... Now that I've found the DB world, what others go through and what I've been through as well... Now part of that love is turning into anger. I don't know if she will ever reach back to me to either decide we ended it for real or if she wants to get back. We talked a bit last weekend and I told her that if we were to get back I'd like to feel loved and so on. I don't know if I want to get back. &amp;#x200B; I am so confused and frustrated right now. I don't know what I should feel or whether I'm the asshole in this relationship. I just wanted to vent and maybe get some feedback. Thank you if you've read so far."
63,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Help me do this right,0,br5l9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/br5l9u/help_me_do_this_right/,2019-05-21 13:47:36,"Throwaway account. Short-time lurker but my wife (34 LL) and I (33 HL) have been had trouble in the bedroom since the beginning. Both Christian background, virgins before marriage, only ever been with each other. We have sex regularly (probably frequently compared to most here), but it has been duty sex for as long as I can remember. I prepared this (really long) letter to her. I would love any feedback from the community about it, especially Female DBers. Is this the best way to tell her how I feel? I have tried to tell her so many times but she never gets it. I want to be firm that how things are/have been is not an option for the future. But I'm also desperately in love with her and want to do everything to make this work. \[Mrs. sadanonymousman\], I love you. My life's goal is to die as an old man holding your hand. I am deeply unhappy in our marriage. Because of sex. I have tried to explain how I feel so many times and I've either not been able to express myself or else I feel like you don't understand what I'm saying. Even if you understand, I don't think you appreciate the gravity of it. So let me be clear: our marriage is in trouble. I can't keep going through life telling you that something is deeply important to me or that I am deeply hurt and then have nothing change. I'm at the point where I feel like the only option is to check out emotionally from our marriage to keep from getting hurt again and again. I am doing this in writing so I can better express my feelings and you can better understand them. I feel completely sexually defeated. Up until we were married we had incredible sexual chemistry. I remember the thrill of the thought of having sex with you. I remember discussing wanting to be sexually generous, have regular sex, be adventurous in our sexuality, and explore a completely new and unknown side of each other together. Although the novelty aspect of sex has passed, I feel exactly the same as I did back then. I crave an intimate connection with you that can only be achieved through sex. I want to sexually explore you, and explore my own sexuality with you. I want to be completely sexually vulnerable with you and have you trust me with your sexual vulnerability. I tried to research this so I could better describe myself. Here are my thoughts: **1. Sex Is a Physical Need** Sex is a physical need for me. The best analogy I've heard from that is in the focus on the family link below under the physical need section comparing it to how a woman feels after not breastfeeding. I don't know how that feels, but her description is very similar to how I feel about having sex. My body is wired to want/need regular sex. From what I've experienced, that has been around every 3 days or so. Sometimes shorter, sometimes longer. I want to have sex so often because *I'm literally made that way.* I can't do anything about it. I'm not being a sex maniac. I'm not being a creep. This is just who I am. This is a healthy and appropriate desire. I wish there was some way for you to experience my physical reaction when you are not interested in sex on or after that third day. When you tell me you do not want to have sex, I immediately feel my blood pressure rise as a wave of fire courses through my body. I immediately wonder what in the world I can do to relieve this physical need. That eventually transforms into deep sadness and depression because you are the sole arbiter of my sexuality. If you're not giving it, I'm not getting it. And I'm just trapped in a river of sadness and raging hormones that I can't do a thing about. Oftentimes this turns into resentment. Sex is my core need and it infuriates me to be rejected, especially when the corresponding reason for the rejection is reading 59 chapters that day instead of 58, or an extra few minutes of sleep in addition to the morning nap. I don't think you understand or intend any of this when you're not in the mood, but it feels like you are putting something of negligible value over something which will literally change my mood from miserable to happy for days. I have been much happier since we have been having more sex, but we both know you don't want to be doing it. You are just doing it to humor me. This is great for the physical aspect of sex, but terrible for the emotional. **2. Sex as an Emotional Need** This is the part of our sexual relationship which makes me profoundly sad, and which I am (still) unable to fully express. While sex is a physical need for me, that aspect is a distant second in terms of importance. Sex is so important to me because that is how I connect with you emotionally. *Having a sexual relationship which is sexually arousing for you, and in which I am desired sexually by you, is the most important thing in my life*. Please read that sentence again. And again. Every word. If there is one thing I need you to understand, it is that. I can't say what I mean any better than that. Here are some quotes/excerpts I found after researching the issue (all linked below) which echo what I feel and give words to what I have failed to express to you: * A man's ability to perform sexually, to arouse and please his wife, is central to his confidence as a man. The impact ripples into practically every other area of his life. * One of a mans deepest emotional needs is to feel that his wife desires him. And if he sees that his wife desires him, it gives him a sense of well-being in all the other areas of his life. But if she shows &lt;big sigh&gt; Okay, fine, lets get this over with, then it is clear to him that she doesnt desire him, hes no good at trying to make her feel amazing, he must be completely undesirable and that she doesnt really care about him the way she says she does. * Dr. Archibald Hart, in his extensive work regarding male sexuality, has concluded that a man's sexual prowess and the need to perform sexually is a fundamental emotional need. * A man can have sex with his wife every day of the week and still feel emotionally rejected by her. Having his wife just go through the motions isn't enough. Again, he longs to know that he is pleasing her and that she is sexually interested in him. * Although the average appears to be a few times a week, there is no one right amount of sex that men need. Instead, the one constant is his emotional need to feel that you desire him. * In the research, there seems to be no one standard amount of sex that men need to have; it is what sex signals to them that is important. Your sexual actions signal: I desire you; You are desirable; I want to be with you in that way; You make me feel amazing; I want to show you how much I care about you; and on and on. * a mans most emotionally vulnerable time is when he approaches his wife for intimacy. A man feels like he is shakily extending out his unprotected heart, not knowing whether she will tenderly embrace it or smack it down. * When I talk about a sex-starved marriage, its not about the number of times per week or per month people are actually having sex. After all, unlike vitamins, theres no daily or weekly minimum requirement to ensure a healthy sex life. Instead, the sex-starved marriage is one in which one spouse is longing for more touch, more physical closeness, more sex, andheres the rubthe other spouse is thinking, Whats the big deal? Its just sex. But its a huge deal because its really about feeling wanted, loved, and connected. I cannot describe how deeply it hurts me when you reject me sexually or that our sex life is reduced to ""duty sex."" I feel emasculated. I feel disconnected from my family. I feel insecure. I wonder why I'm with a woman who rejects my deepest desire. I feel like I have no purpose in life. I feel like a failure in all of the other areas of my life. I feel like there isn't a person on earth who wants to connect with me intimately because the only person I can have an intimate relationship with - the one person I want to have an intimate relationship with - doesn't want me back. I know your first reaction to this is going to be: ""I don't mean to make you feel inadequate when I reject you, so you're just taking it the wrong way."" Wrong. 100% wrong. You might as well tell someone to not feel hurt after hitting them because your intention was not to hurt them. It just doesn't work that way. My reaction is my psychological and biological makeup. I cannot change how sexual rejection makes me feel. Even if I could, I wouldn't. I deserve to be in sexual relationship in which I am wanted and in which I am able to sexually please my partner. I think your second reaction is likely to be: ""I don't reject you."" Also wrong. Since having kids, I honestly can't remember a single time when you truly wanted to have sex with me. If there are more, it would be news to me. You may ask on a birthday or other special occasion, or you may beat me to the punch if you think I'm going to ask anyway, but let's be honest: all of our sex is ""duty sex"" where you are having sex for all of the reasons except for the one that counts - you actually wanting me sexually. If there was nothing else in the world, if I had no sexual needs, no expectations, nothing, just you and your wants/needs, how often would you want to have sex with me? Deep down, we both know the answer is next to nothing. That is the problem. I am not sexually wanted. If I could make you read this section a million times, I would. I cannot be in a marriage where I regularly hear detailed descriptions about why and how you don't want to have sex with me. It is emotionally devastating and I'm not going to do it anymore. Life is too short and you only get one shot to live it. I deserve to be with someone who doesn't make me feel impotent. **3. Your Sex Drive** We both know one of the core problems is you have a much lower sex drive than me. How can you desire something you don't want? Frankly, I don't know. As far as I can tell, we seemed to both be very interested in sex prior to our marriage, and I think we had similar expectations of what our marriage would be like. Sex has been hard for you. I empathize with you over that. But at some point it feels like you just stopped trying to resolve the problem. How many thousands of books have you read during our marriage? How many of those have been about sex and working through your issues with it? How much time have you spent researching potential solutions? How many therapists have we seen who could help with that? How often do you talk to me during sex to make it as pleasurable as possible for you? How often do we discuss what is and isn't working in our sex lives? How often do you tell me what you need emotionally in our relationship to help you feel safe and secure when it comes to sex? I just feel like you haven't cared about this for years. I do not view you as a sexual failure because you have never orgasmed. I do view it as a failure that we've all but given up, and you seem content with that. Despite all of our issues, having sex with you, and specifically orgasming in you, has been the best experience of my life. The most fulfilling moments in my life (my life - not just my sex life) are those in which I feel like I am pleasing you sexually. Your never having orgasmed doesn't make me view you as a failure - it makes me feel like a failure. I am desperate to fix this but I feel like you aren't. The person I married was passionate, intimate, and sensual. I know she's still in there somewhere, and I would love to spend some time with her again. **4. I Am Not a Sexual Deviant** I feel heavily criticized for my sexual desires - quantity, wanting to try different positions, different places, etc. I had begun believing that there is something wrong with me for wanting you. After researching and thinking about this, that is totally incorrect. In fact, I think my sexual desires are fairly conservative. Some of the lower links below talk about sex surveys. Virtually everyone has had oral sex in their lifetime and a substantial majority has recently. One article was talking about more educated people tend to have more oral sex. Even anal sex is fairly prevalent, which I've only suggested once because you completely shut down afterwards. It is not strange or prurient for me to want to explore different aspects of sex with you. It is not healthy or appropriate for me to have to beg and plead for it. I think our disagreements on this track a lot of our other issues. How many times (less so recently) have I told you that I wanted to try something new to see if it helped with you liking sex? How many times have I told you that I like different positions because it feels (even if we both know it's not true) that you actually want me sexually? I am not a sexual deviant. Please stop treating me like one. **5. Your Body Image Issues** Another hiccup is your not wanting to have sex because you have body image issues. In your words: ""I hate my body."" In my words: ""I don't."" Do you not see all the times I check you out? Have you seen me stare at you when you get out of the shower? Have you seen me stare at you when you put your gym clothes on? Have you seen me stare at you in that blessed mirror in our room during sex? I think you are smoking hot and want to do you up, down, all around, from every angle, in every position, in every room, and probably a few times outside. If you have a mental block about how you look: why? Do you think we were only going to have sex while we were in our 20's? Do you think sex is something you only do when you are in the best shape/appearance of your life? Is there some audience in our bedroom that matters besides you or me? Even if being in better shape were a prerequisite to sex, I don't understand why you wouldn't change it. If you don't like the way you look, then change the way you look. If you really think you need to be in better shape to have sex, it kills me that you prioritize countless naps/books over getting in better shape. It makes me feel that you value that 59th chapter over your sexual relationship with me. As it stands, I am trapped in a sexual relationship that is severely limited because: 1) you have an incorrect belief that I am not attracted to you; and 2) about which I can't do anything. Either accept that I'm extraordinarily attracted to you, or, if you can't, change your body until you can. **6. You Are My Sexual World** One of the things that resonated with me from the articles below is the feeling of being trapped when your one sexual outlet and partner isn't there for you. You are it for me. When that fourth day comes and my body is screaming at me to have sex, I only have you. I can't have sex with someone else. I can't masturbate. Once you turn me down, I am trapped in a body of raging hormones, irritability, and resentment until you set me free. The same can be said of how we have sex. When you insist on having sex with the light off or your shirt on, it isn't a choice like orange juice or apple juice. Because you are my sexual world, the effect of your choice means that I will never see a naked woman. I will never have sex with a naked woman. Ever. There is no indication that will ever change, and in fact things only seem to get worse. I'm not going to live that life. If you want to be my sexual world, then be my sexual world and not my sexual sandbox. I don't think you understand how difficult it is to live in \[our city\], in 2019, with the internet, with a wife who will not let you see her naked. There are half-naked women everywhere. Media/videos/ads are everywhere, and virtually all of it has some sexual component to it. Do you have any idea how difficult it is for me to live in this world with a wife who would prefer to have sex once a month in pitch dark without me touching or seeing her? Your gut reaction to this is probably that I am asking you to meet my sexual demands and if you won't do that then I'm going to get it elsewhere. That is the exact opposite of what I'm trying to express. All. I. Fucking. Want. Is. You. More of you. All of you. It's just difficult to live in a world that constantly showcases sex knowing that the one person I want to experience sexuality with isn't sexually interested in me. More important than the physical aspect of sex is the emotional. I tried to outline above how I feel above, and how our sexual relationship affects every other area of my life. I need an intimate relationship with you in order for the rest of my life to function. Not because of a physical release. Not because of a sexual obligation. Because my life has no meaning or purpose without an emotional connection with you. I need the intimacy, vulnerability, and bonding that comes from pleasing you sexually and knowing I am sexually wanted. Without an intimate relationship with you, there is nothing to build the rest of my life on, and certainly no reason to build it. **7. Conclusion** I'm deeply ashamed and embarrassed about this, but the hurt is just too deep to go on. This is my cry for help. For whatever reason, I have not been able to express this to you. I'm not going to break down sobbing (in front of you). I'm not going to throw a fit. But I am deeply hurt, and have been for years. I am emotionally checking out of our marriage, and nothing good lies beyond that. We're not going to make it if things keep going the way they are. We need a fundamental change in our relationship. We need a fundamental change in our sex lives. I need to know that I please you sexually. I need to be sexually desired by you. \[sadanonymousman\] Articles (please read):Note: A lot of these articles talk about never having sex or infrequently having sex. I think we do have sex, but it is duty sex, which satisfies me physically, but not emotionally. I don't agree or resonate with everything in these articles but hopefully this gives an idea of where I am. [URL This one probably had the best summary of how I feel - there are 8 different sections.

I'm 22F and he is 29M we met about 5 years ago and have been together ever since. He loves me and I love him. I love him more than anything. He is my reason for life. But we have never been on the same page sexually. He was a virgin before me and I most definitely was not so I was understanding when our first time having sex was awkward, he was new to this after all. We didn't have sex much but we lived in two different cities and I figured he would be more comfortable with it as the relationship progressed. Then we moved in together. We would sleep in the same bed every night, shower and dress together but sex just never happened. I would try to initiate and would get turned down every time and it freaking hurt. Eventually I got scared to start anything because of how worthless the constant rejection would make me feel. He would never initiate so we just stopped having sex. I loved him but I didn't feel loved back in the same way so I would try to talk to him about it and he would always have an excuse ""I don't feel attractive enough for sex"" ""I don't like feeling so vulnerable. "" etc and I would reply honestly with ""I think you're very attractive"" and ""love requires vulnerability"". Then he would promise to try harder and he wouldn't turn me down the next time I asked and then we would go another 3-6 months with nothing until the cycle repeated itself. Eventually I was so hungry for physical affection that when a guy at my work hinted that he is interested I started having an affair. It lasted about a month until I felt so bad coming home to my boyfriend I knew I needed to end things. I moved back in with my mom and kept seeing this other guy for a while but I couldn't give him anything serious because my heart was broken so I ended that too. After a month or two of separation we met up to exchange some stuff and the way he looked shocked me. He had lost a good 30 lbs and had dark circles under his eyes. He admitted that he hasn't been eating or sleeping enough and told me that he has never loved as much as he loved me. I saw him cry for the first time that day. I'd seen him single-tear-rolls-down-the-cheek-cry but this was the first and only time I've seen him sob. I realized that he really does love me and I didn't want to be without him so I moved back in. Things were great for a few weeks we were very passionate and we have been more open with each other since then. After about another month, though, we were still very open with each other but the sex stopped again. Its been another two years of us being mostly happy but physically separate. I've started taking anti depressants and they have helped to kill my libido but I still crave human touch. I came back early today and heard him in the bathroom with what was quite obviously porn playing and so I just left again. I wouldn't mind him watching porn at all if it wasn't that or sex with me but it hurts to know that its not just a lack of desire on his part. It makes me feel like there is something wrong with me. I don't know what to do because it hurts to feel so undesirable but I don't want to live without him. He really is my purpose for staying alive. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks! TLDR: My boyfriend will watch porn but won't have sex with me and it freaking hurts."
65,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Cause Reddit is cheaper than therapy,2,bthxp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/bthxp0/cause_reddit_is_cheaper_than_therapy/,2019-05-27 15:04:36,"This will be my first post on Reddit so bear with me. First off, I have no idea that there were so many individuals experiencing similar emotions as well as being as lost as I am now. Second of all, this may end up being a lengthy post in which, I apologize in advance for. Well, with that being stated let's get this show on the road. &amp;#x200B; **Backstory:** I (24F) and my bf (26M) have had an interesting relationship, to say the least. We met back in 2014 off of Twitter of all things than bloomed into a friendship. The first time we decided to hang out, I walked into a whirlwind of drama. Long story short, he was in a relationship, living with her and her mother. She came home and saw that another girl (me), who was just hanging out with him while he was Dj'ing (nothing happened just be to clear ). Once all that occurred, he decided that from the moment he met me in person that he wanted to pursue a relationship with me, however, there were too many red flags for me to do that after just meeting this guy. I ended up helping him move his stuff out of his Ex's house cause I felt bad for the guy basically getting kicked out on the street cause I was just in the same space as him. Yet as I was helping him I saw his vulnerability and got to know him on a whole different level. I think the cause of this we connected on a deeper level of emotions. &amp;#x200B; Later down the road, He invites me to go out with him, his brother and his 2 girl coworkers. I declined due to having high anxiety and not wanting to be the 5th wheel. From this point on I basically ghosted him. A few months later, he starts dating his coworker that would have gone to the night he invited me to. Fast forward now to 2017, I moved to a different state, he was working between states, one of which was where I lived currently. He would hit me up to see if I wanted to hang out, I declined due to being in a relationship &amp; I know my feelings for him are deeper, that I didn't want to jeopardize anything in my relationship at the time. One night, He confesses his feeling for me &amp; I did the same over the phone but the following day I apologized for overstepping. &amp;#x200B; Months later, it's 2018 now &amp; I am visiting my home town, He wanted to see if I would hang out. At this time I felt that I had nothing to lose. We ended up hanging out, driving for 5+ hours just talking and catching up. I come to find out that his relationship that he pursue back in 2014 with his coworker abused him, cheated on him &amp; created basically PTSD. From that point on and still to this day, I have not forgiven myself for not going to that night to might have changed the outcome of his fate and this vile human. Anyways, I decided that I am at that point where I still have not had a connection with anyone else like I have had with him &amp; want to pursue those feelings we have for one another. 4 Months later, he moves states and moves in with me. Everything is great for a while, nothing too sexual ( intimate 2-3 times a month in the beginning) because you know, he was basically sexually abused and has trust issues. (or so I believe). I then one day come across his MULTIPLE Sex tapes with his ex &amp; the part that gets me is that it was not saved in just one place but multiple places. Flash drives, Hard drives, Mediafire, basically anything or anywhere you can save files. I straight up deleted all of it. Why keep memories like that from a person who traumatized you? Side note: His ex has been trying to contact him any way possible here and there by email, text, phone &amp; Facebook all with anonymous/fake accounts, yet he won't get a restraining order.... hmm? &amp;#x200B; At this time, my head is spinning thinking that I am not enough, that I will never be loved like he loved this abusive girl. That if I did not say no to that one night, that this would be so much different. We currently MAYBE are intimate once a month, which I think is out of his pity for me. I have tried everything possible to fix this, I have tried to be romantic, to be sexual, to be sweet, to initiate, to change my style, my appearance. Nothing works. I hate how much I love this man &amp; I know he literally moved hundreds of miles to be with me but, I don't see what I am doing wrong that his Ex was doing right, besides abusing him."

As carefully as I could, I expressed that (1) I wanted her, (2) I wanted her to want me, and (3) if that is not something she can offer, then I would just like to know so I can figure out how to cope. She countered that, for her, physical intimacy with me feels unnatural because she feels no emotional connection to me, and that she accepted long ago that this is the state of our marriage. I was quite surprised she felt this way, as I felt fine about our emotional bond and just thought that the lack of physical intimacy was due to other external factors. Nonetheless, I fully accept that emotional connection precedes physical intimacy, and I suggested several new things we could do to improve that, including: going on weekly dates, designated time every evening set aside to talk, and couples therapy. Her reaction was harsh, and I believe that was due to the suggestion of couples therapy. She would never admit this, but I believe she fears the vulnerability of talking to someone else about her past. There is trauma there, but she has been very successful in life by staying very busy. I know, I know, its not the right way to deal with trauma, but shes a wonderful person to everyone around her. However, when she works so hard and then I claim that theres something else she should be doing (e.g., physical intimacy), it really sets her off. Thats understandable to a degree, but I just worry that, under the surface, she is more miserable and less happy than she deserves. After some tense exchanges across a couple of days, she agreed that we should increase our 1-on-1 time (dates, etc.). She then showed me several books on intimacy that she had bought and she proposed a plan to be intimate regularly (3x per week for a couple of weeks). I was pleasantly surprised that she took so much initiative. Of course I am on board with everything that we are doing now, but I wonder if we are treating symptoms of a problem without adequately addressing the root cause. I am considering going to therapy (with her knowledge) even if she refuses. The therapist I spoke to briefly said it could still help me with my end of the relationship. I cannot force my wife to attend, but I question whether our present solutions will have a sustainable effect without addressing her past. Just to be clear: Neither divorce nor the threat of it is an option. I am happy in the marriage, and I wont end it simply because she makes herself miserable. However, I feel conflicted because just typing out that last sentence makes me feel like Im some kind of vampire. I dont have a question on which to end. Thank you in advance for your time and support. TL;DR: My LL wife is working with me on various ways to improve our emotional and physical intimacy, but she refuses couples counseling, which might be the only way to achieve sustainable happiness for both of us."
67,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,DB. Lost. Idk what to do.,1,buuh51,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/buuh51/db_lost_idk_what_to_do/,2019-05-31 01:23:47,"Forgive the inconsistency, rambling and grammatical errors... I'm trying to type this out on mobile and my head is spinning. I'll start with this: I love my wife so much. We've been together for five years: married for the last two. I love any and all forms of intimacy I have with her. If I'm awake and within proximity of her, I try to have some form of physical contact with her as often as possible: ranging from pecks on the cheeks and hand holding to cuddling. Still living at home with my parents and am desperately trying to change that (job apps/interviews like mad to relocate from CA to elsewhere atm). Now onto the actual DB stuff. When we first started being sexually active with each other we were constantly booking tickets to poundtown: going so far as her literally driving over to me for carsex then driving right back home. I've struggled with maintaining an erection since right after we've gotten engaged and she moved in with me. Convinced that it was from some sort of physical issue, sought help from a physician and ran all the tests that came to mind, then sought out second opinion from urologist. Was nothing wrong with the pipes. Was told it was from stress induced issues. Got a Viagra prescription, took a vacation: sex wasn't as great as before as long lapse made me finish faster but...hey any sex is better than no sex right? But then erection issues continued to plague me. Lots of tears from my wife, her questioning if I'm still attracted to her and my affirmations to try to convince her that I am. Afraid of hurting her and her fear of feeling rejected we made all sorts of excuses to forgo sexual intimacy: I'm so full, your parents might hear, it's really hot, etc. We swept it all under the rug figuring it was due to stress: I decided on a career change and started school to teach secondary level (high school) students, then changed work roles one semester in and pivoted away from school, all while planning for the wedding... So yes stress made sense. But that continued so erode away any and all forms of sexual intimacy we had as we just stopped initiating. We got married in June '18 and honeymooned in Greece for two weeks three months later in September. We had sex once and it was a Viagra aided sob fest. But we knew we loved each other even if we had to maybe just ignore the sex issues. Convinced it was from still living at home, I started job searching for a relocation opportunity to give us time and place to focus just on each other, isolated away from all issues that reoccurred from us living at home. The DB went into effect in full force as the waves of rejections from job apps flooded in. I couldn't remove my self worth from the application process and it chipped away at my confidence further. I relied on porn and masturbation for a form of sexual release and found that at least this way erection issues weren't a problem and I didn't have to crush my wife's self worth from my being unable to maintain an erection. Then just after February '19 some breakthroughs, the interviews start coming in and I stoke the hopes of us having OUR life together, there was still DB and but at least there was hope! Parents then took a trip in early May and we had the place to ourselves for two weeks. Wanting to be more adventurous, we went and got matching tattoos and enjoyed the feeling of ""our own space"". Thing were looking up! Promising job interviews were happening and hope was higher than before. Then a bombshell. My wife broke down in front of me and shared with me all the hurt and vulnerability she was feeling... We were alone for two weeks and I had hardly even touched her in a way to initiate. Did I not love her anymore? Was something wrong with her? Were we broken and asexual only two years into our marriage? After bawling together with her I told her I was sorry that she bore that all by herself and that j would try harder. She still felt betrayed and froze me out for a day, but warmed back up to me. My lovely, silly, beautiful, radiant wife was back in my life. Then this past Sunday, something happened that makes me fear we might be broken for good. After lazing about all day in bed while, cuddling a random semi chub cautiously poked out. In a random spurt of inspired mischief I placed my wife's hand on it, and for the next twenty or so minutes she constantly stroked and teased, basically maintaining the longest erection I've held in over two years with her. Feeling greedy but fearing any hurt, I asked her if we can try without a condom, as nearly any attempts a putting on a condom has killed my erection in more than a handful of our attempts (hence DB continued). She timidly nodded and we engaged in some a making out and heavy petting. I felt like I was finally making my wife feel wanted again. Then as soon as we get to PIV I lose my erection AGAIN. My wife just breaks down then freezes me out for the rest of the day and through Monday. I have an out of country business trip planned from 5/28 to 5/30 I leave for the trip without talking to my wife or without a single trace of warmth from her. I make it through most of the day on the 28th and she finally starts messaging me again. But all trace of warmth is gone. She questions if we're broken. And if I'm sexually attracted to other people, anyone, just not her. I tell her no. I tell her idk what's wrong with me, but that I truly love her with all of me. I love falling asleep next to her every night and to wake up next to her every morning. I'm so lucky to have her in my life. But the lack of sex convinces her that I no longer love her. My wife is still in contact with me, but the warmth, the joy, the love seems gone. I've tried to keep my messages consistent before this last breakdown. While my wife does reply to my queries, she does so without mirth. I've yet to hear or see her say the words ""I love you"" back to me. I feel like I'm drowning. I fly back tonight but by the time I'm home in our timezone it'll be past 10pm so I feel like I'm not going to get any sort of response then. I don't fucking know what to do."
68,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,"I am done trying to have constructive ""talks"" about how to understand her and improve intimacy...some people just won't engage in a positive way. Sorry super long.",48,bvcy4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/bvcy4h/i_am_done_trying_to_have_constructive_talks_about/,2019-06-01 07:09:31,"I will be going to therapy alone. I am hopeful but skeptical at the same time. I am going alone as my wife thinks I need to have someone help me with my ""problems"" What is my problem you ask? Wanting to have some degree of an intimate relationship with my wife. What do I consider intimacy with my wife beside making love? -Holding hands -Kisses (not pecks on check...lingering kisses) -Hugs -Cuddling -non sexual touches hand on knee, hand on back -Back rubs, shoulder rubs -hands around hips -etc These crazy suggestions is what set us off on a 7 mile what I call walk-fight. Where we fight as we walk for 7 miles trying to come to an understanding. What set off this fight you say? Me taking the advice of so many on this sub to talk with my wife in a calm, loving, boundary respecting manner about what I would like to see in our relationship intimacy wise and ask how I can help her understand why it is important to me and to ask why it is difficult for her and how I can help. It did not work. Colossal failure does not even begin to describe it. I believe we are now further apart than we were before having the talk in the way I describe above. I said can we talk. She grudgingly says sure and the walk-fight begins. Me: I really would like to try and work on our level of intimacy between us. Wife: Ugh. Me: ignores the ugh and continues I would like to do what I mentioned above more. Wife: You need to go to a therapist. Me: I am going to go I have contacted someone and will be going in two weeks when they have their first opening. Wife: Good you need to talk to someone so you can be happy. Me: I recognize I get moody and sad when we are not engaging in any sort of intimacy. I say I am not referring to just sex here but all the other things I listed above. Wife: See nothing is ever enough for you. Me: still staying calm &amp; measured. That is not what I am saying I know you are making big efforts and I appreciate it but I am not understanding the reluctance to hold hands, cuddle etc. I would like you to try and be patient with me like I am with you when I get a bit sad or grumpy because of lack of intimacy. Wife: See it is never enough for you. I have kids, the house, school, stress. I am giving you all I can. Me: I understand I am also maxed out. I am just trying to understand why holding hands, cuddles , kisses, is stressful for you. These are not time intensive activities. Wife: Never enough!!! We have sex 2 x times a week. Never enough. NOTE: we have tried to schedule sex. Usually ends up being 1x a week and it is duty sex to the extreme. Don't touch my breasts. Don't touch my pussy. Don't kiss me you know I don't like that. Quit nibbling my ear. No I am not getting on top. Are you almost done. Prolonged sighs. No I don't like to make noises or talk dirty. Only missionary or from behind. No post lovemaking cuddling. Up like a flash and in the shower. Me: Sensitive to the fact that I cannot bring any of of the note items up, say I recognize, appreciate, and honor that effort. I know it is not easy for you. I know you do not like it, I am just wondering why the other non lovemaking intimacy is so hard for you? Wife: I am not broken and I do not need to be fixed. I am happy with who I am. It is you who is not happy. You need to go to a therapist and get some coping mechanisms on how to deal with lack of intimacy. Me: Honey I believe we both need to go. We both have a part to play and our communication regarding this issue is going nowhere. That is how a therapist can help. DO you not think a therapist can help? Wife: They can help you. You need it. Me: You think you do not need it. You think WE do not need it. Wife: That's right I do not need it and I am not going. You need to go. I just want you to be happy. Note: THis is a new approach. I just want you to be happy. I have expressed that I too want to be happy. I too want US to be happy. Part of getting to happiness is understanding one another and our value of intimacy and how to navigate together. I feel like this is very manipulative. Part of how I derive some happiness is quality intimacy with my wife. Me: Ok so you are not going? Wife: No. Me: I think you are asexual, and aromantic with an aversion to sex. Note: In the past she says she thinks she may be aromantic. I explain what asexual means and she says ok yeah maybe I am Asexual and Aromanitc. Fights with me about being sex averse then agrees that she may be now and it is my fault. DId I have a part to play in her aversion. Likely yes. I did not figure out she was asexual till 3 months ago. In 22 year of marriage she has never expressed that she did not like sex or other intimacy. I had only heard about asexuality 3 months ago. So unwittingly my requests and albeit minimal pressure likely caused a aversion. Was I alone in this. No she has a part to play as well. Wife: I am done with this. I am who I am I am happy with who I am. You need to go get your problems sorted out. Me: By problems do you mean wanting an intimate relationship with you. When clearly you have some hangups with me wanting intimacy. I just want to understand how we can move forward. Wife: there you go saying I need to be fixed. Me: not fixed just how to come to a better understanding. Can you not allow yourself a little vulnerability. Note: This was the nuclear statement. Caught me totally off guard. Wife: I am done. I am happy with who I am. I have been vulnerable. I am done with this discussion. She looked like she was going to punch me in the face. She stewed on it all night and is even more mad today. In short I am fucked. The talk even coming from a place of calm, a place of we both are in this together, no accusatory statements. Owning my mistakes or missteps, none of it mattered with my wife. In short I am a no good lecherous sex demon who will not leave her alone. Don't you know you have problems...go get them fixed. How dare you try to suggest a therapist could help the BOTH of us communicate on this issue. Oh by the way go fix your problems. And full circle...my problem is I want to be more intimate with my wife. Intimacy being a mutual show of LOVE. Yep I am a real piece of work. Provide for my family of wife and kids, ensure kids and her have opportunities to do things they want. Decide I need to go to therapist and see how I can better understand my wife and communicate better on this issue. Other parts of the walk-fight also provided the following insights based off of things my wife said. -Kids are her priority. I am second string. That is just how it is at this stage of life she says...deal with it. -No way in hell will she go away with me for the weekend leaving the kids with a trusted friend. -I am selfish, and self absorbed emotional mess and why would she want to be intimate with me...waving her hand disgustedly in my direction. I have no idea what to do. But after last night the only positive is a lessening desire which dulls the pain associated with the lack of intimacy. If you got this far you are a kind soul indeed. Please be nice in the comments. Welcome frank honest polite feedback."
69,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,"Just a rant, for now.",14,bdwzm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/bdwzm3/just_a_rant_for_now/,2019-04-17 03:55:50,"Hi everyone, just sharing my experience from last night/this morning. I'm frustrated as hell and venting helps me keep on an even keel, so here goes. Normally the argument against any activity at night is the ""I'm really tired, I need rest for tomorrow"" line, which I do, really respect. We have 3 elementary school aged kids, and we both get up on the early side to prepare to work and child warfare. So the preferred time for shenanigans is the morning. Okay, understood. This morning, as per an agreement we made yesterday, I woke up a little ahead of our alarms to wake her up for a little Bob's your uncle before we get in the shower. She turns me away and says she has a bunch of things to do, its too close to the alarm, she hasnt showered yet, etc. I sigh that sigh that all of us can relate to and roll out of bed. Later on as we're in the kitchen, I'm feeding the kids breakfast and look over at her complaining about how late she is making herself, as she breaks out the hand mixer, the heavy whipping cream she asked me to pick up on the way home, and the vanilla extract, and proceeds to make whipped cream. From scratch. At 6 in the god damned morning. She laughs about her poor decision making but says it was all she could think about since yesterday and come hell or high water she was having some whipped cream for her coffee this morning. I laughed it off but in reality a chink of my armor fell off. To her its just a bowl of whipped cream, but in that moment I just couldnt drop the thought that she would rather make whipped cream, and be late doing it, then get up 10 minutes early and share herself with me. Like, you knew what you were doing this morning yesterday, when you called me on the way home to request the whipping cream. And given the choice of intimacy with your spouse, and a fucking hand mixer, you said ""Proctor-Silex baby... WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"". Am I being triggered over something stupid? I kinda explained my history in a previous post, where I have explained my feelings of rejection from her, my staying silent on those feelings, and the resentment that springs from believing what is important to me lives at the bottom of her to-do list. She told me during our version of the talk that she felt like I just showed her affection when I was horny, and in her defense, as our relationship went on through time, I have definitely gone cold on her in comparison to our early years. I have been more proactive in showing affection in public and in private, no strings attached. Which frankly, is just harder for me now - not because I don't care about her, in part because of my frustration/resentment issues, compounded by my relationship ""role models"" being my distant as fuck (and later divorced by way of adultery) parents. You have to operate with a level of vulnerability to do this affection thing well. She says she appreciates that I have been working on it, and my patience with her. I have read books, gone to a therapist a few times for my own issues regarding letting go of the past, but at this point I feel like I'm playing on a lopsided playing field. I need to proactively create an atmosphere that turns off the offs, and turns on the ons (as per Nagosky - and I read it before she did, damnit) and she gets to make whipped cream and appreciate my patient approach, and pull the ""its hard for me to feel comfortable when XXX, maybe if you'd XXX it would help me along"". Apologies if I'm being a ""in his feelings ass bitch"" on this, and I know that my bedroom is not as dead as others. We had sex a little over a week ago. But before that, it had been a month in a half where I just told myself I'd stop initiation altogether, but caved. I am tired of being patient with a person who does not seem to be acting in good faith, and I feel like I'm taken advantage of. Like all of the onus is on me to improve our relationship here, all she has to do is decide shes willing to have sex with me more than once a quarter. Later on she's going to tell a terrible joke about this and give me a sloppy wet kiss and mention something about making it up to me, before falling asleep on the couch when the kids go to bed I'm not ready to quit yet. But its days like this that test my resolve to come out of this as a stronger couple as opposed to co-parents. Blech, Sorry for droning."

I'm a vers bottom, he's a top. We've never had sex, but we've done sexual things with each other, but we've never had penetrative sex at all during our relationship. We've discussed our sexual history with each other, as sexually healthy adults should, and he has had SEX sex with other people. When we first started dating, he would get drunk and brag about the ""straight"" men he's slept with (I slept with the same, but dropped that in my mid-20's) and all the home-wrecking he used to do (his old roomie was gay, and his roomie's BF lived with them. My BF and his BF had an affair that lasted a long while, and went unnoticed for almost that entire duration). I harbor no judgments, cuz I've done my fair share of home wrecking when I was younger, it's life, and we learn from what we do. I even met an ex coworker of his who used to be his fuck-buddy, and he seems like a chill dude, but they're ancient history. However, every time I try to initiate even the smallest of sexual intimacy, he either shy's away, becomes irritable and crabby, or says he's ""uncomfortable."" I asked him if it was the way I was approaching him, or if I need to ask for consent differently, or maybe communicate my love language differently. He's says it's not me, it's him. This is even when we're taking a shower together and his bishop with a turtleneck seems kind of happy to see me. He always mentions that he ""doesn't know why it's this way"" with me, and said that he is, in fact, sexually attracted to me, yet, we haven't had any sort of sexual intimacy for many months now. I usually sleep in the nude, and he's noticed that I've started wearing things to bed instead of my birthday suit. When he confronted me about it, I told him I was tired of getting sexually aroused and just turned away. Each. And. Every. Time. He doesn't even like me kissing his stomach at all because he thinks he's too ""unattractive."" We had a recent talk about this, and I asked why he feels so ugly. He replied with ""Oh, know, I KNOW I'm attractive and hot, I just don't feel like that around you."" And, when I asked him why he felt like that, he shrugged and dismissed it with a ""Well, I dunno, you're my boyfriend. I just feel that way."" Recently, he sent me a nude selfie, the first he's ever sent me. He quickly deleted it in FB Messenger, and said he was ""embarrassed by it."" A couple days later, he was going down on me (the first intimate thing we've done in many months) and he suddenly stopped after a few minutes, said he ""just didn't want to"" and got up and started making food. A little later he comes back and profusely started apologizing for how rude he was acting. This is how it's been for the past half year or maybe more: he gets me riled up, stops, leaves, and comes back feeling bad, and says he'll be a better boyfriend. All of this with me not saying anything, just laying on the bed dumbfounded. This seems to be a constant thing with us. I crave intimacy with him, and he rejects it 90% of the time. I get sad about it, he asks why I'm sad, and I tell him. He either gets angry or sad about it, or sometimes just dismissive. I get that people have different libidos, sex-drives, and even some don't like penetrative sex, but this seems... different. He's currently not on any kind of medication whatsoever, so I know it's not that. I'm a dancer as my night job (that's where he met me), and I work out 3 to four days of three week, so it's not like I'm letting myself go or anything. I love my boyfriend, he's easily a solid 10/10 for me, but I'm just at a loss here. I've thought about approaching this with the idea of opening up the relationship, but I've been burned with that idea from some very shitty abusive exes, so it's not something I'm entirely comfortable with. We've had many talks about this, and how it's been killing my self esteem. I've stopped trying to initiate sexual intimacy because he rejects it so often, and it hurts my feelings with how he goes about it, and with how often it happens. And when it does happen, I feel like I'm just masturbating to him and he's waiting go it to be done. I love this human, so ever fucking much, but this is a hurdle we keep communicating about, especially his issues with vulnerability."
71,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,HL spouse and I have been living apart for 3 weeks. This is the email Im sending him. Feedback?,12,bm8jeb,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/bm8jeb/hl_spouse_and_i_have_been_living_apart_for_3/,2019-05-09 04:02:23,"Like the title says - and my post history explains - my HLM spouse and I(LLF) have been living apart for three weeks. He said in February he wanted a divorce and its been a shit show since then. Were supposed to talk after his finals wrap up and I havent heard from him, but wanted to send this to explain my side. Any feedback would be appreciated. Im not expecting to necessarily change his mind - just explain whats going on in my head. He asked for some time to see where this thoughts go with some space. Spouse, I hope the end of your semester went well. I'm confident you did well and passed your exams - congrats on finishing your second year of school! Also sorry if it was weird that your mom got Mother's Day gifts from me - they were things I'd ordered previously and forgot about. Lucy's poo is mostly normal - no more dark blood - but she is still hiding quite often. I wanted to send you an update on where I am since moving out - we were supposed to talk at some point after your classes ended and I'm not sure how to go about that. Since moving out, I feel like a different person. The space we've had over the last few weeks has given me a lot of clarity and time to heal from the past few months. I needed it. I think we both did. I've been doing a lot of reading about a lot of things - boundaries, vulnerability, etc. Things that I struggled with a lot. I've been doing a lot of journaling, have continued to go to therapy, and even started seeing a sex therapist in addition to my normal counselor. It's been really helpful and eye-opening. I'm actively addressing my issues and hang ups about sex and physical intimacy and have been making a lot of progress mentally. Like I said, none of my issues regarding physical touch or sex were about you. Again, I apologize wholeheartedly for the hurt I caused in rejecting you. I know that it has hurt you irreparably and I'm sorry for that. They were always my issues and I was unable to verbalize what I was feeling. I've realized that a lot of things I find appealing or arousing were things I wasn't able to verbally say due to shame and embarrassment. I had tried to make some progress when I bought those sex toys and your reaction made me feel like an idiot. I know that wasn't your intent and I didn't say anything, but I felt shamed. Of course we then used those things and it was fun and exciting so that feeling was unfounded, but I didn't realize I felt that way until I started talking about it. There were so many times I wanted to initiate sex or cuddling or any kind of physical touch and my anxiety wouldn't let me. I couldn't turn my brain off enough to just jump in. After reading Come As You Are, another book about stress by the same author, and working with a sex therapist, I feel like I've made a lot of progress. I had so much fear about doing something wrong or looking stupid - I was afraid to be vulnerable. I've read two books by Brene Brown - a social worker from Houston who is clearly my new idol - about the power of vulnerability and it's been life changing. Throughout all of this - especially since moving - I've had such an awakening of passion and desire - not just for sex - but for everything. I think the discussion about divorce and the conversations we had after that were the ""straw that broke the camel's back"" and years of pent up vulnerability came pouring out. Like you said, you hadn't seen me cry that much in our whole marriage. I hid a lot of that because you were also so complementary of me being ""low maintenance"" and I internalized a lot of that. Being strong meant that I also shut down a lot of my feelings about everything and it carried over into physical and emotional intimacy. This isn't to blame you, but just explaining what I've learned in therapy. I never judged you for initiating sex at night. Sure I was frustrated because I'm not pleasant when woken up, but I never felt it was crossing any lines. I never felt weird about watching porn in Vegas - it was exciting and fun until it got weird and incestuous :) We did a shit job of communicating our needs to each other. I regret that. When we had time to ourselves - without the pets - I feel like we were unstoppable and so connected. I miss those days. I realize no one can live for a week of vacation - that the day-to-day needs to have some excitement too. Since moving out, I'm working on crating the dogs at night to sleep. I let WAY too much slide with the pets at the expense of our relationship. I own that problem and I'm sorry that it hurt you. I wish that we had had a real discussion about that. I depended a lot on you - especially since moving to Texas - for social outlets. I felt like our time in San Marcos was better - things were new and exciting. My job got to be a lot more stressful than I anticipated and my fear about you leaving on rotations, having to start another new job, move again, etc. got to me and I withdrew. Dealing with death and dying everyday was a lot more difficult than I realized at the time. You really have to numb yourself to it and that numbness carried over into my personal life, which isn't okay. I'm sorry I shut you out. Starting over at another new job, knowing it was temporary, was really hard for me. I saw you struggling with classes and studying and didn't want to burden you further. That was a mistake - I should have shared how I was feeling. In the books I've read and therapy I've done I'm learning how to be vulnerable - how to name and share emotions and feel okay about opening myself up to other people. I've reinvested in my friendships with Friend and Friend. We talk a lot more often and it's been very helpful. I'm realizing more and more that I really lost myself in our marriage - I threw myself into your dreams and goals 100% - even at an expense to myself. Your dream was our dream and I forgot to put myself on the priority list. I've been able to do that now. I'm talking with my sister more than I have in a long time and realizing a lot of my judgment was unfair. She is struggling and hurting and I should have been more understanding. I'm doing that now. I never equated you with my sister or the people I work with and complained about. I'm sorry that you felt that way and hope that I didn't contribute to that. Like I told you the last few times we talked before I moved, I have established better boundaries at work. I'm consistently leaving at or before 5pm and have stopped taking on responsibilities that aren't mine. I've been reading a book called Boundaries that's been so helpful. I'm realizing it's not my job to do everything for everyone - including you. That was a mistake I made especially since being here in Texas. I haven't found a second job, I don't do the transcription/typing anymore either. I'm learning to enjoy slow Saturday and Sunday mornings - reading and lazying around with the dogs. I miss having you there. The dogs miss you too. I'm learning it's okay to not always be busy. I've realized I stayed so busy because I was afraid of just being - just enjoying a quiet moment. I felt like I always had to be doing something since you were so busy with school and studying - that me just lazing around wasn't good and I needed to occupy and entertain myself so you wouldn't feel like you had to pull away from studying. I've had a lot of those quiet moments lately and it's been a learning process, but it's been refreshing to not feel like my to-do list is never ending. I've joined two book clubs, a bowling league, and have started the training process to volunteer at Austin Animal Center. I'm putting myself out there more to rediscover things that I like. Like I said, I spent so much of the last two years feeling like ""your wife"" and not me. I'm rediscovering things that I enjoy and am passionate about. It's been hard to not talk to you about big things - Notre Dame burning down, the Mueller report, the BYU valedictorian coming out during his commencement speech (!!!). Apparently there's also been a change to the church policy about civil vs temple marriages, but I haven't looked into it yet. I've also realized that living with our roommate - and her boyfriend - was really hard for me. Our roommate is intimidating and driven and I'm realizing kind of bad for my self-esteem. She's a machine and will do incredible things, but it was hard for me to not feel like a total shit around her. Being in my own space has reminded me that I'm enough just as I am. While there's always room for improvement - and I've been doing a lot of that - I don't have to compare myself to other people. Living with two other people for four months was really hard on me. I've also realized I was so easily influenced by other people's emotions - when Co-worker at work is upset, it's hard for me not to be upset. When Roommate was frustrated, it was hard for me not to be. That's not okay. I'm working in therapy to address that and feel I've made good progress. I feel a lot healthier and more in control of my emotions. I've been getting my steps, going to the gym, and eating well. I got in a really dark place after you said you wanted to divorce and while I haven't gained any weight back I'm working to make sure I'm taking care of myself for myself. I colored my hair over the weekend for the first time in years because I wanted to. It was something that I wanted to do just for me and it felt really good to do that. Again, that's something I didn't do in the last few years - everything was so focused on what you wanted - a new jacket for your Utah rotations, or shoes, or whatever - I sacrificed everything I wanted so you could have what you wanted and needed. That wasn't okay. I hoarded vacation time and burnt myself out so that I'd have time to see you between California and Utah and spend a few days with you before you left in August. I've really been focusing on taking care of myself as best as I can - something I haven't done in awhile. I'm feeling a lot better, but it's still hard. I've started the process to take some nursing pre-reqs in the summer and fall. I may need some help with the dogs on Tuesdays as I will potentially have A&amp;P until 10pm those nights. Maybe you'll be able to let them out? If not, maybe we can discuss sharing the cost of a dog walker or something. But I'm excited about going back to school. If I get my pre-reqs done in time, I could start an advanced BSN program in May. It's kind of terrifying but also exciting. I got very depressed - especially moving to Round Rock - as we both know neither of us are suburb people. San Marcos was fun because there was stuff to do but it felt a lot like our time in Round Rock was just shit. Driving into Austin wasn't feasible every day, my work stress overwhelmed me, and I was unhappy with living where we did. I was frustrated that you had half days and late starts and didn't seem, to me, to understand the burden I'd been carrying as the financial support of us for the last two years, and the toll that took. I wanted us to be able to go out and do things, but also realized we needed money to pay bills and allow you to go on the rotations you wanted and possibly buy a new car before you graduated. If I hadn't done that stuff, I wouldn't have been able to pay the fee to break the lease. Since getting out into my own place, I've had space to reflect on my stress levels, shutting down with depression, and feeling pulled to give you everything you wanted while maintaining some financial security. I didn't handle that well and I took it out on you. That was unfair and wrong of me. I don't know what else to say except I'm incredibly sorry. I know that that likely contributed to your feelings of depression, inadequacy, etc. and I regret that I contributed to that. I was upset that I had to move twice to places I didn't want to go in pursuit of your dream. I didn't feel like my sacrifices were recognized and that the two jobs I was working weren't seen as a contribution to furthering your dream. We should have talked more about that - even if it meant yelling. I felt like we couldn't do that because we lived with Torey. I felt like I had to keep a lot in because someone else was around. We fought more in Nashville because I felt ""safer"" doing it at home. To help with my anxiety and depression I've deleted most social media. I've stopped comparing myself to other people and spending time mindlessly scrolling a news feed. Like I said, a lot of my insecurities about physical touch were also related to my body image. Since I don't spend so much time looking at other people's highlight reels I've felt a lot calmer, less anxious, and just generally happier. I feel like us having our own space will likely be helpful for both of us. I know it's been helpful for me. I'm sorry you've had to stay in the house - it was literal hell for me to be there. I hope getting into your new place will be a reprieve for you. While it hasn't been that long, I don't feel like the same person I was for the last year. I feel lighter, happier, and like I'm getting back to being myself - the person I was when we were dating and first got married. I've looked back a lot at how much I've sacrificed for you and this marriage - we got married on your timeline, I moved to Clarksville and commuted, then back to Nashville, I missed my master's graduation so we could move based on your needs, moving to San Marcos and then Round Rock and the jobs I had - again all for your dream. While I never regretted any of it - I was happy to support and be your partner - I don't feel like I was really supported or recognized for the work I was doing too. I always said I never wanted you to feel tied down by being married - I wanted you to have the experience of studying abroad, traveling, experiencing everything - even if it meant I couldn't go too. It broke my heart to not be able to go to Big Bend and New Orleans - but the responsibilities of bills and the dogs and starting a new job with no PTO meant I had to make a sacrifice of time with you. Again, I don't regret it, but I'm sad that I feel/felt it wasn't recognized as necessary. I feel like the relationship we had - especially this last year - is dead. I haven't known where you are or who you're with in months. You mentioned that the trust has been broken and I don't disagree, however, at this point, it feels like we aren't even really connected anymore. In all the discussions we've had since you said you wanted to divorce, I feel my position hasn't changed. I am always willing to build a new house and a new relationship with you. You are the person I want to build a life with - this marriage was never a box to check. I married you because I wanted to build a life with you. I followed you halfway across the country because I love you and believe in you. While things have been shit for the last year or so, I truly believe that you and I connect on so many levels and have the potential to be something incredible. Who else is going to call out the missionaries in Brigham Young's house and secretly love you name dropping Sam Young at your brother's hovel house? All of this is to say, I don't feel my position has changed. I respect and understand your need for space and to feel independent. I want you to have all of that. I understand you need to finish school. What I don't understand is that in our last counseling session you said that you felt things between us could be fixed, you just weren't sure if you wanted to do that. That was really hard for me to hear because prior to that, you had said if it was determined things could be fixed, you'd commit to it. While I wasn't great at showing it, this marriage and you are the most important thing in my life. You are my partner, despite the shit time it's been these last three months and the year preceding it. I'm frustrated and hurt that it took a month for you to invest in someone else and decide that you wanted to end our marriage. I'm hurt and angry that you essentially wanted to leave me for someone else. That shit was really painful. I've worked through a lot of that hurt through therapy, journaling, and investing in myself to be and do better. I view that investment in someone else as a symptom of a larger problem in our marriage. While the way I found out about everything was hurtful and shitty, I see it all as a symptom of our lack of communication. I hate that I didn't see the signs of your mental health deteriorating. I hope that counseling has been helpful for you and that you're feeling better and stronger. You are an incredible person and I hope that you know that. If you've made it this far, I applaud you. This turned into a novel I never intended to write. Since you said you wanted to divorce, I feel like I've continued to sacrifice and put you first. I paid rent, gave you the money to break the lease, paid bills when necessary, made sure you could get your teeth cleaned, get glasses, contacts, and mental health counseling. Even in your wish to leave me, I continued to put you first. In reading Boundaries, I realized this isn't okay. I did those things because I love you and want you to succeed, but it's not my responsibility to ""save"" you. You wanting to pay me after you graduate is still asking me to put you first. I can no longer continue to do that. If you can't or won't or don't want to try and carve out something new, I respect and understand that. I spent most of our marriage putting your needs, wants, and goals first and if this chapter of my life is ending, I can't continue to put you first. I need to concern myself only with things that are good and positive for me. For me, that means if you want to continue with getting divorced, I will get an attorney and ask for what I'm owed under the law - the car to be sold, my credit card debt to be paid, and us to split anything remaining. I realize that will negatively impact you, but I cannot continue to put you first. I haven't contributed to a retirement account in two years because I couldn't afford it while supporting both of us, but I was okay with it because there was a promise that we were a team and once you got a job, I could catch up with contributions. I will no longer have that if we get divorced. If you're open to the possibility of building something new over the summer or when you get back from rotations, then things would look a lot different. I think seeing each other once or twice a week would be ideal. It'd give us time to build something new slowly and see if it's workable. Obviously there's no guarantee it'd be successful, but as I've said, I'm always open to trying to build something new. I am asking for an opportunity to show you how much I've changed and to show you that in a way that's meaningful to you. I miss when we were dating and played Words with Friends - I remember specifically being in my office at the Cayce clinic and you played the work proselytize and I feel like at that moment I knew you were my person - no one but the Mo's use that word and even thinking about it now I'm smiling. I'm open to hearing what your thoughts are on this novel. I want to continue to respect your need for space and time to reflect on what you want for your life. I hope the time you've had has been helpful, regardless of the outcome. I'll continue to wait until you're ready to talk about where you're at, however, I can't wait forever. If I don't hear from you by May 15th, I'll assume we're moving forward with the divorce and will need your new address to have my attorney contact you. I have signed the waiver of service and it's ready for you to pick up whenever you'd like. I hope to hear from you soon. Always, Allinthejourney"
72,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,"Resources for the male LL, please?",11,azqzzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/azqzzu/resources_for_the_male_ll_please/,2019-03-11 19:38:07,"Hey guys. I'm looking for TED talks or videos (specifically not text) to give the male LL. He's already seen ""The power of vulnerability"", ""The secret to desire in a long-term relationship"" by Esther Perel and Maureen McGrath's ""No sex marriage"". He had some questions afterwards which I perceived to be a positive outcome. As usual, I don't know if it will stick. We've had a three-way session with his psychiatrist, who also happens to be a therapist, and well some things were said. We're both very aware that the relationship is hanging by a thread. Some things happened after the session, those things I am very ashamed of and I'm not sure if I can write them, not now. After the incident, I got very angry instead of very sad and I guess something clicked in him. It clicked in me too. It's one of those events that either break the relationship in pieces and both parties move on or it grows stronger than steel - time will show. Anyways, do you guys have any suggestions for resources? EDIT: Also, I remember one or two long-term members had widely recommended posts. I'm sorry I can't remember their nicknames, but if you have any idea what I'm talking about, any hints or comments are welcome. :) A very bittersweet cheers to everybody!"
73,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Esther Perel Podcast,212,b0e58x,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/b0e58x/esther_perel_podcast/,2019-03-13 09:35:03,"I haven't seen it mentioned here, but Esther Perel, the ""Mating in Captivity"" lady, has a podcast - it's between its second and third season at present. It's called ""Where Should We Begin?"" and each episode is a single counselling session with a couple in her practice. She tackles a variety of marital issues, but has quite a few DB/sexually dysfunctional marriages in the show, with a variety of backgrounds and causes (standard ""had kids and sex died"", also trauma, ED, subconscious negative views on sex/marriage, etc.) I haven't listened to every episode yet, but I've listened to several while I work for the last few days. For those of y'all who podcast, I recommend checking this one out. For all the horror stories we read here about couples counseling, her sessions feel like marital therapy done right. Things that jumped out at me: 1) There is no ""blame game"" going on in her sessions. With the couples and with her, the sessions feel surprisingly... conversational? It's not her telling people they're right or wrong or unreasonable or whatever. She's not refereeing or assigning points to one side or the other. And for most part the couples themselves also avoid doing that. Each person talks about their own emotional landscape, perceptions, issues, etc., and she engages that and tells that individual and their partner ways to work with that landscape, as opposed to fighting it. The sessions aren't about changing who anyone *is* - just giving better tools or perspectives to adapt themselves and reduce conflict in their relationship, while standing a better chance at getting their own needs met. 2) While it's clear a lot of the couples are upset, frustrated, have been dealing with these issues for awhile, there is a marked lack of hostility or contempt between them. Again, the tone is mostly quite conversational. In each episode I've listened to so far, even the high-conflict ""these guys can barely go two sentences without arguing"" couple, everyone involved is showing up and willing to make changes to improve their relationships. Everyone is willing to own things they've said and done that have contributed to the problems, ways they've acted that they regret later. No one is playing innocent or just pointing the finger at their partner, no matter how hurt or frustrated they are. With regards to dead bedrooms specifically, there have been a few nuggets of wisdom: 1) She seems to take a rather dim view on ""duty sex"". Per her ""accelerator and brakes"" theory from her book, she seems to mainly tackle, on the LL side of the equation, getting them in touch with their own desires and addressing the things that inhibit them. In the one episode I listened to where ""doing it for him"" came up, she discouraged the idea, saying it wouldn't solve the core problems and it wouldn't give the HL partner what they actually wanted. 2) Remarkably, she hasn't, or hasn't needed to, explain the importance of sex within marriage so far (though she did go a little hard on one particular LL who had some serious hang-ups about ""sex-within-marriage"" specifically). All parties in those sessions understand that... just having a sexless marriage is no good. For the LLs in these scenarios, it's more learning how to get around their own mental blocks (and ways the HLs might be inadvertently getting in the way or making things worse). 3) She encouraged one HL to let go of the idea of a ""set frequency"" - the ""how often, should we be doing it X times a week"" ideas. She asked that HL what they actually wanted from their sex life - desire, energy, excitement, etc. - and that the ""number"" was beside the point. The number will inevitably go up and down, especially with kids in the mix. Some weeks, months, etc, will be better than others. 4) Fear of rejection (actually on both the HL and LL sides, in different ways), as well as fear of vulnerability, and struggles to speak up for what they wanted, have been recurring themes so far. It seems several of the LLs had internalized at some point that they had to be entirely giving in bed or ""do"" sex a certain way for their partners, that it was ""selfish"" in some way or another to actually ask for (or even take) what they themselves wanted. Thus, sex naturally became more difficult and unfulfilling for them over time (this generally isn't a conscious progression, it's something that Perel points out and the LL goes ""Oh!"") On the other side of the coin, in some cases the HL was creating a double-bind for the LL by not clearly articulating what they wanted. So the LL was either avoidant, or wouldn't fully realize what was wrong, or would try but do the wrong thing, or the HL would actually ask for something specific that the LL was willing to do, but it was ""ruined"" because they'd had to ask. For all sides of the equation, a recurring theme was to actually *ask* for what you want. 5) Every single LL had a sexuality of some kind, though in some cases it took some real digging to unearth it, especially for a couple of LLFs who had internalized some rather sex-negative messages. But every single one she spoke do did, somewhere in there, have things that felt good, had fantasies, etc. It was a matter of finding them, removing whatever was going on to inhibit them, and feeling safe enough with their partner to express those things. Apologies if this has become super-long. Just a lot of good bits of info in there that I wanted to share with this crowd. Obviously I'm finding the podcast pretty interesting so far (that one high-conflict couple reminded me so much of myself and my ex that I damn near cried and work, and I would almost send that episode to him if I thought it would make a damn bit of difference). But it demystifies couples counselling while also doling out a lot of solid advice. I listen on Stitcher - which, notably, doesn't display history if that's a concern. But I'm guessing it's available elsewhere too. "
74,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,"Wife thinks shes superwoman, doesnt need me for anything, including sex",86,b722kq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/b722kq/wife_thinks_shes_superwoman_doesnt_need_me_for/,2019-03-30 07:11:13,"Hello all, Ive been lurking for months and finally decided to post. Im at a loss. My wife and I have been married for three years. No children due to her infertility issues. I sometimes wish I could be a dad, but I knew that she was unable to conceive before we got serious and I told her that it wasnt an issue. Its not something we discuss now but I think shes sadder about this than she lets on. I dont know the depth of her feelings; she refuses to let me in. This is the crux of my issue with her. Shes like an impenetrable (sexually and emotionally!) fortress and I cant figure out a way to get in. For some background: She is 30, Im 37. We dated for about two years before getting married. Sex was frequent in the beginning. She isnt all that kinky, never has been as far as I can tell. Given my druthers we would experiment a lot more with bondage, S/m, etc, but shes expressed discomfort with any sort of play that puts her in a submissive role. I think part of this is due to her job. She works as a victim advocate in affiliation with law enforcement. Shes AMAZING at her job, but I know that it really gets to her sometimes. Shes worked with many women who were victims of violent sexual crimes and its ruined her opinion of darker sexual play. I can respect that, although I wish she was more openminded. Shes always enjoyed masturbation but she doesnt often want me to join in. Its something that she does for herself, especially when she cant sleep. Ive told her repeatedly that if she needs to cum in order to sleep, let me know. She never takes me up on it. I believe that her job is a huge factor in our dead bedroom. Not only does it affect her view of non-standard sex, but the terrible things she deals with worm their way into her head and mess with her. In the early days she would vent to me a little. Nothing detailed, she would just say that the current case was stressful/sad/difficult and would let me know where her head was at. She doesnt do that now. When she has a bad day Ill know because shell be terse and walled off. Eventually, either a few hours or a few days later, she sorts herself out again and shes back to her sunny, totally self-sufficient self. Its like being married to a stepford wife. She never asks for help with anything. Car needs repairing? She calls the mechanic, arranges a temporary car, tells me about it only in the context of My car needs X, estimate is Y, think the bill account can handle that?. She notices a loose tile on the floor, she either figures out how to fix it herself or she calls a handyman. I never know anything is wrong until after the fact. She runs around like a chicken with its head cut off, always handling every little thing with zero complaint. She goes to bed after me, gets up before. She never relaxes. She never lets her guard down. We havent had sex with any regularity in two years. I feel like a eunuch. Heres my outstanding, accomplished, gorgeous wife, running the show while working a stressful job, and Im the dopey husband plodding along. Everyone loves her. My family adores her, her family adores her. And who wouldnt? Shes great. But she wont show any vulnerability. Its like shes scared to let anyone in. Ive heard her crying in the shower several times, but if I come into the bathroom she stops and tells me that shes fine. Ive tried to hold her, to ask how shes doing, and I get rebuffed every time. I dont know what to do. Ive asked her to talk, she wont go in depth about how shes feeling. Ive asked for therapy, she scoffs (which is rich, considering that she knows the important of therapy and sees how vital it is in her work). Ive asked her to please slow down, to consider time off from work or to drop the extra activities that suck up so much of her time. It wont kill her or anyone else if she doesnt participate in the book club and doesnt bake five million things for the relay for life bake sale. Ive stressed that she doesnt have to be perfect. She doesnt have to have it all togehher. She ignores me. What do I do? Do I put my foot down and demand more sex and attention? Do I tell her how unnecessary I feel? How do you tell someone who looks so perfect on paper that shes killing her marriage? "

It has come to the point where I consider this a really stable process, upwards and onwards. Told my husband (not ""asked him"") to get into the bathroom while I was showing. No sex, but some great physical contact, playful, sexy, a nice moment and good enough for me (HLF) right now. That would have been unthinkable only a few months ago. &amp;#x200B; Yesterday we went to an event together. It turned into a full blown date, as if we had only just met. The way you sit at a table opposite each other and talk, during the drink before, slightly tense, trying to look cool but not too obvious, be interesting, make compliments, flirting but not throwing yourself at each other... A lot of ""distance"", a lot of ""two individuals meeting"" and not a couple of a decade sitting there and expecting nothing new or exciting to come from that person. I told him recently that, since people evolve constantly, the familiarity can never become fully predictable, and that in my opinion there is no such thing as knowing a person 100%. There will always, ALWAYS be something new to discover, emotionally, sexually, intellectually. In that sense, I said, I believed also that sex can become better over the time, as long as one meets the other as a person one is truly interested in and wants to discover and rediscover over and over, and go with the flow instead of with the moves that worked before. That seemed to interest him greatly. He looked at me and said: That is so true, we can't really know someone 100%, there may be so much more to discover. &amp;#x200B; The event was a show that took place with the lights almost completely out. Lots of great music, great atmosphere. I put my hand on his knee. He allowed it. I caress it. He allowed it. Then he stretched his hand out to hold mine. That hasn't happened in a very long time, we're talking years, and so we sit there holding hands without letting go for several hours. &amp;#x200B; We walk home through the streets hand in hand. We part (because I had to go somewhere else afterwards), and now I am alone with all these feelings and thoughts. &amp;#x200B; Strangely, I was hit by a depression that I would not have expected. This day has been brutal. Yesterday I just felt angry, for now apparent reason, and today I felt so depressed I could hardly move. What the hell is this...? Is it that it takes all sooo increeedibly looong until we are going to have proper sex again...? Is it that I just need a physical outlet, just need to lay in his arms naked, listening to my heartbeat calming down, and it's still not (yet) happening...? Or is it that my mind allows for the pain of the past to come up because now it gets better...? &amp;#x200B; We haven't had any backwards movements now for an entire year. It is as if the tiny little parts of a huge, rusty machinery are broken apart, bit by bit, before they can get cleaned, oiled and put together again. &amp;#x200B; I feel happy, and I feel lost. I don't feel weepy depressed, just numb and lethargic and without any enthusiasm depressed. A comfort: our increased vulnerability towards each other. The emotional intimacy is at the root of our recovery. I called him at work telling him I felt depressed. He asks if I have eaten something, and if not, to do so, and then get some fresh air. I do all of the above and tell him afterwards. He is happy he could help me. I still feel depressed, but that was a nice moment of him being there for me. &amp;#x200B; Aaah, these emotions. Why...??? Why the anger and the depression - I think it is because we are so close, and yet so far. &amp;#x200B; Hope so much you are all doing alright, take care and have a nice remaining day."
77,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Its more hurtful to be lied to again and again than it is to catch him in the act,11,as274j,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/as274j/its_more_hurtful_to_be_lied_to_again_and_again/,2019-02-19 08:17:48,"Ive been in a relationship with this man that I adore and love for two years. We struggle with intimacy, which stems from his lack of vulnerability. I am and have always been a huge communicator, and Ive been through counseling for two years now because of my traumatic childhood/teenage years. Getting in a relationship and staying in one is a first for me and Ive adored getting to do this with my boyfriend, because were very similar and have become best friends. Ive been accepting of our lack of intimacy because every other part of our relationship has been so great. A year in, I found out that he had been raped as a child by a family member for a span of time. It broke my heart to find this out. The only reason he told me is because I was becoming increasingly more paranoid that he wasnt being honest with me, because he never wanted to have sex and when we did, he couldnt finish. I was convinced that he wasnt attracted to me, he was cheating, or he was gay, so he finally told me the truth. After that, I never pushed sex but advised counseling for him or us and offered to go with him. He said no, he just needs to work out and start getting more in shape to boost his testosterone. I didnt want to push him and told him I loved him no matter what. Well after a year longer, he would inconsistently want to have sex here and there, which I never turned down. Im not going to lie, I have lost a lot of confidence being with him and often feel very unattractive/not sexy or just that a piece of me is missing because I crave to be vulnerable and intimate with him so badly. I never bring up my feelings because Ive been told so many times that Im making him feel pushed, or Im making him feel like he HAS TO and that makes me feel like Im a rapist so I obviously feel like I cant talk about it. Well today, I came home at a different hour than normal and I hear shuffling in the sheets and hes acting extremely weird. Totally out of character for me but I yanked the covers up and see that his phone screen has the audio that was playing (which was some porn video) and I said, are you masturbating?? And hes like no, I was sleeping. And I just became so filled with rage and then immediately hurt and so upset. I could care less that he was watching porn, but what I care about is that he cant be honest and tell me that he watches porn when I ask or tell me how he feels about our sex lives when I ask him directly and tell him that I want that part of our relationship back. I get his feelings of not feeling confident and not feeling manly, I love him regardless. But if hes not willing to get help, but is going to continue watching porn and finding his fix through video games and running from his problems, then WHY am I sitting here waiting for him to want me the way I desperately want to be wanted??? He felt so bad and kept apologizing and I just had to leave to collect my thoughts. I dont feel angry with him but more so hurt that Ive been lied to and made to feel crazy for nearly two years when he really has been doing everything I was asking him about!!!"

Not just physically, but emotionally too. We have been best friends, but in a way, only surface level. We have done everything together, from visiting his grandpa at the nursing home every Sunday, living together, having game nights with our families and being each others partner's to events. We both come from homes where feelings and thoughts are ""weird"" and ""not okay"". We both have also had really traumatic childhoods, so although we both love each other and don't want to live life without each other, we do don't know how to communicate or be ""vulnerable"". It's terrifying. Two years ago, I decided to get therapy and work through this stuff. I started going to a recovery program for trauma and I have made a lot of progress. I've changed my job to something with a more positive and healthy atmosphere and I've disconnected from anyone and everyone that was keeping me down. My boyfriend is still in that place and that's okay. It wasn't long ago that I was there too and so I know that it takes time to come to a place that you're willing to get help and find yourself. The thing that I'm realizing is that I'm very codependent and I feel that I would literally be lost without him. It's a long story short, but recently I reached this point of NEEDING this intimacy so badly from our relationship, something I haven't been getting in a long time. I've been doing all of these things to learn how to set boundaries, learning how to love him and be there for him, but also how to not get sucked back in to that place that I was before because it was even more empty and dark. I finally voiced that I would really appreciate if he considered getting help, even if it's couple's counseling not because anything is fucked up in his head or because he's messed up, but because we both deserve to overcome our past and experience vulnerability and love to the fullest capacity. But if we don't do anything, or if we both continue to let our depression take over our lives, we will never get better. It feels like for the first time, I am fighting with all my might for myself and for my relationship. I have never attached to someone before and I'm so scared. He said YES to couple's therapy. This makes me over the moon excited, yet at the same time, I feel so afraid to let my guard completely down and let him see the ugly parts of me that I've never shown anyone. I know he's afraid too. So this really is one of the most beautifully difficult things I have ever done, so I will face my fear because the pain finally outweighs my fears. I'm hopeful that maybe this emptiness and void of intimacy will finally go away. We have both never experienced that connection before, not with anyone including our parents, and I crave it so badly and it just means so much that he's willing to work on this with me."
79,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Life after a DB: Scars don't go away; How to do right by new love interest?,5,axdchr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/axdchr/life_after_a_db_scars_dont_go_away_how_to_do/,2019-03-05 09:29:30,"I'm relatively recently out of a DB marriage of 15 years (with a kid). My life was better the second I left, for those of you on the fence. I very quickly found this great new person who I've been dating 4 months now, and I'm already in love. Compassionate, understanding, funny, sexy. I'll say it. In. Love. Our relationship has been \*great\*. Wait for it ... BUT the last few weeks, my new love interest has been feeling the drain of the last couple months of FT school and FT work and PT internship (all in an emotionally-demanding field), and our romantic/sex life has taken a big hit. We saw each other when we could and had pretty damn frequent sex during Christmas break, and it's been intimate and passionate and fulfilling throughout. We date when we can and try to make time for intimacy and romance, but I can see a lot of physical and emotional exhaustion most of the time, and hot-heavy-and-often is now much more cool-easy-and-much-less. I'm very proud of the work that my sweetheart does and very excited to be a part of their life changes, even though right now they present us a challenge. At the same time, the scars from my marriage are hardly completely healed, and the flagging frequency and intensity of sex in my \*current\* relationship just last night stirred up a crap ton of the feelings of inadequacy and vulnerability from the years and years of rejection and dismissal by my ex. At least my sweetheart notices and cares though. Where my ex treated my 'needs' like demands, my new interest understands what is standing in the way of what we both want in the relationship and demonstrates a desire for change. I don't know how it could all that much until the semester is over, but what's two months stretched thin, when I've gone nearly 15 without it altogether. Nevertheless, internally, again I feel undesirable, unwanted. All those feelings of inadequacy, jealousy, doubt just flood back. I mean flood. All the awkward trepidation, the halted touches, the half-way start-just-to-stop pseudo-passion. The silence. The fear. It's all so well-practiced. I don't want to make anyone accountable for my ex's dishonesty or my struggles over intimacy. Neither do I want to make the same mistakes I made before. Can I heal these rifts before taking this new relationship down prematurely? Can someone who has gone through something like this before suggest ways to keep from sabotaging great potential while affirming boundaries I need to stay sane? I can't bear the thought of this relationship taking that lonely walk too, and I need to do what I can to nudge it any direction but there."
80,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Three person clusterfuck (longass post),2,aymxww,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/aymxww/three_person_clusterfuck_longass_post/,2019-03-08 17:09:47,"I (31F) have been with my SO (29M) for almost three years. About a year and half ago a DB started to evolve on his part. Went from a couple times a week to once a week to once every couple weeks to now, about 5 minutes once a month if that; and I always initiate. But thats not the whole story. I started our relationship on the heels of a FWB situation that had lasted almost two years. This man and I had previously dated twice, but he was intent on being single because of his age and as I discovered, his lack of emotional vulnerability and fear of intimacy (he has high functioning Aspergers, so some of this was beyond his control) though we dated other people, both of us consistently preferred each other. After a long period of time with no noticeable hint of him wanting to commit or revealing his feelings, I finally gave up. My current SO and I got together, but since he respects my autonomy, the ex and I remain good friends who see each other often. The ex and I have always hung out together in groups, but occasionally well end up alone together for a bit. About two years into my current relationship, he starts behaving towards me with a level of intimacy previously completely unknown to me. He is suddenly able to use I feel language, has a healthy level of empathy, communicates without hesitation, etc. Again, if youre familiar with Aspergers, a lack of these traits are a Hallmark of the disorder. Thus, the change in his behavior was really something profound. And believe me, hes not capable of just putting it on. Its genuine. SO and move in together this past May. No emotional qualms on either of our parts, although the DB is starting to come to light, and it definitely appeared out of nowhere and for no reason. In July this past year Im hanging out with the ex and our other bestie at his house, and were all hammered. Im like six shots of tequila deep, so I decide to spend the night on his couch, Hes giving me a hug goodnight and Im so deprived that I just pull him to me and we start making out. And this shit is like a fucking movie. The way he smells, tastes, everything, drives me insane. Were both loudly moaning and rolling around like savages. It was The most erotic experience I had in years. and we didnt even have intercourse. I wouldnt let him. But we did enough. Obviously come next morning and Im feeling like a bag of dicks. Tell my SO immediately, hate myself, contemplate self harming when I havent in years (depression/mania medicated and under control) he instantly forgives me but is obviously broken from my confession. We carry on as normal but its all shifted. We still have sex occasionally and its pleasurable, but Im still unsatisfied. His attitude has changed. Something is not there, rightfully. Come this new year, I fuck up again. Im not even that drunk this time. Im wondering why the hell Im doing what Im doing, but I cant stop. To add insult to injury, ex and I are again passionately making out when he says, I love you for the first time. Ive known him for SEVEN YEARS. In the years that weve spent as lovers and best friends, Ive found out that not only has he never been in a serious relationship, hes never told a girl he loves her. He couldnt even say it to me as a friend, Then he tells me two more times, in addition to saying I fucking miss you babe with a bunch of other sweet nothings. I cannot emphasize enough just how much someone like him does not vocalize these kinds of feelings. Its as if hes finally become everything Ive encouraged him to be. Im just flabbergasted to be honest. Its now March and Im at peak ambivalence as to what to do. The ex and I have had other small incidents. I think about him constantly, but I still love my SO and the thought of breaking up with him makes me physically ill. He is nearly codependent. But I dont think I deserve him. Obviously I would be extremely wary of entering back into a relationship with ex any time soon, but despite his previous issues, he is the most compatible person Ive ever been with. Its been five years since weve dated officially and hes grown in ways that Ive never thought possible. I was certain his feelings for me would never deepen, and thats why I entered a new relationship. My SO takes care of me, but the passion is just gone. I feel like its a moot point to just wait for it to come back. Am I being selfish? Ive waited a long time. I have eternal security with my SO, but would I rather have passion and the compatibility instead of that security? I have no idea. Im so lost. "

We went to session 4 today and she is now facing that she needs to deal with the loss of both of her parents. She lost her mother when she was a teen and her father when she was in her 20s. Apparently never properly grieved them which causes issues with vulnerability, which affects our relationship both emotionally and physically. To all of you who said that she was giving me moving goal posts, you were right. To all of you who said that even she didn't know why she was shutting down, you were right. Counseling has proven to be effective so far in that it has been productive. I now have a better idea of the issues we are dealing with, which issues are for her to deal with, and which I need to accept or not."

I don't know). I wanted to let you know about the changes that have happened, however. My boyfriend naturally has a slight lower sex drive than I do. He wants sex or a release about once a week or every other week, while I'd be happiest at nearly every day/every other day. I was getting really upset about his rejections to my advances, and feeling frustrated with his lack of enthusiasm about sex. I'm generous in bed, in decent shape, and we have a great romantic relationship, so I don't think there were any problems in those regards. I'd talked to him about it openly numerous times, and had decent conversations, but that didn't induce any changes. We were having sex occasionally, and it wasn't good at all. I was thinking about breaking up, especially reading this sub, where things seem to get worse, per people's experiences. These past couple months have been different though, since one event. He was upset about a personal situation he was in and began to cry, something he's never done in front of me before. I'm not the best with these moments but I hugged him and held him and promised him I was there for him, and to let it out. I meant it genuinely, too. It seems like that bit of vulnerability has cracked a shell I didn't know he had. He has been telling me about his past, his work, his family, and all sorts of things he didn't like to approach before. He's been wanting to spend more time together. And the sex! He seems to have let go of some burden I didn't realize he was carrying. He seems free to enjoy it. He's making moves and is enjoying it more than he ever did before. Some of the things... He is learning some dirty talk, pulled my hair, is taking his time, is even asking me about fantasies and other ideas... Everything I've ever wanted. I don't want anything out of this world kinky. I just want enthusiasm and love, just like everyone else. I'm posting this not to take away from any of your stories and situations, which are often more complex and long term than this. And it isn't even advice, as I did nothing in particular. He just needed to open up, and it took a few years.I'm posting this just to say that it's possible. Love to all. "

Im looking for advice with my own sexual confidence and sexual dysfunction. Im 20F virgin who has many issues revolving around sex that stems from sexual abuse as a child and destroyed libido via antidepressants. Ive just been so incredibly sad over this and I have no one to talk to about it, and you guys seem like a friendly, experienced bunch. I dont want to suffer anymore and I dont want a future partner to deal with me either. To begin, I was molested by a friend a little older than me growing up from when I was about 8 to 12 years old. The sad thing is I knew her since I was a toddler- she was my next door neighbor. I trusted her and she betrayed me. I called her my best friend longer than anyone else in my life so far. I knew it was wrong, but I was so ashamed I never said anything at all. The worst part is I wonder if she was abused by her parents because I dont know where she got her behaviors from. Im still so angry about the abuse I endured, but I feel so incredibly guilty as it might not have been her fault... This has definitely warped my views on sex and my own sexual orientation as well because Im a lesbian. I cant help but feel disgusted at myself even though I know that there is nothing shameful about homosexuality and that I was never attracted to men anyways. With the childhood traumas out of the way now, Ive been afraid of intimacy ever since. Ive had two romantic relationships in my mid teens- and I was so scared. I would shake and tremble from subconscious flashbacks from spooning and kissing in bed! I But I pushed myself out of my comfort zone anyway because I was horny and wanted it, what can I say? Ive only ever got so far as topless foreplay, really- kisses down a girlfriends and Is backs, breasts, hips- just tender, sweet stuff that I desperately wanted to feel love and pleasure. But even that was too much for me- I completely shut down at times from the vulnerability and fear despite how badly my own body and mind craved physical intimacy. I havent had a relationship since I was 17. I turn 21 this year, and Im just craving a sex life of any kind, you know? Even if it was just with myself, which brings me to my next point: I havent came since I started my antidepressants at 15 :( I have this clitoral numbness, and the times where I may have cum, it was so underwhelming I wouldnt count it as an orgasm. Ive been off lamotreigene and Setraline (Zoloft) for a year now and I still havent come. The people over in r/PSSD (Post SSRI Sexual Dysfunction) seem helpful, but the sub is dead and caters more towards males. Anyways, Ive tried a small array of different sex toys, relaxation techniques, different lubes, cute lingerie to make me feel confident, fantasies, porn, having the house to myself and I just cant cum. I feel I tried everything except for medications and taking with a sex therapist. Ill feel some pleasure, but completely plateau, or most of the time it just stops like I hit a wall. The little pleasure I feel just fucking drops off my radar and it sucks. Im horny all the time and Im just so pent up and tired of it! Im afraid Im just completely sexually broken and that Ill never have a satisfying sex life, or even please myself. I dont want to be a LL lover that isnt receptive despite the fact that I want to be. I want to feel what sex and masturbation have to offer. I want to feel whole. So, DeadBedrooms, any advice at all or anywhere you could direct me? Thank you so much Tl;dr: Im sexually broken from trauma, shame, and fucked brain chemistry via meds. How do I learn to get comfortable with fucking others, or just being able to get myself off? "

No yelling, not anger just talking. I'm tired of being in a DB. I used the words ""I can't do this anymore"" and I know it broke her heart. Now she is open to therapy. Now she understands that I'm not going to live like this anymore. She asks me to be patient because this is hard for her. I've been patient for the last 10 years! She cried a lot and stayed turned away from me.I told her that this is the exact problem. Even more than the sex, its a lack of intimacy. That vulnerability is not something she ever shares with me. When I'm hurt she is the one I run to in order to get through things. When she's hurt she closes off and tries to fix thing on her own. It never works. It just gets buried. I'm not able to be there for her unless she lets me. I've tried to explain my frustrations time and time again and I honestly think she is understanding that I am not going to stick around for a life like this. Her words were ""It hurts to think of us possibly not being together anymore"" and my response was ""I don't have any other way I can deal the relationship as it stands now."" We talked more and I came to understand that she doesn't like to do emotional work. She is a person who is unhappy with who she has become but finds it easier to accept it as opposed to work on it. She finally sees that now. She's been telling me she is happy with who she is clearly not. We had sex last night and it was good. We went out of the normal 3 position comfort zone and we both enjoyed it. This is the cycle that usually is after these types of talks but it all gets forgotten in a week or so. I couldn't get into it too much because my mind kept telling me it's not going to last. I hope it does but I don't think it will. I'd love to be wrong. I also am getting to the point where I am tired of waiting. Even if we are FINALLY on the right path to actually addressing the intimacy issues we are having I don't know that I want to wait anymore. Best case scenario is it took her 10 years to take me seriously and now I am supposed to wait for her to actually do something about it. I'm frustrated and working on moving forward now. At this point I'm happy the way things are going now but I think i'm justified to walk away if there is. &amp;#x200B; Thanks for reading."
85,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Need help processing the things she did/said to me in order to avoid sex,1,ahwna7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/ahwna7/need_help_processing_the_things_she_didsaid_to_me/,2019-01-20 22:19:14,"HL F(30) here. First time posting on reddit, but I've lurked here a while and it was a comfort to see that I was not alone, and that feeling some very difficult emotions due to DB does not (necessarily) make me an entitled, insensitive, oversexed a-hole. I don't know what I need other than a non-judgmental place with people who have been through similar things to share this with. I was in a 6 years long relationship with a F(31), and we broke it off 8 months ago. She was my first and thus far only relationship. In the beginning I chalked the infrequency of the sex to us not seeing each other often enough, and the peculiarity of it (she'd lie there, eyes closed) to her being tired/stressed (she hated her job). And she told me that this is how real sex is like sometimes, that it's not like how it's portrayed in movies and such. That I was buying into the lie of it. Except it was like that all the time. But our life together was otherwise really good, so I figured it would get better with time. Like, she would open up more, and trust me enough to be fully vulnerable with me. Because those rare occasional moments of vulnerability from her felt so intimate and felt like progress when they occurred. I figured she needed time because she had grown up with a violent dad, and a mother who (after leaving said dad) would have sex with a lot of random dudes loudly and with the bedroom door open while she and her siblings were still in the house. My now-ex had been in therapy for it, had been diagnosed with a bipolar 2 disorder, and considered herself capable of dealing on her own now. We moved in together. The sex was still infrequent. She would flirt a lot in a sexually suggestive way, but over time I grew numb to it, because I knew it would lead nowhere. By the end of our relationship the flirting would leave me resentful because I knew she wouldn't follow through. Even her compliments felt cheap and meaningless. The lack of sex became A Thing. We'd have rows over it. We'd try to arrange special nights, only for her to drink a few glasses ""to get in the mood"" and then tell me she was too drunk for sex. We'd schedule Sunday as Sex-day, and it worked on occasion. More often than not though, she'd get mad at me over something I'd said/done, and that would be that. Like I was touching her too much, or my body language made it clear that I was mad at her for something (which I really was not, most times I'd be hopeful about the upcoming Sex), or the sexual scenario I'd created was humiliating to her (In that instance it was because, during foreplay, I'd flirtingly said ""oooh, you want it babe""). There were so many instances of days I'd hoped would be romantic/good, that turned to that painful sinking stomach sensation along with the thought that it was not coincidence that she'd pick now to get mad. I am not proud of who I became. I became a bitter and resentful person over the lack of sex. I felt like a selfish and entitled overly sexed lesbo. She told me I probably had some hormone dysfunction that gave me an overly HL, and that only wanting sex once a month or less (like her) was what was normal. She eventually told me that she couldn't pretend that things were okay anymore, and told me that she had figured out that she was asexual and that the times she felt sexual it must have been solely because of her hypomanic phase. When we broke up, my first emotion was mad relief and elation at the thought of being able to finally find someone to have sex with. I'm mad at the way she treated me, for the things she said and did in order to avoid sex, instead of just talking to me about it. I'm mad at all the times I suggested that we talk about it, and she'd brush it off or yell at me for making our relationship bad again. I know I should be thinking about how difficult it was for her, but I'm feeling kind of messed up after these 6 years. I feel like some douche that did not see her perspective on things, but I really tried. I really tried to talk to her, and I stopped initiating because I didn't want to pressure her (+ resignation set in). I don't know where else to bring it up other than here because I recognize my own reactions in what others have posted here. Sorry about the wall of text. "
86,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Emotional turmoil of a recovering DB - I am a mess...! Advice greatly appreciated,1,anpsbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/anpsbw/emotional_turmoil_of_a_recovering_db_i_am_a_mess/,2019-02-06 22:27:23,"Hello everyone, good morning, &amp;#x200B; I have to apologise for posting so much recently, but it seems as if my life is a kaleidoscope that is being slowly turned and therefore shows a new challenging pattern almost every week or even every few days.... If anyone can be bothered sharing their experience or giving me advice, I would be most grateful. It always helps to know one is not the only one who is experiencing things like this. &amp;#x200B; Now, I should start by saying that altogether things are positive, our DB is recovering. Due to circumstances we had no influence over my husband and I were hardly able to spend any time together, maybe 6 times altogether, sometimes only very briefly. That may not seem all that little, however since our DB is recovering my psyche feels the vacuum of years of emotional hurt and starts to believe it is safe to stick its nose out of its cave into the fresh air again, meaning a lot of very intense feelings that were numbed are coming to the surface. &amp;#x200B; It is almost as if I have so far gone through different stages, like there are different stages of a grieving process or when one has been cheated on: denial, anger, bargaining, acceptance, closure etc..., only that the emotions I go through are different. They feel very raw and abstract and primal, it is not the case that if I feel angry that I am thinking, ""I am angry because.."" Yesterday I was just crying a lot. It is so weird. &amp;#x200B; First there was fear of abandonment, which was huge, then anger and irritability, now, since yesterday, it is something entirely new: anger and fear of abandonment have subsided, and now it is as if a door inside my soul is timidly opening and all the really, really old feeling of love and romance from the very beginning of our relationship are coming out again. I always knew they were there, and I always felt my love for him strongly, but that intense honeymoon feeling, not sexually but emotionally, is coming back. &amp;#x200B; That makes me think that in general a honeymoon phase is perhaps never really over, it just gets covered up because of the inevitable stress and hurt that may happen in every relationship to some extent. The soul closes that door, because it feels too vulnerable. A coping mechanism. Self protection. Because that is that honeymoon feeling: to be in love in a way that all emotional barriers collapse, and the innermost part of one's soul becomes visible. And that is terrifying. One cannot afford to be that vulnerable if one gets hurt. &amp;#x200B; The feeling of vulnerability that comes with this is indeed enormous, especially as I believe I have reached this stage way before my husband, and I have no idea if he will get there again, ever. I believe it is possible. I asked him once, and he said yes. In general, we have made such amazing progress that I have no doubt that in the end we will get there. &amp;#x200B; Here is the problem though; I have heard before that the phenomenon of sabotaging the progress of a recovering DB is very real, so I have to be guarded about this because I feel this is a real danger for me. The other part is, how to stay balanced with all these changes going on, how to stay cool and calm, how not to be too demanding towards the partner because one is already a few stages ahead compared to them. Just in general, this emotional experience that is ever changing is absolutely terrifying. Yes, it is magical, too, but scary af. I believe I need to ""lean back"" and just ""be"" in that stage and that moment of my emotions, independently from my husband, and just keep my turmoil to myself, as an individual. The danger lies in the fact that my soul wants to deal with it as 50% of that relationship, meaning in relation to my husband and connected with him, and I feel this doesn't work and is a very dangerous thing. &amp;#x200B; So, again, if anyone would like to share their experiences or has any insight, I would be so grateful to hear about them. I have received such precious advice from you guys before and it has honestly helped so much, but this ever changing state is just weirding me out, lol. :-) &amp;#x200B; I wonder honestly why there does not seem to be a book about this process, because this is seriously powerful stuff...! I am sure psychologists know about this.. I wish there was a book about how to deal with DB recovery alone, just that stage of things. Sigh.... &amp;#x200B; Anyway, have a great day if possible and be kind to yourselves. :-)"

My husband and I had a very healthy and active sex life. It took us nearly 3 years to conceive our daughter. So obviously while trying there was regular sex. Then the pregnancy hormones made me crave physical affection even more. He was stoked! We were very lucky in that the baby slept through the night from 5 weeks old. All in all, our daughter did not disrupt our sex life at all. When we decided to try for baby number 2, I got pregnant almost immediately. I had a terrible pregnancy with our son. I was constantly sick, was put on bed rest after 5 months and hated the thought of intimacy. He was also a very clingy baby, and didnt sleep through the night until well over a year old. Even though things have gone back to 'normal' I'm struggling with my libido. Once we are having sex I enjoy it, it's just the act of initiation and building arousal I have trouble with. I take a lot more time to become aroused than I used to, and to be very brutally frank, he just doesn't put in the effort he used to with his personal grooming. If I'm trying my hardest to allow myself to enter into a space of vulnerability and arousal then I dont want to be put off by the smell of his breath because he hasn't bothered to brush his teeth or trim his nails (ouch!). Yes, I have broached this subject with him frequently. At the moment we are only having sex about once a month. I know he loves our son, but I know he blames him for our dead bedroom, he jokes about it a lot too. I feel at fault for my difficulties in becoming aroused and I know he feels rejected and unloved because of my low libido. "
88,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Making progress,1,aba5jc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/aba5jc/making_progress/,2019-01-01 06:08:10,"After 16 years of bedroom issues, my husband (43m) and I (39f) are making good progress. He has severe hang-ups with initiating due to religious shaming, his family of origin being very weird about anything sexual (he has never even seen his parents kiss or hold hands or say the word sex), and being uncomfortable with vulnerability and any kind of conflict (lots of shutting down over the tiniest of issues). My emotional health and self esteem have been through the wringer and, frankly, his have too. We've had the talk about a thousand million times with little improvement and often things getting worse. Getting him/us into marriage and sex counseling has been a long, frustrating process. Gratefully, my individual therapist requested my husband attend one of my therapy sessions. I was super nervous about my husband attending for fear he'd feel ganged up on. My therapist handled the conversation so gracefully with kindness but also holding my husband's feet to the fire. It was terrific. She recommended he initiate sex as much as possible to get over his anxiety about initiating. He has really upped his game and we've had sex at least twice a week for a few weeks now. I wanted to only be positive in order to encourage him but honestly the sex was mediocre. While he did initiate, it was with zero enthusiasm, like someone was holding a gun to his head. Because he's extremely sensitive to criticism or conflict, I held it in. I finally broke down when he asked me in an absolutely robotic voice if I'd like oral sex. His approach was a huge turn off, yet he WAS initiating, yet I still felt terrible about it. He actually handled the feedback very well and we've had the most emotionally satisfying sex in a long time, maybe ever. I really, really, really wish we would have gotten marital and sex therapy a long time ago but due to cost and (mostly) his emotional discomfort, it hasn't happened. "
89,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Request letter details from my previous post. URL,1,a0er8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/a0er8z/request_letter_details_from_my_previous_post/,2018-11-26 12:41:32,"Warning. This will be long. Some people have requested that I put down some of the things I wrote in my letter to my wife. I want to preface this with three notes. 1) Many things are left out because they are personal stories or private references that just wont be relevant. 2) I only had 1 afternoon to smash this together and it was a busy work day. So I brain dumped it out. No real proof reading was done. It was raw and in-edited at the time. I am going to resist the urge to edit my wording. So please resist the urge to quibble over minor technicalities. 3) This info only really went in because my wife was willing to hear it. She initiated the talk for once. And that is ultimately the primary success factor here. On with the show then. Intimacy First off intimacy reaches from the surface to the deepest depths of all of our meaningful relationships. Knowing a bad mood. Knowing what each different smile means. Seeing a stressed frown. Intimacy happens when there is enough comfort in a relationship to drop the facade and be the unfiltered You. [I go on to mention her intimate sibling relationships and relationship to her mother]. I believe that you and I are very intimate with each other in most areas of our lives. I think that we are in a really great place. But I do see that we have so much more potential that is being held back for various reasons. I see a place off in the distance. Where we are so free and open and honest and passionate with each other. That we will blow our own socks off. I just cant get there on my own. I need my partner to help us decide when to zig left or zag right. And when to charge straight ahead. Passion This is the one part of intimacy that we have agreed to share monogamously. It is the one part of intimacy that you would not share with your sister or mother or best friends. It feels like our passion is in disarray. I am not saying that we do not have great sex. But passion is so much more than sex. Passion is about a passion for the other persons mind/thoughts/feelings/happiness, as much as it is about physical passion. Connection I feel connected and attracted to you when I see you are happy. When I hear you laugh. When you talk about something you love. I feel attracted to your body when I hear you laugh. See you smile. Watch you move. All of these things are interlinked in a web. It is impossible for me to feel connected to your feelings and who you are as a person. Without being reminded I am incredibly attracted to your body and your pleasures. Just like it is impossible for me to make love to you and your body without being completely aware that I am making love to a woman who is kind and generous and funny. Vulnerability and gladness. This is about being able to express your thoughts or ideas. About love or anything close to your heart. And having that be received with gladness. We dont always have to agree with what is being expressed. Or how it is being expressed. And we can communicate how and why we disagree. But we should always be glad that the other person felt safe enough with us to express themselves without fear of rejection or shame. Because that is openness and connection. Hurt When I express sexual intimacy and feel that the intimacy is not being genuinely reciprocated or appreciated/accepted. Or even worse, feel that the intimacy is unwelcome for whatever reason ( I know that I have my part to play in how that fear or anxiety got there and I am trying to identify them and fix them ). Then I experience hurt/rejection/failure. The trouble is that it is impossible for you to draw a line between sexual intimacy and normal intimacy in any relationship that has unlocked the sexual intimacy door. Which is why you have a hard time distinguishing between my random expressions of loving intimacy (with no actual sexual connotations from my side) and genuinely suggestive expressions. You reject both types in equal measure (some of the time), because at that moment, you are scared that leaning into the intimate moment will create a feeling in me that sex is now on offer. And you dont want to have to fulfill that offer all of the time. So it is easier for you to just reject. To send me the message that sex is not on offer. But the message you are actually sending is that intimacy is off limits and not appreciated. When I am feeling hurt over rejected intimacy. I find it painful to be intimate in non-sexual ways too. So I avoid intimacy, which creates distance between us. Which results in me getting angry that I am not being attentive husband that I aspire to be. Then I try accepting the pain in order to keep us closer. But this takes its toll over time. Because the more attentive I am of you and us. The more I am reminded of the pain. Until eventually it starts to affect my mood when those feelings of hurt/rejection have not been temporarily replaced by validation/connection. So I alternate between being moody or distant. As and when I can and cant handle the pain. Or can and cant handle my own lack of attentiveness. Sexual passion [I talk about it being a button that should not be kept behind a closed door and only let out on schedule. Or out of duty] it should be a button that you want to be pressed. And one that if it is pressed in the right way. This should cause you to immediately say: dishes/online shopping/Laundry/texting/facebooking can all wait. This button needs more pressing right now! You should also feel comfortable enough to have your buttons out in the open. And know that you can safely have them pressed without having to promise anything more than the initial touch. There is nothing sexier than a woman going over to her man and saying Here is my button, and I choose YOU to press it right now. Or You just pressed all of the right buttons and I cant hold back for another second. If you let some passionate moment interrupt your evening activities without regard for when the moment will end. And without focusing on whether you will have enough time to finish the menial chores before bed. I can guarantee you that after a session of sex. Or fooling around. Or just being close and connecting and talking and caressing. If you said to me You know, I was planning on hanging up that wet washing. Or packing/unpacking the dishwasher before we got so sidetracked. It is a bit late now. Do you think you could do those things for me? I would hang that washing on the Great Wall of China if you asked me to. And NOT because I am now paying for the price of sex. But because in that one sentence you just told me that my intimate worth to you was greater than those menial chores. When intimacy is only ever on offer once all chores have been done. It sends the message that I/We come last in importance. And that is just no way to have a long lasting, happy and healthy relationship. Because how can either of us place passion and intimacy for the other persons mind/ thoughts/ feelings/ desires/ hopes / dreams/ interests ahead of all other things when one major aspect of intimacy is constantly in last place? It cant work. At some point either passion and sexual intimacy needs to move up the list or all the others need to move down to join it. And I feel like the latter situation has been happening more and more. And that has made me a worse husband, a worse father and a worse man. I cant do that to myself, or to the kids, or to you anymore. I know that if we re-ignite our passion for each other. Both in and out of the bedroom. And if we place that passion high up on our priority list. That we have the potential to reach a kind of love and happiness that most people can only dream of. And I am All-In on finding out what that destination might hold for us. [ I also stress that climax and cumming is not the end goal of every passionate encounter.] End And so that is it. Lots left out and it is still a mammoth wall. So much of the letter was disjointed. And I honestly dont know how much of an effect the letter had. My wife tells me that the Sex starved marriage tedx bid was the hardest hitter. When I asked about the latter my wife looked a little pained and overwhelmed and said. It was long. I think that it was quite brutally honest in some parts. Some of those that were left out. And by the time she was reading it she had already made up her mind to start fresh on a new page with our Intimacy. That opening up any conversation about the contents of the letter might bog us down in the past. Luckily I didnt press for more details on her thoughts on the letter. As I have said a few times recently. And as almost all Recovering DBers say too. Us HLs can say these things until we are blue in the face. But until the LL is truly willing and open to hear it and pay attention. It just wont sink in and nothing will truly change. "

I wrote her a letter that I probably wont send: Saying to me enough with the sex guilt trip is really hurtful. First of all, I dont do guilt trips. Guilt trips are all about manipulating someone and overemphasising your own emotions to try and make someone else feel guilty or ashamed. I dont ever want you to feel guilty. I try and explain how our sexual relationship makes me feel, and I go it genuinely and from a place of honesty and vulnerability. If anything I dont tell you how Im feeling all the time because you already shame me for needing physical contact with you. Secondly, the fact that you say what do you want me to do says everything you need to know. You dont take any responsibility for our relationship. Its all down to me to keep things going, to try and keep us connected, to innovate and initiate sex. And not just sex - everything. Time together; conversations about our emotions and about our days. You never ask how my day at work is. You text me all day long but its never about us. Its never lets have some time together tonight, or, cant wait to see you tonight ;) or lets try this position or that thing tonight. But youre happy to spend all day messaging me ideas you come up with for food or Christmas trees or whatever. I sometimes go on your phone and look at your internet history in the vain hope that you might have googled ways to spice up sex life or how can I connect with my spouse. But its always greys anatomy season 14 start or ways of getting stain out. Weve had this conversation so many times. But you just dont seem to understand how our love life affects me. Sex isnt just about getting a quick orgasm. Its an essential part of connection. I need that connection with you. When were laid next to each other and my arms reach out and you reject me, at that moment when I roll over and try and go to sleep, its the loneliest feeling in the world. I feel like Im on an island in the middle of the ocean with no hope of rescue. Its excruciating - I feel utterly dejected, unwanted, unattractive, unsexy. I go over it in my mind. Maybe Im bad at sex? Maybe I dont do enough to help at home? Maybe Im a bad husband and dont give support? I think maybe if she was with someone better in bed, shed be more in to sex. What if shed be really sexually open with another man if we werent together. I know this is illogical but it just reflects how I feel about myself. Just wanted to share. "

We recently came to an agreement where if he's not in the mood, he'll just go down on me and make me come and that will be it... but I'm starting to regret suggesting that. Sex for me has never been about the orgasms or the sensations, it's always been about the vulnerability and the intimacy and the affection. I could care less about orgasming, I can do that on my own (and better). It's about being in the arms of someone who loves you, who *wants* you in that moment. I don't want head as a consolation prize. I want to feel him *need* me and touch me like he wants to touch me. *Sigh* ....and now I'm crying at work."

95,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,DB Complicated by Increasing Physical Violence,18,9fbvdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/9fbvdk/db_complicated_by_increasing_physical_violence/,2018-09-13 07:22:51," At this point I (29 F) feel that I must seek outside help. My boyfriend (26 M) and I have been struggling with achieving a mutually satisfying sexual relationship together. He sometimes gets physically violent with me during arguments, and it seems to be getting worse. I have known him for 6 years, but we have been a couple for about 3 years. We became a couple only because I refused to continue acting like a girlfriend to him while he denied commitment and did all sorts of shady, manipulative, and deceitful things with other girls. Our issues in the bedroom began early. He always struck me as selfish and lazy in bed, as well as when it comes to helping with cooking, cleaning, etc. He has brought me to orgasm about 4 times over these 6 years. At first I was somewhat surprised at how quickly he finished (always just a couple minutes), but thought that he was young, and excited, and it was a turn on for me initially. He has expressed that he does care if I I orgasm and said he wants me to (after me asking him straight up), but I frankly do not believe that anymore. Foreplay consists of me doing everything or there is none. Sex consists of me doing most things, and I still never reach orgasm. He has gone down on me for a couple of seconds on 3 separate occasions, once because I asked him if he wanted to, no pressure. I have asked him why he doesn't go down on me and he sheepishly told me that he's ""just not that into that,"" and ""I don't want to feel obligated to do it."" Besides me asking once if he would like to I have never asked or guilted him into doing anything. We rarely have sex, but I know he was mastrubating to porn heavily and probably still is. I'm never satisfied, and while I express that I like when we have sex or fool around and that its fun and enjoyable, I don't lie or fake orgasms (I did sometimes before because I felt like he has such little confidence having sex with me and wanted to be encouraging. I now know how this is misguided, and I try to be positive, encouraging, and I no longer have lengthy conversations about sex with him, as those conversations always upset him). He is aware of my frustration, but doesn't put in much effort. We also get into fights that are increasingly violent. He has hurt me verbally many times, saying I was crazy, stupid, not deserving of respect, weak, a cunt, etc. He has spit on my face, pushed me to the ground, and damaged my personal property (such as the numerous dents in my car) as well as punched numerous holes in the walls and kicked cabinets off their hinges. He has thrown water in my face and then thrown the glass at me. He once grabbed me by the hair and threw me to the ground, and then pulled me up by my hair, all in public. He only let go when someone yelled for him to let me go or they would call the cops. A few months ago I tried to leave the house when he was yelling at me he slammed the door on my hand, which broke 3 of my fingers and cut the tips of my fingers open, requiring a trip to the hospital with me in the passenger trying not to cry anymore because the crying is making him more angry as he drove me to the hospital. The hospital workers tried to talk me into pressing charges in private, but I just didn't want to. I love him. Eventually the stitches came off, and while I still have scars and nerve damage in two of my fingers I thought things would never, ever, get like that again. Or at least never that bad. He seemed genuinely sorry. He could not promise to not do that again, and he politely maintained that we both need to not get so mad, that he's not an angry person but I just can't get him so angry. He says that I ""push him to that point."" He explained that I push him to getting physical with me because I ""go on and on,"" ""don't let things go,"" ""have to talk about everything,"" ""make everything complicated and not easy."" Recently we fought after not fighting for a while. The reason was strangely simple. I thought that I asked him to do something (not to leave empty dog food cans in the sink because they rust), and he denies that I ever told him. I said, ""Oh, ok, well I'll just tell you again to please not leave them in the sink."" He said that wasn't a fair thing to say, since he does not recall me ever telling him, so it wouldn't be ""again."" I understood what he meant, and told him I understand what he's saying, and began to explain that the reason why I worded it in such a way was because I was speaking from my experience, so I used the word ""again,"" but explained that I wasn't saying he was wrong. I told him that I could be remembering wrong and maybe I didn't ever ask him. He didn't understand, so I tried to explain again. I could tell he was getting frustrated, so I was trying to be clear, and have no negative tone in my voice. He eventually got mad, and yelled something at me while I was speaking. I felt the blood rush to my face, and said that I wouldn't talk to him while he was yelling. He yelled more and I can't remember what he said. I yelled back, ""Stop yelling at me! I can't take this!"" And he came up to my face, very close. The look in his eyes was frightening, and I was taken back by the hostility in them. Inches away from my face he tells me to get out of the room he is in. I calmly and flatly reply, without backing away, ""Do not command me."" He repeated himself, ""Get out of the room!"" And I just stood there. He then quickly tried to get around me, and I quickly moved out of the way, grabbing my sandals to go outside for some air. He, I suppose, was planning on doing the same, as when he turned around and saw me heading towards the back door he grabbed me with both hands by the throat. I started screaming as he held me by my neck, and I was pushing on his chest to get him away from me. He let go, and I tried to get away from him when we suddenly grabbed me by my hair, threw me to the ground, and started choking me again as he pushed me against the kitchen cabinets. I tried screaming again, which came out all high-pitched and strained, and he frantically told me to ""Stop making noise! Stop making noise!"" I stopped trying to scream, and tried not to cry but I couldn't help it, and I felt the pressure building in my face and neck and head and I laid my hands gently on his and nodded my head. His grip loosened but he didn't let go, and though tears I said, ""Please, papa"" calling him my nickname for him not to be manipulative but honestly because that is what came out. He let me go and I got away from him as fast as I could. I grabbed my keys and drove off, though I could only drive a few blocks because I was crying and too upset to drive safely. He was really silent when I came back home. I had to lead most of the talking, I had to initiate the healing and reconnection. Though he was willing to reconcile, he again didn't say anything about what happened. He did ask what he could do to make things better, to fix things, as I was so hurt and sad and numb and he could tell. I told him that I didn't know, that I wasn't expecting something specific, but I would be open to try and be receptive to whatever he did want to say or try and do. He didn't say much. He was very sweet though, and kind. Later that night he wanted to have sex, and was more eager and excited than he has been in long time. I'm still with him because I love him. I have been in a few serious relationships before him, and while the sex in those past relationships was amazing, I have never felt more in tune with someone, more fascinated by their intellect, and unique mind. Before I met him I felt empty, dulled by the harshness of life and the pain from my abusive childhood. He makes me feel alive, and there is nothing I want more than for us to grow, together and individually, into our potentials. But that day I was actually afraid of him. The thought flashed in my mind about how sad, how tragic, how utterly heartbreaking that my love is trying to hurt me. Maybe even kill me. The man that tickles me and places his big hand on the side of my face. The man whose back I rub after he's worked all day, not because he asked but because I want him to feel nice. The man that I would love and cherish until the end. I do not want to just leave. Perhaps a big part of the problem is me, and perhaps there are things I have not done, have not changed about myself. Before the choking incident he told me that perhaps I'm right in that he needs help with his anger, that it actually is an issue that exists and needs to be changed. He told me this a few weeks ago as he was picking up pieces of drywall after he punched another hole in the wall. With a vulnerability in his voice he said, ""Maybe I do need help. But I need your help most of all."" I can't just leave him. I love him. Even now, I see his huge shoes next to mine by the front door and my heart crumbles. I once dreamed of traveling the world with him, experiencing everything and creating the most beautiful art and sharing the world with the children we could have. Now, I cannot bring children into such a situation. A violent man and a weak woman who doubts herself so much. I don't know why I'm posting this. I don't have specific expectations in mind. But to whoever took the time to read this, to respond with any shred of insight or glimpse into your opinion - thank you. Without someone to talk to about this I feel I may just disintegrate. I oscillate between feeling like there must be so much wrong with me and that I'm a bad person, to feeling like I'm just a stupid, weak person. Your advice means so much to me. "
96,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,The School of Life,10,9fju2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/9fju2a/the_school_of_life/,2018-09-14 03:09:03,"I recently found this Youtube channel called The School of Life. Occasionally, they post blurbs about relationships and their difficulties. If you find yourself wondering why your partner is refusing to have sex with you, and yet still evidently has a sex drive (confirmed *not* LL, but actively withholding), you **need** to read this. I couldn't directly link to the post, but you can find it on their channel quite easily. &amp;#x200B; &gt;*HOW WE FIGHT WHEN THERE IS NO SEX IN OUR COUPLES* &gt; &gt;It could, on the surface, be an argument about almost anything: what time to leave for the airport, who forgot to post the tax form, where to send the children to school... But in reality, in disguise, unmentioned and unmentionable, it is typically the very same argument, the no-sex argument, the single greatest argument that ever afflicts committed couples, the argument which has powered more furious oblique exchanges among lovers than any other, the argument that right now, explains why one person is angrily refusing to speak to another over a bowl of Udon noodles in a restaurant in downtown Yokohama and another is screaming in an apartment on an upper floor of a block in the suburbs of Belo Horizonte, why a child has acquired a step-parent and a person is crying over a bottle or at their therapists office. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The real injury - you have ceased to want me and I can no longer bear myself or you - cant be mentioned because it cuts us too deep; it threatens too much of our dignity, it is bigger than we are. In the darkness late at night, time after time, our hand moved towards theirs, tried to coax them into a caress and was turned down. They held our fingers limply for a moment and then, as if we were the monster we now take ourselves to be, curled away from us and disappeared into the warren of sleep. We have stopped trying now. It may happen once in a blue moon, a few times a year, but we understand the score well enough: we are not wanted. We feel like outcasts, the only ones to be rejected in this way, the victims of a rare disease; nursing an emotional injury far too shaming to mention to others let alone ourselves, the only ones not be having sex in a happy sex-filled world. Our anger aggravates our injury and traps us in cycles of hostility. Perhaps they dont want us in the night because we have been so vile in the day; but so long as our hand goes unwanted, we can never muster the courage to be anything but vindictive in their presence. It hurts more than being single, when at least the neglect was to be expected. This is a sentence without end. We can neither complain, nor let the issue go. We feel compelled to fight by proxy about anything we can lay our hands on: the washing powder and the walk to the park, the money for the dentist and the course of the nations politics, all because we so badly need to be held and to hold, to penetrate or to be penetrated. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;It is in a sense deeply strange, even silly that so much should hang on this issue, that the future of families, the fate of children, the division of assets, the survival of a friendship group, should depend on the right sort of frottage of a few centimetres of our upper limbs. Its the tiniest thing and at the same time the very largest. The absence of sex matters so much because sex itself is the supreme conciliator and salve of all conflict, ill-feeling, loneliness and disinterest. It is almost impossible to make love and be sad, indifferent or bitter. Furious perhaps, in a passionate and ardent way. But not - almost always - truly elsewhere or beset by major grievance. The act forces presence, vulnerability, honesty, tenderness, release. It matters inordinately because it is the ultimate proof that everything is, despite everything, still OK. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As ever, so much would change if only we could be helped to find the words, if we could fight our way past our shame, if we didnt have to feel so alone (this should be proof enough that we arent); if we could point to the problem without fury, without humiliation, without defensiveness; if we could simply name our desperation without becoming desperate, if the one who didnt want it could explain in terms that made sense and were bearable and the one who felt cast aside could explain without surrendering to vindictiveness or despair. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;We would ideally, alongside physics and geography, learn the basics of all this in our last year at high school, learn how to spot and assuage the no-sex argument with an in-depth course and regular refreshments throughout our lives. It is the paradigm of all arguments. Those who can get over it can get over pretty much any dispute; those who cannot must squabble to the grave. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Were our species to learn how to do this, the world would be suddenly and decisively calmer: there would be infinitely fewer fights, alcoholic outbursts, divorces, affairs, rages, denunciations, recriminations, civil wars, armed conflicts and nuclear conflagrations. At the first signs of no-sex arguments, couples would know how carefully to locate the words that could address their sorrow. There would not always be an answer, but there would always be the right sort of conversation - and, on a good day, the endurance of love. &amp;#x200B;"

Instead of copy and pasting chapters of information, I will link two videos made by Mr. Kappas, a link to a summary of these videos, also an online quiz for your personality type. &amp;#x200B; [The Art of Relationship  Emotional &amp; Physical Sexuality](URL [E&amp;P - Emotional and Physical Sexuality / Who You Are in Relationships - Part One](URL [Part Two](URL [Quiz; which one are you?](URL &amp;#x200B; Below is a copy and paste of another blog [URL Whereas suggestibility (how we learn) is learned/acquired from the primary caretaker (usually, mom), the secondary caretaker (typically dad or another father figure) typically models sexual personality traits. Like suggestibility, a persons Sexual Personality (E &amp; P) is described as varying degrees of Emotional and Physical characteristics. However, emotional and physical Sexual Personality characteristics are *not* interchangeable with emotional and physical Suggestibility. In his research, Dr. Kappas observed that an individuals Sexual Personality starts to develop during childhood, typically when the youngster is between eight and fourteen years old. He hypothesized that, at a very subconscious level, modeling the sexual personality traits of the father figure is a way for the child to get (metaphorically) closer to Mother. Unlike suggestibility, which can change somewhat and be affected by different events in an individuals life, Sexual Personality does not alter that much during a persons lifetime. Furthermore, these characteristics facilitate understanding and the ability to predict and shape a persons behavior. I and my colleagues who also went through the hypnotherapy certification program at HMI appreciate the value and utility of this model when we work with our own clients to achieve their vocational and avocational self-improvement goals. Following are highlights of Dr. Kappass model of E&amp;P Sexual Personality:  Emotional and Physical Sexuality is *NOT* a male/female thing. The male can be emotional and the female can be Physical, and vice versa.  Opposites attract: An Emotional (e.g., social wall-flower) is drawn to the Physical (e.g., social butterfly), and vice versa because we are naturally attracted to our equal opposites. There is more intensity, more vulnerability with your opposite.  There is *a subconscious goal to increase/raise the subdominant personality.* For example: The goal of the Physical partner is to raise the Emotional partners subdominant trait (physicality).  Different partners trigger different behaviors, depending on your E/P score  The E&amp;P score will also differ depending on the phase of the relationship (Honeymoon vs. Crisis)  50/50 scores on the Sexuality test indicate: We dont know what you are. You will have a different score for different relationships, different phases of the relationship. But you will always have a basic personality.  You can out-Phys/out-Emo a same partner. Opposite partners/relationships are more intense, but there is 10 times more vulnerability when you are with your subconscious opposite. **4 CORE TRAITS of the Emotional/Physical Sexual Personality** *(You must have positive confirmation of 3 core traits before deciding/identifying the sexual personality.)* 1. **Parental background** (when the pattern breaks, you need to find out why. Parents may be going through a different phase of their relationship.) 2. **Response to rejection** (When rejected, the Physical Sexual clings to the partner vs. an Emotional Sexual, who freezes out the partner) 3. **Relationship with the physical body** (comfortable vs. uncomfortable with physical contact) A Physical Sexual is connected/immediacy to the emotion, needs physical contact. There is a physical sensation with emotional reaction, somatization in the body. The Emotional Sexual has a disconnect of physical sensation to emotion. Sometimes the Emotional doesnt know how he/she feels. Emotional protects the body, has a territory/boundary because the Emotional doesnt know how they feel about their body or feelings. 4. **Patterns of personal relationships** (History of E/P partners. For example, if you are constantly attracted to a Physical Sexual, you are probably an Emotional Sexual, and vice versa.) &amp;#x200B; *Emotionals* *vs. Physicals* * Emotional Sexual individuals dont like to confront their partner. Physical Sexual individuals have no problem asking for or demanding what they want and need. * Guilt controls the Emotional Sexual partner. The Physical Sexual partner feels actual, physical pain during a break-up, but when the relationship is over an Emotional seems to move on to a new relationship. (A bad break-up can take the Physical out of the dating game for a very long time in some cases, or subconsciously chooses another Physical partner because the previous experience with the Emotional lover/end of relationship was so traumatic.) * The Emotional Sexual partner has 3-day cycles for sexual receptiveness. Day 3 is optimal for sexual intimacy/likelihood of the Emotional Sexual to solicit sexual contact from the partner. On day 3, the Emotional Sexual is most Physical (sub-dominance). * Sex and the relationship are two different/separate things for the Emotional Sexual partner. The Emotional Sexual can compartmentalize: Its just sex with a mistress. * Sex and the relationship are the one and the same for the Physical Sexual partner. A Physical Sexual person cant imagine being sexually intimate without feeling an emotional connection with the other person. * *BOTH* the Emotional Sexual and Physical Sexual partner wants control in the relationship but go about getting it in different ways. For example, the Physical Sexual partner shouts/pouts/makes demands for more attention. Conversely, the Emotional Sexual Partner freezes out/ignores the Physical Sexual partner, which makes the Physical Sexual partner become even more needyshouting/making demands until one of them walks away from the relationship or reconciles the difference. The subconscious goal of the Physical Sexual partner is to raisethe Emotional partners subdominant (Physical Sexual) trait in order to receive the affection and attention that he or she needs and craves. Similarly the subconscious goal of the Emotional Sexual partner is to lower the Physical Sexual partners physicality in order to give the Emotional more space to feel desire and come forward. To reduce negative tension and increase physical desire between the Emotional and Physical Sexual partners, Dr. Kappas recommended that each individual give a Twinkie (a metaphoric treat or favor) in the form of a desired behavior, from time to time. For example: * The Physical Sexual partner can give the Emotional partner space to do his/her own thing for a little while or be an asset to the Emotional partners career. * The Emotional Sexual partner can send love notes to the Physical partner, have flowers delivered, etc. to show that he/she is thinking about the other person even when not in the mood for physical intimacy. * Understanding the 3-day cycle and planning intimacy around this is giving a Twinkie as well. Physical partner is usually responsible for this gesture because the Physical is most likely to feel/be sensitive to Emotional partners inadvertent rejection on Day 1 and Day 2 of the sexual cycle. * The Emotional partner has 3-day cycles for sexual receptiveness. Day 3 is optimal for sexual intimacy/likelihood of the Emotional to solicit sexual contact from the partner. On day 3, the Emotional is most Physical (sub-dominance). * Cubicle release: The Emotional Sexual wants a strong sensation/ultimate sexual experience to really feel intimate with the partner. 1 ejaculation vs. 3  for the physical partner, who can ejaculate in smaller volumes to have many experiences. * Buy the symptoms of the opposite behavior: When the Emotional is cycling, its not about you (the Physical partner). Its about cycle days, so give the Emotional partner the space to come to you (the physical partner). If the Emotional partner only encounters the Physical partner on a cycle day, he/she can feel even more physical. This good experience shortens the length of time between cycle days. &amp;#x200B; I hope this helps"

102,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Neither of us are initiating and nobody is talking about it,2,926rtd,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/926rtd/neither_of_us_are_initiating_and_nobody_is/,2018-07-27 08:14:32,"I guess the last time was either a month or two ago and I formally asked, ""Do you want to spend some special alone time with me?"" She chuckled, and said that I didn't have to be so formal. And further explained that she was thinking that since we had spent a great deal of time together that weekend that she felt especially bonded, and that she had been thinking perhaps we would have ""special alone time"" as well. Well, she elaborated on her thoughts on the matter in a nearly one sided conversation for an hour or so, and then we did have some special alone time together. Before that, the last time was after vacation. We had been on vacation together for about a week and a night or two after our return, I initiated sex. She said, ""aren't you tired?"" (from the trip, I guess). Indeed, I was tired from the trip and I was still interested in sex with her. So we had sex. That was in the beginning of April. We've been together just over 3 years and have never had a very active sex life. I am attracted to her, and I do want to have sex sometimes, but I don't want to have to initiate it all the time and I don't always want to have hour long conversations about whether we should or not. It gets easier and easier to pass on sex rather than exert what little energy it takes to initiate sex. Perhaps I don't want to risk rejection. I reason that she is busy with graduate school and that we've had a lot of changes in the past year. She had a hard time adjusting to living with me because she's never lived with a partner before. She cried and was upset the first few months we moved in together. She had a hard time adjusting to my mannerisms and temperament. I had a hard time adjusting to her schedule. These are all very valid reasons to forgo sex... as is any other reason, perhaps. I've been spending a great deal of time in the workshop with my vintage bicycle and hanging with my bicycle friends. Sometimes I intentionally do not invite her on rides. Both of us are exercising our independence in this relationship. Amidst all of this, she reciprocated my proposal (I proposed last March in the Grand Canyon). She proposed to me on the 7th of this month. (unconsummated, of course). And I guess that is a sign that she thinks all is well, or that all is going to be okay, or that everything has been okay. She expressed optimism about our future together and we've talked about marriage. She'll be done with her graduate degree in two years, and hopes to marry in a year. I have a pattern of sexual anorexia that I'm hoping to overcome. A behavior that is a symptom/sign of the sexual anorexia is that I turn inward and have conversations in my mind instead of having conversations with my partner, especially about intimate topics... namely sex. I am challenged by the vulnerability of it all. I feel, though, at this point that if I don't initiate the conversation, then the conversation will not happen. It will fall by the wayside. I don't think that she will initiate the conversation and I sometimes wonder if she thinks about being intimate or close or having sex at all."
103,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Still trying to figure it out. Are we doing it right?,8,9481u8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/9481u8/still_trying_to_figure_it_out_are_we_doing_it/,2018-08-03 19:11:16,"I started lurking deadbedrooms years ago. At the time my husband (HL) and I (LLF), late20s/early 30s had a dead bedroom. I hated it. I don't know if I ever was HL honestly. When the relationship was new we fucked each other raw (those few times we could meet). We had to stop cause our bodies couldn't keep up. But then it turned to nothing. It's a long story, summary was though that at the time there were a lot of stressors and we managed to remove most of them and things picked up a little (it did take a year or so, though). I could probably write half a book about that part as is, and my situation may not contribute anything helpful, but last I was lurking actively here I noticed mostly unhappy HLs, while I'm an unhappy LL, and I always wondered if I could maybe find a 'cure' for this issue since I'm on the other side of the spectrum, but I don't think I can. My husband is in his prime years. He's always up for it. Always in the mood. He lets me know. Not in intrusive ways. And he's always respectful about it. When the dead bedroom first hit us (which was in our first year of marriage no less. Awful. Also gotta add we started off as long distance so we started living together once we got married. Another long story.) it was me who was the wreck. It always is. I never wanted sex. I mean, emotionally I did. Emotionally I would do it with him until he's dry if I could. But physically it was like I was stuck in a metal cage. My body screamed NO. Not having sex ruined me. I felt I failed the person I love. I love him dearly and I can feel he loves me as well. Many times I ended up bawling my eyes out cause I was so frustrated. Other times when we did try to have sex it hurt. It felt like his member was a knife going through me and he decided to stop. I tried to pull through but my body refused me. It didn't always hurt thankfully and the times it didn't my husband told me to remember how good this feels for next time when I'm scared of it. More time went by and it has been a struggle on and off. My sense of time is non-existant, and if it were for how it feels we do it maybe once a month, but hubby says it's more often. Every day feels like an eternity to me. The thing is, I love sex. I know I do. After our initial life change when DB hit us sex hasn't hurt anymore. Only rarely (maybe 1% of the time). There is NOT A SINGLE TIME I have ever regretted having sex with my husband. And that's the important part I try to remember. I love him. He loves me. Sex is, in my opinion, the best way to communicate that. There's no other time in which you're so exposed and vulnerable it's in that vulnerability when you can truly touch each other. Not just physically. I guess we don't have a dead bedroom anymore in the sense I learned to understand it (no sex for months/years straight). We last did it about 2 days ago. It was great as usual. Honestly, it's getting better with every time. But actually getting to the point of sex is still a struggle. My body still doesn't want it. And I don't trust my body enough to ""perform"". What if I don't get wet? What if it hurts? What if we have to stop and I fail him again? I know it's worries that are probably stupid. And my husband has never complained if we had to stop. And he's always understanding. Sometimes he takes care of himself, sometimes he doesn't tell me he does. I'm so mad at my body that it's causing this stupid anxiety in me. Back then I resorted to telling him honestly that I'm not in mood, but that I want him to try to get me to that point. And I don't remember him ever failing at it. He very reliably lets me feel his love in the way he treats me and my body eventually sways for him. There's always the option for us to stop if I don't like it. There's no pressure. But once we're there I don't want to stop either. It may just be the way he is, but his HL to me feels like he's just radiating love for me. And many times I'm too scared to embrace it out of fear my body will fail us. I'm still learning. Life can get in the way too. It's easy to forget to make time for each other. It's easy to ""forget"" to do it for weeks or months. And I assume for some LLs their HL's partner's sex drive may feel intrusive, aggressive or pressuring (or may even make them feel objectified, and I've been there with an ex, but if that's truly how you feel why are you even dating them??) but at least in my case I know that a big part of it is simply that he loves me so much he desires me and I want to learn to do better and learn to keep up with him. In any case I could probably go on forever about this as well. If anyone has specific questions about anything just go ahead. I did keep it EXTREMELY short, and yeah this is already a HUGE wall of text. So there may be huge gaps of information that may be crucial that I ended up cutting out. "
104,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,"Progress, real progress",36,968uhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/968uhi/progress_real_progress/,2018-08-11 03:12:51,"The past few 4-5 days have been pretty good between me (38HLM) my wife (30LL). (*Backstory, both of us have emotional damage from past abusive relationships that is the core of our DB*). It's not the usual case on here of sudden sex out of the blue or from a talk and it will drop off to nothing again. It's the slower, more sustainable steps forward. There was a discussion about stresses, how each of us is under various amounts of stress, and how we are each dealing with it, how it manifests, and how it affects our relationship. She gets overwhelmed and wants to walk away, I get overwhelmed and just work harder and harder until I drop. We discussed how we both need to find ways to deal with the stress better, and unburden the workload. We discussed how a better discussion of priorities needed to happen. Then there was a discussion about needs. I calmly and simply asked her what she needed in life. She was tense, anxious, but slowly began listing things she knows she needs. She calmed down as she listed them, knowing I was listening and truly interested in trying to meet them. It was basic stuff. A clean house, consistent exercise, consistent meals, time away from the stresses. And then tears came to her eyes, happy tears, when I told her that I had been making assumptions about her needs, and will shift my focus and efforts to better meet what she is telling me she needs. She didn't reciprocate there, but I was unwilling to pressure her into doing so. It grated on me a bit, but she has always been able to make those internal real adjustments best when there is a stark difference, one where there is no excuses left to pin the surface reasons on. Then there was a moment when she communicated that she realized that all my hard work was because of how much I loved her, and without really getting two way communication and feedback from her, I was left trying to figure it out on my own, that it wasn't healthy. Then there was a moment where she came to me, all happy, expressing how much she loves the new open calmly communicating and closely connecting -US-. She said: ""I love this, I love how we are talking and moving forward, and you are meeting what I need and I..."" she trailed of, I could see her introspection, her realization of what she was about to say. About to say ""I am meeting what you need"", but realizing that it wasn't true. She continued in a subdued tone, one a bit nervous, ""I am making steps to try to meet yours."" She went on to say that she recognized that I had a key need that still wasn't being met, that she wasn't ignoring it, and really wanted to get it right. Not just to ""do it"", but to actually want it. Love her so much. Then yesterday I walked in on her masturbating to porn. There was an immediate issue we had to deal with unrelated to the relationship, so conversation was deferred for a bit, but then I brought it up to discuss. She admitted it, but also explained that masturbating was just for a practical need, that the endorphin release was needed for helping to clear a headache, and the porn just helped get it started. She always saw sex with me as an emotional thing, not a practical one, and it didn't feel right mixing the two. She also said that what triggered her in porn was the emotional connection in the amateur videos, the same thing that triggered it for me before I stopped porn usage. I started chuckling and she asked why I was laughing. I told her that what she presented was a logical explanation for how she approached masturbating, and her trigger in porn was identical to mine so I couldn't fault her for it, but that ""isn't how it makes me feel."" This reversal, where she has always been the emotional one, me the logical one. Irony is always a big humor trigger for me. I told her that while I understand her explanation and her perspective on porn, it is a self esteem hit for me when I'm craving that from her. I asked if she could, maybe next time, maybe a time after that, try just asking me for help to meet her 'practical need'. I love touching her, I enjoy meeting her needs, and ""I think you might be surprised at what you find emotionally."" She nodded, said ""ok"", but then a few hours later while driving mentioned: ""I think you are right. I have been separating the practical from the emotional, but I don't actually have to. I think I'm having to rediscover and redefine what sex means to me. I'm actually getting excited about it."" And later still, we had a relaxing time in the river and after we headed up to shower off, she saw I was getting turned on rapidly as she undressed, and for the first time EVER suggested we shower off together. Even before we got in the shower, she started stroking me, having fun with my body in a way she has never done before. No iota of ""duty"" felt, just ... she wanted to. It was amazing. We didn't go further. I was unwilling to add pressure to the mix, and she just seemed to be enjoying it, and the touch with positive association is plenty of progress for me. It hasn't all been roses and teacups. We have had a near-fight almost every single day, always because of the new vulnerability we have between us gets hurt from one accidental misstep or another. But always a step forward from it. It's not solved yet, but this genuinely feels like we are moving in the right direction, toward sustainable and healthy intimacy. A lot of it for me has come from here in r/DeadBedrooms. Reading things from other perspectives, pulling out key elements and lessons, understanding what I did have control over and my contribution to the problem, and what she was probably dealing with on her end. Thanks everyone."
105,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,One love language that makes all the difference.,32,96dpxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/96dpxd/one_love_language_that_makes_all_the_difference/,2018-08-11 13:55:48,"Recently there have been several posts questioning the importance of sexuality in a relationship, posed in words sharing much of the sensibilities of my used-to-be-SO. We continue to share a house and raise kids (mine from a previous marriage, and almost done), but I am working on myself and planning my next chapter. After several years of decreasing intimacy she finally came out and told me she had no interest or desire for me, and considers herself or identifies as asexual. This has caused a great deal of conflict, as she doesn't understand why 'this little aspect' would threaten our relationship (when it effectively had ended it). The whole thing makes me terribly sad and I've written a bit on this, so I thought I'd share the collection of approaches. 1. From a functional practice perspective, romantic heterosexual/homosexual/XYZ-non-zero-orientation intimacy is fundamentally physical. A nice example is that I can spend time with, cohabitate, share finances, raise children, work together, vacation together, get old together, and spend all my time talking until the wee hours of the morning every night... with my sister or brother, and no one would think that excessively weird or requiring intervention. But sex... sharing physical intimacy, being open, naked, sharing vulnerability, expressing care and communication that transcends talking... THAT is what makes an otherwise platonic relationship into a romantic one. If you won't touch me, if there is no desire, passion, or wanting... then you are offering no relationship beyond good friendship or familial love. 2. Some, including me, would say that exclusivity is a key element of a romantic relationship. If I cross that with ""5-love-languages"" as a well-rounded view of the things one can share, what makes a relationship exclusive and thus special? Gift giving? No, I give thoughtful, valuable, or high-effort gifts to many people as a mark of kindness and inclusiveness, or as a transactional repayment. Acts of service? No, the biggest recipients of acts of service are my children and elderly parents; I consider my partner to be much more of someone I act in concert with, than a recipient of service. Quality time? Somewhat more so, but I give my time and quality effort to many recipients; I read stories to my children at bedtime, I cried with my brother when his daughter was hospitalized for the umpteenth time, I sell my logical quality time as high-dollar consulting hours, and I share my feelings and thoughts of the day with my partner at home... but quality time may be more or less special, and is certainly not exclusive. Words of affirmation? Oh hell no, in fact I find that kind of irritating: ""Nice"" words or unconditionally saying supportive things and affirmation all the time -- instead of being good and constructive which sometimes means being harsh and truthful -- are a mark of shallow or fragile relationships, more than a product of deep love. But then what about physical touch? Yep, different from all others. With even basic physical touch such as hugging, we tend to be more and more selective, and as we progress deeper and more closely to sexual sharing, most people (tho not all) quickly become steadfastly exclusive to one other person. Exclusivity usually means physical intimate touch over all other things. 3. Delving further into the the idea of ""quality time"", one poster mentioned talk as a mode of intimacy, which is something that my ace/ex/friend has said several times: ""we have insightful, meaningful conversations where I feel like our souls are connected."" I find this particularly irksome, as we are both quite expressive verbal people. But -- and please forgive the self-referenced gender stereotyping -- many men perceive this absolutely opposite to a progression of intimacy. The more one talks about a situation, feelings, and relationship, the colder it gets. The maximum amount of talking might be done with a therapist, where the purpose of such thoughtful, deep, probing, voluminous talking is to depersonalize, disassemble, and diagnose with cold precision. This is, I think, the opposite of what that poster was expressing as intimacy through talk. But from this side of the fence, after a certain point so much talk murders intimacy, because it's all disassembled on the floor. ""We're not intimate _because_ all we do is talk,"" that's what I told my now-friend. Shared quiet experience and 1-on-1 nonverbal communication are what makes a connection unique or special. 4. From an identity perspective, I do respect those who identify as asexual, and their right to express themselves, and to be comfortable in their identity. But -- and it's a big BUT -- there are limits to that comfort and expression, particularly when it impinges or impedes another person's sexual identity or expression. This causes ugly conflict when one of two people in a formerly-hetero relationship determines that they are asexual, yet somehow expects or demands that their partner remain in some sort of exclusive relationship or marriage with them. This is no different than a gay man demanding his wife remain married to him after he comes out, or one of a lesbian couple expecting the other to remain committed after she unexpectedly has a child and marries the father. What's happening in each of these is that one person's identity+orientation is being squashed or subjugated by the other person's orientation. Specifically here, the other partner in a relationship is denying and invalidating my expression of partnership+intimacy, substituting their own orientation for mine, and then demanding that &gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt; accept it as valid and sufficient &gt;&gt;for me&lt;&lt;. It's depersonalizing and deeply humiliating. It's as if I'm hungry and need to consume physical food, but my partner has inexplicably decided to photosynthesize, demanding or expecting that I stand next to them but not touch anything especially them. When I start to starve they insist I should not be hungry, that sunlight and words should be enough. But I'm not a fucking potted plant. And why should I want to be? 5. What if I die? Will I be loved after I'm gone? One poster asserted intimacy isn't a necessary or unique part of a relationship because love transcends death, that after the death of a partner an aching heart in old age proves the point. But that's loneliness and loss, and joy from the memory of chapters that are now fully written, not love itself. And if I'm in a relationship that causes me to be that kind of lonely, or loving the past -- while the person still stands next to me still living and breathing -- something is terribly, terribly wrong. And even in long-distance affairs where the romance is conducted entirely by letter and voice? Do those letters and calls not always revolve around wanting to be together? Show me a box full of letters between two sane lovers who remain apart yet write ""yeah, this is good, let's stick with this"" and I'll eat my hat. I'm off to a pool party with a bunch of LGBTQ friends, who tho most of them want nothing from me, will at least share a hug. Because touch is a goddamn important part of being human. my $0.02."

Im looking for any thoughts and advice to help me make further strides in my marriage. Im the LL (M43) in the relationship with F (39). Overall relationship is generally good, we've been married over 16 years with kids that we love. Sex has been a sensitive subject for most of our marriage. We still have sex regularly (about once a week), but it's an emotional sore spot for both of us. She likes it more often; Im not against doing it more often, but as the LL it takes more effort for me to initiate during the week. We both have trust issues, but different versions. On top of that she is more extroverted while Im rather introverted. As an introvert I struggle expressing sexual desire or communicating sexual wants. The bottomline is she does not feel desired and I fear vulnerability initiating sex. Below are the major issues that I feel affect me along with some of the positives. Any thoughts or inputs to help me figure out how to be a better partner and get past my issues is greatly appreciated; books, movies, blogs, activities (Recently read Come as You Are and currently reading Mating in Captivity, I've also read Sex at Dawn within the last year) My issues * Dont express general sexual desire, or at least limited to a very small window during sex * Dont put effort into romance prior to sex whether days or hours prior * Not very romantic when initiating sex * Typically dont send clear signals when initiating sex * Regularly send mixed signals when being sexual and silly but not actually initiating (I assume she knows Im just goofing around and not initiating sex) * Fear of the vulnerability of initiating sex: * Knowing I have not put in any effort in romance prior (days or hours) * Knowing I have not followed through on promises: bringing up sex conversations or reading books consistently or initiating more clearly * Knowing that my behavior in the past has caused pain and hurt for her; its like I fear reminder her of the pain even though I know she wants it * Fear that its boring because is the same old wake up on the weekend, roll over and do it The good * I like sex, I genuinely get turned on when she gets turned on * I love my wife and am definitely attracted to her * We do at least talk about our issues, thought she is still better at initiating the conversations. We both want to resolve things * We have sex, but it's still tied to hurt feelings * Were generally on the same page in terms of what we like when having sex, neither of us have a fetish that bothers the other * She wants to please me and I want to please her"

The stroking motions appear to be loving as with a child or a dog; but they're not - they're just physical pressure seeking release. I get no feelings kick out of any aspect of it whatsoever. Never did. And I want to forget the vulnerability on both sides as soon as it's done. I understand and sometimes follow the advice saying 'do it for her if she asks', but it still feels hollow, like small talk. Just an insight on a phenomenon I see misinterpreted all the time."

Not wanting to subject a potential romantic partner to the burden of my mental health ended a lot of the relationships I was in before they could really start. I would make the conscious decision to forgo emotional and physical intimacy for the calculated safety of knowing I could hide my issues if I didn't embrace the vulnerability of letting your guard down as you get to know someone. I still had a libido, I still had desires, I was just too scared of everything that came with it. I had friendships and dated socially and many of those friendships were with women, friendships I still have today. For some reason sex just never really happened. And I find myself soon to be 27 years old without having had sex. 2 years ago I decided to seek help, and 2 years of therapy and months of medication I finally feel like I am healthy and happy and normal. But the Antidepressants I'm on have really done a number to my sexual desire. I was wondering if anyone on this subreddit has experience with a healthy sex life while on antidepressant and anti anxiety medication? I am finally healthy enough to have healthy relationships but I feel less physically ready to have them."
109,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,As normal myexsparamour has come up with the answer!!!!! - Persuer / distancer relationship,29,8lc3pb,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/8lc3pb/as_normal_myexsparamour_has_come_up_with_the/,2018-05-23 04:01:42,"first of all shout out to /u/myexsparamour for being her wonderful self and being able to to put a name to what the entire problem in my relationship is Pursuer-Distancer Pattern Relationship I think this is something A LOT of us are dealing with but I have never been actually able to understand it or put a name to it until she posted a link on a thread earlier &gt;A partner with **pursuing** behavior tends to respond to relationship stress by moving toward the other. They seek communication, discussion, togetherness, and expression. They are urgent in their efforts to fix what they think is wrong. They are anxious about the distance their partner has created and take it personally.They criticize their partner for being emotionally unavailable. They believe they have superior values. If they fail to connect, they will collapse into a cold, detached state. They are labeled needy, demanding, and nagging. &gt;A partner with **distancing** behavior tends to respond to relationship stress by moving away from the other. They want physical and emotional distance. They have difficulty with vulnerability. They respond to their anxiety by retreating into other activities to distract themselves. They see themselves as private and self-reliant. They are most approachable when they dont feel pressured, pushed, or pursued. They are labeled unavailable, withholding, and shut down. I am a persuer and it feels like I always have been - it has caused me a lot of stress and distress over the years and finally being able to recognise it has been amazing and like a beam of light shining down on me in one of those movie epiphany moments Generally the female in the relationship is the persuer for emotional needs and the distancer for sexual needs and vice versa for the males - the weird thing in my relationship is that I am the persuer for both and my partner is the distancer for both &gt;Nowhere is the pursuer-distancer dance more keenly (and painfully) felt than in the bedroom. This is because the pattern develops often as a by-product of desire discrepancy. After the honeymoon phase of a relationship is over, differing levels of sexual desire or interest between partners inevitably emerge. Some couples work out helpful ways to get their needs met despite a desire mismatch and, as a result, manage to keep their relationship relatively harmonious. However for many couples differing sex drives lead to misunderstanding, bitter disputes and ongoing unhappiness. &gt;Typically the partner with the higher sex drive interprets the others lesser desire as indifference while the less interested partner interprets the others stronger desire as selfishness and insensitivity. If not managed well, what might have begun as a small difference in sexual interest develops into an all out power struggle which puts the relationship at stake. *The sexual pursuer* The more sexually interested partner becomes the sexual pursuer. Pursuing behaviours usually take the form of frequent sexual initiation, nagging and relentlessly pressuring for sex. When their sexual demands are not met, pursuers typically become upset and resentful, often complaining angrily about the lack of sex. Some sulk or have tantrums, while others react with hostility. In extreme cases, emotional and physical abuse ensues. Pursuers typically blame their partner for the problem, regarding her level of sex drive as abnormally low and labelling her as frigid. Pursuers usually believe that the problem can be solved by their partner providing more sex. Underlying much of a pursuers behaviours are feelings of hurt and rejection as many equate sex with love. *The sexual distancer* Distancers find ways to avoid having sex and end up also avoiding their partner. They are careful of physical contact and affection just in case touching is perceived as an invitation to have sex. Distancers will go to bed earlier or stay up later than their partners and also avoid being seen naked in order to sidestep anything that might be viewed as a sexual opportunity. Another common way for distancers to maintain distance from the pursuer and his demands is to immerse themselves in work, hobbies or other activities. Compared with the emotional reactivity of pursuers, distancers usually display a calmer exterior and appear to be in more control. Yet distancers are also undergoing emotional turmoil. Although they typically feel resentful and angry by their partners sexual demands, they may also feel inadequate, guilty, and anxious. Many long for affection and physical closeness but are unwilling to take the risk of initiating touch in case its misread as an invitation to have sex. This is just the start for me - i need to do lots more research and work on myself and my partner is on board as well - he is actually reading the articles and agreeing with me that this is exactly what our relationship is Any thoughts, feelings, comments, links or anything else - please discuss!

110,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Sex therapy &amp; adult playtime update,338,8mvxa0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/8mvxa0/sex_therapy_adult_playtime_update/,2018-05-29 13:27:24,"I havent been on here in a while because things are going really well! Going to a sex therapist really helped our relationship! Committing to adult playtime 1x a week has also been so amazing. Ive learned more about my partner and how to be a better partner myself in the last couple months than I learned in the past 11 yrs together! Here are some takeaways: 1. You cant have a yes without a no...my therapist said I need to respect a no (in regards to sex) and not let it ruin what can still be a great, intimate and even fun, time. 2. We must commit to one night a week of adult playtime, which can take many forms. The purpose is to encourage intimacy and build trust so that there can be more freedom and vulnerability. Sometimes its showering together, sometimes is just talking, sometimes its just cuddling while watching tv, but it must happen! 3. My partner isnt 16, and neither am I...I have learned that he really needs quite a bit of buildup sometimes in order to get in the mood. Me hopping on top of him and saying lets do it...isnt going to get him going...(although it has worked now that this aspect of our relationship is changing). 4. I cannot take everything so personally!! If hes not in the mood, its not about me, its about him...Im sure you can see how this extends into various areas. 5. I thought I wanted more sex, but after carefully examining the relationship and working on things, Ive come to realize that often times I just want more physical touch, and I dont really need sex the way I thought I did when I wasnt getting it too often. I hope that some of this info is helpful to even just one person! This reddit website has been sooo helpful and Im very appreciate of many of you who have bared your souls in your posts. "

I'll do a quick copy paste in the comment below if anyone wants to read it, but she really hurt me. She said that if I really loved her, I would respect her boundaries (of no penetration, no head, no kink, no romantic dancing, no long kissing, etc), and stop trying. And I told her that I've been up front since the beginning that I wasn't really satisfied and needed thing to change. Nothing ever changed. It wasn't about time or being patient, she just exclusively likes external stimulation, and her emotional baggage prevents her from doing a lot of intimate things. I tried everything I could think of, and tried just external stimulation for ages because it was all I could get. It's not even that she has a low sex drive. She has quite a bit of sex drive, she just has one exclusive like, and it's not compatible with me. **The worst part is that her take on it is this**: I don't love and don't respect her for saying that I have physical and emotional need related to sex and intimacy. I need the love, acceptance, vulnerability, and freedom of expression that comes with sexual compatibility. It's a real shame, and I'm hugely disappointed, and really, really sad, but I'm not going to sign up for a long term relationship where I'm left unsatisfied. "
112,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,So hot and cold...,14,8fjwqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/8fjwqo/so_hot_and_cold/,2018-04-28 23:34:24,"Ive noticed that there is no in between with me and my husband. Im either burning for him or cant stand him. Is this just pregnancy or a typical DB dynamic? I realized last night Ive been feeling pretty again. Maybe its the warm weather, or the awareness that I still get looked at by random strangers, or reading posts in here confirming my suspicions that its all in my head and my waning self esteem is a result of sexual rejection...not something inherently wrong with me or my changing body. Almost two years of prenatal vitamins have left me with glowing skin and long, healthy hair. Id just had a bath and was clean, shaven, and smelled good. I was still naked and as I looked in the mirror, I liked what I saw and thought simply, Id do me. (SPOILER ALERT: Thats exactly what ended up happening..,) So I went and laid down for the night, wearing nothing but thin little panties. As the hours ticked by I grew frustrated but eventually my husband came to bed. I immediately turned toward him and softly stroked his head and touched his leg while he pretended to be so sleepy and blathered on about shit neither of us care about. He pretended not to notice I was hot and bothered and patted me dismissively on the thigh as he tried to avoid addressing my growing exasperation. Finally I rolled my eyes, sighed loudly and rolled over. He asked me, in his usual condescending way, if I was angry because we werent having sex. You know the answer to that. was my reply. Them I had to listen to his tired old list of excuses. As I picked them apart he grew angry and decided to necromance a small argument wed had fourteen hours earlier and focus on something Id said that put him off. I waited an appropriate amount of time and then quietly walked over to my drawer and pulled out a sex toy, went to another room, and took care of myself. After Id finished, I was hit with the familiar urge to clothe myself despite being flushed from multiple orgasms. Something about his rejections always makes me want to put as much distance between him and myself as possible. Its a dirty, panicky feeling. (Ive done everything from hop in my car and drive away, to bundle up in clothing, to sleeping in a different room, to locking myself in the shower for hours.) But I couldnt because I hadnt grabbed any clothing on the way out. I had to re-enter my bedroom wearing only the panties that Id been so confident in just hours before. I was creeped out to realize he was still awake, and he started asking me to do menial stuff as soon as I got back in the room. I inarticulaty mumbled for him to wait as I desperately grasped for clothing in the dark. Must cover up. I ended up sleeping on a different bed mattress in the same room. And we argued, at which point he became angry and tried to lord the sex withholding thing over me, as in: Maybe if you didnt do blah blah blah Id wanna have sex with you. I told him to get over himself, I could fuck anyone I want. (Real mature, I know. But I was disgusted by his arrogance.) Anyway I slept well, which I usually dont after those fights. I dont think he realizes how, each time I disengage, the distance between us gets further and more difficult to close. Ive even been thinking about the way his aversion to my pregnant body has me not wanting him in the room when I go into labor. It would piss him off to no end but if he is so repulsed by me when I feel beautiful and confident, why would I want him in there giving me anxiety in my moments of vulnerability? Sorry for rambling. TL; DR - Sometimes I lust for my husband but more and more Im starting to be disgusted by him. There seems to be no middle ground."

Of course I (41 HLM)know what she (48 LLF)meant and of course I agreed. I tried not to act anxious or inhibited but of course I was inside. We held each other for a bit kissed a littlehavent kissed her in over a month and for even longer when we did it was always pecks. She guided me inside her and I basically had sex with a doll. She didnt move a lot, no verbal cues that she was enjoying anything. I tried to enjoy it, to try and remember why I was missing this so bad but underneath I knew i just wanted to finish. After I did she mentioned I should change my shirtbecause it was sweatyand we didnt really hug or lay with each other. She got up and said, its like we never stopped. I figured sex can be weird sometimes and maybe more so after you spend a year not doing it, but that was weird. Im not upset. It wasnt good. For me. Or her I imagine. But now, the last 5 days, it feels like she has pulled so far away from me. She will not put herself in a position to be within a touching  vicinity. She has been sleeping in a separate room. She barely asks about my day. She looks down at the floor, at her phone. And I realized that this has been the common theme in our struggles this entire time. When she would give a little to me like some vulnerability or a warm hug, its like she had to follow it up with an overreaction of the opposite. To pull away hard. But now that it was sex, well I guess I should be basically ignored for a whole week. Is this a control issue? Or maybe she realizes she doesnt want to have sex with me any more and tried it anyway, but now feels disgusted. Do any of your SOs do this? To pull away even harder after they decided to engage again? One thing is for sure, this shit is for the birds and I truly cant do it much longer"

A doctor I used to work with over 10 years ago reached out to me on LinkedIn and said he has a job opportunity for me. It would only be part time, but he was offering me pretty good money for only 12-18 hours a week to do billing for his moonlighting job. He sees patients at residential facilities and he can't use the biller in his office because his moonlighting job is not affiliated with the practice. This doctor and I used to hang out all the time and we used to have so much fun, but he was 9 years older than me and only once or twice did he make small passes at me. I was so attracted to him, but I came to the conclusion that he just enjoyed my company and he was never going to be with me. Plus, he's a life-long bachelor who would never marry. I made it clear that marriage was I wanted. We never held hands or made out... one time he danced with me and one time he put me on his lap, but denied me when I tried to kiss him. I never tried anything after that, but we would still hang out. It wasn't until I met my husband is when we stopped seeing each other. I haven't seen this doctor since my wedding day. He calls me on the way to his office and asks me if I want anything from Starbucks and I tell him I don't want anything I'm doing low-carb right now. He said, ""okay, see you soon."" I had to go in to his office to get a laptop, so that I can bill from home at night and I only need to go into his office on Monday's to give him updates. Monday is the only day I can get my mom to watch the kids for me. When I got to the office, he introduced me to his colleagues and then we went into his office to talk about work-related things I suppose. We were talking and then out of no where he starts asking questions about my marriage. Which threw me for a loop. I told him everything was fine and he knew I was lying. He hands me the laptop then pulls me in and says, ""let me take you out to dinner... I've missed you so much."" I almost fainted. I can't remember the last time I've been held that tight before. I said, ""I don't think I can go to dinner with you. I'm married with kids, hisname"" Then he says that he's sorry and says, ""I hope you won't reconsider the offer to help me out."" The big pickle is I need this job right now. The second pickle is that I can't even think straight. 1. He's never been married and he's 45 years old 2. I don't know why he's doing this... and has he done this before with someone else? 3. Can he sense my vulnerability? 4. Please don't fuck with my head right now! 5. It feels good to be desired even if it's just bs. 6. Did my husband pay him to set me up... doubtful, but part of me is confused. "
115,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Its been a crazy two months,2,7ybml2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/7ybml2/its_been_a_crazy_two_months/,2018-02-18 14:03:03,"So, when I posted my farewell, somebody asked me to keep you guys posted about what the ""real world"" was like outside of my DB. I think, if I saw this story from any other account, I'd've considered it trolling. Let's see.. where shall we start this story? In February of 2017, my therapist kissed me. In the middle of a session. (*Ethics, counselor?*) It really messed me up, but it **also** sparked a huge rush of libido. I'd gone 16 years of DB at that point, with 1 sexual interlude per calendar year the preceding couple of years. Sex wasn't the only issue in the marriage; there were significant communication issues and lack of vulnerability with each other. But, this kiss with my therapist reminded me just how important the rush of sexual attraction **is** to me. Once I'd gotten out of the crazy whirl of emotions I was feeling towards the counselor (*in lust, infatuated, and violated at the same time?*) I settled down and flew straight .. but began developing a romantic attraction to an e-mail correspondent, Elle. She detected it and gave me a gentle bip on the nose, just enough to remind me that it was inappropriate. In December, I met this cam model from Romania .. who pretty much took me immediately off of her camsite and onto to Skype. We spent hours, there, chatting, and videochatting. She would finish a ""shift"" a the cam studio, and come back and spend another couple hours with me. I'm sure somebody's ""romance scam!"" warnings trigger on this, but that's my business. There wasn't a penny exchanged, and there were reasons for mutual trust. In particular, she helped me learn about boundaries, learn the difference between giving and sacrificing, and develop the backbone that I needed to finally stand up to my LL wife and say ""No"". What I gave to her was a nonjudgmental ear, advice of somebody with more experience, and a romantic fantasy life. I separated from my wife in January. By Jan. 31st, I was on a plane to Bucharest. While I didn't expect sex on a first date, I did expect some form of physical intimacy, but she felt very stand-offish. Not quite what I expected, but maybe its a cultural difference? No. On the third day I was there, she informed me that she's a touch-averse, sex-repulsed asexual - not that she knew the English words for these things! So, unlike the many other posters who have given us a ""come on in, the water's fine!"", I'm afraid I have to say ""I've traded one DB for another."" Though, in this instance, I think I'm much more content about it, for two simple reasons: * She was up front about it * She isn't tying me to a monogamy vow Honesty. Honesty makes such a big difference! Its also caused me to learn a lot about three things which I think may play more into our collective DB's than I had expected them to. First, /r/asexuality - for those unaware, an asexual is a person who does not feel sexual attraction to anyone. An asexual may still enjoy sex, but is unlikely to initiate, and would probably rather do any number of other things than have sex. A pairing of an HL with an asexual, especially the pairing of an HL whose primary Love Language is Touch, would be a very unhappy pairing for both. [The asexual spectrum](URL also defines a **very** specific form of asexuality, which seems like it describes my STBX-wife to a T: &gt; **Freysexual/ Freyromantic:** When someone is sexually / romantically attracted to those they are less familiar with but after a while the ""excitement"" of meeting the new person dies down and they are perfectly content with just being friends. When my wife and I met, there was a ton of sexual and romantic attraction between us, but by the second year it was waning, and by the third year on, it was very slim. I suspect that ""freysexual"" describes her perfectly. There are other options: &gt; **Acespike/ Arospike:** When someone usually doesnt feel sexual attraction but occasionally rapidly skyrockets into intense attraction, then plummets down to asexuality again. &gt; &gt; **Greysexual/ Greyromantic:** When someone only feels sexual/ romantic attraction rarely. This term can also be a general term for identifying as somewhere on the aro/ace spectrum. &gt; &gt; **Requeissexual/Requeromantic:** When someone feels limited or no sexual/romantic attraction/interest/activity due to some form of emotional exhaustion or trauma. I wonder how many of our LL's fall into those four categories? If so, then there is no singular ""fix-all"" appropriate for the general DB problem. Finally, my new partner also experienced some severe trauma from childhood, which puts her squarely in /r/cptsd. In this case, the combination of trauma and anxiety about it really make her gunshy around men: an LDR with a ""safe"" gentleman is about the most risky thing she can countenance. Now, in reading about the general category of responses to sexual trauma, it turns out that hypersexuality and asexuality are both common symptoms, and that in fact many patients alternate between one and the other. It certainly fits for my wife, who had sexual trauma in her teens: I'd describe her as hypersexual when I met her and asexual by the end of the relationship. So ... out of the DB into a D(LDR)? For now, I'm going to treat this partnership as a safe space for me to learn how to love and express love in nonsexual ways, without the baggage that trying to learn how to do that in my marriage had. It also suits me to spend some time finding my own two feet post-divorce, and this relationship will keep my mind off of the dating scene for a time while I do that. For bonus ""life is strange"" points, when I came home from Bucharest a week later, I met Elle in person for the first time. I described my experiences, and Elle says, ""Oh, did I ever tell you, I'm Ace?"" *Yes, yes I did manage to find myself attracted to* **two** *asexuals in my first two tries outside of my marriage!* "

And often I struggle to reply to those posts because I have this chip on my shoulder. I made a post months ago, on my last account, about ""deserving"" sex.

I know part of me still sees sex as this ultimate thing-- I've been sexually active since 18 and it's only been a two or three years ago that, during sex, I wasn't thinking, ""whoa...you are actually having sex...this is weird..."" Because my religious upbringing taught me sex was this ultimately special and magical thing that should be saved for just one person, yadda, yadda, vomit. And I totally bought into it. I also believe my attitude is reflected in the LL spouses of regular posters here--- this twisted thinking about sex being deserved. My husband triggered it in me a bit a month or so ago when I was making a move for oral and he said, ""oh, but I wanted to have sex,"" and inside my head I was like, ""oh, well, la-di-da..."" "
117,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,What happens now??,9,7sy973,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/7sy973/what_happens_now/,2018-01-26 05:41:41,"We went on our trip last week and it played out exactly as I thought it would. No sex - she would be tired one day, stomach another, and some other excuse the the third night. That did not stop me. I had a good enough time and we had some fierce conversations. What she wanted over the next few months, what was stressing her out, what was she enjoying most, etc. She asked me the same. We had a good time discussing things, shared laughs. Overall, no real change led to my belief this is over. Yesterday, I decided to try to initiate using the role play that she started the last time to see where it would go. Joked around in the morning, went to lunch together, and when we got home I told her (after commenting back to the role play of her being my secretary) that her priority for the afternoon was doing me. She kind of played along, but eventually started the fight pulling the role play comment into the real world saying I dont tell her what her priorities are (again, I did that in a role play). And then followed with excuses. I walked away and said we are always busy we have a choice to make what we want happen. And shut the door to my office. She came in and started in. Talked about her lack of attraction (why I believe she is), the fact I wanted to wait for marriage vs wanting a lot post marriage, how much sex we both feel is ideal, scheduling, how unhealthy our sex life is, how I wouldnt always want it if we had it a lot more, how I want the focus during sex to be different at different times (sometimes just me, sometimes just her,, sometimes both), and how sex is vulnerability/passion/closeness not an act. Talked about my performance anxiety that I have now. All of which we talked about before. Two things we never did - i asked her if she wanted to open up the marriage (our counselor asked us and I flat out said no and my wife did as well, but we never talked about it privately) and I asked her why she feels being angry and negative can be a priority over her work, but connecting and being intimate she cant? She went on about standing up for herself to which I told her if it was just that it would have been two seconds and over. At the time of this discussion, she was sitting on my lap. She then stood up and asked about this oral dictation I wanted her to take (yes, it was a reference to the text I sent her in the morning - telling her that I need my secretary to take some dic-tation). And she starts following through on the role play. Her actually engaging in the role play from tired not interested is new. Make up sex is new. What we did was different. I make no claims we are fixed or that this not hysterical bonding. I also make no claims that I am not talking to a lawyer. I am actively looking for one. Hoping to meet up with one by the end of the month or early February. 2x in one month, after 28 months without... Would love to hear thoughts. "
118,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Anyone else become okay with a dead bedroom?,5,7uhzm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/7uhzm0/anyone_else_become_okay_with_a_dead_bedroom/,2018-02-01 21:59:33,"So, I realise this is probably controversial but let me muse... My partner of four years has an extremely low libido, ed issues, and a general unease about sex. His drive is so low that he has proclaimed that if he never had sex again, it would be fine with him. This used to confuse me because I have a high libido and can't imagine a life without the deep, beautiful connection that emotional and sexual vulnerability offers. But maybe that's not the end of the world after all? His attitude towards sex hurt me for a long while. However I've come to a place where it actually feels quite loving. Ive always had men interested in me for sex and how I look. But, he loves me for who I am without sex. He is committed to me for me. We are very affectionate and if I ask for sex he will always oblige.. Although I've stopped asking because I started to feel a bit predatory after I realised he's probably asexual. Sometimes I wish he would just spring it on me and I wish I felt less nervous about jumping his bones at will... For a long time it's broken my heart. I love sex. I'd love it at least daily. But somewhere in this I have found a deeper love with him. I love our hour + every day of cuddles in bed without the pressure and expectation. I love him utterly. As a result, ive relaxed so much that I am confident in myself like never before. I am totally confident with my body and never wear makeup anymore. He responds to me with love no matter how I look. No matter what I do it don't do for him sexually. There's no sexual pressure. If I don't shave my legs he still kisses and holds me like I'm the only woman on earth. He is loyal to a fault and sexy as hell. Have I stumbled upon an ultimate love that I've always craved in the midst of this pain or am I in denial about this? I love him more, suddenly, because of his low libido and our lack of intimacy. How did this happen!?"

120,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,"HLs - do any of you feel that youre primarily responsible for the DB, whether you admit it to your partner or not? In what ways does fault matter?",7,7v4ceb,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/7v4ceb/hls_do_any_of_you_feel_that_youre_primarily/,2018-02-04 14:30:25,"Hi guys. Ive been pouring through this subreddit for hours at a time since last week - nearly unable to set my phone down. It includes some of the most eye-opening, insightful, and gut-wrenching reading material that Ive ever had the honor of laying eyes on, so thank you all. Im a 38 year old LLF and my HL husband is the same age. Weve been married for almost 4 years and living together in a committed relationship for over a decade . We also share a 3 year old daughter. Id estimate that weve had a DB situation going on for the past 7 years or so, but within the last 2-3 years our marital issues have expanded and worsened in their severity to the point that Ive visited a divorce attorney for a consultation. Although logically I realize that its not at all constructive I continually feel this overwhelming need to understand whos fault the whole thing is. Now, please realize that by fault I dont mean malice- I dont believe that my husband is intentionally trying to hurt me, and I would certainly never do that to him. Im aware that it takes two to tango, and I readily admit to being a shitty partner in this respect for a loooooong time. He deserved to feel wanted and to enjoy the physical pleasure and release of an orgasm on a far more frequent basis. I take responsibility for not doing nearly enough to try and solve the problem when It began. I understand that I failed him in many ways, but please.....hear me out. My husband has been sporadically cheating on me for many years, probably since the start of our relationship. (though he denies it began that early on. ) For the first 3 or 4 years of our relationship we had what I felt was a very mutually satisfying sex life, and if he didnt share that sentiment he certainly never said so. We had sex nearly every time the opportunity arose, we were even active in the lifestyle (swinging), and we had FUN together in bed. We were very much in love, too. He scored his dream job across the country, and I didnt hesitate to go with him. Then - about a year later - I discovered that almost every night while I was away at work he would go online and peruse the casual encounters section of Craigs list, often corresponding with potential hook-ups via email or text, and occasionally meeting them in person. Hed kept all of that from me for a year or more, and Id had no idea. NONE. Id had no reason to believe he wasnt satisfied and my trust in him was shattered. At that time he was profusely apologetic - expressing remorse, shame, and a commitment to change. He cried and told me he thought there was something wrong with him...that he wanted to be better for me. I think I loved him more because of those moments of vulnerability. We promised to figure it out together, whatever it was. It didnt go away. But you know what did? Yep. Slowly....insidiously, my libido all but slipped away. I stopped feeling excited when we were alone together. It got to the point where Id need to get drunk and really psych myself up for the event. He could sense the change, he later told me. It just got progressively worse- less and less frequent - but oddly other areas of our relationship seemed to be thriving. I began to feel safe with him again. I thought (I prayed) that those animalistic urges that I used to have to devour every aspect of him would follow suit, and it was around that time we decided to have a child together and get married. We were not prepared for parenthood-it hit us both extremely hard and I especially did not adjust particularly well to the demands. Around the time Id returned to work following maternity leave I was hit with traumatic infidelity discovery #2 - that hed never really stopped at all. That was about 3 years ago. The only thing about his behavior thats changed since then is that he doesnt apologize for his behavior anymore - not the lies, not the disregard for my feelings or boundaries. None of it. I dont trust him because hes proven to me over and over again that I shouldnt. When confronted about his secrets I get some version of, yeah, well I need to get laid sometimes.. I even educated myself on open relationships, came to terms with my own hang ups about it, and offered that arrangement as a potential solution. I felt guilty and sad that I didnt want to have sex with him- I wanted us to be happy again. It never worked out because he refused to agree on or adhere to any sort of guidelines, and the lies continued. The fact that he cant admit when hes screwed up, take responsibility, and offer a genuine apology for anything anymore has all but turned me off completely when it comes to him. I felt as though hes afraid to be vulnerable around me anymore. He blames everything on me, and continues to this day to insist that everything hes ever done in secret and lied to me about is a result of some deficit of mine. I need to feel like Im not crazy....because I feel like Im being gaslighted in the most f-ed up way imaginable. Im starting to doubt my own instincts. Also, I may have a LL , but - I HATE THIS DEAD BEDROOM. I want nothing more than a sexual experience that leaves me feeling pursued, lusted after, treasured, LOVED. Cared about. Fawned over. Is this my fault??"

Part of me wants it to be brutally honest with possible crippling consequences (bottled up anger, resentment and feelings of revenge). But then I channel the inner Mother Teresa and she suggests a more merciful approach with lots of vaseline and organic Coconut Oil to soothe any emotional boo boos that might result. Then there's just leaving and not saying much except my own personalized version of ""Bye Felicia"". Whichever I end up deciding will get the job done but I feel the nice approach might be the riskiest, exposing me to vulnerability, pity or whatever manipulative tactic he will come up with. At this point it'd be great if we remained friends (we run a non-profit together) but I am ok with whatever. Any advice is greatly appreciated."

I suspect that we're more than a little overrepresented on this forum.** tl;dr: Avoiding sex is a form of emotional cutoff, and can be mediated by raising or lowering LLs anxiety level. In a relationship, both partners are balancing the need to feel close with the need for self protection (limiting vulnerability). If you've already left your SO, please just leave and don't down-vote. This may not apply to you because your narcissist crazy lazy hazy douchbag of a former partner could not be changed no matter what you did, but there are plenty of geeks who need to get laid and can use this info to get there. They have been made fun of, and ridiculed, and made to feel unworthy of love and sex their whole life. Don't make it worse by taking away their only chance at getting some action in the near future. --- This is a collection of links to help you understand the science behind your DB, and what you can do about it. The basic idea is that cutting off sex is a form of *emotional cutoff* or *distancing* behaviour that is undertaken by LL as they attempt to balance their need for closeness with their need for self-protection from feeling vulnerable and getting hurt. LL unconsciously blocks their own natural desire when they are feeling too close, and when they perceive that they would be too hurtful if they were to lose you. --- There are two situations in which LL is likely to abandon their self-protective distancing strategy and get back to seeking closeness (sex): * **Raise Anxiety: Increase their perceived risk of you leaving** * Breakup, or create the impression that a breakup is imminent * Improve yourself and your attractiveness to the point that they feel inferior and fear that you will ""trade up"" to a new partner * Lower LLs self-esteem using negative feedback, insults, and ""putting them in their place"" * Stop pursuing sex. Note that it is not the lack of pursuit that is important, but LLs impression that you no longer desire sex. If LL thinks that you have stopped initiating for the purpose of trying to get LL to start chasing, then this can last forever. LL will only start chasing when they fully believe that you no longer desire sex with them. This is a terrible strategy since in most cases, LL implicitly knows that HL always wants sex, so this just leads to a long dry spell. * Using emotional cutoff (anger, resentment, and withdrawal of affection) to decrease closeness and remove the need for self-protective behavious * **Lower Anxiety: Decrease LLs perceived risk that you will leave** * Provide consistent and reliable reassurance that you love them and they are desirable * Provide reassurance that you view them as an adequate and capable partner; that they are doing a good job of giving you what you need in a relationship * Increase non-sexual affection and displays of love * Reassure them that you are consistently available to them to meet their needs for affection, both sexual and non-sexual * Raise their self esteem by providing external validation of their self worth (telling them they are beautiful, loveable, and competent in all aspects of their life) while also introducing them to the concept of self-validation and encouraging them to adopt self-validation as their primary source of self worth. --- Note that the first option, while somewhat effective, is abusive in nature, and should be avoided. It will eventually raise anxiety on both sides to intolerable levels and facilitate an explosive end to the relationship. The second strategy, while more difficult, is the preferred way to escape your DB. But it requires developing your own self-validated sense of self-worth and self-esteem so you can stop letting sensitivity to rejection push you toward your own self-protective distancing actions (emotional withdrawal rather than sexual withdrawal). It requires first understanding the concept of differentiation of self, and working toward raising your level of differentiation (aka emotional maturity). ""The Happiness Trap"" by Russ Harris introduces the core concepts of [Acceptance and Commitment Therapy -- ACT](URL that can help you actually implement some of the core concepts of differentiation and self-esteem maintenance. --- The core idea behind this post can be found in this paper: [Balancing Connectedness and Self-Protections Goals in Close Relationships](URL --- The following links can help you evaluate where you are, and where you should be heading if you want to get back to having sex: These self-surveys can provide good insight into what a healthy (and sex filled) relationship looks like.

So, for most of my life I've been single. Dated around a bit but mostly just hooked up with people or had FWB's. I definitely had issues with vulnerability and intimacy so stayed away from it. I also put sex on a pedestal and was sort of sex crazy, though I wouldn't call myself an addict. My libido has always been very high, I regularly would masturbate multiple times a day, have crazy sex, most guys couldn't keep up with me, and I was told my many men how I was the best they'd ever had, etc. Though I wasn't aware of it at the time of course, I'm pretty sure I derived much of the pleasure from sex from making the other person feel good because it validated my self-worth and made me feel powerful. I definitely have spent a lot of my life trying to please other people as a way to gain validation because I couldn't give it to myself. I used sex as a tool to feel powerful, though ironically all I was doing was giving away my own power. Anyway, fast forward to years of therapy and a lot of work on myself and I'm in a relationship with an amazing human who is caring and sensitive. And I feel bored, have a hard time getting aroused or feeling in the mood for sex ever. We haven't been together very long (6-8 months ish) so I don't think it's just that we've gotten into a rut. His penis is on the smaller side for what I'm used to and I've previously always been a size queen. I would automatically lose my attraction if I was hooking up with a guy who had a penis on the smaller size. He's definitely not small small, like 5"" with a decent girth but I usually prefer 6.5-8inches with a solid girth. In my head, I blamed his penis size for awhile for my disinterest but I don't think that's it. He's able to use it well and it does feel good for the most part when we have sex. I am pretty sure the reason I'm not getting turned on is because this feels safe and secure and that feels boring in my head. I feel so bad for both him and myself and desperately want to fix this! How do I get myself to believe that safe, emotionally connective sex can and is hot?? TL;DR: Used to have a lot of sex, got into a solid relationship for the first time in my life and all of a sudden have zero libido. How do I convince my brain that safe, emotionally connective sex is hot??"
124,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,LL Male: some more stuff,7,7m12i7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/7m12i7/ll_male_some_more_stuff/,2017-12-25 23:03:13,"A couple of days ago I posted my thoughts about my experience as an LL M. Quick TLDR: turned on easily, but finding sex itself offputting , and disliking what for me is the aimless nature of the act. Got comments saying: thanks, this is new; also saying: you're probably autistic; you may need another partner or another kink; and you can't be both horny and LL. All fair and good. I appreciate the time you took. Two replies, in ascending order of significance. 1) Autism, 'wrong partner', 'wrong kink', and the mystery of being a horny LL. I may indeed be borderline PDD. Or not. The neuro background makes very little difference: my personality is what it is, whether there is a DSM name for it or not. Partner: she's doing her best. My guess is if she was a better 'toucher' (and idem if I would find a better turn-on), that would make the whole thing totally unbearable. It's the vulnerability aspect and lack of clear body borders that make it stressful and causes the grossing out - not the sounds or scents or textures. So yes, one can look at women and have pants-piercing erections while being absolutely averse to actual sex because one doesn't want to have someone that physically close while playing a pointless game. People's motivations are often contradictory. Life is complex. 2) More serious stuff. This is largely an HL forum and much of the volume is about cracking the LL code. After subtracting illness and dysfunction, cheating, control issues, passive aggression, tacit anger and maybe just confusion, you're left with a certain constituency of LLs who fit none of the above. They may be otherwise good partners. They may even be good lovers. But they're not into it. I tried to describe one variant from the inside. If you think with me instead of trying to explain me away, perhaps you get some LL behavior. You don't need to endorse or legitimize. E.g., there's a recurring theme in some stories here. An HL, typically female, would say: he's a good partner, and when we have sex it's great, but it's too rare for me. Replies usually try to console or advise. Nowhere have I seen anyone raising this question: if the experience was good, why isn't the partner interested in repeating it? If it was me, I'd reply: precisely because it was good. It replenished the sexual credit balance. Now I can rest for longer. Sex is an obligation: it means putting on a mask for a while and pretending to be where I'm not. I can never be there because being that close would kill me as a person. You get this, perhaps you get some apparent LLs you run into."
125,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,How to adjust your partners libido,8,7pqgju,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/7pqgju/how_to_adjust_your_partners_libido/,2018-01-12 06:12:56,"There are times in every relationship when there is a desire discrepancy, and by virtue of the fact that you are on this sub, this has certainly been a problem in your relationship(s). This is a guide for LLs and HLs who want to find a way to adjust their partner's libido up or down, but aren't sure how to do that. The bad news is that you only have indirect control over your partner's libido. The good news is, tht still gives you some control! The LL always controls the frequency of sex and the HL always controls the frequency of the initiations. The HL initiates, and the LL decides which initiations to accept. But the HLs actions, especially when they are rejected, can have a great influence over how likely the LL is to say yes. You can't negotiate desire, but you can and do influence your partner's willingness to accpet the vulnerability that comes with desiring you. At any given time, they are in full control of whether they allow themselves to be receptive to their own desire or not, and they can choose to completely shut down openness to desiring if they choose. They are much more likely to do that if doing so gets them the validation and reassurance they need to feel good about themselves. If you want them to want more sex, then you must find a way to make desiring sex the least anxiety and insecurity inducing option for them. If you want them to want less sex, then you must find a way to make having sex the most anxiety and insecurity inducing option for them. The following will show you how to do either of those things from the HL or the LL side of the equation. - **As an LL, the best thing you can do to lower HL's libido is have sex with them regularly.** This gives them the reassurance and validation they need and will reduce their libido over time from very high, to high over time. - **As the LL, the best thing you can do to increase HLs libido is to reject them regularly.** This will remove the reassurance and validation that they crave and probably lead to them desperately pursuing sex with you. If you do this enough, and they don't learn to deal with it well, then you can probably whip them up to a feverously high libido over time. - **As an HL, the best thing you can to do lower LL's libido is to work on getting more angry, resentful, and distant when you're rejected.** Your anger, and resentfulness, passive aggressive withdrawal of affection, and desperate pursuit are strong reassurance that LL is desirable and important to you. Use them as a reward when LL rejects you so they can get the reassurance and validation they need without resorting to sex. Pursue SO ever more desperately as they reject you more, and get as upset and passive aggressive as possible to provide maximum reassurance that you love them. Be consistent in acting that way when LL rejects you so that LL can learn that the way to get maximum affection and reassurance from you is to reduce the frequency of sex, even if it means forgoing the awesomeness of having orgasms themselves. If you do this enough, you can completely override their natural libido over time, and completely eliminate their desire for sex altogether. - **As the HL, the best thing you can do to increase LLs libido is to treat LL with love and respect whether you're having sex or not.** Give LL the reassurance they need all the time by showing LL consistent love regardless of what's happening in the bedroom. This requires learning to self soothe your hurt feelings when you get rejected and be capable of showing love even when you're not feeling the best. If you've spent years trying to lower their libido with anger and resentment, then it will take time for them to start to interpret this as anything other than a desperate attempt to get laid (thus still providing the reassurance and validation they need to fee loved), but once that passes and they start to see that you are not willing to give more reassurance the longer it's been since you've had sex, LL will be far less willing to forgo orgasms because the reward for doing so has been removed. Their libido will slowly increase. You may think that it's a bad idea to treat LL well when they reject you. You might think that they won't know that you want sex. Trust me, they already know this. Treating them well is a way better idea than rewarding LL with reassurance that you want them by getting all butthurt. That just confirms for them the above observation that the best way they can keep you wanting them is by refusing sex. We all want to feel wanted, both HL and LL. Give LL that gift when you have sex, not when when don't and you'll find that LL has more incentive to desire sex. Side note for LL: The above technique for raising your HLs desire only works up to the point where they feel completely defeated and destroyed at which point they will feel the need to exit the relationship. At that point, they will stop pursuing you in response to rejection, and will instead exit the relationship. Without that reassurance, you will suddenly find your libido will skyrocket, since you need sex to provide the validation and reassurance you used to get from HLs anger and resentment. If you offer them ""hysterical bonding"" sex for a while, then they can go back to a moderate level of wanting you, but they will not offer you the fervent wanting that you need to feel loved until you ramp up the rejections again. For both HL and LL, if you want to block your partner's ability to control your libido, while at the same time learning to take full control of your own, the David Schnarch books give an overview of the process of becoming differentiated which will instill you with those emotional superpowers. All the best, and please use this information responsibly and for good!"

He doesn't want sex that much, and I don't want sex that much. We've never really had a whole lot of sex to begin with. We have sex once every other month or so. At first, when we would have sex and I didn't get off, he was upset that I would finish myself after. I communicated that that's a-okay with me - no guys can ever get me off, etc but he was really upset that I would do this, even after I reassured him that I enjoyed the whole process getting there. A lot of times he makes advances, I don't like what he is doing so I shoot the action (not him) down. Examples - when we kiss, my entire face gets wet. When he does a sex slap, it is a very proper two finger tap that makes me cringe. He doesn't seem to know how to touch me right. I am pretty explicitly open when it comes to telling him how to improve but trying at the same time not to crush his ego. He generally gets discouraged when I say ANYTHING, sighs heavily, and stops any advance, but I am just trying to communicate what and how I like it. He is not horny like a lot of guys I have dated in the past. I am used to guys flipping me around and having their way with me; at least, getting me in a position I like. Being on top, for me, is completely a service gig. When we are doing it, he wants me on top - but when I'm already not in the mood to do it, it's really not that much fun for me. In general, he doesn't seem capable of getting off in the mornings, and so when propositioned in the mornings and then I have to get on top, I'm like - what's the point? In the evenings we're generally both extremely tired. I do deeply love this man. The love has never faded. I have always been this way with him; so has he, and he has slowed his advances without expressing much frustration outside of the minutes in which his advances occur. I want us to have a healthy sexual relationship. We have probably had sex under 30 times altogether. It has always been a dead bedroom with us. We have been seeking out a counselor, but trying to find the time and ... bravery, I guess... it just hasn't happened in months. There are some intimacy issues beyond sex - vulnerability, etc. that obviously need massaging. I don't know what to do."

Ive seen it mentioned a few times, **but more specifically vulnerability (or fear of) as a barrier to sexual intimacy.** In my LTR(s) experience (HL) Ive already been as vulnerable as possible (I think). I feel that committing yourself to another is an act of being vulnerable. There is probably very little we would not do for our partners (think life saving scenario). In LTRs many of us have probably hurt each other as much as any two could. (Ive experienced fallouts from serious things that should never have happened in the first place. But, we all make mistakes, and we make them multiple times.) So what is the fear behind being vulnerable? What is the worst that could happen if you allow yourself to be vulnerable? Edit: Im realizing that I should have been more specific, but I really wasnt sure how to phrase it. When I think about, whats the worst that could happen, I suppose I am imagining a couple whose DB is more or less recovered, yet one or both have a fear of vulnerability. I hope that make more sense. I apologize if the title reads ignorantly or flippant. That said I still appreciate the comments that recount where past vulnerabilities have originated. Its not that I do not have them myself, but I guess being somewhat apathetic has made me a little *meh* to some of my own, or rather shutdown. As if in the same way I feel like I already know the worst that could happen in my own circumstance, but they dont bother me the way they used to."

Find a place and time where you can calmly reflect. The second rule of DB resolution is to examine your own behaviour. Especially those adaptations you adopted in the hopes of earning their love: that shit has to stop! The third rule of resolving a DB is to sit down with your partner and remind them of why you chose them, and how that choice held hopes and promises for you. The fourth rule of resolving a DB is to put your partner on notice that those hopes and promises have not been fulfilled and, while you may not have explicitly stated those expectations before, they are out there now. The fifth rule of resolving a DB is to acknowledge that you may not be compatible and that your previously unspoken expectations might not be something they can meet. The sixth rule of resolving a DB is to tell your partner that the suppression of your sexuality leaves you feeling alone and unknown to the person you are sharing your life with. The seventh rule of resolving a DB is to clearly reclaim your being (sexuality included) and to let your partner know that you are living life on your terms and by your rules, you tried their way and it just doesnt work for you. The eighth rule of resolving a DB is to point out that passion can be found elsewhere if it wont sprout in this relationship. The ninth rule of resolving a DB is to express that their rejection and neglect has damaged your trust and openness to vulnerability in this relationship and where love should reign, you have been mired in shame. The tenth rule of resolving a DB is to tell your partner that they have one chance to become a loving, caring and empathic partner moving forward and it begins with their accepting responsibility for failing to discover and accept who you are and for visiting so much pain in doing so. The eleventh rule of resolving a DB is to emphatically pronounce that you will no longer accept being put down; that your wings have grown and you are ready to take flight. The twelfth rule of resolving a DB is to remind your partner of your love for them and your desire to stay with them while asserting that things have changed and that you are open to any agreeable resolution.

She concludes this time that if this is such a big deal, let's get a divorce. Just like that. No figuring it out. No good times and bad. Rather than put any effort in, just quit. How can this be? I love this woman. I've known her for 11 years. We laugh. We go on adventures. We hang out. We work on our home. We got very lucky at times. We rolled with the punches too. We dont make love so much anymore but sometimes it's still good. We used to fuck. It was great. We shared dreams. We made plans. We took risks together. Sometimes we played it safe. We made this and that choice for the ""me"" and the ""we"" in good balance. I thought we were going the distance. Now I feel tossed aside. Discarded. Take it or leave it. Why? I've been so depressed. Pretty much all year. It's not helping anything. I try to maintain gratitude for what we have. I keep on keeping on. But that one song comes on the radio on the way into the office. Or some random memory of that one time...you know. Or lately I'll notice someone looking kind of hot. And then suddenly I'm reeling. Suddenly I realize that life is slipping away. Suddenly it becomes clear that I don't know what I wouldnt trade to be touched by someone who wants to touch me. Suddenly I'm thinking horrible thoughts. Suddenly I realize I haven't gotten shit done all day. Then suddenly I realize I haven't gotten shit done all week. All month. A few months go by and I have to do something. My work is not mindless. I've got a good reputation but I'm running on empty. It's not a good look, but quietly I start smoking pot again for the first time in 15 years. Granted, this very effective for the time being. I get up. I go for a run. Get real high. Jerk off for a mind blowing orgasm. Now I can get some work done. Yay for me. I know it's not a long term solution. Because i'm not really happy. Just sedated. So let's take a trip. Just get away from work and chores and pets. You and me. Ok. I let her pick the place. She chooses...a romantic hotel? What's this? Ok, ok. Be cool. Next day she packs...sexy underwear? Holy shit. Alright, alright. Take it easy. We fly out. Grab some dinner. Nothing fancy. Chill at the beach. Grab a drink and talk about nothing. I'm losing my mind here, but I feel real young. Real happy. Let's go back to the hotel. Oh my...she's wearing the good stuff. But..she's tired. It's been such a long day and such and such and such. We could have a quickie. Or it could be really good tomorrow. I pick option 2. Idiot. Day 2 is get up and go. Sex later becomes sex tomorrow becomes sex when we get home which I know means sex never. Chalk up another sexless getaway. So we came home and I'm real down in that place and she won't leave me be. Fine. Let's talk it up. In kind words, let's walk through the torment. The expectation, which I didn't even set. The ensuing disappointment after disappointment. The shame. longing. The vulnerability. The feelings of inadequacy. The paralysis. The depression. And then she drops the bomb. Well, we've been having these problems along time she says, maybe it's time to call it quits. I didn't know what to say. I still don't know what to say. I guess I'm free. Guys I'm 35 years old. I tried to keep the body but I don't get much say about the hair. We were dead set on no kids so I did the thing you can't really undo to be sure. No regrets but how the hell am I going to start over now? What do I really have to offer? Sell the house? Sure. Not gonna want it anyway. Move to the city I guess? Maybe a new state? Get a new job? Am I up for this? And I'm still thinking I don't want all of that. I want her. And I can have her, just not all of her. I'm so broken up and angry and confused that she just won't love me. I know I'm not perfect. And after writing this I realize that I'm kind of full of shit. But I always made it right for her. And I until recently I never wanted it any other way. And as shitty as I feel, if she was dragging herself through this hell I'd like to think I would show the fuck up. Life is complicated overall but this should be the easiest thing. I honestly don't know what to do. Edit: some incoherent babble because yes I have nothing better to do than read my own shit and stew in it. :[ Edit/Update: thanks for all the insight perspective, and support. I did some deep soul searching today and I'm ready to admit that this is really no blindside. I've just been avoiding the truth for a long time, clinging to what's left. I've even avoided this community at times because there's a lot of turth here and it hurts. But writing it all off is just another short term fix. And what it costs is a much longer, slower pain. As for next steps I'm going to make a plan for protecting myself and ending this thing. I'm not sure how I'm going to handle the inevitable thrashing in the coming days. It'll be hard not to cave if she promised to work at it. Any advice here would be appreciated."
132,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,I think I might be the problem,10,6o4smy,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/6o4smy/i_think_i_might_be_the_problem/,2017-07-19 09:58:25,"I'm a long time lurker. I've been around reddit a long time, but I hate posting. There's something I can't stand about the vulnerability of posting. You write all these things out, put yourself out there and people respond with things like ""You deserve to die"". So I've been around all of the relationship subs; The good, the bad and the horrendous. I don't think I really fit the theme here, but I know something's missing. I'm mid 30's married with kids, all around age 10. We tend to have sex once a week, maybe twice. My wife has no sexual agency. She never masturbates, has no fantasies, rarely initiates, never orgasms. Sex to her, is take it or leave it, but never ever talk about it. She says in order to talk about it, she has to be 'in the mood', which frequents around the same time has Hayley's comet. Yet when we have it, half of the time she's into it. She'll bite &amp; claw, talk dirty. She'll be rough with me, or tell me to be rough with her and tell me how much she enjoyed it, but she'll never orgasm. The other half, she's not. She'll star-fish me, or offer a weak HJ/BJ. My attempts to initiate are met with ""I'd rather not, but if you like I can just sort you out"". The problem is I think... me. It seems her sweet spot is about once a week. Mine is once every 2 days. I mean I could go every day, but I think every 2 days is enough to have something to look forward to without making it routine. So we have sex, say... Saturday morning. By Sunday, I think I could go again, so I initiate, she turns me down softly, and I accept. Monday I think maybe I'll try again. This time she might be evasive, or might give a body reason (she has a lot of body issues). Tuesday, maybe she'll realize that I've tried a few times and offer something out of pity, which makes me feel like crap. Repeat this rotation for, I don't know. A long time. So, have the talk? Our talk(s) have been problematic. She feels she's doing all she can, she's just busy/tired/hates her body. She believes that when she's turning me down, it has nothing to do with attractiveness, it's just she doesn't want it then. For me, each time I get turned down feels heartbreaking. Like she's rejecting me as a person. So I get caught in a negative feedback loop that I'm not good enough, or attractive enough. This is compounded by the fact that majority of the time I have to initiate. I'm putting myself out there, only to be turned away on a whim. I do want to mention a few things that I've tried, just because I don't want anyone to think I'm complaining without action. - Be attractive. I work out religiously and calorie count. I've never ever been fat, and I'm possibly in the best shape of my life, bar a few niggling injuries. - Don't pout. She knows how I feel. We've had the talk a lot, so when I'm rejected, I put on a brave face and just say, no problems and go about my day/go to sleep. - Intimacy outside of the bedroom. I make sure to touch the small of her back, touch her butt, rub her shoulders, if we watch a movie, I'll pull her close. I stroke her hair. I make sure to kiss her passionately. I make date nights, both in and out of the house, plan small ""us"" only getaways. - Fun to be around. I make her laugh. A lot, without being a dancing monkey. I can be silly, or serious, but I don't sulk or act moody even if I've had a bad day. (most of the time... I'm only human and sometimes I can get angry or upset. I also have infrequently acted crabby because I've been sexually frustrated, but I'm still working on that) - Reduce her brakes/stressors. If there's something to fix, I fix it. I do the lions share of the house work, but not enough that she doesn't have anything to do and feel guilty. As I walk through the house if there's something to be done, I do it. I won't stop housework until there's nothing done, and/or we can both stop and have downtime together. The reason I think it's my fault is I know people here have it worse. It's not like we don't have sex. Whenever I do bring it up she's incredibly defensive. ""I will never be good enough for you"" or my least favorite ""You don't go without.... blah blah only have sex once a month and it's terrible"". It's my fault because I crave something so much. Not just the sex, but the feeling of being wanted. I don't know why it means so much to me, but it does. When I bring this up, I'm met with the ""we've been together for a long time, you can't go chasing the honeymoon period"". I sort of understand that, but sometimes I still feel like I'm only kept around for the utility I provide, not a genuine desire for compassion, love and companionship. She assures me that if she didn't want to be with me, she wouldn't be. She doesn't believe in staying for the kids. The body issue thing is a tough nut to crack. She's had a diagnosed issue which we've mostly worked past, but she suffers from low self esteem, which she masks with high self esteem. One day she'll tell me she's so lucky to have me, the next day she'll tell me I'm lucky to have her. It's a tough see-saw to balance on. All in all. I'm toying with a lot of options. I brought up marriage counseling to which she responded we didn't need. I said I thought we could benefit from it because of the above, she said well that's your issue, you have a perfectly happy home here, if you want to start looking for problems you can go on your own. To me this seems like almost a bigger problem than the sex. If she was upset about something, or suggested something she liked, even if I hated it, I would find a way to compromise, or at least discuss it. Here, I'm left feeling marginalized and to be honest, like I'm going crazy. Do I have an issue? Am I stirring up trouble where there doesn't need to be any? Although I get it. She's sick of talking about it, and it makes her feel deficient, which she doesn't need any more of thanks to her low self esteem. I'm not one of those guys that won't leave. I'm seriously considering this an option, but I'd like it to be a last resort, especially since there's a lot of intimacy, just the sex, so how do I explain it even to my kids when they're older that I broke up their home and lifestyle (our quality of life would be severely reduced as we life in one of the most expensive cities in the world), for what amounts to sex a few more times a week. Alright. That's enough rambling. I hope someone out there has some more meat and potatoes out there than ""You deserve to die"". :P "

We broke up in January and, in 2017, I've turned a new leaf. Literally the day after we broke up (I was unhappy for a long time, so don't judge) I met a girl on a dating app. We instantly hit it off in convo like none of the millions of other girls I spoke to before or after connecting with her. She hadn't been in a relationship in five years, and her past relationship was with a guy she also didn't love. She had lots of good advice. At any rate, we started seeing each other more and more frequently. Always at her place, as my past girlfriend was still living in the apartment she and I had shared and I had moved in with friends. Every time I went over we had sex, which was always mutually great. But more than just sex, we quickly developed an undeniable, palpable chemistry. We got each other. And we laughed until we cried. We had the same tastes in books and movies and music. The problem, as she saw it, was that I never had a chance to be single and she worried I'd one day wake up and realize I didn't actually like her- that I had been projecting all the qualities I thought I wanted in a girl onto her. She insisted that I keep seeing other girls, even though she admittedly had a crush on me, at least for a while. Long enough for her to believe my feelings were genuine. This worked for a while. Eventually, though, the chickens came home to roost. By mid-March, she came to the decision that we needed a no contact period where I just dated other girls and did my own thing. We set it for roughly a month, and it was the most depressing month of my life. End of April came around, I reached out to her, we instantly met up and things picked up right where we'd left them. We officially became ""exclusive,"" though we never stopped seeing each other after we started, on May 2, just a few days after we started talking again. I was and continue to be absolutely, head over heels, in love. She withheld reciprocating that feeling for a little while. But I knew she did, because when someone loves you, you can feel it. And on May 25, she did reciprocate, and it was one of the most joyous memories I have. Since we started talking, our lives have been amazing. We make each other so happy. I enjoy doing things for her to let her know she's special, and she does the same for me. The connection is undeniable. In the three months we've been dating we've taken four or five vacations, all of which have been chalked full amazing times, and plenty of sex. A couple weeks after we started dating though, I woke up and she was staring forlorn out the window. She wouldn't tell me what was wrong but eventually explained that she didn't think I was attracted to her physically, because I didn't have sex with her the night before, and because I hadn't been trying to most of that week. I felt horrible, but I knew that I was attracted to her - continue to be- and tried to keep that in mind. Since then we've been probably averaging 3x/week. Sometimes more, sometimes less. There have also been stretches where we didn't for a time. But this is also a bush time for both of us. She has been moving - to four blocks away from me - got a new job, I started running a third office, so sometimes I commute 3-4 hours/day. And the bigger thing is that I get stoned every night. Anyway, last Sunday I had been drinking for the better part of the day, beginning with boozy brunch, then went home and got stoned and watched a movie with her, during which I fell asleep. When we went to the bedroom, I initiate sex, in part because we hadn't had it since Friday and I wanted to be a good partner. Unfortunately, and for the first time I can remember in recent history, while we were having sex, I eventually went soft and couldn't revive my erection while we mutually masturbated. After a while of trying, and me not getting aroused, she put her face in the pillow and began to cry, claiming that I thought she was gross and that I wasn't into it. But it had nothing to do with that; it was just this sort of freak thing. I then made the mistake of admitting to her that I wasn't completely about it when I initiated but that I was trying to be a good lover to her and she asked if I've done that in the past. I confessed there had been times, which she took to mean that I had to try to be into her. She cried that she has never felt that way about me. We fell asleep, rode the train to work in the morning, and I could tell she was upset the entire time. We started chatting online that day and I saw the writing on the wall; she was going to break up with me. She let me come over on Monday night after work, and we ""talked."" Our talk was really just me explaining that she was in love with me - she agreed - that I was in love with her - she agreed - and that she didn't have to end things. That we could work this out. She wouldn't reply so basically I broke up with myself. I said ""but you're still going to,"" to which she sobbingly acquiesced. She said she just couldn't shake the feeling that I'm not physically attracted to her. She said she feels like she initiates 90% of the time (I don't really agree with that), and there have been times where she's tried initiating and it wasn't reciprocated. I suggested to her that I wanted to stop smoking pot for a bit, which I think is a huge libido killer for me, and that she should give us more time, since she fully agrees that in every other department, we're uniquely solid. But she won't really give me an answer. I took my items from her apartment that night and walked home, befuddled. I still have a bunch of her shit at mine. We spent most of yesterday talking online during work, by which I mean I spent a lot of time talking desperately and pathetically at her, and she would reply here and again that ""this is a big deal to me, I know you don't understand that."" She eventually said that she thinks because this has recurred as a theme twice now, it's always going to be a problem. She just says that if she had things her way, we'd have sex everyday. And for me, I'm happy with three times a week. Her math assures her that, at this rate, we'll have a dead bedroom in three years. I disagree. I love sex with her. I never resent her, even the few times that I've initiated sex that I wouldn't necessarily have if I wasn't considering her wants. At this point I'm miserable, because I can't really get closure and start the absolutely fucking miserable prospect of moving on from the love of my life, because she still also considers me hers. She says she's never loved anyone the way she loves me. She says I'm the part of her life she's been missing. And I feel the same. Anyway, I think she ought to let me try not smoking, which I'm not doing because she's trying to change who I am. I'm don't it because it's going to make me sharper, more fun to be around, a better lover, etc. I've also started working out again, which we both used to do heavily before dating officially and have since pretty much given up. But she's so resolute, and she makes all of her decisions on her own with minimal input, so I think it's done. It's an absolute fucking travesty. Especially since this whole thing was ultimately piqued by an unfortunate sexual episode that had nothing to do with her, which actually caused me great vulnerability in the moment and I'd hoped she'd quell. But instead I basically got dumped over it. What the fuck? "

In fact, she's probably the kinkier one, into BDSM, consensual non-consent, DDLG, owns an array of sex toys and is pretty comfortable with herself in front of me. She has absolutely no shyness whatsoever in private, and can frankly be pretty gross at times because she's almost TOO comfortable around me (rubbing and sniffing her vagina whilst getting dressed to check her hygiene level or if she's close to her period, for example, in a completely non-sexual context and in full view of myself). We have had lots of conversations about how to include what we're both into, levels of submission and domination, how to switch, and basically how we can compromise to make one another satisfied. This has included a consideration for me liking anal stimulation (toys used on me), and having occasional full on submissive desires. It took a lot of bickering from her before she could accept what I wanted and needed sexually and has been an issue on and off for quite a while. In recent months she has told me I have an 'unhealthy addiction' with sexual activity because I typically like to orgasm once a day, that I'm 'pressuring' her, and that I only care about 'getting my dick wet'. In truth, I can take or leave PIV sex, but I do like to cum daily. If that means I'm masturbating a couple times a week and otherwise including my partner the rest of the time (a partner who has admitted to having a high libido and spending half of her life masturbating whilst at university). She told me earlier in the relationship that rather than seek consent, would prefer I 'take' it whenever I want, because asking her straight up for consent does nothing for her. She has rape fantasies which I've tried to fulfil (it's really not my thing), has told me in the past that if I want to mastrbate around the house she has no problem with this (and would likely join in), if I woke her up by having sex with her, or even masturbating next to her she'd like it. Conversely she has reverted to recently telling me if she's not in the mood, masturbating next to her would be awkward and would make her uncomfortable, so I really don't know where I stand, frankly. It's honestly like working with two different people, and she is so often highly volatile, and increasingly hypersensitive (which I realise isn't really a matter for here). Yesterday, we'd had a good day together. Laughing and joking, both happy in each other's company, we went out shopping and came back to relax. She said something about 'playing earlier today so we can watch a movie', in other words she wants sex / sexual activity before we eat dinner. Early evening she's on her laptop in the bedroom looking for jobs (she hates her current one) and I'm playing my Xbox, and realising the time is getting on somewhat I thought I'd try initiating with her. I ask her how much longer she's going to be, ""5 minutes"". I give her a deep passionate kiss and touch her body, she's receptive and has a smile on her face. I lay at the end of the bed at her feet and take my joggers down a little and reveal my hard dick. She looks up and says ""playing with your peepee?"". Now at this point I'm fairly convinced she's cool with this being play time. I go into my bedside cabinet and take a small dildo, faff about lubing it up and slowly put it inside me (sorry for the graphic detail), attempting to put on a bit of a show in front of her and breaking down some of my own hang ups about liking butt play. Probably a minute passes and she says ""I'm finding this really uncomfortable"". ""Oh, ok"". Followed by ""I feel like I'm trapped"" so I tell her ""you aren't trapped, if you want to leave the room you can"" so she gets up and walks off. I sit there on the bed exposed in the most vulnerable way, doing something I have shame issues with in attempt to show vulnerability and visually engage my kinky girlfriend, something that took a lot of confidence to do, feeling deeply embarrassed and ashamed! I start shaking (no, not an orgasm, an anxious tremor), clean myself up and just sit there for a moment wondering what the fuck happened. Did I misread the signs? Did I do something beyond her limits? No, all seemed reasonable. I go in to the lounge and start clearing cups etc away to distract myself from my feelings and she extends a hand ""I'll speak to you in a minute"" I say and walk to the kitchen, then took myself off for a few minutes to compose myself as I was still too anxious to be around her. I eventually go back in the lounge and sit next to her and say ""I just need you to understand I feel really embarressed and anxious and I'm shaking, I thought you were interested in playing..."" etc. She immediately tells me off! ""You need to realise how uncomfortable that made me feel, I felt trapped, you weren't engaging me"" etc etc. I ask her if I put her laptop down at that moment instead, then climbed on top of her and fucked her, would she have been ok with that? ""Yes"". Yet she somehow felt uncomfortable with me masturbating in front of her to get her attention because she felt ""trapped"" and tried bringing up an incident where some guy tried to rape her back in college years ago. The fuck? Actually raping her is cool, but if I masturbate in front of her she feels uncomfortable? It becomes an argument, I stay cool but she remains defensive, insisting I apologise to her for making her feel uncomfortable and trapped, and tries to tell me ""I was going to comfort you and tell you it's not you it's me"", but I point out that didn't happen, hasn't happened, and she's only interested in reversing the upset to make it hers rather than mine! I left the house for the evening and went to have a few beers with a friend. I leave the house to a torrent of swearing, and hear her punch walls as I close the door and walk down the drive. I think I've seen enough in this relationship to call it a day. What do you guys think? Am I being unreasonable? Is she nuts? EDIT I came back to the house at 2.30am after she didn't reply to my text asking if she'd eaten. I was concerned for her, so came back rather than sleep at my friends house. She'd deadlocked the front door (the first time she's ever done this) so I had to call the bell, but she was still up. She seemed flustered, all the lights were on and the dildo in question had been tossed across the room. She asked why I came back and was still very bitter, and after a few sentences exchanged she took the duvet and stormed off to sleep on the sofa. Today we didn't exchange a single sentence until this afternoon when she was getting ready to leave for work (shift work in a pub). I initiated conversation again and she very quickly steamrolled in to telling me my reaction wasn't good, that she felt trapped, uncomfortable, the same stuff she said last night but was even more furious about it. She recounted my reaction somewhat inaccurately, told me I tried telling her that she should have been comfortable with it, and that's completely manipulating everything that was said yesterday night. What I did was express how I felt, and said based on our relationship so far, everything we're both into and accepting of in each other, our prior negotiations and hard limits, I didn't foresee her reacting badly. Anyway, she's telling me over and over by text now how I need to start caring about her feelings, that I'm not the only one to be taken into consideration when it comes to sex. It feels like a lot of deflection and manipulation quite honestly, and whatever I say beyond ""sorry, it was all my fault"" is likely to be rebuffed with more anger."
135,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,"5 years, why can't I cum for him?",10,6jprjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/6jprjb/5_years_why_cant_i_cum_for_him/,2017-06-27 12:20:16,"I have been together with my boyfriend for 5 years. I have not been a saint. I spent the first year trying to avoid this relationship, the commitments, and especially the vulnerability. I was 19 coming out of my first break up. I wasn't comfortable in myself, nor my position in life. I had a severely under diagnosed case of maniac depression. I knew I wasn't stable enough for a relationship. I was not a functioning adult, I was very behind in development compared to him. I couldn't stop spending money, quitting jobs, collecting bills, and reveling in bad food, drugs and alcohol. I was a very self-aware of my mess. I was void of caring, so I really didn't have a problem spending a year's time trying to leave him even though I saw how it was slowly blotting out his feelings toward me. It didn't matter, why would it, nothing mattered, I was walking through gray most days. The pain of depression really numbed me to everything. I was cold, and honestly vindictive. Something inside me was abhorrent. The man who is mad for me was out of a storybook. Why did I hate him, yet find myself SO incredibly sexually charged for him? I caused him a lot of pain, distrust, and heartache the first 2 years. I said and did a lot of hurtful things. I went online and showed my body to some stranger because we lost our closeness. I mean, I obliterated the potential of him and I from an entire year of giving him guarded responses, my complete resilience to opening up, and my very, very emotionally detached sex... so, of course our sex was of the best kind of awful. At a time, I was sure I spit, shit and pissed on it straight to hell. Man, I was so messed up on the inside. 5 years total and we made a baby. He's two, and the funniest guy I've ever met. Our problems, namely our emotional intimacy, bled into our son's first year. We have discussed it so many times, I don't even know what angles we haven't hit (maybe the ones in the bedroom?) He knows he overstepped his boundaries and completely disrespected me by begging/crying for me not to leave the 100,000 times I tried to leave. I know I did unspeakably horrible things to him while still saying I love you. I really did love him, but I feared accountability of my actions and owning my vulnerability. I didn't have self-worth, and I didn't know how to love myself. In fact, all I knew how to do was be completely vile to myself and anyone emotionally close to me. Again, I can't look back on that time without scratching my head on *where* my rationale went. I was a good person. I didn't do any harm to strangers, but I had no character, my morals were blurred, and I certainly thought life was valueless. I don't know why he fell for me. I should ask him. His uncle died before we met, and he worked a job traveling so he must have been lonely. Maybe I was the only girl able to tolerate his tendency to come off haughty or how his voice carried in every room. I recall him saying I was the first gal to share in dialogue; I was receptive to his speech. He does talk an awful lot. Some times I just want to lose myself in whimpers and moans. He forwent the detail that he was a virgin. My first thought, during our earliest intimacy, as I eagerly had him go down on me: he must be gay. Why didn't I consider virginity? He licked me with hesitancy as if considering where the enjoyability was. He was good at tit play, and we went with that for a majority of years. He hardly reaches down to make me wet. He sure knows how to hit all my buttons except that one. Why does giving him direction make me feel broken? I have had guys touch me in ways of pure desire, ways of true understanding of female anatomy. Sure, the tune of his touch is lovingly. A kind of way that feels everlasting, comfortable, but not hot. We kiss to feel good and hump when we're ready to turn it up. Then, he slides into me and moans like he's home. I used to get so much satisfaction from that first penetration. It used to take so many short, short, short pokes to get me wet enough for him to fit. Even then, I was tight the whole way through. Now he takes his head, does 2-3 short practice thrusts, and lays it in me. Most of the time he forgoes foreplay. I want oral but his oral doesn't feel good, it makes me acutely aware of how disgusting of a person I am. Sometimes I'd rather fuck a stranger's face because nobody I care about deserves my fat pussy in their face. Maybe I'm still dealing with body image issues and I've always been the bedroom killer. I've always had a wild libido. Some times I fear it's for escapism. I just like to feel good. I was lost in a depressive cloud for over a decade; it's unbelievable the difference between waking up cursing God and waking up waiting to see what today brings. I've lost the 30 lbs I gained from eating the way my boyfriend eats. I have the body I have when we met, and I feel 100% better than during that time. I'm not on medication. Cutting sugar and adding exercising has removed all occurrences of maniac/depressive episodes. It's coming up on 1 year since my last ""meltdown."" I've built and molded myself to be more of his right-hand lady, and I am the most in love with us I have ever been. We are such a happy family. He has taught me so much, and I owe him everything for his patience. I want to cum for him, and I know that would fulfill him in ways nothing otherwise could. He shows no true need for sex unless I raise concerns. He says he's available for me whenever, and it's true, *I* can initiate whenever I want, but I want to be desired. I fear during my depression I conditioned him to not ask for sex, because he would ask, a lot, and I would say no every single time. We talked about that, and puts his head to the side kind of dazed thinking that could have been a factor. He tells me he doesn't know who he is anymore after all these years of trying to cater to me and my needs. His life has taken momentum with a big job promotion; he's slowly coming into himself again. I've always made more money, and I've always worked more. I haven't made him feel like the most manly man over the years through my frustration of not cumming and being the breadwinner; I know he's taken a toll. I've spent the last 2 years religiously dedicating my time to build him up from the damage I've caused. I've never tried rubbing myself to orgasm as he plows away. I've never tried it, I've sure thought about it. I fear it a symbolism of just one other way I ""don't need him,"" but I do. I need him. I need his worldview, his charm, his warmth, his feelings, his sex, his cock. I need him to give me pleasure, not to yelp when he cums because he knows, even if I don't sigh, that I'm left unsatisfied. He knows he failed me. We both know there won't be a round two, he won't need it. Why can't I cum for him? As a high libido, why can't I solve this problem given the freedom to his cock at any given time? Why is it always about him? "
136,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Monsters in the bedroom,16,6jvykg,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/6jvykg/monsters_in_the_bedroom/,2017-06-28 07:35:03,"DBs are painful. A lot of things can be painful. But DBs are different. There was always a sense that it was my fault. I tried to be the best partner I could, i was aware of my shortcomings and tried to work on them. All to no avail. During my marriage I felt like a monster. An ugly, repulsive and horrible monster. I loved the TV show Penny Dreadful and despite not wanting to I always related to Frankenstein's creature: AKA Caliban /John Clare. I'm not ugly, on the contrary. But I feel ugly. After so many years of rejection my view of myself changed. I saw myself as my partner saw me. I respected her, so I thought she saw something in me that was lacking. Maybe my income? My body language? The tone of my voice? The words I use?my approach? There must be something in me that caused her to reject me. Of course, your LL partner will never tell you. She either changed the subject, refused to answer or simply gave contradictory explanations. Eventually her rejection started to feel not as a rejection of my desire but a rejection of me. I was tainted somehow. Something about me caused her to recoil from my touch. So it was that I stumbled upon Penny Dreadful and Frankenstein's creature in his endless quest to be more human and less of a monster. If you have seen the series, isn't his experience how rejection feels? Don't you feel shame at your own nature? Seek to run away, to hide your vulnerability from the world. Don't you look upon other couples with tears on your eyes knowing you'll never know how it feels to have what others have? I wander if this is a common feeling, if other HLs feel as loathsome as I did. If so, how did you change your own image of yourself once you were out? Long rant."
137,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,[18 M] desperately want to have sex with my girlfriend [18 F] of two years again. Dealing with a steep drop of libido.,2,6ka709,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/6ka709/18_m_desperately_want_to_have_sex_with_my/,2017-06-30 04:13:29,"I don't know if I'm posting this in the right sub or not, but I'm desperate so I'm posting it everywhere. I [M18] have a very high libido. I would love to make love to my girlfriend [F18] of two years daily. Last year, in 2016, her libido seemed to me nearly as high as mine, but within 2017 her libido has dropped to what I would consider ""extremely low."" I have explained to her that my libido is high, but it's paired with this deep and unexplainable desire for her. I don't just want sex because my body wants it, I want to really make passionate love to her because it feels like the way to share that feeling with her. And there's something about exploring sex with her that I desire. Her reply was that she understands my sex drive isn't me thinking with my dick but is backed by passion and desire and that she doesn't want me to think she isn't passionate for me because she is, her body just isn't keeping up with it. She explained that she doesn't feel as if she should have to force herself to be ""in the mood"" but that she should just be able to wait until it feels right for her (which I completely understand). I asked her what the potential cause for this dramatic decrease of sex drive and she landed on a few ""possibilities."" Paranoia of pregnancy (although she religiously takes her BC and makes me wear a condom 90% of the time, which in turn makes it much harder for me to finish making the experience a bit....), memories of a time a parent walked in on us 8 months ago which was a bit traumatic for her, more thought over the last year of an experience of sexual assault in her past, and maybe her birth control messing with her hormones. None of these were sure answers but more of a brainstorm of what could be up. I suggested maybe attempting to make herself get into it once, and see if it changes anything. This was met with the response of ""I shouldn't feel like I need to change or that I should need to force myself to be in the mood."" At this point, we have sex about once a month with maybe a one or two days of light fooling around thrown in. Up until now, I have been accepting and have just jacked off a LOT. But I can't take it anymore. I want to share the experience with her so badly. As pathetic as it sounds, last night I tried to jack off and I just started crying. I hated it. Everything I saw made me think of my desperation to be with her. The experience just wasn't fulfilling in the slightest. This is really starting to take it's toll. I'm very sexually frustrated today. I attempt to make small moves every other day(ish) to test the waters, see if she's into it. All of which get shot down. I am just starting to feel depressed over the whole thing. Sex is so important to me, not because I just want to get off, but it bring an intense emotional vulnerability and a strong sense of validation that I need and desire. Without them I start to feel wary about how she really feels about me, even though she tells me I shouldn't be taking it personally. I find myself getting more jealous about other guys she talks to, something I never used to be afraid of. I touch her sensually and I get told off (touch is one of my main love languages). I just want to make love to her, hold her naked body close to mine, SOMETHING vulnerable. Something sensual. I'm craving it. A friend suggested I break up with her. This is not a solution I am a fan of as we have been in a relationship for 2 years and, despite a few recent events, things seem to be going well. I'd even say that our relationship is on an up swing. I should mention that she leaves Friday (tomorrow) and I won't see her for a month. I expressed desperately wanting to have sex before she leaves because I think it's really important, but she's also just recovering from being fairly sick. I'm appreciative of any help you all can lend. Thank you for listening. --- **tl;dr**: Her libido has dropped significantly in the past few months and I am desperately craving sexual connection."
138,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Acting in good faith to your partner,5,6ccrdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/6ccrdu/acting_in_good_faith_to_your_partner/,2017-05-21 07:09:38,"TL:DR I muse about some stuff that I find very profound that is probably as complex as a toddler's financial portfolio. Real TL:DR at the end Hello long-time semi-lurker on a throwaway. I've been trying to develop this thought process that seems to offer some comfort for me post-separation (for DB). I was in one of those DBs where sex still existed, maybe once a week or fortnight which makes it strange when you separate - you know something was desperately wrong in the relationship and you were hurting so bad but it's so confusing to put your finger on what it is (because you can't point to, e.g., a decade without sex or cheating or some clear-cut explanation), and with a victim-plying spouse and you being the one acting in good faith assuming they are too, you end up wondering how justified you were to break up the home. Which leads me to the thing I've been figuring out - thought it may help some others who feel equally confused. Good faith is an extremely important part of marriage (= trust). The legal definition of good faith is: *Honesty; a sincere intention to deal fairly with others. Good faith is an abstract and comprehensive term that encompasses a sincere belief or motive without any malice or the desire to defraud others.* I've been thinking that this presence or absence of good faith is the difference between those DBs that come together again and those that remain broken and ultimately end. I'm wondering if we can take it a step further and use it as a sort of predictor for early/recently discovered DBs so that the HL knows whether to hang on until it improves, or whether to cut and run before their self-esteem gets destroyed. The HLs who get a sense that their SO is acting in good faith can somehow justify/find hope behind the DB and the good-faith LL usually finds a way to fix their LL issues if possible. Some LLs genuinely won't be able to fix it - say, paraplegia, gynaecological cancer, genuine ED from arterial disease. And we all get a sense of 'ok, that would be really tough, but you could put up with it and find some other ways to pleasure each other knowing they still desired you' or something like that. But then there's those DBers who have a spouse acting in bad faith. Numerous false, ever-shifting excuses as to why no sex, false promises for arranged sex with no follow through. Often these spouses demonstrate outside the bedroom that there is contempt/resentment/distance in their approach to the HL. And no matter how frequent or otherwise the sex is, a person just *knows* (eventually once we've seen the recurring pattern enough times) that the LL is acting in bad faith in the relationship/marriage. The basic issue is that the HLs needs do not matter to the LL, and despite creating a smokescreen of reasons, the LL has no intention at all of meeting the HLs needs. This attitude invariably is present throughout the relationship (outside bedroom too), and destroys the core trust between the couple. This rarely improves and may indicate a long-term emotional or attitudinal problem of the spouse that they are unwilling to fix = stalemate, HL will never get their needs met, decide if/what you want. I chucked together a quick list below. Signs of good faith: Actions (not words) demonstrate attempts to fix things (excluding the rare occasion it's physically impossible) If sex is physically impossible, attempts to provide for your need in other ways Compassion in the LL partner Not living in denial: a sense of openness about their own issues (e.g.: I suffered sexual abuse, I struggle with sex, this must be hard for you) A sense of vulnerability to the relationship: there is open communication, even if imperfect and heated at times, you as the HL are not 'shut out' of aspects of their heart or life. Signs of bad faith: Lack of emotional connection and intimacy: they are impenetrable emotionally; ask yourself if you have any idea what they are really feeling about life or their thoughts on the DB (other than the more obvious resentment) Resentment is a big feature: they may not even know it themselves, but they can't forgive something (lots of things) you did, and may be friendly on the surface while their resentment displays itself in other ways. Resentment always reveals itself somewhere.* No actions taken to improve connection and sex between you: don't mistake good-sounding words for actual valid open-hearted attempts to meet your needs. The good-faith person will do whatever it takes to make you happy. The bad-faith partner just wants you to leave them alone. They will only take action when your needs start threatening their lifestyle / they are in this relationship for the secondary benefits (security etc), not for you. Limited acceptance of blame: it's your (HLs) fault all the problems exist; or it's XYZ from my past that shall never be forgiven, or it's the way your parents XYZ etc etc. Refusal to validate your emotions: you (HL) are not made to feel reasonable in your hurt about the DB. You feel 'blocked', frustrated and not-listened to when discussions about DB come up, and this is a recurrent pattern. Other signs of contempt in the relationship: being talked down to, eye-rolling, a sense they despise what you say/stand for/are as a person. Google Gottmans four horsemen of the apocalypse. *this resentment issue couldn't be fixed in my marriage; but it's worth the HL trying to address it with genuine attempts to find out what caused it and genuine requests for forgiveness, with gifts/amends to consolidate. Good apology may soothe some of this and we all do hurtful stuff in our relationships. But if they refuse to address it/discuss it/believe it exists, you've got a big problem. Anyway this is getting long but one parting thought. People who act in bad faith have all sorts of reasons for doing it - most of us are broken in some way or other. It doesn't necessarily make them monsters out to destroy your life (although there are some sadistic people too). But what it does mean is that they're acting in bad faith with respect to the legitimate aspects of the unspoken/spoken contract set up when you enter an exclusive sexual relationship. The ONLY one thing that differentiates relationships from friendships is the sexual connection. It's a fundamental part of marriage and long term pair-bonding. In legal terms there are consequences to acting in bad faith when you're in a contract, and similarly with marriage there are consequences such as destroying the marital bond and home and causing emotional followed by physical separation. HL may be the one leaving, but the responsibility for the separation lies with the bad-faith LL. Just check yourself that you too are acting in good faith in your relationship before pointing the finger at your spouse. TL:DR LLs acting in good faith more likely to save their marriage; LLs acting in bad faith tend to destroy theirs. Signs of bad faith may instruct an HL as to the potential future success of their attempts to fix the DB. Signs of bad faith may reassure the HL that they're not going mad when they can't pin-point exactly what's wrong in the relationship."

The reason, a tournament my daughter was invited to on ""my time"" (we have 50/50 custody so versions two and three were with their mother). My daughter had a great weekend playing before scouts. We were totally stoaked by the opportunity. It played out exceptionally well on that front. Where it played better, requires contrast. We rented a three bedrooms condo: one room for her kids, one room for my atheletic wunderkinde, and of course, one room for my partener and I. With my ex, this setting would've been falsely promising and lead to total sexual disappointment. With my GF, it led to fucking like rabbits. After my daughter's first game, we all retired to the condo and my GF announced to her kids that she wanted a nap. She put the TV on cartoons while I stored the thing we brought. My daughter retreated to her room and my GF came out of ours with a knowing ""I don't need a nap, I need you to fuck me"" look.I did not disappoint. We fucked 5 times this weekend. My ex and I would need three months to attain that frequency. But frequency aside, every interlude between my girlfriend and myself was an enterprise in growth, of feeling stronger together. We value this means of connecting, we want to open fully to each other and strive to every time. For it feeds our vulnerability together when our clothes are on. Good luck DB breatheren.

140,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,A classic post from long ago...,89,6gfigq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/6gfigq/a_classic_post_from_long_ago/,2017-06-11 00:31:06,"This post is from a woman in a sexless marriage posted years ago and was considered one of finest portrayals of the raw feelings of one person in her situation. Enjoy it but be prepared to shed a tear. ------- This is What a Sexless Marriage Feels Like This post is not about virtue. It is not an ask for sympathy. It attempts to explore what I've learned about sex and sexuality since sex ended within my long-term relationship. I won't say much about why, because half of it is not my story to tell and I have no right. Just know that because of illness and after sharing a normal, monogamous, sexually active relationship for nearly a decade, my spouse suddenly lost the need, desire, and passion for sex. When sex disappears like that, you don't necessarily know it at the time. There's no announcement. No resetting of hormones for each of you. No discussion that starts with, ""I'm thinking I'll never want to have sex again. Are you ok with this?"" It's just gone. One day, perhaps months or years later, you realize that the last time you had sex together was the last time youd ever have sex together. As Ive gone through these years without a sexual connection to my spouse, sexual desire did not fade within me. I still think about sex and long for it, I still dream about it, and fantasize. I do try to minimize overt exposure to what can make it harder. I dont read the OS dirty haikus on Thursday and I never read sensual erotica. I look away during sex scenes in films. I no longer engage in hows your sex life conversations with friends. And yet, even with these rules and a relationship devoid of sex, sex remains a part of my life, in my mind, in my dreams, and in my writing. As Ive gotten through these last eight years, Ive thought a lot about sex, sexuality, and relationships. Here is some of what Ive discovered: Sex is vital to a good life. What? You thought you knew that? So did I. I knew sex reduced my stress level, added to my joie de vivre, helped me sleep more soundly, and that it made the mornings after sweeter. I knew that dependable, good sex was very important, even imperative to a good life and relationship. Going without sex led me to understand its meaning even more: I understand how it nourishes and comforts, touches the soul, sustains our natural rhythms. All of that was happening before, so I never examined the how or why. Going without sex now, I can see how the lack of it upsets each of those things. Sex may not be a need like air, but it is needed. Yes, I can live without sex, I pretty much do, but I dont live joyfully. Its gotten harder, not easier to go without for so long. I need sex to live the life I wanted to live, to feel happiness to the potential I have within me, to carry me through lifes challenges and sorrows. I need sex like I need friends and conversation, like I need the sun and spring, like I need books and music. I need sex to make all of those things better, too. Some nights, sex is all I can think about. I ache to be desired and wanted, to give way to joy and abandon. There is no substitute for the moment when your lover reaches out for you with passion, or with love. Trust me on this, there is no substitute. Sex holds you together when everything else is pulling you apart. Another given, but think about it for a gentle moment. How many times has that tender caress, that kiss that lingers just a bit longer, that flirtatious glance made you feel closer, safer, connected, a couple, united? How often has it been the bridge from anger to forgiveness, from stressed to relaxed, from lonely to loved? It works. Sex does the job it is supposed to do, fusing you as a couple. Sharing sex means exposing vulnerability, intimacies of the heart and body. You know secrets about each other that are beyond naked and truer than fact, learned during uncensored moments of bliss. Honoring and protecting those secrets is a gift to each other. Sex makes me feel like a woman and nothing else really does. My career doesn't do that for me. Spending time with friends doesn't. Volunteering doesnt. Wearing skirts and lingerie helps, but still.... sex? Oh yes. That's when I feel womanly and confident, aching to express my desire and eroticism, and ready to reveal the mysteries of my gender. Nothing else asks me to reach in and grasp the inner femaleness that flows so deep, that yearns to surface. Going without sex now, I sometimes feels less of who I am, less connected to my friends and other women, a little less relevant in the world. I feel distant from myself. Our sexuality continues to evolve over time, even after many years. About five years into this, I realized something very new about my sexual desire, something I had not considered before. How could this be? I wasnt in an active sexual relationship, I was making every attempt to de-sexualize myself, and suddenly a new sexual idea came to me begging to be explored and experienced. How unfair and cruel! This revelation thrilled, stunned and scared me. How and why this came to me during the sex-free years of my existence remain obscure to me, and yet there it is. Just another reminder that sexuality, that basic human drive, has a life of its own. Sex allows you to communicate in ways that you cannot replicate in any other way. What you can do with your fingers, your mouth, your hips.... all those luscious areas of the body that allow for expression that can't be articulated any other way. During sex you can whisper and tease and demand and beg with intonation and nuances that are not appropriate in any other setting. I miss this language so dearly and with such a vengeance that I have to continually monitor myself to be sure I don't do it in the wrong setting. I have to say, honestly, this is probably what I miss the most  the language of sex. ************ is nice. And I am a pro. I swear to all of you, none of you are better at this than I am. I always knew ************ was nice, but before it was just a warm-up or a way to tide myself over between couple-sex events. Now it is sex. ************ gets to be very, very lonely. Not lonely enough to totally stop, but lonely enough that sometimes an ****** from solo ************ ends in tears and a feeling of profound solitude. Sex gives us some hope. Sex makes us hope, for more, for better, for different, for the same. During the good years, we had sex pretty regularly, as couples do. Thursday night? Always. Again on a weekend night and a weekend morning, even both weekend mornings. And then there was Tuesday, the bonus day. Tuesdays felt a little hopeful, a little romantic, a little sexy. I miss that feeling, wondering if it will be a sex Tuesday. I miss counting on sex on Thursday, and looking forward to weekend sex. Going without sex all the time adds a layer of drudgery to the week. Now it's just work, time after work, and then sleep. Same thing tomorrow. Same thing next week, next month, and next year. Sex adds that soft glitter to the winters gray, a soothing balm to the end of a long work day, a benevolent barrier to the world outside. The less I had sex, the more I thought about it. During the first few years of this, I thought about sex all the time. There wasn't a conference room table on which I didn't imagine a lewd image during a business meeting. I couldn't enter an elevator without seeing myself pressed against the wall by a lover and kissed passionately. When I traveled, hotel rooms kept me awake at night as I thought about all the options therein. I have consciously worked to mitigate those thoughts and thats helped, but even that success feels like a loss. Sex makes me love my body. Watching, feeling, hearing a lover take pleasure in my body and receive it from my touch, these feelings are inimitable. A lovers certain touch affirms me emotionally and physically. Knowing that my body and my own touch produce exquisite gratification and joy tell me I am a sexy, sensual woman. I appreciate my body and am glad for it, but I ache to express and enjoy its sexual potential. Our sexuality is a gift of comfort and passion that we offer the world, an offer to sustain a love, to convey our essence from our soul. There is more to say, but even a non-sexual relationship deserves some privacy. Thank you for respecting that. Please remember these are just my lessons. They may be meaningless to others who face this, and to those of you who are sexually active. I honestly can't predict what will resonate for anyone. I beg you not to tell me I am wrong, but to trust that this is what I think and feel. "
141,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Rant from the other side?,18,68hb3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/68hb3a/rant_from_the_other_side/,2017-05-01 05:26:58,"I made a conscious choice to have a DB. Our relationship was not perfect aside from the sex. It was pretty much the opposite  often dysfunctional except in the bedroom. We used to have a frequent and varied sex life with oral, anal, toys, role playing etc. Many years it felt like we only got along from the neck down. I only had one tiny complaint The first time I got the *When Harry Met Sally* act (as a newlywed), I asked my wife with all the compassion and vulnerability I could muster to please not lie to me when I am naked, which she promptly denied. My partners orgasms have always been very important to me  my absolute, all-time, second favorite thing about sex. I dont really care how it happens - oral, her hand, my hand, vibrator, whatever. I just enjoy being along for the ride. And I am fine with the knowledge that there are some times thats not what she wants or its just not going to happen even when she does. If youre satisfied, Im satisfied. Just be real and let me know so I can relax and enjoy myself. Please dont sacrifice our intimacy to serve some outdated, self-indulgent delusion about my ego. I need a genuine connection; authenticity is not negotiable. But despite my pleas, she continued to fake her orgasms several times a year, whenever it suited her (its not as easy to get away with as some ladies believe). I pointed it out and restated my values the first couple dozen times or so, but the answer was always the same, so I eventually quit asking. She also repeated this deception over and over during counseling, until finally, after a series of lies that came progressively closer to the truth, she admitted what I had known all along. The kicker is that she *continued* to repeat the behavior even after this admission. At that point I was done. After years of having my boundaries ignored, my desire is pretty much dead. I have explicitly stated on multiple occasions that if she wants to work on developing a new relationship, Im willing to try. I know I had a big part to play in all this and Im willing to face that, but no way am I going back to what we had. And this is where I relate so much to the lonely HLs on this board - none of this seems to be important enough for her to step out of her comfort zone and address these very difficult issues. So like many here, I stay for my kids. My youngest is 16 and very much needs his father at home right now. I know it is less than ideal, but since I have stopped pushing for real intimacy, our home life has become fairly serene. We rarely fight, we regularly hang out as a family and as a couple and we coparent well. Im beginning to think we are much better friends than we ever were lovers. Im fine with the idea of doing this for two more years, since I have developed a deep and passionate relationship with my laptop. But I do wish it could be different. tl;dr After years of deception in the bedroom, I have sworn off sex. I guess I dont really have a question, but Im grateful for the support and education I find in this sub. "
142,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,In Crisis: On Verge of Leaving LL Wife for HL Woman I Met Recently,15,69nnf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/69nnf5/in_crisis_on_verge_of_leaving_ll_wife_for_hl/,2017-05-07 07:27:58,"I'm a HL male -- whose sexual desire is as spontaneous as biologically possible -- married to a wonderful, beautiful woman for 15 years whose responsive desire, sadly, has always been incredibly difficult to arouse. We have two young children, and overall a great home and supportive relationship. But since the first year of our marriage, I've been sexually frustrated. Mightily. Nothing helped or worked. Last year, and I'm not proud of this, I finally decided to deal with this frustration by seeking sex outside the relationship, and just happened to meet an incredible, smart woman whose sexual desire is as spontaneous as mine, if not more so. Our sexual intimacy is ridiculously mind-blowing, every single time. We both feel this way, and we've developed a deep love. She doesn't want me to hurt my wife or family, but at the same time, she admits she wants to build a life with me if I leave my wife. We kept our affair secret for several months, but when it became unsustainable, and when I no longer wanted to live a lie, I openned up and admitted it to my wife. That sparked a months-long process of us trying to see if we could repair the relationship and make it work, during which she has read (among other things) COME AS YOU ARE and has made strides in her own responsive desire. So I could see things were improving. My wife was trying, and learning for the first time she actually likes sex. But the sexual compatibility is still not what I need: there is a vulnerability she feels about sex which makes it hard to open up, even though she admits she likes it and is willing to engage more. I have HL girlfriend in the back of my mind constantly, creating an unfair comparison. In truth, I haven't been able to give my marriage a proper second try because I'm afraid of losing my HL love. And I also know intuitively that no matter how hard we try, I'll never be satisfied with my wife. So I'm on the verge of ending my marriage over sex, and I'm torn up about it, because I'm trying to figure out how I could possibly destroy my family home and my childrens' sense of security over issues of sexual desire. I'm not sure I'm looking for advice, just wanted to share. Perhaps doing so will be enough to help me find my way. Perhaps someone will have something to share which will help me with this. Thanks for reading, those who took the time. "

Her exact wording is what I told him ""Couples therapy would be a healthy forum to address my issues and his vulnerability about the things that occurred."" Took me over 2 weeks to work up the nerve. I finally did and got no response on way or another. So, today at my session her and I were discussing his non-answer and she said to approach it again (a week later from me first asking) Basically I got a pretty hard no, that it is my responsibility to fix what ""I fucked up"" I 100% intend to continue on with my own individual therapy (he knows this). I don't know how much more responsibility I can take for my part of this mess. So, tonight I gave him an ultimatum (something that was discussed with my therapist, just so it's clear I didn't just act in a emotional moment) Basically I said we need to start therapy together or he needs to leave. He refuses to do either. I know a lot of you will say leave and it's so easy to say those words, but I refuse to pick up my kids (2 living in our house) and just walk out. I have been lucky enough to work a part-time job for the past 25 years that I absolutely love but make piddly squat. He has always been fine with my wages and work hours because I was always available for the kids school pick-ups and activities. He intends to stay and ""see what happens"" What is happening is me imploding on myself it feels. At the end of our discussion he did say he would join me for a session or two or mine to see what my therapist has to say. When I asked what are you going to tell her when she recommends couples therapy? And he said I'll say the same thing I told you. He doesn't see how therapy would benefit us. I was so hurt by that statement. How in any logical world could I do anything other than help!"
144,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,My husband (33 HLM) and I (35 LLF) - is there any hope?,2,64uyp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/64uyp0/my_husband_33_hlm_and_i_35_llf_is_there_any_hope/,2017-04-12 10:45:00,"Hi redditors, Soo a bit of (fairly boring background). Hubby and I have been together almost 10 years, married about 5.5 years. We've recently entered a trial separation primarily due to dead bedroom (on his side) and lack of emotional closeness (on my side). From the start hubby told me how important sex was to him. Everything was fine to start with but after about a year of living together it started tapering off. After we had our first child one year into the marriage the sex become virtually non existent. I did have a really difficult time adjusting to motherhood and didn't feel supported by him at all (I'm guessing because he was already feeling resentful about lack of sex and had entered the 'you don't do what I want so I won't do what you want' spiral?) so that certainly didn't help. I bear so much guilt for this and feel truly terrible. I'm a massive failure as a wife in the one area that was most important to him and it tears me up inside. Also knowing that all the other stuff I was great at meant nothing in the face of this issue is really hard to deal with. We recovered somewhat in the lead up to child #2 but total DB since then (although I did work up the courage to offer on 2 occasions but got rejected. He has not initiated at all). We're in counselling now but it doesn't feel like we're making progress. It's obvious from counseling that we're both retarded at communicating emotions and resolving issues which has probably caused this whole situation. However, the sessions are basically characterised by me pouring my heart out and him just being angry, bitter and resentful. It's so hard to sit there every session and listen to what a fuck up I am and it's like he can't access or acknowledge any other feeling he has aside from anger. He keeps bringing up random incidents which made him angry that I was never even aware of. When asked what he feels when he sees I'm distressed he says he's sad for me but is not really affected. It's like he's forgotten everything that was good in our relationship. I'm feeling really hopeless. I want to reconcile with him very badly as I love him very much. But everything I say or do just makes him angry - if I do something nice or show vulnerability he thinks I'm being manipulative. If I try to put on a brave face I'm not being genuine. I guess I'm just asking if anyone can relate and if you had any success at coming back from this situation? I.e. whether your HL partner was able to overcome their anger and start feeling positive things again? Note in case you're wondering. Although I class myself as LL I don't believe that's my natural state. I'm not ever going to be a daily sex kind of person but I do like sex where there's passion (i.e. a bit more than 'so, you wanna do it?'). I'm probably more of a responsive libido so initiating is just not my forte. "
145,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,I shaved for this!,64,65ztwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/65ztwz/i_shaved_for_this/,2017-04-18 11:28:44,"I need to vent. I [30f] can not even look at my [29m] husband right now. I'm so done with the long vulnerable talks, the excuses, the promises, the lack of follow through and the lack of action to fix any of the issues identified during the long vulnerable talks. It's been two weeks since we've had sex, we've scheduled and postponed three times already but the stars have finally aligned so off I go to get prepped. An hour later, smooth, clean and smelling like bloody roses I'm plied with barely a few minutes worth of what passes as foreplay and ten minutes of riding his dick. I'll take it, I'll be grateful and I'll remember it could be worse. But now here I am the day after, we've been going about our Sunday as per usual. He's been on his computer most of the day when he comes over, kisses me gently and passionately (oh? Are we actually going to have sex more than once this week/fortnight??) Nope. He tells me he's having a shower.... Code word for he's just downloaded porn and he's going to go whack off to it while I continue preparing our supper. Fantastic. I used to be a sex kitten. I have had men message me years after I slept with them just to tell me they still jerk off to ""that time when you..."" I was confident and seductive and passionate and adventurous and I wasn't afraid to ask for what I wanted. I LOVE sex. I LOVE giving and receiving. I prided myself on never being a passive lover. I was a goddamn sexually empowered goddess of a lay! Now I feel like a meek, unattractive inadequate lump who's very touch is like sandpaper. I cannot do anything right no matter what I do. It's met with silence or even frustration. He doesn't want anything from me during foreplay. I am just a convenient space to offload cum. A warm wet towel that washes itself. We finish when he finishes. I generally orgasm, sometimes purely because biological responses dictate that when a clitoris is continously rubbed against a pubic bone it will create an orgasm... often after we are finished I'm left feeling sad, disappointed and angry. Then there are the occasions I don't orgasm at all, where I'm utterly flabbergasted that he seems perfectly content not to help me finish. I pull out my vibrator but what's the point when all I feel is embarrassed and awkward? I give up. He smiles and snuggles up and falls asleep. I lay awake and stare at the ceiling and wonder where I went wrong, what I'm doing wrong and how fucking frustrating his bullshit excuses are. Just be honest with me! Tell me how you really feel! Your actions prove to me you don't have a low libido, you just have a low libido for ME. Yet you claim how attracted to me you are, you do and say all the right things until it's time to actually act upon them. We identify issues and agree to work on them but excuses take the place of actions. I try to spice things up, I fake confidence, I initiate in a different way, I buy expensive toys AFTER ASKING YOU IF I SHOULD and they lay discarded in a drawer like my fucking self-esteem. You tell me I can ask for anything, so I ask to switch positions while I'm sat mounted on your dick, and you reply ""why?"" Or comply but seemingly under duress. I stop asking for even the simple things and you wonder why. I can't even be completely naked in front of you anymore, even though I'm at the lowest weight I've ever been in our relationship. But that tiny piece of fabric between us protects the last shred of power I still have over my screaming vulnerability. I could never be naked in front of you when I know I look nothing like the girls you spill your seed for. You come out from your shower or greet me at the door when I get home from work and I can smell it on you, see the remains of your activities written all over you, and I can't even take my coat off for fear of being compared to the girls on your screen. You say you love me and you're attracted to me, you go above and beyond to show it too; in every arena but our bedroom. I feel I have two choices: Stay - accept that nothing is likely to change, resign myself to an unsatisfactory sex life with someone who in every other way is attentive and supportive - and be miserable. Or Leave - accept that everything will change, I will lose even more than I have already, resign myself to a new start without one half of my small support network - and be miserable. I'm not ready to leave but I'm also not ready to accept this is our sex life. I just needed to vent and try find a way to lift my gaze to his again. I can't even bloody look at him.

She did. And the therapist eventually recommended couples' therapy. We found a therapist and not long after our first session, I suffered a breakdown and spent 10 months off work before restoring my sense of balance. We were going through therapy during this time and my partner was anything less than supportive of what I was enduring. She saw me as weak and lazy. Her solution to my troubles was for me to simply get back on the horse. In spite of this, I eventually regained my balance and returned to work. During the last months of my leave and the ensuing 6 months, I came to the realization that I had married a selfish and self-absorbed woman who was using me and all that I had to offer. So I ended it in therapy (November 2015). Fast forward to now: I have an amazing girlfriend who is a single mom to 4 kids (two different deadbeat fathers). She rose above her circumstances and is a university professor. In me, she has found everything she has ever dreamed off and treats me accordingly; in her, I have found home - a partner that I adore beyond measure in a dynamic of mutually reciprocal vulnerability. Neither of us ever thought that such peace and serenity could be possible in a relationship. Oh, and did I mention that the sex is off the charts? Back to my ex... she came over this evening to touch base on some issues involving two of our three kids. Our split remains amicable and she seems to have grown to accept that I am allowed to hold different opinions on these matters. She had presented both issues as some sort of a crisis and after hearing her out, I talked things down and lowered the level of concern. She thanked me for the words of reassurance (which kinda had me thinking ""ok, what's the catch?"") and then she told me that she's taken leave from work because she's having difficulties coping. She brought up my own episode and said ""I'm so sorry I wasn't more supportive... I had no idea what you were going through. I..."" tears were welling up and I got out of my chair and she got out of hers and I gave her a good, firm hug saying ""This too shall pass. You will be ok."" She cried in my arms for maybe 5 minutes. Then she sat down and was silent for a time. Eventually, she started recapping our earlier conversation to ""make sure we know what we agreed to."" And then she got up to say goodbye to the kids (it's my week with them) and I walked her to the door. She is not in a good place. I've been there, I know. The worst part of all of this is that as much as I would like to deny it, a small part of me wanted this schadenfreude. A part of me wanted her to be miserable after I left. A small part of me wanted her to suffer as I'd suffered being the adult in the relationship. I'm not enjoying her pain in the slightest. I'm angry with myself for even thinking that she deserved any ounce of what she is going through. She is the mother of my three children and my partner for 23 years. I want her to be well. I want her to succeed. I want, most of all, for her to be happy. My partner might have been guilty of a deep lack of empathy in our relationship, but that shouldn't give me a pass to behave or think likewise. I learned something about myself today: I'm not as squeaky clean a lover as I thought I was. But I am still a compassionate SOB."

I started off agitated with my husband over him hemming and hawing about whether to go see a movie or not. The man can't say yes or no to anything ever. Always evasive answers. So, things just snowballed from there. I finally worked up the nerve to ask if the DB situation was any closer to being resolved for him. Basically it comes down to him not being comfortable with my anger for the reason he is still withholding. Anytime I am in a bad mood, he sees that as anger. I asked what angry looks like to him. It's my tone of voice more than anything he said. So, I brought up that my counselor has said it's time we should really be starting couples therapy (with me continuing to do my own individual therapy). My therapist and I both agree that it would be a healthy forum to address my issues and his vulnerability issues. Got no answer from him either way. Crickets! So, in the meantime I have to act like none of this is pissing me off and hope he decides he wants to fight for our marriage like I do. I even asked him to start keeping a log of my anger, I got an ""I'll try"" Beyond frustrated with no end in sight of the DB"

My (31F LL) husband (31HL M) and I have had a bad month. We've only had sex 4-5 times because I am dissociating in the middle of it. I used to only dissociate after sex. So, that's a change. When we have bad experiences, my husband just won't initiate again. I get it-- He feels guilty wanting to do something that sometimes makes me upset. I keep telling him to initiate anyway-- I need to have sex consistently to maintain interest. If we go a week, it's an effort for me to start over. But then I know he gets in his head about making it a positive experience. I am probably the only LL in the world who says to their partner ""Just fuck me anyway, it's what I need,"" and he is hesitant. So, we had sex Monday night. I started to dissociate in the middle of it. I told him but pushed through it and we were successful and it became enjoyable. Afterward, I told him I think I am going from 0-60. We are not super affectionate throughout the day. So, there isn't much build up for me. This is my fault-- I am not an affectionate person. He says I am getting better-- I touch him randomly more when I feel urges to. He is fit so I touch his stomach a lot. As I walk by, I scratch the back of his neck briefly. Sooooo, I determined I need some sort of graduated exposure. Build myself slowly up with affection but I had no idea where to start. I've been thinking about this for a little while but needed guidance. He told our therapist last night that when he hugs me or tries to initiate prolonged affection, he can tell I am waiting for it to end. This is true. So-- we are going to work our way up. When one piece of affection is both comfortable and spontaneous for me, we move onto the next. And I am hoping this increased affection throughout the day will make the vulnerability of sex less difficult for me. This is the part of the post where I whine that I am a terrible wife and/or broken. It wasn't always like this. I really wish I had caught all of these issues sooner, before they disrupted our relationship so much. EDIT: For those who are new to my story, dissociation means I sort of detach from myself or reality. My surroundings stop seeming real. I don't seem real. The room spins. I've exhausted the possibility of it being a panic attack. This therapist thinks I dissociate when I feel vulnerable, as the only other time I dissociate is around family. I have literally had this FOR YEARS. Probably since I was 6 or 7 but it only began to happen during sex a few years ago. Prior, though, I would often feel ashamed when having sex. "

Granted, I only tried to work on my sex stuff with three of them but I am really fucking excited. Everyone else, truthfully, didn't know what was going on. I hate criticizing my profession but I learned we therapists need to up the ante on our abilities to process sexuality for our clientele. I purposely sought a male therapist-- that perspective will help me upheave all of the really twisted fears I have with male sexuality. He is a licensed marriage and family therapist with a PhD in human sexuality. The perfect combination. He validates I have some really unhealthy thoughts and beliefs with sex. However--he thinks I dissociate/depersonalize/derealize after sex because it's a vulnerability thing. And, for me in my weird head, nothing feels more vulnerable than sex. My husband and I have an appointment for couples therapy in a few weeks. And this dude is able to give me very specific assignments and activities to begin, as he says, ""rewriting my script about sex."" I've been trying to do it myself for a few years but was doing it alone and one cannot learn to be vulnerable when they are going about it alone. He gave me this beautiful analogy, too. I have a lot of closed doors and windows. I am so guarded and afraid. I am holding all my false beliefs hostage inside with me. I have been trying to open the door slightly to let my hostage out. He says I need to throw open all my doors and windows and as I let healthier things in, it will naturally shove out my unhealthy hostage of shitty, damaging beliefs. He also gave me a great recommendation for a renowned sexuality therapist and I'm about to buy his book. Gentleman's name is David Schnarch and his book is called *Passionate Marriage.* I will let everyone know if it's useful and perhaps we can add it to the sidebar. "
150,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Wanting to create an app for couples having difficulty asking SO for sex and would love some opinions.,4,5svqfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/5svqfe/wanting_to_create_an_app_for_couples_having/,2017-02-09 08:41:47,"My coworkers and I wanted to develop an app in the area of human sexuality and would love some opinions. We are not app developers but think it is a good idea and have had some great conversations talking about it in the office. The idea for the app was sparked by our personal experiences and researcher Bren Browns writing on vulnerability and intimacy in couples: ""When I asked people What is vulnerability? a large percentage of them used the example of initiating sex with my wife or initiating sex with my husband. Yet there can be no intimacyemotional intimacy, spiritual intimacy, physical intimacywithout vulnerability. One of the reasons there is such an intimacy deficit today is because we dont know how to be vulnerable. Its about being honest with how we feel, about our fears, about what we need, and, asking for what we need. Vulnerability is a glue that holds intimate relationships together."" We found that many members of our team  most of them in long term relationships  had also experienced difficulty initiating sex with a partner. For some us, initiating sex is accompanied with a real fear of rejection. For others, time and energy constraints make it so they never initiate sex. For many, we believe this fear of vulnerability leads couples to have less sex. We wanted to create an app as a way to help couples: Embrace this vulnerability in a safe, pre-determined place  where it is ok to ask, and ok to say yes, or no. Lead couples to communicate more openly about sex in a positive way, where neither feels taken advantage of or objectified. The first phase of the app code named ""In the Mood?"" is meant to be very simple where after your accounts are linked one partner can send a message through the app asking if they are in the mood meaning that they would like to be intimate and a scheduled time. The other partner can then respond to the request with yes, no or yes but time change. The only other thing in the app is a way to message each other. They can flirt, send pictures and hopefully get excited about their romantic encounter. Other features could come in later but this is what we think phase 1 should be. What do you think? Did we miss something you think would be great? Would you use it? Any other comments?"

Visited her again and she says I mis-interpreted what she was saying. Seemed sincere but still, I don't know how I could mis-intrepret THAT bad. Anyway, we were doing our ""checking in"" homework from our couples therapist where we have to list out three feelings we have been experiencing in the last day our two. One of my was ""I'm lonely."" Later in the conversation she is mad because she feels like she is being set up for failure. That all of this is for nothing because I""m going to leave anyway. ""You say your are lonely but I'm right here."" But she's not. There is no empathy for me. No validation of my loneliness, just the fact that I should not be lonely because she is right there. As in the same room. She completely doesn't understand that touching and hugs and stuff like that is important. She rarely shows any vulnerability, just an intellectual point of view. I want to know how she feels, what she worries about, what she needs, what makes her tick. I gave her a hug and she sat there like a dead fish. On the plus side, I'm feeling much better about owning things that are mine and pushing back when they are not. She compulsively tries to manage our kid's day. When I don't she feels that I should be. I told her I don't feel that way and that feeling is her's to manage. Not my fault nor my responsibility. When you feel that way, let's talk about it. I can help support our kid being able to independently find things to do rather than us always being on the hook to entertain her. She pouted. Anyway, its another Christmas. 12 years since PIV resulted in one of us having an orgasm. 2.5yrs since an orgasm from any activity (oral, anal, hands, whatever). I told her I took PIV off the table. Not an option anymore given her medical/psychological issues. I clarified for her that I still want it and miss it. But I am never asking for it again. It was an attempt at reducing pressure. For my new year's resolution, I have as a goal to focus my therapy and self-improvement work on improving my self-worth and determining whether I'm staying or leaving. Some of you will say that I should have left long ago, and I'm sure you would have. Each of us has their own reasons for staying as long as we do and if I leave, I will do so when I am ready. In the meantime, I am going to use this piss-poor relationship to learn more about me and how I deal with relationships, attachment, and intimacy. I can't learn about those outside of a relationship and I definitely don't ever want it to happen again if I do leave. Thanks for reading. Hope your holidays are safe and warm. "
152,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,A DNR for a DB?,9,5f8eem,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/5f8eem/a_dnr_for_a_db/,2016-11-28 10:51:34,"Hey all! &lt;_As I normally sit courtside and respond to others' posts, being an OP is a little awkward. Forgive me if the following doesn't seem to make sense._&gt; I'm currently in an 18-month DB that shows little sign of abating. It was preceded by years of ""stolen"" sex-- 30 minutes maximum, about every 15 weeks, no matter how much intimacy existed between episodes-- that caused me to develop major performance anxiety (manifested as either hardly ever initiating, problems getting/maintaining an erection during foreplay, or not being able to finish), resulting in a vicious cycle: my wife felt responsible for my issues no matter what I said, which caused me to put pressure on myself to do better next time, which worsened the anxiety, for which she felt more responsible. The stake through the heart of our bedroom came last spring during an argument where she asked me why I never initiated sex; I told her (overspeaking, but truthfully) that it made me feel like a sexual predator because of the limited time we'd have for sex. Since then, the bedroom has remained dead. I started therapy in June to figure out what's been in my head and heart to create the conditions that led to where I am today. Relevant discoveries: * My wife (at least as of July) loves me, but isn't *in love with* me. And the feeling is responsive/mutual at the moment. * My mother, resulting from an incident that happened when I was a teenager, decided the best way to teach me not to repeat that was to dump sexual shame into my head for 10 years-- _""Every woman you meet that's lighter than you will be afraid of you on sight; you won't be a human to them, you'll be a beast, a predator, subhuman...so you have to be MORE afraid of you than they could EVER be._"" * My libido isn't dead, just squelched around my wife (for reasons I haven't completely worked out) * I'm discovering a slowly-growing comfort with being vulnerable within my marriage (my mom continually preached emotional *IN*vulnerability my whole life, because it worked for her), and a proportional baby-stepping toward reconnection with my wife...but (at least for now) I'm finding that I **don't** want to reanimate the DB. If I could wall off that part of our relationship-- or if she came to me and said, ""You know...I love you, but I don't think I want to have sex with you again,"" I'd do a holy roll in public. And I know it sounds counter to the goal of most DB situations, but I'm becoming OK with that...even as neither of us have other options for APs/FWBs, or resources to dissolve the relationship properly."

You were exquisite, slim and seductive. We had fucked in the bathroom stall and you said you felt so small in my big arms. When we moved in together, and I had renovated the garden, with a tartan patio and potted plants. I bought us that queenbed, with the footrest coming out of the bottom. Wrestling in the kitchen and chasing you upstairs, taking you down. Down down. Unslipping your familiar bodice, our bodies pulsing in the oil lamp beside us. Coming home from work, greeted by you in your light frock, no bra beneath. Begging me. Ravaging you on the carpeted hallway floor. Your pale lips tracing mine, your frailty, your vulnerability. How I adored you more than anything. When we got married, the little pearls adorned in your veil which glinted under the cathedral beams. Long ago it must be, but I have a photograph. Uncoiling your dressing gown, feeling at home in you. Fucking you long and hard in the night. Children with you. Two beautiful boys. Ours. Holding you in the night when you'd shiver and worry about them. Your hair combed back at dawn and woven down by dusk. You were my world. ""Not tonight, dear"". Your callous indifference and my fumbling introspection. Headaches, pulsing headaches. Tomorrow we can. Always tomorrow. Sucking it up. You're the mother of my children. And I loved you. Year after year, the barren wasteland of sheets and pillows. Starvation. Desperation. Only perpetuating the cycle. Resenting you. For rotting something so beautiful to a stalk. Finding you that Thursday evening, under the covers, in that coveted alcove of his. Asleep in his arms. The divorce. Forgetting the sound of your voice. Seeing you in our children's eyes. This unrelenting grief that haunts my every thought. This searing indignation that burns in me every night. Long nights staring into the darkness. Never feeling right, all these years I've woke up, cold and alone. "

There are always two sides. Thus... I wanted to voice appreciation for all the growth my SO has shown over the past year. We had hit rock bottom back then. She'd cheated on me. Hated me. Hated herself. Anything wrong became my fault. I was weak at the time and enabled it, thinking I was helping. We had fights all the time. Got to the point of spitefulness and mean sarcastic comments. We were on the brink of saying fuck it all. Pretty sure we were both considering ways to end things more permanently for ourselves too. It was a nightmare. Over this last year however, we've grown closer than we have ever been. We communicate so amazingly now it makes me smile thinking of it. She has opened the vault of her heart, the one that has been hurt countless and unrelenting times. That takes strength. She has owned up to her differences instead of living in denial. Has acknowledged the past has hurt her. With what she's been through, if I were in her shoes, I don't know if I could even face it myself. Avoidance is easy. Facing it? Far, far harder. I'm seeing that strength in her I first did. I'm feeling admiration for her show of vulnerability. Her open and unfiltered communication when it matters. The lack of anger and avoidance now. I hope she keeps it up, because I feel like we are back on the road together. She is displaying respect and empathy for my position too. She's been consistently showing me most every way she can that she loves me, that is meaningful to her, and me. We're working on the sexual intimacy, yet we have quite a bit of physical intimacy now. We've come far. Or who knows, maybe I'm an optimistic and hopeful fool. Ha. I suppose time will tell, together at least."

156,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,"HL F / LL M - want to try ""sensate focus"" to deal with performance anxiety and re-eroticize relationship. Any advice?",13,59m9el,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/59m9el/hl_f_ll_m_want_to_try_sensate_focus_to_deal_with/,2016-10-27 15:53:02,"Like everyone else here, sex was frequent and fantastic early in the relationship, dropping some time after we moved in together. We haven't reached a point of stasis yet - from my perspective it has been a slow but unrelenting decline. We are at once, maybe twice, a month right now, and I worry that I haven't seen the bottom yet. It's been devastating to my self-esteem and has taken away one of the primary ways that I connect with a partner. Here's where things sit: - He was raised in a conservative environment, by a single mother who didn't model romantic affection or talk about healthy intimacy (whereas I was raised in a sex-positive household). Talking frankly and openly about this stuff is hard for him. There's a lot of pent-up Catholic guilt and shame. - He also has issues with vulnerability and abandonment from his childhood. The conflict we've had around sex has made him feel exposed and afraid that I will leave him, which are not apt to make him hungry for it. - He's had increasing difficulty getting or maintaining erections. Knowing how important sex is to me, and wanting to please me, it makes him feel like a failure. Anxiety that he'll have performance issues is, of course, self-perpetuating. It makes him even less keen on engaging in any kind of intimacy, and can come out in anger towards me for pursuing him (and thereby highlighting the ways he feels inadequate). - Some of the erectile issues may be related to the long-term effects of a hair loss drug he took when he was 18 (finasteride). It's unclear to me how much this is the case, as early in our relationship he didn't have these issues and was able to have sex practically daily. - We now both approach sex with so much baggage - him apprehensive of disappointing me, me with the pain of repeated rejection - that it's not, well, sexy anymore. If we do have sex, it's not very passionate - it feels like we're both holding parts of ourselves back for fear of getting hurt. This is in stark contrast to our relationship outside the bedroom, which is very affectionate, kind, open, and loving. I've been reading about ""sensate focus"" as a way to reintroduce touch gradually without putting too much pressure on either partner and without the emphasis on orgasm. My hope is that it can help us hit the reset button and get out of the negative spiral of performance anxiety, and make touching each other ""sexy"" again as opposed to just platonic cuddles. Does anyone have experience with this approach? Any tips for making it successful? He has been truly great about acknowledging the validity of my desires and the importance of a sustainable sex life, but I know this stuff is so intimidating to him right now and I want this to be as un-scary as it can be for him.

157,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,I have no libido but still have sex. Heres why.,373,54eufh,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/54eufh/i_have_no_libido_but_still_have_sex_heres_why/,2016-09-25 22:13:27,"I'm an LLNL (28F) who lives with my boyfriend (28M) who is HL. We have been toegther 3 years. I have never had a libido. I never actively desire sex. If I look at an attractive man, I recognize that he is attractive and appreciate that in the same way I appreciate a beautiful painting. It's pleasing to the eye. If I masturbate, it's purely for stress relief and not to get off. I don't masturbate though. Once a year maybe. I have never craved sex or fantasized. I would pretty much consider myself asexual. Me and my partner still have an active and fulfilling sex life. He is high libido and would happily do it multiple times a day. I would happily live the rest of my days without it. What I recognize though, is that sex is an integral part of a romantic relationship. It is the glue that binds us emotionally, physically and spiritually. It is integral part of my partners happiness and self-image, and how he connects with me and with his own body. So barring injury, illness, personal tragedy or exhaustion, I have sex with my partner every day. I may not crave it, but I do enjoy it. Sometimes, with a bit of foreplay, I get stimulated and enjoy it physically, every so often I will actually climax. Not always. I always find it pleasant though, in the same way that I find it pleasant to read a book with a glass of wine, or going on a nature walk. Sometimes I enjoy it merely as a fun game, with no sexual pleasure but enjoying the physicality of it, like I might enjoy playing on a playground, wrestling, tickle fights, or riding a bike. Sometimes I enjoy it purely emotionally, as I love seeing him happy and experiencing pleasure, gazing deep into my eyes and I know he feels deeply connected to me in that moment. Sometimes I enjoy it purely spiritually as I focus on the fact that his body is within mine, and we hold eye contact and I think about the fact that we are two seperate souls who are coming together in complete vulnerability, naked and exposed and raw, living in our own tiny moment in time. I may not want or think about sex when I'm not in the midst of it, but I do not reject him because I can always find a new angle of appreciation for it and what it does for our relationship. It is an experience that is so much more than mere desire, and I do not allow the fact that my body and hormones have neglected to crave it stop me from finding enjoyment in the act. I will not deny myself and my partner its many gifts just because my body is wired differently than his. I know I will get hate from some LLs by saying, ""Don't feel like it? Do it anyway."" but that is honestly what works for me. Don't pretend to have earth shattering orgasms and feign horniness, but don't discount the idea entirely because you don't orgasm or feel horny. There is so much more that you could be getting out of it. Maybe you need to look at it from another angle, to see it in a different light. Give it a try, it wont hurt you ;) For those who are LL for circumstances such as trauma, mental/physical illness or injury, I won't even begin to understand that and I am not saying this would work for you. For those like myself who have no desire for sex but no real reason to be so averse to it, I hope it helps you with a different perspective."
158,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,My ongoing DB recovery story,16,566pjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/566pjl/my_ongoing_db_recovery_story/,2016-10-07 04:56:25,"My SO and I are currently working on recovering our DB. I wanted to post my story. Partially to give a different perspective but also to possibly gain insight from others. There is more to every story so Id be happy to answer questions or listen to suggestions. Our bedroom was not as dead as others Ive seen here. But Im sure it would have continued to get worse. I grew up in a sexually repressed home which was abusive in multiple ways. I learned you dont talk about sex. I was LL throughout most of my twenties. I was obese, had three kids in five years, my husband was emotionally and sexually abusive. I dealt with it for almost a decade. When I was 28 I snapped out of it. I grew a backbone for my kids. I enrolled in college, starting exercising, started eating right, and went to therapy. I lost 65 pounds and kicked my ex out a year later. Im now 35. I look great, feel great, and I am HL. Turns out I love sex, just not with him. My SO is 31. His libido naturally floats somewhere between LL and NL. He likes sex but he has his own hang-ups. He grew up in a religious home in a very small town. Growing up he was also taught that sex was shameful, something we dont discuss. During his relationship with his kids mom he was also LL and he said they never really tried to work on it. She shamed him and cheated multiple times. He dealt with it for years for his kids but eventually left her. We have been together almost five years. He is a wonderful person and I love him like crazy. The only problem was our DB. We were having sex once every 3-4 weeks. I would have preferred more from the beginning but never really spelled it out. I was NL at the time so I figured I could deal with it. But my libido steadily increased. I suddenly wanted sex all the time. One year ago I finally told him we had to fix it or I would have to leave. I still remember the look on his face. He had never said but he knew it was an issue. He said wed work on it. And we have been ever since. Discussing our sex life outside the bedroom is hard for my SO. Right away I wanted to have these big sex conversations with him but he seemed really uncomfortable with that. I didnt want sex to become that thing that we have to talk about once again. I wanted to keep it light and easier. So instead we have lots of smaller conversations. We text, make silly comments, and ask questions here and there. And then we go about our day. I work on not emasculating him and showing him that I want sex with *him*, not just sex in general. I have slowly seen his sexual confidence improve. I have forced myself to become more open with my needs. Ive also had to work on not always taking it personal when he doesnt want sex. Being a former LL has given me good insight. I know what it feels like to not want sex. I never wanted him to grow to hate my touch. I think my past experiences have helped me through some of my more difficult times. We are now having sex a few times a week. We are trying new positions and starting to talk about different kinks. Last week we talked about porn for the first time. Im more submissive (hard as a HL, in a db) and as he has become more comfortable he has become increasing more dominant. Which has made him want sex even more. I am really excited to continue playing with this. Overall I feel so much closer to him. I trust him more. I know he cares about me and what I need. We still have work to do. He travels for work so he is gone often, leaving horny little me home alone. This causes him a lot of anxiety after his previous relationship. Weve learned that anxiety causes him to withhold his feelings and not want sex. He is learning to keep this in check. Sometimes when we have sex it is obviously to just get it out of the way so we can do other things. But most of the time its not. I go between being true to myself and my needs and also recognizing that this is a process. I cant expect him to constantly go at my pace when I wasnt willing to continue going at his. Especially when he is so obviously trying. Learning to be vulnerable and trusting that the other person wont take advantage of that vulnerability has been key for us. Our mantra is As long as youre trying, Im here. "
159,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,New thoughts and things something to try,10,4zvs9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/4zvs9c/new_thoughts_and_things_something_to_try/,2016-08-28 05:28:23,"So here is my thought. A long while back, I heard a comedian (Marc Maron) talk abut the stages of a new relationship. Specifically, when the new couple hash out their emotional baggage, think he called it the ""reveal"" (first Boyfriend died, ""I hate my parents"", past history of being a bully in highschool...things you don't discuss with friends or family). That hung around in my head because every relationship that was even remotely serious that I was a part of had that event, usually just before or after sex. I now bring it up here mostly because of the_celebate_girl's post, here, stoked the coals; URL I've been with my wife 6 years total. In that time, I have only opened up and intentionally showed her something shameful (lack of a better work) about myself 4 times. twice was in the last couple months. With that rolling around, I now wonder if she felt like I Emotionally trusted her. I am the Male in the relationship. I keep a tight lid on my emotions. I've only ever once told her I'm scare about what's to come. I've never dug into how unstable I was in high school. I work in a high stress life/death job and I don't share how much that pressure sometimes keeps me awake. Looking back, there were so many places we could have connected emotionally, but I didn't need her to process my emotions, and now I wonder if that was part of our issue. She may not realize that she needs that vulnerability from me the same way I feel a need to look after her when she's sick. This brings me to my next point. ""Hysterical Bonding."" For those who don't know, This is when a spouse unloads the magnitude of the DB issue and how damaging it is, and is reciprocated with physical affection....for about a month/week. What if that bonding isn't spawned by a fear of losing their partner, but ushered in by the SO opening up themselves to show how hurt they are? We all agree that as rejection builds up, we tend close off emotionally. What if the only time I show my emotional bruises and secrets was when I was having ""A talk?"" Perhaps I am not providing one of the supports to our relationship. So I guess I have 2 questions. When you and your SO were first dating, did you have a ""Reveal"" moment? and Do you/Can you tell your wife (husband) things only he/she is allowed to know? Side note; obviously, I'm thinking this applies to my own personal life. I know a large percentage of you folk know this isn't the issue in your relationship. It's just something I haven't seen tossed around here."

First time poster. I've been lurking around reading these testimonies which I identify with so much, finally giving me the courage to share. My partner 41 F LL is a frequent redditer, so my anonymity is paramount. My SO and I have been together for 18 mos. I'm 40 M with HL. When we first met, both of us had been divorced for a couple of years and had lots of bad luck dating. I set expectations of what I was looking for in a partner, as did she. My biggest points were honesty, healthy sex life and loyalty. My Ex cheated on me, lied constantly and left my kids and I. At that point, my SO excitably agreed she wanted the same. When we first got together, we screwed like bunnies in heat. We only saw each other a few days a week but couldn't keep our hands off each other. Days off together could result in 5+ times a day and it was great. Sometimes nearly too much, but we enjoyed ourselves and each other. As we began to grow closer, she began to have emotional outbursts and would become disagreeable about the simplest things. I'm a very easygoing guy. Until I feel unappreciated, unloved and stepped on. Then the Asshole begins to fight back. I asked her to marry me. Because I do love her and truly thought we could get passed the problems. She said yes. Then things for worse. During her PMS she got so filled with Fury, Anger, Bitterness and resentment toward me for things I had nothing to do with. I became the scapegoat for every problem in her past. And the intimacy ceased. Sex became less and less frequent. Going from a few times a week, to a couple a month. Then once a month. Then less. We moved in together. It got worse. It all got exponentially worse. Every little thing I did incited a fight. I would be lambasted for usinh common phrases that most people wouldn't bar an eye to. Everything I did criticized. But when anything critical was said back, I was shamed and guilt tripped for days. Then the fighting began. I don't mean arguing. I mean, drunk, middle of the night screaming matches where horrible things were said to one another. She got physical, more than once. She tried to flip it on me, acting like she was scared when I was physically attacked several times. Things got wicked. Then I stopped the fighting. We stopped drinking and began working towards reconciliation and redemption of our relationship. We've had a few small slips since then, most of which were idiotic small arguments that were exaggerated by one or both of us. But the sex? Absent. Gone. A stinging reminder of a time long past. I've spoken to her on multiple occasions. She cited having no libido, not liking her appearance, not trusting me, not liking Me. So is this hopeless? Because I have a high sex drive. I may be middle aged but I look good and I can go toe to toe with someone half my age (as I have before). And she seems totally uninterested in changing a thing. And I crave the intimacy. I want that touch. I want the endorphin and adrenaline release. I want the closeness and the fun and the enjoyment. I miss every element. The tactile feel. The smells. The tasted. The sounds. The pleasure. The pain. The beauty of it all. The sheer vulnerability of being naked with someone and enjoying the wonderland of their body as they enjoy mine. I miss it with her. And she doesn't seem to care. God, that's depressing."

The recurring theme of how it gets good for a week or two then goes back was my story like many others. I kept expressing to her that intervals of 2 months wasn't healthy or helpful to me. I remember countless conversations with a list of excuses from her. Some so silly I began to question my attractiveness or even her fidelity. While i know she never cheated it kept me up at night. Having conversations with a lot of friends i realized this wasn't their experience with partners. I supposed that added to my fervor. Promises of intimacy were made and never fulfilled. So after three years of sexual encounters I can count on two hands (mostly pity or obligation sex) I told her I wanted a divorce. Well I was proud of myself and sure. I cried and felt better than I ever had. I felt like myself. I even got on tinder just to see if I was attractive to someone and I even got a few right swipes. Never acted on them. I did message an old acquaintance and something happened. Despite the time we both had fond memories. I was vulnerable and she was comfort. It was amazing, emotional, short lived, and amazingly painful. My vulnerability made me 1000 times more susceptible to pain. She had gone through a divorce and knew where I was. Despite sharing emotions she cut me loose to find myself. I thought I felt unwanted before. yikes. The storm will continue and no harbor shall be found. So DB friends, please don't make this mistake. If you are at the end and find the strength to end it, don't get involved with something too soon. Even if it is just sex as a release it will hurt. I wanted it, but was unready to be hurt again. Sometimes it isn't all it seems. Thanks for reading. I'm not here for judgement about my mistakes. TL;DR ended a DB with divorce but got emotional with someone too soon. Don't do it. "
163,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,How do you know when effort is genuine?,19,4myhwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/4myhwa/how_do_you_know_when_effort_is_genuine/,2016-06-07 21:05:06,"URL &lt;-- Why I came here and where I'm at now It's been 5 weeks since I decided to start saving to leave my husband. I still haven't told him my plan, I haven't asked him for anything, and I didn't issue any ultimatums. I haven't given or asked for any affection since then but I haven't rebuffed any affection he offers. It's been 3 weeks since he climbed out of the funk he was in that made me decide to leave. He's been consistently making plans for projects I've been wanting done for years, and following through. At first I thought he suspected that I was planning to leave and was doing choreplay to get me to stay so I didn't expect it to last more than a few days because he is, hands down, the laziest person I've ever known. I've been working side by side with him every day, and other than doing more things independently from him, I'm keeping to the status quo. He's also been more verbally affectionate, using pet names when it's just us, instead of only in front of others. He seems genuinely disappointed when I don't do the same, or when I don't kiss him goodnight or goodbye. He'll sit next to me without leaning away, and he won't tense up if I brush past him. The most surprising thing is that he's started making racy innuendos out of the blue, which is something that we used to do often until the last few years. I don't know how to respond to any of this because I don't know if it's genuine effort on his part, or just manipulation. On the one hand, these are all small changes in the scheme of things, and come no where near the level of participation and intimacy that I want, but on the other hand, it's been 10 years since we were truly a connected couple, and I'm sure that makes the small things seem huge in terms of vulnerability. He also hasn't been this consistent for this long with anything else since he quit drinking, which is the main reason I think it's the tiniest bit possible this could be for real. I'm not sure that genuine effort would change my plan to leave at this point, and if I can't commit to staying I don't want to lead him on. When it comes to communication, he's like a skittish cat, I can't come directly at him or he will vehemently resist and run, so I have to coax things out of him. In spite of everything I honestly love him and I don't want to cause him any more pain. I'm really at a loss for what to do. If he's really trying should I just leave now to spare him? My only option would be to spend a few months sleeping at the walk in shelter, provided they have room on any given night. Or should I keep stashing money away and see how this plays out? TL;DR ------------------------------------------------------------------- Decided to start on exit plan, haven't told husband, but he started making positive changes which are totally uncharacteristic of him, don't know if it's genuine or not. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Edit: 6/6/16 8:21pm CST Thank you all! I was really looking at this sudden change in my husband as being some kind of reset behavior, I think because I'm too afraid to hope. All your responses surprised and enlightened me. I think that I'm going to continue under the assumption that I'm leaving, and continue to squirrel away money and make arrangements, but I'm not going to close myself off to the possibility that my husband might be for real this time. I still worry that I might be taking advantage of him, but realistically, my plan already needed a year to complete, so I might as well stay and see what happens."

Sure, things are vastly improved and it feels like we mostly have a workable and good relationship. The problem is still sexual contact. She's said she wants things to progress naturally, as physical (non-sexual) touch has. Heck, she laid with her butt against mine and I about fainted from shock. At least I was already laying down! Not to mention her laying her head against my side and getting ""upset"" when I shifted position. I know vulnerability is so hard for her. She camouflages so much of it under ulterior motives. She has years of making herself hate me to get over too..... She has asked me to please not pressure her and she's happy with herself for the progress she's made. Indeed she's mostly back to the woman I fell for those years ago. But, that woman also desired me, damn it! I've changed a lot lately too. More self care. More boundaries. More outside interests. Less neediness for her to meet every need I have. More independence again. Exercising. Lifting. I feel (mostly) like a man again. My confidence is coming back, it's hampered by this entire situation, but managing to come back despite it, somehow. Yet the situation is thus: Should good faith and consideration of all the progress of late be enough to overcome a date we mutually set to be intimate again by? She's said she doesn't know if we'll get ""there"" in time, but hopes I'd take everything else into consideration. Hmmm... I'm not sure she'd respect me, or I'd respect myself if I let a concrete date, simply slide by. Ugh......"
165,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,Initiating after prolonged and/or contentious DB,9,4p9dpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/4p9dpw/initiating_after_prolonged_andor_contentious_db/,2016-06-22 16:59:45,"I've been thinking a lot about this the past few days. In the context of my own DB, in which we are both HL, I am the one being denied sex and intimacy and my husband is the one denying. Having every attempt at sex, and nearly every attempt at intimate affection, denied for 10 years I am angry, resentful, bitter, and have an almost phobic fear of rejection. I just can't bring myself to initiate *anything* anymore. I can't bring myself to trust that ""this time"" it will work. It's like each time I allow myself to be vulnerable the rejection hurts more than the time before. Today I've told a few people here that I am an emotional sponge, I end up absorbing and feeling what I *perceive* the people around me feel. I can't help but go out of my way to try and understand the oppositions point of view. Lately that has made me wonder if my husband also has a lack of trust and fear of vulnerability because of the years of contention surrounding the DB. Knowing him as well as I do, I know that he will not allow himself to be vulnerable unless there is complete and total trust. So, what if I am mistaken about why he won't have sex with me, what if the real reason our DB continues is because neither of us can break the barrier and make a move? Which is actually a completely rhetorical question, I'm just using my situation anecdotally. My real questions are, whether you are being denied, or you are the one denying, what would you want from your partner to make it easier for you to initiate? And what would you give your partner to make it easier for them to initiate?"
166,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,"34M, married to 33F with kids. Infrequent sex. We both want it but I'm not enough for her.",16,439dx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/439dx6/34m_married_to_33f_with_kids_infrequent_sex_we/,2016-01-30 03:01:19,"I'm 34, my wife is 33 and we've been together for about 13 years (7 pre marriage). We've got two young kids and we're homeowners and have solid careers going. We are pretty much best friends and we make each other happy for the most part. Everything in our relationship is good... except for sex. It has always been the one area where we aren't fully ""compatible"". If I had to give my ideal situation, I'd love to have sex with her 2-3 times a week. Not necessarily daily, because I tend to want sex more after having gone without it for a day or two. I tend to gravitate towards a relatively vanilla style of sex. I am mostly turned on by visuals and the sight and feel of her body because she has the ideal body I want in a sexual partner. At this point, we've had sex 2 times in the past 4 months. During those months, I've started working at a new job, we've moved to a new house, are in the process selling our old house, and have been raising our 2 toddlers with relatively little outside support, so we haven't really had many opportunities to have sex (and when we do have time, we are usually so tired that we still don't). That being said, the problem is not just a matter of having enough opportunities to have sex. It's more fundamental. I am definitely sexually attracted to her, and for the most part she is attracted to me. Sometimes I find it easier to express my desires for her, but other times I have trouble saying it in a serious, sexy way that she can fully appreciate. I have found some non-verbal ways of showing my affection, but they aren't always received well because she's not always receptive to physical touch. Sex tends to happen more when it's organic and/or spontaneous. She sometimes has trouble getting into the mood if we talk about it before hand and there is anticipation before we actually get into bed with each other. But by the same token, she sometimes needs to psych herself up beforehand and get herself in the mood or else she might shut down when we start to get into it. She has dealt with anxiety, depression and self-image issues for much of her adult life, so she has defense mechanisms that can kick in and prevent her from opening herself up to me and showing vulnerability if she doesn't feel comfortable. When things do click between us, the sex is great and fun and we both enjoy it. Of course, having kids makes everything that much more tricky, because they are constantly nearby, demanding our attention, so we have even fewer opportunities to really connect. She has much more of a cerebral, intellectual sexuality that focuses on narratives, sexual intent and subverting the traditional expectations and roles of sex. She prefers sex that involves an element of experimentation, investigation and intellectual curiosity. For her, it's not so much of a basic desire to have sex as much as it is a desire to explore the different feelings and ideas she has about sex, and see where it can take her in terms of her finding her own identity and figuring out what kind of sex she really enjoys, because the majority of her sexual history hasn't really broken the surface of what she really wants to experience. It's not just a physical act for her, it's an exercise in self-discovery, self-expression and pushing herself out of her comfort zone. I have tried to be more experimental on a few occasions, and in some aspects I have become a better lover (at least I've found that I enjoy doing more kinds of sex acts than what I originally thought) but overall it's just not enough and I haven't been able to do it consistently because it takes a lot of effort on my part to really stay focused and keep myself in that mindset. My sexuality tends to be much more instinctual, with not much thought involved. I compare it to flavors of ice cream. I love a few of her flavors A LOT and I really enjoy them. If she wants that particular flavor as well then we're both happy and we have a great time together. But she only wants those particular flavors part of the time. The rest of the time, she's thinking about all the other flavors out there that she's never had the chance to try, and she really, really wants to try them. At this point in her life, she is feeling like she has entered her sexual prime, and has a very strong desire to explore what's out there. She feels more adventurous and bold than ever before and she wants to challenge herself. She has always had a relatively fluid sexuality and gender-identity, and she really wants to reach out and grab those new experiences and make them her own. If I had to categorize myself I guess i'd say I'm a monogamist with an open mind. She is more oriented towards polyamory (but having never done it, she's not 100% sure about what she really wants). We have discussed it at length and talked about how we both feel. I want to be supportive of her and I wish I could provide her with what she needs, and up until recently, I think I held out a naive hope that I would someday be able to be enough for her, or that we'd at least find some middle ground where we can both be at least semi-satisfied. But at this point, I've conceded that I just can't fulfill her desires in an authentic way, because she doesn't just want to try new things, she also wants to discuss them and deconstruct them with her partner to figure out how she feels about them before moving onto something else that is new and challenging. She wants a sexual partner who can share in not just the physical but also the intellectual pursuit of sexual discovery. It's fucking depressing, but it's the truth. I think I've finally come to terms with the finality of it. I know that the sooner I let myself feel the sadness that comes with it and allow myself to mourn the death of that ideal life where we're both enough for each other, the sooner I can move on and try to meet the challenge of facing my own doubts, fears and anxieties about her being with other people. I have tried to educate myself on what it means to be polyamory and/or have an open marriage, and what it would really entail on a practical level. If I really consider it, I think I could be ok with her being with other people as long as I felt like I had an equal chance to do it myself, and as long as it never did anything to encroach on our family life and relationship at home. But then my doubts and fears start to creep in. I can't help but think ""It will be so much easier for her to find partners than me. I'll be left behind, feeling dumb, boring and inadequate while she gets to experience everything the world has to offer!"" It comes from my lack of confidence and I am aware of that, but it's still hard to not feel those doubts and worries. Of course, the only way to really find out would be to actually try it and see how it goes. I just don't know how I'd deal with the feelings of jealousy and sadness that would come along with it. It seems like such a foreign concept to me, yet to her it's second nature. For her, sex is just another way of interacting with people. It's a tool that can be used to work out all of her personal feelings about her own sexuality and gender identity, and deal with those aspects of her mind and personality that she hasn't been able to address in any other ways. For her, there is a clear distinction between a sexual relationship she'd have with another person and the relationship she has with me. For her, it seems like she is confident that she would be able to keep the two separate and not have one affect the other. I know she still has her own doubts and worries and anxiety, but her desire to give it a try overpowers them, along with her desire to do it while she's still young and has the sex drive. She also just simply hasn't had the chance to try any of it before, so she doesn't even really know what exactly it is that she's looking for. She's just determined that she won't be able to get it from me (at least not in a genuine way. It would just be me putting on an act for her benefit, not because I have a genuine interest in doing it as well). In the end, I just think about what the alternative is. Divorce is pretty much a non-option as far as we're both concerned, so it would mean we'd remain in a monogamous and unhappy sexual relationship in which she's ultimately unfulfilled, and therefore would resent having sex with me because I get what I want but she doesn't get what she wants. Compared to that, embarking on a new, scary part of our lives together in the world of polyamory and/or an open marriage seems like it might actually be doable, and the potential positive impact it might have on our own sex life is really intriguing. Ideally, if she felt like she had the freedom to be the sexual person she wants to be, it would also make her feel more open to being sexual with me, and it would eliminate many of the things that get in the way of us coming together. It could, in fact, make our marriage stronger than ever. I weight that against the unknowns and it seems like it might be worth the risk. I don't really know what this post is for other than me needing to express what I'm feeling. I don't have anyone to talk to about this in my life and right now I'm just feeling really sad and shitty about it. I don't blame her and I don't blame myself because I know that it's just the way we're both wired. At this point, I just feel like it's on me to take that emotional risk and be vulnerable for her sake, because it would make the biggest contribution towards her figuring out who she is and in turn having that benefit all of us. If you've made it this far, thanks for reading."

I have long, thick hair, am very slender, am fit and active, I shave, I look my best. Men notice me, a lot actually. It can't be that I'm conventionally unattractive, or let myself go. I don't smell, I have manners, I'm not some boorish, obnoxious monstrosity, hell, you even told me yourself that I'm beautiful and cute! Yet... I feel like I could weigh 150kg instead of 56 because in both cases, you won't sexually touch me with a ten foot pole. It doesn't matter. Is it that I have an A cup? Am I *too thin*? But you knew that when you started out with me and you had a lot of opportunity to end it. Movies and parties are awkward. In basically any movie or series there's a sex scene. Regardless of whether they're good or not, I feel awkward and embarrassed watching it. Yes, *she* is getting some, her, not me. Look at what we're totally not doing but is completely normal and expected! Oh hear the moans, see the enjoyment. Yup, we're not doing that! A shame that you can't really silence the elephant in the room away, otherwise we'd do great. Monty Python's *The Meaning Of Life* became even awkward and painful to watch because of the sex references. We don't need a rubber, and look at what those other people laugh about as a daily part of our life that we don't have... Whatsoever. I've never been heavy on the sex jokes but in any party with adults you'll have the jokes and references. I can only beg in my mind to please change subject. Laughing and joking about it as though it's something that *I* do, and isn't a thing that only *other people* do, as normal yet awesome things that are a different world to me now, that I have no part in. And also, the comment that sex can cause UTIs as someone recently said to me as I was discussing some issues down there, also stings for all the wrong reasons. I feel shut out, like you put up a wall and didn't give me any insight into how or what and refuse to help me along. You left me with this great, epic rejection, burdened me with your complete and utter lack of desire and I'm just to fend for myself, to somehow figure this out. You complicate my life and what we have, leave this burden on me, refuse all my attempts at reaching out and don't do anything to help me yourself. Just more mystery, just more exclusion and shutting out. Maybe the biggest rejection and exclusion is the fact that you won't help me along. That part of you, me and us has been cut out. I cannot touch it, explore it, or get closer to you in that sense. You shut me out, that's how it feels. I have been rejected big time. The first times that you did, it made me feel very ashamed and embarrassed, like I was a hippo attempting ballet. My advances fell so flat unexpectedly that it made me feel a bit ridiculous, as in, what am I thinking? WHAT is so undesirable and off-putting about me? But I quickly realized that I would not allow you to make me insecure or make me feel like there was something really wrong with me, leading to a suffocated confidence and nagging self-doubt. No, this is on you. Yet it still has effect. I feel a bit ridiculous when thinking about myself as a sexual being in relation to you because I feel like ""what are you/am I thinking? You silly girl, you're somehow not good or sexy enough"" I don't want to make passive aggressive slights, I don't want to give you backhanded insults, I won't make a hateful or frustrated comment out of the blue. As I dislike passive aggression, I feel that my behavior should be better than that but many things trigger comments and thoughts that I don't utter or express, but damn, you make it difficult. Doesn't it occur to you that I may have difficulty with vulnerability? Every time I express a desire, express my needs, show that I'm also a sexual being, that I want *that* side of you, I make myself vulnerable and open up. Discussing this causes me stress and you're not helping me one bit. I'll take one for the team and continue to work on this but it's that same burden that has been dropped on me in a way- go fix it, I'll leave you with no hints. That's how it feels at least. And then you make a very half asses attempt at fingering me. There I am, lying next to a man being horny, yet all that happens is that he rubs my clit a bit. He'll do that, but not more. Like I'm just too hideous or gross. Like I'm not even an option. Like I'm sexually invisible. I needed to vent. Sorry for shitty phrasing, English is my second language."

I'm a 34HLF, married to a 30LLM who is, at best, deeply conflicted about his sexual identity and very possibly asexual. He's always been honest about this: no bait and switch here. That deep vulnerability is something I respect and love about him. BUT. I think I could deal with occasional sex, even once every 6-8 weeks, if we had other intimate outlets. It's been over three weeks since he's last kissed me. Plenty of very platonic hugs complete with hips angled away and friendly back pats and plenty of subtle distancing when I try to initiate anything more. He's not being unkind or overtly hurtful, but it's devastating nonetheless to go from having barely enough to nothing. I'm masterfully adept at coming up with justifications for why I need to be more patient and self-sacrificing: he's a recovering opiate addict, he's emotionally and physically fragile, he's not feeling well again, the winter blues have set in... there's always a reason and at the bottom of it all, I'm really afraid it's me; and not just the fear that he's not attracted to me. I mean me as in, I'm so messed up that I choose to be with the one man who is able to nurture all my most insidious insecurities: horrendous body image, tendency to equate sex with love, anxiety and depression, eating disorder, fear of failure and abandonment, saviour complex... I just want to get back to my 80 hour work weeks so I can deaden all this pain. It's obviously not a solution, but spending this much time with him, while I have incessantly craved it, hurts. It hurts. so. much. I want to feel connected, cherished, loved. And I just feel empty. More alone with him than without, but too fucking afraid of hurting him to have the Talk again, allow him to see me crying myself to sleep again, or leave. I am so grateful for everyone who posts here. You all make me feel a little less alone."

It was rough. Really fucking rough. Point of wanting (and almost attempting) suicide. Anyone who thinks a dead bedroom is just a lack of sex couldn't be more detached from the reality of emotional bonding and what a relationship is supposed to be. We did intensive couples therapy for about two months. Twice a week for three hours each time. It did very little other than make me feel VERY grounded and ok with how things were. It gave my lady a bit of perspective of her misplaced perspective on things, but it really didn't do the fixing. It's only been fixed for about two-three months, we'll see how it ends, but the fact that I can't keep track that ""it's been four and a half weeks since she gave me a 'bored out of my mind' hand job"" is a fantastic sign IMHO. Sex just isn't at all that important to me anymore... because she's offering and wanting sex frequently. It's become one of the least important items in our relationship for each of us, because I'm taken care of and she knows whatever happens is ok. Here's my personal story, it may be beneficial for others, if not I really don't care. :) * 1- Resentment: I gave up on resentment. I eventually just gave up caring about it and actually trusted her that she wasn't wanting to be a frigid bitch... but she was just feeling that way. So rather than playing ""Mr. Nice Guy"" but secretly treating her like a frigid bitch, I actually treated her like my wife that is hurting as much as I in this scenario. She was hurting because... * 2- Expectations: She constantly felt it wasn't good enough, that I was judging her sexual performance, or hoping for more. One of the best experiences was a moderately fulfilling quickie one day. She wanted to make sure I wasn't going to be disappointed or wanting more that night. I was cool with it; it was no big deal. We had fun, let's get the rest of our obligations done today. It took about ten times of having intercourse for her to feel it was always, truly good enough. * 3- Moping: This killed it for her every day. She felt constantly blamed and secretly attacked when I was sad and moping about the house. This was caused by her passive aggressive mom IMHO. To this day, the woman will hang up on her daughter and not talk to her for weeks if some slight occurs (e.g. paying more attention to her father rather than her mother). So, communication saved this one. She asked if I was mad at her, if not I'd tell her what was going on, if yes we'd talk about it and move on (but we didn't EVER have to fix it.... EVER). * 4- Validating Feelings: I was raised in a ""fix it"" family. We always would try to help others not have to feel a certain way. That's not healthy. Sometimes people need to just feel sad and that be ok. I always felt I was failing as a husband if I couldn't give her a happy life. She then felt bad for feeling a certain way and not being accepted. Validating her feelings freed both of us from this cycle. It's much more than the hilarious ""It's not about the nail"" video. If anyone wants resources let me know and I can try to send some stuff... but this one sometimes requires professional help and a lot of practice. * 5- Desire: Paramount to all of this was she had to want to have sex again. She says it's because I stopped expecting sex, and expecting it to be great and have been happier. I disagree, but it doesn't matter. My perspective is she started being more sexual and then I didn't have any expectations being unfulfilled and that made me happier! :) Regardless of the order of things, we both had to desire to change things. Whether it was that I finally gave up my resentment and stubbornness and accepted her or if she just accepted that sex is a healthy and wonderful thing in a relationship is kind of moot. It just worked. But we both wanted to love and accept each other more and have fun together outside of anything sexual. Honestly, at this point she's wanting it more than I do. It's weird. We've had some of the craziest, passionate sex in the past few months... and then gone about our day... with her wanting it again soon! Other factors; our life's stress level has plummeted (moving, in-laws issues, etc.). She's also relented on her religious neurosis; after I told our pastor I didn't believe half the crap he was saying and he was cool with it she finally believed me that we don't have to be perfect within Christianity and we won't be ostracized for being honest. I've also been very honest with her about what I want, don't want, think, feel, etc. even to the point of tell her ""that's a cute swimsuit, but the other ones look better on you"". We've had a few blow ups, a few fights, and given each other space and come back together just fine without any drama. A few KEY items to keep in mind: * Red Pill is absolute trash. Yes, don't be a complete doormat (beta) but don't be a douche either (alpha). Just be you and be confident in you. That goes male or female. Red Pill mythology is based on simple factual concepts that are misconstrued to make women look like the most vapid creatures on earth. Any man who's met a woman knows they are much more complicated than that... because they are at the very least a fellow human being. * ""They're just not attracted to you"" is a correct principal but once again applied incorrectly. Two years ago I was at about 10% body fat (not bad for a desk-jockey), benching 2.5x body weight, squatting 750+ LBs and fit as a fiddle. She didn't want me at all. I'm back to close to 27% body fat and she can't keep her hands off of me. I'm not repulsive, I am still an attractive man. A ""dadbod"" with some very solid muscle structure comfortably wrapped in comfort food. The point; attraction doesn't mean appearance. Reducing your spouse down to someone who only sees you for your body only increases the distance between each other and causes you to chase an shade of yourself that still won't be fulfilled sexually or appreciated emotionally. Attraction doesn't mean looks. * Vulnerability between partners and trust is paramount. Trust exercises are important. Being vulnerable about even stupid things is crucial. Yesterday I mentioned I wanted to ski faster and it hurt her feelings. We talked about it and everything was fine quickly. We all moved on. She was able to be vulnerable, I was about to be honest, but she also trusted me when I said ""I love skiing with you, sometimes I just like to go fast is all."" This could at anytime implode; I'm not saying it's completely fixed. But I think we can all use some positivity on this sub-reddit and I'm hoping this does that."
170,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,"My heart hurts, too.",17,3t1rt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/3t1rt3/my_heart_hurts_too/,2015-11-17 05:22:36,"I was going to post with that title line, but someone beat me to it today -- and that doesn't make me feel any better. Misery may love company, but I am not happier because there are other people out there suffering as I am, nor do I feel any better because there are other HL women out there in dead bedrooms. Yesterday morning, I began to cry after he left the bed. I [HL/F/51] am incredibly sad because we've had sex five times in the past year. I couldn't help the tears. I didn't time it, plan it, or even want it to happen. I tried to muffle my cries; I don't use my emotions as a weapon. I would have given anything to keep it inside until I got back to my own place, to let it go in my own home. He [LL/M/47] came into the bedroom and asked what was wrong. ""I miss you,"" I said. He said, ""Okay,"" then left the room. I know he never wants to talk about the lack of sex. He is dealing with a significant trauma that predates our two-year relationship. I don't want to make him feel worse for it. He has told me repeatedly that it's his fault, not mine. He's worked really hard on being emotionally available to me in the last year. We cuddle. He makes sure that we get naked contact in bed when I'm there (even without the sex) because I am very tactile. He has gone from withdrawing for days at a time to getting back to me when I text or call. I appreciate all of that, and tell him so repeatedly. I cannot help that I miss the sex. When I got up, I tried to tell him how I was feeling without any blame. I just want him to know that it's really hard for me, that sex is a means of deepening and strengthening our emotional bond and that I miss that specific type of intimacy. What I tried to convey -- and failed -- is that I feel really isolated in this. I never initiate the conversation because it always leads to a fight, and I never initiate sex because it always leads to rejection -- yet I want to know that we're in this together, that he knows that this affects me. I'm not blaming him. I've never blamed him. There are genuine, extenuating circumstances and I'm thrilled with the rest of the work that he's done to improve our relationship. This one thing, though, makes me feel so isolated because he never alludes to it, talks about it, or asks how I'm doing. Never. I understand after yesterday how painful it is for him to discuss this with me. He also seems to think that I'm desiring orgasms. I'm not. I can give those to myself. This is not a superficial, get-me-off thing; I want to feel the vulnerability that I need to feel with my partner, whether either of us gets off or not. And so, today, my heart hurts. A lot. He became defensive even though I didn't attack him. He lashed out at me because he was in so much pain. (Trust me when I say that the trauma produced a lot of legitimate pain.) He refused to listen to me when I told him repeatedly that the solution isn't sex but communication. He told me that the fight was a ""tape loop"" of his ""failure"" -- and he refused to believe me when I told him that I would never, ever categorize him as a failure. Predictably, his lashing out was pointed and painful. He laid the whole fight at my feet. He told me repeatedly that I had ""shit timing"" and ""shit delivery,"" yet it was clear that there is *never* a good time or method by which to talk about this. He also laid at my feet the emotional pain from the previous trauma that surfaced because of the fight. And he was angry that I showed him how I was feeling at all, I think. Before we parted, I asked him -- in light of all the hurtful things he hurled at me -- why he was with me at all. ""Because you're worth it,"" was his answer. I don't know what that means anymore. He has had to do a lot of work on himself to be in this relationship to begin with, and he's had to do a lot of work on himself to sustain this relationship. I have not expected anything beyond what anyone expects in a committed, long-term relationship: emotional availability, honesty, commitment, intimacy. Even though he tried to make me feel as though that was all jumping through hoops to be with me, I pointed out to him that he had the choice of whether or not he wanted to work on progressing, on becoming a mentally healthier (post-trauma, that is) person. I never forced him to do anything. I never issued any ultimatums. I pointed out that anything he's done, he's done of his own free will. The end result, though, seems to be his huge emotional pain, a rawness (to use his word) that I think he needs to experience to some extent to work through. (It's related to that trauma.) I don't want to be perceived as the one causing his pain, though, because I would never do anything deliberately to hurt him or to exacerbate that very profound wound of his. I've been the most supporting person anyone can be. And in the end, though, I'm in pain, too. His pain is too deep, his self-inflicted and unnecessary shame and guilt so great, that he is blind to all else in this regard. My pain? Immaterial. My insistence that I'm not blaming him? Nonexistent. My need to feel as though we are in this aspect of the relationship together? Also immaterial because he doesn't see the sex problem as a communication problem. My heart hurts so much today. I love this man. I am not yet ready to contemplate being without him. I don't know when we'll talk again. I hate that I hurt him, but I hate too that he couldn't just say to me, ""I know you're going through this with me. It's going to be okay."" Because, in the end, that is all I really needed. **tl;dr** I didn't mean to become emotional yesterday but I did, and the man that I love more than any living creature took it as an attack. Today, he's in a world of hurt and there's not a thing I can do. And my heart hurts a lot, too. "
171,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,It's not supposed to be like this,45,3oblmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/3oblmc/its_not_supposed_to_be_like_this/,2015-10-11 22:41:25,"Last night. Two years of starfish and excuses. I cracked. It had overwhelmed me- I had been shredded of my own self. Caught in a broken design. I had cried and old remnants of the past swept through me. God I missed her. I missed her fervour, her enthusiasm. I wondered how things became so complex. I remarked on the endless struggle of being hopelessly in love with her while not being allowed to touch. Rules and regulations have left me a slobbering mess. I used to be so sure of myself. A happy and charming man. A grounded soul who loved his children and wife. I don't feel anymore. I don't want this, I never pictured my life like this. I am so helpless here- you are everything to me. Why can't you let me express this? Years of beautiful harmony reduced to nothing. You can't see how much this emasculates me. I hate feeling so apologetic afterwards. How you just want it over and you're attempts to mask it and fake some sort of enthusiasm cripple me further. I can't think of anything else. Talking about it only increases the span of my vulnerability. I have caught myself looking outside the marriage. It shouldn't be like this. You callously spout that it is only sex. Only a tiny aspect. That the years before could never match to the years to come. That I should leave you be, that it is only natural. You shift all the blame. You tell me that we have sex plenty. The monthly call of duty shrinks me to the point I'd rather not have it. The rejection has sapped me of what I was. I love you. But I have to look out for myself. I have to get out of this mess."
172,vulnerability,DeadBedrooms,How my wife's past abuse and my sexual issues have affected our marriage,5,309h8f,http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/309h8f/how_my_wifes_past_abuse_and_my_sexual_issues_have/,2015-03-26 02:49:49,"After writing this, I'm not sure if this even belongs here... We started dating 8 years ago and been married for 5. Sure we've had our short phases of great intimacy, but the majority of our time has been a DB. I'll be sharing my wife's issues and then mine. It's important to preface that her father was and is still mostly emotionally absent in her life. She shared with me early on in our relationship that she was raped by a family friend when she was an adolescent. I was the first person she had ever told and she has only shared it with a therapist and support group since. Then just a few years ago she told me about an inappropriate relationship she had as a teen. Again it was her first time sharing with someone. It was another family friend more than a decade older than her. She said she genuinely felt desired and loved, and it became sexual. Luckily, she felt it was wrong and broke it off when she moved out of state for college. She claims that he was incredibly heartbroken by it, but in my opinion these are the markings of grooming and not genuine love. She has not shared it with a therapist and she has never fully processed through it. Today, she is having many self-image issues, emotional blocks during sex, and feelings of being undesired by me. The most painful part is that she still sometimes misses those feelings with that man. I'll admit that my desire for her has deteriorated because physical intimacy, as I have learned, is very important to me. Plus eating has been one of her coping methods and she has gained some weight so there's less attraction now. On my side of the aisle, I have always struggled with pornography addiction. My mother abandoned the family while I was at a young age and I have an incessant need to be desired by a woman, mainly physically. I never received proper counseling before meeting my wife. Well those feelings unchecked eventually led me to commit adultery a few years ago. I don't want to blame her because the choices I made were mine to make. Two years ago, I confessed to her and we've been hard at work to put our marriage back together. This included therapy, support groups, and a lot of other support which we still continue somewhat today. But the wounds are still there and it has only made her feel less desired by me. Unfortunately, as the busyness of life took over (including our first child and house), I slipped into my old ways again in the past 9 months and cheated yet again. A part of me believed that more things added to our life would help solidify our commitment, but it has only made it more difficult to leave. Stupid me. Again, I can only blame myself for my choices and have to deal with my issues with sexual addiction. I have yet to confess to my recent activity and know that I eventually have to. I'm almost certain that it will end us. All this to say that both of our baggage has been a terrible combination. Her vulnerability and my addiction is what first drew us together, and now it's driving us apart. We have been continuing the marriage therapy consistently, but it doesn't help when I keep lying about recovery and she never properly heals through that one relationship. I don't know if there's any advice out there for me. I'm pretty sure it's only divorce at this point. I'm absolutely terrified of what will be lost if we divorce...friends, family, house, and our child. But please if anything, read this story as fair warning of how important it is to see professional therapists BEFORE getting married for any addictions or past abuse you may have."
