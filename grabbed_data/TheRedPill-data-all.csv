0,vulnerability,TheRedPill,PSA: Your frame dies when the Inner Children die.,1,hq6ngj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/hq6ngj/psa_your_frame_dies_when_the_inner_children_die/,2020-07-13 11:56:19,"Ah yes, welcome to another one of my epiphanies I had, brought to you by an anonymous account I meant to throw away but Reddit wont let me on TRP from my actual account. :) Lets cut to the chase, shall we? When a woman is with the right man; an alpha she is comfortable with, she feels free to express herself. After all, you have to build this level of trust and *sense of safety* with a girl for her to be comfortable enough to express her body and her sexuality with you, Captain Protector. And the same goes for you, mister man. Tit for tat; you are an alpha because you know you are the shit and you are comfortable with yourself and your own skin, and you feel safe enough to do this. (Protip: Lifting is great if you have anxiety.) And thus comfortable with your own sexuality and vulnerability. Hence the quid pro quo. See where Im going with this? You and her are just people that are having a fun time, enjoying each others company, different forms of expressions, bodies and sexuality. Vulnerable together yet stronger feeding off one another, the union is made. A bond no different than horny children having fun together. My days browsing asktrp, I saw many posters asking if they fucked up or whether their frame is wrong, blah blah blah. Look man; if you have to ask, then yes, you *subconsciously* already know that you fucked up. Let my post be here to save you the time of seeking validation. Either you or her were backed into a position where you lost that sense of comfort to express your inner child, and are now stuck in a corner of repression and/or anxiety. Acknowledge it, own it, learn and move on. That said, let me serve you some fresh hot science, brothers. For starters, if youre being confident and truly expressing a DGAF attitude, you are expressing your inner child, I.e. being authentic, congruent with your personality, true confidence, etc. After breaking down any shit test/ego defense/resistance walls from the girl, if any, then you should reach this core of her personality as well. Behold, the centerpiece of one anothers angels and demons. That may, perhaps be another post. But this core is the Inner Child; it is the true you, the true her, the oblivious innocence of ones personality that was imprinted from and expressed since ones innocent youth and will be carried on for the rest of their lives. Many young men and women alike fall to the tragedy of the repression/death of this Inner Child. Be it ones work life, a crappy LTR, loss of or abuse from family, incompatible safe spaces, (que tribalism explained) etc. Ones innocence dies and many never recover this inner child. Thats not to say its hopeless. If you are stuck in a pit of negative emotion, you can redeem it. There are many resources online that you may look into; both on The Red Pill and perhaps even some writings from students of Carl Jung or the man himself. But connecting with ones own soul is generally a journey that is unique to each individual, I cant tell you how to do this. I digress. Wanna know why good ole Mother Nature and papa God designed it that way? Think about it. Sex is a natural function of reproduction, therefor produces children. If you feel safe; she feels safe enough to express that inner child, sexuality and all, then behold, the cosmos say you two are compatible to have children. And if its safe enough for your soul, then its safe enough for kids. That is the natural purpose of the Inner Child, and will be the source of social imprinting of your own biological legacy as well. And so the cycle of human evolution goes on to evolve another generation of children growing into adult children. Rinse and repeat. So along your journey of self-improvement, between working hard and lifting, make sure you spend time getting in touch with yourself, and have some fun. But not too much fun. Unless you have lotion; keeps the friction burns away.  Stay safe, kings."
1,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Creating a Sexual Vibe in Your Tinder Profile: Body Language Analysis,1,hqj2fn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/hqj2fn/creating_a_sexual_vibe_in_your_tinder_profile/,2020-07-14 02:58:25,"One of the biggest mistakes that I see while reviewing Tinder profiles is failure to create a *sexual Alpha vibe.* I realize this concept sounds extremely esoteric and woo-woo magical, but I'm going to do my best to break it down into something more concrete. **In this post, I will examine facial cues that telegraph Alpha and Beta vibes in pictures.** # The Split-Second First Impression Here I will share two images. The first is of [Aziz Ansari](URL The second is of [Russell Brand](URL For those of you who don't know, both of these guys are famous comedians. Click on both of these pictures and look at them for a second. Ansari is known publicly for his ""woke"" attitude, nice guy persona, and support of feminism, and ironically got caught up in a #MeToo scandal due to Blue Pill beliefs. Brand is famous for his outrageous behavior, ""misogyny,"" and smashing a ton of models and other hotties over the years. Ansari is a Beta male. Brand is an Alpha male. But you knew that instinctively. I didn't need to tell you anything about their background. You inferred their positions in the sexual hierarchy, immediately and subconsciously, from body language and facial expression. We evolved these instincts over millions of years. Although the idea of a ""first impression"" is just common sense wisdom, modern science has shown that it is all too real. We make sweeping judgments about a person [within a fraction of a second](URL The thought is in our brain well before we're consciously aware of it. &amp;#x200B; &gt; A series of experiments by Princeton psychologists Janine Willis and Alexander Todorov reveal that **all it takes is a tenth of a second to form an impression of a stranger from their face, and that longer exposures dont significantly alter those impressions** (although they might boost your confidence in your judgments). Their research is presented in their article First Impressions, in the July issue of *Psychological Science*. # Body Language Cues Let's go back to Ansari. What, exactly, about his look telegraphs Beta? First and foremost are the eyes. If you Google Ansari, almost every picture shows his eyes opened almost comically wide. Wide eyes are an expression of fear, surprise, and vulnerability. They are a [feminine](URL submissive trait, which is why Disney cartoonists draw big, [wide eyes](URL to convey innocence. Then there is the awkward, exaggerated, closed-mouth smile. A smile is a complex facial expression used to convey emotion. Most Alpha males sport either a self-satisfied smirk or avoid smiling altogether in pictures (more on that later). Ansari appears to be going for the former, but fails miserably. Now let's examine Brand. His brow is slightly furrowed, making his eyes appear to narrow. Using the Disney comparison again, [narrow eyes](URL are traditionally the sign of a villain. Guys on incel forums often talk about the ""[hunter eyes](URL because a predator narrows its gaze to better focus on a faraway target. Brand's facial expression is also neutral, conveying little emotion. # Alpha/Beta Expression Looking ""confident"" is really just the PC way of saying looking Alpha. So how do we look Alpha? Yes, I realize how cringe-inducing that sounds. Do you want to get laid on Tinder or not? There's a reason why I hire actual models and can't just use my handsome friends to display the products that I sell in my business. This shit takes talent and emotional intelligence. It isn't just about being extremely attractive, although that's certainly a large part of it. Models and actors are experts at generating the right vibe and feelings. Look at [Leonardo DiCaprio](URL who plays Alpha males in films and is also one in real life. Again, note the subtly furrowed brow and narrowed eyes. Notice the mouth, which is upturned so slightly as to be almost imperceptible. But the effect is dramatic - you can see the emotion conveyed through the smile lines in his face. It's a self-satisfied look, like he just nutted in some young model's mouth an hour before...which he probably did. Now let's look at a smile with teeth. Here is Britain's [Prince Philip](URL another noted Alpha, demonstrating both the smirk and the smile. Having an actual smile is okay, probably preferable in most instances. Not everyone can pull off the ""looking into the distance"" scowl, which usually ends up looking like a laughable ""fake Alpha"" pose. Whatever you do, a big, open-mouthed smile is a major faux pas. Avoid at all costs. **Head Position** Awhile back I got to talking with a guy at the gym who trained police officers in ""command presence."" Here's what he told me: *Dominant:* chin tilted up and your eyes appearing to look down at the target. *Submissive*: chin down, eyes looking upward. Never look up at the camera like you're about to give head to the viewer. That's a [female position](URL This [graphic](URL displays the three positions - sub, neutral, and dom. Don't exaggerate it. Aim for something between the second and third pics. **Alpha Expression** * Furrowed brow and narrowed eyes * Little emotion - neutral expression, smirk, or only top row of teeth showing. * Dominant/neutral head position **Beta Expression** Now let's look at [Ross](URL the Beta character from *Friends.* I have no idea if this actor is Beta in real life or just plays one, but it's a good example. While Ross is objectively a handsome man, you know from his body language - again, instantaneously - that he is a Beta male. He's smiling with only the top row of teeth, which is good. But there is zero expressiveness in the eyes. Note the raised brow, which gives him the Disney doe-eyed appearance. Ross looks like the type of attractive guy who would become some Alpha's prison wife. To summarize the Beta look: * Raised brow and wide eyes * Big or open-mouthed [Beta smile](URL conveying too much emotion. * Submissive pose # Execution Remember that this shit takes practice. Before I take my Tinder pictures, I practice my expression in the mirror and turn on music that gets me in the right mindset. You want to be relaxed. That's why a good photographer is friendly. Most people are awkward in front of the camera, which is why ""candid"" shots look better. I snap 30+ pictures, with the knowledge that most will be shit and 1 or 2 will be good, if I'm lucky. Search this sub for more in-depth guides on picture taking. Then I take a few pics that I think might work and get them rated on Photofeeler. It's difficult to judge yourself, so you need some honest ""hot or not"" feedback. Set rater age range up to 24 - we don't give a flying fuck about what older women think. # Conclusion Some guys will argue *none of this shit matters, just have 16 inch biceps and 10% body fat and you'll get endless matches.* And you know what? They're right. You can look Beta as hell and still get matches if you're an SMV 9. But profile vibe still makes a difference in how girls will respond to your advances. My Chad friend gets an assload of matches no matter what vibe he conveys. But even he reports that he gets more girls messaging him first and more sexualized conversations when he looks more ""Alpha."" Recently I did a post titled ""Why You Aren't Translating Your Tinder Matches/Dates Into Lays."" This post is the prequel to that guide. She goes into the conversation/date with an expectation of how you will behave based on her initial first impression. You're going to have a much harder time if your Beta profile is *incongruent* with your Alpha approach."
2,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Post-TRP LTR: a balancing act between masculine aggression and vulnerability,10,fuxcf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fuxcf4/posttrp_ltr_a_balancing_act_between_masculine/,2020-04-05 03:12:15,"**INTRO** I discovered TRP five or six years ago now. At that point in my life, I was smart, egotistic, socially awkward, and not particularly (read: not at all) attractive. I'm sure we all have our own treasured memories from high school. Over the years I succeeded and failed in applying TRP. A few years back, I met the girl who would become my first LTR ever. TRP gave me the ability to predict a lot of how she behaved, but I also used it to mask my insecurities. Instead of writing a novella with all the boring details, I jump from idea to idea doing my best to avoid TRP cliches. **BODY** First things first, my self awareness when she and I met might have put me on the autism spectrum (she used to point out similarities between myself and her friend with aspergers). My looks compensated for it; **weight lifting** contributed to my looks more than any other factor. I cannot overstate how important weight lifting has been in my life the past half a decade or so. Sex was always the most enjoyable when I treated it as a game. I learned to not go into the bedroom with a script in my head of how things were supposed to go; instead I went with the flow based on how she and I were feeling. Sometimes we fucked dirty, sometimes we made love, other times we just fucked around giggling like kids. Going with the flow always kept it natural; forcing it always felt rigid and unnatural. The only book I've read on the topic is The Sex God Method. I think it's a good starting point. An LTR will change you. You'll likely become gentler, softer, and more pleasure seeking. Being on the other side now, I can see how my LTR changed me in those ways. It's inevitable, and it's something you should be aware of before shacking up. This change has pros and cons: I lost some of my aggression and ambition, but gained empathy and a certain *joie de vivre* for life's sensual pleasures. Now that my relationship is over, I've regained my natural aggression and retained the softer skills I developed with my girl. **CONCLUSION** I'm grateful to have known the amazing girl I dated and for being TRP conscious going in. Before my relationship, I was decently attractive but very rough around the edges. IMO, LTRs are great for refining all aspects of seduction (wit, foreplay, etc.) and social agility. More than anything, I enjoyed really getting to know the other person in a way I know few others. All in all, I'm very satisfied with how things turned out and what I learned from the experience."
3,vulnerability,TheRedPill,No prescriptions. Be free. Unplug over and over and subscribe only to your experiences.,1,e3i9wf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/e3i9wf/no_prescriptions_be_free_unplug_over_and_over_and/,2019-11-30 05:05:29," Red Pill isn't a prescription. It's not a set of rules and ways to follow. It's not plugging into an ideology. Doing that, and following ideology, rules and ways other people told us to, was the problem in the first place. RedPill is simple truths. It is realising that we want certain things. It is realising that the 'way' we were told to get them, the rules to play by and beliefs to hold were a lie. A way of indoctrinating us into the system, to serve other purposes. Your results were never assured through this way. RedPill is not an 'answer' to all of this. It isn't another collection of 'if you want those things, THIS is the way to get them. Here, we will tell you how'. That is replacing one plug for another. That is giving up blindly following one ideology for another. The very same Mindset which allowed us to be controlled in the first place. If you've been pilled for a while and still searching for 'what to do' through the manosphere, your decisions are still being controlled by someone else's Taking the RedPill is simply accepting that 'this bullshit doesn't work. With that, we can empower ourselves to become free. To realise there are no 'rules'. Empower ourselves to reject the shit they tell us to be. We are then free to experiment, try and see things for ourselves. Other men's notes are simply their experiences, their suggestions, there experiments and what results they got. Always try for yourself, experience your own truths. Make YOUR rules, based on YOUR experiences. Find ways to get what you want. Don't just accept and follow another man's advice. Try it, choose what works and what doesn't. No rules, no system to follow, no ideaology. As long as you get what you want, WITHOUT following the blue way, then you are red. Red is not mindlessly following another system. It is rejecting all systems, as much as you can. It is empowering yourself to try, experiment, test and play with ideas until you discover your own system, which serves and satisfies you. RedPill men discover for themselves. Bluepill men follow others, with no personal experience that it works. Gullible. RedPill is a rejection of a system, not the blind acceptance of another one. There is no one 'way to live red pilled'. No archetype Red Pill man. There are simply a bunch of different experiences from different guys who tried different things, and reported their results. Try your ways, see for yourself. RedPill is a rejection of blue solutions. What that ultimately looks like and leads to, nobody can tell you. That's up to YOU to create. Don't scour the manosphere looking for 'the answers'. Looking for what 'You're told to do'. That's the same Mindset that had you following media, marketing, feminist agendas, school, parents etc. The manosphere will give you suggestions. What may have worked for someone else. Go out, test, play, experiment and be YOUR OWN POINT OF REFERENCE. Let your own experiences be your guide. Build your frame, rules and strategies based on what YOU, YOURSELF experience. RedPill is empowering you to be your own guide Most guys can't handle or even fathom the basic simplicity of being red. It's risk and vulnerability. It's no safety net of rules. They need a system to cling to. They need a hand to hold them. Someone else to reference. They need to minimise experimentation and failure and want answers handed to them. They want to live someone else's solutions, to have the results the other guy wanted. They trade one system they naively accepted for another. All the while asking 'is this red pill enough'? Is this enough part of your system? Do I have identity now? There is no system. No system designed to work, operate and fulfill your well-being. The system you adopt is your own. We don't want men all doing the same thing, for the same ends, the same reasons and same beliefs. We want men who found their own individual lives and solutions. Authentic, unique. The blue tried to turn us into sheep. If you don't understand that taking a red pill leads to a level of freedom, if you think it's supposed to mean you wake up tomorrow with the 'answers', you haven't truly sat in the space the pill can lead you to. What you have here, is a collection of experiences. A collection of different reports from men who tried things outside of a bluepill paradigm and reported their results. None of it is prescription. You're free to try for yourself, and free to accept or reject based on whether you get results you want. This was never a cookie cutting process. The power isn't in their eventual results, the power is in the space where they said 'I'm going to start trying some shit for myself. Some different tactics. What I was told not to do'. Try for yourself. Question everything. The true guys to follow are the ones who empower you to make your own decisions and own discoveries. 'I became a red pilled man'. WTF does that mean to you? Does it mean you read the sidebar, books and moulded yourself to it all to a t? There is no 'red pilled' man. No archetype, no character, no mould. If there was, and we all became the same, same behaviour, traits and choices, then we failed. If you need your hand held, and every answer before you even try. If you can't respond to a woman's text without consulting ASKtrp, can't choose whether to next a girl, can't approach without wanting to hear a fail safe msg...well...fuck off. You're prime meat to be swept up in another man's system. Harness the ability to stand in the space of red. The space of no rules, no ultimate truths, no prescriptions, no scripts. If someone tells you you're wrong, tell them to fuck themselves. Only YOU will know what works for you. As long as you're doing it being red pill aware and freedom to choose your way, you'll find your path. There could be more 'I' statements in this sub. I'm guilty of doing the 'you, you, you should' style. Really, you shouldn't do shit expect reject bluepill strategy as anything but death. I only have my experiences and what works for me. You will find what works for you. May that be similar? Sure. Some tactics are universally effective. May it be different? Hopefully. The blue tried to clone us. Harness the ability to be open-minded and willing to try. Take YOUR OWN feedback. Watch your own results. Fail, try another way, all the while not steadfastly believing anything until you've seen it for yourself. Just whatever you do, whatever you want, don't do it how blue pill tells you, and it's a good start."
4,vulnerability,TheRedPill,An approach on mental health - about external resources,1,dnsejh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/dnsejh/an_approach_on_mental_health_about_external/,2019-10-27 23:09:59,"After being told about this sub and reading posts here for a while now, I figured, that I have a topic to write about as well and it is also personally very important to me. Also I havent seen any real advice on this topic here yet. I basically only created an account to write this but didn't have enough karma for posting in the beginning or some other rules didn't apply, so understand, that what you're reading has been on the shelf for some time. **TL;DR:** Dont fool about with stress, do yourself a major favour: Sense, when you are struggling and take care of that problem before taking damage. I am a certified neurologist but my main field of work is more in psychiatry and psychodevelopmental research as well as teaching in these fields. I work in a high-achiever environment and most of the time not less than 60h per week. With my scientific work I am never not competing with other researchers who are after my fundings and my academic position. I am in my forties, yet unmarried and fathered three children (and before anyone says anything: all of them were planned). In the little free time that is left I am a father for my children, meet my affairs (or plates if you want), work out and the rest is consumed mostly with reading and eating and sleeping properly. I am telling all this to demonstrate the amount of stress I and people who work as hard can be under - even though I do not feel stressed and chose this lifestyle myself. At the same time I want to emphasise that nowhere near as much work is necessary to put someone under stress. Stress is a modern society phenomenon and is accountable for a whole palette of diseases, many of which are psychological, many of which can have severe impacts on our lives. I am glad for bulletproof individuals with indestructible coping mechanisms and rock hard determination but for everybody else I have to say that stress and its consequences should, frankly put, not ever be trifled with. As these syndromes almost exclusively develop not because of the stress itself but of the individual coping capability, our own experiences with stress are naturally very distinct from each other. Some people have no problems with murdering an 80h working week and still feel like theyve got excess energy and some might already have a hard time doing 40h a week. Now I know from my personal experience, from my patients and from reading this sub, that especially men often have a hard time dealing with stress because they have nobody they can sincerely and openly talk to. That is very understandable considering the fact that opening up to somebody makes us extremely vulnerable. Vulnerability is something that many of us cant afford: It makes us dependent on the grace of the women we sleep with and it gives our rivals valuable assets, which they can hold against us. So these men are stuck between a rock and a hard place: They cannot afford to make themselves vulnerable and at the same time still somehow have to deal with large amounts of stress and other stress-reaction-triggering events like personal trauma etc. Because these issues will not go away, they will not solve themselves. Having someone to talk to in my field of work is often referred to as an external resource when talking about individual coping mechanisms and strategies. It is also something that we always assess when somebody e.g. has a mental breakdown from stress or trauma aka. burnout aka. acute stress reaction. External resources are an important and valuable asset because they can dramatically enhance our capability to cope with all of lifes demands. Without external resources we are dependent solely on our own coping mechanisms, the loading capacity of which is highly variable among individuals. So this is my suggestion: choose an ally, a supporter who you can talk freely to. It is probably be due to my profession, that I highly recommend trained personell for this purpose. Apart from knowing all the proven-to-be-successful strategies and techniques they are *required by law* to keep your secrets. If youre feeling insecure or ashamed about having to attend a shrink (this is highly common in many cultures, which is understandable to an extent, as people dont like to think of themselves as sick in the head), maybe think of it as visiting a hooker but instead of handling your dick, they handle your mind. That perspective helped me, when I first had to visit a psychiatrist due to acute stress reaction in my early twenties. If that is still nothing for you or you cant afford professional aid, choose a friend or relative to be your confidant. Again from personal and very much from work experience I know that literally being able to just talk openly about something to somebody is an enormous help. This post is meant to help everybody whose coping resources are crumbling under the stress they have to deal with and those who feel insecure about admitting that they are struggling."
5,vulnerability,TheRedPill,WHAT IS ATTRACTIVE TO WOMEN? NOT WHAT YOU THINK.,0,cdmy2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/cdmy2p/what_is_attractive_to_women_not_what_you_think/,2019-07-16 06:25:54,"I cant think of a topic where more snake-oil gets peddled, so Id like to offer you a straight-forward way of understanding the fundamentals of what women find attractive. &amp;#x200B; Im writing from a mans perspective, but if youre a woman stick around. This will be useful when talking with your man about what you find sexually attractive. &amp;#x200B; Along the way, Im going to oversimplify, generalize, embrace gender stereotypes and heterosexual examples. If youre cool with that, lets go &amp;#x200B; HERES WHAT IS ATTRACTIVE TO WOMEN Sex therapist, Esther Perel, famously asks women this question in her live seminars: &amp;#x200B; Whats one thing that your man could do to make you more attracted and open to sex? &amp;#x200B; Can you guess what the most common answer is? &amp;#x200B; Help with the dishes! &amp;#x200B; If that makes no sense to you, I feel your pain so youre not alone. &amp;#x200B; I recently explained this phenomenon one of my newsletters. The next day, I received this upset message from a guy named Max: &amp;#x200B; Bruce, there are studies that show that the more men help with the housework, the less their wives are attracted to them!!! &amp;#x200B; Women are attracted to a masculine man, who is somewhat dominant and decisive in his mannerisms. Somewhat mysterious and uncommunicative. &amp;#x200B; If you are a male girlfriend to your partner, or too much of an understanding roommate you will get less sex from her. &amp;#x200B; Reading ideas like this leaves many of us (especially men) feeling confused and inadequate. &amp;#x200B; What if were not naturally dominant or mysterious or stoic? Are we supposed to fake it? &amp;#x200B; To understand what women find attractive in a man, we first need to first make some assumptions: &amp;#x200B; ASSUMPTION #1: YOURE IN A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH A MATURE WOMAN. A 40 year-old woman will be sexually attracted to different qualities than an 18 year-old girl will. &amp;#x200B; Also, the rules of the attraction game are vastly different depending on which relationship stage your relationship is in. &amp;#x200B; Here, were talking about how to stay sexually attractive in the eyes of your long-term partner. &amp;#x200B; ASSUMPTION #2: YOUR PARTNERS ATTACHMENT STYLE INFLUENCES WHAT THEY FIND SEXY. Heres the deal: You can be securely attached or insecurely attached &amp;#x200B; Securely attached means that you feel good about depending on your partner emotionally and having them depend on you. Insecurely attached means that you dont feel good about depending on your partner emotionally and having them depend on you. Theres a lot more to it than that, but for the sake of preventing information overload, well save it for another time. Whats important is that you know which you are. &amp;#x200B; If youre reading this, youre almost certainly insecurely attached. So is your partner. &amp;#x200B; Thats not a judgement or a curse, its just a statistical probability. Hey, Im insecurely attached too, so youre in good company!  &amp;#x200B; Depending on your attachment style, youll be attracted by very different things. &amp;#x200B; Whereas securely attached partners are drawn to have sex by the desire for intimacy, insecurely attached couples are commonly drawn to sex by the desire to reduce their anxiety or fear. &amp;#x200B; You may not immediately recognize your anxiety or fear, but thats OK. Stick with me &amp;#x200B; Attraction and Sex Drive decoded I have a high sex drive commonly turns out to be code for: I feel insecure about me or us and I need sex often so that I can soothe myself and feel better. &amp;#x200B; I have a low sex drive commonly turns out to be code for: I dont feel safe enough to be that vulnerable with you or I resent you and dont want to be that close with someone that I feel has hurt me and whom I cant trust wont hurt me again. &amp;#x200B; Notice how neither of those have anything to do with intimacy. &amp;#x200B; ASSUMPTION #3: SEXUAL ATTRACTION IS SPARKED BY TWO OPPOSING FORCES WITHIN EACH OF US. Just like an electrical circuit has both positive charge and negative charge, lets pretend that everyone has two opposing forces inside of them  ME and WE. &amp;#x200B; ME TRAITS Me, Myself, I Autonomous Analytical Protective Initiates Leads &amp;#x200B; WE TRAITS Family/Community Collaborative Nurturing Generous Responds Follows &amp;#x200B; ME traits are often considered masculine traits. WE traits are often considered feminine traits. I dont like to use these terms because its dangerously easy to confuse them with male and female. ME and WE is simpler. &amp;#x200B; What is attractive to women? ME and WE. We all have both ME and WE traits in differing amounts. &amp;#x200B; Alright. With those assumptions out of the way, lets do this &amp;#x200B; DO WOMEN REALLY FIND DOMINANT MEN ATTRACTIVE? RP common knowledge: Women are attracted to a masculine man, who is somewhat dominant and decisive in his mannerisms. Somewhat mysterious and uncommunicative. &amp;#x200B; Dominant Decisive Mysterious Uncommunicative... &amp;#x200B; Phew Thats a lot to live up to, but theres some truth to this. &amp;#x200B; Its true that many women find confidence and mystery attractive traits in a man. &amp;#x200B; Each of those is a ME trait. ME traits signal autonomy. And autonomy is sexy (for reasons well cover another time). &amp;#x200B; However, the idea that dominance is attractive is horribly oversimplified. &amp;#x200B; Many men (myself included) have mistakenly concluded that we need to be dominant, decisive, mysterious, and uncommunicative all the time, or risk losing our womans respect. Thats really hard to do. &amp;#x200B; Theres a name for people who are dominant all the time. Theyre called bullies. &amp;#x200B; Most women arent attracted to bullies. &amp;#x200B; Try being mysterious and uncommunicative (ME traits) when your partner is hurt and needs you to empathize and listen. Shell erect even higher walls around her heart to protect it from your insensitivity. &amp;#x200B; Then, the last thing shell feel like doing is making love with you. &amp;#x200B; The only person I can think of who meets the criteria for being dominant, decisive, mysterious, and uncommunicative all the time is James Bond. &amp;#x200B; The epitome of attractive - Daniel Craig Bond James Bond &amp;#x200B; Most women would agree that James Bond is a damn fine specimen of a sexy man. &amp;#x200B; Im pretty sure that there are millions of women who would be tickled pink at the thought of sharing some time between the sheets with such a confident, autonomous and mysterious man. &amp;#x200B; I mean, hes James Bond, right? Hes the poster boy for autonomy. &amp;#x200B; But, if I asked those same women if theyd want to spend the rest of their lives with James Bond? Im pretty certain that Id hear a resounding No thanks! &amp;#x200B; Why? &amp;#x200B; Because James Bond is a man who cant commit. Hes incapable of intimacy. He wont talk about his feelings. And hed never help out with the dishes. &amp;#x200B; Said another way, James Bond has massively under-developed WE traits. As a result &amp;#x200B; A man like James Bond is good for only two things  saving the world and a one night stand! &amp;#x200B; A man like James Bond is good for only 2 things  saving the world and a one night stand! &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; DO WOMEN REALLY FIND NICE GUYS UNATTRACTIVE? We men have been indoctrinated to believe that nice guys dont get the girl. &amp;#x200B; Not wanting to be jerks either, many of us feel stuck between a rock and a hard place, unsure of who to be and how to behave with our woman. &amp;#x200B; Our uncertainty isnt attractive and so she rejects our sexual advances. This perpetuates our belief that we need to be someone other than who we are to spark her sexual interest. &amp;#x200B; So, we resolve to be more like who we think she wants us to be. This in-authenticity isnt exactly attractive either and so she rejects our sexual advances again. &amp;#x200B; And round and round we go, stuck in a vicious cycle  each one a little bit worse than the last. &amp;#x200B; Until we resolve to banish our Nice Guy personality. &amp;#x200B; The Game - what pickup artists think women find attractive.Instead, having read in some dating book that women find this behavior attractive, we try to act like an Alpha Male. &amp;#x200B; Those same dating books tell men not to be too needy, available or emotional  basically, to not be human. Crazy, huh? &amp;#x200B; So, faking disinterest and emotional unavailability, we end up coming across as a Jerk instead. &amp;#x200B; Being a Jerk isnt attractive and so she rejects our sexual advances again. &amp;#x200B; Until we end up in a sexless marriage, having an affair or getting divorced. &amp;#x200B; All this because some relationship guru told us that women dont like Nice Guys. &amp;#x200B; Phew &amp;#x200B; So, lets set the record straight once and for all. &amp;#x200B; Most women arent attracted to wimps, but they arent attracted to jerks either. &amp;#x200B; Theres nothing wrong with being a nice guy, a decent guy, a considerate guy, a thoughtful guy or a caring guy. &amp;#x200B; In fact, if you cant express those traits, no self-respecting woman will want to be intimate with you. &amp;#x200B; So, lets not use the term Nice Guy. Its misleading. Ive got some new terms for us instead &amp;#x200B; THE NEW ARCHETYPES OF ATTRACTION The Integrated Man/Woman: &amp;#x200B; A person with developed ME traits and developed WE traits. They are autonomous and play well in a team. Theyre powerfully masculine and powerfully feminine and can choose to express more or less of either, depending on which is appropriate in the moment. &amp;#x200B; The Wimp (male  formerly known as the nice guy) or The Pushover (female): &amp;#x200B; A person with underdeveloped ME traits. They tend to not have a clear sense of direction in life and often come across as passive and needing to please. Theyre trying extra hard to not be too Masculine. &amp;#x200B; The Jerk (male) or The Hard Ass (female): &amp;#x200B; A person with underdeveloped WE traits. They tend to be self-centered, pushy and dominant, without much empathy for others. Theyre trying extra hard to not be too Feminine. &amp;#x200B; NOTE: These descriptions are the extremes of each archetype. You might recognize yourself (and your partner) somewhere in the middle. &amp;#x200B; What women find attractive is an integrated man. &amp;#x200B; We wimps, jerks, pushovers and hard-asses are NOT bad people. Were usually very loving, caring people. But we havent yet developed our ME and WE traits. &amp;#x200B; NEVER AGAIN MOMENTS Most of us have suffered a Never Again Moment  a moment where we experienced being badly hurt (or betrayed) by someone close to us and having little or no support to help us heal our hurt. &amp;#x200B; After a Never Again Moment: &amp;#x200B; Wimps and Pushovers often make a promise to themselves that they will never be like the person who dominated them. In doing so, they deny their dominance (a ME trait). Jerks and Hard Asses often decide that they will never again be dominated. In doing so, they deny their vulnerability (a WE trait). &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; ATTACHMENT STYLE INFLUENCES WHAT YOURE ATTRACTED TO To add to this sea of complexity, our attachment style also influences our partner choice. &amp;#x200B; Insecurely attached people tend to fall in love with other insecurely attached people. &amp;#x200B; So, when we meet a securely attached Integrated Man or Woman, well commonly break up with them pretty early on. But theyre likely to be the very person who can give us the partnership that we so want. &amp;#x200B; Why would we leave a person who can give us what we want? Because &amp;#x200B; the consistent emotional availability and stability that an Integrated Man/Woman provides, doesnt feel like Love to us. &amp;#x200B; It feels unfamiliar foreign. Were not expecting it or looking for it because we never received it as a child. &amp;#x200B; I LOVE YOU, BUT IM NOT IN LOVE WITH YOU The amount of emotional support we received as children can determine what we are attracted to as adults.Imagine, for example, that you grew up in a home where both of your parents worked all day. They werent available when you needed them to help you through difficult emotional times because they were working. &amp;#x200B; Youd grow up having little experience of what emotional support feels like. &amp;#x200B; You loved your parents (and they loved you too), but you grew up with a model of love that didnt include consistent emotional support during tough times. &amp;#x200B; Im emphasizing the word consistent because as children, what makes us feel safe is knowing that our parents will always be available, emotionally responsive and supportive when we are in distress. &amp;#x200B; Fast forward 20 years and you begin dating someone really secure. You fall in love. They want to support you, but youre weirded-out by their emotional availability. It feels icky to you. &amp;#x200B; Eventually, you end it saying, &amp;#x200B; I love you, but Im not in love with you. Can we still be friends? &amp;#x200B; That phrase is code for I care for you, but I feel no sexual attraction towards you. I want to find someone that makes my heart pound and feel alive. &amp;#x200B; If we were more self-aware, we might admit to this instead: &amp;#x200B; Your emotional support doesnt feel like love to me. I learned from my parents that love feels like the lack of emotional support. &amp;#x200B; So, Im breaking up with you so I can find someone less secure (and boring) than you are. &amp;#x200B; I dont feel comfortable being so stable. I want someone who isnt so emotionally available so I can feel my heart pounding and know that Im in love. &amp;#x200B; But what insecurely attached people never come to realize is &amp;#x200B; That heart-pounding in-love feeling isnt love  its FEAR! &amp;#x200B; LOVE AND FEAR FEEL SIMILAR If you pay attention when youre falling in love, youll notice that the feeling of being in love has many of the same characteristics as anxiety. &amp;#x200B; Your heart beats faster your palms get clammy you obsess over one thing (your mate) you cant concentrate or focus for too long youll do things youd never ordinarily do to get their attention When we find someone attractive, our heart pounds. This pounding is often fear, not love. &amp;#x200B; That heart-pounding 'in-love' feeling isn't love - it's FEAR! &amp;#x200B; Securely attached people report feeling love in a gentler way than insecurely attached people. Their hearts do beat faster, but its not that desperate kind of thump-thump-thump. Secure love is often a quieter, more grounded (some might even say boring) experience. &amp;#x200B; But secure love lasts. &amp;#x200B; Theres an overwhelming amount of evidence that suggests &amp;#x200B; Securely attached people are happier, are healthier and can live up to 10 years longer. &amp;#x200B; The good news is that anyone can learn to become securely attached and integrate their ME and WE traits. Thats what my work is all about. &amp;#x200B; WHAT WOMEN FIND ATTRACTIVE IN A MAN Over the years that Ive been helping couples, Ive heard thousands of men and women talk about the intimate details of their marriages and sex lives. Ive been able to collect a lot of data points. &amp;#x200B; In my experience, what most women consider sexy is a man who displays slightly more ME traits, and slightly less WE traits than she has. &amp;#x200B; That word, slightly, is important &amp;#x200B; Try being too wimpy or too dominant with an Integrated Woman and shell toss you to the curb. &amp;#x200B; When my clients talk about what their husband could do to be more attractive, they almost always say something like this: &amp;#x200B; I want him to take the lead, be protective if necessary But also be vulnerable, honest and supportive. &amp;#x200B; Are attractive integrated men unicorns?Isnt she describing a Unicorn? &amp;#x200B; Nope. Shes describing an Integrated Man. &amp;#x200B; These men are neither mysterious nor uncommunicative. &amp;#x200B; Theyre not overly dependent nor overly independent. &amp;#x200B; But theyre strong, kind, open, emotionally transparent and comfortable with being vulnerable (e.g. expressing sadness, fear, hurt). &amp;#x200B; They dont project their feelings onto their partner (e.g. Its because of you that I feel bad.). Theyre willing to be supportive and they expect their partner to be there and support them too. &amp;#x200B; You feel calm and safe being around them. &amp;#x200B; Which is why The Integrated Men seems like a Unicorn to most insecurely attached women. &amp;#x200B; Most of them are already taken, in stable marriages and have no plans to divorce. &amp;#x200B; If youre a man and youre feeling a little overwhelmed thinking How do I ever live up to that?, thats OK. We all have to begin somewhere on our journey towards integration and maturity. Whats important is that you begin. &amp;#x200B; But where to begin? &amp;#x200B; WHAT SECURELY ATTACHED LOOKS LIKE Because most of us (insecurely attached folks) didnt exactly have great role models when it came to love, weve never been shown what a securely attached relationship looks like and feels like. &amp;#x200B; So, Id like to give you a sense of what a securely attached relationship feels like by offering you this metaphor. &amp;#x200B; Partner dancing together sparks attraction &amp;#x200B; When a couple with integrated ME and WE traits come together, it can look a lot like partner dancing. In partner dancing, one partner leads, and one partner follows. &amp;#x200B; This video will help you understand better than my words ever can. &amp;#x200B; Beautiful, right? And its damn sexy. &amp;#x200B; The man is leading (a ME trait), but not dominating. The woman is following (a WE trait), but not like a pushover. She follows powerfully. &amp;#x200B; Thats what a mature, securely attached relationship feels like in the bedroom and out in the world. &amp;#x200B; However, for insecurely attached couples, the dance of attraction doesnt always look as graceful. It looks like a lot more pushing and pulling and standing on each others toes. &amp;#x200B; And thats OK because partner dancing can be learned. Some of us learned as children by watching our parents, but for the rest of us, we have to find a teacher. &amp;#x200B; If youre interested in learning how to partner gracefully together, I teach that here. &amp;#x200B; THE FINAL WORD ON ATTRACTION AND HOUSEWORK Max wrote: and over time, the more men help with the housework, the less their wives are turned on!!! &amp;#x200B; Do women find washing the dishes attractive?I havent read the research Max quoted, but I suspect that the findings are a little more nuanced. &amp;#x200B; Could being a Good Guy really strip you of your desirability in your mates eyes and make you unattractive to women? &amp;#x200B; Obviously not. &amp;#x200B; Helping out with the dishes demonstrates partnership, collaboration and caring (all WE traits). &amp;#x200B; The lack of ME traits is what is not attractive to women, not the presence of WE traits. &amp;#x200B; And, theres no way any researcher could ever correlate washing the dishes with a spouses waning sexual desire. &amp;#x200B; Firstly, these couples were not in a controlled environment. Secondly, there are a million other variables (like age, culture, health, menopause, hormone levels, etc) that could be influencing her sexual desire. Perhaps its a chemical in the dishwashing soap that zaps sexual desire in women. &amp;#x200B; Did they test that? I doubt it. &amp;#x200B; The best that researchers can do is thumb-suck their conclusions. &amp;#x200B; While writing this, I got side-tracked and designed a dish-washing liquid label. I think its funny.  &amp;#x200B; Can washing the dishes make your wife more attracted to you? &amp;#x200B; WHAT TURNS ALL WOMEN OFF In her fantastic book, Hold Me Tight, Dr. Sue Johnson shares research that shows that when men and women were presented with sexually explicit images while being hooked up to brain scanning equipment, both sexes were equally aroused. &amp;#x200B; Pre-frontal Cortex stops sexual desire &amp;#x200B; However, the womens brains lit up in an area that did not light up in the mens brains  the Prefrontal Cortex. This area of the brain is concerned with control and judgment. &amp;#x200B; The researchers concluded that in response to a sexual cue, ALL women are preoccupied with safety at the same time. &amp;#x200B; Not so in men. &amp;#x200B; So, to all you men reading this, if your woman doesnt feel safe around you, youre not getting any nookie tonight. &amp;#x200B; Washing the dishes is attractive to women because its a demonstration that youre a safe man. It shows her that youre on her side. That you care. That she is not alone in your relationship or marriage. &amp;#x200B; It may also help to silence her Prefrontal Cortex in response to your sexual invitation. It takes her foot off her sexual brakes, allowing her arousal to naturally blossom. &amp;#x200B; So, keep washing those dishes! &amp;#x200B; HOW TO STAY ATTRACTIVE TO YOUR WOMAN Me and We TraitsIf you want to keep building attraction between you over the course of your long-term relationship or marriage, you both need to develop your ME and WE traits. &amp;#x200B; Heres how &amp;#x200B; STRENGTHENING ME TRAITS To develop your ME traits, you have to become acquainted with your inner terrain, and this is a solo journey. &amp;#x200B; A powerful (and free) tool for developing ME traits is meditation. &amp;#x200B; Youll see results in weeks, not years. I recommend getting started with some apps on your phone. Ive tried Calm, 10% Happier, and Headspace. Theyre all good. &amp;#x200B; STRENGTHENING WE TRAITS To develop your WE traits, you have to increase your emotional intelligence. For that, you need other people. &amp;#x200B; I recommend that you get involved in some kind of team sport. &amp;#x200B; Better still, join a mens group (I loved The Mankind Project) or womans group (e.g. Woman Within). &amp;#x200B; Alternatively, any intimate group coaching environment where youre forced to be vulnerable will open you up and develop your WE traits. You cant go wrong with any Landmark Worldwide program. Start with the Landmark Forum. It might be the best $500 you ever spend on yourself. &amp;#x200B; Acro yoga can increase attraction in a couple My wife and I learning Acro Yoga together. &amp;#x200B; BUILDING STRONG ME AND WE TRAITS AS A COUPLE The fastest way I know of to develop your ME and WE traits is to learn to partner dance together. &amp;#x200B; Yes, I am suggesting that you go to dancing classes together. As a man, youll learn to lead gracefully. As a woman, youll learn to follow powerfully. &amp;#x200B; I think youll thank me afterward. &amp;#x200B; Another great partner activity is Acro Yoga. Again, it teaches the man to lead safely and the woman to follow trustingly. &amp;#x200B; IN CONCLUSION In conclusion, what your woman finds attractive is a topic with many facets. &amp;#x200B; I hope that reading this has helped lift some of the fog of confusion that surrounds it. &amp;#x200B; In the end, only she is the expert on what turns her on and what turns her off. To find out, youre going to have to risk asking her. &amp;#x200B; Here are two questions that I recommend everybody ask their partner: &amp;#x200B; When youre most attracted to me, what am I doing? When youre most turned-off by me, what am I doing? When she answers, listen carefully and then thank her for her honesty. Whatever you do, dont defend yourself or try to explain yourself. Just listen and learn. &amp;#x200B; Then, keep doing the things that she finds attractive and stop doing the things that turn her off. Its not rocket science, I promise! &amp;#x200B; Heres whats important to remember: &amp;#x200B; We all have both ME and WE energies. When it comes to what women find sexually attractive, most woman want their man to display more ME energy that she does. Its not the presence of WE energy that turns a woman off, its the absence of ME energy. Above all, your job as a man is to make your woman feel safe enough to open up to the possibility of sex. Sign up for some dance lessons. That heart-pounding, in-love feeling is probably fear. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; [URL"
6,vulnerability,TheRedPill,12 Rules for Life  An In-Depth Mini-Series (Part 2),8,cm63i4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/cm63i4/12_rules_for_life_an_indepth_miniseries_part_2/,2019-08-05 14:04:12,"Greetings gentlemen &amp; welcome to the second part of the series! After noticing some of the backlash from my previous submission, there are a few disclaimers Id like to put out here before I continue: *(a) I will be referring the writer of the book simply as the author;* *(b) The author, regardless of his establishment authority, his sex life, his tradcon persona and whatnot, I invite you simply to look at him as another figure with insightful information. Everything we label him with, good or bad, do not compromise the content of his book;* *(c) The corresponding flair is Building Power. Due to the authors practical inexperience with intersexual dynamics, I will try and avoid that topic, but for the sake of relevance, I will tie some of that into my summaries if deemed necessary. The main subject however remains on building power.* Furthermore, no one is encouraging you to take everything the author says at face value (literally). Rule #1s Stand up straight, with your shoulders back will not solve your issues, but there is a meaningful message behind the formulation of such a rule. Read between the lines. Finally, well never know the authors true intentions. We cant read his mind. Shifting the blame of the younger generation from established institutions to themselves is the negative formulation of making young generations more self-responsible just as RP is misogynistic is for RP views masculine sexual strategy as amoral. To keep a meaningful discussion in the comment section, I invite you thus not to criticize the author of the book but much more on the content of the book. Happy reading! # Rule #2: Treat Yourself Like Someone You Are Responsible for Helping Steven has recently received an organ transplant. `As unspectacular as that may seem, only a very small portion of deceased people donate their organs, and an even smaller size of those remnants may be compatible for any recipient. After a match, the patient has to go through dialysis; its a disgusting process that takes a lot of time, patience, and perhaps, money. Point is, if successful, the process is nothing short from spectacular.` As known by many, side effects of transplants, very often, is the immunity systems rejection of the organ. To minimize such effects, patients have to take anti-rejection drugs. The sad part is that, despite the whole process, Stevens treatment is unsuccessful. He doesnt take his goddamn pills. All this commitment, those resources, just to have it fail at the easiest part? Who the fuck would want to screw this up? How can someone be dumb enough to do this to themselves? The even sadder part is, Stevens dog is sick. He takes him to the vet, who prescribes him medication. Every day thereafter, Steven ensures that his dog gets extra taken care of. But the thing is, why? Why would Steven be more inclined to administer prescription medication to his dog than to himself? Does he care more about the dog than himself? Is he that worthless? Is all hope lost? `The author, in an attempt to answer this question, takes a huge detour. Within the concepts explaining this behavior, he talks a bit about moral obligations. For obvious reasons, I will skip that part, but will try nonetheless to make the answer as clear as possible.` **Objectivity vs. Subjectivity** Ill save you some textbook examples between objectivity and subjectivity because you probably know those already. One way to differentiate them is by looking at how the objective/subjective statements are transmitted (aka scientific papers vs. stories and movies). The former is understood as a place of things, while the latter, as a place of action. We need both. The emotional weight of a death can rarely be conveyed through the description of a scientific paper, but the same emotional weight cannot be magnified to a global scale and interpreted in the same manner by most people. We are in the extremely fortunate era of being able to complement the understanding of our environment to the benefit our own actions (basically what TRP serves for). It boils down to the following: *if you are on The Red Pill, you have probably once overinvested your beliefs into the acceptance of societys emotional narrative, at the cost of your own well-being.* Youre now trying to compensate by attempting to understand your environment better. **Order, Chaos, and the 3rd Element** This section gets very symbolic, but I dont believe that any other better concepts can be used to explain this next section. Recall the Yin-Yang Circle, where the white is represented as order, and the black, as chaos. Order is *explored territory*, and by contract, chaos is *unexplored territory*. Basically, order is the security of your job; chaos is being inadvertently fired without warning. In CH1, it was established that nothing is so certain that it cannot change. This is why you find the black dot within the white region, and the white dot within the black region of the circle. Given any circumstance, *shit happens*. You are constantly threading on thin ice that may break under your feet at any given moment. But you already knew all of this. Everyone understands order and chaos, even when we dont know we know it. As kids, we understand the strange, surreal stories of Pinocchio, Sleeping Beauty, the Lion King, and Beauty and the Beast, with their eternal landscapes of known and unknown, world and underworld. We understand because we have gone through countless good and bad times. Time and time again, we can always relate to such stories (insofar as long as we were plugged in). In fact, even animals know all of this. Birds will fly away in fear when hearing your steps approaching (chaos) but will happily stay in its tribe and steal some food from its neighboring birds when appropriate (order). Now, I introduce you to the 3rd Element. It is the gamechanger. It is what separates us from the other animals. We owe our position at the top of the food chain to this trait that makes us reign supreme. The 3rd Element is *consciousness.* Everything begins to fall into place when you start to consciously understand the world. Its as if the knowledge of your body falls into alignment with the knowledge of your intellect. Its knowing why despite the statement of my ex-boyfriend is a douchebag, she still continually goes back to him. Now, having resumed the concepts of objectivity, subjectivity, order, chaos and consciousness in mind, I am presenting a word-by-word passage from the book. It is an absolute bombshell that I believe had to be preserved in its original form to deliver the full effect of the content. Here it is: `If you decide to skip this section, I encourage you to at least read the last paragraph. It is the most relevant.` *We are adapted, in the deepest Darwinian sense, not to the world of objects, but to the meta-realities of order and chaos, yang and yin. Chaos and order make up the eternal, transcendent environment of the living.* *To straddle that fundamental duality is to be balanced: to have one foot firmly planted in order and security, and the other in chaos, possibility, growth, and adventure. When life suddenly reveals as intense, gripping and meaningful; when time passes, and youre so engrossed in what youre doing you dont notice  it is there and then that you are located precisely on the border between order and chaos.* *The subjective meaning that we encounter there is the reaction of our deepest being, our neurologically, and evolutionarily grounded instinctive self, indicating that we are ensuring the stability but also the expansion of habitable, productive territory, of space that is personal, social, and natural. \[\]* *Order is not enough. You cant just be stable, and secure, and unchanging, because there are still vital and important new things to be learned. Nonetheless, chaos can be too much. You cant long tolerate being swamped and overwhelmed beyond your capacity to cope while you are learning what you still need to know. Thus, you need to place one foot in what you have mastered and understood, and the other in what you are currently exploring and mastering. Then you have positioned yourself where the terror of existence is under control and you are secure, but where you are also alert and engaged. That is where there is something new to master and some way that you can be improved. That is where meaning is to be found.* **Classifying into Leagues  The Garden of Eden** In this next section, using the Old Testament, the author talks a bit about self-consciousness through Adam &amp; Eves interactions with the forbidden fruit. For obvious reasons, Ill skip most of it. Long story short, upon biting into the fruit of consciousness, their first reaction was to conceal their naked bodies. Now, on a literal level, this means nothing. Metaphorically, however, this action was to conceal their own exposure. To hide their own vulnerability. This becomes relatable on so many levels. Beauty shames the ugly. Strength shames the weak. Ideals shame us all. Thus, we come to fear it. We can probably all relate to those statements. Such is the power created by classification  the HB5 vs. the HB9. In the Rationale Male, Rollo stated that by seeing another woman out of his league, the man merely disqualified himself in her eyes. The insecurity created from his own mindset has eradicated any potential opportunities. In the same way, the unconfident will hide themselves. Adam and Eves story with regards to God is no different; in their eyes, they could never reach Gods level, hence their concealment. **Steven** Now, back to Stevens story with his dialysis and his dog. The question was: Why doesnt he take care of himself? The author proceeds with the following: He knows much more about himself than anyone else. Only he knows the full range of his secret transgressions, insufficiencies, and inadequacies. Thus, no one has more reason to hold him in contempt, to see him as pathetic as himself. By withholding something that might do him good, he can punish himself for all his failings. His dog, harmless, unselfish, and innocent is clearly more deserving. *Not convinced? There is another way to formulate it.* If we wish to take care of ourselves properly, we would absolutely have to respect ourselves first. Deep down, many dont, because they consider themselves already hopeless. **Consider the archetypal male example**: Not so confident, self-sacrificing, and stubbornly stuck to their own values. Try to poke a hole in their fallacies and they will furiously bite back. But when left alone, they just pass time by doing nothing. Nothing productive in the least. There isnt even **the concept of order** in their lives; they only look desperately to achieve happy moments: video games, masturbation, drugs. Everything else is subsequently labeled as chaos to them. The narrative society led them to believe and follow hasnt worked for them. They absolutely believe, deep down, that they are hopeless. Thus, they arent ready to help themselves. Self-respect is utterly absent. And such effects can be devastating. The author expands on that in future chapters. Now picture the archetypal Chad. Would he take the pills? Would he take care of himself, as someone he is responsible for helping? Thought so too. No need to expand. **The Main Takeaway** In the author clinical practices, he often encouraged people to credit themselves and those around them for acting productively and with care towards others. Maybe Steven cant take care of himself, but at the very least, he takes care of his dog. And that simple fact may be enough to increase the goodness within his awareness. There is an unspoken level of beauty in what normal, everyday people accomplish  to say nothing of the staggering achievements of the truly remarkable. And as a consequence of that, we do deserve some respect. You may be important to other people, **but more so to yourself**. To treat yourself as if you were someone responsible for helping isnt to treat yourself to what you want, nor to seek for what makes you happy. Instead, it is to consider what would be truly good for you. And that, is self-love. So, if you need to hit the gym, do it. Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping."
7,vulnerability,TheRedPill,What Exactly is Charisma? Explaining this Magnetic Power(long read),2,boke4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/boke4j/what_exactly_is_charisma_explaining_this_magnetic/,2019-05-15 01:29:41,"Thousands of years ago, people believed in gods and spirits, but few could ever say that they had witnessed a miracle, a physical demonstration of divine power. A man, however, who seemed possessed by a divine spiritspeaking in tongues, ecstatic raptures, the expression of intense visionswould stand out as one whom the gods had singled out. And this man, a priest or a prophet, gained great power over others. What made the Hebrews believe in Moses, follow him out of Egypt, and remain loyal to him despite their endless wandering in the desert? The look in his eye, his inspired and inspiring words, the face that literally glowed when he came down from Mount Sinaiall these things gave him the appearance of having direct communication with God, and were the source of his authority. And these were what was meant by ""charisma,"" a Greek word referring to prophets and to Christ himself. In early Christianity, charisma was a gift or talent vouchsafed by God's grace and revealing His presence. Most of the great religions were founded by a Charismatic, a person who physically displayed the signs of God's favor. &amp;#x200B; Over the years, the world became more rational. Eventually people came to hold power not by divine right but because they won votes, or proved their competence. The great early-twentieth-century German sociologist Max Weber, however, noticed that despite our supposed progress, there were more Charismatics than ever. What characterized a modern Charismatic, according to Weber, was the appearance of an extraordinary quality in their character, the equivalent of a sign of God's favor. How else to explain the power of a Robespierre or a Lenin? More than anything it was the force of their magnetic personalities that made these men stand out and was the source of their power. They did not speak of God but of a great cause, visions of a future society. Their appeal was emotional; they seemed possessed. And their audiences reacted as euphorically as earlier audiences had to a prophet. When Lenin died, in 1924, a cult formed around his memory, transforming the communist leader into a deity. **Today, anyone who has presence, who attracts attention when he or she enters a room, is said to possess charisma.** But even these less-exalted types reveal a trace of the quality suggested by the word's original meaning. Their charisma is mysterious and inexplicable, never obvious. They have an unusual confidence. They have a giftoften a smoothness with language that makes them stand out from the crowd. They express a vision. We may not realize it, but in their presence we have a kind of religious experience: we believe in these people, without having any rational evidence for doing so. When trying to concoct an effect of charisma, never forget the religious source of its power. You must radiate an inward quality that has a saintly or spiritual edge to it. Your eyes must glow with the fire of a prophet. Your charisma must seem natural, as if it came from something mysteriously beyond your control, a gift of the gods. In our rational, disenchanted world, people crave a religious experience, particularly on a group level. Any sign of charisma plays to this desire to believe in something. And there is nothing more seductive than giving people something to believe in and follow. *The following are basic qualities that will help create the illusion of charisma:* &amp;#x200B; **Purpose**. If people believe you have a plan, that you know where you are going, they will follow you instinctively. **Mystery**. Mystery lies at charisma's heart, but it is a particular kind of mysterya mystery expressed by contradiction. Since most people are predictable, the effect of these contradictions is devastatingly charismatic. They make you hard to fathom, add richness to your character, make people talk about you. **Saintliness**. Most of us must compromise constantly to survive; saints do not. They must live out their ideals without caring about the consequences. The saintly effect bestows charisma. **Eloquence**. A Charismatic relies on the power of words. The reason is simple: words are the quickest way to create emotional disturbance. They can uplift, elevate, stir anger, without referring to anything real. **Theatricality**. A Charismatic is larger than life, has extra presence. Actors have studied this kind of presence for centuries; they know how to stand on a crowded stage and command attention. Surprisingly, it is not the actor who screams the loudest or gestures the most wildly who works this magic best, but the actor who stays calm, radiating self-assurance. The effect is ruined by trying too hard. It is essential to be self-aware, to have the ability to see yourself as others see you. **Uninhibitedness**. Most people are repressed, and have little access to their unconsciousa problem that creates opportunities for the Charismatic, who can become a kind of screen on which others project their secret fantasies and longings. You will first have to show that you are less inhibited than your audiencethat you radiate a dangerous sexuality, have no fear of death, are delightfully spontaneous. Even a hint of these qualities will make people think you more powerful than you are. **Fervency**. You need to believe in something, and to believe in it strongly enough for it to animate all your gestures and make your eyes light up. This cannot be faked. Politicians inevitably lie to the public; what distinguishes Charismatics is that they believe their own lies, which makes them that much more believable. **Vulnerability**. Charismatics display a need for love and affection. They are open to their audience, and in fact feed off its energy; the audience in turn is electrified by the Charismatic, the current increasing as it passes back and forth. This vulnerable side to charisma softens the self-confident side, which can seem fanatical and frightening. **Adventurousness**. Charismatics are unconventional. They have an air of adventure and risk that attracts the bored. Be brazen and courageous in your actionsbe seen taking risks for the good of others. **Magnetism**. If any physical attribute is crucial in attraction, it is the eyes. They reveal excitement, tension, detachment, without a word being spoken. Indirect communication is critical in seduction, and also in charisma. The demeanor of Charismatics may be poised and calm, but their eyes are magnetic; they have a piercing gaze that disturbs their targets' emotions, exerting force without words or action. &amp;#x200B; *Genuine charisma thus means the ability to internally generate and externally express extreme excitement, an ability which makes one the object of intense attention and unreflective imitation by others.

8,vulnerability,TheRedPill,This is why nice guys never get what they want. They always do the same thing over and over hoping to get something different.,0,9fxdjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/9fxdjh/this_is_why_nice_guys_never_get_what_they_want/,2018-09-15 10:42:04,"When it comes to NEVER and ALWAYS, black and white thinking is the proponent for staying stuck which goes round and round until you change your mind. I have noticed when it comes to interacting with people the best course of action is to watch yourself. Watch yourself go to work, watch yourself interact with the people you work with and those whom you spend time with at home. The reason why this is important is because you can begin to acknowledge the patterns, those behaviors that are causing you to repress your feelings and behave ineffectively. So you can get what you want without being a victim of the war in the Middle East, global warming, your deceased relatives who are growing older, its all the same. In order for nice guys to start getting what they want they need to start asking. You need to ask a girl to go on a date with you and stop expecting her to call you for a blowjob after a stressful day. But if it happens my god dont over analyze and track her every move. Just let it be. Most girls dont want you to scratch their back when they do something for you. This is what we would call nice girls and every beta who has yet to grow up will treat her like Mommy 2.0 and let me tell you having sex with women doesnt initiate you to manhood. It does not take the vulnerability out of your interactions suddenly because you gave her the dick. Although her female biology will start to naturally submit to you in more natural ways that are subconscious. None of which you need to worry about. Just be aware of the way you interact with people. The cause and effect relationship between what youre giving so that youre not giving to get. Youre not telling her I love you so she can tell you back. Dont do all the silly things guys do. Be normal. Just do it with another purpose. "
9,vulnerability,TheRedPill,My Unicorn and How I Created Her,1,9hxuak,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/9hxuak/my_unicorn_and_how_i_created_her/,2018-09-22 17:11:46,"Hi, everyone. I've been a lurker for a little under a year and have thoroughly enjoyed the red pill journey. I've read the entire sidebar (and a ton of Rollo's blog) and can say that despite having known a few of these things intrinsically, most of the information was revelatory to my cognizant being and it has changed my life. (I have so much of my story I could tell and will in time.) In addition to that, with my new frame of mind I've definitely not only started to have more success with women, but virtually \*every\* experience with women in my past makes exponentially more sense... and while I could write multiple posts about every one of those experiences, I'd like to focus on the main woman I am currently dating, do some theorizing, and ask for some feedback. The woman I'm dating is most definitely a Unicorn as of the writing of this post. Like, 100%, no doubt. We've been together almost 4 years now. As I've been reading red-pill over the last year, I actually believe I have \*the\* most Unicorn-ey Unicorn I've ever heard of... and I will get into how I think this happened and my influence over it. I will add right away that when you take our romantic relationship away, she is also my best friend. The combination of being lovers and best friends is probably one of the main reasons this has worked, and continues to work. I am extremely lucky. If you believe in the spiritual and metaphysical, then I'll add that our relationship exists on a transcendental level as well. She literally \*is\* the person I can tell anything to (like you would to a best friend) and actually \*does\* accept my vulnerability when it comes out in its full force. She, like me, has playful fantasies of joining the Illumanati and committing to the most transparently real life this existence has to offer. I don't know where she came from and is definitely as unique of a \*human\* as she is a woman. And yeah... I fuck her good. Despite all of this, I recognize in retrospect (we've been dating almost 4 years now), that my dread game for the last 4 years has been impeccable with her, despite it being played out in a very unconventional way. In addition to that, I never, ever developed Oneitis for her. We started out in a polyamarous relationship and I told her from the very beginning that I would never be able to fall for her fully because that wasn't who I was and I was already in love with another woman. (Which at the time was true. I was not red-pilled until recently.) Essentially, I never gave all my heart to her. She currently has 25-33% of it, and that's all she will ever get. I intend to settle down with 3-4 lovers, and her being bisexual means an eventual perma-triangle for us as well. So yeah... I was able to enjoy her and her company, even very passionately, while constantly reminding her that I wasn't hers to give my self to. For whatever reason, this paradox worked out perfectly for us. There were days I'd feel incredibly passionate toward her and then other days I told her I was thinking about other women and wasn't feeling the two of us. This intense switch-flipping made her think about me intensely and created a bond between us that is now very strong. Again, I think the lack of Oneitis on my part played an integral role in her falling for me, and me growing very fond of her. She allows me to be me, but I'm also the best thing that's ever happened to her. I can't say the same isn't true for me, but a lot of that has to do with the fact I lucked out and got a best friend and a lover out of the same person. From the very beginning of my journey with her, I told her that I'm nothing but transparent and if she wanted to hang with me, she'd have to be strong enough to handle my honest thoughts and desires, because most woman couldn't. That did the trick, lemme tell ya. The approach may not have been the best for getting sex, but after knocking down more than a dozen women, (fucking half of them only once before scaring them away), I finally found one that found me high enough value that I actually manipulated her ego into becoming completely red-pilled... and that's what I wanted. More than sex. So I've teased a \*lot\* of women (some I've fucked, some I didn't), regarding their self-awareness. I put their ego in check. \[b\]I essentially told them the only \*real\* way they could please me was to become more self-aware.\[/b\] In doing this to my lover of 4 years, she red-pilled herself along with me as it happened to me last year. (I told her I was her guide, not her master.) NOW, she can't go back, just like I can't go back... and our relationship is fucking fantastic. I can literally share with her \*any\* aspect of not only red-pill, but my life, my thoughts and my desires. She doesn't run from it. She knows that if she doesn't want to play, she's free to walk away, but my lack of Oneitis has kept her enamored for years, and I suspect we will be life partners as I continue to explore other women. Only time will really tell. That uncertainty and lack of commitment helps too, obviously. So, to make a quick checklist. HOW did this happen? How did she become a Unicorn to me? \-First a foremost, she wanted it for herself. (To grow.) That's a pre-requisite of a woman that \*has\* to be present before you can mold her. The vast majority of women think they are willing, but then when put to the test, change their mind quickly. I think her father, who is awesome, played in integral role in her mind being open. \-She is only about an HB6 or HB7, so she got enough attention to have some fun years and develop a healthy sexuality, but not enough to become an entitled bitch. \-She was in a NINE YEAR relationship before me between the ages of 20 and 29. They had sex with other people together, but she pairbonded with him hard. This worked in my favor extremely well when I came next. (I met her when she was 29. We are both 33 now.) \-I never developed Oneitis for her. \-Dread game is present... she even knows what dread game is and logically gets it. She gets that value is created in partnerships and not intrinsic... that it has to be maintained. \-I was outcome indifferent regarding how she decided to respond to my life's mission. \-We are best friends in addition to lovers. That happened as organically as our romance. Our interests are incredibly similar. Again, I got fucking lucky. If our romance ended, our friendship would not. It's \*that\* strong. We sat with all of our pain when things got hard. She was willing. \-She is bisexual, and I reminded her that red-pill ideas for her own sexual conquests toward woman would be useful. (THIS FACT HAS HELPED A LOT.) \-I maintained a sense of high-value from the very beginning by letting her know I was interested in other women and had huge life long pursuits that had nothing to do with her, but she could tag along if they interested her. (They did.) \-I would frequently withdraw attention and focus on other women and projects... then during the time I \*was\* with her, I would show her large amounts of love and affection. This paradox confused the hell out of her until she realized that's who I was. (In the beginning, it confused the hell out of ME as well, but red pill helped me make sense of me a lot better.) \-I used her own ego and desire to please a man against her by telling her that only self-aware woman and women that could accept a man's occasional vulnerability could truly please me. This worked fucking fantastically. I cannot over emphasize how valuable this technique it, but you have to REALLY be alpha in her eyes and build up a lot of what I call ""credit"" in the relationship to be able to drop frame from time to time. (Only do this with LTR's.) This should be a post all by itself. Red-pilled men underestimate the power of waking a woman up if they assert that only self-aware woman can truly please them long-term. (Think cult-leaders. I'm an ex-Mormon, so I know.) Ultimately, it may actually be our job as men to wake women up, we just have to be outcome indifferent and be willing to dump a bitch if she says she wants one thing and does another. \-I held frame and pointed out her inconsistencies step-by-step like a healthy and loving guide would. This made her trust me. To this day, I've never lied to her and I've never disrespected her boundaries. \*\*\*it takes that level of commitment to your own discipline and practice to train a woman the way I have\*\*\* My practices have been brutal honesty and transparency for years... recently it's building a stronger frame. (Thanks, Red Pill.) What I have now is a woman who not only accepts that I'm going to have sex with other women as I enter my prime and she leaves hers, but also one who can take any red-pill truth and is committed to living a transparent life. She gets that she had her fun in her early 20's and I have not yet had mine. (I was teenage Tupac level Nice Guy) She gets that as long as I get my sexual needs met, I'm never going to leave her. She gets red pill, essentially... and the way I was able to do it was by being alpha enough to make her feel like the only types of women that would truly please me were ones self-aware enough to understand themselves. Fuckin' crazy, right? It all sounds paradoxical until you remember that women want to please their alpha. If the alpha says what pleases him is self-aware women, women will become such for their men if their men are powerful enough to tend to their woman's mind. If this had not happened to me first-hand with my Unicorn lover, I don't know if I would have believed it possible to happen at all. As it stands, I share with her red-pill ideas daily and I don't give a fuck if she gets sick of it, cuz the door has always been there for her to walk through. She hasn't yet got sick of it and is starting to really love it. She actually is starting to really enjoy being self-aware of her submissive side. I've laid out the ways I think I was able to make this happen and the fortunate events in her life that worked in my favor. I've experienced the truth first-hand that Unicorns are not born, but that they \*can\* be created if all the pieces fall \*just right.\* Regardless of all of this, I sympathize with the unavoidable truth that at the moment, there aren't enough women willing enough to be molded to go around to all my red-pilled brothers and that I am indeed lucky as fuck. Regardless, I think that if we have any hope of salvaging the future, teasing and leading women into becoming as self-aware as possible is not a bad thing for the relationship. Women want to please their alpha, and you have more power to guide them into waking up to their own nature than you realize... but you have to do it carefully. "
10,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Brett Kavanaugh's Tears: Women Can't Understand Male Emotion,610,9k3h46,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/9k3h46/brett_kavanaughs_tears_women_cant_understand_male/,2018-09-30 14:30:48,"There is plenty to discuss about the Kavanaugh fiasco, but one aspect that has struck me as particularly cruel is the backlash against his emotional display. The mainstream press has dignified this grotesque evisceration by publishing the criticism, much of it written by women. I won't link to any examples, but anyone can find them pretty easily. In short, the disgust over Kavanaugh's tears provides a prime example of a simple truth: **women are not only incapable of understanding male vulnerability, but instinctively react with loathing when they do encounter it.** &gt;Heres the painful pattern that emerged from my research with men: We ask them to be vulnerable, we beg them to let us in, and we plead with them to tell us when theyre afraid, but the truth is that most women cant stomach it. In those moments when real vulnerability happens in men, most of us recoil with fear and that fear manifests as everything from disappointment to disgust. -Brene Brown Even *Saturday Night Live* just now mocked Kavanaugh for shedding tears over his calendars. From a feminine perspective, this makes no sense whatsoever...*a woman got sexually assaulted and you are crying over calendars?* The calendar, of course, was merely incidental. Kavanaugh choked up at the thought the person who started the tradition - his father, the primary model of masculinity in his life. He cried at memories of camaraderie with his friends - brotherhood, duty. The all too familiar feeling of humiliation, rage, disappointment, sadness, and injustice all rolled into one as his career - the major source of masculine purpose - gets dragged through the mud in front of the whole country. I recall reading on this sub once that when a woman watches *Saving Private Ryan*, she might as well be looking at static. She fundamentally lacks the ability to understand a man's emotional core. The strong, silent man is a masculine archetype for a reason. We tell boys not to cry for a reason. Insults such as ""pussy"" are there for a reason. Never cry in front of a woman, except when your parents die."
11,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Letting our anger go and learning to enjoy women for what they are,308,97wbmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/97wbmc/letting_our_anger_go_and_learning_to_enjoy_women/,2018-08-17 07:23:53,"Summary: If you think slutty women suck and you hate them, youre holding yourself back. Try to understand them instead. Sluts are FUN! Dont marry them, but for the love of God, enjoy them instead of despising them. __________________ A large number of readers here are recovering betas. Guys who previously sucked with women, but today suck a little less. Im writing to them. If youre a guy whos generally done all right with women for most of his life, and just need some fine-tuning when it comes to understanding intersexual dynamics, or if youre a guy whos never gotten anywhere with women in the past and today still suck and cant get laid to save your life, Im not writing to you. But to all recovering betas out there: We are our own biggest problem. When we were younger, we couldnt get girls. Not for sex, not for dates, not for relationships. Maybe an occasional date or girlfriend or lay, but just sprinkled here and there across an otherwise gigantic dry spell. Maybe we were scrawny or fat and hadnt gotten in shape yet. Maybe we were socially awkward and petrified of talking to girls and screwed it up every time we tried. Maybe we didnt understand the game and kept running off girls by trying to find girlfriends when everybody else knew to have casual sex instead. Today, were better at this, but back then, we were lucky to find anything. Meanwhile, all of the girls we would have liked to date, love, or fuck had no trouble with any of this. The majority of the girls we knew were having casual sex and short-term relationships, just with guys who understood the rules and didnt suck at the game the way we unknowingly did. For the girls, sex wasnt a big deal. It was just another activity. When youre hungry, you stop at McDonald's for a burger on the way home from work. When youre horny, you get your phone out and arrange a hook-up after work. Sex was just one more fun thing they did if they felt like it. The opportunity was always there, so having sex was never really a big deal to them. Today, all grown up, we know the rules and understand the game. Today, we can meet girls and with some reliability, we can have casual sex, and even a relationship if we want one. But when we learn that the women were spending our time with today were having casual sex during the times when we were lonely and struggling, we become angry. In many cases, were actually a little jealous. These women were doing exactly what we would have done if we had the same opportunities: treating sex like any other activity  a fun diversion when youre horny, a great source of physical pleasure, a great source of validation. But we didnt get to do that. They did. In our minds, it feels like these slutty women were spending our time with have a leg up on us by having all of these experiences we never had. Were not young kids, figuring things out together with our partners. She already figured all of this out with other guys long ago when we couldnt get anywhere with a girl. Today, were still enjoying our hook-ups because theyre fun and novel. Shes just scratching the horny itch, while were enjoying the new experiences. Even though its just casual sex, its more important to us than it is to her. When sex means something to us that it doesnt mean to her, we feel vulnerable. Vulnerability leads to anger. We tell ourselves that these women are bad. That slutty girls are some kind of inferior being that warrants bad treatment and only enough of our precious time and resources to get our dicks wet. We fantasize that there are still good girls out there who havent had casual sex and are worth so much more of our time, when even young virgins slut it up and treat guys like the ones we used to be horribly, when given the opportunity in a consequence-free environment. We let ourselves come to hate women and the way women are. Part of the reason we do this is to fight that vulnerability. Recovering betas are like stray dogs. Today, we have consistent sustenance, but each time its in front of us, we wolf it down like its going to be our last meal for a while, then prioritize the search for more. Its hard, if not impossible, for us to do what those women do and treat sex like its just another activity we do occasionally when were horny. After a lifetime of sex being absent from our lives  scarce - every single time feels important, like it might be the last one unless we keep working at it. Which leads us to spend hours thinking about intersexual dynamics, reading about it on the internet, always working toward the next time. And after a lifetime of sex being absent from our lives, its far too easy for us to become attached to every woman that will fuck us. Even today, with our grown-up abilities to meet women and have casual sex with some regularity, we still feel that urge in the back of our mind to dig in our heels, lock her down, make her ours, make a girlfriend out of her, get pissed if she sleeps with someone else. We almost feel grateful to the slutty women who have sex with us and hate ourselves for feeling that way about a slut. So we tell ourselves that slutty women are evil, lesser creatures to force ourselves to maintain distance and fight off emotional attachment. Dont get me wrong. Some slutty women (and even many non-slutty women) are sadistic, manipulative bitches. But most sluts are just lost little girls who want to be loved and cared for. And its a little sad that no guy (that they respect) will love or care for them the way theyd like, and instead they spend their time trying to feel less lonely and less unloved through casual sex. We can never truly recover from being the lonely guys we used to be until we let our anger go and let ourselves feel. Its okay to like the girls we fuck. Its okay to be nice to a slut if shes earned it. Its okay to feel things for the women were having sex with. Dont marry them, obviously, but until were comfortable feeling the full range of our feelings, including love, gratitude, and appreciation, toward women, and learning to understand and appreciate how they are, were never really free of our past."
12,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Do Not Rescue A Damsel In Distress,1,9b85ei,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/9b85ei/do_not_rescue_a_damsel_in_distress/,2018-08-29 20:43:03,"In my beta days, I **loved** Damsels in Distress (DiD). They were my kryptonite. There were girls in my life who were friends or acquaintances, who I'd have no interest in dating. But one day they'd be laid low by something going on in their life, and they'd open up to me, and I'd find myself falling for them (and them for me). I'd see a girl in genuine pain and be drawn to not just help her, but start caring about her. What can I say? They tempted me with their vulnerability. And I thought I was doing the right thing helping them out. Well, that's changed. For people like me with a weakness for Damsels in Distress, let me break down those Damsels, and explain why helping them is the worst thing you can do. Before I start though, a few caveats: 1. I'm not talking about White Knights(tm), like you see in forums here, randomly defending indefensible chicks to prove their feminist cred or get a nice pat on the head from a girl they want to bang. I'm talking an actual girl you know, who is facing something real. 2. I don't mean physical distress. If a woman -- or man -- is being attacked or abused, then goddamn help them, even if all you can do is call 911. No, I'm talking emotional distress. When they're sitting in a heap on your sofa bawling their eyes out. 3. I'm not talking about friendzoned guys who keep helping girls despite getting no reciprocal attention. They should just next the girl completely. I'm talking about situations where both of you end up falling for each other. You because she's your DiD, and her, because you're her knight in shining armor. Most of the times, it's still a bad, bad idea. Why are relationships with Damsels in Distress so toxic? You need to understand one basic thing about women: they love drama, ***regardless of if it's good or bad***. Guys generally hate drama, but will tolerate it if it's good drama, like two girls fighting over who gets to suck your dick first. And even that, we dispatch in a couple of seconds so we can get on with the BJ. Girls, on the other hand, love to stew in drama, marinate in it, stuff their lives with it. It makes them feel like their life is worth living, the fact that it's causing so much torment to them and people around them. That's why they do things that are completely unfathomable to guys, like stay with boyfriends that beat them, or cheat on someone because their life was ""too stable"". And what is Distress if not drama? So with that understanding, imagine a damsel who lives in a kingdom with lots of puddles of quicksand. She's walking home on a road with quicksand up ahead. How does she react? Depends on what type of damsel she is: 1. She's actually smart enough to spot the quicksand, goes around it, and continues on her merry way. This is the rare woman who doesn't like drama, is smart enough to spot it, and avoids it. She does not become a damsel in distress. 2. She doesn't see the quicksand and falls in. But she knows how to pull herself out of it. Which she does, and then keeps walking. This woman may not have been able to spot the drama, but she knows how to solve the problem herself. She may appreciate help, but doesn't need it. She doesn't stay a DiD for very long before getting out and continuing on. 3. She falls in and doesn't know how to get out herself. She must be rescued before she gets completely swallowed up and dies. This woman doesn't know how to spot drama, and doesn't know how to get herself out of it. But at least she *wants* to get out of the quicksand. So when a knight comes along and pulls her out, she's genuinely appreciative, falls in love with him, and they ride off into the sunset together. 4. She falls in, and realizes she kinda likes all the attention as all the villagers gather and try to help her out, express sympathy for her fate, and generally make her the star of her own hit drama show, maybe even making the nightly news. Although she won't admit it, she's secretly upset when a knight finally shows up, pulls her out, and all the villagers leave and quickly forget about her. Heck, she may even refuse the first few knights that come around, just so she can stay in the quicksand longer, until she's gasping for breath and about to be swallowed up completely. The knight who eventually saves her is perplexed because instead of a kiss, all he gets is an angry stare for his good deed. 5. This girl, when she hears that there's quicksand on a specific road, actually detours to take that road, then deliberately jumps in the quicksand. Why would anyone do such a thing? Because she's been rescued in the past so she thinks the risk of actually dying is low (there'll always be a knight around somewhere, right?), and until then, she loves the attention and being the center of all this drama. Indeed, as soon as she's pulled out by a knight, she goes looking for the next quicksand puddle to jump into. To her finding quicksand is far more important than figuring out where she's going and which road is the best one to get her there. If you decide to be her knight, you will spend the rest of your life getting panicked calls to come pull her out of quicksand that she's deliberately jumped into. Even if the sex afterwards is great, you will quickly become miserable with your life. With that breakdown of the different types, the key to this story is to reverse the scenario: imagine now that you're a knight, with a weakness for Damsels in Distress. You hope you can find one, rescue her, and she'll fall madly in love with you and you'll live happily ever after. IOW, you're hoping to find #3. To do so, you need to flip things around: when you come upon a random Damsel in Distress flailing around in quicksand, which one of the above 5 is she most likely to be? Even if all 5 are evenly represented among the women in this kingdom (which in real life, they're not), for any random DiD you come upon, which one of those 5 is she most likely to be? * She will never be #1, because those damsels are never in distress. * It's highly unlikely that she's #2, because she's usually pulled herself out before you even arrive. * It may be #3 (your dream girl), but remember, these damsels don't fall in quicksand very often, because they're not actively seeking it, and they get pulled out by the first knight that comes along, which means chances are, she's already gone by the time you come by. * That leaves #4, who enjoys being in the quicksand, and resents you for pulling her out, and especially: * \#5, who enjoys it so much that she actively seeks it out. So regardless of their distribution in the population, the distribution of damsels that you happen to find in quicksand at any given time is dominated by types 4 and 5, which will lead to misery for you. Okay. Enough about knights and damsels. What does this mean for the real world? It means that when you come upon a Damsel in Distress, you must realize that the chances are highly likely that the Distress was self-inflicted, she enjoys it, and will likely resent you for resolving it for her. If she's crying about her boyfriend cheating on her, understand that she most likely knew that was the type of guy he was when they started dating, but she decided to date him anyway because it means she will always be ""superior"" to him in the relationship i.e., she threw herself in that quicksand willingly. Or, she likes the attention she gets when she's crying, the sympathy from her friends for being ""wronged"" by her bf, and will not appreciate it if you solve her problem and cut short her moment in the sympathy spotlight. The chances of you actually finding a ""good"" DiD are exceedingly low. So there you have it. While every knight hopes for #1, 2, or 3, those are not the most frequent damsels found in distress. Most distress is willingly self-inflicted, even *desired*, by women, despite their protestations about how awful they feel. They are not looking for your help, and if you do help them, chances are, they will hate you for it even as you spend your life rescuing them, an increasingly tiresome chore. So stop looking for damsels in distress, and start figuring out where #1, 2, and 3 hang out. Usually, they'll be nowhere near quicksand. (Also, knights go to battle and get slaughtered. Do not be one just to indulge your rescue fantasies.)"
13,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Wow. Female contestants of reality TV shows such as Love Island regret their decisions. Who knew!?,343,9337g1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/9337g1/wow_female_contestants_of_reality_tv_shows_such/,2018-07-30 21:18:01,"A couple of months ago in class, I heard this term ""Love Island"" which confused me, everyone was talking about it in class and only by picking up the pieces of their words I realise it was basically a show for Chads to come in and show off and for Stacys to live off their temporary fantasy before falling to their doom that is social outcast and depression all while the people of Britain waste hours of their time over practically nothing. Luckily for us, our favourite tax-munching TV ""news"" channel, the BBC, has an article for us. URL I'm not going to get into too much, it's the same old song and dance, ""innocent wymen"" makes wrong decision and blames others for her mistake. To summarise, former Miss Great Britain Zara Holland lost her title because her having sex on the show invalidated her as a ""postive role model"", while I'm suprise to see such vigilant actions on the side of the Miss GB organisaiton, her reaction to this didn't suprise me, another article qoutes her reaction as &gt; She told the cameras: ""You know when you're in the moment and **it just happens. That's really not like me at all.** Why couldn't we have just gone to sleep?"" Ah yes, the core component of the feminist ideology, ItJustHappendism. That's not even a justification, she would've had more success saying ""I'm an independent women who loves to fuck, I can't believe Miss GB is so anti-feminist!"" But then again, she probably realise that it's 2018, not 2025 that she can announce her inner slutiness and still be smiled at by any respectable person who wishes to be seen beside her. We also have Sarah ""Dog-Lips"" Goodhart, who, as the BBC article states &gt; she accused the reality TV industry of being ""corrupt"" A couple of lines later &gt; admits not being honest during a psychological test to assess her suitability to appear on the show - because she wanted to be picked. Lady, just because it didn't go your way doesn't mean it's ""corrupt"". This sort of thinking is what leads to feminists advocating against this supposed ""wage gap"". And beside, you're not in a position to point fingers given that you yourself lied. I wouldn't be surprised if after the ink on the contract dried, her producers found out she was a lying piece of shit and decided to invest minimal time and money into her lying ass. If we look at Sophie Gradon, who had commited suicide some time ago, we can see that she perhaps is one the most innocent out of everybody taking a quick Google search on who she is, what I focus on is the lack of support she received specifically over the cyber-bullying and harassment she faced. I certainly think it's childish to bully someone on the internet- you might as well watch Love Island at least that doesn't take any braincells- it's important to note that when girls like Sophie Gradon enters programmes such as Love Island that will inevitable result in negative consequences, they will not recieve the support to compensate for it. Those Chads she fucked? They weren't there for her after she left. I would say to any female readers to pick the right guy, but I know that's futile. We still some more left, but I'll end this post off with a nice socialist propaganda from ""Behavioural psychologist Jo Hemmings"". She states 2 contrasting statements &gt; Jo Hemmings, who has worked on shows including Big Brother, says if she doesn't feel a contestant has the right coping mechanisms she would recommend they don't go on a reality show. She says the majority of the time her expert advice is listened to - but not always. You can tell this is a great figure of authority right here. &gt; ""I indicated there was some vulnerability and the producers hadn't done background checks officially and I had to ask this guy to leave in the middle of filming."" What does ""officially"" mean? Unless they were choosing to not conduct background checks that are mandated by the Government, there's no ""officially"" to be said here, and beside if they choose to break the law on background checks, you should report them to the police. &gt; She wants reality TV shows to offer more aftercare - of up to a year - for contestants once they leave a show. So Ms No-Authority here wants change, too bad, we all want things but we also have to work for it. Also, I previously mentioned ""socialist propaganda"", this is what I'm talking about, if the contract on the paper doesn't specify to the ""grown independent wymen"" about after-show help, then they are not entitled to get it. Also, if I was her, I think I'd want to block access to crazy lying women getting in on the show rather than just merely give ""advice"". But I suppose having contestants commit suicide or fall into a state of loneliness and depression is one of those ""bad publicity is good publicity"" thing. Hell, if it wasn't for that, I wouldn't have made an entire thread on TheRedPill about Love Island, so I'll leave this note with a teaching, watch what people do, not what they say."

The top, pinned post right now is the moderator making fun of Jordan Peterson's lecture on psychopathy and pick-up artists. He simply took a transcript from this speech[URL edited out all the punctuation to make it seem like a bunch of nonsensical ramble. Anyways, I thought this sub was supposed to bolster good quality content, not turn it into a fucking dumpster fire, especially one from the mods. Peterson's right. Forget all of your ridiculous notions about politics and ""conserva-cuck"" nonsense. Pick-up artists *are* inherently psychopathic. And the fact that *the* creator of this sub is upset about this is absolutely inane, and really goes to show where it's headed. If he knew anything about men and sexual strategy, he'd know that pick-up artistry doesn't actually fall in line, at all, with the ""Red Pill."" Let me repeat that again. *Pick-up is for low-status men.* ""Pick-up artists"" and teachers of ""pick-up"" use routines, verbal tricks, and superficial elements with the ""veneer of sophistication"" to trick women into thinking they are something they are not. Low status men who don't have the ability nor the potential to become what they *could be*, so they have to resort to displaying all the *behaviors* that a high status man naturally, outwardly manifests without being the high status man themselves. The ""Red Pill"" isn't about low status men trying to ""pick up"" women or manipulating them subconsciously (from both frames of reference, that is) into liking them. It's about becoming a truly high status man who naturally attracts women who lives for his own values and needs, regardless of others' opinions. Pick-up artists *are* borderline psychopathic. If you don't understand by now, you won't ever get it. Pick-up artistry manifests itself out of a low-line narcissism and inferiority complex, in which the men unconsciously try to manipulate women into appreciating them so their torn egos can be repaired (even if they disguise it to themselves as a method of attracting women). And why else? They don't view their target as an individual, but rather as a means towards an abstract goal which isn't truly noble in any sense of the world. They manipulate women into thinking they are something they are not, in order to further a goal. If that's not psychopathy right out of a textbook, I don't know what is. All this hate on Jordan Peterson is making me doubt that any of the mods or even ""endorsed contributors"" have any sense or understanding of *anything*. Ridiculous.  Women *are* the selectors of men. They represent the Chaos in nature which selects for the most evolutionarily successful menshaming those into vulnerability who do not meet up to the evolutionary standards of our species. They select from the male dominance hierarchy. And even if you disagree with the idea that ""pick-up"" and ""Game"" is inherently psychopathic (the psychological definition is extremely fuzzy), if you have any sense whatsoever about intersexual relations, you'd realize that ""pick-up"" and ""Game"" masquerade as facades for any true sense of climbing the male dominance hierarchy. Again, you're failing to distinguish between 1. ""pick-up"" and 2. true male sexual strategy. Pick-up takes low-status men and tells them to *act* and *speak* like high status men, which they aren't. True male sexual strategy takes low-status or high-status men, and helps them *become* high-status men. Instead of taking upon the evolutionary initiative to climb up the male dominance hierarchy, pick-up artists try to manipulate women into *thinking* they are worthy of reproduction, when in fact they are not. As a result, if the facade and veneer of sophistication succeeds, we get men who are inherently low status, unattractive, and have no real value fucking women who *think* they are high-status, attractive, and capable of climbing the dominance hierarchy. It's bad for society *and* high-status men.  Just because you disagree with one or two of Jordan Peterson's statements doesn't mean you should throw out the baby with the bathwater. He's studied, endlessly, the horrors Western civilization was capable of in the 20th century, and has a deep understanding of the human mind in every facet imaginable. He's a trained clinical psychologist, and not just any old one at that. He has over ten thousand citations on his psychology papers, he taught at the most prestigious university in the world, and wrote the best-selling non-fiction book in the Western world at the moment. He has good intentions. I can't believe how close-minded some of you could be to call him ""blue-pilled"" or any more of that blabber. In fact, he probably understands more about society, the political spectrum, and intersexual affairs more than any of you. No, he definitely does. Hes all for the individual and for the bolstering of young men both as individual, masculine beings and as benefactors of society. In fact, hes probably the first well-known public figure to speak about such important topics that directly relate to this subs motives in recent times. You should be *thanking* him for bringing a new light to masculinity and for fighting against the radical liberals and those who condemn toxic masculinity. Just because he knows certain things doesn't mean he has to speak about them in public. His ""credibility"" would be shot off the moment he mentions any real truths to society. You don't think Peterson knows *exactly* what women are attracted to? You don't think he knows *exactly* how bitter and resentful men are? You don't think he knows *exactly* how society is structured? How well would it go if he starts spewing out true female nature on some random podcast, or proves that society is run on a set of dominance hierarchies, and it's an inevitable fact that human nature will *always* tend towards these paradigms, *no matter what*? He's not a fucking retard. He knows exactly how all these things work. Just because he keeps his mouth shut so he can keep a living and not get death threats doesn't give you the right to start attacking him. I'd like to see how you measure up to the man himself. I dont agree with everything Peterson says himself, but not for the retarded reasons TRP higher-ups are attacking him for. Hes out to help you, and if you cant see what hes trying to do theres nobody coming to rescue you. Hes making your pathway to powerful masculinity and a healthy sense of what a man is much, much easier. Jesus, have some gratitude.  This dogma that has been circulating the sub, especially that by the endorsed contributors and moderators, is drowning us all. Dont any of you have anything better to do than hate on a psychology professor whos making radical changes, especially those that indirectly support a conservative political agenda? The only reasonable explanation is that none of his attackers have read a word of what hes preached or watched a single one of his acclaimed lectures. Petersons the man giving a sermon out on the mountain to thousands of eager listeners, and those who criticize him are a bunch of insignificant sheep roaming out among the fields below. If you have a real contention, stop complaining and have some respect for yourself. Peterson's words absolutely *should* be scrutinized. But not with half-hearted write-offs, pseudo-intellectual polemical attacks, ad hominem criticisms, and certainly not with satirical, biased posts which fail to present sufficient evidence against that which he argues. So I don't know where the fuck this sub is headed, but honestly I couldn't care less. If you all drive yourselves into the ground in a carnival of fury and self-righteousness, go right ahead."
15,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Social Engine Theory,1,939yxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/939yxd/social_engine_theory/,2018-07-31 11:09:20,"I've been thinking lately about the modern social dynamic between men and women on a macro scale; mainly I've been trying to tease apart the co-dependencies of our genders and move away from an isolated analysis of the benevolencies and malignancies of typical male/female traits. Like many of you, over a span of decades of experience with both genders I've come to the understanding that men and women have distinct, deeply primal, patterns of thought and behavior. When assessed from an isolated point-of-view some of these behaviors appear to be unmitigatedly detrimental to social advancement. For instance, the increasing degree of opportunistic behavior in women, particularly in re: mate selection and, more pointedly, mate discard. In the case of men, the innate (in most cases) desire to acquire female companionship despite the clear pitfalls of the concomittant self-inflicted vulnerability. Often times I remark on the ability of the human race to overcome what, from a purely logical angle, appears to be insurmountable 'fatal flaws' in their ability to act in their own best interest. For example, it is well known, particularly amongst the members of this forum, that women present the single largest personal threat to men on the face of the earth. A naive observer would list things like disease, poverty, violence and the like, as greater sources of personal threat to men than the inextricable companions in existence that we call women. But that would require the naive belief that there is no fate worse than death. A profound analysis of acceptable behavior in our modern society will reveal that in situations when pain that rivals loss of life itself is perpetrated upon our fellow men, only one being can, with the support of state and society, perpetrate such acts with little to no fear of retribution; that being is woman. Women have the ability, enshrined in law, to take away a man's children, property, reputation, and much more. When we men graduate from bachelors with little more than our lives as possessions to established members of society we inevitably pick up vulnerabilities: children, dependents, reputations, employees and the like. All of these vulnerabilities represent pressure-points where one could, by the careful and deliberate application of pressure, relegate a man to face a reality where in more than simply their personal existence is in jeopardy. Civilized society brought with it laws and order that, ideally, would make this variety of duress a crime, punishable and therefore deter-able, but in contrast our modern society has protected and even promoted the right of women to tread on these very vulnerable elements of a man's identity. The core reason is a fundamental disconnect between the self-preservative desires of man and the little-understood primal nature of man to be desired, ye, relied upon by women. A fitting metaphor would be to imagine a tribe of man who possessed an unrelenting urge to run over the edge of high cliffs. Clearly, this behavior is self-destructive something that is fully apparent to this tribe, yet the primal, unrelenting urge to do it is present in nearly every member. Something similar can be said of moderns man's affliction; by the age of 25 the broad majority of men are aware that women pose greater than existential threats to the well-being of themselves and their clan, yet regardless of how apparent this threat is (it is becoming more apparent by the decade) men are powerless to deter the continued devolution of mutual benevolence because of, what appears to be, a fatal flaw at the intersection of self and societal preservation. This dog has hounded man since the dawn of human civilization and has not been mitigated by even a single degree in millennia. Despite the gloomy outlook that such an argument presents, I propose to you, reader, that an even more dire fate appears to be brewing in our modern era. As I alluded to earlier in this dissertation, both man and women possess what appear to be, when viewed from an isolated perspective, detrimental behaviors. The saving grace in this arrangement is that when the system in its full dynamicism is observed these detrimental behaviors serve to enhance benevolent behaviors in the opposite sex. For instance, the opportunistic trait of women when it comes to selecting and exchanging mates serves to enhance the ambitious nature of men to become greater successes as a means to attract desirable women, who are often the most fervent adopters of opportunistic mate selection. In men, the seemingly negative desire to self-sacrifice themselves for the dependency of women reward women who are willing to subjugate and be vulnerable in the eyes of men. What is bad has been transformed to good by the polar nature of man and woman. But this balance relies entirely on the continued polar nature of the sexes. A worthy metaphor is that of the heat engine, essentially a mechanism by which work is done, that relies wholly on the insulation of a 'cold' side and a 'hot' side. The engine is completely dependent on the uncorrupted polarity between these two sides; if the 'cold' side begins to warm or the the 'hot' side begins to cool the existential integrity of the engine is corrupted. A similar attribute could be proposed in regards to the balance and dynamic between man and woman; each relies on the other maintaining a traditional masculinity and femininity so that the normally detrimental attributes of each gender is put to the purpose of enhancing the beneficial attributes of the other. But, just like in our heat engine, if these distinct gender attributes begin to co-mingle and mellow the power of the engine is corrupted. Both sides become lukewarm and the work of progress that the engine is responsible grinds to a halt. I fear that my personal observations suggest that this moderation of traditional masculine and feminine attributes is occurring with increasing ferocity in our modern era. I believe the primary factor is the feminization of men rather the masculinization of women, although both are occurring to some degree. As with many phenomena that represent sea changes in established processes; the inflection point may be quite drastic and the lead-in the inflection point may be inescapable after a certain point is crossed. Could it be that our generation will see a catastrophic loss of balance between the sexes and the untold consequences?"

17,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Appreciation post for TRP and PUA for getting me to where I dreamt of being 7 years ago,31,93d4a3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/93d4a3/appreciation_post_for_trp_and_pua_for_getting_me/,2018-07-31 19:54:20,"I credit most of my social success to these two communities and would like to write about how I got to where I dreamed to be. I found PUA at the ripe young age of 16 when I had my heart broken by a girl I crushed on for over a year. My first Google search was, how to get girls to like you. Down the rabbit hole I went! At the time, I felt that I could not relate to people, and that most people could not relate to me. I stumbled upon PUA sites, namely Neil Strauss. One of Neil Strauss first advice to me was to visualize where I wanted to be in 5 years. I was to conjure an image so vivid that it would become a self fulfilling prophecy. This is my image: I am at a club. Purple and blue lights are flashing everywhere. I am surrounded by beautiful women who love me for who I am, my homies going around spreading love and showing respect. Money litters the table. There is a deep trust. I am calm, content, and collected. I am not nervous nor shy nor lonely. That image was my dream. It was more of a feeling, anchored down by this vivid image. It was who I wanted to be. I wanted to be connected. I wanted people to want to connect with me. I wanted to be sexually satisfied and have an abundant pool of ladies waiting for me. I wanted respect. For years I watched videos by Mystery, Christian Hudson, Neil Strauss, David Deangelo. Read books like The Game, No More Mr. Nice Guy, and Models. Read guides by Pook and tens of others. Joined forums like highschoolpua, TRP, Mystery Lounge, and such. For years I went out and faced rejection, over and over again, pushing myself in clubs, bars, parks, libraries, cafs, and house parties. These experiences numbed me to what others thought of me. It suppressed my ego and taught me perseverance. It also taught me what creepy meant, how to hold eye contact, and how to touch. I had my first relationship when I was 17, but lost everything because I was too clingy and demanding. I realized my inner state of mind was keeping me from happiness. I was still not happy with who I was and the people that surrounded me. So I kept going. I picked up guitar, singing, and weight lifting. I reached out to like minded people on the path of self improvement and found myself my first mentor. My circle of friends expanded and improved. I found Red Pill when I was 20. The most significant things I learnt here was stoicism, frame, and vulnerability. I worked towards strengthening my inner belief in myself and reducing nervous reactions towards outside influences. I pursued leadership positions that forced me to speak in front of hundreds of people. I started performing music to people I knew. I started speaking from my heart and saying what I believe even if it was harsh. I started writing honestly about my experiences and posted them on this forum. I gained another mentor when I was 23 who really pushed me to practice my communication skills religiously. He would ask me what I thought of different topics (life, parents, business) and drill with me until I was able to express myself clearly and completely. This, he said, would allow me to work with the top .01% of the population. I applied my new method of communication to my family, friends, and pickup and found that honest, transparent and coherent communication was the fastest path to respect and love. If you only speak the truth, then there is no miscommunication, no stress. Today I have a lot of what I dreamed of having, except for that cash on the table. A girlfriend who I am sexually attracted to who loves me for who I am. A large group of loyal and high SMV guy friends who have known each other for 5+ years. A pool of girls waiting for me to be single. Low ego (acid and shrooms helped). Calmness in my heart without chasing drugs or women. Zero social anxiety. I can go speak in front of hundreds without fear. Ability to communicate clearly and honestly from the heart both in writing and verbal. Its been 7 years and I have seen so much progress. To the newbies on this sub striving for improvement, it can be done if you keep trying and applying. Hold onto your dreams. Visualize it day in day out until you dream of it. I truly believe that visualization of your goals is a fail-safe way of self improvement. Tldr; OP reminisces about his 7 year journey down the red pill rabbit hole and how he now has most of what he dreamt of having. "

I apologize for the resolution; the tweet was deleted not long after I commented on it and I had to rely on screen captures. What youre looking at here is an exchange between a very invested Blue Pill guy and the thought process guys like this typically go through when the woman theyve made their everything wants them gone. Theres a lot going on in this and I wanted to parse it out here. When youre Red Pill aware for any length of time it can sometimes be confusing to see the thought process that Blue Pill conditioning predisposes a guy to. The Red Pill Lens is one of the gifts (and curses) of having unplugged, and internalizing the awareness can make us somewhat confused or jaded to the experiences of guys who are still plugged in and trying to make their blinded understanding of intersexual dynamics work for them. Can this guy really not see why this girl wants to get away from him? From a Red Pill perspective we might think this guy is an idiot for not seeing what hes doing. Its plain as day for us so their must be something wrong with him, right? Usually, the only thing wrong is that these guys Blue Pill conditioning has limited them to understanding their situations from that old set of books  the rule set that they believe (like a religion) that quality women acknowledge and play by too. Lets try to put this jadedness aside for a moment. &gt;&gt;[] I cant take my mind off of you no matter what I do and yesterday I literally cried for an hour in my room because I didnt know what to do. I just really need you in my life and it kills me to know that I have messed our relationship up, This kids (it reads like hes an adolescent) whole exchange is riddled with self-incrimination. This is an intrinsic part of Blue Pill conditioning  the guy is always at fault in any break up. Even with his now exs admission of her own complicity in their split, hell have none of it. If a relationship, a marriage, fails it is always because a guy wasnt invested enough; even if she cheated on him the Blue Pill conditioned mind will only accept his complicity in her looking outside the relationship. I should also add that this is an integral part of the Promise Keepers mentality as well as the Oprah-Marriage Counselor Approved notion that relationships take a lot of work and its always a mans responsibility to qualify himself for a womans intimacy by maintaining that work. As a result, the Blue Pill mind automatically defaults to self-blame and looks to find ways to negotiate some kind of new work-program that will fix the broken relationship he somehow caused. Blue Pill conditioned men are still men, and as such they default to the deductive reasoning that were largely predisposed to. So in that Blue Pill state it seems like logic to look for solutions that will put the relationship back together again. This is how Blue Pill mens minds work; they have a set of (Old Books) rules they believe everyone is, or ought to be, playing by and since he also believes the lie of coequal agency (blank-slate) between men and women he thinks a womans desire and intimacy can be deductively bargained with. He realizes his failing and will be sure to correct it. But thats not how all this works. In fact, its this very acknowledgement that only reinforces this womans decision to leave him. Hypergamy is rooted in doubt, and it turns out he is as Beta and optionless as her Hypergamous hindbrain suspected. His reaction to her confirms it. &gt;&gt;[] how can you just cut me out of your life so quickly? I want to make things better and work on our relationship because I know what it can be, why dont you want to work on it? Im trying to avoid most of the clingy emotional shit in this exchange. Blue Pill guys will pepper in their emotive state even in the best of times in a relationship, but when theyre facing a break up, thats when all the stuff hes been taught about vulnerability being a strength turns into a huge liability for him. Not to mention it disgusts the woman leaving him. Here we see the standard Blue Pill bewilderment over why this woman hes deeply invested in can so casually blow him off and move on. Isnt she playing by the same rulebook hes been playing by since he learned to dutifully put women as his mental point of origin? I linked my War Brides essay in his quote above because this is the nuts and bolts reason as to how women can, and often do, move on so quickly. It is literally part of womens preinstalled mental firmware to have the capacity to turn on a dime with their emotions. Next he makes the Blue Pill appeals to Relational Equity and declares his willingness to work on the relationship in order to fix it. In a breakup this work on the relationship narrative works against women; particularly if the guy theyre leaving is overly invested in equalism. Hes been taught that open communication is the key to any healthy relationship so hes confused as to why his coequal soul mate wouldnt want to work on things and patch it up. When things are good the work on things narrative is a benefit for women getting the things they want, but when she wants to leave a Blue Pill guy (usually because she wants to open herself to better Hypergamous options) its a leash around her neck. Why doesnt she want to work on the relationship?"
19,vulnerability,TheRedPill,The surprising science of alpha male primates,8,94d917,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/94d917/the_surprising_science_of_alpha_male_primates/,2018-08-04 06:42:36,"[Watched this great talk by the guy who popularized the term 'Alpha Male'](URL A few weeks back I wrote a post on my experiences with empathy and vulnerability and how women are drawn to these qualities in me and wanted to continue that conversation in come way. As someone somewhat new to this community it appears to me that there's occasionally some conflict or confusion on what it means to 'be alpha'. Some people say being alpha is being as Machiavellian and near sociopathic as is possible. Others say fuck that, being alpha is all about not caring what others think and doing whatever you want and feel like even if that means being vulnerable. I see truth in both of these stances, but something about them has always felt incomplete to me based on my experiences in groups and seeing the people who tend to have the most respect and the most influence in any given social circle. For me I think there is often missed the social component of what it means to be alpha, that is, that you can not be alpha without an other or group to surrender to you as alpha. Being alpha is completely inseparable from someone being submissive. There is no such thing as someone who is alpha unless there is also someone who has submitted to that person. I think this Ted Talk touches on a lot of what it means to be an alpha within the context of others (community). With so much weight being put on doing what makes us an an individual man happy and following our own passions in TRP discourse (rightfully so) I also find myself curious about the social functions of what it means to be an alpha. There's a lot of interesting and (at times) unexpected elements of being an alpha primate discussed in this video. I'll only share a couple bullet points I found intriguing and not ruin the whole thing because if you're curious you should watch the damn video yourself tbh. * Alpha males are often the most empathic member of the entire tribe * The only member of the tribe with equal or more cortisol (stress hormone) is the lowest ranking male. Everyone else in the tribe is less stressed than the alpha. * It's not uncommon for the alpha to have less power than older, more influential, but less physically capable members of the tribe For me one of the biggest takeaways here is that the ideal alpha is not the one who gets everything he wants. Rather the ideal alpha, from a social lens, is the one who is best able to give everyone in the tribe everything *they* want and only gets what he wants so long as he is able to fulfill that function. That is the transactional nature of being alpha. As soon as someone is better able (or perceived as better able) to fulfill that role of giving then that person will be recognized as the alpha (hypergamy). Essentially how alpha you are perceived is entirely dependent on your ability to give. Not only physically, which is perhaps usually the focus here, but also emotionally and, if I might venture to add my own theory, spiritually - which I believe is what frame control ideally accomplishes: giving people a better (higher value) and more solid (real) frame within which to exist and express themselves. I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences on what being alpha means to you in relation to social circles."

But when I goes into LTR mode with one of the plates, I got dumped! because I think that by being vulnerable makes her accept me for who I am and help me in times of trouble.I trust her that much. We've been in LTR for 2 years. First 1 year and half we're living the best day of ""romance"". But for the last 5 months or so I've been having problems with my job and my family, my parents become terminally I'll and I'm their only child so I've spent my time them. This is when I need her the most. And yeah she just dumped me like that . I don't blame her, I blame my own true knowledge of redpill and not controlling her hypergamous nature.

21,vulnerability,TheRedPill,"The ""Redpill"" Guide for Women - A Guide to Unhealthy Relationships and Emotional Manipulation",196,8v1vin,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/8v1vin/the_redpill_guide_for_women_a_guide_to_unhealthy/,2018-06-30 23:34:30,"There is now a ""Red pill guide"" for women : [URL \-- This channel was a really good example of how it gets to that point: The whole premise is to increase Beta behaviour in men in order to control a relationship. A woman's end goal is ultimately, commitment. **If it affects you,** your behaviour will **repel future women**, and make past relationships harder to get over. What I see a lot of guys do is put themselves in a dangerous situation, and excuse it with friendship/plating. Sure, the friendship may be there (since they've obviously dated/known the girl,) but the unhealthy aspects of it and how it affects your future relationships with girls aren't worth it at all. **An excerpt from the video:** **An extreme way to use the rule of 3 is to show the guy you love him, breakup with him, and then take him back. If the guy loved you hes going to be drastically hurt over the breakup because he felt so certain of you. And like most men, when he loves a girl, hell take her back if she returns. The return will make him love you even more than before, even though there might be a little resentment for a short time. Make sure to massage his ego in the meantime in order to slowly dissolve his resentment for you breaking up with him.** **In other words: How to take advantage of a man, and waste his time without being labeled a cheater.** Other ""tactics"" include: **Dumping you for another guy when the relationship is at its' peak** When you're legitimately invested in that girl, it hits hard. The moment you tell her it ""felt real to you"" and that It's the exact same type of conditioning that causes oneitis and men to beg pathetically because you're still on that relationship high. Especially when the relationship was casual, you haven't even had sex yet - it becomes easy to see a version of her that isn't real. Most guys want to play it cool, and not make it such a big deal, so they stay in contact with her. It's cruel, and it leaves you wondering ""what did I do wrong?"" **Mentioning guys she's dating/having sex with, of other races.** ""I'm seeing this guy from Finland, btw. He's really cool and..etc."" Biggest no-no. Keep your pride and NEXT her if she ever talks about other men she hooks up with. If you're willing to sit around and listen to the guys she's had sex with ""because she was drunk,"" there is a huge problem. It's a power move intended to make you want her more than she's really worth - especially if you know at a logical level, that she isn't somebody you'd ever be with again. If she talks about other guys in your presence, tell her ""that's cool,"" and immediately next. You lose value every time you stick around and put up with it. **Tells you she doesn't want you back, misses her other exes, but it's not you.** This is similar to the last tactic, and has the same function. What's the point of telling you that she misses her other exes? Girls who don't care about getting you back won't even bother to share. **Garnering Sympathy once trust/friendship is gained:** ""The only attractive thing about me is my hair/face/ ...etc."" The ""poor me,"" response. Also used so you feel as if you have to reciprocate, if she's being nice/friendly to you. **All of these tactics are designed to lower your self esteem/cut you down so it provokes an emotional response of desperation and neediness. It happens at a level that you are unaware of.** The whole purpose is to leave an open wound in case they ever regret breaking up with you and want to come back. Let's say, if the girl was being cringey, saying ""I'm sorry, and please take me back"" out of desperation or slashed your tires...etc. ""Overt crazy"" is much easier to deal with because it's clear that you are in danger and should cut the person out. It becomes **much more subtle when it takes a toll on you that you're unaware of.** Psychologically, the person has already affected you negatively but you can't see it in daily interactions. **Rejection, for example, is one of the ways to do it.** The purpose of rejection is to **cut down on your self esteem,** make you take blame for things that you didn't do (**try to convince you that you cheated on her, for example, when she was the one who jumped on another man,)** while you were faithful. **Sexual rejection** is one of the main ways that women stay in control in relationships. If she **TELLS** you about the men s**he's with, it has a similar effect that tears down your self esteem. Most guys just don't want to make it a big deal, feel like the ""nice guy"" that gets butt-hurt, and plays it cool/doesn't care. You lie to yourself** If you become desperate enough, you'll believe her and even forgive her because you haven't **seen** her physically cheat on you. **It allows them to experiment with whoever they want,** **without being labelled a ""cheater,"" all the while taking up your emotional energy to leave you as a ""back-up"" option.** Even if these tactics aren't ""implemented,"" and happen anyway, the results are the same. How do you know when it's happening? Most guys don't know they developed oneitis until the relationship is over and they **rationally reflect on what's happened and realized they were acting crazy for all the excuses they made for themselves, and for her and the fact that they would never go back to her.** You don't want to be a total jerk, so you remain **""friends.""** **It's the most toxic thing to do.** \-- **It produces white-knight behaviour where you feel as if you have to defend her.** In reality, it is your body's response to defending yourself - because **defending somebody that treated you like garbage to fuck another guy goes against your survival instinct.** It's the same thought process people use to defend stupid decisions they make, because they don't want to feel stupid for making it in the first place - so they defend that decision even if they logically know it's ridiculous. **It trains your mind into believing it's OK that she did what she has done, even though it would be humiliating/a turn off in a normal situation.** That can even become addictive, and you feel compelled to ""keep up"" with her. Excuses like ""but we're still friends"" comes up, and you refuse to see the facts of the situation. **At TRP, we look down on beta behaviour.** When you're younger, it's a phase that every guy goes through when you don't see the reality of the situation, and you learn to become wiser over time. What is commonly misunderstood is that it's not only inexperience that causes the behaviour, but also the fact that you can be susceptible to it at any time. ESPECIALLY when the relationship was cut off abruptly, or for no apparent reason at all. It's not about being ""Alpha,"" or ""Beta."" Imagine a drug user being addicted to a drug. They'll humiliate themselves, beg, and do anything to get that high. It's completely cut into their sense of self and feels ""good"" at the moment. They need it to feel normal. **Any normal guy could sink to that level, if broken down enough.** Now imagine if that drug were always around, while you are a recovering addict. When that happens, you're much more inclined to believe that you were the one who messed up in the relationship, even **IF she was the one who decided to date somebody else/cheat on you/disrespect you. You want to get back to ""normal,"" no matter what the consequence is.** **Even if that includes harming the people around you while rationalizing it to yourself.** **You're harming yourself, and other people too because nobody can get through to you, despite the red flags.** \-- **Red flags:** **General Tips and Red Flags** If it makes you act completely irrational and idiotic - it will fuck up your whole life when you start excusing her behaviour for her ""quirks."" Women more likely to employ these tactics?: People who have antisocial tendencies simply don't care, it doesn't affect them are more likely to be capable of employing these tactics. **-Women who like the power of multiple guys coming to ""beg"" for them.** **-Displays arrogant/prideful traits, think they are above everyone else.** **- Psychotic/Antisocial types who think they're the center of the entire world - and anybody who doesn't feed into that idea is against them-Irresponsibility, and a lack of discipline.** \*\*-\*\***Substance abuse (binge drinking), impulsivity** \*\*-\*\***Disregard for morals, social norms.** \*\*-\*\***Promiscuity** (Multiple partners, not knowing who the father** is**...) For the long term, they make awful partners. They are people who are incapable of wanting to change, and acknowledging their own faults. The wiki says it best: **Impairments in interpersonal functioning (a or b):** a.Empathy: Lack of **concern for feelings, needs, or suffering of others; lack of remorse after hurting or mistreating another.** b.Intimacy: Incapacity for mutually intimate relationships, as **exploitation is a primary means of relating to others, including by deceit and coercion; use of dominance or intimidation to control others.** \-- **Onto you:** Once you're invested, she's able to get away with a lot. Triggering ""chase"" instinct from the past loss, bringing up suppressed emotions from past relationships that aren't resolved and build up over time is an extremely risky move. \&gt;Could make you do something irrational, you have complete tunnel vision and end up chasing .. **She dumped you for another guy while you completely invested yourself into only dating her?** ""She was just in a bad time in her life, it's OK. We can still be friends. She's still a good person."" **She talked badly about you in your social group?** ""She was probably just drunk that time, and didn't mean it."" **She's slept around, regretted it, and said the guy was abusive/cruel to her?** ""Those are rumours from gossipy/jealous girls because she comes from a conservative family and wouldn't think of doing anything wrong."" She ends up having so much control that you excuse her actions, especially if she's nice to you afterward or shows a little bit of insecurity/vulnerability to buy your sympathy. \-- What's bad is not when you make a mistake, understand it, and fix it. That's not a big deal. What IS a big deal is if you continue to talk to her and rub salt in that wound created in the past. **You've been castrated from other connections that could have been much better. It's an effective form of control.** **When you start believing her completely, anyone who criticizes her is racist, jealous, mean to her, instead of looking at the evidence and facts of the situation.** **When your level of logic sinks to that level, you need to get out.** That's natural. How it impacts you long term?: **You'll never be able to live life because you start idealizing her over time. Any form of stress in your present life can drag you back into a relationship that you would logically never go back to. You need to take control of the situation and not allow it to happen.** It makes it harder to move on because you still carry that in your present life. \-- **TL;DR** Don't be a colossal idiot, of such gigantic proportion, that you would tolerate a woman dumping you simply because she wanted to experiment with others, **under the pretext of ""it's just not the right time,"" and looking sorry.** There's a difference between empathy for those who deserve it, and throwing out your resources for somebody who didn't give a damn about yours. Preserve your dignity. Don't drag the remains of old relationships into the future. If she's stringing you along, throwing you crumbs of attention, and disrespects you; **immediately block and delete.** **No exceptions.** It trains your mind to think it's ""OK"" to put up with that behaviour, just because they are being friendly to you."
22,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Be a Good Son,13,8v2ux9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/8v2ux9/be_a_good_son/,2018-07-01 02:13:24,"My father got a bad case of the flu a few days ago, my mother was in Malta so the timing was unpleasant. And this is on top of his business hurting recently + a long time employee of his screwing him over. I decided it would be a good idea to surprise him by coming down and making our family's recipe for chicken soup, which he loves, so I did. At the end of the day we had a moment that shook my soul in a way I wish words could fully describe to you, but they can't. It was on my way out, when he was huddled up on his side in bed. I took his hand, kissed him on the top of his head, gave him a bear hug and said, ""I'm sorry you're going through all this pop. Please don't be prideful and do call me if you need anything or just want support even a little bit. I'm going to head out now, I love you."" He turned to face me, squeezed my hand and said ""Thanks a lot for coming down son, it really means a lot to me.... it really means a lot to me."" In my whole life my father has never doubled down on vulnerability like that, nor spoken in the way he did. He's said kind things to me before but he's always been guarded about it, stating them as if they're a matter of fact rather than from the heart, like ""of course I love you son."" I have since learned from gaining some perspective that this is because I am the person my father actually loves most in this world, and as a guy bullied relentlessly growing up he has issues with vulnerability. Thus he puts up an overly tough front. But not this time. My 6 foot tall dad seemed so small and vulnerable in that moment. I saw a fear in him I hadn't ever seen before, and in the pause before he stated ""it really means a lot to me"" the second time, there was almost an element of surprise, as in he was surprised at *how* much it meant to him. In hindsight I realized it was because where he used to appreciate my support, he's starting to feel that now he is beginning to *need* it. My father no longer is just middle-aged to me, he is on the cusp of entering elderliness. In the second time he stated that it meant so much to him there was acceptance, and relief. I cried when I got home that night. Say what you will, but understand what it means when a generally ruthless and stoic guy like me can only describe the experience as profoundly poetic. It was as sad as it was beautiful; beautiful because I am lucky enough that I gained the wisdom to repair my relationship with him long ago, and got close enough to him that I got to have this moment. Also because I realized from that point onward I will be watching my father wither and fade. And for so many more reasons than I care to list. Some of you may think I projected some of the above unto him, but 1. Trust me that when your parent displays a way of being that's been absent from the entirety of your history with them, you'll recognize it, and 2. I talked to him about it afterward and he admitted it all. (ha!) And of course he did so in his matter-o'-fact tone. But ever since then he's been softer in his speech and demeanor. I can only accept that something has changed that will never be the same again. I truly get that some of you were attracted to TRP because of a need for masculine guidance, and because some of you come from broken families, or at least dysfunctional ones. Believe me, I get that if either of your parents are truly abhorrent then the effort to potentially make the relationship better is not worth the cost to your mental health. But I will say, no matter what, forgive your parents their failings. (forgive =/= enable) For they gave you life, and if you truly didn't value that you would not still be here. If you can, learn their personal history, what they went through in their formative years, how they got along with their siblings, how their parents treated them, their best and worst experiences. Learn how they handled growing into adulthood. Learn about the general climate of their culture's era, the history of their time. Doing so gives you a context for how your parents treated you, it de-personalizes it, it helps you be unaffected by the bad since it's no longer about you, it's about them. Your parents likely carry as much or more hurt around as you do. A stranger in the street insults you and it leaves you unaffected, but the same from a parent means more only because you tell yourself it should. Many people have trouble taking their parents off the deity-like, chiseled, perfect marble pedestal that we ALL had for them when we were vulnerable ignorant children facing our creators. But part of growing up is humanizing your parents. You may think that they can never change, but what is certain is that for you nothing will change if you don't become the change. It wasn't overnight I could respond to my father's constant testing of my frame, verbally jabbing my sore spots, trying to instigate me with love, a hug, taking none of it seriously. Like an adult would do to a mischievous child. It was not overnight that I could respond to what at the time felt like emasculating amounts of coddling from my mother with appreciation and recognition that she was just doing what she felt she needed to in order to feel like a good mother. But since learning to do so, both my parents no longer exhibit said behavior. You'll need to become independent, in every sense of the word, if you want a shot at this. Do so. I say to you, your parents will get old, they will get sick, they will die, and they'll need help on their way out. You don't need them to be nice or receptive to find catharsis in relation to them. If your parents are so broken that they seek to destroy you, then at least try to find it in yourself to pity instead of resent them. If your parents mean well for you, then regardless of whether you agree with their views or methods be appreciative of their efforts and sacrifices. As you reach the age where we learn to become whole, they will begin to break down. Like it or not, wide-eye baby-you absorbed input from them like a sponge, and if you look within yourself it will be impossible not to see a reflection of your parents looking back. So do yourself a favor and be a good son."
23,vulnerability,TheRedPill,"A Psychology Grad Student's Experience with Vulnerability, Empathy, and Attraction",199,8l7suh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/8l7suh/a_psychology_grad_students_experience_with/,2018-05-22 16:11:01," I've only very recently swallowed the red pill, went through the anger, depression, and am working on acceptance and integration right now. Everything TRP teaches overlays well with so much of my experiences that I'm almost upset I didn't swallow the damn thing sooner. That being said, there are a few things taught by TRP that do not correspond with my experience of reality with women , namely that vulnerability and empathy are repulsive to women. A little background I am getting my MA in counseling psychology in a feminist cultured private college that is 70&amp;#37; female and almost half the males are gay. Masculine men are very rare here, I would say that I have only ever met 3 other real alpha personalities in my 3 years of school. We are trained to be vulnerable and empathic as part of the job. I'm good at it. Very good. I really don't give a shit what anyone thinks about me and when I'm in a position where vulnerability and empathy are required of me I don't hold back. I share my honest internal response with people and when I am asked to act as 'the client' and be vulnerable so that someone can practice working with clients I give them my authentic vulnerable self even if it's fucking messy. It helps a lot that I have a talent for communication and a well\-developed emotional vocabulary from a great deal of practice \(this did not come naturally to me as it does not for most men\). Girls. Fucking. Love it. I have had a session where I was the client and told this girl extremely intimate things about how isolating and sad it can feel at times having moved cross country to go to this school and being so far away from anyone who loves or truly gives a shit about me and how difficult it is to form real connections with people in a new city. After the session she gave me her number \(which is extremely unethical in our profession, technically speaking\) and soon after she's texting me nudes, telling me how she shaved everything just for me, and we're fucking. I'm still plating her 6 months later. Girls are constantly sniffing around and putting themselves in my orbit. The amount of married and engaged women that flirt with me without shame is insane. They literally just can't help it. There appears to be something intoxicating about male vulnerability to these women that I do not yet fully understand. I don't have a concrete theory around this yet, at least not one that I can fit into a red pill frame as I am still very new to TRP, but I am quite confident that vulnerability and empathy can be carried and owned in a masculine way that does indeed attract and turn women on in a way that game by itself just can't. From what I've read so far I think most people associate vulnerability with weakness and empathy with losing frame. This has not been my experience with either of these. If you are vulnerable in a way that has complete ownership of your feelings, in other words you're not looking for support or nurturing for these feelings and are seeking only their honest and unfiltered expression with a DGAF attitude, it can be extremely attractive to women because it is not coming from a place of weakness. I'm talking about being vulnerable in the same way that an artist is vulnerable, not in the way that a depressed beta who needs a mommy is. There's a very different felt sense that women get about these two kinds of vulnerability. When you own your vulnerability in such a way that it can't be attacked \(like the artist does because the artist creates value through their vulnerability by creating a shared sense of humanity through it\) it is worthy of a woman's respect because it is difficult to do without appearing weak. The seconds it comes off as needy or wanting in any way though, it causes sexual repulsion and/or triggers the nurturing 'mommy response'. Likewise, at least in my experience, empathy is often times respected because is demonstrates social intelligence. Empathizing in such a way that you lose your frame, however, is dangerous and can quickly turn into supplication which is not respected. It's a thin line to be sure, but completely doable in a masculine way and without losing frame. I find that empathizing with a women makes them much more comfortable submitting to my frame as well because it fosters trust. It's also important to note that I only display these things somewhat infrequently to any one person \- maybe once a week at most. I feel like if vulnerability or empathy was just the common experience someone has of me it would be unattractive very quickly as I would no longer be mysterious and my internal life would lose value to them as it becomes easily accessible. All things in moderation. Just wanted to share these insights and observations from my experience with them. I'm sure some people will be happy to tear into them and completely discard these insights and to you I only wish I could show you how much attraction I get on the daily whenever I show masculine vulnerability and accurate empathy. The power it has is very real. It is also worth mentioning that we have an entire section of our program dedicated to how to handle clients that have erotic feelings towards us as therapists because it is so incredibly common for a client to become sexually attracted to their therapist and therapists fucking clients is a surprisingly big issue in our profession. I can write so much more on this and might one day if anyone actually gives a fuck. Just wanted to share those thoughts and spark some conversation. **TL;DR:** It has been my experience that vulnerability and empathy can be VERY attractive to women when it is divorced from neediness or wanting and when it comes from a masculine place and occurs relatively infrequently \(scarcity and mystery create value and challenge\)."

And every single one of them, i have been thrown under the fucking bus once some new guy came around. The newest relationship I have, that I guess officially ended today, I cared so much for her and always supported her. And she was excited about me the first few weeks. Then grew to be almost indifferent about everything I'd say to her, yet wouldn't break up with me. It's like she would go along with my flirting, but she couldn't care less about me. Well 1 month ago she suddenly goes quiet. She wont fucking talk to me. I ask her what's wrong and she doesn't have much to say. And I start seeing her post snapchat stories every other day getting all close and cuddly with her ex. And I ask her what's going on and she wont fucking talk to me. Today I tried to have a talk with her, tried to have good communication and be on the same page, and she ignored everything I said. For so long I cared for this girl, showed my vulnerability to her and wanted to be a team, and she fucking ditched me without hardly saying a word. Except ""sorry I'm busy"". I guess we have broken up? God damnit!!! Every single relationship I have ever been in has ended similarly to this!!! This is fucking bullshit!! If this is what dating is generally like then I no longer want any part of it. I don't know how I'll ever be able to trust a girl again after all this. Fuck these pieces of shit. I am so angry, I just need to vent in here."
25,vulnerability,TheRedPill,32 more RP and relationship tenets - learned the hard way,66,8lu6g5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/8lu6g5/32_more_rp_and_relationship_tenets_learned_the/,2018-05-25 02:52:42,"1) Know the betaization process and how to counter its phases. Even if you don't read anything else in this list, know this. Testing - Exclusivity - Vulnerability (communication) - Domestication and Servitude - Loss of attraction - Nothing's good enough - I'm independent - Cheat - Divorce or breakup - Rinse and repeat In this process an alpha male sought by multiple women gets turned into a slave and in the process attraction is lost. There is no male equivalent, because no man gains anything that involves his mate becoming unattractive. 2) Know the betaization process! No seriously, KNOW the betaization process! 3) Dating gives you the space and a dedicated environment to start a fresh cycle of escalation - it separates the sex from the other mundanities. LTRs don't give you that space, unless you create it. Too many men forget the whole sequence of attraction and treat sex like masturbation just before bed. That kills it. 4) We rely much more on the environmental setup to assist us than we realize. You cannot escalate in an environment that does not help you kick start the attraction process. You have to create a setting dedicated to your story. The good news is, if you're clever, all the world can be your stage, just as you can find women everywhere. 5) Sex, despite producing pair bonding chemicals is the least trustworthy emotion. Conservative societies had to force restraint and morality down people's throats for a reason. This is true even if you're a sex god. 6) The pill fucks with women's emotions and their mate preferences - it interrupts their natural cycle (leading to pregnancy, childbirth and oxytocin) and their ability to pair bond. It's so bad that a woman who loved you while on the pill can get totally repelled by you off it, and vice versa. 7) Even the most beta guy will find his girl suddenly pleading with him to stay if he decides to opt out of a lost cause. 8) Don't allow a woman to define a man for you. First, it's betaization. Second, women have no idea what it's like to be a man. 9) Women are compartmentalized, fluctuating, confused and highly cognitively dissonant - more than a time paradox. But underneath all waves, there is a tide - and that unerringly follows AWALT. Most of a woman's behaviour and instincts are actually subconsciously and biologically driven, despite all their attempts to blame it on social conditioning and their favourite cliche' - stereotype. (These cases are often AWALT on steroids). BTW : Stereotype is a NAWALT argument. All women will say that not all women are like that - get it? AWALT QED. 10) Overcome your fear of old age / loneliness / poverty / disease and death. Lift, do yoga, meditate, cook, eat right, strengthen your mind - most of your neediness will be gone. Modern healthcare is a black hole - prevention is the best medicine. 11) NEVER stop lifting. NEVER stop reading. NEVER stop improving. Your attempts to keep yourself alpha will create sexual tension in the relationship. Don't let that tension slack or your sex life will be like a flaccid penis. 12) Let her move in only if you plan on marrying AND having kids. 13) Have a second life planned in the blueprints that doesn't involve her, you will need it. 14) As she uses a positive-negative-positive (PNP) feedback cycle for getting you dependent on sex, you should do a PNP for commitment. You have a built in cycle (""men are rubber bands"") for this already. Make her hungry for you, but do not go so far that she starves to death. *Use dread and separation to make her miss you or give her subconscious tingles. Subtle is powerful. 15) Equality is a goddamn lie! Women only want equality for themselves, never for men. Feminism makes ugly women, ugly thoughts, ugly beliefs, ugly men, ugly kids, ugly families, uglier societies and even uglier nations, because beauty is apparently a social construct. It's a philosophy of ugliness, inside and out. The greatest damage done to women has come from feminism and other women. 16) See what she does, not what she says. If she wants you to watch a movie with her, but falls asleep on your shoulder within minutes, what she really wants is for you to cuddle her snug - the feeling is more important than the end result. Use stuff like this to tease her and build up the sex factor. 17) Men have a nothing box - their own inbuilt man cave. Women have an everything box, which is why they're always thinking about the house, you, kids, friends, etc. getting overwhelmed and thinking men are lazy and have no vision. And if you don't talk, she'll assume every other reason in the world except the fact that you don't have anything to talk about. If you need her to get aroused by you, you have to get her out that box first. Note : The everything box is what often kills her sex drive in an LTR, because women don't master it. They prioritize poorly, spend the day thinking about all the stuff that causes stress and kills arousal (i.e. everything else other than her man and her attraction to him), and usually keep at it till they get too overwhelmed. It's a bad habit. To understand this as a man, try getting an erection thinking of bills, dirty laundry and dishes. You can't. 18) Never depend on her money, her car, her whatever. You're a man. Have wealth of your own. Have a vision and style for everything, EVERYTHING. Your pride exists for a reason, wear it like armor. 19) Subtle is powerful. E.g. A few seconds of silence and a mere look can communicate emotion more powerfully than going overboard like a child. 20) Women strongly feel for the man they want, but cannot have. Love in separation and obstructed love is a staple of romance stories. Familiarity breeds contempt. 21) Cheating is addictive. Once a cheater, always a cheater. If she cheats once, she's done it before in her teens and 20s and will do it again. We can all control our minds, but our brains evolved for hard times, to treat pleasure like sugar (i.e. very scarce) - the kind of easy dopamine rush we get today is truly unprecedented. Pleasure addiction is the mental analogue of obesity. It's sweet poison. 22) If you hear the words 'Open relationship', it's over and you're the beta. Get out. This is an artifact made possible by contraception. Women are only polygamous briefly for alpha seed and in their fantasies, at all other times they're hypergamous. (Hilariously, she'll totally lose her mind if you actually follow through and bring the competition home). 23) Do not chase an ex who got disgusted by you. Women might not love you forever, but they can stop loving you for good. There is actually an event horizon as far as loss of attraction goes. 24) Low trust and pleasure addiction in a society are signs of the end times. 25) DO NOT get into an LTR/marriage to a woman with Borderline Personality Disorder! Run for the hills if you see 'em. They're crazy extremists with no limiters whatsoever - a force of destruction. It's the one thing a man must actually fear. 26) Attraction is a very pure instinct (not morally, but in functioning). Stuff like the mundanities of life will kill it. Don't believe the media BS. Dirty laundry and snoring is not sexy. Comfort is not aroused. Sex is pure - pure sexy. 27) A married woman's love is divided between you and many other things on her mind, especially the kids. That wasn't the case when you were pure alpha and she purely desired you. So get her out of that everything box if you want the old flames back. Men can easily separate the sex from the other stuff, women are not so good at it. 28) Women always blame men and the world as a first instinct. In a giant extension of the sexual principle, women feel that the world is acting on them, while idealistic men want to change the world. The greatest pressure, hate and jealousy on women however, come from other women (and incels). 29) You must stand up for what's right even if it means disappointing and frustrating her. Always trying to please her and go her way is a huge mistake, especially when she's testing you and her subconscious wants you to hold up your frame and stand up to her -- for this your frame, your view of reality should be very clear. It also keeps you just out of her reach. Yes, pleasing isn't everything. Women like to feel all the emotions - almost as if life is a big movie for them. 30)Women love to fight for play and drama, just like their favourite animal, the cat. It's a shit test. Meow. 31) Testing never ends. Just like you never get tired of the urge to touch her. The nature of the tests will change as needs change over time. 32) Last but not the least - man is the gatekeeper of commitment. Sex is a need and therefore also a weakness. Freedom however IS power. After your energy and time, your freedom is your most precious resource. Respect it. 33) Respect is EVERYTHING to a man. And Frame. This was from another thread, which the OP took down (I intended to write 5 points and ended up with this wall of text). Yes I got the idea of the nothing box from Patrice O'Neal, but it made me realize the existence of the everything box in women. Suddenly a lot of things made sense. The book : Practical Female Psychology for the Practical Man, is available here. You don't need it to get a woman, but if you're considering LTR and marriage you'll need it. URL"

It is your duty as a man to lead and know the direction youre going (if its not on an upward trajectory then you fucked up bad) Aim that load upwards fellas. If you cannot lead then youre a disappointment to society and those around you and importantly to yourself as youll have to deal with being a loser. There is enough losers as is.

Fact is most people are simply not smart enough to do so but this does not mean you cannot impose your desires onto the world. You are being battered by the more chaotic and disorganized cultures of minorities and foreigners. The response is to dig in to your views as a rallying, identifying, and unifying point. You simply parrot what you've heard from your media selected authorities. This is a result of whites being the most indoctrinated/educated and i would say the most soulless. Whites are too rigid to be able to withstand the relatively chaotic nature of the other.

27,vulnerability,TheRedPill,"Building Strengths, While Minimizing Weaknesses",4,8cloed,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/8cloed/building_strengths_while_minimizing_weaknesses/,2018-04-16 17:00:06,"The following is an excerpt from the script of my next Video featuring Illimitable Man's monk mode concept. *** ""Concept Four : Building Strengths, While Minimizing Weaknesses."" That phrase is the easiest concept to understand, and in my opinion the most important when it comes to monk mode, yet it's surrounded by plenty of confusion - so let's clarify it right now: **When someone tells you to Build strengths, it means two things:** - First, you need to get better at what you're good at, good at what you're okay at, and so on. If you're a great writer, become an award winning novelist. If you're completely out of shape, be able to bench press a little more than your body weight. If you're a great painter, get your work into galleries. If you're a lousy cook, develop one dish that's orgasmic. Picture yourself in a suit of armor. You want to develop and show off the strongest most impenetrable sections of it, while ensuring the rest of you is at the very least, up to par, because you're only as strong as your weakest link. The idea behind this, is you're gonna wanna focus MOST of your energy on pursuits you have a natural affinity for - and your remaining energy on improving things you suck at. This is known as the pareto principal, the 80/20 - 80 percent of your results come from 20 percent of your actions. Lets say you have five hobbies, painting, writing, running, bike racing, and skydiving. All of these are fun, make you more interesting, but you happen to be really good at running - you got long legs, lungs stronger Usian's bolts... Running is the 20%, and it will bring you 80% of your life's results, a healthy body, a strong group of athletic friends, access to high status events and potential to win universally recognized accolades, and tons of bitches, all of which you never would have had the potential for in your other amaetur hobbies... However, before you can reach those heights of greatness that comes to having a formidable strength you must understand the second meaning of the phrase ""Building Strengths..."" - Two : YOU MUST PUT YOURSELF INTO POSITIONS TO DEMONSTRATE YOUR STRENGTHS! What good is it to be an amazing juggler if you never show anyone you can throw 17 burning knives between your hands blindfolded? Sounds impressive and amazing as fuck, but nobody gives a fuck about what they can't see! Pics or it didnt happen bro! It is critical for your development as a victorious man, to demonstrate your skills and strengths through victory in competition and battle. **This is the only way for you to gain true confidence**, and feel that you are a master of your craft, hobby, or pursuit. As you put yourself out into the world, you will find challengers who emerge from the woodworks, almost from thin air, as the universe itself were testing your abilities - okay I got carried away there but that's the way this actually feels like. If you've only ever light-spared, you will never know how you will handle an all out fight, and I guarantee you will panic or at the very least be stressed out. There is a difference between practice and the real thing. The only way you can honestly tell yourself that you have a strength is if you put it to the test, and win. We ain't out here trying to build skills that we keep as hidden secrets, talkin all that *""as long as I know I'm good, that's all that matters""* bullshit - that's some beta male bitch shit, put yourself out there. We here to WIN nigga. Fuck. **Another great way to ensure victory is by Minimizing weaknesses.** Like I said earlier, show off the best parts of your armor, and improve your weaker links, because you are only as strong as your weakest links. If you suck at something, work on it until you are somewhat competent and decent at it to handle yourself in the very basics of a situation to solve that problem. - If you're bad at something, work on it until you're atleast okay at it. If you don't know a damn thing about cars, AT THE ABSOLUTE VERY LEAST have a company on file you can call to help you out if you blow out a tire. Now you're not COMPLETELY clueless, you minimized that weakness. Don't know how to do laundry? Cant be bothered with learning? Hire a maid. There are multiple solutions to a problem to achieve the desired outcome. Not every man is capable of lugging 300LB boxes back and forth for hours on end - so some guy invented a push cart. He minimized his weakness in physical fortitude by building and emphasizing his strength in cleverness. However, do not mistake this for foolish vulnerability. There is nothing noble about exposing yourself. You will gain nothing. - REMOVE YOURSELF FROM SITUATION WHERE YOUR WEAKNESSES ARE EXPOSED! You don't go around flashing your weakest links to your enemies do you? Why would you, unless you're looking to get killed! If you are absolute shit with coding and programming, DO NOT ENTER an all night hack-a-thon contest. If you can't draw, don't volunteer to make someone's banner or t-shirt design. If you can't fight, don't go looking for one! If you aren't strong, dont try to ego lift 500 LB and kill yourself! If you can't shoot, don't become a cop! If you can't talk with people, don't become a salesman! IF YOU CANT SING, DO NOT AUDITION FOR AMERICA'S GOT TALENT. YOU WILL END UP ONE OF THE FOOLS I WATCH AND LAUGH! All of that will lead to unneeded, and unhelpful embarrassment and failure. Serious, only a masochist would do this. *** Both aspects of the concept, of building strengths while minimizing weaknesses, are built on the foundation of the following premise: ""BE THE STRONGEST VERSION OF YOURSELF. BE WHO YOU ARE. DO WHAT YOU'RE GOOD AT."" Arnold couldn't have Nietzsche's literary genius, and Nietzsche couldn't reach Arnie's physique even if he tried. As much as you can reprogram your mentality and belief systems, you could even spend years developing a talent that you initially sucked at, but you must also understand you have a genetic predisposition, and should not become deluded and try to become that which you are not. You will probably never look like Arnie, but I'm sure there's SOMETHING you can do that Arnie wouldn't have the slightest chance at mastering. Imagine, John and I are both painters competing for the same gallery spot, where as it took John 10 years to get as good as I am in my first year painting. And 1 year goes by, and I'm already leagues better than John again. What a waste of time. Picture the suburban white kid trying to act hood, who goes into the actual hood and gets robbed. Don't let that be you. *** ^Some ^quick ^disclaimers ^for ^any ^autists ^who ^might ^be ^out ^there ^- ^All ^men ^are ^meant ^to ^lift ^heavy ^shit. ^I've ^seen ^guys ^without ^legs ^who ^are ^stronger ^than ^most ^college ^kids. ^Being ^strong ^is ^a ^male ^STRENGTH. ^Some ^guys ^are ^just ^stronger ^than ^others. ^Seduction ^is ^not ^a ^weakness ^that ^you ^must ^hide ^either, ^it ^is ^a ^strength ^that ^must ^be ^built, ^just ^like ^your ^body. ^Pick ^up ^is ^encoded ^into ^our ^DNA, ^every ^single ^one ^of ^us ^are ^here ^as ^a ^result ^of ^one ^of ^our ^ancestors ^busting ^a ^fat ^nut ^in ^some ^hoes ^butt.

28,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Self Compassion: Become Your Best,2,8dcdf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/8dcdf9/self_compassion_become_your_best/,2018-04-19 15:32:02,"Today we are going to talk about the concept of Self Compassion, which is rarely ever talked about here in TheRedPill. No, this is not some hippy ""hold hands because all need to love each other"" type of blue pill pop psychology. Having high self-compassion is critical to have personal transformations and to ascend to alphadom. You will have an understanding of why bluepill thinking discourages self compassion, and how having high self compassion can prevent ""mental malware"" like oneitis and performance anxiety. ##""With self-compassion, we give ourselves the same kindness and care we'd give to a good friend."" - Kristen Neff #What Is Self Compassion? Self Compassion means that you have love for yourself. Self Compassion consists of three parts; self-kindness, common humanity and mindfulness. The term was coined by Kristen Neff in her bestselling book ""Self Compassion : The Proven Power of Being Kind to Yourself."" When you have high self compassion you are more charismatic, confident, and walk the world with a great sense of purpose. Many sociologists have similiar terms for semf compassion: Sociologist| Definition of Self Compassion ---|--- Carl Rogers| ""unconditional positive regard"" Albert Ellis | ""unconditional self-acceptance"" Maryhelen Snyder's | ""internal empathizer"" Ann Weiser Cornell| ""gentle, allowing relationship"" Judith Jordan | ""concept of self-empathy"" To be your best self, you need too have high self-kindness, a sense of common humanity, and a high level of mindfulness. All three combined form Self Compassion. Below I have summarrized to best of my ability the three parts of self compassion: The Three Parts of Self-Compassion | Summary |Wikipedia Definition [Self Compassion](URL -----|---|--- Self-kindness |**Love yourself aways.** | ""Being warm towards oneself when encountering pain and personal shortcomings, rather than ignoring them or hurting oneself with self-criticism. Having a positive inner voice"" Common humanity |**Nobody is Perfect** |""Recognizing that suffering and personal failure is part of the shared human experience."" Mindfulness | **Express Your Emotions**|""Taking a balanced approach to one's negative emotions so that feelings are neither suppressed nor exaggerated. Negative thoughts and emotions are observed with openness, so that they are held in mindful awareness. Mindfulness is a non-judgmental, receptive mind state in which individuals observe their thoughts and feelings as they are, without trying to suppress or deny them."" #TheRedPill teachings and Self Compassion ##""The Redpill encourages the increase of self compassion, while the Blue Pill encourages the decrease of self compassion."" | Compassion Levels |Defininition ---|--- Low Self Compassion (Bluepill) | Others needs and feelings are higher priority than my own needs. My inner voice is negative and I am a failure. Expressing emotions is weak and unmanly. High Self Compassion ( Redpill)| My needs are feelings are higher priority than other peoples needs. My inner voice is full of optimism and saysI am good enough. Showing my emotions is healthy. #How Do I Know My Self Compassion Levels? It's actually very easy to find out by taking a Self Compassion Scale that asks 25 questions. You can take the Scale [here](URL . (links to URL #The Benefits of High Self Compassion Okay, but what are the benefits of high Self Compassion? Self Compassion Parts| The Benefits ---|--- High Self-Kindness | Positive inner voice that encourages accomplishments and optimism. High Self-kindness increases personal boundries and gives you a healthy DGAF attitude. It also reduces narcissism because you have genuine confidence in yourself and don't feel like an imposter who needs validation all the time. Your confidence comes from your self love. High Common humanity | Have a ""good enough"" mentality prevents performance anxiety because it eliminates perfectionism.It increases your flow and focus because you don't have a fear of failure. Also you have the realization that asking for help and showing vulnerability is alright. Shields you from a fear of failure. High Mindfullness | The main benefit is having a stronger frame and more stable emotions. You have the realization that you don't have to be happy all the time and that its appropriate to express anger and sadness. It's also a vaccination against Oneitis because you can have passions for many different things and the source of your happiness doesn't come from a woman. The happiness comes from you, like a solar panel collecting sunlight. Other benefits also include: Higher Chance of |-----| Lower Chance Of ---|---|--- life satisfaction |-----| self-criticism wisdom|-----| depression happiness|-----| anxiety optimism|-----| rumination (bad thoughts) curiosity|-----|thought suppression learning goals|-----| perfectionism social connectedness |----|disordered eating personal responsibility |-----| needing validation In TheRedPill, the teaching of how to become an Alpha also correlate with an increase in Self Compassion. In other words, by increasing self compassion you actually develop more Alpha like qualities. Below are some way to improve self compassion. Self Compassion Part | How to Improve it the TRP Way ---|--- Self-Kindness | Lift Weights and take care of your nutrition to give your body encouragement. Your needs come first, and have DGAF mentality. Aesthetics and getting muscles will improve your life. Love yourself. Common humanity | Approach women, and realize that rejection is better than regret. No one is perfect and we are all going to make it. Practise your social skills on strangers to discover that all of us have problems and no one is perfect. A high common humality can lead to increases in Status and Game. It's okay to have approach anxiety, everyone does. Mindfulness | Meditate. Practice having a strong frame of reality by doing self reflection. Do Monk Mode for focus and realize that its okay to show your whole spectrum of emotions. #BluePill encourages Low Self Compassion The problem with the bluepill model of thinking is that it is encouraged for men to have low self-compassion. Low self compassion is encouraged in an environment of the mediocre and female worship. Self Compassion Part | Ways BluePill Discourages It ---|--- Self-Kindless | Bluepill discourages self-kindless by shaming men who don't want to please women. Bluepill thinking believes that a man's kindness should be used to please the needs of his girlfriend or mother. His mission in life is to find his soulmate and support her forever. His needs are low priority and he is shamed if he wants to lead a bachelor life or buy a sports car. Common humanity| Bluepill encourages men to isolate themselves instead of seeking help from others. The act of showing vulnerability is shamed by using phrases like ""Man UP"". Blue pill encourages men to toughen up and to have a harsh inner critic that is very negative. Men are disposable, so if they are failures its normal. Talking about problems is very unmanly, just suck it up. Mindfulness| Bluepill encourages men to repress emotions and feelings. This is an unhealthy habit because the repression of emotions is on the top of the list for the main causes of Oneitis and People Pleaser Syndrome. For others repressing emotions is a very numb experience, almost autistic in nature. #Self, The Operating System of You The book Psycho-Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltrz pioneered the concept of the Self Image which is the idea one has of one's abilities, appearance, and personality. Having high self compassion is like an upgrade to the way one thinks of ourselves. It's like adding a turbo charger to a car or a new graphics card to a computer. The mind is like an operating system of a computer, and follows an ""if this, then that"" type of programming. **IF** you have happy thoughts, **then** that causes an increase of confidence. Just like a computer your mind can be infected by ""mental malware"" that is a virus that hijacks your way of thinking. Having high self compassion is an antivirus to this ""mental malware"". Mental Malware | Main Cause | How Self-Compassion Prevents It ---|---| --- Oneitis |Low Self Kindness | Having high self compassion prevents oneitis because you train yourself to take care of your own needs first. Having high self love encorages a worldview were you don't need the validation of another person to feel satisfied. You can leave the friendzone if she says no because you have the confidence to try again with another girl. Performance Anxiety| Low Common humanity | Realizing that everyone makes mistakes and that you tried your best prevents perfectionism. You are happy to take risks because you know failure is alright. Common humanity has revealed to you that no one operates at 100% at all times. Weak Frame | Low Mindfulness | You don't let others influence or control your emotions. It's alright to express ""bad"" emotions and you don't feel pressured to always be happy or joyful. People Pleaser | Low Self Kindness | Having a encouraging or motivating inner voice prevents you from adopting the idea that you need to keep others happy. Your high self kindness motivates you to have a standard that compares you to yourself; not others. Empathy is a my privilege, not a right. If they get mad it is not your problem. Social Anxiety| Low Common humanity | You realize that nobody is perfect and we all have problems.Common humanity is proof that everyone strikes out in the mating game. Getting rejected by a girl is normal human behavior and it doesn't mean there is nothing wrong with you. Stress Rollercoaster |Low Mindfulness| You realize that only you can influence your emotions, and if you are stressed you have the ability to calm your mind. By having high Mindfulness you realize that your frame of reality is stronger than hers. Atlas Personality|Low Self Kindness| Having an Atlas personality means that you feel you have to take care of other people's problems, and their stresses and problems are on your shoulders. An Atlas personality results in a life that is devoid of fun and you seem to be solving people's problem. Having high self kindness prevents an atlas personality because you realize that the only problems that needs solving are yours; and possibly your immediate family. Narcissistic Abuse| Low Common humanity| Narcissistic abuse is when someone constantly belittles you and makes you feel worthless. Having high Common humanity prevents this because you recognize that you just because someone calls you a failure or a loser doesn't mean its true. Codependency| Low Mindfulness| Codependency is an excessive emotional or psychological reliance on a partner. Having high mindfulness prevents codependency because you realize that you are only responsible for your own feelings and emotions.

29,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Benjamin Sledge and his opinion on the fatherless generation,82,8h00y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/8h00y7/benjamin_sledge_and_his_opinion_on_the_fatherless/,2018-05-05 01:19:15,"I dont have the group picture from the day my dad visited my fraternity house at Oklahoma State University. It was awkward compared to the Moms Day photo we would snap a few months later. Not that its awkward to take pictures with my dad  were all smiles  but the Dads Day photo, which hung above my fraternity brothers desk, along with a compilation of date party photos, looked anything but natural. Each year, the university invites parents to spend a day with their kids. Most of us eat at one of the iconic Eskimo Joes restaurants, tailgate, and then head to a football game. Afterward, its off to the bars, or whatever late night event your parent can muster the energy for. Outside fraternity and sorority houses, youll find co-eds posing for group photos with dear old mom or dad. The photos with the moms always turn out great. There we are, hugging mom or kissing her face. Everyones laughing and appears to be having a great time. If your mom made it out to the bar for a drink, like mine did, youd introduce her to the girl you were interested in while acting part of the perfect gentlemen. Then youd meet the mother of said-girl and your moms would screech about what a cute couple the two of you would make. Dads were different. Like Saturn versus Earth different. The group photos always seemed cold. There were some hugs happening, but they were those weird side hugs that Christians seem so fond of giving one another  the keep some room for the Holy Spirit variety. Everyone looks like a stoic philosopher; the smiles seem somewhat forced. When the dads came to the bar, they either became Frank the Tank or scanned the room like the Terminator. Most guys never introduced their dad to the girl they were interested in, either. Unlike my mom, my dad and I grabbed dinner and caught up before he had to leave. He had work the next day. Ive long wondered why the two photos turned out so opposite. Why did we suddenly look like mamas boys when we so often tried to be the man? Why such a lack of intimacy with our fathers (and even our friends) when we seemed to be OK with it from our mothers? Whered You Learn to Be a Man? The memory of the Dads Day picture has been nagging me, so I start questioning other men and my friends. At first my question was too complex: Who did you learn emotional intimacy from? Or do you feel you have any intimacy with male friends? Some guys laughed. Other stared and responded with something like, WTF does that mean? So I changed my question: Did your dad ever teach you how to be a man? The responses Ive received range from learning how to change a tire or the oil in a car, or learning how to tie a tie. This made me think, if this is what qualifies as masculinity, were in deep shit. So I dug further. Did your dad ever talk to you about the mistakes he made in life? Was he vulnerable? Did he teach you how to date or romance a woman? How to pick healthy friends? Did he talk about sex, porn, or masturbation? Its fascinating that in Judeo-Christian literature theres an entire book of the Bible dedicated to teaching a son about money, friends, sex, adultery, making wise decisions, marriage, and business  the book of Proverbs, in case youre wondering  but in America, the resounding answer I heard from men was, No, my dad didnt talk about those things. If a father did talk about those issues, then it was usually one of those, This is how sex works good talk, moments. But because we live in what I call a fatherless generation, Dad wasnt often in the picture to begin with. So where did we learn to become men? The Influence of the Alpha Male Most everyone whos read Lord of the Flies remembers how a group of boys descend into barbarity, and can easily recall the moment where Piggy gets his brains smashed in. For most boys, growing up these days isnt all that dissimilar. With no one teaching young men virtue, character, or responsibility, the alpha male emerges thinking he has some semblance of how the world works, and so the other boys follow his lead. Sometimes the alpha male lands that leadership position because hes mimicking problematic behavior thats been demonstrated by a shitty father figure at home, which his friends may consider cool, since they dont have positive male representation around them. Dad shows him porn, so he shows it to his friends, who then learn early on to objectify women. Dad talks about sports all the time and can tell you where every player on the Patriots played junior varsity football, so his alpha son gets his friends into sports and berates them for not having an encyclopedic knowledge. Dad talks about women with misogynistic overtones, so he and his friends mimic him and begin to talk that way too. Dad reminds his son that real men dont cry. Real men act tough all the time. Real men get angry when insulted. Real men dont show their emotions. Photos like this are great, but sadly, most men would wonder if theyre gay instead just of friends | Photo by Derek Owens on Unsplash It doesnt all come down to just one alphas influence, though. Many of these behaviors and ideas permeate young boys minds through things theyve seen or heard in the media and online. The wolves teach the wolf pups how to become wolves. But we dont run in packs anymore. We prefer to lone wolf it. Or if we do run in a pack, we never display weakness for fear well be turned on and devoured. Its a lonely world when you dont have friends you can have deep conversations with. Its much more common to find yourself in male friendships where you cant express your angst or pain without fear of being labeled a pussy. Theres no camaraderie. Aside from guys you grab drinks with after work or go to a sporting event with, the extent of your relationship is superficial. When you dont know how to manage your emotions, you wont know how to handle rejection, dating, fear, loneliness, or sadness  let alone anything else. Virtues like character, loyalty, love, humility, courage, and vulnerability are replaced with vices like anger, jealousy, vanity, and pride. While men desperately crave emotional intimacy with other men, some of us have built up callouses so tough that even the notion of deep connection is considered effeminate. Instead, men lash out with deadly violence and dive head first into asynchronistic digital intimacy as opposed to real relationships. Getting Bombed in Austin and the Porn Patch Every man can tell how many goats or sheep he possesses, but not how many friends.  Marcus Tullius Cicero When the package bombings that rocked Austin, Texas, made the news this past March, friends called to check and see if I was anywhere near the explosions. Once they learned I was fine, they asked if the bombings carried the markings of someone with military expertise, due to my combat experience. All around Austin, fear ran rampant as rumors were passed as fact. Neighbors informed me that our area of town should expect to be hit next. I laughed at their misinformed panic, fueled by the fact that we love to believe what we want to hear  provided it lines up with what we already assume. When I explained that the Austin bombings carried the mark of an amateur who probably learned from YouTube, the dark web, or a jihadi website, people then asked about motive. While everyone still seems to be searching for it  since bomber Mark Anthony Conditts confession video didnt offer any definitive explanation  I think its right in front of our faces. The statement made about Conditts confession video by Austin police Chief Brian Manley explained that this was the outcry of a very challenged young man talking about challenges in his personal life that led him to this point. People were caught up in semantics after Manleys statement, wanting to know whether the bomber was a terrorist or whether his motive was racially-based, since two of the victims were prominent members of Austins black community. I think the more simple truth is  like other men in our generation  Conditt was lonely, isolated, and bought into the view that men express anger and hurt through violence. As I stated in another piece, were dealing with a generation that no longer has the skills necessary to cope with hardship and adversity. People are chronically lonely even though theyre more connected than ever. Notice there are zero media reports in which they interview Conditts friends or past girlfriends, even. The only people in the interviews are old acquaintances from school or church. And dont hold up the penalty card as if his dad provided sufficient care because he was raised in a religious home. Many times, religious homes can be the most emotionally vacant place for a young man. Austin bomber Mark Anthony Conditt One thing I feel would confirm my suspicions about the Austin bomber is whether he regularly consumed porn. Hear me out: Since we have no reports on friends or past girlfriends, one thing most lonely men do is watch porn. Just get on 4Chan or a similar site and the chatter often revolves around porn while simultaneously making fun of themselves for living in their parents basements. Its an easy patch for the lack of emotional intimacy they crave with a real human. Cant get a date? Theres porn for that. Dont know how to talk to a woman? Theres porn for that. Get rejected when you ask a girl out? Theres porn for that. In my line of work, I counsel a lot of young men through porn addiction. They always come in thinking porn is the issue, but its always symptomatic of something much deeper. Out of each man Ive counseled, Ive discovered that they all lacked emotional intimacy with their dad growing up. While that may sound ludicrous, consider this excerpt from Dr. Joshua Straubs book Safe House. A team of researchers at the John Hopkins School of Medicine set out on a 30-year study to find if a single related cause existed for five major issues: mental illness, hypertension, malignant tumors, coronary heart disease, and suicide. After studying 1,377 students over thirty years, the most prevalent single cause wasnt what everyone thought. They found that the most significant predictor of these tragedies was a lack of closeness to the parents, especially the father. The Warrior Poet Late one evening I stumbled out of a dusty building like a drunk pirate not quite used to walking on land. My head was spinning from the news I had just received. I wanted to vomit and scream all at the same time. The Iraqi base I was stationed at in the middle of Ramadi remained still while the whirl of generators filled the night, my shuffling adding to the noise. Taking another step, I collapsed into the dirt and wept until my tears formed mud on my hands and face. It would be my friend Greg who would find the shell of a man lying on the ground with a muddy, tear-streaked face. Shes leaving. Shes leaving god, shes really leaving, is all I managed to get out while sobs racked my body. Thirty minutes ago Id gotten the devastating news about the end of my relationship back home. Iraq was a hard enough place to deal with anyway, but now the person I loved most was gone. Greg leaned me against his barrel-shaped chest and hugged me while I cried. What he said that night made all the difference. Youre not alone and well get through this together. Many view the military as the epitome or last great bastion of masculinity. Even English writer Samuel Johnson once remarked, Every man thinks meanly of himself for not having been a soldier, or not having been at sea. Each time men learn I served in the military and in combat, I often hear similar sentiments. I wanted to enlist, but have a medical condition/parents wanted me to go to college/[insert reason here]. While many men (but not all) see the military as a mark of masculinity, what they fail to recognize or acknowledge is the deep and emotional bonding that occurs amongst soldiers. Instead they paint us solely as warriors and never poets with deep feelings. Of the men I served with I can tell you about their life stories, fears, victories, relationships, and struggles. Weve cried, hugged, laughed, and shared some of our deepest secrets with one another. Men at war | Photo from Wikipedia While post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) gets lobbed around like a grenade in a china store as an explanation for why soldiers are killing themselves at an endemic rate, I believe the answer is much simpler. Were lonely and lack the emotional intimacy we once had with our brothers in arms. Those who ascribe to the toxic view that men should stifle their emotions are likely unaware of a soldiers capacity to feel deeply  due in large part to the relationships we foster  and their possession of a so-called effeminate side. Oh Fathers, Where Art Thou? The price good men pay for indifference to public affairs is to be ruled by evil men.  Plato, The Republic As a child, I jumped off houses trying to mimic Superman. I microwaved spiders in an attempt to transform into Spiderman. Every stick was a sword. Apples became grenades. Crackers were carefully bitten into the shape of guns as my brother and I carried out invisible cracker wars with our snacks. But I also drew and loved art. I sang in a choir. I played with Barbies. I wrote poetry and stories. There is currently a two pronged assault on young boys. We view roughhousing, playing with toy swords, and fake war as a sign that our boys will become psychopaths because of recent events. Men falsely believe sensitivity and visible displays of emotions are signs of weakness. This leaves a lot of young men growing up confused. We dont engage in the healthy types of play we need to bond, and we dont get the emotional connection we need from fathers or other men. This leaves men apathetic and indifferent when they feel they can be neither, and thus we retreat into our digital worlds of lethargy. Today, many good men sit on the sidelines while evil continues to infect the masculine soul like a cancer. Were not teaching young men virtue or character, but vice. Were telling them, tamp down your feelings, but also dont be too masculine because thats bad. The internal warrior gets crushed, and the poet is labeled a sissy. Im not sure what the answer is to all this, but I know it begins with strong male figures fathering other men. It will take men of integrity who want to change our culture from within, not those who scream from their social media soapbox. Any change that happens will be built on the backs of one-on-one mentoring between men of character and their pupils lost and adrift in todays culture. It will take men of honor. It will take courage in a world that promotes vice. Only then can we create warrior poets."
30,vulnerability,TheRedPill,I got friendzoned and escaped the frienzone and made her fall for me in a single date. Field report.,0,8h25kt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/8h25kt/i_got_friendzoned_and_escaped_the_frienzone_and/,2018-05-05 06:02:37,"First a little about me, then the date and last my toughts. 1. About me: So I didn't know TRP existed when all this happened \(\~5 months ago\). I was just over with my 5 year LTR. Although I discovered TRP 2 months ago I was pseduo\-redpilled about the dating world since 2013 thanks to the book The Tao of Badass. Then I jumped into a LTR with a bonafide paranoid \+ bipolar girl which halted my progress for the next years.. I went into this date with the knowledge that I don't intend anything serious, I wanted to get my feet wet into the dating world and was really outcome independent. Sure getting sex was going to be good but this was not my purpose with the date. I'm 25, tall, with the V\-type body but not ripped. Biggest draw \- weak social skills. In essence I'm above her in looks. She wasn't anything special.. 2. The date: The date was bad. She was totally oblivious and disengaged in/by anything that happened. Usually we talked about her and things she wanted to talk, she showed little ineterest in my until I made her fall for me \(duh I guess?\). First we walked in a park about an hour and talked, I don't even remeber about what.. During this time I tried getting closer physically but didn't get anything. So we went to play snooker. Before the date we have talked and when I have asked her if she plays snooker she said yes and was very enthusiastic. Turns out she haven't played snooker. Only on her phone twice.... I learn this when we go to play as I've planned the date in advance. Fun times! So we are in this gaming club and I teach her snooker. But she's not going with the flow you know.. I ask her about herself \(women love talking about themselves right\) and we play. Nothing special. Then in my attempt to make things interesting I say suggest from now on when one of us makes a point in snooker he can ask the other Truth or Dare. So things get more interesting.. but no! She constantly ""forgets"" to dare me or ask me something. I don't remember what I've asked except 1 important thing which I'll reveal later. So we played and I saved one Truth question for later. It's noteworthy that she wanted to pay for her half which surprised me but I insisted and paid the whole thing. So we go outside and sit on a bench in the centre of the city. Now we are out for atleast 2\+ hours and have talked a lot, but not anything special and not much in a sexual way.. like friends. So basically I push the conversation about kissing and stuff and she comes out with the frienzone shit which I didn't expect really considering I wasn't supplicating to her and was leading her more or less. Felt really bad at that moment but accepted it somehow and with the outcome intependent mindset and conviction I, no longer covertley i.e. outright told her \(using my Truth question\) if she's okay if I go for a kiss and she's like ""ok"". Lolz! So, shaking, I go and kiss her. So we end up talking more and now she started opening up FUCKING FINALLY. Started asking me about myself, what I like etc. We went up and started walking again in the park. For 2 fucking hours \(more\) we walked and talked but this time I'm like \- I don't really give a fuck I'll just squeez as much as I can from this situation. We end up talking about sex and our sexual fantasies. I'm way more bold and detailed in my explanation, really not giving much of a fuck. She giggles and is all red and is like ""stop it please"" but in a fun kind a way. So by the end of the date she finally started asking about my past relationships \(these are important questions!\) and ask me what I think of her and if I believe if she is capable of cheating! WTF obviously I'll say ""no""... She ended up teaching me to dance under the moonlight \(lol..\). Kissed her 2 more times, again I pushed for it. During our conversation I learned her ex cheated on her and she still was with him, she broke it off because something else \(don't remember\). The fact she tolerated cheating is telling a lot about her... So out date is edning \(finally\) and she's hugging me, holding me by the hand etc. And I'm like \- I don't care but always smilling. The fact that I didn't care doesn't mean I was mean. After we parted way, she started texing me for the next 2\-3 months. Always starting the conversation, everytime I weasel myself out of the conversation. Few days pass, she texts again ad infinitum. 3. My thoughts: Well I think the fact I showed that I don't care if I'm friendzoned and still went for a kiss \(somehow?\) opened her up. She is a mess, too much problems. Doesn't know what she wants and is going on autopilot. I believe she acted this way unintentionally. Although I didn't show how hurt I was by the frienzone speech I still showed vulnerability AFTER it, or more specifically honesty. Told her what I like \(about sex\) in a shameless way and everything else \(that outcome independet minset!\). Also when we danced like retards, some other retards was laughing at us briefly and I showed I don't care about them much. I guess that's some points too? So the 2 most important things that got me out of this situation \(i.e not be friendzoned\) are: 1. Outcome independent mindset \(boldness and honesty comes from here\). Being bold is sexy and honesty is not bad I guess. 2. Persistence/not giving up until it's final. Now I could have easily given up when she frienzoned me. Go home, feel sorry for myself etc. But with persistence I got 3 kisses and a dance lesson! Gonna wrap this up as the vodka is over.. Share your thoughs and thanks for reading!"
31,vulnerability,TheRedPill,[FR] A More Socially-Acceptable Version of Redpill theory,238,8i3a9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/8i3a9z/fr_a_more_sociallyacceptable_version_of_redpill/,2018-05-09 14:40:08,"[TL;DR] a version of redpill theory that BP friends/relatives can listen to. One of the most common problems that RP men experiences is having to watch their BP friends &amp; relatives suffer the consequences of their conditioning but cannot do anything because their BP conditioning would shut out any RP speech if they are not ready for the change. Today I just eavesdrop on my master (martial art) speaking to a trainer and I realize his explanation is probably the most socially-acceptable version of RP theory I have heard. I did my best to translate his words (he's Chinese) &gt; There is only one reason for a woman to leave a man- she does not consider him a strong man. Only one thing matters to women- strong men. They need strong men so that they can lean on. When a woman dont see their man as strong, **and they don't know how to motivate their man to become stronger**, it is **the rational thing for them** to leave the man. &gt;Your feeling means something to you, but they dont mean anything to women. Your feelings are there to **tell you** who you are attracted to, they are not **means to attract women**. Only strength means something to women. Telling a woman you love her is like telling yourself you love her- you know it true, but she might as well not have heard it, because your feeling is not what she's drawn to. But when you show strength in your character, the women will automatically understand ""this is a man I can count on"" There are two things I find fascinating about his RP perspective *in his perspective, the main flaw of BP men is thinking that his feelings can be used to attract women. This is a lot more acceptable to a BP than ""dude read the sidebar, then spend time working through the cycles of anger-depression before reaching acceptance."" I mean, this is something we can talk to our BP without triggering them! It's why I love it so much. *Although we agree that one-itis is an obsessive and unhealthy way to look at women, Rollo also said that there are some types of women with whom the chance of having a good LTR is better. While there is no The One, there are Good Ones. What we don't discuss a lot is ""which is good?"" Well we do, but it's more along the line of ""she is not a feminist"" or ""she doesn't push for exclusive relationship""- both I find rather surface-level advice and unrealistic, because we know that feminist women are only political in their head and still suck dicks like any other women, and there are no woman out there who will not push for exclusivity once they find a high-quality men. But my master just casually points out what to notice in a woman- the ability to motivate their men to overcome their weaknesses. &gt; When a woman don't see their man as strong, **and** they don't know how to motivate their men to become stronger. Even the most alpha men out there have their moments of vulnerability, but their relationship does not dissolve, because their women know how to motivate their men to overcome their weakness. In a healthy relationship, presumably this will be love and support, but I admit that I have not known a woman who knows how to motivate in a healthy way. In a toxic relationship, motivation is done through shame and passive-aggressive remarks, which we know well enough. "
32,vulnerability,TheRedPill,AWALT. But maybe to varying degrees?,1,8jbxkd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/8jbxkd/awalt_but_maybe_to_varying_degrees/,2018-05-14 22:43:33,"I understand all women are like that hypergamy is a law of nature. However I've noticed and maybe some of you have noticed to that some women are more hypergamous than others. I bring this up because I had two girlfriends in the past that differed a lot. Now I am a sensitive person. And I do like to have more than physically intimacy with my partner. But before anybody starts calling me a beta or what not I'm a tough dude and I used to fight MMA so I'm not a pussy. I'm just sensitive I found that sharing vulnerabilities sometimes brings people even closer. When I shared the same vulnerability with both girls the reactions were different. With one girl, her attraction to me didnt falter at all. With the other girl, her attraction did falter (although she said my insecurity made me more ""human"") although she said otherwise I knew it did. Im sensitive, remember? So what gives here? Why was one turned off and one wasnt? Could it be varying levels of hypergamy? Trying to understand this.... Maybe you guys have similar ideas too? Thanks fellas. "
33,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Old Lies,93,84sb44,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/84sb44/old_lies/,2018-03-16 13:48:57,"Essay: URL Excerpt: **Lies for Defective Girls** The next lie is that boys can be, &gt;&gt;both tough and fragile, vulnerable and resilient. Being vulnerable doesnt affect your manliness. Ive written a lot about the lie of transvaluation and Vulnerability in the past, but this was really in terms of how women perceive men and require strength and dominance. Another aspect of masculinity that is encoded into womens mental firmware is to seek out men with superior competency. A woman just is, a man must become is the first maxim of a man accepting his Burden of Performance. Part of this masculine competency involves strength, know-how and determination; all things that have been replaced with feminine-primary emotionalism and naval gazing for boys. Men are expected to know how to do everything and what they do not know, what they are not competent in is one criteria of how they are judged by women. A lot of guys might think, So the fuck what? I dont base my self-worth on the opinions of women. As well you shouldnt, but it doesnt change the truth that if you dont know how to change a tire when you get flat, or you need another man who does know how to do it to change it for you, a woman sees you as less competent  and by extension less capable of providing her with the security she needs from a masculine ideal. Women evolved to see men as a Jack of all trades, master of some. A mans vulnerability (taught to him as a child by his female-primary teachers) most definitely affects his manliness. Vulnerability is, by definition, a weakness. It is a flaw in the design, a chink in the armor and vulnerabilities will be exploited by enemies and rivals to ensure that man fails while a stronger one succeeds in all things. This is Darwinism so simple that to question it seems illogical, but in our equalist utopia toughness and fragility find no contradiction; vulnerability and resilience are bed partners. Again, we must consider that this illogical balance can only exist in the female good human template and the idea that everything is learned and nothing is innate about male and female humans. Promoting the idea that vulnerability doesnt affect manliness presumes that the person declaring it is in some way an authority on a manliness that has been already demonized and conditioned out of our boys today. They hate the very idea that a boy might act in accordance with an inborn masculine proclivity. They hate the idea that a boy might learn to be tough and resilient at the expense of a vulnerability (weakness) because it contradicts the equalist belief set. They hate the idea that boys and girls have innately, biologically, different ways of dealing with emotions that dont align with their belief in a blank-slate. To force them to accept this would be to force them to abandon deeply ego-invested beliefs that they themselves had conditioned into them by the same feminine-primary education. Boys dont naturally emote like girls, but when they refuse to align with the female-correct way of emoting we say that some patriarchal macho man, somewhere, in some movie, in some song, in some household taught that kid not to feel. He somehow learned that allowing his emotions to rule over him, to be vulnerable, to prioritize his feelings above his sense of rational self is what it actually is  a weakness that in our evolutionary past was far likelier to get him killed than to earn the praise of his equalist teachers. Boys are simply not as emotional as girls  our brains did not evolve that way  but because we value the feminine above the masculine today we say this kid is doing it wrong. We say he learned to be an asshole from his macho dad or he learned to love firearms because of the latest rap song or a toxically masculine society that doesnt exist. A kid like Nikolas Cruz was bound to happen in a world that teaches boys to prioritize feelings above rationality. He was taught like a defective girl. He never learned the masculine inspired discipline, determination and resiliency because all that conflicts with the lie that vulnerability is ever a strength. All that conflicts with his feminine-primary upbringing. As such, these defective girls are unequipped to handle the rejection of a girlfriend. The participation trophy generation, the one where everyones a winner and no one ever has to deal with defeat, never teaches these defective girls what to do when they finally do taste a bitter defeat. They never learned how to come back from it because that would mean admitting that vulnerability and emotionalism (the female-correct way to handle it) are in fact weaknesses. So, predictably, a defective girl like Nikolas Cruz does what any petulant teenage girl would  he has an emotional outburst. Only his outburst consists of gunning down 17 kids with an assault rifle. The answer to incidents like this doesnt lie in gun control or further feminization of boys. It lies in reimagining how we educate boys and how we see masculinity as a net positive that can deter exactly this kind of emotional outburst. If you truly want these shootings to stop its time we embrace real men teaching real toughness and resilience in our boys. Its time we teach boys like they will become tough, strong, invulnerable young men we may need to provide future generations with a much needed security. And the time where well need them is coming faster than anyone today really thinks."
34,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Woman's Power,64,7u3570,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7u3570/womans_power/,2018-01-31 05:33:01,"Woman's power is fear. Men's power is strength. She is vulnerable and always feels it. Her body is not designed to fight or to impose. It is designed to carry life into the next generation. Because of that essential task, she naturally values herself highly and understands implicitly that she does not possess enough force to defend herself. That is why women are higher in trait neuroticism. They see fear and anxiety as wisdom. If you let them, they will convince you of the same. When on that plane, women is superior. If you play into her games, she can make you anxious about losing things (her, your status, your job, etc.). Once that anxiety is present, it becomes a vulnerability that puts you on her level. You are now ""equal"", and for a while that makes her comfortable. Seeing fear in you justifies her own fear. And it gets her what she wants. Cortisol and testosterone are inversely proportional. When you become fearful, you become afraid of your own masculinity. Fear engenders fear and prevents its dissolution. The snake is eating its own tail. This is the reality of a beta provider - woman has convinced him to be scared. She has convinced him that life is to precious to risk living it. To be a real man, be not afraid. Everything flows out from that point. Fear is the difference between the Red Pill and MGTOW. "
35,vulnerability,TheRedPill,I Got Cheated On and Dumped by My LTR of 4 Years: TRP Lessons,319,7uw2ti,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7uw2ti/i_got_cheated_on_and_dumped_by_my_ltr_of_4_years/,2018-02-03 11:55:54,"**Summary:** I displayed beta blue pill behavior during my recent 4 year relationship. I have learned some lessons with the help of The Red Pill. *** **Body:** **Before I Loved Her** I (29M) dated my ex (24F) for 4 years. Before I met her, I was angry and in pain. I'd never felt love. I was self-destructive and expected a violent death before 30. During the first 4 months of my relationship, she was just a chick I was fucking. I thought about dumping her to move back home across the country. But she started hinting she wanted to hear me say the words ""I love you."" Id never said it to a girl before. I thought, well, its 4 months in and there are no problems. I like being with her. Shes attractive. I ""should"" love her. At first, it was just words. But slowly, those words turned into a feeling. **After I Loved Her** Gradually, I found myself experiencing intense euphoria thinking and feeling things I'd never thought or felt before. I felt happiness. I felt a concern for my future. I thought for the first time that I was going to marry someone, have children, and buy a home. I felt empathy for strangers. I felt a connection to society, the world, and the universe. I experienced beauty in everyday life. I enjoyed all these feelings. I attributed these feelings to her. So I kept going. I have few friends and family, so I never received outside opinions about my relationship as it progressed. I depended on my intuition (ego?). I assumed that what I was thinking and feeling was what she was thinking and feeling. 6 months together I agreed to buy a dog. 1 year together I invited her to move into my apartment. 2 years in and Im deep in love. Kaleidoscopic fractals. I taught that bitch how to drive. She almost killed us multiple times and ended up wrecking my car. I helped her get jobs by improving her interview skills and resume. I helped her get an education by writing her scholarship essays and tutoring her to pass entrance tests. I provided a positive and supportive counterbalance to her negative self-image and low self-esteem. I always encouraged her to do well for herself in life and in her career. And most importantly, or so I thought, I never cheated on her. I forced my sexuality to be monogamous. The first few years I fought with my constant desire to fuck other women. I overcame this by telling myself I had something good here, and the only way this thing could ever fuck up is if I fucked it up by cheating. I mentally wrestled my sexuality into an expression of my love for her and it stuck. **Red Flags** There were red flags. 2 years in I caught her send a Facebook message to a coworker telling him he's cute. I caught her using the Whisper app secretly. I caught her texting another guy. One night while she was sleeping, I saw she got a text from a person saved under a family name. The message said ""are you still with him?"" I saved the number and I called it. A man answered. I confronted her. I told her to call him in front of me and say ""my boyfriend is gone"" while I listened. The conversation was tame. He didnt flirt. He didnt tell her to come over or refer to any prior meetings. He took no initiative in the conversation. My ex asked all the questions. He sounded confused about her calling. I forget her explanation now about how she knew him. I suspected nothing. Then she started talking about moving out. I got spooked she was going to leave me. So I started running day game to prepare for her exit. I walked around malls, department stores and grocery stores and flirted with girls which boosted my confidence and I got a lot of numbers. I always deleted the number. A few girls were very attractive and I found my thoughts turning to ""Dont delete that fucking number. Buy a disposable phone."" The fucked up thing is that the lesson I derived from it at the time was I had to choose my partner every day even when its tough. I had the choice to be with these girls, but I felt I wanted to be with my ex. **Getting Dumped #1** After 3.5 years she dumped me. She told me she didnt love me. She told me she was unattracted to me. She told me she didnt see a future with me. She packed up her things and moved out within a few hours. I was devastated. For two weeks we shared the dog. She'd come over to pick the dog up. Then she'd drop it off. One time, she asked to come in. She told me shes not seeing anyone. She told me to kiss her. I refused. She walked out. Then she came back. Then she hugged me. Then she started crying. Then she started talking. Then I started talking. Then our clothes came off. And just like that, we were back together. We were back together 6 months. I worked on myself. I got sober (still am). Began lifting every day (still am). Stuck to a healthy diet. Im 5'11 and got myself up to 200 lbs of lean from 185. She changed a little. She communicated more, mostly about how shes attracted to other guys. My attitude was to fight for the relationship. I didnt want to give up what I had back in the beginning. **Getting Dumped #2** Then she dumped me again. This time, she told me she began cheating on me 7 months into our relationship. She tells me its the guy I made her call in front of me. She tells me she fucked him 4 times. The first time I was out of town at a wedding. I remember we sent nudes to each other during that trip. The last time she says it happened I was out of town participating in a family rehab program for my heroin addicted little brother. I remember we had virtual sex over Skype during that trip. That was 3 months ago. I really couldnt focus on anything else. The pain was so loud. Knowing she dumped me so heartlessly. Knowing she dumped me for a coworker. Knowing she cheated on me through my entire experience of becoming a good person because of my relationship with her. Knowing she told me specifically to hurt me. It hurt more than watching my dad die from cancer when I was 15. It hurt more than losing my brother to heroin last year. My fucking soul shrank, splintered, and fragmented. I half expected her to leave but I didnt expect it to hurt this much. **Revenge** I needed to hurt her. I publically shamed her by sending messages to everyone I met through her. Her family, friends, coworkers, orbiters. I sent messages to people I didnt know but I knew knew her. I sent 80+ messages to people telling them that she told me she cheated on me multiple times throughout our relationship. Her brother begged me to stop so I did. **The Red Pill** I come to The Red Pill destroyed. I crawl here. Bruised. Broken bones. My heart and soul were elevated through the highest clouds and then buried deep under rock and mantle. Im picking up the pieces and putting them back together. I cant fucking help but feel that loving her was impossible to avoid. It just happened to me. It dug itself into my soul. I didnt even know what was happening to me. I feel like a victim. I feel like an idiot. I feel lost. I feel abused and betrayed like a little dog on a leash being stomped by its caregiver. Im looking for a Red Pill perspective on what I did wrong and what my lesson is. This can't happen to me again. *** **Lessons Learned:** - Do not buy pets together. - Do not live together. - Do not idealize marriage, family, or home ownership. - Do not hamster yourself into monogamy. Monogamy does not exist. - Do not respond to her disrespect by mate guarding. Use dread game, boundaries, and a persistent readiness to next her. - Practice game during the relationship. Dont be a complete dumbass and delete the numbers of the sexy women you game. Abundance mentality is everything. - Do not take her back when she dumps you. - You have nothing but your own foolishness, irresponsibility, and ego to blame for your pain and heartbreak. Your ex is not a bitch, especially cruel, heartless, or different in any way from every other female. She did nothing wrong. She was behaving according to natural laws of attraction and mating. YOU fucked up. - Men love women. Women love their kids. Kids love hamsters. And hamsters love nobody. - Loving a girl is an addictive drug and withdrawal is extremely painful. It is a inherent vulnerability. Oneitis is a symptom that you have done something wrong. - She is not yours. She never was yours. She never will be yours. You dont own that pussy or that ass. Train her well, but always remember you will not be the last man to enjoy it. - Vet her relationship with her father. Nothing my ex did was good enough for her father. She told me she was going to school just to spite him. She hated that he started a new family with a different woman when her mom left the country for work. When she dumped me, she told me cheating was in her genes because of her father. - AWALT"
36,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Passing The Ultimate Shit Test: The One You Give Yourself,362,7ls1ez,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7ls1ez/passing_the_ultimate_shit_test_the_one_you_give/,2017-12-24 11:12:34,"The #1 rule in dealing with people being assholes, being arrogant, or making fun of you when it comes to surface level interaction: Laugh. Find humor in it. Humor provides a level of detachment, of separation and enjoyment. **When someones fucking with you, if you are taking it seriously, youve already lost.** The more seriously you take it and the more worked up you get, the more they relish in having control over you. The more worked up **they** get and the more funny **you** find it, the more in control of the situation it puts you. The key is to shift the power dynamic. Find genuine humor in it. People can tell when something has pierced your emotional defenses and is pissing you off. Being angry is vulnerable- it means something got to you. People will pounce on it. Im not saying never get angry or never take certain situations seriously; if there is actual conflict that needs your engagement, by all means, take it seriously, get angry, and at that point if people give you shit for getting worked up it wont matter because the situation matters enough to you that you dont care if you get made fun of. Cultivate yourself so that when important conflict arises, you are not afraid to stand up and face it. But surface level interactions, like shit tests, people making passes at you, and social annoyances are not the time nor the place for that. It just displays emotional weakness. If you get upset, make a big deal about it, and fail the shit test, people will note that you are emotionally weak. But more importantly than that, you ARE emotionally weak. With passing shit tests, the emphasis is often placed on the opinions of others and not wanting to lose face, and that is important, but more important is the state of YOUR being, and being able to deflect shit tests and not only *come across* like it doesnt bother you, but for it to *actually not bother you*. Would you rather have people think nothing bothers you but it actually does, or have people think something got to you but it really didnt? When you get good at passing shit tests, both externally AND internally, you can have the best of both worlds- where nothing bothers you and everyone knows it. **Externally** passing shit tests is what is you can read about in the sidebar- the techniques and things to say to deflect shit tests verbally, to not show any signs of weakness or vulnerability. Agree and amplify, pressure flip, etc my favorite low effort one is when someone tries to insult you and you can tell theyre reaching a little bit far, and so you just look at them, and let it sit in silent for a second raise your eyebrows like you would when looking at a puppy and thinking 'awww', maybe even give them a condescending pat on the back as if to say *""Nice try,* and let them stew in their own embarrassment of a backfired shit test. Point is, externally passing shit tests is what you do to show others you were not phased by it. **Internally** passing shit tests is what you actually feel. If after an interaction you are thinking about what the person said and are feeling upset by it, you find yourself growing angry, you have internally failed. It means you have too much self-doubt, to the point that you are basically shit testing yourself, and subconsciously asking yourself *What if what they said is right what if my taste in music DOES suck? What if my mom IS a whore? Maybe I AM a bitch.* The part that probably bothers you the most is not just the fact that you were shit tested, but the fact that you felt like you failed it. And that you watched yourself fail it- you saw the limits of your being in that moment and saw your insecurity and inadequacy shine forth. If you feel like this after a shit test- regardless of how well you handled yourself, regardless of whether or not the people present felt that you passed it- you failed. Because youre thinking about it. And its bothering you. So what do you do? The first step is to be honest and admit that it is bothering you. If you lie to yourself to act tough you will just feel like more of a bitch. Acknowledge that, at least in this situation, and probably in other avenues of your life, you are a bitch. Once you acknowledge this there is a sense of freedom- there is no holding onto ego, there is no ma alpha fucks bullshit, its just you being honest with yourself: you failed a shit test. It pissed you off. Its bothering you. You are not as mentally strong as you want to be, and you want to get better, you want to be stronger, so that next time a similar situation comes up you will be able to deflect it and not give a fuck, and leave the other person looking like a bitch. But to get to where you want to go, you have to figure out where you are. Right now the bitch is you. Good. Now you are at square one. Where do you go from here? Realize that everything youre feeling is just insecurity. Realize everyone has insecurity. Even Chad, at some point, has undoubtedly failed a shit test, and was ruminating it over in his mind that night getting pissed off and feeling like a bitch. Everyone feels insecurity to some extent. There is one (primary) root cause of insecurity: you do not believe you are adequate. You do not believe you are good enough, youre not good enough to be the kind of person you want to be, and because of that you do not respect yourself. You **can** cultivate a state of mind and self-image that does not care about petty things- insults people throw at you, words spoken by people who are probably more insecure than you- these things do not have to bother you. They do not have to have power over you. And this starts with having discipline, building yourself up to be someone you respect, keeping your promises to yourself, sticking to decision youve made- if you repeatedly tell yourself you want to start working out, start eating healthier, start doing better in college or at your job, and you never do, or maybe youll get on it for a week and then quit, you will not respect yourself. Respect is earned, not given, and likewise you cannot just *give* yourself your own respect. You have to **earn** your own respect. Respect is subconscious. And you earn it through maintaining your frame; through making decisions, and having the discipline to follow the fuck through on them. Dont sit around all day talking; DO something. While someone else is busy and trying to build themselves an empire of words to live in and feel good about themselves, you can be out there DOING things- pump that fucking iron, eat those vegetables and chicken breasts, get out there and make yourself a king- ESPECIALLY when you dont feel like it. If you only grind when you feel like grinding, thats not discipline; thats just you doing what you feel motivated to do in the present moment. tl:dr By cultivating discipline and following through on the things you know you should be doing, you will earn your self-respect and you will feel confident, and when people try to put you down, you wont give a fuck. Because youre too busy living your life and basking in self-validation to care. Externally or verbally passing shit tests is the easy part- just know some words to say. And you should know how to verbally pass shit tests. But passing the ultimate shit test- the quiet one, the shit test that your own subconscious is doing to you, poking your frame, trying to see if you are someone who is worthy of your own respect- THAT is the ultimate shit test you should be trying to pass. And the only way to pass is to have discipline, so that when it's time to grind and do the things you know you should be doing and you hear that little devil floating next to you saying ""nahh, just relax, it's too much effort"" or ""ah, you didn't really want it that bad anyway,"" you smack that bitch to the ground and you DO what you need to do. All of that and more is within your grasp. Now get off the internet and go work out."
37,vulnerability,TheRedPill,"It's better to have 5 weapons you can kill with, instead of having 500 that end up killing you.",200,7dzscz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7dzscz/its_better_to_have_5_weapons_you_can_kill_with/,2017-11-19 21:16:03,"A lot of energetic young people stumble upon that **one post**, and it truly inspires them. They let go of their scepticism after reading that one post. Maybe because its something that truly resonates with them. That is the point at which they get highly motivated, absorb all the information that they can, and start making concrete plans to right whatever they think is wrong in their life **all at once**. Friends, that is a recipe for disaster. &amp;nbsp; Let's face it - change is hard. It takes constant and persistent effort to form new habits, rid yourself of the habits that you formed in 10, 15, 20 years, and learn new skills. Just as you cannot master guitar overnight no matter how much you apply yourself in reading theory, you can't become Chad in a day. So calm yourself down. &amp;nbsp; To bring about a significant change in your old ways, you require **discipline**. Motivation will fade. There will be days you'll feel absolutely terrible. You'll want to not go to the gym, just **this once**. Whats the harm, right? It's just one day. &amp;nbsp; Realise that there are some doors that should never be opened. Because you can never go back. If you can't stand up to yourself, whats the point of you talking about frame? You really think you'll stand up to the vulnerability, the helplessness and the destitution in the eyes of your girl when she snuggles up to you? &amp;nbsp; Discipline requires will power. And **your will is like a muscle**. You start by benching one plate. Then you put on another, then another and then another. Soon, you realise that you have transformed yourself into a beast. &amp;nbsp; You **must** be unshakeable. You must not stray. Once you commit yourself to something, you absolutely have to see it through. **And you can't do that if you can't even keep track of all the things you have committed yourself to.** &amp;nbsp; Start with lifting. Get to the point where it no longer feels like work, or better, you look forward to wrestling with iron. Then start going out, talking to women in your social circle. Talk to women in your extended social circle. Then start warm approaches. Then try cold ones. Discover what you like, find your flow. &amp;nbsp; Once talking to people no longer feels like work, introduce another change. Stick with it until it no longer feels like work, then introduce another, and so on. &amp;nbsp; One more important things is **to believe**. The people who you admire, or want to be more like, are also humans. If they can do it, you can do it. And we have a very generous community here to help us stay on the path. You have to believe that it's not magic, or genetics, or some other bullshit school of thought you like to subscribe to. You have to believe that you can achieve the same, if you put in enough effort. It might take you 10 years. It might take you 20 years. Hell, you might even die before you're able to do the stuff you wanna do. But you have to believe that you can do it. &amp;nbsp; Whenever you find yourself finding a reason why you can't do something, find a counterexample. If you can't find it, well then, maybe you really can't do it. But there's only one way to find out for sure. &amp;nbsp; Some people like to introduce change by the shock and awe method. They go to the other extreme end, and then find a balance. That may work well for certain things. But it's critical to focus on **one thing at a time**. By being impatient, you will do more damage than you'll do good. After following crash diets, people end up weighing more than they weighed to begin with, with less willingness to do it all over again. And the experience is trying on the soul. &amp;nbsp; **Aside** : If you consider yourself a superior being, YMMV. More power to you. But for us plebians, it is absolutely essential that you don't try to do it all at once. &amp;nbsp; Edit: Grammar and formatting. "
38,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Stages of red pill metabolism,47,7e052a,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7e052a/stages_of_red_pill_metabolism/,2017-11-19 22:49:36,"I'd like to posit a general timeline that men in the manosphere tend to traverse. Much of the content here will be personal projection as, obviously, my own life is the instance of red pill metabolism I am most intimately aware of, but I have inclinations toward the idea that these stages are more universal than not. Finally, I'm interested in what stages occur after the one that I'm currently in--which I think is about 2 years into stage 5. I'll speculate in my description of stage 6. **Stage 1 - Default blue pill gynocentrism** Stage 1 is the blue pill default. It is defined by a scarcity mentality heavily correlated with a proclivity to oneitis. Stage one is useful to the species because it promotes genetically healthy reproductive habits: men fight, violently or by signalling, over women they have oneitis for, while simultaneously being highly useful to women for protection and resource procurement. My belief is that gynocentrism is biologically default and that all men have strong, innate blue pill tendencies, not that the blue pill is a certain modern ideological strand. This is little more than a hunch but is a result of observing so many repeated examples of otherwise alpha men turning out to be hopelessly beta as well as my own innate blue pill nature, loosely inferring the possibility that all men are, in their heart of hearts, blue pill: see otherwise badass WWII soldiers in shell-shock crying for their mothers during moments of desperation in war. In this sense I feel that alpha-male characteristics aren't exactly natural, that they're a foreign and modern upgrade to our weak natural software in the same way that things like exercise and meditation are foreign, natural upgrades to our biological default. While interesting, this isn't necessary to my thesis here. **Stage 2 - Discovery of red pill truths** Stage 2 occurs when disillusioning truths about women are discovered. These truths are often expressed by the man newly internalizing them in terms antagonistic to women and with the demeanor of apparent or actual bitterness (anger phase, for some). The ""women are shit"" mentality is common in this stage. Relatedly, I was raised in a cult and, being active in a forum of members who too have left, I encounter a similar phenomenon: People break free from an institution (gynocentrism, organized religion) that they realize has been lying to and robbing them, and a period of anger is natural and, to a degree, helpful in reversing the emotional bonds they were previously shackled due to. Reduced to its most basic mechanism, I'd summarize red pill truth thusly: While men instinctively value women for their gentleness, vulnerability, and reproductive fitness, women value men for their perceived ability to, in a world of threats, protect, provide, and donate to them high quality sperm. The bitterness or anger phase largely comes from men hoping to be valued by women for their gentleness and vulnerability--ultimately female traits that they assumed or were taught were attractive to females by a sort of weird demasculinized modern sexual egalitarianism probably ultimately the result of the industrial revolution. **Stage 3 - Learning how to navigate the sexual marketplace equipped with these new truths** A lot of guys here, I think, haven't make it to stage 3 yet. Stage 3 occurs when a man proceeds to explore what sort of pleasures and forms of new happiness he can find in the sexual marketplace after being disenchanted of his former gynocentric assumptions. It is during this phase that he sets down his farming tools and becomes a viking. Within stage 3, I'd posit a couple of sub-stages defined by these sentiments: * Wow, getting sex isn't that hard at all if you just employ RP tools. * Casual sex isn't that great, not worth the effort! * Well, I'm still horny so I might as well keep doing it. * Oh wow, this is very easy now--like autopilot. * Approaches triple-digit n-count. * So, do I just do this forever then? In post-religious communities, a similar phenomenon is experienced: * Now I have new freedoms to do x,y,z. * Does x,y,z, enjoys it. * So, is this like the purpose of life then? It is not my contention that this stage is healthy for society as it in some ways resembles the habit of some people to visit soap and perfume stores only to repeatedly use their sample items, or to purchase, use, and return equipment. That said, I don't know that I currently ""care about society"" per se--ask me in 5 years. **Stage 4 - Disenchantment with loose sexual marketplace connections** Stage 4 is defined by an attitude of further disenchantment that accumulates as a result of: * The cognitive dissonance of having sexual intimacy without hitting any or many of the emotional-intimacy neurotransmitters that probably exist objectively in the male mind and are not merely the result of blue pill or gynocentric attitudes. * The tiresomeness of getting to know a new girl, or of pretending to be engaged in the process of getting to know new girls. Stage 4 mirrors the stage of a someone who was forbidden to drink alcohol until he finally decided to disobey, drinks a lot of alcohol, and then questions whether drinking a lot of alcohol per se is necessarily ideal in and of itself. **Stage 5 - Finding a sustainable equilibrium in relationships** In stage 5, a man begins to explore the possibility of satisfying the full range of his sexual and emotional needs simultaneously and efficiently. This is the stage at which the role that the opposite sex plays in his life will find it's proper spot: not the hamstering, self-denial MGTOW 0% and not the desperate pick-up artist 70%, but at something around 25%. At this level of investment, a man is supplied with levels of emotional support and effortless access to sex that allow him to focus on his personal goals and projects with the greatest degree of concentration and effort. It is in this stage of life that I believe men are their most productive and happy. The enjoyment of this stage, without falling victim to the institution of marriage and possibly children, may be rare among a sea of men stuck and drowning in stages 1-4. It's arguable that entering stage 5 and enjoying it indefinitely requires the personal development skills that all the successive stages described in this post teach him. Ultimately, a large amount of legal reform regarding cohabitation, marriage, and family will be necessary before stage 5 can reach it's maximum potential. It'd seem that marriage, cohabitation in common-law marriage legal zones, and potentially even child-rearing are too risky and should be avoided even by a man with the game ability to otherwise thrive in a stage 5 lifestyle, although I take men at their word when they talk about the vast joys of having and raising kids. **Stage 6 - ""Retirement"" from the majority of sexual marketplace navigation / development** Though a man may need to trade in his woman for a new one every couple of years, a man is now more free than ever before to pursue and master his various career and extracurricular goals and projects unobstructed by unnecessary levels of heartbreak or loneliness."

Remember a specific time. Go back to that specific time, and ask yourself the three questions below. (If you've never been jealous, then think of a time when you were angry at someone.) Find out HOW you created this state for yourself by discovering: a) What did you picture about that person? Were you conscious of any images about what you thought that person did or didn't do? Note how much power these pictures either have or don't have in terms of your feeling the state of jealousy. (Note: the pictures may not be that important to you, or you may not be aware of them-you may have to go to step b.) b) What did you hear or say to yourself about this experience?-i.e. the other person's voice saying what, or what did you say to yourself-note both the words and the tonality of how those words were said. c) What did you feel in your body?-what sensations did you feel in your body when you were feeling the state of jealousy-like temperature, posture, breathing, muscular tension, feeling in the stomach, facial expressions, etc. Notice which of the three representation. all systems is the most powerful for you-which has the most power to put you in the state of jealousy. You should also notice now that this is just a state, and can be changed by focusing on something that makes you feel good. 2. Follow the same procedure as in number 1, but choose the state of love. Remember a time when you felt totally loved or loving. Remember a specific time, and go back to that time, and discover HOW you go into the state of love, and notice the difference in pictures, internal dialogue and physiology between these two states.

Also, it helps to determine which disqualifiers are appropriate if any, and helps build rapport. During conversation with her, ask yourself: - What type of personality does she have? - Does she have a low or high self-esteem? - Is she sexually open or reserved? - What does she do for work? - Is she currently in a relationship? - Is she an oldest, youngest, middle, or the only child? - Is she closer to her mother or to her father? - Is she primarily athletic, emotional, or intellectual? - What qualities is she attracted to in men? - What are her needs? - Where is she in life and what is she looking for? DO Instead of looking for what she likes look for the things she responds to. DO You need to speak to her using terms from their preferred system, that will create great feelings of rapport and warmth, because you are, in effect , speaking to her in the language her brain prefers. What to do and how to do it. If he had listened to the words she used to determine which Representation System she was thinking in, he would have heard the visual words and realized his declarations of love were 'falling on deaf ears.' Then he could have adapted his language and behaviour to show her he loved her, and they both would have been satisfied. It is that simple -- to listen for the Representational words which indicate in what sense the person is thinking, and to adjust your communication style to match. As you begin to notice what people say, you will note they are revealing their Representational System preference all the time, Right handed is standard. If she is left handed, reverse the eye cues. Did not collect data on ambidextrous ladies. Visional Visional remembered pictures Visual constructed Talking Visually - ""I see this magazine in front of me."" I see what you mean Looks good to me. I get the picture. When you think: Visually - Imagine a picture of your mother's face. Kinesthetic Talking Kinesthetically - ""I feel this magazine in my hands."" It feels right to me. I can't grasp the point. I catch your drift. When you think: Kinesthetically - Remember a time you felt powerful and motivated Auditory Auditory remembered Auditory constructed Auditory digital Auditory internal dialogue Talking Auditorily - ""I hear the sounds and noises around me."" I hear you. It rings a bell. That clicks When you think: Auditorily - Recall a conversation you had yesterday. We structure our internal representations through our five senses, and primarily through the three major modalities (representational systems): visual (V), auditory (A), kinesthetic (K). You might consider your senses the ingredients from which you build any experience or result. But as any good cook will tell you, you have to know the precise quantity of each ingredient as well in order to get the specific result. We refer to the quantities of each modality as SUBMODALITIES. We can change two things about the way we represent events in our life. We can change what we represent-thus, for example. if we imagine the worst possible scenario, we can change to picturing the best possible scenario. Or we can change how we represent something-for example, some people find that picturing something as being very, very large is critical for a state of great motivation. Other people find that the specific tone of voice they use when they talk to themselves makes a major difference in their level of state of motivation. Sub modalities are the smallest and most precise building blocks that make up the structure of human experience. Eye Movements and NLP Eyes Up and Left: Non-dominant hemisphere visualization - i.e., remembered imagery (Vr). Eyes Up and Right: Dominant hemisphere visualization - i.e., constructed imagery and visual fantasy (Vc). Eyes Lateral Left: Non-dominant hemisphere auditory processing - i.e., remembered sounds, words, and ""tape loops"" (Ar) and tonal discrimination. Eyes Lateral Right: Dominant hemisphere auditory processing - i.e., constructed sounds and words (Ac). Eyes Down and Left: Internal dialogue, or inner self-talk (Ad). Eyes Down and Right: Feelings, both tactile and visceral (K). Eyes Straight Ahead, but Defocused or Dilated: Quick access of almost any sensory information; but usually visual. Basic NLP EyeAccessing Cues This pattern appears to be constant for right handed people throughout the human race (with the possible exception of the Basques, whose population appears to contain a fair number of 'exceptions to the rule'). Subsequent studies(Loiselle, 1985 and Buckner, Reese and Reese, 1987) have supported the NLPclaim that eye movements both reflect and influence key cognitive components of thought. Many left handed people, however, tend to be reversed from left toright. That is, their eye accessing cues are the mirror image of those of the average right hander. They look down and left for feelings, instead of down and right. Similarly, they look up and to the right to remember visual imagery,instead of up and to the left, and so on. A small number of people (including ambidextrous and a few right handed people) will be reversed in their some of their eye accessing cues (their visual eye movements, for example), but not the others. To explore the relationship between eye movements and thinking for yourself, find partner, ask the following questions, and observe his or her eye movements.For each question keep track of your partner's eye movements in one of the boxes (following the questions below) by using marks, lines or numbers that represent the sequence of positions you observe. Visual Remembered: Think of the color of your car. What kind of pattern is on your bedspread? Think of the last time you saw someone running. Who were the first five people you saw this morning? Visual Construction: Imagine an outline of yourself as you might look from six feet above us and see it turning into a city skyline. Can you imagine the top half of a toy dog on the bottom half of a green hippopotamus? Auditory Remembered: Can you think of one of your favourite songs? Think of the sound of clapping. How does your car's engine sound? Auditory Constructed: Imagine the sound of a train's whistle changing into the sound of pages turning. Can you hear the sound of a saxophone and the sound of your mother's voice at the same time? Auditory Digital (Internal Self Talk): Take a moment and listen to the sound of your own inner voice. How do you know it is your voice? In what types of situations do you talk to yourself the most? Think of the kinds of things that you say to yourself most often. Kinesthetic Remembered: (Tactile) When was the last time you felt really wet? Imagine the feelings of snow in your hands. What does a pine cone feel like? When was the last time you touched a hot cooking utensil? (Visceral/Emotional) Can you think of a time you felt satisfied about something you completed? Think of what it feels like to be exhausted. When was the last time you felt impatient? Kinesthetic Construction: (Tactile) Imagine the feelings of stickiness turning into the feelings of sand shifting between your fingers. Imagine the feelings of dog's fur turning into the feelings of soft butter. (Visceral/Emotional) Imagine the feelings of frustration turning into the feeling of being really motivated to do something. Imagine the feeling of being bored turning into feeling silly about feeling bored. It is important to keep in mind, as you are observing and tracking eye movements, that many people will already have habitual eye movements, related to their primary representational modality. A highly visual person may tend to look up and to the left or right, regardless of which sensory modality is assumed by your question. If you ask such a person to think of his or her ""favorite song,"" the person may visualize the cover of the record, tape or CD in order to remember the name of the song. A kinesthetically oriented person may look down and check his or her feelings to determine how he or she feels about several songs in order to know which one is his or her ""favourite.""Thus it is important to ask people what they actually did in their minds as they were answering the questions in order to get an accurate sense of what their eye movements signified. Once you feel confident in eye movements as accessing cues, and in your ability to""read"" them, there are many ways they can be used. As was mentioned earlier, habitual eye movements reflect a person's preferred sensory modality.If you ask someone, ""What is something that is really important to you?Think of it now,"" the placement of the person's eyes as he or she is answering your question will probably tell you a lot about that person's most valued representational system. Eye movements can also be used to determine how truthful or congruent a person is being. If a person is describing an event that he or she has witnessed or participated in, for instance, the person's eyes should move primarily to his or her left (if the person is right handed), indicating memory access. If the person looks up and to the right a lot, however, it is likely that the person is constructing or reconstructing some aspect of the experience he or she is describing. This may indicate that the person is either uncertain or being untruthful about what he or she is saying. The most common application of eye positions in NLP is to determine the representational strategies a person is using in order to think or make a decision. Since many aspects of people's thinking processes are unconscious to them, spontaneous eye movements can be an extremely important part of eliciting and modeling a person's inner strategies for decision making, learning, motivation, memory, etc. You can also see what representational system  a person is using by watching their eyes. The chart below shows what eye positions are related to which representational system, and a few questions you can ask to get a person to access those representational systems. Continued in part 2"
40,vulnerability,TheRedPill,(FR) Same Night Lay,0,7ikqlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7ikqlh/fr_same_night_lay/,2017-12-09 15:47:10,"Here is my first field report. Im leaving immaterial details to avoid any recognition (you never know). Basic summary is: same night lay (We are back, clothing off and in bed fucking within about 3 hours from meeting for drinks), probably could have been 2 hours if I were super aggressive. Ok, this is my first date in forever since I normally just go for ONS, never meet the girl before. Online profile contains typically female shit, esp. no hook-ups, swipe left or trump supporter, swipe left. TRP has taught me that is all BS (obviously, cause I banged her) and I ignore it. I engage her in maybe several lines of banter (hidden kino of course) and then suggest we meet up this weekend for drinks. Let me make it abundantly clear, my bander had one purpose and that is to strongly suggest FUN as in aka sex. Next, following the TRP advice, I text only for logistics (time and place). She actually shot down my first attempt to meet-up by saying tonight is not good how about this other date. My response is no problem that works. I text her about an 2 hours before the said time and she confirms. We meet and I kiss her immediately saying, Hello, Jane, we finally meet and she sits down. She actually looks better than her pictures because of make-up but I would be her as a solid 7. So I am thinking this is a score for me since I expected borderline 6. I have my own scale and its pretty much I do not touch anything 1 through 4. 5 and 6 are ONS or a booty call. 7 -8 is a plate. If I actually scored a 9, which is for all intents and purposes is what we all seek because Im over the unicorn fallacy (a perfect 10 does not exist) I would probably knock her up. I wont marry her but I would just knock her up for sure. Anyway, back to the date. Body language initially is clearly nervous, hands figity, does not maintain eye contact long, rambling, asking questionsI sit back and present a relaxed posture, stoic and listen for the meta. The meta is who is the individual and what are they about? How do I talk their language and how do I connect with them to create an instant rapport. I ask some few basic questions and tailor my responses to show I am familiar with interests. TIP: this is why you should be reading the news and articles to keep abreast of things. Professional females with careers, which is this chick, have a pet interest depending on their work or city. So if you are meeting around Wall Street better know what a short isyoure meeting some tattooed, hipster chick..better know the bar with the craft beer and mixology whateveronce I show her that I speak her language, she relaxes. My next objective is to make her laugh but from my perspective, so find something that is ironic or that I find funny and she laughs..check. At this point, I look at my watch because my plan was to cut off the date after three drinks and go out to party. WHY? Because she blew me off the first suggestion for a date. AND I am learning NOT to put pussy as my number one objective and use it to validate my Masculinity. I wanted to show abundance because I was fairly confident that I could pull another chick that night later on. Well, she immediately gets insecure and asked me, did you make other planstalk about mirco-expressions, she panicked and I saw it. This was the turning point in the date for me. I had her right there. I looked dread in the face for that split moment (micro-expression). NOw this was planned, I choose to look at my watch at the peak of her comfort and attraction. Since she showed the vulnerability, I said well, I did make plans. Because I do not want to give the details on the next exchange, I am not. Suffice it to say that she eluded to being free the night of the evening and something to effect of making it worth my while.game over. I replied, jokingly, well in light of this new information, I am going to make this accommodation, but I better not be disappointed. I had gained control, had attraction, and had her basically submitting. I suggested that we leave immediately to go to another bar, a bar closer to the area where she i found out where she lived and proceeded to get a few more drinks in her for good measureand eventually she whispered in my ear, lets go back to my placeand lets just say that lifting for the last year has given me some good stamina, to rock her all night long. Thats the version of the night that highlights TRP stuff. Of course, I had to navigate through certain questions and tests..what approach did I take??? Ignore or deflect. She asked if I voted for trump, I say I dont know anyone that did, did you? Of course I did, I fuken voted from him and my friends. I lied. IDGAF, i wanted to get laid. She asked what I am looking for, I say, what is everyone looking for, nobody knows these daysfucking millennials This is where I am holding frame. TIP: I personally know I broke frame, twice and I know precisely when I broke frame and YOU KNOW WHAT??? Here is the kicker, she stopped me. She said, something to the effect... just hold that though or forget I even askedand started kissing me again. Because I was making out with her she didnt care. she had the tingles and everything else that i did was immaterial to her. and that is why chad can say anything, cause he gets the tingles first. Lastly boys, her fucking pussy was wet and a wet pussy makes the sex so much better and rewardingI am not going to lie, I felt like I conquered this pussy. I woke up the next morning, banged her again and said I had to go to work, maybe well see each other againand walked out. Did I slipp here and there, of course, but I hung on and closed. And that my fellow TRPer is what it's all about. I set a goal and immediately accomplished it. AND i was perfectly willing to walk away from the chick and have not contacted her since. I might, maybe on rainy day, with, ""let's meet up for drinks, again...""maybe EDIT: I literally just submitted and someone downvoted in less time than it took to read this...whatever, who is on here downvoting rando posts.. I wanted to say this to you all: i did college admissions/guidance for several years at inner city HS, I told everyone, there is a college out there for you...there is a college for everyone. ERGO: there is girl out there for you all. IF you are 5.5, balding, little dick, whatever, there is a little hottie, ready to suck your dick and you'll love it. don't compare yourself to 6'2"" blonde hair, blue eyes, start quarterback getting the pornstar look alike blonde haired bimbo with big tits...QUITE FRANKLY, just buy her and fuck her...you know what, it won't be that different or maybe worse that dominating that little latina 6 down the block...don't over shoot... ok,Good Luck,"
41,vulnerability,TheRedPill,"Justin Baldoni: ""Why I'm Done Trying to Be Man Enough""",74,7irzub,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7irzub/justin_baldoni_why_im_done_trying_to_be_man_enough/,2017-12-10 16:02:36,"**TLDR:** Top 1% male tells the rest of men that ""toxic masculinity"" is the problem. That it's men's job to ""fix"" this issue. Quoting the gender pay gap, #metoo and other buzz words, Justin asks women to help and support men being more ""vulnerable"" and open. Cheers all around. **Preface:** I want to be clear here. It is my own personal belief The Red Pill helps to enforce masculinity, **NOT** misogyny. Its a discussion of sexual strategy in a culture increasingly lacking a positive identity for men. There is anger here. There is pain here and on AskTRP. There are harsh words and stern replies. Theres amoral strategy, and theres also holding men accountable. Personal accountability is one of the highest virtues that is taught here. Theres a reason the pill is so damn hard to swallow. **Summary:** [A good intro.](URL In today's fight against the [destruction of masculinity, and I do mean destruction](URL men are being [told, and encouraged to behave like women](URL Today's boys are being bombarded with [anti-masculine messages and media]( URL **Enter Justin Baldoni.** [A short summary of Mr. Baldoni.](URL He is a top 1% male actor with high status, and a bountiful access to resources. Recently [he made this TED talk.](URL Which will be the discussion for today. I suggest viewing of the whole video as I will be providing commentary on specific points brought up in the video. **Mr. Baldoni is tired of being a man** &gt;""Ive been pretending to be a man Im not my entire life, Ive been pretending to be strong when I felt weak, confident when I felt insecure, and tough when really I was hurting. I think for the most part, Ive been putting on a show, but Im tired of performing. And I can tell you right now that it is exhausting trying to be man enough for everyone all the time. Mr. Baldoni sets the stage for his talk. He entices his audience with a progressive view on his masculinity and wants you to know that he's a vulnerable individual. He's not *one of those* types of men. He is in touch with his feelings. Also, he wants you to know that he gets shirtless in his acting roles. **Men and Women are different** &gt;As a boy, all I wanted was to be accepted and liked by the other boys, but that acceptance meant I had to acquire this almost **disgusted view of the feminine**, and since we were told that feminine is the opposite of masculine, I either had to reject embodying any of these qualities or face rejection myself. This is the script that we've been given. Right? **Girls are weak, and boys are strong.** No. Feminism has turned the simple biological truth that men and women are **different** in every single aspect of life, into a warped gender power struggle of men vs girls. **The Patriarchy**. This is how victimization works. By creating a power struggle problem where there was none, you purposely create a victim mentality. Yes, adopting more masculine qualities as a man, will garner you more friends/resources/popularity/opportunity with other men. Men form groups with other men. Your personal opinion of what is a *disgusted view of the feminine* needs to be defined. Also, what about trans, queer, otherkin and xe? **We are in agreemen....never mind.** &gt; But I don't have a desire to **fit into the current broken definition of masculinity**, because I don't just want to be a good man. I want to be a good human. And I believe the only way that can happen is if men learn to not only embrace the qualities that we were told are feminine in ourselves but to be willing to stand up, to champion and learn from the women who embody them. If you had ended the sentence after the bold words, we would have been in agreement. Society today does teach a warped, broken version of masculinity. [Being a normal boy is a serious liability in today's classroom.](URL The rest of your comment is emotional think at best, and damaging at worst. Men are aware of feminine qualities. You know what happens to men who embrace these qualities and the wisdom of ""just be yourself""? Women don't respond. Men are realizing, more then ever, that the routine that has been taught to them is a path to celibacy, orbiting, and ultimately, unhappiness. [Women do not care about feminine men. In fact, they despise them.](URL **I agree** &gt; So why couldn't my grandfather just reach out to another man and ask for help? Why does my dad to this day still think he's got to do it all on his own? I know a man who would rather die than tell another man that they're hurting. I firmly believe there is a time and place for men to express lifes difficulties and stresses with other men in a learning environment. Having a mentor, a close friend, the family patriarch. Masculinity as taught by women is not a solution. [Feminism has sought to remove the modern family and has branded *fatherhood* unimportant to raising a child](URL You also removed any chance of having a civil discourse the second you labeled any masculinity other then how you view it as ""toxic"". **The Magnum Opus** &gt; Your strength, your bravery, your toughness: Can we redefine what those mean and use them to explore our hearts? Are you brave enough to be vulnerable? To reach out to another man when you need help? To dive headfirst into your shame? Are you strong enough to be sensitive, to cry whether you are hurting or you're happy, even if it makes you look weak? Are you confident enough to listen to the women in your life? To hear their ideas and their solutions? To hold their anguish and actually believe them, even if what they're saying is against you? And will you be man enough to stand up to other men when you hear ""locker room talk,"" when you hear stories of sexual harassment? When you hear your boys talking about grabbing ass or getting her drunk, will you actually stand up and do something so that one day we don't have to live in a world where a woman has to risk everything and come forward to say the words ""me too?"" This is a complex way of saying that masculine values such as strength, bravery, and toughness are akin with stubbornness, pride, refusing to listen to women and ideas, believing everything women say a face value, not questioning a woman's thoughts or values. You have effectively demonized men and manly virtues. You have also painted women as a victim. Completely remove all female responsibility from the discussion. After all, it's all the man's fault. A better question would be, are you man enough to bottle everything up and take a step to do the hard things in life, instead of breaking down? **Woah. There's some feminists who would like to talk to you.** &gt;I don't have time to get into porn and violence against women or the split of domestic duties or the gender pay gap. **But I believe that as men, it's time we start to see past our privilege and recognize that we are not just part of the problem. Fellas, we are the problem.** The glass ceiling exists because we put it there, and if we want to be a part of the solution, then words are no longer enough. Did he just mention porn in the same sentence and violence against women? There's a huge push Mr. Baldoni for sexual empowerment for sex workers. [Pornography falls under that.](URL Gender pay gap? [This has been refuted many times.](URL There's a reason no reputable economist supports the gender pay gap myth. Remember, men are at fault for women's suffering and victim-hood. The patriarchy is responsible for all of women's problems. Never mind individual choice. Take all responsibility from decision making and place blame solely on men. **Final Point:** We all know that [a top 1% male can say or do just about anything, and women will respond with admiration.](URL So, it's of no surprise that Mr.Baldoni can say these things and women will flock to him. [Meanwhile, other male feminists get vitriol.](URL [Some cannot even be feminists, due to the fact that they are born male.](URL *There's irony in the above link. Under #7 it clearly states: &gt;Beware men who dump their emotions on you and pretend that their vulnerability (in asking you to bear their burden) is a feminist act. Beware men who seek out women specifically to manage their emotional trauma for them. Beware men who treat you as a sounding board off of which to bounce their internal struggles with manhood. **The Takeaway** **In order to combat sexism, men, based on sex, need to shut up and listen to all women, based on sex, and legitimize whatever they are saying, because not only have men never faced sexism, but they are also the main perpetrators of sexism as well as having created the glass ceiling. Therefore, they also have no right to decide if they are being sexist. Also, you are more masculine by embracing your feminine qualities that you should learn by female example.** I open the floor to discussion. "
42,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Your gut is all you have,8,77wckr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/77wckr/your_gut_is_all_you_have/,2017-10-22 09:04:13,"Have you ever met someone that would give their life for you - or are you able to realize that you would be hard pressed to find anyone that would even come close to doing so? Your gut is all you have and it'll lead you to your best self. There's no one in this world that will protect you at the expense of themselves. In a life or death situation, most people would save themselves. In most cases, death doesn't have to be involved. It could be something as simple as a confrontation with the cops. What are the odds of them not ratting you out if they were totally clean? If there's no one out there on your side, what's stopping you from being on your own side - the things you have been programmed to believe and your conscience, but there is a way to circumvent that. Follow your gut. Follow it boldly, follow it blindly, and follow it without a second thought. Your 'gut' is a compilation of the things you've read, experienced, and heard. It's a supercomputer that analyzes everything at a speed that's impossible to comprehend in your stream of consciousness. The gut has evolved over time to follow your basic instincts - procreate and survive. It will never deceive you. Billionaires like trump(businessman to president with no prior exp) and mark cuban(poor guy to billionaire) follow it, ceos follow it when faced with tough decisions, as well as many other important people. Their gut has served them well. Why wouldn't yours do the same for you? Your gut is now your motherfucking best friend. Treat it with the utmost respect. For the past few weeks, I've been following my gut to the T. I say what I want and do what I want. In order for you to properly follow your gut, you must be honest with yourself and openly acknowledge it. What you like isn't determined by what others think you should like or what you've been taught. Sometimes the things you like may even surprise you. But.. Before you're able to follow your gut, ask yourself what you truly desire. Do you like them fat? Do you like women that look like men, Do you like muscular women, Do you like ugly women, Do you like women that are gold diggers, Do you not care for women at all, Do you like men? The answers may hurt (your preconceived notions about yourself), but they'll make you more you and allow you to confidently search for what you like. I have taken the time to analyze myself and I can say for absolute certainty that I like attractive women that are unable to resist me - when im screening hard. I like a woman that fawns over me because she can't help it. I like a woman that'll do anything I ask because she's just hopelessly sprung. It turns me on like no other because I can see the vulnerability in her eyes when it's true and I believe that there's nothing stronger(in a female) than a female that allows herself to reach a state that places her heart completely on the line with hope that I won't destroy it. Keep in mind that it's easy for me to sense this because i've known for years that that's what I like. Being that I know what I'm looking for in a chick, I can filter through the others that are too damaged or cautious to reach that level. I rely on my gut to navigate me through situations like this. For example: I see a hottie that gets my gut going - I'm approaching full force and nothing will stop me I'm talking to a female and I get the sense that she isn't eating up my words - Sometimes I eject. Sometimes I go for the number anyway. If she doesn't show the signs immediately, chances are she will never reach the state that I like. I've(my gut has) yet to be proven wrong. I'm talking to a female and I sense that she finds me irresistible - I go for the insta lay, insta date, kiss, or whatever my gut tells me in the moment. I'm talking to a female and she's consciously fighting what I'm saying to her, but I sense that her hamster is finding it impossible to resist - I persist like a madman. My persistence is a catalyst for the state that I want her to reach. I'm texting/talking to a chick and I get the sense that i'm wasting my time - I don't bother to reply or I just eject from the situation. I'm hanging with a female and I can sense that my attention on its own isn't driving her wild - I either get what I came for and eject after or I eject immediately if I have better things to do. I've found a chick that has been eating up my words and willing to die for my attention but I then get a sense that she's exiting my preferred state - I either get what I came for and eject after or I eject immediately if I have better things to do. Once she exits the state I like, she will never get back to it. I've been dealing with a female for a while and my gut tells me that there's no further point in dealing with her - immediate ghost. This has led to many pump and dumps For each of these situations, I'm navigating by my gut and executing the action consciously. These are just a few of the situations that my gut navigates for me. I know what I truly like in a female - her heart, mind, and soul being absolutely and completely vulnerable to me. My gut navigates everything and I respect his wishes. That is my brother and I trust him more than I trust myself(my stream of consciousness). Following your gut will leave many broken hearted women in your wake, but you will forever have your frame. You will destroy your insecurities. Think about this - you meet a hottie and your gut says to take her to your place and try to fvck her. You succeed. A few days later, your gut tells you that she has absolutely nothing to offer so you immediately ghost her - You've just created an alpha widow. It wasn't because you're a conniving jerk that only used her for sex, but because your gut told you that she didn't have what you like. Not your problem. Your gut is all you have and it'll never deceive you. Rarely will it lack enough information to make the correct decision. Trust it. Filter every situation through it because that's what will make you truly YOU. URL Stay Icy"

My relationship ended, then a lot of things started collapsing in front of me, So he stopped being a man. &gt;We spoke of emotional labor, consent, violence, communication, empathy, and vulnerability, he adds, noting that the last subject, in particular, was a struggle for him: [I was] trained and conditioned to be tough growing up. Not a word about getting stronger, healthier, or less vulnerable through more muscles, better diet or a martial art. This article makes me sick. Here's the problem  Toxic Masculinity! &gt;toxic masculinity has four main components: suppression of anything stereotypically feminine; suppression of emotions related to vulnerability, like fear, sadness, or helplessness; male domination over women and other men; and aggression. I hereby confess to being toxic. I have no desire for feminine activities. Taking a bath? Nope. Sitting and talking? Not without a game on. Poetry? Red, Blue, It's Over, Thank You! Suppression of emotions? Hell yeah I do. Worthless emotions like fear and sadness and helplessness are are indicators that I need to change. I use them to motivate me to improve my strength, my health, and to learn how to avoid repeating what doesn't satisfy me. Also, I go do what I know makes me happy. Feeling sad and helpless? Do something that makes you happy. I like driving fast and burning rubber. I'm smiling thinking about lunch hour and smelling hot rubber when I pull out. I like shooting guns. Hard to be in a bad mood when blowing up jugs full of water. I like snow skiing. Hard to be unhappy when going 40 mph down a mountain. When unhappy, go do what makes you happy. Male domination? Yes, and you had better start with dominating yourself. Here's a domination starter: Use the word NO. Use it! Simply telling people NO will get you branded selfish and domineering. So what? I was told a few years ago, You only care about yourself. And my reply was, Put it on my grave stone, and the answer is still NO. Aggression? I'm full of it. When playing football, my favorite sound was hearing the air gush out of someone when I hit them. Aggression allows me to be better, to have more, to fulfill my goals. When pulling up to a four-way stop and the other guy doesn't go immediately despite getting there first, I go. My time is valuable. Read the article to the end and did the unhappy fellow get the girl? Nope! There wasn't a damned word about why he lost his girl and how he changed to be a better man. In fact, he's now worse off because he has learned to be more deliberate about expressing emotions and making space for people. This sack-less fool has learned to be a women. If you want to be a man, be strong, be a leader, do what makes you happy. Off to burn rubber."
44,vulnerability,TheRedPill,God Can't Bleed,285,78iqnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/78iqnu/god_cant_bleed/,2017-10-25 07:51:40,"Swallowing the pill is never something you do just once. There's many different pills of many different flavors. They might all be red, but they all contain different information. Some are easier to swallow than others, however. Some take a few tries. But every once in a while, there comes a pill you need only swallow just one time. For those who have experienced a woman's love and affection wither away at the sight of your suffering, that pill hurt all the way down. But you only had to take it once. ##Men are Powerful As many of us know, women don't love men the way men love women. It's not a bad thing. They have a biological imperative pushing them towards that ultimate goal. There's nothing wrong with that, but you need to be aware of it. Referring quickly to the set of rules many should already have internalized; &gt;Iron Rule of Tomassi #6 ""Women are utterly incapable of loving a man in the way that a man expects to be loved."" Ideally, we'd like to believe that the women we let get close to us would be as invested in our emotional well-being as we were with theirs. And to a very certain degree, they are. But there is one major difference. Where as our desire to care for a woman emotionally usually comes out of an innate desire to protect, secure and comfort, their desire to see us emotionally strong stems from the ultimate goal of making sure we remain capable enough to keep providing the protection, support and comfort that they seek. A man's support is quite often altruistic, where as a woman's desire to support is inherently selfish. This is usually the spot where most readers new to TRP are lost, and refuse to accept that fact that when a woman says she loves you, what she's really saying is *""at this current point in time, I love you because you're checking off my emotional and physical wishlist, but the second that stops, I won't feel the same way"".* Returning to my original point, the hardest pill for a man to swallow was the one he took when he opened up to his LTR, either as a sign of vulnerability or in an attempt to garner emotional comfort or support during a time of desperation, and had his efforts and feelings subliminally spat back into his face. I'll try to paint a picture as best as I can; *""You live behind a big wall. This wall keeps you safe. It's tall, made of stone and well built. It keeps out the invaders and all beings that would seek to do you harm, either physically or mentally. Behind this wall, you feel safe. You know it can't be breached. Until one day, someone shows you one small, insignificant area of that massive stone aegis that is deteriorating. He then explains that should anything trying to get through the wall find out about this weakness, despite its small size and apparent insignificance, they would be able to break it down. And just like that, your illusion of safety is shattered. The wall looks strong, but you know it has a weakness. Could the wall stand forever without anyone gaining the knowledge of how to get through it? Maybe. But are you willing to gamble your life on it? Mostly likely, you aren't. Since you don't possess the knowledge to fix it (honestly, you can't even comprehend the kind of stress and pressure this wall must have to manage in the first place), you have two options. Live in constant fear and concern that one day, your once proud protector will crumble and fall, or find a new, stronger wall in a new place that doesn't have the same weaknesses your old wall had. Since safety and comfort is your number one concern, the choice is obvious"".* Men are naturally powerful. They are the guardians of women and have been for thousands and thousands of years. In that time, women have learned to gravitate towards the beacons of strength that are the Alpha male. Yes, he provides the best opportunity for breeding, but she'll spend the entirety of her time with him trying to convince the Alpha to commit, thereby securing what she believes to be a new, impenetrable ""wall"". One which she can feel safe existing behind. ##God Doesn't Bleed You're an Alpha. You lift, your frame is solid and your game is good. You find a decent girl who's worth a damn and she becomes your LTR. Everything is going great. She fucks you like a pornstar, she cooks and cleans and takes care of you because you're scratching all her biological itches. You stand tall and proud. Nothing gets you down, because there isn't a problem on this blue Earth that you can't handle. In her eyes, you're a stone wall. A deep-rooted Oak. An untouchable God. Then, one day at work, you get injured. You've damaged the tendons in your feet badly, and walking has become excruciatingly painful, if even possible at times. The healing process will be long, and the chances for re-injury are very high. Eventually, your mood begins to sway. You can't do a lot of the things you used to love doing and you start feeling depressed. You can't back-squat anymore. Sometimes you can't even make it to the gym. Emotionally, you're a wreck. You don't feel like a man anymore, and all you want is someone to understand and to make you feel comfortable, even if just for a minute. So you turn to your LTR. Surely, after all you've done for her, she'll happily pick you up when you've fallen down. You open up to her, maybe you cried in frustration, or maybe you simply said ""this is too much for me to handle right now"". And just like that, with one simple display of weakness, you've shattered her illusion of safety around you. Apparently, you CAN be breached. There's a part of you that has deteriorated. It won't happen right away, but the process has already begun. She is losing interest in you, because there's now no 100% guarantee that this newfound ""weakness"" you have won't one day cause the entire wall to collapse. As I'm sure you figured out, since this example of an injury is oddly specific, that was what happened to me. My ""Soulmate"" lost all interest in me during my greatest time of need. She didn't dump me. I dumped her after I'd reached my breaking point. But it was simply a matter of time. I only beat her to the punch. Was I angry at the time? Of course. I thought the love and support I provided for her would be reciprocated, since I never asked for it other than just this one time. I was her God, and she watched me ask for help as I laid on the floor, bleeding in front of her. So she ceased to believe in me. I don't blame her. Not anymore. A big part of TRP is about accepting women for what they are, without hating them for it. I don't hate her for losing interest in me anymore than I'd hate a lion who attacked me for walking into its den. Both creatures were just doing what came to them naturally. Her biological imperative was to find a man who could protect her against the world and keep her safe from harm. How could I do that if I couldn't even protect myself from it? There's a difference between a woman seeing you injured and a woman seeing you broken, though. If you're stressed, but she knows you'll get through it, that's confirmation that although you both acknowledge the difficulty of the situation, it's a weight you can manage. If you have a mental breakdown and go off the deep end though, now you're broken. Even the strongest oak tree might bend and flex in the wind, but seeing the storm actually topple it over proves it wasn't as deep-rooted as initially perceived. Don't show her true vulnerability. Never let her see you broken. Bend and sway in the wind all you want. Ideally, the less, the better. But don't crumble. Don't fall over. Don't bleed. Be strong, resilient and adaptable. Safety is an illusion, and if you shatter that illusion, you lose all credibility in her eyes. That right there was the hardest fucking pill I ever had to swallow."

Its unnatural for women to be thinkers, builders, warriors, leaders. Dont hold women to the same standards you set for men. Dont judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree. (Einstein) When choosing the best woman, compare her to other women, not men. Otherwise you are bound to be disappointed. --- &amp;nbsp; Women are more agreeable and neurotic than men. Thats one of the reasons they may act like children, and sophisticated children are capable of hurting you while making you feel guilty for being hurt. Instead of doing something, they convince you to do it. Which is clever and even respectable  its one of the principles that lead people like Elon Musk or Richard Branson to success. Women didnt evolve to become stalwart, indomitable warriors. If they were capable of fighting alongside men (gather resources, build shelters, kill enemies, lead), would they need men? Would humanity where women are equal to men continue to exist? No, that would be a bloodbath, same as it has always been for men, except that now, since women are fighting and competing with men there would be no one left to bear children. And that is their purpose  children. They must begin that path until about 35 years of age. &amp;nbsp; Why encourage women to compete with men? Thats against their nature. The focus of their youth must be to build a family, not a career. If they miss that train, theyre going to be miserable for the rest of their life. I know one such woman. She had an abortion in her 20s which destroyed her reproductive system. Two decades later she is a sad alcoholic, riding cocks and CCs. Recently one of her boyfriends bought her a brand new SUV. Pretty nice considering shes over 45 years old. Either way she is unhappy and lonely despite being surrounded by white knights. &amp;nbsp; When for some reason youre expecting a woman to be competent, powerful, honorable  essentially a warrior, youre making a big mistake. Why do you expect her to be that? It is _your_ job as a man to be everything she is not. And also, _not_ be what she is. Because if youre cute, needy, sweet and romantic, why the hell would she want you? She already has all that within. Yin and yang. Youre the masculine (discipline, competence, strength), shes the feminine (freedom, beauty, vulnerability). Dont expect her to be like you, and dont expect her to want you if youre anything like her. &amp;nbsp; There is no reason to be proud that youre better than a woman at something. Nature designed you to strive for competence. How else are you going to be useful to yourself and civilization? Youre gonna bear and raise children? Sorry, that job is taken. &amp;nbsp; Leave the whining to women and children."
46,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Honesty is Not a Feminine Virtue [Long Post],53,7b4yr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7b4yr3/honesty_is_not_a_feminine_virtue_long_post/,2017-11-06 23:58:39,"""A man is only as good as his word."" ""You must always do what you say."" ""A real man never goes back on what he says."" Men are (should be) taught these things from young ages. Men value honesty, because men require honesty. Truth is essential for society to function. Society can not allow lying to be acceptable out of necessary agreement. Without truth and honesty there could be no trust, but most importantly if it is acceptable to lie, our words would be meaningless. Your real bros will tell you when you're fucked up. They'll tell you to shut up when you're out of place. They'll tell you the truth even if it's unpleasant. We men naturally avoid those whom we consider dishonest towards us, and perhaps consider our honesty a very personal gift to our listeners. Men can get along well when they are honest and direct with each other. The same cannot be said for women. Women are masters at deception. They paint a different face on everyday, change their style every other week, and chose their personality in the same way they do a coffee off the menu at Starbucks. If you are unfamiliar make sure you take a quick read/refresh of [The Manipulated Man](URL Women do not exist in *the real* as men do. Women do not value the truth as men do. Women do not even desire the truth as men do. Most importantly it is impossible for the truth to be a feminine virtue as the feminine is a master deceiver. **Women do not exist in reality:** A women with nothing to offer the world except a hole for rent will still believe that she blesses the earth that she walks on. Anytime something goes wrong within her life she will blame the results on external factors, ""Wow Chad was such an asshole, how could he break up with me? He just used me for sex?!"" and her friends will confirm her delusions, ""You're right girl you're perfect the way you are! You don't need to change for no man! They don't deserve you girl!"". This falsehood can only be maintained with strict aversion to the truth. For them to accept the truth they would have to admit the terrible things they do to themselves and others. Also, it is BP men that perceive these sorts of delusional statements from THOTS^THOTS^THOTS as objective truths, which they come to believe that their poor ONEitis^THOT has truly been taken advantage of instead of realizing that she is just a ho. **Women do not value the truth nor desire it:** If you told a women nothing but the truth this would bore her to death and dry up her pussy quicker than a nascar pit crew does a full service. This is because the truth is based in reality, and women do not live in reality. Perhaps you have wondered why women are so dramatic and exaggerative during their story telling? It is simple: Feelz before Realz. The truth does *feel* good. The truth isn't *entertaining*. The truth doesn't make her *hot*. It is **exaggeration, humor, and fantasy that do these things.** Women want to feel like they will suddenly become a better, more important person when they let you check their colon with your penis. They want to feel *fulfilled* when your cock is scratching that itch on the back of their throat. Most importantly, they want to feel *enlightened* when you pound them into orgasm with your rail rod. **Keeping a women in reality is boring to them. They want to live in fantasy.** **A master cannot have a virtue that contradicts their craft:** This part might be hard to conceptualize, so buckle up and grab your sippy-cup. If you haven't read [The Manipulated Man](URL yet go ahead and do so because this will go over your head if you haven't. Let's imagine a surgeon who exceptionally skilled at healing people. He is a master at his craft and performs and accomplishes even the most risky, difficult procedures. Is it possible for our surgeon to have a value that makes it impossible for him to execute his craft to help others? It is likely that he has values that dictate under what circumstances he performs his craft, he can have external factors dictate if he is able to perform his craft or not, but he cannot have internal values that make it impossible for him to perform surgery to heal others. The reason being is that in order become a master at a craft, you have to develop values that make it acceptable to practice, perfect, and execute it. If our surgeon had values that made it impossible to perform surgery, it would be impossible for him to become a master at such a trade. Of course us living in society approve of the master surgeon and encourage him to help others. However what if someone is a master at something we can not approve of as a society, such as a professional hitman? Things get a little bit harder to understand. It is possible for a hitman to disapprove of murder, while considering it acceptable. However a hitman (at least while working) cannot have values that make it impossible to commit murder, as this would also prevent such a person from being defined as a hitman. It is quite possible that the hitman could spontaneously develop values that did make it impossible to commit murder, at this point in time our hitman would no longer be considered a master as he is incapable of performing his craft. A hitman is a chosen profession, where as women are manipulators by default. The same way men are expendable by default, women are deceivers. To women manipulation is just a tool to ensure their own survival. The same way a man might view his strength or intellect to get what he wants, a women uses manipulation. That isn't to say women don't tell the truth, they do when it suits them, but they would tell a lie if it suit them better. They tell the truth out of necessity, not out of virtue, and as sparingly as possible. How many times have you gotten with/met a girl to learn she was insane only a few months(days/hours/minutes) later? Girls use manipulation to make themselves desirable, to make you think that fucking them exclusively is a good idea, and that trusting them with your thoughts and feelings is *okay*. They would never use something against you that you told them in a moment of vulnerability would they? I doubt it is possible but cannot prove that women cannot develop values that make it impossible to make it impossible to manipulate/deceive. Of course some are better than others at manipulation but this is not critical. **For a women to be able to use manipulation as a tool to get what she wants, Honesty cannot be a value for her, she can value honesty in others as this makes it easier to manipulate them, however she will never hold herself to the same standard of honesty**. Now I'm sure feminists are screaming their rainbow hair white by now and cursing me to death, but have a look at our modern society which has embraced the feminine. Deception is a common virtue. They have fooled themselves to the point where they think that women are still oppressed, the Nazi's have risen from their graves to oppress the free world, and that a man can become a women by simply chopping off his bratwurst. To speak against these deceptions is to become the greatest, darkest, and most unspeakable evil. &gt;""What an advantage a man would have if only he realised the cold, clear thoughts running through a womans head while her eyes are brimming with tears!

47,vulnerability,TheRedPill,How to Attract Women With Dominance Pt. 2- Conversational Leading,174,732g84,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/732g84/how_to_attract_women_with_dominance_pt_2/,2017-09-29 05:27:55," The man approaches the woman, the man generally must lead things forward physically (e.g. initiate the kiss), the man penetrates the woman in sex, and the man generally needs to lead the conversation. There are exceptions, some women like to be the aggressor in an interaction. However, expecting this to happen, or waiting to meet women who prefer to take this role will severely limit your results. Most women expect the man to take the responsibility in sexual interactions, and this just is what it is. Leading a conversation doesnt mean you must be domineering, it just means that its your responsibility to make sure the conversation hits the notes you want it to hit. You must give your conversations with women proper direction. Treat a conversation with a woman like a dance: if you dont take the initiative and lead it effectively, it wont go anywhere meaningful. In interactions with women, its your responsibility to build a sense of comfort, to avoid boring topics, to create an emotional charge, and to lead the interaction deeper to create emotional vulnerability. Conversation is an incredibly powerful tool, and with it, you can change how a woman feels about you, you can make her feel a deep connection with you, and you can make her sexually desire you. If you dont take the conversational initiative, chances are, the conversation wont go anywhere interesting or impactful. It will be a normal, surface-level exchange. Because of this, it is important that you change the topic if she goes down a conversational thread that isnt useful to your goals. For example, if she starts complaining about her job or her ex-boyfriends, cut her off, change the topic. Generally, you can do this with a light touch and simply say something like, Oh yeah, thats cool. Anyway, (then switch the topic to something more useful). Just change the topic and move on without paying it any mind. If a girl is insistent on talking about something that offers no value to a conversation, you may need to be more assertive and say something along the lines of, Im sorry, Im just not interested in talking about work drama. Im hanging out with you to have fun, and that kind of stuff isnt fun for me. Doing this is not only powerful because it helps set the tone of the interaction in a way thats useful to you, but also because its attractive when a man sets boundaries. As long as you do this without being bitter, it adds to the sexual tension. Sexual tension is created when people clash with and challenge each other; the sense of conflict adds a charge to an interaction whereas a purely nice and agreeable exchange is pleasant, but boring. **Decisive Language** Dominance is also communicated through your choice of language and tone of voice. The more assertive and decisive your language, the better. Imagine youre in bed with a girl, shes naked, and you said, Um, can I have sex with you now? Do you think that will get her hot and bothered? Fuck no. Imagine instead, you said, Im going to fuck you so hard right now. Im going to make you cum for me again and again. Thats more like it. (Sidenote: Telling a girl shes about to cum can actually make her cum.) So many men use qualifiers and ask for way too much permission. Assume permission until youre told no. Which is better? Asking a girl, Would you like to go to the dance floor? OR grabbing a girl by the hand and saying, Come with me. Men hesitate to be authoritative because theyre afraid it will get them rejected. The bitter irony here is that more often than not, pussyfooting around is what gets you rejected. Women are turned off by a man who doesnt have the balls to take what he wants. Even if a girl is initially attracted to you, if you act doubtful in any way, she will either assume youre not interested in her or she will lose interest You can find part 3, (How to be Man-To-Woman, here: URL "

She wants to know that she married a man with a solid frame who can withstand the storms of life. She wants to know that you are her ""rock"" as she may be, at times, the ocean crashing in on you, the rock. She wants you to crush these tests. **Shit Tests Vs. Bitchiness** Don't get shit tests and bitchiness mixed up. Shit tests are good - they are a sign that she is continually testing your fitness as a man, thus she is still interested in you. Crush those. Bitchiness is a sign that your leadership is lacking.... not always, but as a general rule. Sometimes she just might be bitchy for other reasons. Don't react in any case. Learn to recognize the difference between these 2 - very important. **The Real Issue; Leadership** While these are rather simplistic views on how to decipher a shit test and a comfort test, often the point is missed if the commenter is merely identifying what it is and not looking at the bigger picture. The bigger picture is leadership. That being said, leadership is brought up, leadership is (Owning Your shit) OYS or not. In other words, instead of merely identifying what type of test is being thrown out, when these tests arrive, it should be an opportunity to look at your leadership as the captain, and it is often an indicator of whether or not you are OYS. Reinforce the Positive Behaviors Then, the question becomes, are you a captain who rewards desirable behaviors and doesn't reward undesirable behaviors of the oldest teenager in the house, or are you just a shipmate who is reactive and scared to the needs, whims, emotions, and tides of the ocean, your wife. This is where the BP guys in the real world emasculate their self, and talk about how they have to ask ""boss."" The ""boss"" or their wife is an ocean of emotions that they are terrifyingly reacting instead of taking control of the helm and navigating the ship. It is a result of their BP conditioning. So, when the wife comes to you with serious bitchiness, and you decide that giving her a hug is the right answer, you are only reinforcing the negative behaviors that you are trying to avoid. You are not being a captain. When you can learn how to withdraw your presence when she is being harpy (in a non butt hurt manner), you are not rewarding the harpy behaviors anymore. Instead, you are removing a valuable asset that a man has in a relationship: your time and presence. **Comfort Tests, Leadership, and Vulnerability** On the flip side of the coin, as you learn to not reward undesirable behaviors and instead treat them with amused mastery because it is silly when she tries to get a reaction from you, you genuinely find it amusing. Guys get confused by thinking AM is an action. It is an internalized attitude. Its called amused mastery because you are genuinely amused once your frame internalizes from a position of strength. Then, when a real comfort test comes along when your wife has just had a week from hell, and she comes to you with her head hanging, she might say ""I've had such a rough week, and I'm so emotionally drained,"" that is a metric that your leadership might be on the right course. In other words, instead of coming at you bitchy because she's had a horrible week, she comes to you humbly because she knows that she can be vulnerable with the captain, and the captain will comfort her. Vulnerability shown by your wife is a sign of trust and a sign that she is accepting your leadership. If she doesn't trust entering your frame because you have no frame and you are a weak ass bitch who is just going to make the situation worse, then she will come at you bitchy instead of vulnerably. When this happens, it is a revelation in the RP man's life. **Be the Container** Bottom line is when you have done the work and you become the best man that you can be, then, and only then will you have a strong container that can fill the water from the waves crashing into you, the rock. This is genuine frame that only comes with hard consistent work. Turn that water into wine. Don't get all hung up in terms of comfort, fitness, bitchiness, A&amp;A, AM... etc. Look at the bigger picture. Look at your leadership and the continued development of your leadership. Search and find your own barometers for your leadership as the captain. Know your first mate. Have fun. Enjoy your life. It's yours to enjoy. Vision: Big Picture Perspective Look at the forest (lifting, diet, OYS, leadership, frame, dread.. Etc.. Don't stand there and stare at 2 or 3 trees (identifying tests) and dissect the hell out of them. Don't be autistic and look for the magic wand solution like a dime store magician . Be the best man you can be, and the leadership will come naturally, and your life will start to become much more fulfilling because it won't be filled with bitchiness. Your life will be filled with internal satisfaction, and that will give you the leadership to comfort and make life better for your family and friends. It will give you the vital shift in perspective and consciousness that symbolizes the road back to masculinity and being the best man you can be. "
50,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Your Vulnerabilities Cannot Be Related to Her or Another Man,148,6wjwy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6wjwy4/your_vulnerabilities_cannot_be_related_to_her_or/,2017-08-29 01:00:15,"Women like an emotional roller-coaster. They desire variance. It keeps the story line interesting. One of those variances is vulnerability. In most cases, you don't want to reveal any vulnerabilities for a one-night stand or a plate. She wants a strong guy with a hard dick who isn't intimidated her and passes her shit-tests. Nothing more. But for girls who you want to convert into an LTR, showing some vulnerability can engage their motherly instincts (remember, women are *both* whores and mothers; bloops think they're all nice, nurturers who could never do wrong, and anger phase men think they're only and always whores - both are wrong). I suggest only doing this after you've fucked her or if somewhere along the initial seduction you were too much of an asshole, sent her into auto-rejection, and need some attainability. Vulnerability can make you human again, where now she only sees you as a cold robot or rampaging asshole. But when you do show her this vulnerability, there's one iron rule: **it cannot be about her.** Why? *Because she can't help with you with it.* Maybe you had a rough childhood and an abusive father, because your mother died and he became a raging alcoholic. You tell her that and she will want to give you that motherly love you never had. If you've already given her good dick, not only does she feel sexual attraction to you but she can nurture you, too. Her full feminine nature is magnetized. Also, this will explain *why* you're such a hardass. ""Oh, he's a dick because he's a hurt little boy inside!"" Now she rationalizes your bad behavior and will therefore forgive it. She will let you be sarcastic, cold, or whatever quality that makes you emotionally unavailable and not blame you for it. A woman who makes excuses for your behavior is hooked. Think of the reverse and you will understand - think about how the most hopelessly enslaved one-itis sufferers are men who make excuses for a girl's shitty behavior. This *reinforces* their addiction, since they're rationalizing away reasons why they should cut her off. Same mechanism. Vulnerability amplifies her addiction. And it's good, too, because she *wants someone to take care of.* It keeps her interested. Good cock only goes so far. But if your vulnerability is related to her, you're doomed. No matter how much she tries to prove to you with words or actions that she cares for you, loves you, etc., it will never satisfy whatever insecurity you have, because it's coming from the source of your doubt. Eventually, she will grow to resent the insecurities you have surrounding her, not only because women despise weakness, but because she can't help you with this, and her nurturing nature won't be released. Beyond the implicit or explicit conversation that you have at some point about her being sexually faithful with zero exceptions, there should never be another talk about her commitment to you. If her interest in your life mission wavers at any point, you need to address it any other way other than expressing your doubts about her commitment to your cause. Otherwise, drop her. There can be no conversation regarding your insecurities about her. Or another man. It may not be objectively true that you are the greatest man in the world, but you damn well better act like it and feel it emotionally. If another man is the source of your life troubles, like a business rival, your only conversations with her regarding him should be about how you can destroy him. Otherwise, she will see him as your superior and be attracted to him. Other than that, most vulnerabilities will draw her in to your story and reinforce her addiction to you and your cock. "
51,vulnerability,TheRedPill,"10 priceless lessons after 10 years in the manosphere [5-min read, x-post from r/MensRights]",252,6z841d,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6z841d/10_priceless_lessons_after_10_years_in_the/,2017-09-10 23:02:31,"Im a moderate, science-oriented guy who encountered the mens part of the internet right before becoming an adult and spent lots of time on tracking its development throughout the nuances of ideological conflicts. I talked a lot to people representing diverse perspectives, checked the literature so you (mostly) dont have to and summarized top lessons. **Heres my take-away message that will help you avoid surprisingly common and serious mistakes the manosphere readers make.** **1. Strive to become the [steelmanned](URL version of a MGHOW.** * While the Mens Rights Movement struggles to change the existing system governing gender relationships and The Red Pill tries to exploit it with varying degrees of moral responsibility, Men Going Their Own Way opt out of the parts of the system failing the cost-benefit and risk-benefit analyses. It is also the most important move, giving you a sense of agency. * The game is mostly rigged. For most men, it is advisable not to marry and [not to have kids](URL ([they also probably wouldnt make you happier](URL Check local regulations to avoid falling into the common law marriage, secure financial assets, as well as regularly collect and secure extensive evidence against any false accusations. If its too late for these things, focus on the possible damage control. Take few hours to evaluate your personal situation and think of all the possible failure modes, rank them by probability, list preventive measures and take them. * Dont fall into the vitriolic, low-quality content flooding the MGTOW community; I know its perceived as a hospital for the wounded, but the low-effort submissions are just devaluing the core message. Dont become the 30-40 year-old version of the edgy, socially awkward kid from the high school. Seeking external justification for being frustrated because you still struggle with the anger phase just perpetuates the problem. * Dont cross out the possibility of entering a long-term, supportive relationship; if youre a decent person, you absolutely deserve the health and well-being benefits it offers. And if you happen to be in one, dont get overly paranoid or obsessed with the power balance: dedicate 30 minutes each week for a worry and checkup session to reflect on the dynamics and identify potential problems/risks you can address. **2. Enjoy the bulk benefits of self-improvement.** * Things that contribute positively to your Sexual Market Value greatly overlap with things that improve the overall quality of life. * Even if you stay (in)voluntarily celibate, pay for sexual services and/or gave up dating, there is no excuse for not taking care of your mental and physical health, shape, presence, body language, persuasiveness, education, financial stability, peer network and various passions. Lifes too short and fragile to be small. * Non-neediness is often presented as the top attractive quality. The obvious paradox is that the more you want something or somebody, the more youre needy about it. You cant fake it or display it through vulnerability when your life is off the proper track. Treat non-neediness as an emergent phenomenon which manifests partially due to the genuine and high self-esteem combined with inner philosophical peace, and partially because of other aspects of a sorted and fulfilling life. * SMV has little or nothing to do with your value as a human being. There are hundreds of embarrassing celebrities with high SMVs who do not bring anything constructive to the world. If youre a conscientious nerd, youre at least on the top of the IQ distribution, the most powerful force in the universe you can use to make it a better place. Get a proper perspective despite the social pressures. **3. Manosphere subreddits and networks offer rapidly diminishing returns.** * Learning the accurate core message and internalizing it by sincerely and completely resolving the so-called anger phase is 90% of success. * Most of the things you can read in daily submissions are basically the re-iteration of already made observations. The amount of poor anecdotal evidence and bias usually translates into the low signal-to-noise ratio. * The NoFap community is at least controversial. When it comes to the excessive masturbation and pornography use, there is no clear scientific consensus; [most of reasonable voices](URL state that they become a problem if interfering with everyday life or indicating other underlying issues (neuroticism, violence, social isolation, need for a super-intense stimulation). Given this argument and the overwhelming presence of sexual content in a modern world, it might be good to find a compromise and dedicate two time slots in a week, one for masturbation and one for viewing softcore erotica. This should reconcile releasing the sexual tension and keeping things under control. * Youre likely stuck on the outrage porn/manosphere content because a) its kind of addictive, b) you have [the fear of missing out](URL According to the [efficient market hypothesis](URL if theres something surprising, posing a significant threat or giving you a real advantage, youll quickly hear about it. * Limit yourself to reading critically few core books - Mate by Geoffrey Miller and Tucker Max, Models by Mark Manson, The Rational Male series by Rollo Tomassi and The Red Pill Handbook - as well as top 20 posts of all time from each manosphere subreddit. Make notes and apply the knowledge. [Form lasting habits](URL Then, unless youre a paid activist or volunteer, exit (thanks for making one exception for this post ;)) and limit time spent in the manosphere to maximum 15 minutes each week. In most cases, gender issues are not worth more time. If youre super-inclined towards raising awareness, take 1 hour each week to deliver the tailored message to good men and/or people in positions of power who many influence the course of things. Set non-negotiable time constraints or youll end up overwhelmed with the negative emotions. **4. Traditional conservatives (TradCons) are mostly right about one thing.** * If we could have a really effective matching algorithm (taking genetics, personality, interests and life circumstances into account) and globally re-instantiate the philosophically or religiously motivated marriage 1.0 as a default, legally supported option for 80-90% of people, it could easily solve dozens of individual and social issues with relatively few manageable downsides. It would probably be a near-optimal solution. * As you might expect, its a purely theoretical concept. When even the marriage 2.0 is in decline, we need to develop a new framework, probably on the basis of consensual non-monogamy. Unfortunately, there are countless problems with managing this type of relationships, the world of polyamory deepens existing female advantage and is almost entirely dominated by radical left-wing ideologues, so hypothetical adjustments are going to take years. The bottom line is that we dont have a sustainable, systemic model fo the long-term relationships in the 21st century, and I wouldnt expect to see the assortative polyamory adjusted with game theory and (evolutionary) psychology any time soon. **5. Gender relationships are coordination problems.** * Many of the gender issues are enclosed in zero-sum games, many are not. We should aim for the fair division of desired resources in zero-sum games and focus on creating non-zero-sum games (win-win deals). We shouldnt think so much about particular individuals but about the structure of systems (dont hate the player, hate the game). These considerations are far more complicated than most of us think, so learn about the [evolution of cooperation](URL * Steelmanned, evidence-driven versions of liberal (second wave) feminism and mens rights movement are generally compatible and could jointly lead towards increased cooperativeness. There is a lot of potential for improving the quality of discussion, introducing better standards (like agreeing on arguing in the collaborative truth-seeking mode, using [the Ideological Turing Test](URL spotting [cognitive biases](URL and sophisticated manipulation techniques. Remember that two wrongs dont make a right, so harming the other side because youre disadvantaged in a different domain is ultimately counterproductive. Individually, you sometimes have to opt out of the unjust settings. Sooner or later, decent people will follow. * Third wave feminism and manosphere are similar to playing defect in [the iterated social version of the prisoner's dilemma](URL either offensively or in defense. It likely leads to [the tragedy of the commons](URL and the social isolation becomes [a major threat to public health](URL As you can see, social dynamics are extremely complex and subject to many variables, so debates over who started the fire are rather pointless. Unfortunately, Im not really sure when and how we can eventually stop this self-perpetuating insanity. * We should legally ostracize/penalize bad people (and bad ideas) violating the principles of a well-adjusted cooperative framework. It might be tempting to focus on taking advantage in the power game as often as possible, but its not a sustainable solution (youre acting like the [greedy algorithm](URL and [evoking backfire](URL Do not become the demon you fight. * Associating oneself openly with the mens right movement will almost automatically label you a sexist misogynist and exclude you from the dominating circles which perpetuate rigged games. Youre going to have more positive impact if you present yourself as an independent, smart moderate or a member of the dominating in-group who points out towards specific mens problems. Use [the Fabian strategy](URL by raising awareness from the bottom-up and emphasizing the contradictions of [the postmodern social justice cult](URL If in doubt, always [keep your identity small](URL * Anonymously support cost-effective, high-quality mens initiatives with you money and/or advice. * Theres also a request for mens groups: prepare handouts addressing the most important topics, so that the censorship of mens problems loses its effectiveness. Prepare weekly or monthly newsletters with the condensed message on global and local mens issues, so that men wouldnt have to spend hours in the manosphere constantly trying to look for new threats. **6. Actual misogyny backfires.** * Some women are horrible, many or most of them benefit from the ideological bias which is often openly exploited. Some of negative traits are also more prevalent among women than men, so we can consider them as many aspects of the toxic femininity archetypes. * Having said that, never end up bitter and victimized for the sake of your own mental health. Dont scan the environment constantly searching for the minor examples of oppression that go well with your confirmation bias. Thats how the third wave feminists generally feel, no matter if they experience more or less real oppression. While its very risky to be done in a direct manner, some of them will change their mind if you politely show them counter-evidence. Most of the anti-male ideologies are also self-contradicting, so they slowly devour their own believers. Dont overly stigmatize people confused by the absurdities of culture wars or victims of the ideological brainwashing, as long as they dont attack you directly. Name and shame cynical ideologues who treat them instrumentally in order to reach their own goals. * Dont stay resentful towards women. Some cooperate, trying to transgress their specific advantages and see the other side, some live genuinely productive, admirable lives and deserve to be rewarded. Think of mothers in difficult situations, female Doctors Without Borders, talented scientists, artists and simply kind girls from the neighborhood. Manosphere largely deals with the sexual strategy and its social implications, and while this sphere is extremely important, it certainly doesnt cover all the human interactions. Attention-seeking middle class Instragram wannabe models might be extremely privileged, while depressed and sensitive girls taking care of their sick siblings are not. Do not dehumanize women even if you feel it numbs you to games they often play. * You cant opt out of the sexual strategies and dynamics, but authentic relationships are about coordination and suspending these games as much as possible. Theres a thin line between the Game and subtle emotional abuse, which, more often than not, backfires. **7. Beware of the fake alpha and anxious-avoidant traps.** * Always consider that you might be acting like or striving to become a fake alpha. Its a particularly sneaky trap, so consider the likely underlying mechanism  [a co-dependent/narcissist trap](URL (it also perfectly explains the state of the PUA scene). * Some of the manosphere readers try to equalize being beta with the anxious attachment style, and being alpha with the secure or avoidant style. Then they try to change their innate attachment styles and bond with wrong people, which usually ends up with a horror story. [Dont do this.](URL * If theres a feminine-like or sensitive part of you, dont try to forcefully change it. Instead, understand it better from [the informed perspective](URL **8. Manosphere is not a cure for existential crises.** * Many of the frustrations expressed in the manosphere actually refer to big picture issues like mortality, finding life purpose, dealing with the better and worse angels of our human nature, as well as resolving the problem of pleasure and attachment. It might be better to seek answers in the contemporary approaches to the ancient wisdom included in Eastern philosophies (especially Buddhism) and Stoicism. * As much as you hate to admit it, youre quite likely to have an unresolved psychological issue or a disorder. And as much as you dont want to admit it, you may perceive the things through the faulty lens. Check out these great guides about [depression](URL and [anxiety](URL * If youre looking for the meaning in measurable and practical terms, consider joining the [Effective Altruism movement](URL and [the associated blogosphere](URL Its still far from the Platonic ideal, but at least it has reasonable priors, gathers interesting people and actually changes the world. **9. Take a big picture view on the numbers games.** * Even if some of the dating market dynamics (such as the open hypergamy) perpetuate cruel inequalities with many negative implications, there are still outliers. Even if you are incapable of solving the systemic problem, you can drastically increase your changes by sticking out from the crowd and maximizing the number of interactions you have within the most promising niches. It requires much more time-consuming work, so focus on weeding out incompatible people as fast as possible. If you can achieve it, things look much brighter: Archetypal Chad: 1 000 interactions * 30% mutual interest = 300 dates * 1% strong compatibility = 3 close relationships Archetypal Beta Normie: 30 000 interactions * 1% mutual interest = 300 dates * 1% strong compatibility = 3 close relationships **10. Embrace optimism and mystery.** * While being a man in the world of a post-rational discourse is kind of depressing, [humanity as a whole seems to be heading in a good direction](URL You may not be able to feel it directly, but many important things are getting better. * There is a growing number of reasonable people leaving the arms race of the Red Tribe hijacked by alt-right/neoreactionaries and the Blue Tribe hijacked by control-left/postmodernists. Seek for or establish your local Grey Tribe communities defined by nuance, moderation, compassion and everyday kindness. * Despite all the research and conventional wisdom, love (or, if you prefer, the mate choice) is still a mysterious entity. Up until now, [no-one has been able to fully understand the nature of romantic infatuation](URL (even with [the recent use of machine learning](URL and if the day of truth finally comes, its likely going to help us in leading more fulfilling lives.

52,vulnerability,TheRedPill,The Five Most Useful Resources for Learning Pickup,88,6zbvy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6zbvy0/the_five_most_useful_resources_for_learning_pickup/,2017-09-11 10:04:19,"**Theres more pickup content available now then anyone could ever need. Unfortunately, a lot of that content is garbage. In fact, even some of the most popular Youtube channels and writers on the subject dont have any clue what theyre talking about. (check out pickup decoded for an example of this)** &amp;nbsp; Ive been actively practicing pickup for five years now. Ive read all the books, watched all the videos, and bought all the products. When thinking about what content I came across that really made an impact, theres a few things that stand out. I want to share with you those nuggets of gold buried beneath the mountain of bullshit so that you can accelerate your results. &amp;nbsp; **Books** &amp;nbsp; **Models by Mark Manson** URL &amp;nbsp; Probably the most talked about seduction book on Reddit, and for good reason. This book isnt about techniques to trick a girl into sleeping with you, its about becoming a man of value who women will want to sleep with. I disagree with a few the points in the book, but for the most part its a lot of very solid mindset advice. After reading this book you will think differently about women and sexuality, in a way that will open a lot of doors for you (the sections about vulnerability and womens desire to be desired are particularly interesting). Highly recommended. &amp;nbsp; **The Trial: transform your dating life in eight weeks by Avery Hayden** URL &amp;nbsp; This is a shorter book, what I particularly like about it, is that its 100% action based. It teaches concepts about attraction, mindsets, etc. But this book is like a p90x for dating more than anything. Its a step-by-step process you can follow to get your dating life handled. &amp;nbsp; What stands out is that the challenges are well thought out, and the book teaches you how to learn from your pickup sessions effectively. In fact, it gives examples of a student going through the process, and its kind of like youre going through the challenges with them. Very cool idea, and I recommend this book because its very important to have structure around this, otherwise its very easy to go months or even years without making real progress (as Ive seen happen to many, many guys). &amp;nbsp; The Art of Seduction by Robert Greene URL &amp;nbsp; This book is incredibly well written, and it is fascinating. Its not so much about how to sleep with someone, as it is a book about how to make people fall in love. It uses powerful historical examples to illustrate how to really get people to invest in you. &amp;nbsp; Ive read this book at least 6 times, and I have to say of all the books Ive read this is the one book thats challenged my assumptions about how people tick more than any other. &amp;nbsp; The Videos &amp;nbsp; Frankly, a lot of the pickup channels on YouTube are cringey, theres only a few channels that are really worth diving into. &amp;nbsp; However, there are a few videos that are not only mind blowing, but capable of making a real difference in how you approach game. &amp;nbsp; The first one is: URL &amp;nbsp; This video is by the infamous Julien Blanc, and although its relatively short, it makes a very important point. Essentially, Julien explains that pickup is largely a self-fulfilling prophecy: if you believe you are attractive, women will feel that off you, and theres a much higher chance they will be attracted to you. If you believe youre unattractive, girls will feel that off of you, and run for the hills. &amp;nbsp; This video gives you a very practical strategy for intentionally mindfucking yourself into believe you are more attractive, so that- by extension- girls find you more attractive. &amp;nbsp; Tylers six steps to a consistently killer night: URL &amp;nbsp; This video lays out a very specific process you can follow when you go out so that you are not only very likely to have success with women, but also to have a great time in the process. &amp;nbsp; The video basically teaches you how to get in what psychologists call a flow state, and having used these steps for years now, I can say with confidence that there is real merit to these steps. &amp;nbsp; FIND WINGS &amp;nbsp; Its hypothetically possible to learn pickup on your own, but its not something Ive ever seen happen. Having wings is really helpful, especially when youre new. Even if youve never approached a girl, when you start hanging out with guys who do approach girls, youll start to feel pressured to do so because the people around you are doing it: peer pressure at its finest. Surrounding yourself with people with similar goals and motivations is extremely powerful, and theres really no excuse to not have some wings you know to go out with. With the internet its not hard to find wings, theres an inner circle group for every major city that you can join. Then you message people on the group or post to the page to start going out with people. Some of them will be weirdos, some will suck, but others will be genuinely cool dudes who are really trying to get this area of their life handled. TO find these groups on facebook, just look up: RSD Inner circle  Your city. Personally, I tried to learn this on my own, but I failed pretty hard until I met some wings. Those are, in my opinion, some of the best resources for learning game, check them out, let me know what you think. (And if theres something you think that needs to be on the list that Ive omitted feel free to suggest it) "
53,vulnerability,TheRedPill,CASE STUDY OF A MOTHERFUCKING COVERT NARCISSIST,72,6znq1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6znq1n/case_study_of_a_motherfucking_covert_narcissist/,2017-09-13 01:35:44,"Dear Red Pillers, I have been quiet for some time, having made the decision to a little less reading and a little more application in my life of RP principles. However, I have recently had the opportunity to watch some rather conniving shit go down. And like in many conspiracy movies out there, when I, for myself, tried to uncover some truth, for the sake of my own sanity, I was blown away at how wired the system was to shut me the fuck up. Before I get into the details, allow me to say that yes, my vulnerability to this situation has been a loss of frame in some respects. But if any of you out there have ever dealt with a true to blood narcissist, you will understand that they have a way of insidiously leaching their shit into your life, to a point where you start to notice that weird and shitty glances are being shot your way, from people who were basically your friends in the not too recent past. A covert narcissist will spend an inordinate of time and effort breaking your world down around you, in order to create a climate that is ultimately conducive to their fucking dysfunction. Also, I need to clarify, that this particular brand of narcissism of which I speak, is really, in my own opinion not akin to the kind of dark triad personality trait that is so often lauded here is TRP. True covert NPD represents overcompensation for many perceived and real shortcomings of the individual that is afflicted. In reality, the individual afflicted is anything but RED, and given that the individual in question is a woman, perhaps that is a point that is only partially relevant. I have been living with a woman, for almost a year at this point. She is a recently acquired flat mate, lets call her Wendy, who moved in after my last flat mate (also a woman) left. I know her through a bigger group of friends, and when my last flat mate moved out she expressed interest in living with me. Her boyfriend is an acquaintance of mine, though I would not say that we are friends. I have been into TRP for almost 4 years now, and I would say that the last 2 have been amazing years. Though up until recently, I was still holding onto the idea of marriage and kids, but what I have experienced recently has really made me question that. When she moved in in October last year, the first few months were great. Youre always gonna get shit tests, but I held frame, threw in a little blue to keep her comfortable, and life went on well. I found that this combo worked well for my previous flat mate as well. So, Wendy has a long distance relationship, with the dude named James. He lives a few thousand miles away, six foot two, managing director for his local branch of a research group. Good looking, high earning, and beta as fuck. I also found out, through a mutual friend that James had previously been married, and that she had basically systematically broken down their marriage. Based on what I have heard, she went to enormous lengths to paint the guys ex-wife as a crazy abusive piece of shit. By the time the affair started, and he was motioning to leave his wife, the people in their group of friends (chicks and beta fucks) were basically encouraging him to do so. leave that crazy bitch, go find true happiness. I now know that the reality was the complete opposite. His ex was about as good a woman as can be expected, given what we know about women anyway. His second child was only 6 months old when the affair started. Now I understand that sexual strategy is amoral, but jesus fuck, I have a particular dislike for those who fuck with the well-being of young families. So, Wendy is quite pretty, HB7 without makeup, HB8+ with make-up, good outfit etc. Guys hit on her all the time, coming over, buying her shit, taking her on trips. She fucks none of them. Not fucking one. Not fucking a single one. Until recently. She met and became friends with a doctor, and he eventually became her doctor, prescribing meds and all kinds of shit. Has his own practices, beta as fuuuuuuuuuuuuck. Has a wife, two kids, one of which is recently turned one years old. Now this is kinda where I fucked up. After a few weeks of James coming around, I expressed my concern. It was something along the lines ofYou are almost done with your professional degree, in a few months you will have the world at your feet, not to mention that there are tons of single guys after you. Why would you go after this dude? And fuck, what about James back home, who left his wife and kids for you?. In the moment that I said that I could see her mood shift. From the next day onwards, her energy toward me had completely shifted. Nothing has been the same since. But it gets worst. I left for a few months to undertake a course at a nearby institution, and was gone for 3 months. When I came back, I got the full on, full blown insanity treatment. I was met with extreme disregard, and for a short while I was under the impression that she had slipped into a depressive episode. Which was also true, but only part of the bigger story. In the time that I was gone, Wendy had gone into full attack mode, to lock down this new doctor. Blowjobs in the car, anal sex, the whole fucking deal. Yes, I have been eavesdropping for the last few weeks, out of sheer curiosity and disgust. At the same time she is stonewalling her current boyfriend James, and is preparing to break up with him. Only, she is not breaking up with him directly, she is simultaneously engaging in a campaign of painting him as an abusive cunt, whilst saying things to him to piss him off. When things end, they will end very badly for James. He will defend himself, calling out Wendy for her bullshit, only by then Wendy will have prepped a mob of SJWs to defend her when this happens. The reason for my eavesdropping, is because, having arrived home to such a clusterfuck of a household, I was worried. Also, because a mutual acquaintance approached me, concerned, that I had been Treating Wendy like a piece of shit, and that I better think carefully about what I am doing.. I dont think Wendy wanted him to talk to me, but he was white knighting, for whatever reason I dont know. A little more careful digging and I find out that she was also building a wall of bullshit aimed at me. Creating a conducive atmosphere for when she finally manages to separate this doctor dude from his wife and kids. Did I mention that I have only 6 month left on my program, and pretty soon Im gonna be the fuck out of here. Just need to make it through the next six months. Anyway, so I have spent the last few weeks, gathering any and all evidence that I can, and I have collected quite a fuckload. I have also compiled a statement, together with some evidence, and I have left this with the in house HR shrink (who is bound by confidentiality) and another copy with program manager whom I report to in my study program. I have sought professional advice on doing this, to make sure my bases are covered, so no worries here, I am good. In the event anything comes my way, I am prepared to nuke all kingdom come from high heaven, and to do so through official channels. I have also since changed my stance on the whole doctor thing, I encourage her to follow her heart, and have suggested double dates and such. The last while has been okay, in a practical living sense. And then last week this happened Two weeks ago, she started receiving threatening anonymous emails and phone calls. And not random, stupid, emails and phone calls, I gather by how things are going that someone is engaging in a systematic program of annihilation against her, with evidence. It seems to be designed to expose her. She is melting the fuck down, and has even asked me for help (She of course states that these are completely unrelated to Dr guy). Which, ironically has made my living life a whole lot better. It is pissing her the fuck off and it is a pleasure for me to watch. But do you think she has stoppedno completely the opposite. She is doubling down on her efforts to branch swing. I suspect this is going to get nasty. I got my end covered, so Im good.if I need to I can move out in a moment. Just gonna sit back and watch the show. The best part, is that Wendy is a professional social worker who spends her days advocating for the rights of mothers and children. "

I will start off by saying I am definitely a beginner, I have my issues which I am aware of and I am trying to work on them. I found this place 6 months ago(don't remember when exactly), at the same time I decided to come out of my shell and become the person I envisioned myself to really be. Around 2 months ago, when I hit my weight goal and started to get really positive feedback from society, I felt on top of the world for a while. But something was missing, after long self reflection I realised I am very much over-invested in other people's opinions, and thus have a really deep fear of rejection. I realised I tried to raise my SMV to high enough levels that I will not be required to do the approaching and instead harvest the goods. This came as a huge insight into my life, and it helped my realise that one of the big issues I have is no real contact with women beside irrelevant mediums(work/ commute aka train). I met a woman recently and we are now FWB(It was initiated by her), and I can't help but feel like this is not a good situation for me. I feel like I am seeking validation on a deep level tha't wasnt there before, and it might be related to the FWB, or I am just feeling down these past few days, or maybe it's the realisation that I need to get around more to actually meet women, but it's been hard for me. I just can't understand what it is im seeking currently, I have regular sex, I have friends (albeit not enough social circles and definitely not enough women), I have a good paying job and a good future. When i first met my FWB I had a crush on her, couldn't stop thinking of her and couldn't eat and shit, but after witnessing AWALT all those feeling shattered instantly, and I felt empty for a while until swallowing the hard truth. Maybe I am seeking that rush, and I will forget about it with time? I realise this is huge progress for me. Having a FWB plus obviously having a much higher SMV than I did months ago, and also realising my goals and directions in life is a huge step up. Holding a strong frame while showing true vulnerability, alongside not being afraid to show desire or appear flirtatious, and not giving a fuck about anyone, is really a tough journey. I am venting regularly (journal) and am really enjoying life(usually), and I wanted to see your opinions as I feel overwhelmed currently. I appreciate every one that read patiently, and powered through my not so coherent writing."
55,vulnerability,TheRedPill,"Forget What You Think You know About Women, Dating, and Attraction",25,6ockq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6ockq7/forget_what_you_think_you_know_about_women_dating/,2017-07-20 10:01:05,"The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.- Socrates &amp;nbsp; **If you want an abundant dating life full of exciting experiences with women of the highest quality, the first essential step is something you probably wouldnt have guessed. Develop intellectual humility.** &amp;nbsp; Seriously? &amp;nbsp; Seriously. We all have beliefs about ourselves, women, and society that we have developed and reinforced over the course of years of development. Many of these beliefs are flat out wrong and are preventing you from getting what you want. &amp;nbsp; If youre not prepared to change your beliefs about yourself and about what women respond to, you will find yourself swimming against the current because more than anything, its our beliefs that prevent us from getting the success with women we want. &amp;nbsp; Imagine that you believe that you arent attractive to women because youre not in particularly good shape. Regardless, youve decided to read some dating advice content because you found it interesting and youre willing to do anything to get a girlfriend. &amp;nbsp; Okay, youve read some dating advice and feel inspired to take some action. Lets say you approach five women a day for two weeks. &amp;nbsp; Your interactions for these two weeks dont really go anywhere. For the most part you have polite conversations with girls that last a few minutes; you dont get any girls numbers and you certainly dont sleep with any attractive women. &amp;nbsp; This is to be expected because youre new to this. Unfortunately, because youre convinced that physical fitness is what attracts women, you filter your results through this belief. You tell yourself that if you were ripped you wouldnt have gotten rejected by all the women you approached. You tell yourself that youre wasting your time approaching a bunch of women while out of shape, and that you need to focus on getting your fitness handled before you approach more women. &amp;nbsp; What you dont know is that your brain is extremely clever and it will do anything it can to help you avoid painful experiences. Going out and approaching women is anxiety provoking and uncomfortable for you at this point, especially because you dont have any results to show for the effort youve expended. Your brain doesnt want you to go through this pain anymore. &amp;nbsp; So, your brain convinces you that you need to be ripped before you do more approaches. This rationalization allows you to avoid the painful experience of approaching women while still allowing you to feel like youre making progress by going to the gym. &amp;nbsp; When dissected from a third person perspective, its easy to see that this kind of thinking is delusional, but its not so easy to do the same with your own delusional beliefs. We all have delusions about ourselves and about human psychology. Its inevitable that we pick up some misguided beliefs over the years, it would be arrogant to think you have a perfectly accurate view of reality. &amp;nbsp; Because of our vulnerability to delusion the key to self-improvement is to be open-minded to the possibility that your beliefs are inaccurate and to be prepared to let go of any of your current beliefs. &amp;nbsp; **Why Our Beliefs About Women Are So Inaccurate** &amp;nbsp; In the first world (and especially in America), we live in a narcissistic culture. This is neither good nor bad, but being raised in such a culture will inevitably affect the filter through which you view reality. &amp;nbsp; In this narcissistic culture, we give extreme value to appearances. We associate beauty and wealth with success and happiness. Youve been taught throughout your life that women want men with money, status, and good looks. &amp;nbsp; To a degree, this is true, (especially in a culture where women are taught they should want these things) money, status, and good looks are all attractive. But, its not all women respond to. &amp;nbsp; Even if you arent good looking or wealthy, with enough confidence you can attract plenty of beautiful women. The problem is that it can be difficult to believe this is possible when youve been through a lifetime of conditioning that has taught you to focus on external factors like money or looks. &amp;nbsp; Yes, being good looking helps grease the wheel, but self-confidence is more viscerally powerful than any individual external factor. &amp;nbsp; Furthermore, good looking people tend to be more self-confident than their less attractive counterparts. We assume good looking people get more results with women because of their looks, but what if its actually because of the self-confidence that is associated with those qualities? &amp;nbsp; Think about it. Its easier to feel entitled to attractive women if youve been told that youre good looking your whole life. We instinctively assume its the good looks that leads to success, but maybe its mostly the entitlement good-looking people have from years of positive reinforcement. Good looking guys expect women to like them so they arent afraid to ask the hot girls out or make bold moves. Maybe this is why its easy for them to get the results they want. (Obviously, this isnt black and white, there are a lot of good looking guys who arent confident and who dont get results with women.) &amp;nbsp; This isnt to say that good looks dont help, but that our perception of how attraction works is based on a lot of assumptions. Some may be accurate, some may be flat out wrong. But if you dont question and challenge these assumptions, they can hold you back forever. &amp;nbsp; If you tie an animal in captivity to a rope for its entire life, it will become accustomed to the boundaries the rope limits it to. If, after years of captivity, you take off the rope, but leave the animal in the same physical space, the animal wont leave the area that the rope used to constrain it to. &amp;nbsp; Our beliefs about women and sexual attraction work similarly to that rope. They act as an invisible prison that keeps us from taking the risks that we believe are pointless to take. We learn that we are not attractive enough for the highest quality women by some societal standard so we stay in our lane and avoid asking those high-quality women out. For the most part, we dont even consider that it might be our limiting beliefs that are preventing us from dating those high-quality women. &amp;nbsp; Dont assume that Im right in saying that confidence is more powerful than looks or money (and that you can build confidence through approaching women), but dont assume that Im wrong either. &amp;nbsp; If you want to improve your dating life, you must adopt an attitude of optimistic skepticism. Doubt everything you read and everything you think you already know, and with an optimistic attitude, try new things: challenge your beliefs through real life experiences. &amp;nbsp; For example, if you think women just dont find you sexually attractive, you could challenge this belief by approaching many women and asking them on dates. Through risking rejection again and again, you will get an experience-based idea as to how attractive women consider you to be. &amp;nbsp; You will also learn what causes women to respond to you in different ways. Youll notice how your emotional state affects interactions, youll notice what you do that makes women uncomfortable and what makes women respond positively. As you learn more and more from experience, you will focus more on things that are under control. You will learn to focus on getting into a positive emotional state when interacting with women, on taking risks, on offering value, on creating sexual tension, etc. &amp;nbsp; The beliefs youve picked up through years of secondhand (cultural) learning will matter less and less because you will have more visceral, experience-based knowledge to work with. You will start to understand what women respond to on a gut level instead of on a purely intellectual level. Baron de Montesquieu said, A really intelligent man feels what other men only know. &amp;nbsp; **Is Pickup Weird?** &amp;nbsp; Approaching tons of women to improve your dating life is not a societally acceptable pattern of behavior, in fact, its a bit contemptable. &amp;nbsp; Theres a certain resistance we all have to cold approach because its not a normal thing to do. No one wants to develop a reputation as a creepy guy who spends his days trying to pick up chicks. &amp;nbsp; Its normal to feel some resistance to diving into cold approach because its weird. However, if you think about it logically, whats weird about it? Nothing. &amp;nbsp; Whats weirder, approaching women you find attractive or swiping right on pictures and messaging people you dont know in an attempt to bang them? Ten years ago, the ladder would have been weirder. Online dating used to have a strong taboo, but recently, its become so popular that its considered totally normal to swipe for sex. Cold approach will never be popular enough that it will lose its taboo, but that taboo is just as arbitrary as the one soceity used to have against online dating. &amp;nbsp; Importantly, you wont develop a bad reputation by approaching women regularly unless you are exceedingly aggressive. Ive approached thousands of women in a relatively small college town and did so with no social repercussions (to my surprise). &amp;nbsp; As it turns out, people dont care what you do unless its extremely peculiar, and even then, they dont care nearly as much as you might expect. &amp;nbsp; Any resistance you feel towards doing cold approach pickup is based on beliefs you have about what constitutes normal, acceptable behavior. &amp;nbsp; You wont be able to get the dating life you want unless you learn to determine your beliefs through your own experiences and let go of the societal baggage that has taught you misguided lessons about what women want and what you should and shouldnt do. &amp;nbsp; For more of my writing, check out: URL "
56,vulnerability,TheRedPill,A brief history of love,54,6oonln,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6oonln/a_brief_history_of_love/,2017-07-22 01:33:33,"A primary reason that modern relationships and gender dynamics are so fucked up is because pop culture constantly bombards people with an insane, bizarre, psychotic conception of love. Pop culture portrays love as pure emotion, and this conception has become the dominant view in the modern world, leading to almost apocalyptic levels of heartache and unhappiness. Instead of defining what the word love means, pop culture insists that love is undefinable, unexplainable, and magical, and furthermore, cannot be rationally understood or logically analyzed. This lack of definition allows love to constantly change form  sometimes it is strongly liking (I love ice cream!), having sex but not being too rough (making love), a zombie-like state you are in (Im in love!), or a selfish, meaningless declaration (But I love her!!), etc... The only thing modern views on love have in common is that they all portray love as a wild, passionate emotion, devoid of any obligation or practicality. Nevertheless, pop culture demands that love must conquer everything else, including societys rules, everybody elses advice, ones career, ones interests, and even rationality itself. According to pop culture, love is something you randomly fall into and fall out of with no forewarning or rational explanation. If you fall in love, you should drop everything and run to the person you love, no matter what the facts are. And when you fall out of love, well, you are free to leave, no matter what promises you made. The pop culture conception of love is so deeply ingrained in modern peoples consciousness that people think it is totally acceptable to make a ton of commitments and promises to a person, and then leave the moment theyve decided theyve fallen out of love. Pop culture love is why women feel no shame in going on the Jerry Springer show and proudly proclaiming that their affair with a married man is beautiful because they are in love. Pop culture love is also why people allow themselves to endure all kinds of abuse and terrible behavior from their significant other. In this article, I explain what I think love is, and I then briefly describe the historical processes that caused modern man to arrive at this twisted conception of love. **What is love? (Baby dont hurt me)** To start with, I believe that love, like everything else on this earth, can be rationally understood. The moment you accept that something is fundamentally irrational or magic you allow yourself to be controlled by your emotions or whatever nonsense powerful and charismatic people are selling. Love is beautiful and the fact that it can be rationally and maybe even scientifically understood does not detract from its beauty. True love is a contract between two people where the parties promise to do whatever is best for each other. You should only enter into this contract with people you like and feel attraction to, but once you are in, you must take the contract seriously. Different types of love exist: love between friends, love between a parent and child, love between a man and a woman in a sexual/romantic relationship, etc... Each different type of love imposes obligations on the parties, depending on the nature of the relationship, the individual themselves, and the circumstances of the relationship. Ideally, you determine what is best for your beloved by cold, rational calculation, and not your selfish desires. For example, you may want your child to go to college near you, but it may be better for your child to go to Harvard. Under my definition of love, you can love everybody commensurate with your relationship with them. Your love for your neighbor will be different than the love for your child, because your obligations to your neighbor are different than your obligations to your child. One day, ideally, all the world will come to love each other, but all we can do now is love people until they prove that they do not deserve our love. I believe that once two people commit to loving each other, an emotional bond forms that I call the real love emotion. The real love emotion is the feeling derived from the knowledge that there is another human being in this cold world that cares about you and will do whatever is best for you. The real love emotion is also the warm, happy feeling you get when you make that commitment to another person. We are wired to both receive love AND give it. When two people commit to doing the best for each other, they create an infinitely positive feedback loop. The real love emotion is the most primal, important, deepest, and strongest human emotion. It defines the difference between a fundamentally emotionally stable and happy person and one who is not. It should underlie all your other emotions like an operating system constantly running in the background and a person without it will feel empty and constantly need cheap pleasures: drugs, narcissism, distractions, etc... People who feel loved also like cheap thrills, but they do not have the same empty void to fill like a person who does not feel loved. Because the real love emotion is completely unrelated to the other persons looks, personality, status, possessions, family, or any other tangible thing, it can form between any two people, no matter how different they are, so long as they commit to loving each other. Real love does not require physical presence either  you can love somebody from afar as long as you are doing what is right for them. You can get the real love emotion from your friends, family, or even spiritual practices. The constant, primal human desire to feel the real love emotion is best satisfied when we are actually loved. If you feel like your partner will leave when circumstances or feelings change, that bond will feel weaker. We can lie to ourselves that we are loved, but ultimately reality will intervene and crush our soul if it is not true. This desire is why people sometimes form an unhealthy attachment to animals and also why troubled young women, sometimes as young as teenagers, have children just to feel loved. Some may argue that an alpha male does not have the same desire to feel the real love emotion that a beta male or woman would have because the alpha has no evolutionary need for anybody elses help to obtain food, shelter, sex, and protection, so therefore evolution did not create that desire in him. I dont know if this is true  I think it is very possible that the alpha male also evolved to need to feel love from the people in his tribe. But whether or not the alpha male needs love, no human man can feel like an alpha male at every moment. Every man has moments of weakness and vulnerability, and in those moments he needs to feel that there is somebody or something in this cold world that will help him. Of course, people can feel a connection to each other through other emotions. I call these emotions the peripheral attraction emotions. Examples of peripheral attraction emotions are physical attractiveness, sexually desirability, fun, personality, money, status, etc There is nothing wrong with peripheral attraction emotions, but I do not consider them part of love. In fact, peripheral attraction emotions and love are sometimes directly at odds  love requires you to do what is best for the other person, whereas peripheral attraction emotions are fundamentally selfish. My peripheral attraction emotions may want me to make a woman my fuck buddy but if I love her, I may encourage her to settle with a guy who will commit to her. Similarly, my peripheral attraction emotions may prevent me from confronting a drug addict friend because I dont want to ruin our fun, but real love would require me to do so. The peripheral attraction emotions are temporary, which is why conflating them with love has caused so much heartache in the modern world. My conception of love radically differs from pop culture love. Under my conception, there is no falling in and out of love. Love is purely a contract you enter into  after you sign on the dotted line you are in love and obligated forever. It is weighty and difficult. Mere pronouncements, promises, and feelings are not enough  love requires daily action. And you cannot love somebody until you have your own life together. Love is not a fun distraction from self-improvement  it is an integral part of it. A drug addicted loser who constantly needs handouts and help from others cannot love a woman because he is incapable of doing what is best for her. In some ways, my conception of love is unattainable because you can always become a better person and do a better job of doing what is best for the other person. But thats ok  I would rather love be an unattainable ideal we struggle to reach than a goal we feel like weve accomplished. My version of love does not require self-immolation. If the other person cannot or will not commit to doing what is best for you, you are free to break the contract and stop loving them. In fact, you MUST break the contract. If your beloved is a lazy drug addict, they cannot do what is best for you, so they cannot love you, so you should not love them. My version of love actually requires a form of selfishness, where you focus on optimizing yourself first before you try to help others, because you cannot help others if you are ruining yourself. You cannot give if you have nothing to give. If loving somebody is diminishing you as a person, you are progressively becoming more unable to do what is best for your beloved. Some philosophers define love as doing things for other people and asking for nothing in return, which sounds nice, but I think that type of love is unrealistic and unsustainable. Also, subsidizing and encouraging bad behavior by somebody is not doing what is best for them  it is creating a monster. I do not intend my conception of love to be too harsh or rigid. I understand that people have problems in their life and it is wrong to leave somebody in their time of trouble or weakness. This is especially true with children. Sometimes you must tolerate bad behavior from children because they do not know better. But to determine whether you should break a love contract, you should ask yourself certain questions. Is your beloved is acting badly because of genuine difficulties, or because they are just a shitty person who doesnt care about you? In other words, is your beloved going to get better if you help them or continue to be shitty? Is your love actually helping them or just enabling and encouraging their bad behavior? Are you doing all this stuff because it is rationally what is best for your beloved, or because you are in the grip of irrational emotions? Is your love for this person destroying you? Remember, their blood is no redder than yours, and their life is no more important than yours. A modern person might criticize my conception of love for ignoring emotion. I respond that the real love emotion is a very strong emotion, and the real love emotion coupled with the knowledge and feeling that the other party will keep their end of the contract will motivate you to keep the contract. Second, although the peripheral attraction emotions are not part of love, they are necessary for a healthy relationship, especially in the romantic context. You should not enter into the love contract with somebody you are not attracted to or do not like. **The interplay between peripheral attraction emotions and the real love emotion** Although peripheral attraction emotions are not technically part of love, they are incredibly important because human beings are apes and we have certain emotional and physical wants and needs. We need sex, we need food, we need shelter, and we need affection. If we do not get those things, it will be difficult for us to commit to loving somebody. A healthy conception of love would view peripheral attraction emotions as necessary preconditions that must be fulfilled so that the real love emotion can form. Peripheral attraction emotions are like a bridge connecting two people that allows ivy to grow from one person to another, the ivy being the real love emotion. If the bridge weakens or falls the ivy also usually goes with it, unless the ivy is very strong. The ivy wants to grow no matter what, so if there is no bridge to another person, the ivy will grow on some other structure, often in a twisted or bizarre way. However, the same way a cocaine addict cannot enjoy other parts of life if they are deprived of cocaine, people can become addicted to peripheral attraction emotions and ruin their ability to feel the real love emotion. For example, if a guy feels like he must have the hottest blonde at all times, he is naturally going to hop from woman to woman and never develop the real love emotion with any of them. Similarly, if a woman becomes addicted to rich men who buy her shit all the time, she will not be able to form the real love emotion because she will get bored of guys who stop spending money. Also, men will realize shes just a gold digger and kick her to the curb when they find a cheaper, hotter hooker. Interestingly, the media and entertainment industry encourages us to become addicted to peripheral attraction emotions by bombarding us with images of beautiful people, huge mansions, celebrities, fabulous lifestyles, crazy porn, etc.... Yet movies and TV shows simultaneously shame people who are attracted to money, appearance, or alpha males as shallow, while praising people who are attracted to stuff like personality (whatever that means) or shared interest in movies. Both messages are wrong: there is a room for attraction to appearance, financial stability, etc, but one must not become addicted to those things, lest you constantly chase a stronger high. The mixed messages sent by pop culture creates the worst of all worlds: people become addicted to peripheral attraction emotions, yet simultaneously feel ashamed of their addiction, so they date or marry a person whom they are attracted to for the right reasons, and then chase their addictions on the side. For many, a vicious cycle develops - because people are starved of the real love emotion, they chase ever more extreme versions of the peripheral attraction emotions, which cause them to have even more difficulty obtaining and keeping the real love emotion. Ultimately, true love requires controlling the peripheral attraction emotions. Your wife will not be hot forever. Your kid will not be likable all the time. But the goal is to force your rational responsibilities and your real love emotion to overcome your peripheral attraction emotions, which are lower emotions. **The science** The following is therefore a very rough sketch of the relevant science, with the caveat that I am not a scientist. Scientists have discovered many neurochemicals that are related to attraction and bonding between two humans, including serotonin (a neurotransmitter often associated with spiritual or mystical experiences  what your brain releases when you do psychedelic mushrooms), dopamine (a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure  what your brain releases when do cocaine, have sex, eat chocolate, etc), adrenaline (a hormone that gives you energy), oxytocin (a powerful hormone released by men and women during orgasm which scientists believe is associated with feelings of attachment), vasopressin (a hormone that works with your kidneys to control thirst and has also been linked to feelings of attachment), testosterone (the male sex hormone), and estrogen (the female sex hormone). Many of these chemicals are associated with human reward pathways that are designed to make us feel good when we do something beneficial for our survival and reproduction. Of course, other, undiscovered reward pathway chemicals may exist. These chemicals, as you may have been observed, are mostly related to the peripheral attraction emotions, at least partly because even scientists view of love is influenced by pop culture. Most scientists probably do not even know about the concept of the real love emotion and even if they have, it would be difficult to link the existence of the aforementioned neurochemicals to this particular conception of love using scientific methods. **A brief history of love** I present here a brief history of love. I make crazy overgeneralizations and oversimplifications (i.e., summarizing the entire Enlightenment in a sentence) to stay brief, so a real historian/philosopher would probably rip me a new butthole. When I say people in traditional societies thought like X I dont mean that every single person in those societies thought like X  I mean that X was the general prevailing thought pattern and was enforced by the powerful people in society. I note that traditional societies did not create social rules by analyzing science, but rather by aggregating the life experiences and feelings of many people, observing subtle nuances of human behavior, creating general rules with this information, and then incorporation and synchronizing these rules into the tradition. This complex process allowed traditional rules to capture complex and subtle truths that science often cannot. This complexity, however, made traditional knowledge vulnerable: most members of the society could not rationally articulate why these rules were correct, and the younger generation were expected to unquestioningly accept the tradition without adequate explanation. An inadequately articulated and defined tradition is vulnerable, which is how modern and post-modern thinkers easily destroyed tradition by simply articulating sensible-sounding counter-arguments. In my history, I do what I call back-conceptualizing  I describe social phenomena in bygone eras using concepts that the people in those eras may not have used or even been aware of. Historians do this all the time  the Enlightenment, Dark Ages, and Renaissance are just labels that modern people created after the fact to help understand those periods. Feminists back-conceptualize all the time. For example, they say that in traditional societies women were treated as property although nobody back then was consciously thinking my wife is my property. **Love in traditional societies** Most traditional societies viewed love similar to how I view love  as a contract whose terms depended on the nature of the relationship. In a parent-child relationship, for example, the child traditionally had an obligation to obey the parent, and the parent had an obligation to take care of the child. In male-female relationships, the contract was formalized by marriage (most traditional societies did not allow pre-marital sex or even dating), and each party was obliged to remain faithful to the other. Fidelity in traditional societies often had a far stricter definition than in the modern world; in some societies women were not allowed to even speak to another man without the permission of their husband. The man was usually obligated to work and provide for the family, whereas the woman was obligated to take care of the home and the children and to obey the husband. These contracts were enforced by society if a woman was unfaithful to her husband, not only could her husband divorce her or punish her, the entire society would stigmatize her, leaving her a social outcast, sometimes on the verge of death. Sometimes adulterous women were killed. These rules were supposed to apply to men, but were often enforced unequally. Biblical love is the epitome of love as a contract. In the Bible, God enters into a covenant with the Israelite people. The word covenant just means contract. Each party to the covenant was bound by certain obligations, including the duty to love the other. God promises to love the Israelites and the Israelites promise to love God. This is clearly not pop culture love. How can one be obligated to love God emotionally when one cannot see, feel, or talk to God? And when God loves humanity, he clearly does feel emotional the same way a modern person feels in love. God doesnt love people because they have a pretty smile or because they like Seinfeld. In the New Testament (a better translation of the ancient Greek title is actually New Covenant), the Old Testament covenant is replaced with a new, expanded covenant that includes all of humanity, but the love aspect is similar. Interestingly, God harshly punishes those he loves because he does what is best for them, not necessarily what they want him to do. Emotion was generally less important in traditional societies. Most people were expected to marry somebody that was considered good for them according to societys rules. The match was often made or approved by third parties, and in some arranged marriages the parties had no say it all in choosing their partner. Once married, people were expected to stay in the marriage no matter what, even if feelings or circumstances changed. It was unacceptable to leave because you had fallen out of love. Because emotion was less important in traditional societies, people were often prohibited from marrying people in rival castes, tribes, classes, etc... The idea of a soulmate that transcended cultural lines did not exist. Poets in traditional societies often churned out poems portraying a more modern conception of love, but the elders in those societies prevented people from putting that mindset into action. **Problems with traditional love** Although the traditional conception of love is similar to mine, love in traditional societies had serious problems. To ensure social stability, people were often matched for stupid reasons unrelated to the parties happiness or well-being like family alliances, social segregation, business reasons, etc... Traditional societies aimed for stability, so almost everybody was matched with somebody, even if they were unlikable and unattractive. The peripheral attraction emotions were largely ignored and many marriages were miserable, often from the very beginning. A defender of traditional marriage may argue that by obeying societys elders, married couples would eventually develop the right feelings for each other. This may be true to some extent, but the truth is that some people will never like each other, no matter how correct their relationship is on paper. The traditional love contract was also often unclear, oppressive to the weaker party, and unfairly enforced. What happens if one person becomes an abusive, lazy, drug-addicted, asshole? Have they violated the contract or must the other party stay? Traditional societies often did not have answers for these questions, and usually erred on the side of keeping marriages together, implicitly accepting that many people would be miserable. In traditional societies men often abused their position of power by imposing unfair and oppressive contractual terms on women. Women (and most men) have a primal desire to follow the leadership of an alpha male they respect, but most men are not alpha males (nor were they in traditional societies), so weak men often held onto their dominant position in the relationship by abuse, threats, and coercion. Furthermore, men that were not alpha males often mistook womens desire to follow an alpha male for weakness and stupidity, and treated women according to this low opinion. Women, however, are not stupid, and this oppression only increased their resentment and eventually made them amenable to feminism. Finally, because men were in power, they would often not enforce the contracts fairly, so, for example, a woman would be punished for adultery but a man would not. Love as a contract only works if the terms of the contract are fair, clearly understood, and enforced fairly, which was often not the case. Men, however, were not free of obligations, and it interesting that as social views on love and relationships evolved, many of womens obligations have been discarded (cooking, cleaning, raising the children), while mens obligations often still remain (supporting his wife and children financially). Perhaps this shift is influenced by feminism. A woman who does not cook or clean, and passes her child off to nannies is not considered a wrongdoer by either the law or most modern people, but a man who does not support his family is looked down upon and can even go to jail. Feminists sometimes even admit that the evolution of social responsibilities is revenge on men for historical misdeeds. Similarly, there is no enforcement mechanism for marriage vows, essentially making the institution of marriage an outdated relic of the past, like an old clock that decorates a room but no longer accurately tells the time. A few friends or family may shun a cheater because they see him or her as a bad person, but a cheater otherwise will generally maintain good standing in society and be able to date, find a job, etc... There are no legal consequences to cheating, and in fact, with the rise of no fault divorce, a person can cheat and still be legally awarded half of their spouses assets. Before you accuse me of being anti-man or anti-woman, I will note that unfair enforcement of relationship contracts is the result of a power imbalance. For example, in traditional societies, parents had disproportionate power in the parent-child relationship, so those contracts were often unfair and enforced arbitrarily. Children in traditional societies were often treated like slaves, and one of the innovations of Judaism and Christianity was to prohibit child sacrifice. **The evolution of love** Western civilization has a unique intellectual history, which led to a conception of love radically different from that of most traditional societies. I will briefly and simplistically summarize this evolution. In the Middle Ages, when Christianity had full ideological and political control in the West, a group of philosophers known as the scholastics began trying to justify Christianity with logic and rationality, often using ancient Greek philosophy to help their arguments. Most modern philosophers and respected intellectuals agree that the scholastic philosophers failed at proving religion rationally. No matter what you think of Christianity, you must admit that certain aspects of Christianity (god, heaven, angels, etc) cannot be rationally proven because there are no indisputable reasons to accept their truth (remember rationality just means with reason). Although some scholastic philosophy was brilliant, much of it was absurd speculation, and the purportedly rational arguments were anything but. The joke about arguing about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin began as a knock against scholastic philosophers. The scholastic philosophers created an important legacy, however: by re-introducing and emphasizing logic and rationality in European philosophy, and allowing non-Christian philosophers to join the conversation, the scholastics set the stage for the Enlightenment (around 1715 to 1789). Enlightenment philosophers criticized Christianity and tradition, much of which was based on Christianity, in favor of reason, turning the tools of the scholastics against them. Most Enlightenment philosophers were nominally Christian, probably because Christianity still held political control, but their work was subversive and often bucked Christianity and tradition. Much of the Enlightenment, like most Western Philosophy, was a failure from a purely philosophical standpoint. Most of the rational arguments philosophers have made throughout history were not actually rational but rather influenced by their feelings, political and religious allegiances, accepted thought patterns of the time, and other unstated and sometimes subconscious assumptions. The Enlightenment was no different. Philosophers of all eras have been pretentious, arrogant snobs, but the Enlightenment philosophers were especially arrogant, anbelieved that they could safely throw any tradition in the trash if they could disprove it with their rationality. This Enlightenment tendency still exists in the modern world, and helps explain the horrific conception of love modern people have. **The Romantic movement** The Enlightenment produced a lot of great shit like science, theories of democracy, etc But human beings are emotional animals, so any philosophy that tries to base everything on reason will lose popularity. Just as the Enlightenment was a backlash against the irrationality of Christianity, the Romantic movement (around 1780 to 1850) was a backlash against the over-rationality of the Enlightenment. Romanticism started as a way of feeling expressed in art and literature, and was only later articulated by philosophers. The Romantics emphasized emotion, imagination, spontaneity and individualism. And not just regular emotion, but deep, powerful, and crazy emotion. One could even say that Romanticism represented humans search for transcendence in an overly mechanized and rational world. Even though most people nowadays have no idea what the word Romanticism even means, the Romantic mindset has penetrated the modern consciousness so deeply that people dont even realize there are other ways to think. In the History of Western Philosophy Bertrand Russell argues that Romanticism is the root of many of modern societys worst tendenciesfake concern for the poor and oppressed, irrational rejection of tradition and morality, an unrealistic, idealized conception of reality, a rejection of practical things in favor of beautiful things, and worst of all, worship of wild emotions. Basically, the Romantic movement represents how far-left hipsters generally think. In art, the Romantics preferred crazy scenes of tall mountains, fearful precipices, sea storms, and according to Russell, what is useless, destructive, and violent to mundane, practical stuff like a lush meadow or fields of corn. In literature, Romantics rejected stories that could have happened to real people and instead focused on shit like ghosts, decayed castles, and pirates because they were only interested in shit that was grand, remote, and terrifying. **The modern conception of love** Modernity has combined the Enlightenments rejection of tradition and Romanticisms embrace of wild emotion to create a completely nihilistic, irrational, impulsive conception of love. Movies, television shows, pop songs, popular novels, and even high-minded intellectuals and university professors constantly hammer this view into our heads to the point where people will shame you if you do not accept that the love is nothing more than a wild, uncontrollable emotion. The dominant conception of love is also irrational, based on an idealized conception of the world, and dismissive of any practical considerations  a legacy from the Romantic movement. In love stories in movies and TV, two people that are not right for each other according to practical considerations nevertheless fall in love. After they are united, the movie ends. In other words, the movie ends before we can see the parties actually try to love each other. **The cycle of heartbreak** Because the modern world conflates love with peripheral attraction emotions, and relationships create no obligations, most people at least subconsciously know that the statement I love you is a temporary commitment at best and a lie at worst, subject to change when the persons feelings change or when they find somebody they like more. A collective action problem exists in the modern world  nobody enforces love contracts, so nobody fully commits to anybody else out of fear they will get screwed. This vicious cycle causes people to act more and more selfish and insular. The following story happens to many modern people, unless they live in a religious community that forbids dating: In middle or high school, which are unregulated zoos of young apes acting horribly and frequently inflicting massive and lasting psychological damage on each other, boys and girls form crushes on each other. The low status boys and girls are repeatedly rejected and often form intense feelings of inferiority and resentment against the opposite sex. Unless they fix their issues, these people often become forever alone types, raging woman haters, extreme feminists, and all manner of weirdos. This resentment can develop anytime in life, but it is particularly dangerous when it happens in children, because children do not have the cognitive tools to rationally deal with these thoughts and feelings. The high status or attractive boys and girls, on the other hand, get into relationships, often with no adult supervision or even adult knowledge. These relationships are often deep and passionate because teenagers have wild hormones and have never felt these emotions before. They also have not yet built defense mechanisms to getting hurt or rejected. This is why people often say your first love is the strongest. However, because middle schoolers and high schoolers are stupid and immature, and not bound by any obligations, one party almost always ends up cheating or breaking the others heart. The pain of being rejected by your first love is extremely traumatic, causing most people to consciously or subconsciously decide to not love again and to reject anybody who implicitly or explicitly offers love or a deep emotional connection. The real love emotion, however, is subconscious and can develop on its own, even if one does not seek a deep emotional connection. Peoples fear of love creates a bizarre paradox: we erect a love shield to repel love, but we lower the love shield when people do not claim to love us, and because our shield is down, we subconsciously form both peripheral attraction emotions and the real love emotion for the emotionally distant person. In other words, we are attracted to emotionally distant people because they promise to not create feelings of attachment, but we form feelings of attachment to them anyway. This is partly why so many men and women are obsessed with people who do not care about them at all. Relationships are a selfish exercise for most: we choose somebody we are attracted to but who makes clear they want nothing from us, we project our own feelings of love and attraction on them, and then we run away if they ask for anything in return. Furthermore, even though we try to repress the desire to feel love, the real love emotion cannot be destroyed and will express itself in bizarre and unhealthy ways. The real love emotion is often directed by the soulmate fantasy, which is the pop culture myth that every person is entitled to fall in love with their soulmate, who is perfect for them and thrills all of their emotions. Strangely, nobodys soulmate is ever a fat, lazy, drug addict  dont those people need soulmates too? The soulmate fantasy is a selfish lie. When we feel deep attraction to somebody, the soulmate fantasy, coupled with our desire to feel the real love emotion, convinces us that our newly found soulmate must feel the same way about us. Remember, movies never depict a situation where a persons soulmate doesnt like them! Despite its absurdity, the soulmate fantasy provides an ecstatic emotional high which causes us to develop insane, bizarre fantasies about our future with somebody we barely know. The pop culture myth of love at first sight, provides further justification for projecting our wildest fantasies onto a stranger, even if that person has not invested in us at all. When we feel like somebody is our soulmate, we begin to develop the real love emotion, even when there is no rational reason to. This is why people become stalkers. The person being stalked has not shown adequate interest, yet the stalker has created a fantasy in his or her own head that they belong together. As you can imagine, most stalkers are lonely and starved of the real love emotion. The idea of a soulmate is insane nonsense, so people are constantly disappointed, causing them to become depressed and lonely, which causes them to seek their soulmate with even more vigor. Many people are deep in this vicious cycle, causing them to instantly act needy and strange in any kind of relationship or interaction with people they are attracted to. Pop culture portrays love, relationships, sex, and dating as fun, lighthearted recreation, which causes people to not take these subjects seriously or think deeply or rationally about them. This lack of seriousness is extremely dangerous, because these subjects literally touch our deepest and most primal emotions, and can cause massive psychological damage and pain if they go wrong. **Love and game** Most pick-up artists and seduction gurus focus solely on peripheral attraction emotions and never mention love because, like most modern people, they have no idea what love is. They also assume that love is irrelevant to what they are doing. If I am correct, however, humans are always subconsciously seeking the real love emotion, even when they think they just want random sex. Seduction gurus mistakenly think attraction is the ""link"" that holds a relationship together but the truth is that the real love emotion is the link and attraction is the scaffolding that keeps the real love emotion in place. An alpha male who is pursuing his mission and is not a needy pushover is simply creating a clear portal for a woman to form an emotional link to him. A man who is needy, supplicating, or weak is clogging the portal with selfish emotions that repel women. Pop culture is not wrong when it says that women want a nice guy who loves them - pop culture just leaves out the fact that the man must also be an alpha male who is not needy or emotional towards them. In fact, women feel MORE loved around the alpha male who does not supplicate to her because he is being honest about who he is (a man whose focus is his mission), and is not trying to manipulate her with supplication. A weak beta male cannot do what is best for her because he cannot challenge her, protect her, be a role model for her, or expand her consciousness.

They became a couple. As the years went on, the guy noticed that the affection and sex was tapering off. He thought that ""being liked"" was important to her, so he tried showing her how much he liked her by being nice to her, and listening to her, and doing things for her, and so on. He was utterly confused by how this DID NOT WORK. &amp;nbsp; **Why don't women like to be liked?** I'm going to shoehorn this in here, because this is what I experienced in what I retrospectively labeled my bargaining phase. It was not covert contracts, it was *to love and to cherish,* and we all know how women treat vows. &amp;nbsp; ***TRP lesson:*** /u/LastRevision explains [why women don't like to be liked.](URL And as I point out in the comments there, **this effect does not diminish even in many-year-long relationships.** Also relevant is [the cardinal rule of relationships: more truths from the master.](URL &amp;nbsp; ***Depression:*** useless; dispensable. Skip this one if you can. I mean, I can see somebody recommending denial or bargaining, but no sane person would recommend for you to get depressed. In the context of your TRP journey, it probably is just **sadness** when you realize that sweet little girl you thought you had **didn't give one single shit about you when the chips were down.** And that will in turn likely develop into **low self-esteem.** The bottom line is **all this shit is unattractive,** and it becomes a horrible feedback loop: &amp;nbsp; There was a guy who thought he had a good woman. Then his grandpa died. The guy shed tears the way a normal human would. He turned to her for emotional support, and got none. In addition, the guy wondered why his woman wasn't interested in having sex with him. That made him even more sad, but things eventually went back to normal. Then the guy broke his jaw. After the drugs wore off and his face looked normal again, he wondered why his woman wasn't interested in having sex with him. That hurt, too, but eventually he healed up, things kind of went back to normal, but not quite. Then the guy got into a situation where he was working 16 hour days, felt like shit about it, but did it because obviously the money. He was tired and had no time to go to the gym, so he got out of shape. And he wondered why his woman wasn't interested in having sex with him. He got even more depressed when he saw the pattern and realized what kind of a shitty person she really was. &amp;nbsp; Seems like this is an extremely common reaction, as there are so many testimonials: ***TRP lessons:*** [Women do not give a shit about your problems!](URL [Need emotional support from your girlfriend?

I used to think it was a good thing to help guys **get past the anger.** /u/DentyneWhite helped me see how that was wrong: &gt; I believe anger is a useful stage and guys dont need to rush through it nor feel ashamed for feeling it. Focus on the **utility of anger.** Unlike the other stages, anger can actually get you somewhere. There is a distinction between **formless rage** and **catalytic anger.** Anger can get your ass in the gym or many other productive, improving modes the way NONE of the other stages can, no contest. In addition to the physical benefits of **anger as fuel,** anger also has practical psychological benefits: &amp;nbsp; There was a guy who went through the depression phase, was overworked, felt like shit, and got out of shape. When he turned to his woman for support, she wasn't there. He gave and gave, and got nothing. He said ""fuck this shit."" The guy shut the woman out of his life, did his own thing, fixed his work situation, and got into shape again. He laughed when the woman said she wanted things. He viewed her with disdain and derision. His indifference to her needs was sheer. She got incredibly turned on. The return of her sexual interest in him was unaccompanied by any kindness from him, because he saw that she was stupid, cruel, vain, selfish, lazy, and shallow. Her interest seemed to be renewed only because he was buff again. He wondered how many buff dudes she had fucked in the year that he was out of shape. He saw that she was merely an animal, and he didn't care anymore. &amp;nbsp; The disdain, derision, and indifference can be permanent. In my experience, many years have gone by, and the results have only been positive. ***TRP lessons?*** Everybody knows **hit the gym.** I haven't seen the *psychological* benefits of the anger phase much addressed, but I say: **Stay in the anger phase as long as you like. When you exit, maintain that perspective. Don't forget her true nature, and treat her accordingly.** &amp;nbsp; ***Acceptance:*** this sounds nice, but I don't really see it as useful, as it is more of a ""non-state."" It's just ""being."" Fine. But acceptance could perhaps turn into **complacency and backsliding,** which you don't want. Further, **acceptance certainly isn't necessary,** as plenty of swell guys like /u/MattyAnon and many others don't really seem to have a use for it. I had one conversation with him where he ranted about how you can't rely on women, don't expect loyalty, etc. and I said *But that's the way of the world! Why fight it?* and he said he was done fighting it, but he **sure as shit wasn't accepting it.** And then he left me with this great metaphor for a relationship with a woman: &gt; They have been dramatic (I walk), they've complained (I tell them to shut up), they've called my bluff on the relationship (I call it back). And yet nothing ever changes. **It's always my job to do everything for them, and it always feels like I'm dragging around a puppy on a leash. And that puppy is dead.** Not seeing acceptance or the need for it there. But such wisdom. God love ya, my friend. &amp;nbsp; **tl;dr: 1. AWALT, do not deny it. 2. You can't change reality by pleading. 3. Getting sad will make things worse. 4. Acceptance is overrated. 5. Not only is anger fine, it is useful, and has long-lasting, positive effects.**"
58,vulnerability,TheRedPill,How to Strategically Use Beta Qualities to Temper Your Attainability,20,6pftgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6pftgy/how_to_strategically_use_beta_qualities_to_temper/,2017-07-25 22:32:19,"Recently went on a date with a girl last week. Met off Tinder. It's actually a good market for high quality girls in EE (I'm American but moved to EE half a year ago). She's a dancer. Naturally beautiful (instinctually more conservative), also Eastern European (thus more conservative), so she naturally resists blatant fuckboy moves. We start the coffee date and she's immediately hooked. Loves my long hair. I hit her with sexual innuendos quickly. I ask about EE men and she says they're pussies. She's dated non-native this year and recently dumped one guy who started acting shady behind her back (he didn't know how to keep side bitches discrete). Fifteen minutes in, we take a walk and I grab her ass, kiss her, and pick her up in the middle of a park. She loves it. We talk about sex, and I tell her about my BDSM fetishes. She gets very horny. I try to pull but she hits me with the period excuse. I tell her I'm the captain of the Red Sea. She likes that but has dance practice soon. I consider pushing hard, but meet some resistance. We then agree to spend the weekend together. She tells me how she's going to bring lots of lingerie and is already calling me ""papi"" (I'm Latino and she loves that). I *should* have pushed harder to take her home that night but decide to play chill. Big mistake. The next day, I text her about logistics and she's still excited for the weekend, calling me papi some more. Then, the day of, Friday, I text her and she tells me, ""Hey, so I'm going to be honest, I met someone last night and he wants something serious. I think you're a lot of fun and crazy, but I'm looking for something serious, too, so I will have to cancel our plans."" This bums me out. She's pretty hot and given our sexual tension, the sex would be great. I delete her number and our WhatsApp conversation, thinking it best to move on. Then, the thought keeps hitting me, ""This isn't done yet."" I hesitate, because I don't want to get all bitchmade on this hoe, but I think about it some more and realize the problem isn't her respect for me or her horniness. It's attainability. She doesn't think there's any long-term value in me, and considering her conservativeness (relative to most women) and her good looks, she knows that she can get hot guys who will also commit to her or give her more, so she can drop hotter guys who she knows with pump and dump. I have a decision to make. Take the risk of looking like a bitch or let it go. Considering the highly likely chance of her cutting me off completely, I take the risk and call her (I checked our Tinder convo and found her number again). She doesn't know who's calling her, which means she deleted my number. If I didn't call her, we'd never talk again. I tell her that I'm not necessarily opposed to something *serious* but that I'm a bit cold emotionally with women sometimes and basically play the ""bad boy who tries not to care but does have a heart of gold"" frame. She melts. She tells me how sweet it is that I'm calling and that she wants to talk about this in person. She has a date with the other guy that night, but I suggest dinner the next night and she agrees. I accept the possibility that this guy might smash and win her over, but when I text her the next day about coming over, she's excited. He fucked up. I make some excuse about being low on funds and that she should come over for dinner and she gives me some bullshit, ""If you promise to behave :)"" text. I respond, ""I promise :)"" Obviously, I don't behave. Within the first few minutes, we're at it. She straddling me and tellin me how sxy I am. I speak Spanish to her, which she loves, and she tells me how unfair it is that I'm Latin (she has a fetish for Latin guys). She tells me that if I keep speaking Spanish, she's ""going to rape me."" I laugh. I keep hiking up her skirt but she pulls it down, telling me to behave. I know the LMR won't last long, though. She straddles me again, and I get a finger in her pussy. ""Oh...god,"" she moans. I fingerblast this bitch and she tells me, ""You're going to get your couch all bloody."" Still on her period. ""I'm the captain of the Red Sea, remember?"" I pick her up, carry her to my bed, and take this bitch to Pound Town. She spends the whole night with me and we fuck five times. We've spent a total of 2 hours together before sex. She tells me how much bigger I am than her ex and how she loves my ultra-masculinity, including my growling (I get pretty animalistic during sex). She tells me about the guy from the night before and tells me how he's already telling her that they should be in a relationship. She jokes, ""It happens to me all the time."" Most guys offer her a relationship in an attempt to cuff her. Bad move on their part. They went full retard/Beta. Thing is, *I* didn't promise her anything. All I did was hang the *possibility* of a relationship in front of her, without explicitly offering anything. I mean, I've already went on another date with another girl a few days after from my apartment building. Is she girlfriend material? Pretty close. She's hot, beautiful, doesn't drink/smoke, has a low partner count (relative to American girls and for her age, 25), and is very feminine and submissive (did whatever I asked her to do). For now, I'll keep fucking side bitches (and probably always; I'm a proponent of one-sided monogamy). So, in reality, I'm not Beta at all. But to get the pussy, I did show *some* beta qualities. However, because of the context, it was strategic. I would have lost her of I went full fuckboy/Alpha. She had deleted my number and I would never had heard from her again. So, what's more Alpha? Getting the pussy at no cost, really, or satisfying my ego by cutting her off? The answer is clear, considering how much she's texting me now and sending me tons of pictures and already making more future plans with me. Note: this is mostly for advanced guys who can act a little more romantic than usual to satisfy a girl's need/desire for romance without actually falling into the fantasy and diving face first into oneitis. Hope this helps some guys who are running into, ""You're too much of a player for me"" issues, i..e, attainability issues. Girls want good dick from a strong, sexy guy, but they also want *some* romance and emotional satisfaction. The trick, the mark of a good seducer, is balancing both without falling onto either extreme. Tl;dr - Girl wanted my cock, but knew I was a player, so I showed some vulnerability/emotion and outcompeted an actual Beta. Hector Castillo Edit: fixing typos and syntax. "
59,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Gendernomics: The NAxALT Error,17,6q2hcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6q2hcs/gendernomics_the_naxalt_error/,2017-07-28 18:21:22,"The challenge that is presented by AxALT and NAxALT, is that such statements are rarely statements of fact, but rather they are heuristics used in decision-making processes. Regardless of what internet debaters think, a great majority of decisions are made without consulting the latest academic research into the topic, and without engaging the mighty internet in a game of ""let me find sources that support what I have decided to do/believe"". People are generally much better at rationalizing a decision after it has been made than they are at arriving at a conclusion through research. This means that both ""AxALT"" and ""NAxALT"" become a Pascal's wager of sorts. For those who are not familiar with this argument, Blaise Pascal made the argument that if you were an unbeliever, you had every incentive to act and think as a believer, as one had everything to gain, and nothing to lose by doing so. The reasoning being that if you act and think as a believer you will be welcomed into Paradise upon your death, if you do not you will go straight to hell. Thus, the questions become: A) If I adopt AxALT as my position what is the upside and the downside? B) If I adopt ""NAxALT"" as my position, what is the upside and the downside? A is clearly the most efficient route, as it permits decisions to be made with little investigation and investment. Furthermore, it shields one from idealism and naivete, as one requires a person or group to demonstrate through their actions that they are in fact outliers from your initial observation, or that your perception of the mean is an erroneous one. The vulnerability of A is that one may err in judgment in those cases where one assumes that a situation will reflect the mean, which is correct from a probability perspective, and the situation is in fact an outlier. B, would be the more laborious option as it requires every decision to consist of data collection, data evaluation/analysis and then a decision to be made on a case by case basis. It also creates a situation in which your past observations cannot be adopted as a guideline for your present or future actions, as you must experience each case on its own. The major vulnerability of B however, is that the probability of error becomes much higher than in A. In A, one would have a 5 - 32% chance of being wrong, whereas in B one would have a 95% to 68% chance of being wrong. For instance, a man man who adopts position A, who considers getting married for the second or third time, will evaluate the proposition as informed by his past experiences with divorce, and the consequences thereof. Whereas a man in the same situation who adopts position B, would not adopt his past observations as a guideline for his present decision-making, as ""not all women are like my ex-wife"", and thus his previous experience is in no way relevant information for his future decisions. The unstated premise of ""NAxALT"" is simply that it is preferable to deal with the consequences of treating someone as a maximally positive outlier, as opposed to the consequences of treating them as being average. The Soul-mate myth is a prime example of this, in that if one treats all women as queens, nobody is offended, if one treats all women as common wenches, everyone is offended. **Read the rest here**:URL"
60,vulnerability,TheRedPill,How Running Changed My Life,183,6sb41c,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6sb41c/how_running_changed_my_life/,2017-08-08 14:15:03,"***Its hard to run almost every day and not have your shit together.*** #[Video](URL I'm going to explain some physical and cognitive benefits, but first of all let me explain how a simple jog most days improved so much of my life. I was always into lifting weights and I saw as cardio as something which just opposed this. I was wrong. **Running is meditative,** it's peaceful and once you break through the uncomfortable pain of starting, the pain begins to become a pleasure which is rewarding on so many levels. Modern humans and our immediate ancestor Homo Erectus have several adaptations which make us incredible long-distance runners. With long, springy tendons in our legs and feet, like large elastics, we store and release energy with each running stride. The endurance running hypothesis tells us that humans would chase an animal for 5-10 miles until it died from heat stroke. However, take this with a grain of salt if youre going to make the claim that we evolved to run long distances. Fossil records make it very clear for much of our history we would sprint, climb and crawl to scavenge. 5-10 miles per day runs an irrational risk of depleting glycogen levels and without a kill falling victim to predation through the vulnerability of fatigue A study done at the University of British Columbia found that **regular aerobic exercise increases the size of the hippocampus.** The hippocampus is an area of the brain responsible for **verbal memory and learning.** If I run in the morning I feel sharper, I experience clarity and Im much more focused. Additionally, researchers found resistance, anaerobic training did not have the same cognitive result. Lifting weights are great, you build muscle, it takes discipline and theres the obvious aesthetic appeal, however, too many of us seem to categorise types of exercises as being mutually exclusive and so we miss out on certain benefits. **The ancient Greeks when training for war would exercise the entire body  this is a principle that many later ancient Greek athletes swore by.** For the best results for your well-being, ***combine yoga, weights, callisthenics, Qi Gong, running, basketball and dont become compliant with only one form of exercise.*** Sure, focus on one, but dont see cardiovascular and strength training and being exclusive and incompatible, the truth is they are synergistic. **Burn calories, not time.** Listen to a podcast while you run, or no music at all and listen to your breathing. Turn running into a chance not only to exercise for the sake of exercising but to meditate alone. Empirical evidence suggests the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal cortex have greater volumes in people who exercise. Running on a regular basis will allow new blood vessels in the brain to develop and even increase the rate of success for the survival of the birth of brain cells. Cardiovascular exercise will also reduce insulin resistance, inflammation and stimulate various growth factors. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor or BDNF is a protein is a protein encoded by the BDNF gene. This protein regulates neuroplasticity and the survival of cells in the brain. BDNF also increases when you periodically fast as well as in those who take anti-depressants. **Running is our natural medicine.** If youre making a decision about what exercise to do in order to lose weight, forget about it  this essentially comes down to your diet. **Focus on nutrition for your body composition; exercise for discipline.** Some great ways to ensure you make the most of the running is to apply some principles from the ancient world. The Stoic meditation of negative visualisation is useful. Before each run or exercise, envision the worst case scenario; injury, tripping and falling, do this in order to never be disappointed and to relieve yourself from placing satisfaction on surpassing some arbitrary number. Set a goal for your run, but never attach your satisfaction on this goal, instead be satisfied with the fact that your attempt is what is worthy. **TL;DR:** *Incorporate some running into your daily routine. You wont lose gains, you'll just become clearer, have more intent and live longer.*"

62,vulnerability,TheRedPill,How To Develop God Tier Eye Contact | The real reason why you can't maintain strong eye contact with a woman.,650,6ssb17,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6ssb17/how_to_develop_god_tier_eye_contact_the_real/,2017-08-10 19:56:17,"##**The Eye Contact Problem**## I was on YouTube the other day when I stumbled across a video titled Video For Practicing Eye Contact. Surprisingly these types of video generate millions of views These videos usually have a beautiful girl looking at the camera, your challenge being to maintain eye contact? Wtf [**TLDR: Video Post**](URL Enough bullshit, its time for people to really understand the truth about eye contact. Failure to hold eye contact is a deep-seated issue; its not a technical one. The reason people cant maintain eye contact isnt due to the fact that they dont know how its because of the beliefs they hold that lead them to feel uncomfortable. Social Conditioning: Dont show attraction! Men have been emasculated by society. Many men feel ashamed of their own masculinity. They somehow feel that showing interest in a woman is wrong or taboo. They will go to great lengths to avoid eye contact with women. I partly blame these new age Feminazis for fucking up the biological male and female sexual chemistry (nothing against proper feminists). ##**The Deeper Issue**## More often than not, a failure to hold eye contact with a woman derives from an issue within. They say that the eyes are the gates to the soul, so when someone looks deep into our eyes a part of us feel vulnerable. This vulnerability is amplified if there are some unresolved issues within **yourself**! If you have a hint of self-loathing or low self-esteem, it will manifest itself in bad eye contact. If you are not living your life in accordance with higher ideals, if you are not aligned with your personal values and ethics, it will manifest itself in bad eye contact. Most potent of all, if you are ashamed of yourself, it will manifest itself in bad eye contact. Geeks that masturbate to their favourite anime character in their mum's basements at 3 AM will almost certainly never have good eye contact with a woman. People that engage in fraudulent activities (unless sociopaths) never have good eye contact. The issue isnt technical, as you can see its deeper than that. Confident Eye contact Having you shit together entails:  Having a clear mission in life  Having set values  Having personal ethics  Embracing your masculine energy  Having set boundaries A confident man with his shit together will never have an issue with eye contact. He will be comfortable with himself and feel at ease during a conversation. Why would you feel scared or vulnerable when youre at peace with yourself? How could a woman threaten you with her sexual essence? It cant happen for the confident man. ##**Steps to Building Eye-Contact**## Here are some real practical steps to help you build your eye contact. **1.** Dont watch fucking practice eye contact videos on YouTube **2.** Find out what deeper issue is causing the eye contact problem and promise yourself to resolve it. **3.** Start practising eye contact on **REAL** people, if you are nervous look at the spot between their eyebrows. You should, however, move onto their eyes. **4.** Dont stare; use appropriate breaks during the conversation (usually every 5-10 seconds but depends on the person you are talking to). **5.** Focus on one eye, you cant focus on both at the same time (try it). **6.** When talking to a group, spread your eye contact evenly amongst each person. Dont block anyone out and focus too intensely on one person. **7.** Dont open your eyes too wide like a fish, you can blink this isnt a staring competition. **8.** If you are feeling awkward, thats good. You are getting out of your comfort zone; soon this shit will be a breeze. **9.** Prosper ##**Game changer**## Once you improve your eye contact you will notice more women being attracted to you. Eye-contact is one of the best non-verbal cues for confidence. When you can talk to a girl while looking her dead in the eyes you stand out. You stand out because most emasculated men are ashamed to do it. They cant do it. Now I want you to go out there and experiment with this. If it helped you, come back to this thread and share your success story. "
63,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Advanced Game: Tactics and Technology used by Females,121,6i35wk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6i35wk/advanced_game_tactics_and_technology_used_by/,2017-06-19 10:41:12,"Im going to start this post by issuing a *WARNING*. If you are in the ANGER phase of your Red Pill transition and experiencing Red Pill Rage, some of these points will trigger you. Keep calm and press on. If you are in the Denial phase i.e.: ""NAWALT"". All women are like that but all women are not capable of doing things to the degree some women can because they lack the resources, capabilities, liberties, sexual appeal, intelligence etc. The hypergamous instinct is there but the capacity in which to enact it is RESTRICTED. It is not a choice but enforced upon them to behave a certain way if they can not maximize their sexual agency and the same goes for men as well. The factors that inhibit or promote a females hypergamy determine their tactics of manipulation. The same way a Man manipulates the environment to create tools and opportunities via strength and ingenuity, Women manipulate emotions and perceptions via beauty and sexual primacy. There's crossover in tactics between both sexes, but females are natures Machiavellian. If you are in the Bargaining phase i.e: ""MY SMV is ___"" or ""If your SMV is high enough she won't ___"" or ""If your Alpha ___"" thats apex fallacy and Homer wrote 2 epics about that over 2000 years ago. They are called The Iliad and The Odyssey. This mentality will set you up to be used as a tool or discarded as a tool. The point of this post is to hip Men to some aspects of The Game. The Game that is still going whether you take your ball and go home or stay and play. Better players make for better games and I've seen far to many men get obliterated in the past few years to stay quiet. Im not a fan of either sex being used maliciously and unknowingly but I personally cant deal with any more despondent and suicidal males. The following info is derived from reconnaissance compiled by ""the fly on the wall"" and a ""trench fighter"" in the field. These observations were made at the ground level and are not hypothetical in context. They aren't case by case occurences but patterns of behavior observed on a constant basis over large demographics of women. Data from real-time text, social media and email communications from females to males and females to females was used to pinpoint strategies employed by female when involved with males. The age ranges span from young 19 year olds to early 40 year olds . The females were of all races, multiple locations and varied socio-economic status. This is the stuff that goes on right under your nose and you most likely never even suspect it. The phrase "" Hoe is life"" is a humorous moniker in some circles but holds real weight when you consider the gynocentric nature of Humans and female nature itself. Im going to keep this lengthy report as straightforward and digestible as I can. Hopefully this will sharpen the lens of many and with increased awareness, help us formulate better strategies in order to keep from being preyed upon. Let's get to it. 1.Hoe relocation ""When, where, why?"" Why is she wherever she is? Females separated from their herd are red flags. geo-proximity to family and purpose for being where she is are questions men should ask. ""New job in a new place"" or ""College"" is a common answer but not the only answer. Females who are running from their past will relocate to new areas or get into new social circles to escape their Hoe reputations. Women will also compartmentalize their social circles. They will have hoe friends that they do hoe things with and have a totally different group of friends that they use to keep up appearances with. Friends vs Associates in theory. Fellas vette her circles often and thoroughly if you are going to interact with her for any length of time. Women WILL use men to monkey branch into different social circles. Isolate her and see what her behavior defaults to. 2.Virgins and Born again virgins She celibate/abstinent? Why? Discover the answers. Contrary to what a lot of men want to believe and what some surveys will say, females have sex earlier than most males. Far earlier. Unfortunately some females have their flower buds plucked very early due to physical force from people that most societies would deem ""predators"". In that same breath many girls are willingly sexually active in their early teens simply out of biological drive. There is a high school freshman gleefully getting her hymen crushed under the bleachers during 4th period or in a public park bathroom as we speak. There are tribes in S.America and Africa and Asia where numerical age isn't even a concept. Just child bearing and non-child bearing stages of physical maturity. Drop the ideology there are a bunch of 18+ yo female virgins running around, especially in Western or liberal cultures. Hard patriarchal Arabic cultures dont have large quantities of 18+ yo virgins so what do you think occurs in more liberal cultures without checks, balances and surveillance on the virginity they deify? The Female Imperative is slick and will exploit Blue pill conditioning with the concept of pseudo-virginity that has pervaded culture. Many women will employ this tactic in attempt to re-brand themselves. At some point in life the ""Born again virgins"" females sexuality has caused her grief and hardship. Now she is trying to hit the reset button and get other people to buy in so that her perceived value goes up and her ego is consolidated. The caveat to this is that they will still remain sexually active. New virginity/celibacy is a ruse they will employ to deceive the masses and specific people while discreetly engaging in sex with someone. Notch counts are important for a plethora reasons and we all know this but remember sexdrive is an instinct. It doesn't factor in STD's, poor decisions or trauma. It simply knows desire and fulfillment. Its up to our higher level functions to try and make sense of everything else intertwined with sex. Unless the desires are constantly restricted on an individual action-by-action basis, social conditioning only offers a modicum of security. The higher functioning ""maturation"" process many allude to is reactive vs proactive. Females WILL hamster up a causation to RIDE the Cock carousels after losing their virginity if they can. Females will also attempt to save face if they have the inability to compete in the SMP or if they are forced to forego the carousel due to enforced restrictions. I.e. ""matured past that"" or ""Oppressive patriarchal chauvinistic culture"". Remember this ""T-Rex dont want to be fed. T-Rex want to hunt.""... until they can no longer hunt, then being fed will have to do."" 3.Cellphone secret apps, Secrete online communities. If you are not abreast on technology let me fill you in. There are a multitude widely available phone apps that allow you to hide things within your phone while making everything seedy like a normal phone interface. Their are split phone apps that look like normal apps but when opened via specific instructions, allow users to access hidden information. You can have txt, voicemails and calls forwarded here. You can store completely different(useable) phone numbers here and hide photos as well as videos. Many women use these types of apps to separate their different relationships. Some women secretly have 2-3 phones and use ""Work phone"" as an excuse as well. Watch her. Google a girls phone number just to make sure there's no escort ads associated with it. SERIOUSLY. Unless you willingly hired an escort. Another contrary to popular belief is the assumption that most affairs and booty calls happen late at night. Most ongoing affairs happen between 10 AM and 3 PM when people are in relationship with someone who cohabitates with them or is within a 35 mile radius. Long distance relationships shouldnt have the ideation of fidelity even attached to it. Unless the female your with is isolated and or under constant in-house surveillance by your FEMALE relative. It is highly probable you will be cuckolded if she is still viable in the SMP. ""When the cats away, the mice will play"" If a girl constantly instigates a argument with you via telephone or in person, its textbook ""Gas lighting"" and shes merely rationalizing finding attention elsewhere. Their is no ""Frame"" to hold afghan this ought a shit test for dominance. There's no PUA taught, linguistic neuropathy induced kill switch thats going to keep your bitch from getting fucked. No deeper conversation to be held. Its simply somebody elses turn to have her for a moment and thats her cover fire. Secret social groups are not new. They are prevalent online and there are many Social media groups online in which both men and women share views that are not always expressed in more public forums. These groups merely feed the need for risqu indignation that women crave. Theirs not a high level of interaction outside of it but liaisons do occur from time to time. Hence ""Girls on Vacation"" or ""Business trips"". These things are common knowledge to be times when people hook up. Secret groups just facilitate the sequence of events that lead to impromptu ""vacations"" or should I say ""sexcations"" and ""business trips"" 4. Perfect Girls and the Dopes they rope. The most insidious forms of manipulation Ive seen come from women that are sweet, quiet and submissive. A woman that is trying to stay beneath the radar is just as hypergamous as the less discreet ones she just uses different tactics. These girls seem like the perfect girls because they don't ring alarms. They disarm you with the illusion of submission and vulnerability. They are cat burglars. They are usually foreign women. They typically have families back home you need to take care of or they are isolated anti-social women in general. Foreign ""born again virgins"" feast at The Buffet of Simps once they decide to hop off the local CC by employing ""submissive"" game. A lot of them solicit funds after arriving to the their new destinations with their new man, simply to send back home. Many times ""back home"" is previous lovers as well as family members. Trophy wives and gold diggers use this same strategy to extract resources and funnel them back down the socio-economic ladder too. Yes the isolated submissive may play their role, understand you are playing yours as well be careful how much you provide and elevate her. Be wary of women that need only dick or attention because 4/10 times there is going to be a pissed of provider male or other form of jilted lover waiting at your door with a bone to pick. Dont loose your mind, life or freedom over pussy fellas. Personally, the 3 longest running affairs Ive ever Been involved in were with a rural and traditional Japanese housewife who was brought back to the states. A married Latin girl who was a fitness instructor and a White woman from Texas. All sweet as pie domestic homemaker types, freaky as pornstars and slicker than a can of oil. The Japanese and Mexican girls are still married but the White girl started to have too many affairs and got sloppy. Husband beat the shit out of her when he found out. She served him papers and relocated halfway across the country to marry another pro athlete. I hope this post helps somebody. Dont loose yourself in the hype. People have free will and anything short of literal oppression isn't going to stop that. Focus on the purpose females serve and not the terms of reciprocity because you will get let down. Make your mission your purpose is generic advise but its true. Dont be a simp ass Beta or a sucker ass Alpha. Be a man with moxy and cunning. TL;DR: Females have tactics tools they use too execute their sexual strategies and maximize their sexual agency. Here are some skills and constructs they use. Dont hate them or trust them. Utilize them and check them. Dont hate yourself, alot of men dont know how or why women do the things they do, but don't remain nave either because some of this stuff will have you wanting to eat a bullet or worse. "
64,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Surrender,27,6ihxph,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6ihxph/surrender/,2017-06-21 09:34:46,"Essay: URL Excerpt: Most of my readers are aware of my stand on the myth of male vulnerability. Weakness is not strength, but the Village of the Feminine Imperative, would have us believe that the more a man displays honest signs of vulnerability the more endearing hell be to women. The Blue Pill conditions men to believe that crying, or being more emotionally sensitive, or really anything that makes him identify with the feminine in his personal character is a form of this endearing vulnerability that women can (by appealing to equalist reason) be expected to respect in a man. While adopting this mindset may open a man up to ridicule (and unspoken disgust on the part of women), this is not true vulnerability. The Village might try to convince a man hes being brave by avoiding conventional masculinity, but this emasculating vulnerability is nothing compared to what a man has to lose from real vulnerability. What I think most men, certainly all Blue Pill men, miss is that the ultimate form of vulnerability a man can engage in is catching feelings for, or emotionally investing himself in, any particular woman. And this is especially so if that mans Blue Pill conditioning makes him oblivious to the risks of that vulnerability. Nothing leaves a man more vulnerable in life, love, family, career, finances and really power over the direction of his life than to invest himself in a woman. The very act, the very thought, of surrendering his lifes imperative to the trust that a woman wont exercise the unimaginable control and potential for damage she has in his life is a vulnerability no woman will ever recognize or acknowledge; nor will the sacrifices that come from this vulnerability ever be something she has a capacity to appreciate. Even in the best case scenarios, where a mans investment is reciprocated, or a somewhat idyllic relationship grows between a man and a woman, such is the state of our modern sexual marketplace that a potential for a mans ruin still colors that relationship. Our feminine-primary social order has, through legislation and social pretense, made the proposition of any man navigating the sexual marketplace one of inherent vulnerability. Women rarely understand the vulnerability a man is opening himself up to because our social order makes that potential for his harm invisible to her. In fact, if he resists opening himself up to potential ruin hes considered to be insecure, and this in turn is attributed to his maleness. I have no doubt there will be women reading this last paragraph and think, Well, women are putting themselves at risk too, we have to be vulnerable too. No, you really dont. Since the beginning of the Sexual Revolution every potential aspect of vulnerability for women in the SMP has been meticulously compensated for, or insured against the worst. Whether thats the grossly female-weighted divorce and custody laws, or legal abortion, or arbitrary consent laws that only serve women, or the special dispensation for women academically or vocationally, any and all vulnerability risk is mitigated for you. The emotional vulnerability you believe is so costly pales in comparison to the risk and consequences that vulnerability represents to men. Men commonly have more to risk, more to lose and invest more of themselves into that risk proposition. True vulnerability, the kind that opens you up to life-destroying consequences, is when a mans idealism for women, despite knowing all the very likely, very destructive, consequences is something he willfully ignores. For a Blue Pill man, his vulnerability is rarely ever recognized. Thanks to his life-long preconditioning he believes in a romanticism that insulates him from ever acknowledging the risks and the all-downside potential of that vulnerability. This obliviousness  keeping a Beta-in Waiting blind  is a primary goal of Blue Pill conditioning."
65,vulnerability,TheRedPill,"Rejection, and why you need to seek it",125,6m0hw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6m0hw1/rejection_and_why_you_need_to_seek_it/,2017-07-08 21:28:49,"Mainstream pickup advice will try to tell you that there are ways to attract all women, all of the time, if you just say the right thing or perform this one magic trick. Hell yes, even if you're fat slob living in your parents' basement, if you just repeat these two phrases, you'll instantly bed lingerie models. Like there are lingerie models hanging around on every street corner. This is a validation-seeking paradigm that will ultimately hurt you, because you're attached to an outcome that you have little-to-no control over. You'll psychologically whip yourself to death, because you'll constantly feel like it was your fault when a girl rejects you, and ruminate over every little 'mistake' you make. ""Oh man, why did I say that! Why did her hold her hand at that point!"" Not counting your mother, family, or children, no woman alive is worth that much suffering. I don't care how special you may think she is, there's always someone just as special. Whenever you feel anxiety over a girl liking you, what you're actually feeling is fear of the truth being reflected back at you, that you're an unattractive soft guy. Let's pause for a moment and think a bit more analytically about male attractiveness. In his book *Models*, Mark Manson proposes a new way to measure it: * Your attractiveness as a man is determined by how non-needy you are * Your non-neediness is expressed by you acting with vulnerability * You act vulnerable by being completely honest with yourself and others Now if we take that last part, showing your honest true self with women, by that act alone, your attractiveness as a man will increase. As an aside, you must also take away the fact that you will feel a lot more relaxed in your social interactions, because you are no longer performing. Most attraction-based dating advice is actually performance-based, which is far more stressful and is at its core dishonest. Now if you express your truth with women, expressing opinions that she may disagree with, blurting out things that you normally would have thought but never said, and telling her when you disagree with something she says, and tell her unconditionally that you think she's pretty and you want to date her, you're in a much more maintainable position. If she becomes receptive to your expression, then great! Escalate physically and go from there. You'll enjoy a much happier relationship with her because you're actually expressing your truth, and not copying what some YouTube loser told you to say or perform. If she rejects you, you have also succeeded. Why? Because if you've shown your true self to her, and she still doesn't want to continue the interaction, she's shown you a key thing. Why would you want to dedicate time and effort to a person who doesn't appreciate you? If the interaction developed from there, it wouldn't have worked out well anyway. Have some self-esteem and strong boundaries. There must be no discernible difference between your thoughts and your spoken words. I find that a lot of guys act more relaxed and, without knowing it, attractive around the 50-year old secretary at their office, than at the clubs and bars, where they mumble their words and fumble around buying girls drinks. Do you know why? Because you don't give a fuck about the interaction and are just having fun. If this fundamentally feels wrong to you or makes you feel uncomfortable, then you need to ask yourself some hard questions. Do you feel like you are 'enough' as you are? Do you feel like you have 'attachments' as Dr Robert Glover calls them? By that, I mean do you think if you weren't fit, if you weren't smart, if you didn't have a degree, you would still be worthy of attraction? Otherwise, I suspect you subconsciously feel like you aren't worth the attraction of girls, and therefore you feel the need to perform, because if you were truthful and expressed your honest self, you would be rejected. Mark Manson calls this strategy of embracing rejection ""polarisation."" By being truthful about your thoughts, you are forcing her to make a decision about you. To save the two of you time, you must polarise her as quickly as possible. Don't hesitate, blurt. Make non-sequiturs, they're much better than an awkward question to break the ice. Sound stupid? Then laugh at yourself. Have fun. Live in the moment. If you think you're inviting a mountain of rejection onto you, you'll actually be surprised, because most women will at the very least appreciate your boldness, and more often than not she'll be attracted to that. Rather than focusing on an outcome that you have no real control over, instead see the interaction itself as the goal. Approach the situation with the mentality of ""I hope she's right for me, and will be worth me going over to talk to."" Forget lingering outcome-dependent thoughts like 'we need to kiss at some point', instead maximise your fun and her's in the present moment. That's what she's going to be attracted to more, that's what's going to make her feel a net gain in fun and happiness by being around you. That's what's going to get her out on a date with you. To truly destroy lingering outcome-dependent thoughts like the one above, think about how they serve you? They don't. I'll repeat this again, whenever you feel thoughts like that, forget them and instead return to expressing your truth and maximising your fun and happiness in that present moment. And if she still rejects you, you've still succeeded. You've achieved more success than the mainstream pickup advice can ever promise you. By embracing rejection, by seeing rejection as your friend and not something to be afraid of, you'll feel much more relaxed in your interactions with women, and ultimately save yourself and her a lot of time and unnecessary effort. --- **TL;DR: Rejection is your friend. Don't avoid it or fear it, seek it. Be truthful. Polarise. You'll be happier with the results, and you'll both be saved a lot of time.**"
66,vulnerability,TheRedPill,I was bullied by girls when I was young,17,6ma4rm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6ma4rm/i_was_bullied_by_girls_when_i_was_young/,2017-07-10 07:34:31,"**Summary:** Story of how an 8th grader bullied a 3rd grader Some days ago, I was reading Models by Mark Manson. I was thinking of mostly vulnerabilities. I came up with many, but I couldn't remember anything strong enough, but then suddenly it hit me, one of my horrible past which I had forgot. I am sure, this is not what he means by vulnerability too, but here it goes to show how shitty women are. I was in 3rd grade, enjoying my innocence. I was friends with every girl and guy in class, I used to mind my own business and fun. (I sometimes think if mgtow means live like a child). Then an 8th grade girl comes into my life, we had to travel back and forth in the school bus. She was a typical feminist type, arguing and shit. I dont remember beinng attracted to her(I was small:P) but if I remember correctly, she used to have nice tits and used to flaunt navels. I dont even remember why, but she would start fights with me, getting the other girls of my age to revolt against me. It had got so bad, that I had to go home with injury marks from forks she used to poke me with, while some of the girls held me tight. Everyday home and back to school was a nightmare when these girls could do anything from harassing me to physically injuring me, no one used to care saying we were kids and having fun. She used to shove rubbish into my mouth, She used to laugh, tying me to poles, or throwing me around. She used to slap me square in the face whenever she saw me. I was literally her play doll. She used to grab my dick and squeeze it till it hurt, sometimes kick me in the nuts for resisting. Sometimes, she used to forcefully put my hand into her clothes and massage wherever she wanted and slap me for being disobedient. She used to rub her butt with her hands and make me smell it. She used to rub my hands on her pussy and make me lick it. (No wonder I have cunnilingus fetishes now) One day, it was enough, it was too much, she comes at lunch break to steal my favourite sweet, and I get up and beat the crap out of her back. I don't even remember beating her, but I remember the feeling. She takes a week leave coz she got hurt/fever or some bullshit. Her parents complain the principal complaining that I was abusive and used karate on her (My self respect was my self defence, I knew no karate). Complaining my mother was an uneducated hag under my father to have given birth to such a son. Blackmailing how they would go to court and pull me down. Putting out all sorts of feminist agenda. (I now remember that her dad was completely pussy whipped) From that day, I used to just stare her down like a prey and would bitch slap her if she touched me, sure I got scoldings by my old hag lady principle, but no detention maybe because she was a unicorn or liked me for my genius or knew what had happened or it gave her tingles thinking of it. From that day, I was the leader of guys and other girls used to stalk me. I never cared coz I knew how manipulative they are. I was wayy skinny back then. I got fat enough to look intimidating to girls after. But I fall for it again and again once I forget this. This may be one reason I am never ever attracted to feminine girls as other guys say they do, but I fall hard for the dominating slut. Maybe this is why I can hold frame forever with a feminine girl, because I feel nothing. Ever wondered why boys hate girls before hitting puberty? Pushing girls away just so they can have a good time with their buddies? We see them for what they are. Its the puberty that deludes us. Wondered how you used to oogle at breasts when you were small and used to catch your mom or any other female in their bullshit? Yeah, feminism ruined us **Lessons Learnt** Girls have no emotions, when they say they have matured enough, it means they are much more harmful. If you used to hate girls when you were small, remember why. Never fall for the outer cover. Control your hormones."
67,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Like doesn't attract like - why your masculinity is key,85,6mggcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6mggcm/like_doesnt_attract_like_why_your_masculinity_is/,2017-07-11 04:41:50,"As men swallow the Pill and learn that girls actually get the gina tingles for strong dominant masculine figures, this often conflicts with years of indoctrination that he needs to do 'the right thing' and follow women's own advice to be nice and Just Be Yourself. This advice that women give, while on the surface well-intentioned, is actually borne of the feminine imperative to maximise their own powers of selectivity over that of males. The advice encourages men to expose their 'true' alpha credentials, or lack thereof, so that the women can identify through behaviour which men to sexually pursue. Don't conflate the Just Be Yourself trick with the idea of vulnerability. Vulnerability is the willingness to risk a woman's rejection through polarising women's opinions of you through brutal honesty. It's a display of genuine non-neediness, inherently an attractive trait, which shows a lower level of investment in the interaction with the woman than her's. However, Just Be Yourself encourages guys to unload all of their stories, baggage, and whining on the first date, killing any mystery and attraction that the woman may have felt. Also, guys are often so exposed to stories told to them by their female friends about all the 'jerks' they've been with, that they assume that they're the unique one - that they're the one nice guy hero in a sea of jerks. It's actually the other way around. The nice guy is one of *millions* in a sea of nice guys, and the few guys with genuine sexual options are the 'jerks'. They're usually not absolute 'jerks', but they do lean at the minimum a slight few more degrees than average to that side on the nice-jerk spectrum. Therefore, it's worth noting that in present times, even a slight inclination of a few degrees towards the jerk end of the nice-jerk spectrum will be enough to induce a woman's interest. I keep wrapping 'jerk' in inverted commas because what it actually represents is the concept of a man with an alpha mindset, whether learned or ingrained since puberty, whose masculine traits are optimised. He's confident in himself, he's aloof, he doesn't placate to others, he doesn't need a woman's validation, or indeed any validation. He's confident in his life mission, and he passes shit tests through having multiple genuine sexual options. Girls flap their wings like angry hens at these stories of being treated poorly because they're constantly in a state of emotional flurry about these guys, in turn because of their attraction to these guys. But these nice guys take their girl friends' stories at face value, when they should realise that these girls are subversively **screaming** how much attention they're paying to these so-called 'jerks', and therefore are totally wet for. Don't listen to a girl's words, listen to her behaviour. If she's spending time agonising about her roller coaster of emotions over a guy, that should *scream* to you her level of interest in him. All the while, they tell nice guys how they wish their jerk boyfriends were nice like them. And it's from this validation that quite reasonably, though disastrously, the nice guys deduce that they must double down on their nice qualities to gain women's affections. They become more like women, and interact with women like other women do. This is a grave mistake, as it completely destroys any amount of masculine-feminine polarity in the interaction between the nice guy and the women he meets and tries to attract. He tries to attract them with nice conversation, buying her drinks, and trying to negotiate her favours. This creates no tension at all, and makes her feel nothing for him. This leads to a string of inevitable friend-zone rejections. As David Deida wrote in *The Way of the Superior Man*, there must be a masculine-feminine polarity for an inter-gender relationship to be enriching for both the man and the woman. Unlike attracts unlike. The more feminine the woman, the more masculine the man must be. This is why the nice guy's strategy and graduation of his nice womanly qualities cause him all the more rejections and friend-zoning. He has mostly female friends, he talks to women endlessly and gives them all of his attention. He gladly rearranges his entire schedule around women, and gives up all of his free time for them. His attention from a woman's perspective is therefore worthless. And attention is the coin of the realm for women when it comes to dating and sex. The nice guy must break out of this cycle to gain his desired success with women, and it must come via a concerted effort to increase his masculinity. * He must immediately abandon all his female 'friends' and cease paying any attention to them. He can return to being their acquaintances after the transformation is in full swing, but initially he must make this step * He must hit the gym and start a lifting regime focussed on increasing his strength and muscle size. Even better if he can find a sport he enjoys too, which compliments the next item on our list * He must prioritise spending quality time with his male friends on a regular basis. If he has none, he must make an effort to make some, or reconnect with old school friends * He must spend a period of time in self-reflection on his insecurities and emotional health. Dr Robert Glover's *No More Mr Nice Guy* is the gold standard on male emotional health Note that these all follow the common pattern of **strong self-investment**. When ready, he must approach dating with a different mindset - one of genuine non-neediness. The only way he can achieve that is by having multiple sexual prospects at any one time. You pass girls' shit tests by rejecting their power plays and showing you're not afraid of confrontation - you are more than happy to break up with one of your prospects because you intrinsically know you have value to other women too. This spreading out of your attention will also naturally increase your value to these women without deliberate effort. Yes, cocky and funny, diverting, and all the other tactics work when passing shit tests, but at their core is the strong impenetrable level of non-neediness that we must all strive for. Only with experience approaching women can you see this for yourself, and only with that experience of rejection can you see how little effect it actually has on you. And that's the way you will be able to completely call a woman's bluff and be completely okay with breaking up with her - it doesn't have to be overt, but she'll be able to sense it through your behaviour and demeanour, which you'll gain from your self-investment and non-neediness. --- **TL;DR: Like doesn't attract like, so don't act like a woman in your attempts to attract women. A man's masculinity is directly linked to his level of self-investment. Focus on your masculinity by lifting weights, prioritising time with your male friends, and pursuing your life goals.**"
68,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Burn the Encyclopdia Betannica,99,6nlj7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6nlj7a/burn_the_encyclopædia_betannica/,2017-07-16 20:17:04,"Too many beta chumps fall into the trap of blurting out every fact about themselves on first dates with girls. This feels tempting to the beta who's been told to Just Be Yourself by his female family and friends his whole life. It destroys any sexual tension that was once there. All the mystery has gone. Girls don't want to hear you recite the Encyclopdia Betannica. It destroys all mystery and imagination. A girl's imagination is your most powerful friend, because it feeds their competition anxiety, which we often call *Dread*. Nothing wets the female's loins like the mystery of the non-needy man who ignores her texts for days at a time, only to return with panty-wetting excitement and fun in spades. The mere act of approaching her with boldness and clear (yet not overt) sexual intent will be enough to let her imagination run wild. By not giving her all of your attention, and by not overtly explaining your sexual situation at any one time, she will imagine the competition she has all by herself. If a girl's imagination is your most powerful friend, then in turn her feelings of competition anxiety are your most powerful tool, and best of all, it's a passive process. By not divulging everything about your life story, combined with genuine non-needy behaviour, it'll happen by itself. Take your time when describing your life. She needs to earn it. You should have a good enough lifestyle that any woman should feel *lucky* to be a part of it. If you don't, go Monk Mode for a few months until you do. Casually drop in that you went on a date yesterday. If she asks how it went, just say 'yeah it was alright' and leave it there. She now realises that you're a man other women want to go on dates with, and hence fuck. See the power in that small disclosure? Remember, when you approach her, you have already beaten 99% of the terrified beta chumps out there. She starts off with the assumption that you're an alpha. She's rooting for you, hoping you're the cool guy rather than the awkward one who fumbles over himself buying her a drink with nervous laughter. Each self-deprecating story, each bit of nervous laughter, each factoid you give her about your past sexual history, chips away at your perceived alpha cred. That last item is of prime importance. You can never benefit from telling her your sexual history. When I started out in earnest approaching girls, I had been with one girl my whole life. Every single new girl assumed I had had a bigger body of experience with girls than I actually had. This assumption is partly from their feminine solipsism, but it's mostly assumed because of your boldness and attractiveness. Quoting a recent comment of mine: &gt; The problem is that most dudes have the Monogamy-as-goal mindset, borne out of a desperate scarcity of female intimacy. Think we can all empathise with that. &gt; &gt; For example when a girl finally replies to them on POF, they clutch onto her for dear life, acting nice so as to not offend her sensibilities, while at the same time she has 10 others. If they actually meet up, he'll splurge every fact about himself, destroying all the mystery. Women want to have 'figured you out' with their feminine intuition, not heard the Encyclopaedia Betannica. If the relationship does progress, it's in her frame, because she's the one who cares the least, and in turn has the most power. &gt; &gt; 'Spinning plates' or just having multiple female prospects, not giving all your attention to any one of them, puts the situation firmly in your frame, because your non-neediness will show through your choice of options. Also, your behaviour will indicate this choice of options, stoking her competition anxiety, which is your most powerful friend of all in dating women. Once again do not conflate this with the concept of vulnerability. That's the principle of risking rejection through brutal honesty and qualifying statements, not crying about your spirit crystal. Be vague, don't vomit every fact about yourself, and whatever you do, never fully tell her your sexual history. Nothing is more satisfying to a woman than the thought that she's ""figured you out"" with her feminine intuition. Burn the Encyclopdia Betannica. --- **TL;DR: Beware the trap of blurting out every fact about yourself. Your life is a precious commodity that women would be lucky to be a part of. Stoke her imagination and competition anxiety, they'll passively do more for you than any funny line will.**"

I was hesitant to post on this sub because I don't totally buy RP theory, and the subreddit network TRP falls in is mildly concerning. Still, I've found some threads here really instructive, and I was encouraged to post by a fellow subscriber so I want to contribute my knowledge. I hope you take what I say here with the same grain of salt as I have taken in my months of lurking this sub. In my personal philosophy, skepticism and a corresponding willingness to change ones opinion in the face of new evidence is the mark of a true alpha. *Note: Im going to try to define terms as I use them, but youre all big boys here so you can do your own fucking googling.* **What is sexual dimorphism?** Most people are fed the false notion that female neurobiology is no different than that of their counterparts, but Im pretty sure anyone who says they believe this is either lying or actively deceiving themselves to maintain face in their social circles. It is not misogyny to admit this. Feminism *is* believing women deserve equal rights and equal pay for providing goods or services of equivalent quality as men. Feminism *is not* believing that men and women are not different. If you look at the natural world, *sexual dimorphisms* are ubiquitous. Why do male [gorilla skulls](URL have massive sagittal crests while female gorillas have a smooth cranial surface? Presumably its because sagittal crests provide a point of attachment for mastication muscles, and female gorillas-- who, like all higher animals, are constantly performing [subconscious reproductive fitness assessments](URL saw this as a trait likely to correlate with survival and reproduction. The weird thing about sexual dimorphisms is that they form whats called a [positive feedback loop](URL e.g. [duck penises](URL So they dont always make sense when you think about it in terms of X trait is linked to more babies, less death by predators etc. etc. This is a pitfall I see RPers fall into all the time as they reference what women evolved to be like on the African savannah to make their case for how AWALT. So we need to be tuned into the things that women are assessing us for, particularly those things which are not evolutionarily obvious. **What do female brains suck at compared to male brains?** * Mathematical reasoning, spatial reasoning, mental rotation of objects, mental estimation of physical force required to accurately throw objects long distances, motor processing tasks. How does this help us attract a mate? Answer: disregarding the fact that professional athletes are at the top of the sexual hierarchy in our society, these differences provide us with almost no utility or insight on how to attract a mate. **What do female brains do better than male brains?** * [Female neural networks have an edge over males for their connectivity](URL and therefore efficiency. Likely an evolutionary artifact of a time when female brains needed to work overtime on social reasoning tasks to navigate tribal hierarchies and ensure their survival and hereditary transmission. * Females are better at information recall, and cognitive performance. Most critically, they have significantly better inhibitory control. What does that mean? Answer: It means they have a more functional **prefrontal cortex** -- the part of the brain in charge of inhibition. Want to know what else the prefrontal cortex does? [it helps with having a coherent personality, coordinating thoughts and actions, goal formation, planning complex behaviors, understanding the subtleties of social interaction](URL All this makes it seem like they should have dominated men by now with manipulation, higher thinking, etc... While that does happen (and Im sure weve all read enough stories on this sub about it) it hasnt happened as much as it should have, given their ability to outperform us in these areas. Why? Well, I can give you my hypothesis. * It probably has something to do with their neuroendocrinology, increased limbic activity, higher synaptic concentrations of 5-HT/corresponding upregulation of 5-HT transport, higher levels of oxytocin and dopamine as well as oxytocin/dopamine receptor overlap in certain neural regions.* **tl;dr**: *theyre emotional as fuck*. There are many reasons for this, one of the primary ones probably is that estrogen and testosterone remodel the brain in different ways, causing different hormones and hormone receptors to upregulate or downregulate. Another sexual dimorphism. **Exploiting Female Neuroendocrinology** Have you ever heard of **voles**? Theyre mammals-- rodents. Theyre a lot like us. There are several species, but there are two closely related species of interest. One of these species, the mountain vole, is sexually promiscuous-- fucks everything vole-like which moves. Then youve got your old prairie voles. They mate for life. Im talking hard-core pair bonding monogamy. [A dude name Smeltzer got it into his head to figure out why](URL and he had a Smeltzing good time of it, Id say. They found that the monogamous voles had an overlap of particular receptors for oxytocin (hormone for attachment) and dopamine (hormone for pleasure) in their median prefrontal cortex. Basically, this means that the part of the voles brain that triggers social attachment colocalizes with the same part of the brain that triggers a pleasure response. The result is that the voles fall in **love**. **A side note about love** Yes, it *is* love -- Its important all you beta fucks realize that what you call love is a completely neurochemical phenomenon which is not unlike substance addiction. Literally, it is your brain confusing shit. Ever been heartsick after going through a bad breakup? Youre having withdrawals from an addiction. Its not a coincidence that [oxytocin is linked to addiction vulnerability](URL But is a rainbow less beautiful because you know it is light refracting through water droplets? *No.* Is music less beautiful because you have a complex comprehension of electrical waveforms? *No.* Love is the same way. It is human to love, and love is a source of beauty and joy. My main criticism of TRP theory is that it *sometimes* rejects features of the human experience as a strategy to avoid pain. **Back to Exploitation of Females** So look, female humans have a lot more oxytocin riding around in their system, and if the model from voles extends (spoiler alert: [it does](URL then females arent using their prefrontal cortexes to modulate complex behavior and navigate social structures to achieve species wide dominance. No-- oxytocin and dopamine are making all that sophisticated networking and inhibitory goodness exert its power over one task: finding a mate. *Here is where all the puzzle pieces fall into place* In order to make yourself indispensable to a woman you must associate yourself with this oxytocin/dopamine axis. Shes got a social-attachment dedicated neural framework built for formulating complex, goal-oriented, thought-to-action activity, dude. If you arent keyed in on how to make sure that framework is formulating how to make you her mate, then you arent likely to succeed. So how do you do this? Go [Pavlovian](URL Start at the source, and create a pattern recognition motif in her brain. You have to repeatedly stimulate the part of her brain that controls the release of oxytocin in a way she will learn to associate with you. That part of the brain is the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus responds to many things. We can only realistically exploit three of them The first one is *smell* * If you do wear cologne, wear the same cologne and the same amount of that cologne every time you are going to be near her. Consistency of scent is important. This is not as trivial as it seems. Many men overlook olfactory stimulation, even though it represents another avenue towards solidifying the association youre attempting to create between yourself and her dopaminergic pathways. Smell is also the most tightly linked sense to memory, and oxytocin is known to strengthen memory. This can create another positive feedback loop. Except instead of creating corkscrew waterfowl penises, this one gets you laid. The second is *stress*. * Make sure that every time you are around her, you are destabilizing her in some way while maintaining a positive, attractive, consistent energy and appearance. This is why women love men who make them try things they have never tried before, and take them on adventures, etc. Do not let them get comfortable in the beginning. Comfort = boredom, boredom does not stimulate oxytocin. The third is *genital stimulation* * Note: please do this consensually. Rape and sexual harassment (aside from being heinous crimes) are not effective, moral strategies for effecting attachment in females.* * This is the biggest one. If some girl tells you that sex isnt important to her, and that shes way more interested in having a man who can attend to her emotional complexity, shes straight up lying to you. Also probably having sex with someone else. * Be consistent and thorough when you engage sexually with a partner in whom you would like to create attachment. If you do this right, eventually her brain will not be able to discern between pleasure stimulated by sex and pleasure stimulated by your presence in her life. * Female orgasm, while highly associated with oxytocin release, is not required. General genital stimulation can induce significant levels of oxytocin. Orgasm comes easier to some women than others. I was shocked to learn from one of my female friends that men commonly say things like I want you to cum on my dick, and Are you close? when having sex with her. Please, wtf, no. Dont be that guy. * This is a way for you to maintain your alpha frame. You arent stimulating her because you want to please your queen, youre stimulating her because youre hacking her neurochemistry. Maintain control. Otherwise please be directed to one of the many cuckoldry subreddits. I appreciate the opportunity to be heard on this subreddit, I wish you all the best of luck in your endeavors. Feel free to point out which parts of this demonstrate my ignorance, etc. etc "
70,vulnerability,TheRedPill,"What Sexual Intent Really Is, Why It's So Powerful, and How To Use It Effectively",56,6d7k08,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6d7k08/what_sexual_intent_really_is_why_its_so_powerful/,2017-05-25 14:57:59,"**Decoding what women really want can seem like trying to solve a Rubiks cube in which each square is a different color.** &amp;nbsp; In many ways, what turns a woman on is fundamentally different from what turns a man on. Research has found that one of (if not the biggest) turn on for women is their desire to be desired. &amp;nbsp; Evolutionary psychologists believe women desire to be desired because intense desire from a man signals his faithfulness. Evolutionary psychologist David Buss explains this through an unlikely source, romance novels, Readers identify with the heroine as a powerful and compelling object of male sexual desire. The heroine has sexual control because the heros overwhelming passion for her ensures his sexual fidelity to her. In essence, the hero becomes dependent on the sexually powerful heroine. &amp;nbsp; Women have an unconscious desire for a man who is so sexually attracted to her that he loses control of himself. This signals to her that when she mates with him, he wont abandon ship and leave her to take care of a helpless child alone. This explains why rape fantasies are so common among women. Its not because rape is intrinsically sexy, its because for a man to rape a woman, he must be so desirous of her that he would risk everything, his entire life, just to have her. &amp;nbsp; What triggers a womans desire to be desire is what is sometimes called sexual intent. Ive seen time and time again, that strong intent, by itself, is a huge turn on for a woman. She can feel it in her bones when you have a genuine, confident desire for her, and it makes her feel the same towards you. &amp;nbsp; Its the most powerful trigger for sexual attraction there is, and when you feel a strong sexual intent, you will be shocked at the ways women respond to you. Theyll start saying things like, We shouldnt be left alone in a room together or, I havent felt butterflies like that in years. Intent is what sweeps a woman off her feet. &amp;nbsp; Intent can seem like a woo-woo concept, but its well grounded in experience. To understand what intent means, consciously think of a sexy naked chick. You will (hopefully) feel turned on when you do this. Thats using intent. Intent is simply your desire to project a certain feeling, whether it be a tingling sensation to your hand, or a feeling of sexual desire to a woman. No, youre not sending her magical seductive laser beams, youre simply projecting your desire for her, and she can feel it. Just like you can feel when someones angry at you, you can feel when someone desires you sexually. Intent isnt a Jedi mind trick, its an extension of your state of mind. If youre feeling anxious and unentitled, women will feel that off of you, and no matter how much you affirm to yourself, I am projecting a strong sexual intent, its not going to work unless you feel that way internally. &amp;nbsp; Intent is a consequence of the actions you take. If you spend your night out approaching women and putting on a pickup shtick or being an entertainer, youre walling yourself out from projecting any genuine emotion to the people you interact with. &amp;nbsp; Intent requires a lot of vulnerability. To start projecting your intent, what you need to do is to start making yourself more vulnerable. I do this by making a very direct statement of intent even when Im uncomfortable doing so. If Im talking to a girl, and Im feeling defensive and nervous, I will say something like, Sorry Im being kidna weird, honestly Im just feeling nervous because youre intimidatingly attractive. &amp;nbsp; As soon as I say this, I feel the weight that was previously making me defensive and anxious lift off my shoulders. By making myself vulnerable I free myself to feel genuine intent. Oftentimes, the interaction with the girl who I am vulnerable with turns around, too. Sometimes it doesnt, but either way, my night is always better for it because I get over my fear of letting women know Im attracted to them, and in so doing I let myself feel attracted to them emotionally. &amp;nbsp; Tl;dr- intent is simply your emotional desire for a specific outcome (with a woman). We dont show intent because were afraid of getting rejected if we make ourselves vulnerable. To change this, make vulnerable statements of intent, tell a girl she is so attractive that shes making you feel nervous.

A Plausible explanation is that being submissive can cause a woman to feel sexually desirable, and her sexual desirability, in turn, gives her power and control over her partner. Overall, we found that two reasons women gave for having sex I wanted to submit to my partner and I wanted to gain control of the person were related; statistically, they clustered together, suggesting that sexual submission can in fact be a means of gaining control.

And an underutilized one. When was the last time you sat there and tried to figure out what Joe Blow or Jill Blow was thinking? Spend 20 minutes. Focus your intent. See how quickly you can come up with three things that indicate their long term goals, values, and internal state."" Nietzsche saith, ""Pity is for bitches. Compassion is the last remnant of values that have consumed themselves."" Okay, I paraphrased. I'm good looking- ish. High IQ. Very high emotional intelligence. Well read. Always been pretty athletic. Yet, I was a fail beta incel cuckmaster Lord of Shiteating. At least it was with a quality girl - as far as the sociopathic cluster B vagina-mechas (that is, a giant robot that serves as a vehicle for vagina) that we call 'girls' go, she only cheated on me, what? Six thousand times? Why is this? Because I didn't know any better? Fuck no. I have a gut, and unlike most people, I have long been trusting it. I was also pretty smart. And emotionally smart. So why did I continue down the failpath from the ages of 17-27? Why? Because I FELT BAD. I was captain saveaho from day one. Had I not given a fuck, said girl would have been a blip on my lifedar of awesome achievement, and/or drug addicted debauchery and lameness. Either way, I would have moved on at the first warning signs, and slayed some new pussy, secure in the knowledge that if I had one hot chick, I could have another. But I clung. I'm not the clingy type. So what swayed me? BECAUSE I FELT BAD. I wanted to take care of her and fix her abusive childhood blah blah fucking blah. This is kinda my thing. I help people get over their issues. But in that line of work, the worst thing you can ever do is feel bad for a client. You can't hold anyone accountable if you pity them. In fact, we've created a pity culture, exactly inverse to the rate which we've ceased to tell people to man the fuck up. ""We are heading towards a new European Buddhism."" Nietzsche. Where nothing is true, reality doesn't matter, you resign all pleasures, achievements, procreation, and generally make yourself as small as possible, in order to nurture the virtue of feeling bad for others. Now Feng Hsui, my guy, you're named after a famous Zen monk. You vegan this - or began it, rather - by talking about Machiavellian powergod Robbie Greene and EMPATHY. Contradict much? No. Empathy is a skill. A skill that anyone who wants to get better at life needs to possess. Helping people, even saving people, are admirable goals. Teaching a man to fish. But you never, ever want to fish for the man. And you never, ever, ever, ever ever want to teach a man who doesn't want to fish. He won't thank you for it. Very simply, chase framing. The pussy must come to you. You never go to the pussy. Likewise, ""The student must come to the master. It is not seemly for the teacher to travel to the student."" Confucius said that. Cool story. Once, a Lacanian therapist (If you have tolerance for highly obscure and difficult and postmodernist type shit, I highly recommend reading Lacan; begin with Zizek's essays on him on Lacan.org) in Montreal was chilling, doing therapisty stuff. A man who he knew to be psychotic walked in, set down a bottle of liquor, and pulled out a revolver. ""Now one of two things is gonna happen here,"" he said. ""Either I'm going to shoot you, or we're going to share a glass of this cognac like men."" ""Shoot me if you need to,"" said the therapist. ""But I must say, given a choice, I prefer the cognac."" I love that story. That moment was a moment of truth. What he could not show was fear or weakness. What he could also not show was pity. You see, the man was upset and craved recognition. He respected the therapist as a man, as a figure of authority, similar to Dad or God - If you follow Freud and Lacan. What he craved was masculine recognition, from a man worth granting it. To pity him is either to show yourself too weak to grant that, or too distant, too far above him, to acknowledge him. Misunderstanding that situation, the therapist might have paid with his life. He understood because his frame was so deeply internalized, his toolset for understanding humans was so intuitive, and because his job was to practice empathy. But pity would have been, perhaps, a death sentence. So stop it, right now. Stop feeling bad for people. Even basic bitches are humans with autonomy and intelligence, even if they sell it away. They deserve respect, in the form of setting aside your ego and learning to empathize and understand. Empathy is the root of social power. Pity is vulnerability and possible death. If you're comfortable suffering to get better, you'll be comfortable with other people suffering, as well, and you can even help them direct it towards being better themselves. But that doesn't make you a hero. It doesn't make you anything but what you are, a selfish asshole. Be selfish. Learn to empathize. It's a skill. Beware of cutting slack. Beware of treating people like they can't help themselves. They can. Do they want to? What do they want? Empathize and find out. And I'm out. * edited for typos "
72,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Why You Should Actively Seek Out Social Tension/Discomfort,178,6f5aeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6f5aeu/why_you_should_actively_seek_out_social/,2017-06-04 13:18:11,"**We live among a generation of men who are so afraid of social confrontation that they avoid assertiveness like its a plague.** &amp;nbsp; Weve learned to value pleasantness over honesty and vulnerability. We keep it to ourselves when we disagree with someone, we keep it to ourselves when we want to say something controversial, and we keep it to ourselves when we have a crush because we are afraid of the social consequences of vulnerability. &amp;nbsp; We dont admit to ourselves that we do this, because to do so would be to accept a narrative that your ego is extremely fragile and easily damaged, which is a narrative that your ego is far too fragile to accept. &amp;nbsp; When attempting to become more aware of your own limiting beliefs, analyzing your thoughts is an important tool. It does have limitations, though. Your thoughts are not nearly as trustworthy as youd like to believe. &amp;nbsp; Your conscious thoughts explain your emotions in a way that reinforces your self-concept. If you have a negative belief about yourself, your thoughts will be warped by that belief. Its important to question your thoughts, but the most effective tool for doing so is often through reading your emotions. For example, if you believed that rejection wasnt a big deal, the following would be easy for you: Go to your college campus, a mall, or a bar and make new friends. Introduce yourself to at least three people. &amp;nbsp; For most people, this challenge isnt just hard, it triggers paralyzing anxiety. Hell, I tried this when I was eighteen. I still hadnt even kissed a girl so I gave myself a mission to approach women in hopes that I could get a date. &amp;nbsp; I went with a friend, we gave each other four hours to get some girls numbers at our university campus. We were both nervous, but we figured with four hours wed be able to make something happen. &amp;nbsp; As we walked around the campus, we saw girls we wanted to approach, but we always had an excuse: Shes too tall. Shes in a hurry. Shes looking at her laptop. She looks like a lesbian. Etc. &amp;nbsp; Most of these excuses were bullshit, but they were compelling to us because they provided an opportunity to avoid our paralyzing fear of social tension and rejection. &amp;nbsp; After we spent two hours meandering around the campus, we had a realization: this wasnt going to work, we needed to change our approach. We decided to make our task easier by using a crutch. We absconded to a nearby corner store and bought two Four Lokos (which if you dont know, are 24 oz beer-like drinks with 12% alcohol content). This was enough to get us both drunk. We slammed down the drinks and felt reinvigorated due to the social lubrication. &amp;nbsp; We returned to campus midday, drunk, and we repeated the same pattern (only this time we felt like idiots because we were drunk in the middle of the day). After two more hours of meandering around campus we walked home severely disappointed in ourselves. &amp;nbsp; We both avoided trying to meet women again for months. This should be an embarrassing anecdote that highlights an unusual social phobia that was shared by my friend and me. But its not, because our social anxiety was in no way unusual. Its the norm. Ive seen it time and time again, most guys become paralyzed with fear at the thought of saying hello to a stranger. &amp;nbsp; Logically, this behavior is absurd, theres nothing to be afraid of from approaching a girl. The worst-case scenario is that she isnt interested in talking to you and brushes you off. So what? Our egos are a lot more fragile than we like to think (our ego has a strong desire to think that it isnt fragile). We give the simple act of meeting strangers tremendous meaning, thinking that if were rejected well be humiliated or our reputation will be ruined. &amp;nbsp; The more desperately you avoid rejection, the more emotionally painful the thought of rejection will become. A man with deep inner confidence doesnt care about or avoid rejection; he has experienced it enough in the real world that it no longer means anything to him. Hes okay with risking a socially tense moment by being assertive because hes been assertive enough times that he cant possibly buy into the delusion that boldness can lead to painful consequences. A man of confidence is able to accept the fact that a stranger might be uninterested in meeting him, that his boss might not give him that raise, or that his crush might not like him back. Because hes okay with the idea of rejection, it doesnt mean anything. Therefore, what for most people would be emotionally paralyzing is a non-event for him. He doesnt have an emotional need to be pleasing. &amp;nbsp; We dont protect ourselves from real social consequences; we protect ourselves from imagined social consequences. We do this so effectively that many people NEVER put themselves in a vulnerable position. The truth though, is that by protecting ourselves from rejection so desperately, we constantly reject ourselves. &amp;nbsp; If youre afraid a girl wont like you, you make her lose interest in you by playing it safe with her. If youre worried people wont like you enough, you make yourself less likeable by trying too hard to make people like you. Modern men put so much effort into keeping a pleasing mask on that they forget theres something better beneath that mask. In college, I had a friend who gave zero fucks. What would have been extremely embarrassing for most people, was just a fun anecdote for him. Once, he walked up to his TA and asked her on a date in front of hundreds of students. He got brutally rejected, but the next day he told us the story while laughing about it. &amp;nbsp; I also had a TA I was attracted to. Unlike my friend, I wanted to ask her out in a pleasing way. I planned my big move throughout the semester. I considered asking her out during office hours, but I thought that would be too awkward for her. I told myself Id wait until the last day of class and then ask her out when it ended. &amp;nbsp; After class, I sat in the hall and told myself I would wait for her to leave and then Id ask her on a date (I didnt want to embarrass her in front of her students, after all). Of course, I hesitated and never ended up taking the risk. If I had asked her out, she probably would have rejected me, but so what? I cared so much about whether or not I got rejected, that I rejected myself. I rationalized excuses that were profoundly stupid for an entire semester of college. If I had just stepped up, I would have had an anecdote about getting rejected that I could have laughed about later. &amp;nbsp; Or, I might have gotten her number and ended up dating her. Now theres no way to know. &amp;nbsp; Since then, I made a rule for myself that has led to crazy (and sometimes embarrassing) stories. Whenever I get a gut feeling for a moment that I should approach a particular stranger, or ask someone out, or do anything that causes me to feel emotional resistance, I ask myself, What would make the better memory? &amp;nbsp; I dont always take action because of the question, but when I do, I never regret it. The answer to that question is almost always the best course of action to take. For More, check out: URL Facebook page: URL "
73,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Embrace Your Flaws,26,6f8s75,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6f8s75/embrace_your_flaws/,2017-06-05 04:09:14,"**Acting like you dont care what people think is a symptom of caring way too much.** &amp;nbsp; Listening to criticism and social feedback, and thinking about it objectively, on the other hand, is a symptom of deep self-confidence. &amp;nbsp; This kind of honest scrutiny is difficult because its when we feel the most fragile parts of our self-image are under attack that we get emotionally reactive. &amp;nbsp; Those fragile points of vulnerability are the parts of our identity we defend most vigorously. The flaws you need to become aware of most are those that are the hardest to accept because they dont fit into your self-concept. Accomplishing this is fundamentally challenging, but extremely powerful. &amp;nbsp; Not too long ago, my friends started to call me overly competitive. Instead of saying, What makes you think that? I would reply with an offhanded (and intentionally cocky) response like, A god does not compete with mortals. &amp;nbsp; I was sarcastic so I could avoid confronting the issue. I didnt respond with an open mind when I got called out on a bad social habit, that deep down, I knew I needed to change. I dealt with my exposed insecurity by brushing it under the rug with sarcasm. Addressing this issue with an open mind was the only way to overcome my biggest insecurities, but I blinded myself to the possibility that it was even an issue. &amp;nbsp; Months after I had begun getting called out on my hyper-competitiveness, I finally saw my insecurities rear their ugly head. I was in a small college writing class, and one student was answering most of the discussion questions. His answers were well thought-out and added substantial value to the discussion. But I got frustrated, I told myself he was an attention whore and that he should let other people contribute more. &amp;nbsp; In reality, he wasnt an attention whore. Most of the other students didnt even have something to contribute. I wasnt frustrated because he was hungry for attention, I was frustrated because I was hungry for attention. I saw the class as a social competition, and he was winning. I had an emotional need to be the main guy in the class. I was jealous that someone else was charismatic, engaging, and intelligent. I was butthurt by the fact that he was offering more to the discussion than I was. &amp;nbsp; Until I realized what I was doing in that class, all the emotions I felt and decisions I made because of my machismo-infused competitiveness went completely unnoticed by me. Beforehand, when people complained that I was too competitive, I consciously assumed they were jealous of me in some way (the irony is that even my thinking about my competitiveness was competitive without my awareness). &amp;nbsp; Blindspots to our own flaws are completely natural, and you cant expect to be so perfectly aware that you have a totally accurate self-image. However, it is possible to become more aware of your flaws and bad social habits, but it requires a counterintuitive approach. Remember that when you feel uncomfortable, the dialogue you tell yourself cannot be trusted because criticism and self-doubt put your ego on defense. Unfortunately, the voice in your head prioritizes the protection of your current self-image over open-minded self-reflection. &amp;nbsp; Instead, listen to your emotions. Whatever makes you emotionally reactive can become a goldmine for personal growth. When an interaction makes you angry, anxious, jealous, etc., thats when you can be sure you have insecure self-beliefs that you are not consciously aware of. Listen to your emotions much more closely than to the voice in your head. &amp;nbsp; Admit to yourself that the fact you are upset is telling you something that you probably dont want to hear. Once you come from this vulnerable, open-minded starting point, then and only then, you can start to accurately analyze what is causing you to feel emotional discomfort. &amp;nbsp; This process is difficult in a culture that teaches people to place blame on everyone but themselves. However, when you start assuming responsibility for your emotional reactions to people, situations, and criticism, you can accurately root out the instances when you are (at least partially) at fault. There are instances in which your emotional reactivity is warranted, but usually, emotional discomfort is indicative of something you should be working on internally. &amp;nbsp; What frustrates us about others tends to be what were afraid of in ourselves. If you hate men who regularly sleep with girls on the first date, most likely youre either secretly jealous and unable to admit this to yourself, or you think that what hes doing is disrespectful and youre afraid that youre capable of acting the same way if youre not careful. Either way, this is saying a lot about your values and your insecurities, and very little about the other person. &amp;nbsp; I have a friend who is extremely uncomfortable around anyone whos a bit socially awkward. He will complain about how weird some guys are and treat them like shit. In his mind, this treatment is fair; these socially awkward people deserve to be treated poorly because theyre awkward. But what he doesnt admit to himself is that he is terrified of being socially awkward himself. These people trigger him not because theyre socially awkward, but because hes afraid of the possibility that he might be socially awkward too. This is an example of what famed psychologist Carl Jung calls the shadow. The shadow is all of the pieces of our identity/ego that we keep hidden from ourselves. My friend is so terrified of being awkward, that he will not do anything that makes him feel vulnerable. In fact, he will regularly dare me to pull unusual stunts in public when we go out, like approaching a girl with an awkward pickup line (Is it hot in here? Or is that just the holy spirit burning inside of you?). &amp;nbsp; Numerous times after completing my challenge, I gave him a similar task and he always became visibly nervous and refuses to do it. To this day, he hasnt done a single thing that he thought was socially uncalibrated, even when offered money to do so as a bet. &amp;nbsp; His fear of being socially awkward is understandable (yet irrational), but what makes it so powerful is that he wont admit to himself that he has this fear. The only way he can come to terms with his own insecurities is by assuming that his emotional discomfort is reflective of his own flaws instead of placing the blame on others. &amp;nbsp; Realizations likes this catalyze significant change, yet this is always emotionally challenging. It requires a mindset shift towards your own negative emotions. You must realize that emotional resistance isnt something to avoid, but something to lean into and learn from. Negative emotions arent bad, theyre revealing a point of vulnerability in your own self-concept. &amp;nbsp; Negative emotions are signposts for your own neurotic and insecure beliefs, and theyre screaming at you to become aware of this to make a change. As soon as you see these emotions as signals, as opportunities for growth, they transform from something to be avoided, to something to be sought out purposefully.

I haven't felt this depressed in a while. I worked out today, I don't know if it's the fatigue or my emotional state. On Wednesday on that date with Sarah#4 I took the initiative and planned the second date, which was supposed to be today. I texted her and got nothing. I sent another text and nothing then. She told me that she was down for Saturday on our date on Wednesday. Nope. I was sitting in the coffee shop, reading and waiting to see if she would reply or anything. I'm going to be honest, getting ghosted like that hurts. Justwriting about it know is making me sad. Here I thought I was getting good but know I'm back to square one. I believe that is the reason why I'm down today. I know that here in TRP that you're not supposed to let the girl dictate your emotions. I tried, believe me to forget and approach others but my mind and emotional state was in the gutter. It's not oneitis, it's the fact that I've been tossed like a piece of trash on the floor. I hate this feeling, this feeling of vulnerability and the lack of power. When girls tell me straight up they are not interested I have more respect for them. A simple text doesn't take too long. I approached as always, tried this new mindset out of trying to build a connection. I approached this white girl. The conversation was great, eye contact needed work though. I got her number but for some reason I got this gut feeling the second I got her number it was a fake. Turned out it was, the whole interaction was great. She was invested and asked me questions. I stopped approaching after that. There were tons of gorgeous women today here in NYC on this nice day, I saw them as a waste of time. What's the point anymore? I feel burnt out but I know I'm in a plateau. A girl I met last week joined me for a cup of coffee today. She told me she wasn't interested in me romantically but wanted to be friends, I accepted her offer and asked her to join me. We chatted, that's it, no kino or nothing. I wanted to get my mind off everything today but couldn't stop thinking that I'm wasting my time talking to this girl. I just feel tired and mentally exhausted. It's hard to not be bitter but that's The Red Pill huh? Accepting that life is harsh and that you can expect the unexpected."
75,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Study: There aren't enough good men because they were raised by women,527,6h098k,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6h098k/study_there_arent_enough_good_men_because_they/,2017-06-14 00:36:46,"Feminism is a disease that afflicts everyone, including women, but its truly innocent victims are boys. Just learned about some interesting studies, posted at the NYT. Basically they argue that single motherhood weakened mostly the male children, because the sisters in such one parent families perform better in life than the brothers. In normal families, there is no difference or brothers perform better. In other words, the lack of father harms more the male child than the female child. Thus if you want to weaken men, push for single motherhood. Apparently, having a father is more important for boys. So the next time a woman tells you that there arent enough good men, you can answer her: there arent enough good men because they were raised by women. Begin Citation: In a 2016 paper, David Autor, an economist at M.I.T., and four co-authors, measured academic and economic outcomes of brothers and sisters in Florida born in the decade between 1992 and 2002. For boys and girls raised in two-parent households, there were only modest differences between the sexes in terms of success at school, and boys tended to earn more than their sisters in early adulthood. Among children raised in single-parent households, however, boys performed significantly less well than their sisters in school, and their employment rate as young adults was lower. Relative to their sisters, Autor and his collaborators wrote, boys born to disadvantaged families  with disadvantage measured here by mothers marital status and education  have higher rates of disciplinary problems, lower achievement scores, and fewer high-school completions. When the children in the study reached early adulthood, the same pattern emerged in employment: Employment rates of young women are nearly invariant to family marital status, while the employment rates of young adult men from non-married families are eight to ten percentage points below those from married families at all income levels. Autor and his co-authors conclude that family structure is more consequential for the skills development and labor market outcomes of boys than girls. From another perspective altogether, Allan Schore, a professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at the U.C.L.A. School of Medicine, explores the slower development among boys in right-brain attachment functions. This maturational delay in brain function, Schore writes in an essay that was published earlier this year in the Infant Mental Health Journal, All Our Sons: The Developmental Neurobiology and Neuroendocrinology of Boys at Risk, makes boys more vulnerable over a longer period of time to stressors in the social environment and toxins in the physical environment that negatively impact right-brain development. This vulnerability, in turn, makes boys more susceptible to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and conduct disorders as well as the epigenetic mechanisms that can account for the recent widespread increase of these disorders in U.S. culture. Schore argues that a major factor in rising dysfunction among boys and men in this country is the failure of the United States to provide longer periods of paid parental leave, with the result that many infants are placed in day care when they are six weeks old. Starting day care at six weeks, Schore writes, is the exact time of the initiation of the postnatal testosterone surge found only in males. Schore notes that research has documented that boys more so than girls raised in single-mother families show twice the rate of behavioral problems than do boys in two-parent families and argues that a mis-attuned insecure mother can be a source of considerable relational stress, especially when the immature male toddler is expressing high levels of dysregulated aggression or fear. When a child is 18 to 24 months old, fathers play a crucial role, Schore writes, pointing to the male infants attachment transactions with the father in the second year, when he is critically involved in not only androgen-controlled rough-and-tumble play but in facilitating the male (and female) toddlers aggression regulation. This same period (1824 months) involves the initiation of a critical period of growth in the left hemisphere, and so the paternal attachment system of father-son interactions would presumably forge an androgenic imprint in the toddlers evolving left-brain circuits, including the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, allowing for his regulation of the male toddlers testosterone-induced aggression (terrible twos).

76,vulnerability,TheRedPill,How to be confident,1007,66j6b4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/66j6b4/how_to_be_confident/,2017-04-21 03:20:56,"The internet is full of articles and videos that supposedly teach how to be confident. Most of this shit is useless because confidence is an incredibly complex subject and takes sustained work to develop and maintain. There is no magic formula for confidence, and it can easily be lost. This article is my attempt, but dont rely on it. Confidence is a complex mixture of positive thoughts and emotions. Actions create emotions, emotions create thoughts, and emotions and thoughts together create action. The emotions-thoughts-actions axis can either be a virtuous cycle, each improving the others, or it can be a negative cycle, each making the next thing shittier. I seek here to explain how to create a virtuous cycle of confidence. The first part of this article discusses confidence in general, and the second part discusses confidence in the context of getting laid. I can summarize the main points of this essay as follows: 1) Confidence is faith that you will succeed at whatever you do. To have faith, you must see reality as governed by rationality and logic, and that all you need to do is use this rationality to achieve your goals. You must not see as reality as out to get you. 2) To become confident you must re-wire your brains reward pathways such that you feel excited when you see a new challenge, rather than anxious and despairing. 3) To re-wire your brains reward pathways you must continually undertake new challenges outside your comfort zone and succeed at them. 4) To power through challenges, you must feel joy. 5) To feel confident, you must not feel controlled by anybody, especially people your mind perceives as alpha males. **Confidence is faith** The word confidence comes from the Latin con (with) + fidens (faith) (literally with faith). In other words, confidence is faith you will succeed in whatever you try to do. Faith is a belief that something is true even if you dont have hard information confirming its truth. If I knew for a fact that a girl liked me, and I approached her, thats not confidence. If I approach a girl I already know likes me, Im no more confident than a guy eating a doughnut because he knows it will taste good. Obviously, it is easier to have confidence and faith when you have information to base it on. Everyone is confident the sun will rise tomorrow because it has risen every day of their life. But if you only base your confidence on things you are sure of you will live in a narrow comfort zone like most people do. Most people only feel confident if they already know they will succeed or if theyve seen somebody else overcome that challenge. There are doctors who can do brain surgery but are deathly afraid to approach a woman in a bar. There are rock stars who can play a show in front of thousands of people but break a sweat trying to do their taxes. But why have faith? Why should you believe you will succeed at getting rich, getting laid, and being happy if most people fail at those things and youve never succeeded at them? Heres why: Just having faith, by itself, makes you more likely to succeed. And the more faith you have, the more likely you are to succeed. If that sounds like the plot of that dumbass book The Secret, it is. Its also the foundation of many religions and philosophies. But there is a rational reason why this is true that doesnt depend on God or magic. Faith helps you succeed because the main thing that stops you from achieving your goals is your own emotions. Most shit is a lot easier than you think it is. Getting hot girls to fuck you? Becoming a billionaire? Brain surgery? That stuff is hard, but how hard is it really? For almost anything you want to do, there is a stupid, fat, douchebag somewhere that is awesome at that thing. There are literally millions of people that are dumber and lazier than you that easily do the thing that you think is so hard. Most of the time, the challenge is in your own mind. A famous entrepreneur once told me that you can learn almost any business in 4 months. Malcolm Gladwell says you can become world class in any field if you do it for 10,000 hours, which is only about 4 years of working a full time job  not really that long to become the best in the world. As far as anybody can tell, the world is governed by rational rules that predictably operate based on logic. To succeed at anything, all you need to do is learn these rules and use them to succeed. Viewed this way, the only challenge is our own emotions: we get bored, afraid, distracted, impatient, anxious, intimidated, depressed, overworked, stressed out, sleepy, obsessed with the wrong details, lazy, angry, frustrated, etc I call these the despairing emotions. You can take any task, break it up into a series of little parts, put one foot in front of the other, and eventually succeed. All you need to do is be rational, be prepared, and put the time and effort in. Everything in the world works like this  there is no magic. Even luck is very limited compared to what we make happen. Usually when we think something is too hard for us, our despair is hijacking our rational brain and making us think thoughts that we believe are rational but are really just justifications and expressions of our despair. When a heroin addict makes excuses to start doing heroin again, or when an entrepreneur decides to quit their business because its too hard, they think they are being influenced by rational thoughts, but really they are just being influenced by despair. Faith and confidence overcome our weak emotions. We power through challenges because our motivated emotions outweigh our despair, or at the very least, our intellectual thoughts manage and control our despairing emotions so that they do not cripple us. Successful people feel excitement and pleasure at doing their work whereas unsuccessful people feel fear, anxiety, dread, boredom, etc And humans are wired to seek good feelings, so when we feel depressed and anxious we quickly run to fix is our shitty feelings  drugs, alcohol, porn, and other distractions. Every time you encounter a challenge, your brain subconsciously does a complex cost-benefit analysis. You calculate the chance of success and the good feelings that come with it, and weigh that against the chance of failure and the bad feelings that come from failure. If your brain feels like you are more likely to feel bad, your despairing emotions will cripple you and make you not want to do it. Of course, this is bullshit. Your brain usually has no idea what the actual chances of success and failure are, nor does it know how you will actually feel after you succeed or fail, so its complex calculation is based on feelings from the past. Confidence requires rewiring your brain so that when it does the cost-benefit analysis, the excited emotions outweigh the despairing emotions. The easiest way to rewire your reward system is to succeed at things, so that, going forward, your brain feels like it will succeed again. But like I said, if you base your confidence on past successes you will never grow. True, ultimate, confidence is when you have faith that you will succeed at ANYTHING you try, even if youve never done it and it is something most people would think is insanely difficult. Im not selling magic. There are some things you will never accomplish, no matter how confident you are. You cant build a perpetual motion machine because it is probably impossible under the rules of physics. Most of you will never fuck Kate Upton, no matter how much you think you can. There is nothing wrong with thinking that something is impossible, or not worth the effort, or not the right thing for you at that time, but you must make that determination based on a rational calculation rather than your feelings. Most of what we think is impossible is actually very doable, we have just been tricked by our despair. Sometimes we just do not have enough information to make a rational calculation, and we must leap into the darkness. My dad had a theory that stupid people were often more successful than smart people, because smart people did intelligent cost-benefit calculations whenever they decided to take a life risk, whereas stupid people just jumped ahead and took the risk. When we leap into the darkness we must have faith that we will succeed. We also need faith that if we fail we will be fine and that failure helps us because it lightens the darkness and gives us guidance for the next try. We also need a plan to land on our feet if we fail. The rest of this article is dedicated to trying to teach you how to rewire your brain to feel excited about new challenges rather than scared. You can try to grit your teeth and fight your emotions 24/7, but you should also work to transform your emotions. **Faith and reality** Your goal is to re-wire your reward system so that you feel excited tackling any new challenge, even if it is outside your comfort zone. You need faith because you have no way of knowing for sure that you will succeed at any new challenge and without faith you will be crippled with uncertainty, anxiety and existential despair. Faith is tied to your view of reality. Philosophers and psychologists have long understood that people have a tendency to subconsciously feel like reality has intentions like a person. People will feel like the world is out to get them, a small group of elders control everything, life hates them, they have bad luck, or they have demons, etc Its obviously stupid to say I think reality has thoughts and feelings and hates me, but thats how a lot of people subconsciously think. I call this the anthromorphization fallacy. I believe this fallacy comes from our ape mind. Apes evolved to obey the alpha male, because it is better for the tribe to have one leader rather than everybody doing their own thing. To enforce this obedience, evolution produced anxiety, which we feel whenever we feel like we are disobeying or upsetting the alpha male. Anxiety and depression are designed to keep us in line and make us feel powerless, paralyzed and weak whenever we want to do something that might offend the alpha male. Human are apes with rational brains that magnify and distort our ape feelings. We can subconsciously see the entire world as an alpha male, and feel a generalized anxiety about everything. This is why some people are negative about everything, scared of simple tasks like driving, randomly freak out at small things, and just generally have dark thoughts. Religion tries to fight the anthromorphization fallacy by pretending like reality is governed by God, which is essentially an alpha male that controls everything in reality and will be nice to you if you do some easy, meaningless rituals. I believe in God and I think it helps my anxiety. If you dont want to believe in God, thats fine, but at the very least you have to stop yourself from thinking that reality has a mind and it wants you to fail. At most, you can rationally say that, aside from ascertainable laws (the law of gravity, E=mc2, etc), reality is basically random and chaotic and is neutral towards you. And if you are currently alive and breathing, you have to admit that reality has been at least somewhat good to you. Once you accept that reality is not your enemy, and may even be your friend, you can have faith that you will succeed at anything. Your despairing emotions will try to trick you into thinking you will fail, but they are irrational, often caused by the fear of some mental alpha male that may not even exist. How would your weak, human brain know anything about the nature of reality anyway? Many people, including myself, have realized the falsity of our despairing emotions after using psychedelic drugs, which chemically turn off our despairing emotions and make us feel like the universe loves us. Im not saying that you can simply turn off your despairing emotions by simply believing that reality is your friend. You cant turn off any emotion that is rooted in your biology, any more than you can turn off your sex drive. But the first step in controlling a demon is realizing that its there and thats it a demon. If you practice mindfulness, you will catch yourself being lied to by your despairing emotions and you will realize your thoughts are irrational. I dont want to overstate my case here. A subconscious cosmic alpha male is not the only source of despair. A lot of things can create anxiety and depression, and science has not even completely figured out those emotions. Anxiety can be caused by chemical balances, living in a dirty house, post-traumatic stress, bad life experiences, etc... But I believe that fear of alpha males, real and imagined, is a big source of despair for many people. **Real alpha males** People have a subconscious fear of the cosmic alpha male that controls the world partly because actual alpha males bullied them, made them feel inferior, and induced subconscious beta emotions. These guys include your father, your teachers, your coach, your pastor, the cool kids at your high school, the President of the United States, the Federal Reserve bank, the media, society, Brad Pitt, and famous celebrities whose art and persona is designed to make regular guys feel inferior. These are just regular guys trying to make it through life just like you, but their ego, selfishness, stupidity, negligence, and bad judgment has scarred your self-esteem. These guys arent necessarily alpha males, but they felt like it to you, at least when they affected you. Their combined efforts have congealed in your brain to give you a fear of alpha males and reality in general. Women may have also made you feel emasculated, not because they wanted to emasculate you but because they were testing you to see if you were worthy of their delicious pussy. All men fear some alpha male. The head of the Crips gang in Los Angeles is the alpha male of the thug/gangster world, but he subconsciously sees a nerdy banker as the alpha male because the nerdy banker makes much more money and lives a better life than him, and the Crip leader is too scared to go to school and try to compete with the nerdy banker. The nerdy banker, in turn, sees another group of men as alpha to him, etc A key to becoming confident is releasing yourself from the control that both real and imagined alpha males have over you. To do this, you must not give a single fuck what anybody thinks about you. Your actions should be governed by truth and a rational analysis of what is best for you, not your need to feel validated and accepted. The moment you care what others think of you, you constrain your behavior to gain their approval and feel despair when they deny it. And when you constrain your behavior, you show to yourself, them and the world that you can be perturbed and thrown off of your mission. And if you can be thrown off of your mission, then you no longer have the ability to succeed at anything. Many men link confidence to their tangible existence. A lot of guys say to me: Im not confident because Im fat, or I dont have enough money, or Im awkward, etc Thats the wrong way to look at it. Your confidence should not be based on any tangible thing you have, but rather your inability to be controlled, because a man who cannot be controlled and can also obtain anything. If a woman said to you that she only feels confident when shes wearing make-up, you wouldnt think that that woman was confident: you would think that she is deeply insecure. A truly confident woman would be confident even if she was in a disfiguring accident that made her face look like ground beef. True confidence is the intellectual belief and the emotional feeling that you are awesome just because you are you, and that you will succeed because you dont care what anybody thinks, you cant be controlled, and will not fall victim to despair. Confidence has its own intrinsic value: I feel confident because I know I am confident. I know I am confident because I dont care what other people think, and therefore nobody can perturb me from my mission, and if nobody can perturb me from my mission, I am guaranteed to succeed. **Happiness** Happiness is both a result and cause of confidence. As I said earlier, humans are wired to seek good feelings, so if you are unhappy your brain will get distracted and chase sources of cheap happiness (TV, women, drugs, trashy internet, etc...). Your goal is to get your happiness from accomplishing your goals and defeating challenges, rather than cheap happiness. If you face every challenge with joy, you will be more motivated. You may be a fundamentally unhappy person. Maybe youre depressed, or anxious, or have had a hard life. But there must have been at least one time in your life when you felt joy. If you can induce that feeling in yourself when you are pursuing your goals, or at least fake it, you will do better. One of my favorite quotes is from a rabbi who said that how can I feel joy when my house has burnt down? I feel sad for a little, and then when I start rebuilding it, I feel joy with every brick I lay. The upshot of this is that you should always be having fun. No matter how hard your life is, or what bad thing just happened to you, you need to have a social schedule where you are going out, doing things that make you feel good, fucking girls, hanging out with friends, etc... Obviously, you shouldnt let your fun times take over your life or do anything self-destructive, but I disagree with the idea that success requires sustained misery. Being happy also requires eating well, getting enough sleep, and eliminating sources of negativity and distraction from your life. If you have a friend who consistently makes you feel like shit, or a woman who brings you more pain than happiness, cut them out. They are bad for you. Happiness is a result of confidence because confident people are more successful, and your confidence proves to you that you can succeed at anything. Getting rid of your fear of the alpha male also makes you happy because you no longer need to rely on anybody else for happiness. Human beings are actually very simple beings. All we need is a little bit of food, decent shelter, one vagina to put your dick in (you should reject the societal notion that you cant be happy unless you fuck lots of girls), and love. All of our other fake desires are rooted in our need for the love of others. We mostly desire luxury things like nice cars, mansions or designer clothes because we think it will cause other people to love us and care about us. A truly confident man knows that he will be loved no matter what he has or who he is, because his value comes from being imperturbable and a model for others. And if people want to deny him love based on his material circumstances, then thats their problem, not his. Im not saying that nice cars, mansions and nice clothes are bad things. I enjoy all those things. Im also not saying that women dont care about tangibles. Women definitely do care about how you look, how you dress, how much money you have, etc... There are some women that will just never fuck a short, bald poor guy no matter how much game he has. But your own confidence and self-esteem should not depend on your tangibles. You should live your most awesome life. If girls like you, great. If not, no problem. **Can you really not care what people think?** Its impossible to truly not care what anybody thinks of you. Human beings are social animals, and we evolved to form emotional connections with other people and to care what they think of us. We need sex, affection and human contact. The only way to truly not care about the opinions of others is to either be a psychopath or a hermit that lives in the woods. Im not saying that you should cut off contact from all other humans. Im saying you should engage in mutually beneficial relationships with people, where you exchange the things humans need to exchange (love, friendship, affection, fun times, etc), WITHOUT LETTING THEM CONTROL YOU and without becoming submissive. To prevent people from controlling you, or abusing your, or manipulating you, or taking advantage of you, you must have a strong set of boundaries. Boundaries are rules for yourself that you will not allow others to break. A confident man is confident his rules are morally correct and makes others bend to his moral guidelines, not vice versa. If you have faith in your principles and stand by them, you cannot be manipulated by women or by society into acting against your own interests, doing the wrong thing, or chasing stupid trophies like nice cars and shit. I'm not here to push a certain type of morality on you, and I think many set of rules can be ""correct"" depending on your situatiion, the people you are dealing with, and your personal preferences. What's important is not having this or that set of rules, but generally having unbreakable principles. You should constantly reevaluate your rules and changing them if they are ""wrong"" and/or not conducive to the type of life you want to live. You should also be open to reasonable arguments by third parties that your rules may be wrong. **The good life** An important part of being confident is having a clear vision of what you consider to be the good life. Nobody can control you if you are happily pursuing the good life. This vision is a set of priorities and beliefs about the world that guide what you seek and care about. For example, if a hot girl tries to pressure me to do cocaine I say no because cocaine contradicts my vision of the good life because of its harmful effects. This sounds like third grade health education, but it is amazing that many adults can be peer pressured simply because they dont have their own vision of the good life. I know rich, successful adult men that have become cokeheads because the beautiful women they were pressured by hot girls to do it. Its absolutely fucking incredible that a millionaire Silicon Valley CEO can be peer pressured by a bartender into doing cocaine but it happens all the fucking time. And because that guy had no vision of the good life, he is now addicted and does cocaine even when those girls are not around. Your boundaries and your vision of the good life are connected. I set boundaries because I am pursuing a certain life, and if you get in the way, you are dismissed. For example, my vision of the good life involves waking up early to work out and work on my businesses. Many people (usually trashy girls not doing anything useful with their lives) dont understand that vision and try to pressure me into staying out late. No matter how beautiful they are or how close I am to getting pussy, I say no and go home. No matter how hot she is and how much I think I cant find anybody else like her that will respect my rules, I keep the faith. Your vision of the good life should have a place for all of your pleasures and pursuits. I like fucking hot girls, but I also like getting enough sleep, eating well, going to fun concerts, being around positive people, succeeding at my business, talking about deep, intellectual things I am interested in, etc Understanding the good life also makes you feel better about your shortcomings. Women are part of the good life, but you dont need to fuck the hottest girl and you definitely dont need to get every girl you like. If you think that happiness requires you to be 60 or drive a Ferrari or bang X girls a year, you lose your confidence if you dont have those things. If your vision of the good life is simpler, however, you cant be shamed and guilted if you dont have those things. **Why are women attracted to confidence?** First of all, everyone is attracted to confidence. Nobody wants to be around an insecure, sad, moping sack of shit. And nobody likes to be around somebody that is easily controlled. Humans are wired to reach for something higher than us, not somebody beneath us that doesnt challenge us or help us grow. That said, women have a special desire for a confident man. Why? Because women have babies and are physically weaker than men, women evolved to seek a strong, powerful man who can make a credible commitment to protect her and her baby until the baby reaches a certain age. A protectors commitment is only credible if he cannot be thrown off of his mission, whatever that mission is. If a protector becomes emotional, dishonest, distracted, or submissive, he can no longer be trusted to protect. In other words, if a protector can be controlled by others or crippled by despair, his commitment is not credible and the woman is vulnerable. It does not matter how confident you actually are, but whether you can display that confidence to a woman. Confidence is performative. A woman wants to see you confidently pursue a mission and not be perturbed and more importantly, not show despair. Women can subconsciously sense despair in a man. She wants to see you be a brick wall. Women also subconsciously know that the thing that is most likely to perturb a man is a woman, so she will purposely try to perturb you to see how you react. If you even flinch, she will question your emotional credibility. This is what we call a shit test. A big problem is that men meet women in social situations where they are drinking and having fun, so women do not see men confidently pursue their mission. For most men, when they go out, women are their mission. But fixating on women subconsciously causes you to be controlled by women, reducing your attractiveness. This is why DJs and bartenders are more attractive to women  they are actually doing something rather than just drooling over them. **Your place in the tribe** On a subconscious level, women want a guy who does not appear to be controlled by the tribe. This is part of the reason women like bad boys  a bad boy tingles the same receptors that an alpha male tingles because the bad boy does not conform to anybodys rules and does not feel like he is controlled by any other male. This is irrational, of course  most bad boys are losers and the opposite of an actual alpha male. But we are talking about emotions here, not rationality. The alpha male does what he wants, and he doesnt rely on anybody else for anything, either physical or emotional. He is the only one that cannot be controlled. Sure, the alpha male does have the most tangible things (food and resources) but the alpha male isnt thinking about that. The true alpha male is not the biggest, loudest, meanest, toughest guy: its the guy who literally does not give a single fuck and cannot be controlled. Its the guy who walks in a party with a ridiculous ugly neon green floppy hat. Its the guy who tells an embarrassing story about himself that most people would be too afraid to tell. Its the guy who does something thats a little off, not because hes weird or has problems, but because he just lives in his own reality. The alpha male is totally relaxed, calm, confident in what hes doing, and is never, ever, perturbed by anything anybody does, especially women. If you walk into a bar or nightclub, you see a bizarre scene. Otherwise confident, successful, manly men are selling their souls. They are begging beautiful women to buy them drinks, listening intently to their stupid stories and agreeing with their stupid opinions, begging for their attention, waiting for them as they talk to other men, etc These men instantly lose credibility to women because they are begging to be accepted and are easily controlled. In other words, these men are experiencing the same emotional anguish that the women experience, which turns women off. Women want to escape their emotional anguish, not be with a guy that is also experiencing it. I wrote an article about how women are not attracted to men that are overly emotionally invested in them. See here: URL A major reason emotionally invested people are unattractive is because they are dependent on another person for their good feelings, therefore making them controlled. And women are fundamentally not attracted to men who can be controlled. **Bitchy women** A lot of guys confidence melts around bitchy women. I, however, love bitches. A woman is bitchy for one of two reasons: 1) she has suffered some trauma in her life that has damaged her, or 2) she regularly turns men into weak puddles, so she turns up the bitchiness to make sure she can find a mate whose confidence is rock solid. For women that are #1, you should just run. You are not her therapist and cannot help them. But women that are #2 are a fun challenge. Whenever a woman is a bitch to me, I know I am on my road to fucking her and all I need to do is keep my cool and not be perturbed. Bitchiness is just a front to hide their intense insecurity and anxiety. Confident, happy, well-adjusted people act polite and friendly, even if they are being hit on by somebody they dont think is attractive. All hostility and negativity is rooted in fear, defensiveness, and your own perceived vulnerability. Women are crippled with insecurity and anxiety about how men, women and society in general feel about them and have an intense desire to be accepted. Next time you go to a club, put your horniness aside and just focus on the body language of these bitchy women. They are afraid. They are insecure. They are awkward. They are dorks. They are easily controlled, if they could just find somebody with the balls to try to control them. Even when they try to talk tough or cool, its a bluff. A hot woman acting like a bitch is similar to a 16 year old nerd with a pocket protector and acne talking shit to a prison convict. He knows he is faking it, and the moment the prison convict calls his bluff he will back down in fear and humiliation. Not all women are bitches. I know some confident women, but these women are confident because they have other things going for them. They are smart, they have accomplished things, they are fun to hang out with, etc But whenever a woman tries to act like shes the shit just because shes hot, she is faking it every single time. **How to act around women** Lets do some logic. Women are attracted to confidence. Confidence is faith that you will succeed. Therefore, women are attracted to men who have faith they will succeed in fucking them. In other words, women want a guy to act like he already knows she will fuck him. Of course, you dont actually know whether she will fuck you. But nevertheless, you must act as if you KNOW she will fuck you. You must bluff as if you know she will say yes. And even if you get rejected, you must move on to the next girl with the same confidence. Now the question becomes: if you truly knew from the bottom of your heart you could fuck a girl, how would you act? You wouldnt supplicate, or beg, or act needy, or even do anything really. If you KNEW you could fuck a girl, you would do nothing. Of course, you should talk to her and be nice so that you dont make her feel bad, and you would engage with her to the extent that she says or does anything interesting or funny. But the moment she does something negative, shitty, or boring, you immediately lose interest because you dont need to put up with her bullshit. Unlike a lot of other PUA blogs, I am not going to feed you a bunch of lines of what a confident guy would say. The fact is, confidence is an emotional state, and you either have it or you dont. And girls can sense it because it is very hard to fake your emotions, especially if you are hanging out with a girl for a long time. **Humility** Releasing yourself from the mental slavery of the alpha male sounds great, but it is actually very dangerous. Most people in our society can only function if they are being guided by a superior: society, your dad, the government, your boss, etc... They need the anxiety induced by the alpha male to stay focused and not go off and get drunk and play video games. But if you want to be a truly confident, self-actualized man, you need to be able to motivate yourself when there is no alpha male swinging an axe over your head. Not only must you be your own alpha male, but you must cultivate a positive humility, where you listen to men that are smarter and more powerful than you, not because of your irrational ape emotions, but because they are smarter than you and they are helping you improve. If you look at history, a lot of times when men get a ton of power they go crazy (see kings, dictators, rock stars, Mike Tyson, etc...) because they dont have the anxiety of the alpha male controlling them but they also dont have the humility to stay focused and keep their head on straight.

The consequences of getting this mentality wrong are: **Texting too often (becoming her text buddy):** -Because you are an alpha and you feel like texting her so you do and have a long conversation with her through the phone. Wrong, I suggest reading Woujos posts on neediness and the emotions you need to keep in check. I enjoy texting, but I learned the hard way it is better to not have a constant chit chat with girls through the phone. **Forgetting about game:** -Lately there is a trend where people say just say you think she is cute, this might be good for guys with anxiety that cannot approach, so they can train themselves to be outcome independent. You do not need a complicated/funny/clever Opener, but if you have a good Opener that can maximize your results with her (getting into her pants) that would be great. -Models was a great read, but people usually confuse the word vulnerability (no being needy) with show emotional weakness. Telling her about your depression, problems and existential questions will not help you out. Chill dude, remain calm and keep your emotions in check(as Roissy said: you need to be an unshakeable oak tree). -Smiling too much. I will get a lot of negative opinions on this one. The Endorsed contributor that recently made a post on the sadness phase (the girl with the Sad eyes) has a post on that and was down voted to the oblivion. Also Roissy from Chateau Heartiste did a post on that, basically stating that not smiling at the beginning is bad and smiling too much during the interaction is also bad. There is a difference between a genuine smile (because you are really happy) and a socially fake smile which usually seeks approval from others like a dog. I am not joking, try it yourself and keep it balanced. -Remember what youve read on body language, do not lean, slow down, she is there is qualify herself to you; chill. She wants to chase you, be a challenge. When you apply all of this at the beginning is like putting a cheat code to a video game, you will say to yourself I cannot believe this is working but then you learn to accept it and it becomes part of you. **Getting experience the wrong way:** I know the feeling, you want experience with girls, hell, you are even willing to fail hard and thats good, but the first couple of times when you get a girl to like you, you mess up everything by hamstering things like I will text her, I will tell her my problems, I will be emotional, I will always be available for her, I will save her and emotionally invest on her just because you want to gain experience with girls and you want to test the theory yourself to see what happens and then you go the AskTrp sub to complain. This is not rocket science; the laws are on this sub and have been repeated a lot. Keep applying them; hold your frame. **Fucking a girl you do not like.** I had an experience with a girl that I wish it to no man or woman. This chubby girl was hitting on me; I was in dryspell for a couple of weeks so she invited me to fuck. I said yes, but I was not attracted to her. So when we got together and she tried to kiss me it was disgusting, she did not smell, but her natural smell and breath was nasty for me. I was trying to avoid her, but she kept sticking her tongue on my mouth to the point I wanted to throw up and I had to think about other girls. She rides me for a while and then I could not get it up; I took the blame and made up an excuse that these condoms are too thick etc, so we better leave. So we did. I believe she is emotionally ok. But if you are ever in doubt as a male to fuck a girl (because she might not be attractive enough for you) I suggest you to not do it. I just wonder if I had ever been that disgusting for a girl in the past. However, that day, I made a promise to myself: I will do my best in the gym, I will not be needy ever again(because that shit is dangerous), I will be a sexually attractive male. Try to have a nice personality too. *Not lifting (how can some people hamster themselves into going to the Asktrp sub and asking if they should go to the GYM). **I met this girl on Tinder and(?)** **Reading and reading and not applying the knowledge in your everyday life.** **Conclusion: Remember your training soldier.** "
78,vulnerability,TheRedPill,The Rational Male  State Control,107,6bslw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6bslw8/the_rational_male_state_control/,2017-05-18 09:55:24,"Essay: URL Excerpt: Likewise, mens emotive states run a different gamut than that of women. As I mentioned in the Anger Bias essay, men are less predisposed to emotional states that women believe are beneficial in their own experience. In a feminine-correct social state, where womens experiences define the norm, and in a social constructivist perspective, this amounts to a repression of emotions. The idea is that an overly masculine acculturation of boys leads them to holding back the emotions that women tend to build their lives around. The real truth is that men process emotions, and prioritize the expression of those emotions, much more as a result of our own mental firmware than social repression. Thats not to say there isnt some social influence over teaching men to learn self-control over those emotions. As I just mentioned, young men have been taught for millennia to have state control by each other, their mentors and their peers, but since the time of the sexual revolution and the rise of a feminine primary social order this state control has been turned into a net negative. So, in a sense, young men of the last 4-5 generations are caught between pleasing two masters. To be considered the equal that feminine-primary egalitarianism would have them be they must first get in touch with their emotions. However, the only emotions they are taught are valid are those that make them more alike and identifying with women; nurturing, crying, expressing vulnerability, etc., essentially anything not characteristic of conventional masculinity. This of course has the effect of women subconsciously perceiving them as they would other women, and not potential intimates. Essentially, this aligning with womens experience of emotion desexualizes men. Yet, on the other hand, men are expected to repress their emotions in terms of having a state control that appeals to womens Hypergamous need for security. Thus, the emotions that might better serve men in a survivalist utility are exactly those which feminine-correct society considers negative or toxic and therefore must be controlled. The problem inherent in all of this is that it is feminine-primacy that is defining what mens experience of emotion is acceptable despite it being the cause of so much of womens frustration with men. As the saying goes, women get the men they deserve and the emotive, masculine-confused men of today are simply the result of a social order thats standardized the female experience as the definition of what blank-slate equalism should be for both sexes  but really as a means of social control for women whose experience is defined by an unsolvable need for certain security. None of this is to say men ought not to express themselves emotionally or avoid being artists and poets or whatever in favor of some uninspired stoicism, but it is to say that Red Pill aware men should also be aware of the feminine-primary influences informing their expectations of expressing any or no emotion. That may seem like a drawn out way of saying own your emotions, but its my belief that for men to reclaim conventional masculinity it will require them to honestly assess why and how they choose to express or control their emotional states based on their own definition of what is correct from a male perspective, not the female perspective."
79,vulnerability,TheRedPill,The Unexpected Cause of All Your Insecurities (A guide to deep social confidence part two),186,6c1qxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6c1qxz/the_unexpected_cause_of_all_your_insecurities_a/,2017-05-19 15:28:46,"**Its not your flaws that you are aware of that cause insecurity and self-esteem issues. Its the flaws youre not aware of, the self-defeating beliefs you dont even know you have.** &amp;nbsp; Nobel Prize winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman explains this problem brilliantly, Were blind to our blindness. We have very little idea of how little we know. Were not designed to know how little we know. &amp;nbsp; The harsh truth is that your analysis of whats causing your social problems is inaccurate, limited, and completely biased. If you want to make a change, you must first learn the true cause of your social problems, understanding this is the foundation that any social self-improvement is built on. &amp;nbsp; Self-confidence and charisma (or the lack of them) are largely the results of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Psychologists have found that social expectations become social outcomes. This has been shown time and again by research on a powerful psychological force known as the Pygmalion Effect. &amp;nbsp; Imagine a babysitter is warned by a friend that the kid shes going to babysit is a real shithead, hes impatient, annoying, and arrogant. After hearing this, the babysitter becomes anxious about meeting this kid. When she finally meets him, just as expected, hes horrible. This kid wont listen to her, he has a short temper, and he treats her with total contempt. &amp;nbsp; Theres something the babysitter was totally blind to. The kid she babysat wasnt usually a shithead, he was usually a perfectly normal kid. He acted like a shithead because she expected him to act like a shithead. Psychologists believe this happens because when we expect people to act a certain way, we treat them differently (often without our awareness). The person thats a total asshole around you might be a saint around someone else. &amp;nbsp; This matches common sense, if youre a Trump supporter and you met Hillary Clinton, youd probably treat her very differently than a supporter of hers would, and she would probably treat you differently than she would treat a supporter of hers. &amp;nbsp; We dont just cause people to treat us differently based on our expectations of them. Our negative beliefs about ourselves cause other people to treat us differently too. If you dont respect yourself, your behavior will reflect this (and people will treat you with less respect. &amp;nbsp; Someone who is self-pitying gets pity, not respect. If you believe youre a weird who doesnt deserve to be liked, youre going to act uncomfortable around people. You will be shy and closed off, this behavior will repel people, and as you notice that people dont seem to like you, youre going to build even more evidence that youre a weirdo who doesnt deserve to be liked. &amp;nbsp; Then youre going to act even more shy and closed-off around others, and this pattern repeats itself ad naseum. If you were aware this was happening, it would be easy enough to deal with, but we dont notice this happening. We only live in our own mind which can easily become a vacuum chamber of negative, self-defeating beliefs. &amp;nbsp; We cant understand how a better mindset would change our life for a similar reason that a deaf person cant really understand how hearing would change their life. &amp;nbsp; We dont have the proper context to understand what our mindset is doing to us until we become aware that our mindset is damaging us and is negative in ways that it doesnt need to be. Lack of this awareness is why you dont think its your behavior thats repelling people, but that its the fact that youre a weirdo thats repelling people. &amp;nbsp; Without knowing it, we become our own worst enemy. We might believe people are assholes, but we dont realize theyre just reflecting our own beliefs back at us. We might believe were not worthy of affection, but we dont realize that we wall ourselves from vulnerability and make it impossible to receive affection. &amp;nbsp; We might believe we dont deserve a girlfriend, but we dont realize that we could easily get a girlfriend if we just took the right actions. In countless ways, we fuck ourselves, and because our brain is constantly looking for an explanation for our problems, we blame those problems on something we dont think we can control to free ourselves of responsibility. &amp;nbsp; We do this because its easy, like it or not, our brain is designed to take the easy route, and facing insecurities is never easy. The truth is that you are in control of (and therefore responsible) for all your social shortcomings, but its intrinsically difficult to notice the damage youre doing to yourself. &amp;nbsp; Changing yourself isnt hard because it takes so much willpower or hard work, change is hard because it requires openminded introspection and honest questioning of your own thoughts, behaviors, and values. &amp;nbsp; **Case Study: A Man Who Fucked Himself Over Without Knowing it** &amp;nbsp; I had a friend, Nick, who was an interesting case, he was good looking by societal standards, 62, blonde hair blue eyes, athletic build. He generally seemed socially confident, you would never guess that he had a crippling anxiety towards meeting women. &amp;nbsp; He had hooked up with some women by getting wasted and trolling the bars, but they were rarely the kind of women he wanted in his life. Still, he would take what he could get and date the first girl who would sleep with him, once he dated a girl he wasnt physically attracted to for an entire year. &amp;nbsp; After a few years of drunken debauchery, he met a girl who actually met his standards, she was athletic, ambitious, confident, caring, everyone loved her.He was super nervous when he met her, but with some nudging from his friends he managed to go on a few dates with her. After they started dating, he began acting incredibly neurotic. &amp;nbsp; Because of his nerves about this girl, he decided he needed to meet other women. He found a girl on tinder, slept with her, then on the same day (while the tinder girl was still at our house), he invited his crush to come by. &amp;nbsp; His dream girl came over, and the situation quickly deteriorated into sitcom-level awkwardness as Nick told his dream girl that he had slept with this other girl. Unsurprisingly, this turned his dream girl off, and they stopped dating. &amp;nbsp; A couple months later, Nick met his dream girl again, he was afraid to approach her, but another friend and I convinced him to do it. Surprisingly, she was happy to see him and they made plans to hang out again. Nick never followed through with these plans. &amp;nbsp; Nick hasnt slept with another girl in six months since this happened. He will declare that he needs to start meeting women again, and hell go out once or twice (for 30 minutes before he drives back home), and then hell say he needs to focus on his career right now. &amp;nbsp; Recently he decided this dream girl of his fucked him up. He said what happened made him unable to meet women anymore, that hes scarred, and this is why he wont go out. &amp;nbsp; **The Downward Spiral** &amp;nbsp; From the outside looking in, his behavior is clearly neurotic. But to him, it all made logical sense. Thats the real problem, its so obvious how other people unnecessarily fuck themselves over, but we all have a bias to be blind to our own similar behavior. &amp;nbsp; Its easy to notice when someone else is falling into a neurotic, self-destructive pattern, but its incredibly difficult to admit this to yourself.Nicks mindset has a foundational issue thats preventing him from growing. He is dealing with his relationship problems using what psychologists call a static mindset. &amp;nbsp; A static mindset is a belief that people dont change, that we are the victim to external circumstances. A static mindset is a ruthless self-fulfilling prophecy. &amp;nbsp; For example, you can have a static belief that you arent intelligent. Maybe you didnt excel in school early on and the feedback you got made you believe that school just wasnt for you, you just arent smart enough. This calcifies into a static mindset that you are not smart, that you, as a person, arent able to be a good student. This mindset becomes self-reinforcing. &amp;nbsp; When you are assigned homework, you tell yourself that youre not a good student, so you avoid the homework or approach it halfheartedly. When you read for class you dont pay attention, because, whats the point? Youre not going to get anything out of it anyway, schools just a waste of time for a dumb kid. &amp;nbsp; Then the grades come in, your parents are disappointed, and the negative feedback is stressful. The easiest way to interpret this feedback is to blame your failure on something outside of your control. Something essential to who you are, like your lack of intelligence. &amp;nbsp; By doing this, you relieve yourself from the pain of knowing that your own decisions are causing you to fail. By doing this, its not your fault. Instead, its like a disease, something you dont have to blame yourself for, something that youre a victim to. &amp;nbsp; This is a negative self-belief that can only lead to negative feelings about yourself. Sure, you alleviate yourself from responsibility for your problems, but you accomplished this through negative self-evaluation. This frees you from one source of stress, and traps you in another, far more damning stress- the feeling of helplessness. You paralyze yourself and make action impossible, because your mindset says action is pointless, that youre not good enough, no matter what you do. &amp;nbsp; **Victims to Ourselves** &amp;nbsp; Nick believes that he doesnt deserve a healthy relationship based on mutual respect. So, he makes it impossible for himself to get in this kind of relationship. He avoids meeting women unless he gets wasted, and when he does meet a woman he really likes, he self-sabotages the relationship so that its doomed to end before it ever really begins. &amp;nbsp; He tells himself a story about why this is happening, a story about who he is- a person that is fundamentally damaged, wounded, a victim. And through making himself a victim, he entitles himself to continue acting in self-destructive ways, sabotaging his relationships with ridiculous decisions like inviting a second girl on a date with the girl he really likes. &amp;nbsp; And those self-destructive behaviors reinforce his static, negative self-beliefs. He must be damaged or he wouldnt keep acting in such self-harming ways. If he werent a victim, then why does he keep making the same mistakes without ever escaping the cycle? &amp;nbsp; Most people do this, the differentiator between those who change and those who dont is how effective you are at becoming aware of the damage youre doing to yourself. &amp;nbsp; Every time you catch yourself falling into a self-destructive social pattern, you are opening yourself up to change. This is the only way to make real, substantial growth. Ask yourself how you might be doing this to yourself right now. It may be mild, it may be extreme, but self-destructive patterns are there, no ones mindset is perfectly enlightened. We all have negative beliefs about ourselves. &amp;nbsp; The path towards deep confidence is a path of building awareness of the ways in which your mindset is damaging yourself, and then finally being free to let go of them and disprove them. &amp;nbsp; Dont think of your mindset as something you need to fix, in a paradoxical way, this gives that mindset more charge, more power. What you resist, persists. Actively fighting against a mindset is emotionally acknowledging that mindset as valid. Conscious rebellion doesnt work, the path towards true change is counter-intuitive, it is surrender. &amp;nbsp; By accepting you do have negative self-beliefs, by surrendering to the fact that these mindsets are affecting you, they lose their emotional power over you. This is the path to freeing yourself from your self-imposed limitations. &amp;nbsp; (Part three will dive into the specific how-to of becoming aware of your own negative self-beliefs and freeing yourself from the problems they create) &amp;nbsp; If you want to see part three when it's released, you can do so by subscribing to the newsletter at: URL"
80,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Rational Male  The Anger Bias,116,628x3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/628x3h/rational_male_the_anger_bias/,2017-03-30 06:38:17,"Essay: URL Excerpt: I would argue here that mens state in western(izing) cultures is one that grossly exaggerates mens overall potential for anger, and by extension violence. Presuming that Red Pill men are a bunch of angry misogynists is one such error, but it is also a useful one in that it plays upon this overestimation of anger in men on whole. This anger attribution in men will always be an easy method of poisoning the well or creating straw men arguments from which opponents of Red Pill awareness will dismiss valid, factual arguments. As you might guess, this male anger bias is a simple tool to use  and one I unfortunately see being employed by many Purple Pill dating coaches whod like to dissuade their clientele from the less marketable aspects of Red Pill awareness. Anything Red Pill that disagrees with their feminine-sanitized advice is conveniently dismissed as negative or the rantings of angry, bitter, burned men. It becomes Truthful Anger, but their emphasis is always on the anger part rather than the truth that would kick a leg out from under their positivity marketing scheme. The default state of women and feminized men is one of a presumed vulnerability due to a persistent social characterization of a default female victimhood in popular culture and media. Likewise, men are portrayed as quick to anger  all in spite of generations of effort spent in Blue Pill conditioning of men to be ideally passive, supportive, non-assertive and entirely less masculinized. Despite all that sensitivity conditioning, from the earliest ages, the default presumption thats still popularly reinforced is that men are always the angry/violent ones. Domestic violence laws presume a man is always the attacker and always the party to be removed from the home because of this preconception. Both the Feminine Imperative and even well meaning Red Pill men default to this overestimation. I get that this is largely merited on whole as a characteristic of men. This error management is a useful and pragmatic adaptation, but it is also a useful foil for dismissing men on whole. Its interesting that Id be pilloried for expressing that the realities of womens menstrual cycle predispose them to ovulatory shift, as well as anti-social, behaviors, yet were I to explain that testosterone predisposes men to aggression we largely accept this as a given. My intent in this essay isnt to say men arent as angry as their evolutionary nature makes them. The point is that a feminine-primary social order readily makes this nature a useful tool in dismissing what would otherwise be valid, but uncomfortable Red Pill truth. This anger bias mechanism is a tool for message control."
81,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Exit the Matrix: Recognizing the gynocentric narrative of the inferior male,25,62x4vf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/62x4vf/exit_the_matrix_recognizing_the_gynocentric/,2017-04-02 12:01:18,"&gt;**Morpheus:** Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something. What you know you can't explain, but you feel it. You've felt it your entire life, that there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is, but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. I don't know how each of you guys got here, but for me this little passage from *The Matrix* describes in a nutshell the nagging feeling at the back of my head I had ever since I was old enough to question what I was told when it came to men and women. I grew up in the 80s/90s in a leftist household, and was continuously exposed to the progressive narrative regarding gender of that time. Either directly through my social environment or indirectly through media. I was so thoroughly indoctrinated that I internalized it, yet simultaneously was forced into resorting to cognitive dissonance to reconcile the contradictory nature, both because the inherent logic of several related statement was mutually exclusive, and because they were hard to reconcile with my everyday experiences. I heard all the time about how boys and girls, men and women were totally and perfectly equal mentally, yet at the same time I was exposed to a constant barrage with how *better* women were across the board. When someone grudgingly admitted that men outperformed women in some regard, this was generally dismissed as the consequence of a male-centric education and preferential treatment (mind you, this was in the 90s, when [this](URL was already in full swing). I also heard the claim that *of course* no one said that women were morally superior to men, yet for some occult reason whenever gendered psychological profiles were pitted against one another, women were unanimously attributed positive traits (when negative traits were exposed, these were usually interpreted as the consequence of self-loathing due to the influence of the patriarchy - in other words: when me suck, it's men's fault, when women suck, it's also men's fault). The thing is: card-carrying bluepillers, so-called ""progressives"" (actually regressive leftists) are practically in love with the idea that they're oh-so-super egalitarian. That both genders are fundamentally equal in potential and should also enjoy equal treatment and representation, and that *they* are the ones who most thoroughly embrace and promote it. However, my position is that they not only tolerate or willfully blind out misandry while being overly sensitive when it comes to misogyny, no, they actually demonstrate susceptibility the same double standard while simultaneously masturbating over how enlightened they are (regardless of the fact that their positions are neither logical nor egalitarian). It usually looks like these examples: **1) People skills** There's a general consensus in society that women by and large are better in social settings than men. That they're more intuitive, have an easier time connecting with other people, are better at reading social cues, better at subtly influencing another person's opinion instead of using a brute force-approach (with ""brute force""-approach I don't mean using threats, but trying to dominate a debate by ""winning"" through better arguments instead of actually convincing the other party) etc. It *also* wouldn't really be controversial if I said that by and large, men are more susceptible to feminine wiles, female sexual signals etc. than vice versa. And finally, it also is *very* obvious that men are stronger than women and more prone to use physical force to solve their problems than women. Now what we have here is a list of traits that praise women on the one hand and deride men on the other. Most people wouldn't object that these statements generally apply. However (unless we assume that women are morally superior by default and flawlessly angelic people who would never prefer the easy way, which of course ""no true feminist"" would ever do - at least not explicitly) the logical consequence of this would be that women are better at manipulation and also more likely to employ manipulative tactics in their relationships and in everyday life. That they use displays of vulnerability, sexual signals etc. to goad men into doing their bidding, simply because they *can* (and men generally don't do it simply because they *can't*). That they're doing it because they're able to and because it's the easiest way for them to get what they want (certainly easier than threats or physical force)... in short, that they are *more manipulative than men*. However, unless you really want shit to hit the fan, you shouldn't say that. Why the different reactions? Simple: saying that women are more intuitive, have more fine-tuned social sensors etc. is a positive description. Casting them as better manipulators is a negative description, therefore misogyny, therefore it has to be wrong. **2) Being on the spectrum** This is tangentially related to the prior point: the higher propensity of males for social ineptitude which also materalizes in a higher propensity for being on the spectrum. Saying this - ""men are more likely to be on the spectrum"" won't be perceived as offensive, let alone factually incorrect. Saying that ""autism is the extreme male brain"" didn't summon shitstorms or cost Simon Cohen his job. While female autists or aspies exist, stating that men on average score higher on the autism quotient spectrum won't be met with opposition. Why? Well, it isn't a net positive that differentiates men from women, it's actually the opposite. Therefore ""progressives"" and card-carrying bluepillers can live with that. However, the other side of that particular coin is that [ranking higher on the the AQS correlates with better performances in STEM-related fields.](URL This means that even *if* we assume that otherwise the capacity for math is evenly distributed regardless of gender (I don't, but let's simply assume for the sake of the argument that it's the case), the fact alone that you have more men who rank higher on the ASQ should already raise some questions regarding the veracity of the statement that women and men perform equally here. But good luck trying to get a fervent bluepiller to admit (if only to himself) that the genders aren't perfectly equal and that women *don't* have exactly the same potential as men on average. Why? Because it *is* a net positive that differentiates men from women (a net positive that's actually the flip side of a net negative), and as a consequence bluepillers *can't* live with it. **3) Work** Or let's bring up something else: women and their relation to their work. On average, they prefer jobs with a communal/social focus, and value a healthy work/life-balance more than men. This is usually framed as women being more down-to-earth, having more reasonable preferences in life, being more social and giving than men etc. (that men choosing to pick better-paying fields and working overtime is also due to them having to build up SMV that way is another matter). However, not only the 77c/$-gap can be largely attributed to these priorities, there's also another imbalance that's affected by this: high status positions. For some reason, the leftist idea of a just and egalitarian society is that women *should* have a roughly 50% representation when it comes to CEOs, politicians etc. Mind you, I am not questioning that the glass ceiling exists (or has existed), but that the epitome of fairness, the much-praised parity, actually is *fair*. These high-status jobs usually have the unfortunate condition that you have to spend *an awful fucking lot of time working*. Like 80 hrs/week or even more - which means that ambitious people of both genders can kiss their work/life-balance goodbye, and since women are less likely to be willing to do this, the natural consequence is that you end up with more male applicants than female ones for these positions, plain and simple. This means that even if the potential is perfectly evenly distributed among said applicants and the selection process is absolutely fair and gender-blind, you'd *automatically* end up with more men in power than women, which is something the advocates of gender parity simply ignore. Fairness is 50:50 and anything else *must* be the patriachy at work. I don't know whether they do it because reality is too inconvenient for their narrative, or because they suck at basic logic, or both, but that's how it is. ----------- And so on. The thing is: in BP-land, some positions are ok to have, while others aren't. So it's totally PC to comment on male shortcomings. But the corresponding perks that come with it, which women don't have (since they also lack the shortcomings)? Can't exist, everything has to be a perfect 50:50 symmetry (unless the actual numbers would make women look good), and don't you dare even *thinking* anything else. In the same vein, it's equally PC to mention traits that illustrate how great women are, yet the same bloops who wouldn't hesitate a second to endorse statements like that go in full denial mode when the downsides of these traits are brought up. These of course can't be right. The reason for women performing worse, for women being underrepresented in some fields or position are as a rule extrinsic and never intrinsic. Feminists externalize the responsibility for female shortcomings but internalize the responsibility for their successes - even when both are two sides of the same coin. It doesn't matter whether something is true or false, whether it's logical and reasonable or outlandish and an asspull. What matters is whether it conforms to axiomatic progressive beliefs or not. They extensively pay lip-service to the idea of the genders being equal, but in reality they adhere to a very Orwellian interpretation of the term. This, dear sirs, is the gynocentric narrative of the inferior male: Both genders are equal, but one is more equal than the other. "
82,vulnerability,TheRedPill,An Attempt to Classify and Describe the Realms of Power: An Aid in Managing Your Quest for Power,16,5xnasf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/5xnasf/an_attempt_to_classify_and_describe_the_realms_of/,2017-03-06 02:33:25,"To score a hot woman. To have your dick pressed inside a wet and hot vagina and the sight of that naked womans body trembling in ecstasy. To feel the coldness of her legs pressed against the back of your thighs. To see and feel your cock pushed into her mouth with your hands strangling her hair as she struggles her best to satisfy your lust. To know that you have lost a girl. And not care. To see her with a new guy. And know that you are different now, so different and so distant that you cant even find it amusing. You just know that its him, and this is you, and shrug a quick breath, and perhaps laugh a little. Not because you are sour-graping, but because it is a tiny celebration after looking at your former weakness, of knowing that had you not grown, had you not pushed beyond your fears and laziness, you might have become a miserly fuck, and pussy out on knowing that youre not with some girl. To lean forward as you speak, surrounded by a group of fellow men who look you straight in the face, and listen to every word you quote with such fiery passion and zealous intent. The impact is twice as strong when you know very well that these men, are men of honor, of courage, and in the possession of both the refined capability and brutish strength and experience. Such physical strength and mental fortitude that you know can wreck the bones and scare the nerves of lesser men, who have come to think that they are strong, not because they saw death straight in the face, but because the walls of safety brought them away from the grim reality of losing limbs. Because the lesser men have been surrounded by timid humans and so forget that there exists men who, when offered a handshake will just stare you blankly in the eye and ask, Who the fuck are you? To know that in a den of monsters with balls of steel, you are the alpha dog. To have your mind run with laser-point focus. To have your heart beat for only one purpose. To work in a place surrounded by noise and vanity, and to know that none of their bullshit matters. To realize down to the final core of your nerves, to the last fiber of your muscles, to the last marrow of your bones, that your strength today is not your strength of old  you have become more powerful, more capable, leaner and stronger that you have ever imagined. To know that you are not yet at your final form, to face the fact that you are still striving, to recognize that you are not there yet, that you are not satisfied, and tell the world that youll walk that road that leads beyond. To fuck. To command. To lead. To destroy. To win. To build. To grow. To expand. To lose and stand back up and walk with conviction. The feeling is essentially identical. The drive to power manifests itself in more than just one form. The many forms of power can be divided into three categories: **interpersonal**, **environmental**, and **personal**. The interpersonal category can be subdivided further into four forms: *sexual*, *social-hierarchical*, *conflictive*, and *neutral-interpersonal*. The most known and most sough-after form of power in this sub is **sexual power**. It is to know that one is worshipped by ones object of desire. To narrow down the discussion, this form of power will only be examined from the masculine perspective, for now. However, it is still not as simple as just putting your dick inside a chick and you start feeling powerful. Although that is probably one of its ultimate forms. The mere fact of knowing a woman is looking at you with animalistic stares. Or of knowing that a woman can never get over your premium dick, is also a form of sexual power. Another is **social-hierarchical**. In a league, to know that one stands higher than another human being in a social hierarchy gives a definitive feeling of empowerment. Whoever calls the shots in the social hierarchy gets the feeling of power. There is also the **conflictive** form of power. Like the social-hierarchical power and the sexual power, this form of power is also in regard to how humans relate to one another. To differentiate the social-hierarchical to conflictive power, the former exists between humans who are in harmony with one another both in action and intention. As for the latter, it is necessary that there exists a conflict or opposition between the human beings involved. The conflict or opposition can be classified as confrontational or comparative, primarily-physical or primarily-mental, and violent or non-violent. To discuss further, both warfare and boxing are forms of confrontational, violent, and primarily physical conflict. On the other hand, the Space Race and a simple quiz bee among kids is a form of comparative, primarily-mental, and non-violent form of conflict. Whoever wins in this form of conflict will get the feeling of empowerment. The first three discussed all involves relationships between two or more humans, and here goes the fourth and final one: We should call it the **neutral-interpersonal**. This is your relationship with the barista as you enter the coffee store, or your relationship the entire crowd that dines there, your relationship with the people in social media, or you and the people in a seminar. In all four realms of this interpersonal power, a degree of one-upmanship, or alphaness can be achieved in varying degrees. The most obvious example in the sexual realm is if the man chases too far, he becomes the beta in the sexual form of power. In a the social-hierarchical arena, the business owner holds the presumptive alpha position, unless he has been hiring someone to make money for him and all he does is nod and nod with his tail between his legs. In the conflictive form, whoever bests the competitor takes the upper plane of the realm. And in a neutral-interpersonal  a realm where interactions can be so subtle  the one who gives less shit and focuses very hard on his activity, and have the by-sitters become curious and jealous of his activity, takes the upper hand. We now move to the **environmental** realm of power. This one is the simplest to explain, since the absence of humans in this realm, simplifies things. Notice how the absence of humans can simplify a individual humans life. After all, unlike humans, nature, including animals, doesnt have the complex yet imperfect reading/mirror neurons/theory of mind, that humans possess. I suspect that this complexity and imperfection is the cause of many complications in human interactions. The environmental realm is where man seeks to conquer or control the non-living. This may include physical endeavours such as forest survival camps, kayaking, lifting, painting, making music, reading, shooting, understanding of the science, technology, etc. Anything that involves a man and a non-living conquest is a power struggle in the environmental realm. We know this commonly as craftsmanship, art, or work. And in order to gain great power over ones environment, a big chunk of it relies on the character traits of the man practicing his craft, such as diligence, work ethic, etc., and this leads to the realm of power that is always present in all realms of power  the power of man over himself. For this discussion, we shall call this **personal power**. At first glance, one might think that it is but ones personality, but if one thinks about it, personality is nothing but a study of how one thinks or feels, such as irritability or vulnerability to stress. It is also more than just ones state of mind, for a state of mind is but a result of multiple factors both external events and internal happenings, such as fatigue, lack of sleep, and neurochemical or hormonal balance. It also deals how a man struggles *despite* himself. Like in war, knowing at which terrain certain battles will take place is a key factor, so that an armed force can figure out what weapons to use and what strategies will apply and increase, or even ensure, that it will engage in battles that can advance the goal of winning the war. Similarly, defining the realms at which power struggles can take place is one factor needed to know in order for man to fulfil his quest for power. One may then proceed to figure out how his power struggles should be managed, which I will attempt to provide a few methods and maneuvers at a later date."
83,vulnerability,TheRedPill,"Men speak the language of facts. Women speak the language of emotion. In order to retain her attention, you're gonna have to speak the language of emotion... and 9 more lessons extracted from tonight's night out.",322,5yxg5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/5yxg5b/men_speak_the_language_of_facts_women_speak_the/,2017-03-12 17:30:02,"I went out tonight solo and approached numerous sets. Here's 10 lessons I extracted: 1. She's at the bar to have fun, not to get to know you. Therefore, if you want to retain her attention you have to spike her emotions. This is done through controversial statements, compliments, polarizing thoughts, cold reads, unabashed honesty, vulnerability, innuendos, and more. When you're there talking to her, throw out the window that you need to build rapport. The facts, like what she does for a living, where she lives, and so on, are irrelevant. You're there to make an impression on her, and your window of opportunity is short and dwindling every second her attention is focused on you and not on dancing or bullshitting with her friends. 2. Enter each conversation not just with zero expectations, but with the expectation that you will never see them again and you are there just to enjoy yourself. Throughout the night, I spoke with married women, women with their boyfriends there, women claiming to have boyfriends when I attempted to close, women with groups of friends who lost interest in me, and women who failed to appreciate me or contribute any significance to the conversation. In all of these cases I had a Win, because I framed it as enjoyment and experience talking to women. 3. It's a law of nature that women never go out alone. They go in pairs, in groups, or in mixed sets. But this doesn't matter. If you're hitting it well with a woman, it will be obvious to the group, and they will help you out by letting you be or encouraging the interaction. So you should never be afraid of approaching a woman who is not alone. 4. Be patient. Slow down. If you see a potential woman to speak to, relax and take your time. Don't rush up to her as if there is some time limit to when you can approach. Take everything in stride. People around you are cognizant of you and their surrounding. Women feel if you are too excited and rushed. Instead, take a breath, get a look at your surroundings, and casually go in for the approach with confidence in your stride. 5. Make your intentions clear throughout the conversation. Pepper into the conversation hints that you are there because you want to bang her. This way, when you go in for physical escalation or number close, she won't retaliate in shock and surprise because she thought you were just having a regular platonic conversation. 6. Fact: Men are creepy. Fact: Women live in fear. When you perceive the world with these facts in mind, you come to empathize that not all woman want your D. Your approach exudes empathy with their predicament as women without pedestalizing them. 7. American women are at the bar to have a good time. They will avoid social embarrassment, harshness/rudeness, and any negative emotions when rejecting you. Their rejections will be soft, ignorant, polite, or just simply non existent like walking away. Their body language will face away from you and they will avoid eye contact, giving you subtle hints like these that they want you to go away, saying things like ""It was nice meeting you"" or ""I've got to get back to my friend"" or ""I'm going to go get a drink"" etc. Unlike European women, they will not yell, get mad/frustrated, or overtly tell you to piss off. Therefore, if you feel a situation is going south, better to bounce and start fresh with a new woman. 8. Don't waste your time on women you aren't genuinely interested in. Tonight I had a few sets where I realized: what the hell am I doing, I'm not even attracted to her. Personally, I'm against the dogma to ""talk to everyone"". It's wasteful, tiresome, and stupid. Focus. Focus your time and your efforts on the women that have some potential. 9. It's ridiculous the stuff you can and will get away with saying to a woman as long as you have confidence and congruent body language. Take away that filter, go all out, and remember that none of it matters because if she doesn't like it you can always walk away. 10. I cannot name a single professional pua that drinks when he goes out. When I go out, I order water. And that's fine. Even if they mock me for drinking water, I hold my frame. Conclusion: Friday and Saturday nights, go out and talk to women. Go alone if need be. Develop strong temporary connections. Hopefully the 10 lessons above will help you out. And be sure to write some field reports, there's a reason why that tag exists on TRP."
84,vulnerability,TheRedPill,A post with quite a lot you should know about seduction,295,5kk3ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/5kk3ik/a_post_with_quite_a_lot_you_should_know_about/,2016-12-28 02:01:45,"**PARADIGMS** 1. PARADIGM 1: WOMEN WANT SEX. Fact: women enjoy sex. They love it. They will go to lengths to get it. Therefore, it is ok to talk sexual with her. Arouse her, get her blood level rising. And ultimately, the two of you will have sex. 2. PARADIGM 2: SEX WILL HAPPEN. Sex is as likely as the chances of her showing up to the date in the beginning. Accept this as a fact, and the flow of the date leads you two fucking. Be confident in your abilities and accept that sex between the two is as likely as the sun rising in the morning. 3. PARADIGM 3: YOU ARE THE CATCH. YOU ARE THE PRIZE. She is there to win your attention. You know you have fully embraced this paradigm when she doesnt impress you so you politely leave. Which brings me to the next paradigm. 4. PARADIGM 4: HAVE THE ABILITY TO WALK AWAY. Dating and negotiation are twins in this world, principles that apply to one often apply to the other. Consider the following scenario: your boss tells you you cannot leave the negotiating room without a deal. If the opposing party discovers this, youre fucked. They will put you through the wringer, get everything they want, and leave you with parcels. It is your ability to walk away at any moment that gives you strength, makes the other party chase you, and allows you to reap the benefits. The same goes with dating. You show her that you are not reliant on her and she will come to you if she likes you and is worth it. 5. PARADIGM 5: VIEW HER FOR WHO SHE IS, NOT FOR THE SEX YOU WANT. This is similar to the previous paradigm. If you dont like her as a person and as a human being, just move on. Dont just stick it through for the sex. The sex probably wont happen with someone like that, and even if it does it probably wont be that good. 6. PARADIGM 6: REALITY IS FLUID. IT IS A CONCEPT BASED ON THE SENSES AND INPUTS THE MIND RECEIVES. If you believe it is possible, you can use this belief to shape your reality. Make the impossible possible. And sex is simply a construct of the reality you choose to perceive. Perceive that sex is yours, and it will happen. Have proper planning, adequate confidence, good body language, and sex is pretty much guaranteed. 7. PARADIGM 7: If you have not control over it, don't waste time worrying about it. I've had girls text me the next day saying that they didn't feel a connection. I felt fine about this because at this point, I have no influence over how they feel. It would be a stressful waste of time to worry about something like this. When something unfortunate happens and you have no ability to alter the outcome, the best thing you can do is move on. 8. PARADIGM 8: You know you've made it as a somebody if you have enemies. So go out there and make enemies. Too many people avoid conflict at all costs, willing to swallow a loss in order not to hurt any feelings. If you go through life trying to appease everyone, you're going to be disrespected and thrown to the side. Ruffling feathers isn't a bad thing, especially when the person deserves it. Stand up for yourself, fight for your rights, and be willing to lose people on your life journey toward success. 9. PARADIGM 9: Treat the date like a game of chess, not like a game of Jenga. Most of us have the false notion of going into a date trying to say the perfect line every time, never make a mistake, and be sure to have positive feelings throughout. We treat the date like it's a game of Jenga: one slip up and everything collapses. This is false. In fact a date is more similar to chess. It is a game of strategy, confidence, and strength. Any slip up can be compensated with boldness, in fact turning the potential weakness into an asset. 10. PARADIGM 10: If you want her to like you, you have to like yourself first. Do this right now: take a piece of paper and write 10 qualities about yourself that make you a prize. Then write 10 accomplishments you've achieved. This positive reinforcement will enable you to talk to her with the necessary confidence to seduce her. 11. PARADIGM 11: Your highs better not be that high, your lows better not be that low. I call this the Bond Mentality (written in a previous post as The 007 Mentality). If you notice James Bond, or Agent 007, never smiles. He never laughs and never cries. No matter what the mission throws at him, he takes it all in stride, with a razor sharp focus on completion. Similarly, you should learn to develop the habit of not celebrating with every minor victory as well as not get disheartened with every minor setback. Your base is 0. Something good happens, you feel +1. Something bad happens you, you feel -1. But you always revert back to your equilibrium base of 0. Mood swings are dangerous and emotionally tolling. 12. ITS MORE THAN LOGISTICS. ITS ABOUT GEOGRAPHY. Everything should be walking distance. The place you her will be walking distance to the bar which will be walking distance to the park which will be walking distance to your apartment. Whatever you do, it is critical that your lay location is walking distance from at least where you meet her. The probability of you bringing her home drops precipitously if you have to drive or take public transportation. While its not impossible, its an unnecessary hurdle to overcome. IMPORTANT NOTE: ALWAYS SIT AT A BAR 90 DEGREES FROM HER. NEVER SIT AT A TABLE. THIS IS FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: 1. I can put my arm around her at the bar 2. I can kiss her neck 3. I can kiss her mouth 4. I can finger her 5. I can hold her hand 6. I can get close to her. YOU CANT DO SHIT SITTING ACROSS FROM EACH OTHER AT A TABLE. **CONVERSATION NOTES:** 1. Have prepared stories. Stories build both comfort and value. 2. Avoid interview mode. Dont pummel her with questions. 3. Talk. Slowly. Talk. Just. Like. You. Are. Reading. This. Sentence. 4. Take pauses in your speech. 5. Build tension. Embrace conflict. If she says something wrong call her out on her shit. Do it. Dont be a puppy dog. 6. Ask questions you care to know the answer for. Body language and tonality are everything. If you are asking questions to fill time she will figure that out and the date will go flat. 7. Talk about her passions. Uncover what makes her tick. 8. Be able to ramble. While deliberate pauses are encouraged, a lack of being able to say something can be perceived as a lack of attraction and you do not want this. 9. Most of communication is body language. Without delving into the complexities of body language, just make sure you have open body language and position her body to have open body language. **CONFIDENCE** 1. Confidence is fundamental and confidence starts with the fundamentals. Exercise, good grades, a steady job, adequate sleep, a social circle, these are all just basic. If you are shaky in any of these areas it will affect your confidence and that just may ruin you. 2. Two steps forward one step back. I have never had a date end because I tried to go to far. I have left dates with regret that I didnt go too far. So push the limits. Go for the handhold. Go for the kiss. Go for the fuck. If she politely declines, politely move back and work your way back up again. 3. Confidence comes from preparation. Prepare for your date. A date is not improv, and youre not some improv king. Be serious, write out what you plan to talk about, where you plan to go, and how everything should go overall. **RANDOM NOTES** 1. Always be prepared to pay for the date. If this bothers you let it go. 2. CALL HER OUT. CALL HER SHIT. CALL HER NAMES (good and funny). TEASE HER. FUCKING MAKE HER WORK FOR YOUR APPRECIATION. You are not a charity, people need to deserve your respect. Push-pull. We appreciate what we work for. **FRAME** 1. On a date, the girl has entered my frame. I am the one who maintains the tempo of the conversation, the venue changes, who escalates, and who dictates the general terms of the interaction. Girls love this. They love being led. I am doing the work, but at the end it is well worth it. 2. Unless I murder someone, I never ever apologize. Never. If I say something wrong I can rephrase it, change the subject, or make a joke out of it. Apologies are weakness, not vulnerability. They also just put a damper on the whole situation. 3. A girl has to appeal to me. Even with regard to having sex, she has to earn it. We appreciate what we have to work for, and we are almost always disgusted by what comes to us for free. So make her work for it. **PUSH-PULL** 1. Heres a metaphor: a roller coaster. What makes it so thrilling is that it goes up AND down. If it just went up or just went down, itd get boring fast. Similarly, if your interaction is only positive reinforcement you are doing it wrong. You need to give her an experience she will remember, and this means taking her on an emotional roller coaster. Ecstatic highs, equally important lows. 2. Highs: These are easy. These include compliments, flattery, and physical escalation. 3. Lows: These are EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT. These include negs, pullbacks, and insults said in a sympathetic way. **ABUNDANCE** 1. When she texts you, take a breath before responding. Make her anticipate that you have a life, and a good one. One where she is important, but not what your life revolves around. 2. Abundance isnt just about what you have at this exact moment, its also about what you will have in the future. Your potential. So if you have few women in your life right now, but you work out, read, and better yourself daily, your potential is high, and therefore treat yourself with the abundance you will soon have. 3. Thirst and desperation is one of the most unattractive traits out there. Avoid it at all costs. And remember: There are 3 billion more women out there man. Go out and conquer. **RAGE AND SERENITY** 1. In the movie X-Men: First Class, Professor X tells Magneto that true focus lies at the point between rage and serenity. Once Magneto realizes this, he is able to accomplish unbelievable feats with his power, including lifting a giant submarine in the air. This concept of Professor X's can also be applied to seduction. Within us there are belief systems built upon the emotions of pain, anger, and sorrow. These need to be balanced with memories of experiences of joy, faith, and love. Together, these forces harness a powerful energy that enables you to become charismatic. And people gravitate toward the charismatic. 2. At first glance, emotions like anger and rage can be seen as bad or detrimental. However I think that they are very much useful and even necessary emotions. Rage and anger can abruptly light a fire that burns inside of you, causing you to want to take action. However if you let this flame get out of control, then you will have thrown logic out the window and will be operating solely on emotion. This is where serenity and peace come in. They calm that fire to something more like the burning of coal. **CONCLUDING THOUGHTS** 1. It is not our thoughts, it is our actions that are all that matter in this world. Action, decision, implementation are what people remember. It is those who go out there and make it a difference in their lives and in the world are who are remembered. So go, get out there a seize what you deserve. 2. If we can land a man on the moon, you can stick your dick in someones vagina. It's possible. And more probable than you expect. 3. TAKE RISKS. TEST THE LIMITS. The majority of limitations are in our mind and are in fact nonexistent in the real world."
85,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Intense Rapport Building In Disadvantaged Situations: An Examination,127,5lp2jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/5lp2jf/intense_rapport_building_in_disadvantaged/,2017-01-03 12:36:42,"TRP, this is a long one. I could have cropped the examples, but I wanted to provide reference materials for ways I've practically applied this knowledge and I feel it's relevant to the discourse. Mods, if there is a more efficient way to present this info, it's poorly applied to Red Pill philosophy or the signal-to-noise ratio needs adjustment relative to the discourse generated, please advise and I will make alterations. Thank you. **Intro:** I have identified a trend in the way I qualify, escalate with, and build intense and lasting rapport with women that has led to an almost-zero flake rate over many attempts, in situations where building rapport may be harder than normal (online dates, text game, number-closes that took place too rapidly for proper comfort and rapport phases). In this post, I will break down specific tactics used to generate rapport, explain their utility and importance in creating intense feelings of connection in short amounts of time, and demonstrate how they can be used in regular in-person dates as well as over text to establish dominant frame early, display amused mastery, and to reduce flake chances, contrary to the current texting attitude of Only text to make plans. **Body:** Turning harmless flirtation into a solid commitment that leads to a date that leads to sex *from an online or poor quality in person lead with high success rates* is something many guys find difficult. The following is an exploration of an escalation ladder I employ before and during every date that strikes the right balance of sex/comfort for my own goals. (plates/mLTRs with a low to moderate emotional investment level.) **The Goal:** Our objective is to rapidly create intense feelings of connection, understanding, and us-versus-them mentality between you and your girl. They are one method of creating a sense of passionate abandon where your woman loses herself in the emotions and positive feelings you are communicating to her, by *addressing her using her feels instead of her reals,* to vastly reduce or eliminate the barriers in public physical escalation, taking her home, and leading to sex. The four I have identified as consistent throughout my use of game are as follows: **Nickname-Emotion Callback** **Object Anchoring** **Evasive Responses** **Conversational Burden Flip** **How can I generate intense feelings of connection in short amounts of time?** Here, I will break down each individual technique, and elaborate using a real-world example of my application. **1. Nickname-Emotion Callback** Early on in my interactions with a woman, usually between getting the number and setting the date, Ill need to do some rapport building, as I am in one of the disadvantaged situations mentioned above and have built little to no comfort or vulnerability. In these situations, I will identify a quality about the woman that pleases me and is easily visible (most frequently, curiosity, as I make a habit of responding elusively or alluding to greater truths in my responses to her questions), and then associate that quality with an endearing pet name. Ill bring it up as an aside in conversation, usually accompanied by a subtle disqualifier or rapport break, and then work it into conversation as it goes on. The aim in doing so is to reward her for displaying such a quality, paint her as the aggressor in the seduction, and associate it with positive feelings of reward and feminine desirability that are then at your disposal to call back whenever you choose to reward her by using this pet name. **The Example** Her: So what do you do? Me: I pick up rich women and swindle them out of their inheritances. Her: No, I mean like a job. Me: So curious. Do you pry this much into every new guy you meet? Im changing your name in my phone to Kitten. Her: Im not a kitten! I cant know what you do? Me: What if you picked me up and swindled me out of my inheritance? You cant be too safe, kitten. **Key takeaways:** After continuous association, I begin to refer to her by this nickname frequently, and shell often pet-name me as well. Im not opposed to standing out even further from every other guy in her phone. Notice the sort-of DHV (implying I have an inheritance), the deflection of the gold-digger test (with humor and poise, and a callback to a joke I just made), and the fact that I revealed nothing but still generated positive and lasting rapport. **2. Object Anchoring** I dont have any ketchup packets, but what I do have are opportunities to associate positive feelings and new and happy experiences with me with physical items. These items can later be used to call back those feelings and create a bond that runs deeper than just a brief physical interaction. I prefer items that are disposable but wont be thrown out or lose value for being commonplace. This creates an association with an item that is carried back into her life and becomes a part of her world, reminding her of you even when you are not present and serving to keep you on her mind and increase her subconscious investment in you. **The Example** Its a first date. Ive pulled her back to mine for the purposes of having a glass of champagne. I grab the bottle, wrap my arms around her back. Okay. Grab the bottle with one hand. Undo the wire tie. Grab the cork, and wiggle the bottle back and forth. Thats it. Shes squealing, anxious, Is it going to fly off? What do I do? I say, Settle down. Youre fine. Its about to pop. Are you ready? She squeals No!, jumps half a foot in the air as the cork pops off with a bang, and barely rights the bottle before our sparkling wine starts evacuating. I go into the room where it landed, grab it, and bring it back to her. Place it in her palm, wrap her fingers around it, and look her right in the eyes. Extremely firmly and sincerely, I said I want you to take this home with you. Put it on a shelf where you can see it, so that itll remind you of tonight. Its our first memory. Its important. **Key takeaways:** It doesnt matter if she puts it on her shelf or not. To my knowledge, this girl still carries it around religiously, but she could be lying or not, and it wouldnt matter. What does matter is that in the moment, her feelings of excitement and nervous energy are all validated, intensified, and we share a connected moment right before Im about to escalate for the lay. This is a huge boost in rapport, and even though its arguably very short term as theres no guarantee shell keep the item, I had the boost of comfort when I needed it. Go and do likewise. **3. Evasive Responses** In seduction, a crucial aspect of escalation is in making her chase you. This is usually done by framing her as the aggressor, and implying in further communications that youre reading into them as her chasing you. Another method of creating this chase is by responding evasively or with half-answers to her questions, giving her just enough to want to keep digging, which you then tease her for. As mentioned in many seduction materials, full straight answers are the death of a womans interest. **The Example** Her: So what do you do? Me: Im an underwear model, but I sell drugs on the side. Her: Haha yeah? What kind of drugs? Me: Viagra. My biggest clientele is aging men. Her: Oh yeah? Are you getting rich off of selling Viagra to elderly men? Me: They usually pop their boners just seeing me model underwear. The Viagra is just in case. Her: So youre sleeping with elderly men? Me: God, no. Gross. Im not a stripper anymore. Her: Anymore? Me: Those were darker days. Dont tell me youve never stripped before. Her: I cant say that I have. Me: Thats a shame. Canadian strip clubs are so much fun. Instead of dollar bills, they throw loonies at you. Her: *bursts out laughing* Me: *pinging noises* **Key Takeaways:** Responding elusively to inquiries gives you an opportunity to create inside jokes, long-running ones that can be stretched for joke ammo down the road. In addition, you inspire a much more invested response, one that can stretch on significantly, until shes texting you all night. Its on you to put an end to things, tell her you have shit to do, or stop responding and pick it up later to show non-neediness, as you cant just text her all night and make it clear youre low value, but the concept of shutting down conversations or ignoring texts for days are most useful when you dont have anything useful to say and you dont want to spam her with meaningless bullshit just to indulge your loneliness. Creating threads like this gives you so many ins and generates a lot of comfort with you, even though you told her nothing and revealed nothing, she gets to ""know you better."" **Conversational Burden Flip** When I want to get to the core of what a girl is about, I make statements of interest that demand a response, rather than asking questions like an interview. A small piece of information can become a big one, you can set a dominant frame, and by phrasing the right way and digging properly, shes spilling out her soul to you in a way she never expected to. Delivered with the right amount of assertiveness, she will find herself wondering why shes standing there complying with your every word, and shell be afraid of the massive rapport break it would take to knock you out of your pursuit. **The Example** Me: You look pretty in that scarf. I didnt know I was in the presence of a fashionista. Her: Its just a scarf. I dont wear it that often. Me: Yeah, you struck me as the wifebeater and trackpants kind of girl. Her: Yeah, totally. Thats pretty much all I do, with Netflix all day. Me: **Tell me more about what you get up to.** It cant all be Netflix. Her: Well, I volunteer at a soup kitchen on the weekends. Me: **Tell me more about that.** Her: Well, ever since I was little, I wanted to help out the less fortunate, and when I heard there was an opening I just kind of went for it! Me: So youve been a selfless girl ever since you were a kid. **Tell me more about that.** Her: Actually, as a kid I was pretty jealous. I used to steal my brothers toys and hide them when he wouldnt play with me. Me: Total oldest child syndrome. Her: Actually, Im the youngest, of four. My brother[blah blah blah] **Key Takeaways:** Tell me more about that is the strongest phrase you will use when it comes to digging deep for values and rapport. Its an inherent compliance test, and the only way for her to exit this feedback loop of vulnerability is with a No, a massive rapport break, as anything else can be flipped right back into getting her to make herself vulnerable. This is my personal method for developing quick and intense rapport. It works equally well over text and in person and leads to long, involved, vulnerable interactions that reduce flake rates, inspire great comfort, and make your life a hell of a lot easier. It incorporates elements of NLP (neuro-linguistic programming), script-flipped seduction, and sets your frame early, which means youre coming into the interaction with a pre-set frame to maintain instead of having to demonstrate one early on or risk slipping up. These fundamentals, while not groundbreakingly novel, work very well in reducing flakiness and generating rapid, intense rapport, over text or in person. **Tl;dr: ** Give her a pet name related to a cute thing she does that you want to remind her of, and use it to call back that feeling. Give her a disposable object thats meaningful in the context of your activity and store her positivity/nervous energy into the memory its associated with. Respond elusively and deflect direct questions while asking many of your own, to make her so curious she needs to show up and prove herself while setting a dominant frame, forcing her to qualify, and learning enough about her to screen for her family life, values, and red flags relating to her suitability as a plate and compatibility with you. Put the burden of the conversation on her instead of you with a Tell me more about that loop that will enable you to manage text conversations with ease, delve deeper into her psyche, and create a familiar sense of compliance within her to your commands, which will vastly reduce flakes, induce comfort, and minimize or eliminate obstacles related to the comfort phase of escalation.

86,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Reality cracking - cracks let the light in,3,5d65rs,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/5d65rs/reality_cracking_cracks_let_the_light_in/,2016-11-16 11:24:54,"**TLDR** The election of Trump overshadowed the death of Leonard Cohen. Leonard Cohen's song Anthem was the unofficial anthem of Fravia's site which dealt with reverse engineering including what he referred to as reality cracking. Even though Fravia passed away, his ideas still live on in places like the red pill. **Source** [Reality cracking - cracks let the light in](URL **Cut and Paste** Trump getting elected overshadowed the death of [Leonard Cohen](URL but the two are related. I first discovered [Leonard Cohen](URL back in 1995 when I stumbled across a website run by +Fravia. The site would change my perception of reality along with many others. The original site contained a series of cracking tutorials written by +ORC, with new tutorials being intermittently released. Cracking is the term used by software reverse engineers who remove copy protection from software. +ORC's tutorials differed from others in that they contained two parts. The first part was technical information on removing software protection; the second part was about something called **reality cracking** which is similar to **social engineering**. ## What is cracking? The term cracking on +Fravia's site referred to modifying software programs where the source code was missing. Usually, the purpose of cracking is to remove copy protection, to add functionality to the program or to modify the program to be used for something else besides its intended purpose. For reality cracking, it meant examining things which we experience in life. For example studying how things are laid out in a supermarket to influence people's buying decisions. When you enter a supermarket, you usually go past fresh fruits and vegetables; this encourages you to buy more. By checkouts, there are impulse items like gum or candy and magazines. People at the checkout are waiting, they will read a magazine, and then when they reach the cashier have a tendency to buy the magazine. The purpose of reality cracking is to make one more aware of outside influences. ## How do you crack? +Orc's cracking tutorials differed in that they attempted to explain the mindset behind cracking. By contrast, other cracking tutorials were similar to recipes, they described the tools used and then gave a mechanical process of locating where to modify the software. Once you had discovered where to change the software, you used a hex editor to apply the crack. In those days it was common to release cracks as a text file which contained a description on where to patch the software with your hex editor. +Orc, by contrast, tried to describe the mindset behind cracking. How to look at things differently. How to examine the flow of the program to determine where to apply the crack. The crack is something which modifies this flow. Ideally, the crack should be as small as possible to minimize undesired side effects. Software cracking is related to reality cracking or social engineering, in that we are using something in a manner in which it was not originally designed for. Reality cracking means being able to see the world with a minimum of influences. The outside forces can not be seen until you start looking at things from different perspectives. A way to do this is to ask questions. To determine if supermarkets are laid out to increase consumer spending one could ask. * Is there a common pattern to all supermarkets? * Do you appear to be channeled past certain items? * What happens if you break this pattern? * Are there actual rules which state you have to follow these patterns? With reality cracking, never assume, always test if possible. The ultimate purpose of reality cracking is to immunize yourself from outside influences and to discover unique ways to use things. ## Why crackers are hated and feared? People in dislike changes in the status quo, even if it has the potential to improve their lives. Chaos or uncertainty means risk; people are risk adverse. With elites, change in the status quo means they are in danger. New technology or ideas cause chaos which threatens the elites positions. +Fravia's site suffered heavily from denial of service attacks. Meanwhile, child pornography sites, which were relatively open on the internet at the time, went unscathed. +Fravia, being European had mainly a European following. Within a few years, some countries in Europe passed laws making software reverse engineering illegal and possibly the possession of tools used for software reverse engineering illegal also. The book [Free:the future of a radical profit](URL shows that piracy of music or software does not affect sales providing distributors are willing to adapt to new markets, in fact, it probably increases sales. Eventually, because of legal pressure, +Fravia closed his software reverse engineering site and reopened one called searchlores. The new site still dealt with reality cracking but was oriented towards finding information on the Internet. ## Cracks are what let the light in &gt; There is a crack, a crack in everything &gt; That's how the light gets in. &gt; [Anthem](URL [Leonard Cohen](URL [Leonard Cohen](URL song [Anthem](URL was the unofficial anthem of Fravia's sites because it talks about cracks. *There is a crack, a crack in everything* means that everything has a flaw. Cracks or flaws are usually seen as something negative, but it is a matter of perspective. As the song says *That's how the light gets in*. A reality cracker or a social engineer seeks these cracks or flaws, to seek the light. For me the song describes the prison we are in but the prison walls are cracked, these are what let the light in. Light symbolizes truth or knowledge which can be used to break out of this prison. When one crack is closed, another is opened. With software, a similar analogy exists, a patch which closes a vulnerability will often create new ones. +Fravia passed away in 2009, and recently [Leonard Cohen](URL passed away. With the passing of +Fravia, his site died, and at the time it appeared as if many of his ideas also passed away. ## Constant death, constant rebirth The goal of +Fravia as to provide people with tools to crack reality. His vision was Internet Communities where people could share knowledge without outside influences. The value of this experience would be evaluated solely by its worth. Fravia's major problem is at the time few people used the Internet, and social media was in its infancy. The recent elections of President Trump and President Duterte are fruits of his vision and others with similar ideas. In both cases, mainstream media supported mainstream politicians. And in both cases social and alternative media played a significant role in getting them elected. Mainstream media no longer has a monopoly on the truth. This does not mean one should sit back and relax for the next four or six years respectively. As I showed in a previous post [The ancient magical kingdom is a dangerous myth. Things are actually getting better - the bluepill wants you to think otherwise](URL most of the reforms in China are the result of social media. Increased knowledge means people can make better decisions. As the [The Dictators Handbook - a modern Machiavelli's version of ""The Prince""](URL all governments are totalitarian but within the framework if people are better informed they can make better decisions. If you want to start cracking reality, [Robert Anton Wilson](URL book [Prometheus Rising](URL provides different ways of looking at things. You are going say; Mr. Wilson was an occultism kook. I will agree, but if one strips away the occultism mumbo jumbo, they can get a different perspective on things. +Fravia,+Orc and [Leonard Cohen](URL where kooks also.

87,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Why should male worth depend on the irrational preferences of women?,63,54umqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/54umqd/why_should_male_worth_depend_on_the_irrational/,2016-09-28 14:07:33,"Ever wonder if there's something more to life than eating, fucking, and conforming to female sexual preferences? By over-buying into the concept of the traditional alpha, red pill men are selling themselves short, if not wholly contradicting themselves. The salient contradiction that red pills frequently make is when they believe that it's necessary to be validated by women, in order to be an ""alpha."" Have I got your attention? Good. ###INTRO In biology, an alpha is a leader and a beta is someone that follows and obeys the alpha. Today, these terms are incorrectly used to describe an alpha as a leader with evolutionary fitness (sexual desirability), and a beta as an undesirable (with low sexual fitness). Already, it is apparent that the terms are irrelevant. Being a person that strives to be like an alpha, technically makes one a beta. What truly makes these terms trivial, however, isnt their misuse, but the fact that they move men to valuate themselves and each other based on the preferences of women. ###EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS In Paleolithic/Neolithic times, men filled the role of killing the animals that women couldnt, members of threatening tribes, and so forth. As hunters, men evolved certain aptitudes that women manipulated for power. For instance, as an exceptional hunter, an alpha male tactfully killed animals, other men respected him, and they formed cooperative hunting groups together. Women were attracted to these leaders because controlling the head hunter meant having resources, the respect of his comrades and other women, prestige in the village, the opportunity to determine his heir, and so forth. Readers are likely familiar with most of this. But the real reason for why it is toxic for men to over-value the sexual selection of women has to do with how women and men interact with one another and resolve conflict. In forming groups, men validated each other by ability. Alphas were selected by beta males to be leaders. For a slightly more modern example, Roman generals were alphas only when they had the loyalty of their soldiers (betas). Sometimes this bond was stronger than allegiance to Rome itself. But for women, alpha-beta hierarchies are entirely different. Women form relationships by aggressively idolizing and judging each other as competitive threats that they must form complex social bonds with, in order to alleviate conflict and tension. A recent article in the BBC noticed this difference (entitled *Men may have evolved better 'making up' skills*), in that men form closer bonds than women, after brutal fights and competitions. They're better at reconciling with one another, to form groups; bonding through activities and shared experiences that may or may not have emotionally complex significance. Even when it comes to life-threatening activities, like war, the positive reasons that men frequently cite to justify involvement, is brotherhood, camaraderie, and cooperation toward a mutually beneficial goal. These concepts are relatively alien to women. Women struggle with teamwork, and do not easily understand or appreciate the process of working with each other toward a goal. Working together is not how they form bonds with each other - emotional vulnerability is. This is precisely why redefining an alpha from someone supported by betas for his character, ability, and virtue (as the Romans understood it) to someone that merely has the attention of women, is destructive. Women didnt evolve to participate in groups coordinated enough to track and kill a mammoth. Women dont bond through physical exertion or by working together. Instead, women bond through emotion, trust, and manipulation. Several studies found that young girls form early friendships by telling each other secrets - because making fun of the new girls clothes or confessing a crush on a boy give girls some sort of mutual leverage over each other. Sharing emotional vulnerability in this way makes women more likely to trust each other. But the fact remains, the same reasons for why women find teamwork difficult, relate to why their preferences shouldn't inform what an alpha is. Among other things, this ultimately demonstrates that although we no longer carry spears on a hunt, our innate behaviors have shifted relatively little since the last ice age (which wasnt that many generations ago, if you think about it). Alphas and betas still exist, and women want to control alphas  who instead of hunting animals, now excel at sports, financial planning, corporate/military promotion, etc. Frequently, men seek out positions simply for female attention. In other words, analogizing this with rams: while rams compete for females by giving each other brain damage (female rams avoids suitors that havent fought over them), humans created society to meet the passive aggressive desires of women. The question is: why is this worth aspiring to? ###REDEFINING ALPHA As our species has developed, its clear that the classical definition of an alpha is meaningless. Men, naturally seeking teamwork, find themselves led to slaughter in pointless wars, to shoot and police each other in the streets, and rob each other through elaborate pyramid schemes. This is socially dysfunctional, and it is informed by a desire to become the alpha that women want - not the alpha as they once were (which were men that earned the respect and loyalty of other men). Men are struggling to be the Neolithic alpha whose troupe of betas dragged a mastodon into the village. But instead of an outcome that leaves the proverbial village fed, this new alpha practices a form of cannibalism. But let me tell you, there is more to life than eating, fucking, and living by the irrational preferences of women. The more women you fuck, the more you will recognize this to be true. Female sexual preference is a dead-end for the entire species. ###BROADEN THE HORIZON If we valued men for their skills and abilities, independent of the quality and number of women theyve had sex with; wed find the alphas that women and beta men frequently overlook. These alphas would likely include men like Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, and even Stephen Hawking. Women sometimes say they like intelligence (because intelligent men can be manipulated to give them resources), but history continually shows this to be an untruth. In practice, women dont find intelligent men all that attractive, though they like intellect when its put to use for them. After two sons, Einsteins wife left him, after which he went on to develop general and special relativity. He gave her much of the financial award from his Nobel Prize, because she wanted it. After that, a few girlfriends predictably appeared. Young Stephen Hawking (although not yet wheelchair bound) could not participate in a Neolithic hunt. He wasn't ugly, and his wife was pretty, but its unlikely that Hawking had many sexual partners. If judged by the metric of sex, he wouldn't be considered a success. Still better than Newton. Allegedly, Newton was an emotionally distant shut-in that avoided women while developing calculus and discovering gravity. He never had a girlfriend to marry, and died without children. Though one of the most important people to have lived, Newton failed by evolutionary standards. But there are men out there, myself included, that dont give one fuck about Newtons lack of a sex life. His value, as a man, is unrelated and unlimited by whatever value women assumed he had. Think of him as the hunter that realized theres something beyond vying for the mercurial attention of women. Men like that are a sobering necessity. And Hawking, though confined to a wheelchair, used his hunter aptitude to track down specific (and counter-intuitive) behaviors of black holes. These men (as systematic problem-solvers) embody textbook descriptions of alphas. Just as the Neolithic hunters that learned and used star positions to track seasons and predict animal migrations were better hunters, so too were these men. The reason this goes unrecognized, is because they did not lead a group of traditional beta followers. ###BE LIMITLESS There are numerous examples of why it's irrational to determine the value of a man by viewing them relative to a caricature of an ""alpha"" that's been drawn by women. The amusing thing about humans is that while they blatantly notice that a male ram ruins its brain for the opportunity to ejaculate in an ewe, they dont understand their own self-destructive tendencies, for the same ends. Apes and humans are more socially complex than rams, but often just as lacking in introspection. Which is to say, if humans are ever going to truly rise above being animals, it will require creating a vision for themselves that isn't constrained by the narrow path that women tend to reward with sex. If men had never deviated from that path, there wouldn't be electricity to brighten the screen in front of you, let alone any algorithms to facilitate it being there. The male aptitude for teamwork is the only way out of a rat race that traps us into bucking heads for the aimless affection of women. It's important to remember that theres a universe beyond, if we can only rise above the petty instincts that inhibit potential. "
88,vulnerability,TheRedPill,The Shit Test,39,57407o,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/57407o/the_shit_test/,2016-10-13 00:19:08,"Just the name of it doesnt sound too good, does it? A shit test is where a woman challenges or questions a man on his behaviour; or tries to elicit what his core values are through (often kinda mean) questions, during seduction, courting and dating. I bet this sounds like a lot of trouble to you; like something you wouldnt want to have to deal with when youre just trying to take a girl out on a date, or when youve just got home from work. This is why so many times when men get hit with the shit test they react negatively to what they see as a woman using catty remarks to keep a scorecard on them. But what if I was to tell you that the shit test is really just a strong indicator of a womans feelings of vulnerability about herself and attraction towards you? The problem is most guys dont realise that when a woman is slinging all these challenges at them shes not trying to be a bitch by doing it, and that theyre not being a chump for putting up with it. Yes it can be a way of sorting out the men from the pussies and testing that youre a guy worthy of her: yes it can be a way of her saying, Im queen of this litter and I have the power to choose. But thats only half the story. The other (most important) half is that shit tests can show that a woman is attracted to you; and that she feels vulnerable about that attraction. A woman will use a shit test as a way of seeing if youre a man that will stand by her and accept her: warts and all. Whilst you see her as the prettiest, smartest, girl at the party throwing road blocks at you with remarks like: Im thirsty: I cant talk with a man until he buys me a drink. I wish I was hot/ young/ slim/ pretty like that waitress. Shes beautiful, dont you think? Youre far too charming. I think you must be quite the player. Do you want me to tell that joke again more slowly? Youre a little slow, arent you? A lot of the time these mean remarks are just hiding her insecurities about whether youll stick around when shes got no make-up on and has morning breath. Sometimes consciously, sometimes subconsciously, shes testing your attraction and commitment to her. She wants to know that youll still adore her, above all the other girls, when you hit the inevitable trials a relationship throws up later on. Most PUAs would tell you to change the subject if she shit tests you. Thats great if you want a fast route into her pants: but real, long lasting attraction is about being able to be take the strong, masculine position and reassure her, Its ok, calm down, youre amazing just as you are. Keep your tone of voice confident, and this isnt being weak: this is being strong and smart. You need to understand that shes not angry at you when she snaps at you for not remembering the shopping, or glares at you for catching the waitresss eye. These shit tests, that come later on in the dating stage, are an expression of her own insecurities. A guys just got to realise that moment is about her, not about you. Women sometimes dont even recognize their own needs until they creep up on us at a moment where were maybe not feeling that attractive ourselves. Our needs could be for love, passion or just remembering to send her a text to say goodnight. What seems like a minor offence to you, like sneaking a peak at a pretty blondes butt, can turn into a major crime when combined with a womans own insecurities that can be tough to control. Even after the initial moment of a shit test has passed, we can keep acting worse and worse even after the initial crisis has been solved. To a guys mind you may think Why is she still mad? I thought we dealt with that problem whilst the woman still feels emotional about the fact she let you see some her vulnerability, and that shes not perfect. This can create a pretty negative cycle of arguments which Im sure all of us can relate to. The best thing a guy can do in this case is to offer the woman some security through his masculine presence: dont try and rationalise everything that she does but have the strength to give stability where shes feeling unstable. Often the best way to do this is just to hold her. Even the shit test lines you get earlier on in courting and dating can often be handled the same way:  By not reacting negatively, but by being assured enough in yourself, that you can provide support to her.  By having that strength of masculine presence to resist the challenges she throws at you.  By seeing her catty remarks as a way of inciting sexual tension and desire in a man shes considering as a partner.  By being James Bond cool, collected, and confident enough to turn her negative emotions into positive examples of your masculinity. Here are some great examples of how you could turn around the shit tests she said to you earlier, into great ways to demonstrate how attractive you are as a man: I was about to get you a drink, but I didnt want you to think I wanted to get you drunk. I quite like you just like this, actually. The waitress is okay (then look at her like with desire), but youre the hottest girl here (watch her blush) Of course Im a player, just looking for the right woman to reform me. I guess Ill just have to prove you wrong about how smart I am though when we have our first date next week. Just remember, if you can maintain the strong, masculine position in her life whilst she momentarily loses control through a catty remark, or has a full blown melt down, it will not only stabilise your bond with her but will create more attraction. Recognise that shit tests often come from her vulnerabilities, and not your mistakes. Sail over these obstacles and shell find you even sexier. "

AWALT. Body: Met a girl I thought was so perfect. We had a good relationship, or so I thought. Thought the virginity and religious thing along with her intelligence made her ""different"". I maintain my strong, alpha frame for 4 weeks and take her virginity (many times over). Then, I cave to beta tendencies. My friends, this was my gravest mistake. I have come very far since beginning my RedPill journey, and now that my life is on track to being wildly successful, I thought it was time to ""try a relationship with my ideal girl"". I have been getting much better at game, and picked her up in the library. Things are good for several weeks, I believe because of the traits listed before hand that I can be ""open, honest, and vulnerable"" with her. How wrong I was. I am very, very busy - so I would go days without talking to her at times, and she began to build a resentment against me. This, coupled with my openness and vulnerability spelled my downfall. Said more and more beta things thinking the whole time ""Oh she is so different"". HA! What a joke! One day, I didn't talk to her for ~3 days or so, I try calling after that. To tell her I was so very busy (starting own business, being scouted for Ivy League programs in a very competitive field, compete in sports, etc) and no answer. I run into her, she says she can't do it anymore. She says she is ""too busy for this, needs to refocus on life, I don't need her"" all these things. I played it cool, said alright we'll get back together. A week later I see her with another man, I flirt heavily with other girls right next to her and she immediately reacts in the typical female ways. Gentleman, please, please, please - always remember - AWALT. Even if she is a virgin, religious, intelligent - ANYTHING you could think of that makes her ""different"" - she is the same. It came as such a disappointment to me, I feel loss because of the mental construct of her I built in my mind. Never forget - AWALT. Think twice before being ""vulnerable"" and ""open"" gentleman, think twice. And as said, NEVER place your value in a woman, EVER. They will spit you right back out and punish you for being so naive. Whats even worse: I have had many fortunate events in my life happen since our break. (Have of course started pursuing/hooking up with other women as well) - every time I see her, I am so happy and loving - and she is so, so spiteful - so angry at my success. All the talk of how much she values religion, compassion, rationality, all of it right out the window. The ""being too busy, etc"" - all lies. See her for hours one night just talking, staring at me, almost begging to say ""Look! Look at me! I broke things off with you and now I'm with other guys! Doesn't it hurt??"" as I have fun with my friends and other women (social proof is a hell of a thing). HA - I will never give her that validation, every time she sees me I am so happy, loving of life, indifferent - and that is all I will ever be, and never again will I fall into this trap. Gentleman, please let this be a warning. The beta was still alive and well in me, even years after beginning my journey.

Men typically want to have sex for release (Freedom), while women have sex to be fulfilled. (exercising power can feel fulfilling to women). Asides from the obvious differences (Penetration vs being penetrated) Orgasms, hormones, different regions of the brain, and neurotransmitters are different between men and women during sex. With so many differences during sex comes with different results afterwards. &amp;nbsp; **Before and After Sex:** The biggest, and most notable difference in sex between men and women is the different hormones released during orgasm. Many of the same hormones are release, but in different quantities. * **The main hormone released in Male orgasms is Serotonin.** It does many things, but succinctly it's a feel good hormone, makes us happy. Many people who are going through depression have a Serotonin deficiency. * **The main hormone released in Female orgasms is Oxytocin.** Again you could read a text book on everything it does, but to make it short Oxytocin is responsible for bonding and falling in love. It also affects trust. **Women fall in love, men fall asleep**(With a smile). While a women may be interested in you, you really don't matter that much to her until you fuck her. (even if you do fuck her, if she's had a lot of sexual partners this might not mean much). **Women cannot help but emotionally bond with people they have sex with.** If you look at this from an evolutionary perspective it makes perfect sense. Men want to get that high, and be released from their bodily desires, while a women on the other hand (With the possibility of getting pregnant) needs to bond with her mate for survival. It also makes sense for her to trust her mate even more during the conception of a child. (Dependency) Besides actual emotional bonding, there are other very strong reasons for the power shift after sex. Women's most powerful sense of agency is her sexuality. **Sex is a form of surrender for a women, and a conquest for a man.** *What power does a conquered land have over it's ruler?* She has already given everything she has to over, and it puts her in a state of vulnerability (Emotionally, and physically). **Try it for yourself:** It's easier to notice on the outside looking in IMO. If you have friends starting a new relationship, pay attention to them and especially when they have sex for the first time. I'm willing to bet that's when she realizes she's in love. Or simply just think of any of your interactions with women before and after you've had sex with them, (You are fucking them good right?) &amp;nbsp; **What this means and why it's relevant:** *If you're, ""Waiting until she's ready,"" or hoping you'll be that, ""Special someone"" (Worthy of sex) before you fuck, you're waisting your time.* Until you fuck her, you don't have any significance in her life (if you're not fucking her someone else is). The sooner you lay her down, the sooner the power balance shifts in the relationship to your favor. Here's another couple of good reasons why you should push for FNL's. * If you can have something, why not take it? * If you're not escalating you're drying her out * She wants you to fuck her * As a man you were born to put your P in her V * Successful FNL's set a good precedence in the relationship * You gain the upper hand in the relationship. &amp;nbsp; Sumery: Once you put your P in her V you have the upper hand in the relationship. Do so as quickly as possible for the best results. Good luck brothers. Edit: FNL = First Night Lay "
91,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Your new self-esteem may be a vulnerability -- Dealing with her compliments,162,50zxyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/50zxyt/your_new_selfesteem_may_be_a_vulnerability/,2016-09-04 03:59:14,"**Summary**: Women covertly use compliments to get you addicted. Being stoic to female validation will protect your sense of self as well as her attraction to you. --- I felt compelled to write this because I haven't seen it explicitly mentioned anywhere in Rollo/Pook/sidebar. If you've internalized the Red Pill and have improved your SMV, you've probably left a lot of previous vulnerabilites behind; most importantly, you can no longer be convinced that She's the One good girl Unicorn that's worth dropping your own priorities and dreams for. Hopefully you've gotten more pleasure out of your growing sense of self than any women/sex, but with this comes a new vulnerability. And women can smell it on you: it's your growing ego. Their strategy is this: make him feel alpha, he'll get addicted to the feeling and start to lose interest in women that don't make him feel that way. The same way women feel ""chemistry"" when a guy is attractive, a reformed beta will feel ""chemistry"" when their girl treats him like a king (Please note: ""strategy"" does *not* mean *conscious long-term strategy*, it means women like the reaction/commitment they get when they display this behavior). The first time you get these compliments it feels like victory, like you've finally made it and all that work has paid off: * ""I didn't know a dick could feel so good"" * ""I've never been fucked so well"" * ""You are literally the best looking person I know"" * ""You have the best body I've ever seen close up"" * ""That was the best orgasm I've had in my life"" * ""You're the smartest person I know"" Look familiar? Yeah, she tells me the same shit, bro. Girls you're not fucking will admit to you that they will give false compliments to ""make their boyfriend feel better"". They can see the effect their compliments have on you - you're suddenly more open and appreciative of her. It's a tool they're using. You're still not a special snowflake. --- Regardless of whether the compliments are genuine or not or somewhere in between, this is the lesson. **Lesson:** **You must ignore female validation. Your ego and sense of self are still developing and ultimately must stand strong without external (especially female) support**. We can talk about the theoretical ego vs self-esteem vs. egolessness later - you're not ready for that discussion until you establish a strong worldly (i.e. rooted in reality) pride first. So take the compliment, enjoy it like you would any shit test or tactic - **ignoring it will imply that you're used to getting these compliments all the time** - and smirk knowing that she has no more power over you now than before."
92,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Underlying Social Significance of Vulnerability to Females,0,52ztgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/52ztgs/underlying_social_significance_of_vulnerability/,2016-09-16 12:25:09,"Continuing off of many similar posts where the content preaches stoicism and holding frame in front of females, I want to elaborate the social processes that explain why one must not cry in front of a female whether they are friends or a significant other. By crying, I do not mean a single tear rolling off the cheek but showing overt stress, laying your problems on them, or bawling your eyes out. We already understand that evolution-wise, men cannot display weakness because it is not a desirable trait to pass on and doing so lowers your SMV. Many of us have already seen the naturally-selected Penis fly trap drying mechanism in action after crying. But think about the average female growing up; the princesses of their parents and oneitis of countless males passing through their lives. Most, if not all, females have the advantage of this feminist society and orbiters telling them they are to be worshiped and coddled because they are girls. Their fathers do not cry to them about their adult problems, their meals are paid for under the guise of chivalry, and white knights rush to defend them online across the world at the expense of nothing. Let's not even include the popular girls growing up or the social media famous models that have plethora of supplicants vying for their attention. With all this validation at the drop of a dime, how are they expected to be equipped to deal with other people's problems? To be honest, men don't even like hearing other people's problems but we do because we shoulder the burden of being expected to take care of our women, or moral obligation in being a bro. Of course, that is not to say that there are not exceptions. A kind-hearted wife might handle a moment of weakness in the name of ""sickness and in health"", but do not push your luck. It is simply biological programming and social conditioning that leads to this and that is why exceptions are exceptions for a reason. An ending note: I believe the opportunity to be weak in front of a female is fine if you are platonic or another female friend talking about her boyfriend problems, but do not confuse this as a reliable pathway to attraction towards you."
93,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Recent female college grad discusses how many females really feel about modern day hookup culture.,254,4v6g79,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4v6g79/recent_female_college_grad_discusses_how_many/,2016-07-29 23:01:21,"I recently posted a link to a radio interview where a young college student seemed very enthusiastic about casual sex and the hookup culture. Being involved in higher education, I read a few blogs and there seems to be differing opinions on what the younger generation really feels about their sex lives being mostly casual, and a lot less romantic, during their college years. Leah Fessler has recently written two articles on this topic. The most recent one I just discovered can be found here: URL Some of the highlights: Leah had a high school boyfriend with whom she lost her virginity to at 16. It was the traditional romantic way to do so from what I gather. She wrote that she felt as if she went away to college not overly experienced, but not really inexperienced either. She writes about the current state of things: *From dance floors to bedrooms, everyone was hooking upmyself included. The popular media most frequently characterizes hookup culture as a series of emotionless one-night stands. At Middlebury, such casual hookups definitely occur. **Far more frequent, however, were pseudo-relationships**, the mutant children of meaningless sex and loving partnerships. Two students consistently hook up with one anotherand typically, only each otherfor weeks, months, even years. Yet per unspoken social code, neither party is permitted emotional involvement, commitment, or vulnerability. To call them exclusive would be clingy, or even crazy.* She gives us great insight into how these 'relationships' form and work: *The winter of my junior year, I asked Ben, a quiet, smart philosophy major with bright blue eyes, to a wine and cheese party. We saw each other for a few months. On weekends Id text him around 10 pm, usually somewhat drunk. Wed meet at one of our dorm rooms, debate philosophy and Fleet Foxes lyrics, talk about our families and aspirations, and then have sex until he came. Give or take some weeknight Netflix-watching or walks in town, I cycled through this routine with at least five guys by senior year.* Additionally, Leah gives some great insight on what this lifestyle is likely doing to young women: *After I began having sex with these guys, the power balance always tipped. A few hookups in, Id begin to obsess, primarily about the ambiguity of it all. My friends and I would analyze incessantly: Does he like me? Do you like him? He hasnt texted in a day. Read this text. Im so confused. He said he didnt want anything, but keeps asking to hang out. When Ben fell asleep, Id pretend to doze off as well. During the night, Id pull the covers or brush his toes, craving an arm around my waist. Id analyze snippets of our conversation. Sometimes Id leave an earring on his bedside table when I left, before he woke up. A reason to come back. With time, inevitably, came attachment. And with attachment came shame, anxiety, and emptiness. My girlfriends and I were top students, scientists, artists, and leaders. We could advocate for anythingexcept for our own bodies. We won accolades from our professors, but the men we were sleeping with wouldnt even eat breakfast with us the next morning. Whats worse, we really thought of the situation in those terms: He didnt ask to grab breakfast, so I walked home. My girlfriends and I were top students, scientists, artists, and leaders. We could advocate for anythingexcept for our own bodies. We were desperate to know what it felt like to be wanted; desperate for a chance at intimacy. Desperate for a hand held in daylight, for public affirmation of desire typically expressed only after too many drinks. Desperate to try commitment, then decide if it wasnt working, rather than being prematurely cut off from it.* So Leah decides to write a thesis about hookup culture and some survey results were: *After interviewing 75 male and female students and analyzing over 300 online surveys, the solidarity was undeniable: 100% of female interviewees and three-quarters of female survey respondents stated a clear preference for committed relationships. ... Only 8% of about 25 female respondents who said they were presently in pseudo-relationships reported being happy with their situation.* There are a lot of quotes from other young females, and the feelings they are left with can't be good for their mental health. I'm sure many can get over it, but it seems to me that forming lasting bonds, ie: marriage, might end up being very hard for those in the 18-24 year old age range. It seems dating is all but dead for the vast majority of today's college students. There is a lot of good stuff in the article, so I highly recommend reading the whole thing. She also wrote another article somewhat related on the subject last year. I found it a pretty good read for the most part. I definitely seem some RP bits in certain areas, especially the difference in men and women and sexual attraction. Here is that article: URL"
94,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Emotional Control,48,4v7a2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4v7a2k/emotional_control/,2016-07-30 01:56:43,"**Summary:** Emotional control in a Red Pill context ensures the perception of an invulnerable man. **Body:** A topic I believe that could use some expansion is the benefit of emotional control in a mans life. When I say emotional control, I do not mean the suppression of emotions, but the proper display of them in a Red Pill context. This context serves as the foundation for emotional display, while also admitting that men have emotions and use them. The problem we have currently in an equalist definition of gender (while hypocritically catering to the feminine), is that displays of emotion more reserved for women are encouraged in men as well. Beta males jump on this opportunity to showcase their emotions as they still follow the social framework that *women say what they mean*. Any opportunity to showcase this perceived insight into the feminine, by believing what they say, and you have a whole culture of men trying to out e-mote one another. This is basic Red Pill: the incentive for men to display their emotions is the false belief they will be rewarded for their ability to understand, or communicate on an emotional level with women. The theory goes that like attracts like, that more feminine displays of emotion allows men to better relate to women, in another instance of the Beta asserting hes *different* than those other assholes she regularly bemoans about. In a Red Pill context most men already understand on a basic level that what she says does not correlate with what she means. This at first sounds illogical, and it would be under a perspective of a blue pill worldview. This worldview, as stated above, believes in an equalist definition of gender. If men believe women communicate overtly as men do, then men will also believe her when she says she deserves to know what hes feeling. However, what the Red Pill teaches is that she doesnt communicate overtly, but rather covertly. This serves as the bed rock for understanding more intricate levels of Red Pill thought including the need for emotional control. While we would like to claim were complete rational agents its painfully obvious were still at the mercy of our emotions. They still serve a functional purpose and theyre something were not going to run away from. What Im advocating is the proper display of emotion in a Red Pill context, as opposed to the display of emotion in a Blue Pill context. One seeks to ensure emotions are kept in check to continue the perception of a man who is *invulnerable* who can handle the stress of everyday life, and if need be her shit as well. The other seeks to display emotions in the hope showing a sense of *vulnerability* will make him more in tune with what women say they want: a caring, compassionate, sensitive partner not what they actually want. Under a Red Pill context, emotional control seeks the line of ensuring that our emotions do not run away on us and ruin a perception of a man that is invulnerable. Again this is basic Red Pill: Women will never appreciate the stress, pain, sorrow, and difficulty it means to be a man. Not in a million years will they understand the sacrifice required to meet her egregious level of expectations whether that is the continual financial stability in a demanding job, nor the emotional support of her and her children. This is something she is biologically incapable of understanding, nor able to empathize in a way you would like. At the very least knowing this is simple pragmatism. There is no gain in rolling over and showing a sense of vulnerability in the hope she will appreciate it. **Hurricane** This sense of pragmatism in regards to emotional control serves as the foundation to how emotions should be expressed, and who to share them with. In my other post called [Boys Dont Cry](URL I dived in to the need to reign in emotions that destroy a sense of invulnerability. This perception plays into a womans hypergamous instinct of a man that is not manipulated by emotional terrorism, nor does he move simply because her emotions are unchecked. Regardless of how often women cry about men not sharing their feelings, this is not a call for one to vomit his most deepest struggles to her. Invariably, for all their crying about hard to read men, this is exactly the difference that attracts her to him. Less really is more, and its our differences that make men attractive, not our similarities. She needs to know that you are the wall that separates her willingness to lose control of her emotions, and your incessant drive to not give into them. Any demand that you communicate with her by expressing your deepest feelings is simply a shit-test to get you to abandon your frame. Once you enter her frame youve lost control of the interaction, and she will lose respect. If she is in your frame then youre free to poke at her emotional instability to get your desired results. This is why neg hits are so effective along with the idea of Amused Mastery. Any uncontrollable outburst from her is met with a knowing smirk that shes not taken seriously, and her emotional outburst have little to no effect on your daily life. This bulwark is in direct contrast to the hurricane that is her instability, and reassures her that youre a man that gets it. There is a lot to talk about in regards to emotional control, and this post doesnt do it justice. I purposely didnt mention a specific emotion because of the impossibility of arguing one emotion is better than another. Every man has a different situational context when it comes to using a specific emotion. What is better is to mull over if expressing this particular emotion in a specific proportion will better contribute to a perception of strength and invulnerability, or will it do the opposite? **Conclusion:** * Betas out e-mote one another * She can't empathize with a man's emotional struggles * Emotional control shows a man who is invulnerable This is the full post but I also write [here](URL if interested.

95,vulnerability,TheRedPill,The Importance Of Privacy,15,4vwe16,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4vwe16/the_importance_of_privacy/,2016-08-03 12:53:16,"**Introduction** &amp;nbsp; Hello gentlemen, &amp;nbsp; As many of you know, the beautiful world of Internet tends to leak information, putting your privacy at risk. A wise RP man knows that in order to have more plates, he must not let the other plates *directly* know that he is meeting up with other women. And such is information science. Your data should not be directly accessible to other people in any way or form, including Google searches, emails, websites, etc. Anything that is put out there in the ""cloud,"" is accessible by a third-party. Although companies such as Google state that they take your privacy seriously, there is always and I mean *always* room for vulnerability. That vulnerability could be Google itself one day, but you don't know that. So it's best to thread lightly and ensure that your information is protected as much as it could be. &amp;nbsp; **Basic Procedures** &amp;nbsp; With that said, let's go over some basic procedures to protect your privacy. &amp;nbsp; 1. **Don't store usernames and passwords and credit card information on your computer or through Google documents and any cloud service such as iCloud** Although Google and Apple and DropBox companies try their best to secure your files, there may be a vulnerability allowing another user access to that particular file. For instance, Google allows you to change the sharing settings, so there could be a chance another person could hop to the URL of the file and obtain it there. Go to Google Chrome or any browser's settings and turn off ""Save Credit Card Information"" and ""Save Location Settings"" and so on. 2. **Do monthly backups** If there is a virus on your computer or malicious script running through command prompt or terminal, your computer could be easily wiped or your information could be sent to a third party via the Internet. Sometimes you may lose your files as a result. How? Well if you were to look this up, all it takes is one script or one terminal command and your entire file directly can be recursively deleted, which happened to my computer last summer as a result of a web virus. 3. **Avoid peer-to-peer file sharing services** Torrenting makes your computer susceptible to viruses. Plus, your IP is shared with the other users. What does that mean? Well, anyone could easily track your router and location and send repetitive requests, crashing your computer or your router. And malicious files can be easily sent to your computer directly, once the person knows your IP. Avoid file sharing services at all costs. 4. **Install anti-virus** You don't have to go crazy and get the most expensive anti-virus software. Here's a hint: the best anti-virus software tends to be free. So go for Windows Defender. Go for Avast Free. You get the picture. You'd be surprised how many attacks my antivirus software has prevented by implementing a web shield. 5. **Make alternative emails** Don't ever list your default email on websites that ask for your email to sign-up. These companies will bombard your email with thrash and spam and sell your email to third-parties. Again, breach in data. Make extra emails for such events. 6. **Turn off location services** A lot of mobile apps request location services. Try to manually enter your location, so that way apps don't have access to the location services feature of the phone, which allows the app to obtain coordinates of your location, as opposed to manually entering a city name, which is more secure. &amp;nbsp; **Advanced Procedures** &amp;nbsp; This part is more RP related. &amp;nbsp; 1. **Avoid/delete/disable social media accounts** This may get a bit controversial and you might actually feel fine with having your social media account. But personally I've found there to be many stalkers. In addition, social media could potentially (probably) be monitored. What does that mean? Well, that means there is a third-party tracking where you take your photos, what you do in life, what information you share with others, you sharing your life events, etc. Avoid the ""Facebook Official."" Again, anything that is put out there can and will be used against you one day. 2. **Save texts, emails, photos, and any other digital files from your plates ONS girlfriend etc** You want any form of evidence to prove your innocence if you are blamed for something that you did not do. Remember, the system is not in the favor of men. 3. **Don't disclose private information to anyone at all, including professors, friends, police, girlfriend, cousins, relatives, acquaintances, personnel, etc** Again, anything that is put out there can and WILL be used against you. 4. **Lie** Stop being a nice guy and being extremely truthful. Understand that if you get yourself in trouble one day and you need a way out, lie. Don't disclose information to people that will use it against you. Also, don't come up with stupid lies that can also be used against you. Make yourself plausible. &amp;nbsp; **Summary** &amp;nbsp; Learn to protect your information by not disclosing too much information. Trust yourself and close family only. Gossip is a real thing, so avoid it! Delete social media if at all possible. Avoid peer-to-peer services. Don't store private information on the web and cloud services such as Google Drive and iCloud. And lastly, keep your hands clean and wipe the cum off that bitch's face. "

Afterwards, I engaged in a conversation with the one I was interested in. We were having a good dialogue going, but I immediately ran out of things to say. I started noticing I was getting bored, then I noticed she was getting bored. She was reflecting back everything I was feeling, all because I was wasnt creating the right emotions in her mind. Im still lacking in that department, even though Im a very animated communicator. How could that be? The second set went a little bit better. I made stupid jokes about how the drinks at this place are overpriced and the weird cross eyed bouncer who kept looking at me. It made her laugh, so I guess thats a plus. Her eyes were dilated, she was sharing stories with me, it seemed like the interaction was going well. But then it happened again, I started forcing the conversation, and creating new reasons to keep talking. I saw her getting bored so just said nice to meet you and I kept it moving. My friend later pulled me aside and said, dude, why arent you at least going for the number? I told him I was scared of giving a fuck, I was scared of showing vulnerability. I was more scared of having a long convo with an attractive woman and not getting the number more than anything else, I didnt care about anything else. He told me if I kept it up I was never going to take it to the next level. Next was a set of 3 girls from Canada and all 3 were smoking hot. I helped them get a picture in front of the Empire State Building, and then they asked me to get in a picture with them. Me and my friends hung out with them for the rest of the night (just chilling, having fun, teasing etc.). This was the best set of the night, here I was getting the best receptions. The girl I was mainly talking to was cool as fuck, this one I tried escalating with. When were talking, I tried subtle touches on her arms and hands (she was ok with it). Later on we got touchier as we exchanged hugs here and there, I was able to grab her waist, and put my arm around her and she never stopped me from doing anything (good signs I guess?). I later I told her, hey, you better send me those pictures! which she responded with, I know, I know youre asking for my number haha. I said, nahhhh, I just want the pictures haha. Her friend kept giving me this nod like, yeah shes yours for the taking type of nod. If I told this girl to kiss me I know I would of gotten a make out, but I never escalated that far. My friend had a make out with her sister, and the other girl was just talking to my other friend (she has a boyfriend back home and didnt show any signs of interest). Afterwards, it got too late so me and my friends said goodbye and went home. I didnt get anything significant, but I had fun that night. I just wish I could get out of my head, show these girls my fun side. Any advice?"
97,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Never Get Complacent &amp; Be Careful Of Your Male Friends,3,4wzevg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4wzevg/never_get_complacent_be_careful_of_your_male/,2016-08-10 10:18:00,"Me and my childhood friend, lets call him Joe, have been best friends since grade 8. He moved away the first year I met him but somehow we managed to stay best friends for the next 10 years. Despite the distance, we grew up together because wed meet up every weekend. Even after I moved to a new city for college, we still hang out when I come back in the summers. People have mistaken us for brothers several times. Anyways, when I found TRP a few years ago and started improving myself, I could tell there was some jealously and resentment in his eyes. I had read that such things happen when you start implementing TRP into your life, but Joe was my best friend so I didnt next him or hold a grudge against him. I continued to improve myself and be more assertive and people followed my lead in social situations, him included. However, I never let my guard down and never showed weakness or vulnerability, not even to Joe. Fast forward to this summer upon returning home for summer break. Im coming off a mediocre year. I got too complacent during the school year and didnt socialize/game as much, didnt eat as healthy, didnt go as hard in the gym. Just really exhausted from prior years of exerting myself. What tipped the scale though was when I got fired from my summer job, which is mostly the reason I return home for the summers. I figured it was too late to find job at this point as I was only going to stay there for about 3 months so I basically just stayed at home, smoked weed and ate junk food till my departure, occasionally hanging out with friends. My frame and confidence were absolutely shot. On my last day, I went to hang out with Joe at my other friends house. My other friend is a hard core stoner and smokes some really strong stuff called shatter or whatever the fuck its called. I hadnt eaten anything all day but it was my last day so I thought what the hell and took a fat rip. I dont think Ive ever been that high in my life. Literally thought I was tripping on LSD. But this trip was enlightening as fuck. I became super anxious, crippled with insecurity and was fearful to even converse with Joe and my friend. I was hyper-aware of my own body language yet I couldnt help but close up. I just felt inadequate and this was when I realized how bad by inner game had become. I racked my brain for TRP to help me as its always proven to give me comfort and guidance in uncomfortable situations and what my brain came up with was: Relax. these are your male friends, you can show weakness to them. Upon thinking this, I told my friends that Im really fucked up and cant function. I think they already had an idea of how stoned I was by how quiet and closed up I was but heres where my heart fucking breaks. Joe starts making fun of me and then tries to coerce me to take another rip, saying itll help me relax, with the most devilishly contorted smile. He literally got up out of his chair, sat beside me, put his arm around me, and started trying to pressure me. It was so fucked up man. How can I even begin to describe the panic you feel when youre in such a vulnerable state and your oldest friend tries to destroy you. If I handnt been so high I wouldve confronted him, maybe even punched him, but I just continued to say ill do it later until he finally gave up. We barely spoke the rest of the night. When I left for the airport the next morning, he was the only friend to not text/call me goodbye. Never been more motivated to re-up on TRP. Be careful who you call friends and never drop your guard."
98,vulnerability,TheRedPill,My Biggest Red Pill Lessons after Three Years on TRP [Part 1],87,4xdk25,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4xdk25/my_biggest_red_pill_lessons_after_three_years_on/,2016-08-12 23:38:27,"So, I recently signed up to give a presentation on ""the true nature of women"" to a closed and private men's club in [REDACTED]... and I'm just starting to write my speech now, so to collect my thoughts, I thought I'd write a post on the most important Red Pill lessons I've gotten from this sub, and the Manosphere in general, over the past three years. **1. A woman's love is predicated on attraction, and her attraction is predicated on value** The importance of this, for me, cannot be overstated- and I suspect this is the most important lesson for the vast majority of men who find the Manosphere and are open to our ideas. I think the minority of men here are the types who couldn't get a kiss and couldn't understand why.. and even though we stand to help all men in need, I believe the majority of men here understand what it takes to initially attract a woman, initially manage a relationship, but end up confused when the gears shift to a long-term emotionally charged relationship. I remember when the tides changed in my last long-term relationship, it was almost palatable in that moment, and even if I didn't have the vocabulary to understand what was happening consciously, I was aware something shifted. To that point, I had gamed my girlfriend pretty good... the sex was amazing, and I had her wrapped around my finger, kissing my ass, and trying to gain my approval. One early morning, after smoking weed and drowning in LSD, she had a total emotional breakdown where she told me how this was *too hard on her emotions*, and that she was *in love with me* but didn't think I felt the same way, and was afraid- yes, *afraid*- that I was *just using her* and would leave her for the next girl.... or, as translated with a red pill awareness, everything I had been doing had worked and, and even if I quelled the situation a bit in that moment (probably with light teasing until I got a laugh out of her, and telling her to relax, that I *liked* her, etc.), the correct course of action would have been to maintain the same practices. But, pre-red pill, pre-Manosphere- in the dark and lonely ocean that was 2008, I made the mistake of *listening to her* and *taking her emotions seriously* (not just as a device to manipulate me, which they most assuredly were- even if unwittingly on her part), and this moment hit me hard. I felt guilty and broke down (mistake), I told her that I loved her and I'd never leave her for another girl (mistake), and that I was going to be better from then on and appreciate her more (deathblow mistake.... she wins, FATALITY). You can guess how the rest of that relationship went. It took four more years for it to play-out in full- four long years- and by the end of it I was a fat, whimpering, low-t cuck. Between that relationship ending, and before finding the Manosphere, this scenario played itself out a few more times, in varying lengths- where I used my (admittedly very good) natural game, got the girl interested, thought I could ease up a bit and *be myself*, and her interest quickly evaporated. So, like I said, most men here understand the natural dance of initial attraction, and the natural game involved in those highly sexual first stages of dating, but lose their marbles when emotions are introduced and a long-term relationship is commenced. This happens through a toxic combination of his leaning-into emotions without understanding them, and the social conditioning telling him that a good man is a man who puts his woman first. Social conditioning tells us that WOMEN ARE WONDERFUL, or in other words, women are naturally morally virtuous. Social conditioning tells us that a woman's love is a kind of verbal contract, and, once earned, she will forever respect a man's kindness and willingness to show vulnerability- and if her love begins to wane, the man must focus on his emotions even harder. Men are easily tricked by this because this is how men understand love... this is what is called sympathetic love, or unconditional love- quite literally, love that is given without the necessity of the loved one meeting specific conditions. Ever wonder why you see so many decently attractive men in long-term relationships with fat girls? That's why. So you put all this bullshit in a blender- the idea that women are inherently great people, that a woman's love is a solid verbal contract, that what she most wants is a man to show vulnerability, and society telling a man that men and women are the same, and love the same way, and you end up with complete disaster. This is the my #1 Red Pill Lesson because without it, it is *literally impossible* to have a functional long-term relationship... even if she gets too fat to leave, and you die ""happily married,"" she's going to make your life hell. **Lesson: Men and women do not love equally; men love sympathetically, or unconditionally, and women love conditionally- predicated on attraction.** **Related reading:** **[The Emotional Pedestal and Sympathetic Manipulation](URL [The Death Of Male Authenticity](URL The Ladys Dressing Room \(1732\) and the Nature of Sympathetic Love](URL (&lt;-- proof that The Red Pill- the truth about women- isn't something new, or merely a response to third-wave Feminism, but that female nature is eternal). **2. Females desire the maximization of selection, and men compete with one-another to be selected; the modern world has maximized a woman's ability to select, while greatly disabling a man's ability to compete** The story we're told, of course, is that men and women are entirely equal; a story meant to confuse men while empowering women at their expense. Men are taught that being a *good man*, something any sane man wants, entails buying into gender equality... something that entirely hinders their masculine growth and ability to genuinely understand sexual dynamics, which is crucial to a man's sexual success. For women, buying into equality and behaving like beer swilling, cigarette smoking, tattoo covered bad boyz doesn't hinder her sexual success all that much... either she has a decent face, and a good body, or she doesn't- something ugly Harper Lee knew all too well... bottom line is that women always have a pussy, and chances are there is at least one sad dude who'd stick it into some ugly beast. **Remember: pussy is valuable and dick is worthless.** What this means is that a woman's standard of behavior, how clever or funny she is, or what she does with her life has little impact on her sexual success... and the fatter all women get, the less being fat matters, which is the true heart of 'body positivity'... CONVERSELY, a man's behavior, how clever or funny he is, and what he does with his life has incredible impact on his sexual success. In a world of unstigmatized promiscuity and open hypergamy, all a woman needs to do is seem the *most sexually available*- a kind of slut Olympics- in order to maximize her partner selection with hopes that the right man will succumb to her emotional manipulation and choose her as a long-term mate... this is modern female game. The problem with this, however, is that she's probably blowing out her expectations on men who'd gladly use her briefly for sex but who'd never settle down with her long-term, and this will ultimately make partnering up with a lesser man intolerable- this concept is known as the Alpha Widow, and is the greatest stumbling block to long-term female happiness. The original ""Dracula"" was a cautionary tale to warn against sexy trysts with dangerous strangers who have bad intentions. The sexual innocence of the pre-1960s cultural revolution was in-place to limit female hypergamy and create stable families. Women were not meant to have the infinite pool of potential mates to choose from as they do currently with hyper-speed online dating; essentially making the entire world a big city, where the most successful studs are using and disposing of all women in their path. **Lesson: The social conditioning of gender equality greatly limits the sexual success of most men, while open promiscuity/hypergamy met with online dating has infinitely widened a woman's ability to sexually select.** **Related reading: [All vaginas are the same size~!!11 and the Unequal Nature of Equality](URL [Sexual Selection and Teen Mom](URL [Online Dating and Post-Modern Reality](URL [Beta Anxiety and the Vampiric Alpha in Dracula \(1931\)](URL In not wanting to write a gigantic post with a wall of text, throughout the weekend I'm going to be posting my other big Red Pill lessons that I've learned over the past three years in prepping for my presentation.

99,vulnerability,TheRedPill,"Just read three recommended TRP books. Did anyone else find ""Models"" by Mark Manson extremely ""Purple-Pill""?",16,4y43nh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4y43nh/just_read_three_recommended_trp_books_did_anyone/,2016-08-17 16:15:34,"Is it just me, or did anyone else find this book surprisingly ""purple-pill""? With regards to his views on men, there's nothing that comes to mind that I disagreed with. However, his views on women seemed extremely accepting/forgiving. To be clear, they weren't along the lines of ""this is how women are; accept &amp; adapt with it."" They were more along the lines of ""they're vulnerable. It's your fault; deal with it."" He seemed to be empathizing/sympathizing with the women's rationale (which is much different than just understanding). The subtle difference in viewpoints is the difference between a truly ""RedPill"" mindset and a ""purple-pill"" mindset. After reading a recommended books post in this sub, over the past week, I've read ""The Rationale Male"", ""The Manual: What Women Want and How to Give it to them"", and ""Manuals"". Compared to the other two, ""Manuals"" was somewhat of a let down. The only thing that really stuck out to me was his stance/definition on vulnerability (which was something I was already innately aware of, but hadn't considered it in concrete, explicit terms). Other than that, it's almost as if he's advocating truly connecting &amp; falling in love with women (which as most of us know, is usually what's caused us to search for answers and has ultimately landed us here in the first place). I feel as if all books should be taken with objective criticism, but this one really needs to be taken with a huge grain of salt. On another note, if any of you haven't red Rollo's ""The Rationale Male"", then I highly recommend it. If there was a ""RedPill Bible"" (for lack of a better phrase), this would be the book. The Manual was a worthwhile read as well. It was much more focused on game; unlike ""The Rationale Male"", not so much on how screwed-up women's (and feminized men's rationales) are. "
100,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Advanced Guide to Online Dating,53,4ye74d,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4ye74d/advanced_guide_to_online_dating/,2016-08-19 05:21:23,"**Intro** &amp;nbsp; Let us get something out of the way, every healthy twenty/thirty something year old likes to fuck, it is the reason we leave our house everyday - and those not doing it are looking for it. If thats not your dance or your song, you will find this post to be unrelatable. &amp;nbsp; If you live in a major city, enjoy meeting new girls and have some time to invest in the online pussy market, then online dating is a learnt tool and skillset which you must add to your arsenal. I have had plenty of success and plenty of failure, read my fair share of How Tos  went on one too many dates ending in blue balls, bedded my fair share of hot babes and had one too many blowjobs all from online dating. My phones have all been plagued with numbers I will never call, hundreds of them, the ones I fucked, the ones I didnt and the ones lost in abyss of nothingness where things that may or may not have happened. &amp;nbsp; The wall of text below is a comprehensive guide to online dating and it comes with a few words of caution Dont believe everything you read about online dating, especially those preaching it is easy as I have found that most of it is utter bullshit. &amp;nbsp; And &amp;nbsp; Be especially wary of confirmation bias, the Tinder subreddits are full of shitty examples, men sharing their shitty one liners for karma the one time it ever worked, and keeping their 45 failures to themselves. &amp;nbsp; **The Recipe for Online Pussy** &amp;nbsp; In order to prepare that online pussy a very specific recipe is required and the ingredients are as follows: &amp;nbsp; **1- Alpha** &amp;nbsp; **2- Game** &amp;nbsp; **3- Luck** &amp;nbsp; **4- Timing** &amp;nbsp; Good looks are the catalyst which allow these ingredients to mix and bake well  but they are NOT a primary ingredient as will be elaborated in detail (contrary to the POF/OKC study everyone loves to share.) For instance, with good looks men will get 20 matches rather than 2, but they do not change the game what so ever. &amp;nbsp; **1- Alpha ** be the king of your domain and impose your will on the world. Live, let live, and die. Be today, for you be a fossil 200,000 years from now where the world will be full of new life and new minds which are stressing about the stupid shit they did the night before. &amp;nbsp; **2- Game ** Have game, read this post, develop technique and acquire new pussy gathering skills, induce emotion in others. Enjoy or loathe yourself in the process &amp;nbsp; **3- Luck -** Accept the reality of life that no matter how many variables you control, there are others whose control is beyond your abilities. Dont rely on luck, a gazelle may wander off into the lions den, but if that is the lions only method of eating they will surely die from starvation. &amp;nbsp; **4- Timing ** Timing is everything - women are DTF and are in heat during different times of the month, and on other nights there is a code red. Some days you can get your dick wet by simply existing because you are at the right place at the right time, other days you will have to talk to 25 women before devouring fresh meat. &amp;nbsp; **Messaging** &amp;nbsp; **1- During the introduction stage, keep your mouth shut at all times.** &amp;nbsp; This one is very straight forward, without going in to details. Men think that online dating is their opportunity to show off their awesome hobbies, their awesome job title, so naturally during messaging and in their profiles they will continue to project their need for validation. Im sorry son, if you need someone to tell you how awesome your life is  call your mother  thats her job. As for the online babes, unless you are looking to fill the current vacancy for one needy beta Bob, learn to keep your mouth shut. If you must  disclose as little information as possible when the questions arise in the most natural nonchalant manner. &amp;nbsp; I avoid all of the shenanigans of who I am and what I do by lying through my fucking teeth. When asked I give whatever name I feel like giving and stick to a couple of online names to avoid having to catalogue what Ive said to whom. I provide made up job title, whatever ethnicity sounds cool at the time, one day I am a carpenter from Brazil, another I am a painter from Senegal, some days I pick fruit and sell it in the market  I am having tons of fun with things that dont fucking matter the least bit. &amp;nbsp; Dont expect women to fuck you because of your earnings, nor should you want to intrigue them to buy in to your life or ever track you down. As you will find, the best of dates have very little of what do you do? And where are you from? type of questions as the best dates are lived in the moment. **Like applying for a job - you are not selling yourself as a person, you are selling your skillset which in online dating is your demeanor, and your ability to fuck their brains out.** **2- Keep your motherfucking mouth shut about yourself, learn how to talk without saying anything** &amp;nbsp; This is so important that I broke it down to two points which you can ignore if you are looking for a pen pal, for online pussy, keep reading. &amp;nbsp; Humans have this incessant need to categorize one another and pigeonhole them in categories, aside from the fact that your body may be begging you for sex - curiosity is one of the major driving factors for you to meet someone new, and explore their naked body. So like a professional poker player, you must never flip your cards over until you see what is on the table. Never classify yourself. &amp;nbsp; The trick is to only disclose information you deem necessary (alpha male, chill person, not a threat) and allow their imagination to draw you into their most beautiful fantasy. &amp;nbsp; For women, ambiguity and vagueness spark interest, yet create an easy feeling of vulnerability which they ultimately succumb to when their eyes are rolled back (in-person). By talking about yourself, you facilitate the process of them categorizing you as a 35 year old divorced man or 22 year old biology student which not only puts you on the bus with thirty others who talk and walk just like you do, but its boring as fuck! &amp;nbsp; You want to know about Billy the biology students favorite sports and hobbies? No  no one gives a fuck. &amp;nbsp; You want to see that snap of Billy and Sam in the limo getting retarded on the way to the party? Why not  sounds interesting. &amp;nbsp; As you see, events and actions are exciting and incite emotions, while descriptions and the people involved are rather boring. It is not so much the activity in itself, it is that text messaging often betrays our ability invoke emotion that is in the moment where beginners resort to disclosing information about themselves in a failed effort to generate a spark. &amp;nbsp; **3- Plausible Deniability:** &amp;nbsp; Maintain plausible deniability at all times, you must allow the hamster to spin freely in your favor. You must leave enough room for her to lie to herself about how youre going to fuck her. Until my penis is thrusting inside her vagina I maintain plausible deniability at all times. &amp;nbsp; Never pin them into a corner where they are forced to lie to you and tell you how theyre not easy or not that type of girl, everything should be insinuated and understood so if her friends were to ask her how her night went she will be able to say We just texted a little bit, he was really nice, we met, he was cool, it was cold outside so we stopped by his place to get our jackets, and I unno... we just ended up fucking for the next few hours lol. It always just happened. Sending that text that reads I cant wait to fuck you even when both parties are on-board pins her into a corner where there is no way to rationalize what is going to happen but to think I am about to fuck a stranger from online based on pictures, Craigslist style  this is not something she can tell many people even if she is okay with it. Avoid sexting and dick pics under all conditions, if you want sex, get it in person. Do not give away the goods for free. &amp;nbsp; I cant emphasize this enough  **Game talk! she speaks it!**, and if she doesnt, shes not your type and may come at you with a rape accusation  stay the fuck away and run for your life. &amp;nbsp; **Examples of Game Talk:** &amp;nbsp; What you mean to say  Game Talk Translation I want to fuck you  Youre cute BTW! &amp;nbsp; I want to dominate you  I hope youre this much fun in person ;) &amp;nbsp; I have other options  Sorry, Ive been super busy  Busy day  Crazy night &amp;nbsp; I am the leader of men  How have the boys here been treating you? &amp;nbsp; I am above you  Haha! Thats cute ;) Why dont you (insert command) &amp;nbsp; I fuck like a beast  I just finished letting out some stress at the gym!  Just finished my jog at  &amp;nbsp; That is rude  (ignore) &amp;nbsp; Work for me  (space out texts) &amp;nbsp; You disgust me  1 word/1 letter answer &amp;nbsp; How goes the AF search?  Having much luck here? &amp;nbsp; Looking for AF, BB, or just going with the flow?  Didnt expect to see any cute girls here ;) &amp;nbsp; Once you get the yes which is never a yes immediately work the logistics, time and a place, the sooner the better. Try to keep all initial communication to 5 messages or less and logistics to a few messages. &amp;nbsp; A reciprocated compliment is a yes to meet, an inquiry or two is a yes to meet, :)/;)/hahaha/Okay! :) are half a yes, you get a couple and youre in the clear. &amp;nbsp; You have to also understand that it is not easy for women to say Come fuck me now albeit, it does happen, they will often resort to telling you about being in their bed at the moment, being tired, happy, stressed. Disclosing emotion to a stranger is their way of asking Here are my emotions - I would rather be in your frame &amp;nbsp; **4- Shit is happening, always:** &amp;nbsp; The world spins and clock goes tick-tock, it never stops. While you spend these 15 minutes reading, someone dies of hunger, another person buys their groceries, crimes are committed, someone seals the deal for a 4-some for the night while 2 others jerk it with force and vigor to remedy their depression and blue balls. You must learn to let go and dance to the rhythms which you compose using text, create the illusion of motion, while communicating, you are always on the go and shit is always happening  your words never go stale when you set them to motion. &amp;nbsp; **Paraphrasing:** What are you up to? Shit is happening! &amp;nbsp; How goes your week? Shit is happening! &amp;nbsp; How was your weekend? Shit was happening! &amp;nbsp; What are you doing later? Shit will be happening! &amp;nbsp; Any plans for the summer? I will make shit happen! &amp;nbsp; As soon as you pause to talk about yourself, motion stops, your messages lose all life and are left as motionless words on the screen. Remember that description of the painting you saw at your last visit to the museum? I dont either. How you felt, as you stood dazzled, and looked eye to eye with a beautiful piece of art  feelings resonate through time. &amp;nbsp; **5- Prove you have balls in person, dont posture, be extremely polite online:** &amp;nbsp; This one is counter intuitive, and is the one point where men need more practice. I owe most of my success in online dating to most other men being open about their dog status while online. Being aggressive and acting like an asshole to a female who you have never met while online, is the equivalent of someone telling you I will fuck you up if I ever see you over a screen. If you know this person and have met them before  it will mean something, however if someone were to tell you that on an online forum, it will be quickly dismissed as weak attempt that holds no merit and requires no courage  fortunately for you, your competition is doing just that and eliminating themselves in the process. In person, you have every right to be a bold tiger eyed sex machine who melts panties with one stare because that shows courage. When online, keep it classy. &amp;nbsp; Be extremely polite and playful, it will distinguish you from the pact. Dont confuse polite with beta. Polite means being classy and mannered even if politically incorrect and even if you use profanities  being overly direct, or mean is the most transparent way of letting these women know that you are a hopeless beta throwing inconsequential hail Marys online as a last resort. &amp;nbsp; **TEXTING/Messaging Techniques** &amp;nbsp; It baffles me how bad men are at texting women whom they dont know. Ironically, it is something that most women are good at. With you buddies you can say Wat u up 2 tmorow and they may even be alerted if you send a more formal Hey! Plans for the day? in the former, you are relaying a message in its simplest form, while in the latter you are proposing the start of an interaction which ends in someone letting go of all emotions, and having an orgasm with your penis inside of them  learn the distinction and act in accordance. &amp;nbsp; Exclamation marks, emojis, smiley faces, ellipsis, apostrophes, periods, strategically use them. They are part of online communication and are used to convey emotions over a text message. its 2016, unless you are a brick, dont be a brick. &amp;nbsp; **The Four Step Process to Texting:** &amp;nbsp; **Introduction  Dance just a little (in the moment)  Meet In-Person  Fuck (or not)** &amp;nbsp; Introductions are the social norm of greeting; they are your very first opportunity to use subtle communication to project value without saying anything. &amp;nbsp; At their essence introductions are our way of communicating I am civil, non-hostile, and I abide by social norms when meeting strangers. &amp;nbsp; There is nothing stopping you from greeting with Blowjob? ;) And I have opened with it (shitty success rate) many times, have received some numbers and just one lay. However, with practice  Ive decided to stick to practiced free throws and 3-pointers and avoid the full court one handed lobs. If the high-risk, high-reward quantity based method is what works best for you  then by all means  though I do not recommend it. &amp;nbsp; **Examples: ** &amp;nbsp; *Introduction 1: Plain &amp;nbsp; You: Hey! &amp;nbsp; Her: Hi :) &amp;nbsp; You: Hows it going? &amp;nbsp; Her: Im good and you? :) &amp;nbsp; Thats it, easy, no bullshit, dont qualify yourself. Correct spelling is like good posture, ! show high energy and enthusiasm, :) show cheerfulness. If youve taken the time to read their profile then youve already bought into their frame, forget their profile and also forget their Instagram, youre not looking for a wife. &amp;nbsp; *Introduction2: &amp;nbsp; You: Hey hey! &amp;nbsp; Her: Hey hey hey! &amp;nbsp; Shes dancing your dance, play time &amp;nbsp; You: Well arent you a sassy little thing! ;) &amp;nbsp; Her: Haha! Im actually the conservative type *Pause* &amp;nbsp; Shes inviting you into her frame, Im a sassy little bitch, I bring all of the boys to the yard and youre one of them &amp;nbsp; Whenever I am ever invited into a womans frame I put her on a time-out for a few hours and come back and take charge of the conversation when I feel like it. **Put this one on a time-out for a few hours** &amp;nbsp; You: Haha! Guess looks are deceiving (you came back some hours later, you are compelled to reference what they have last said without actually giving a fuck about it as a social formality, she knows this, now, back to your frame) Anything fun and exciting for tonight? :) &amp;nbsp; *Introduction 3  Roll into Dance: &amp;nbsp; You: Hey you :) &amp;nbsp; Her: Hi &amp;nbsp; You: How are you? / Hows it going? / Hows your day? &amp;nbsp; Her: I just did (insert text), what about you? &amp;nbsp; You: Long day! Just finished at the gym  off to the shower then to will have to see what the night holds ;) Having much fun here? &amp;nbsp; Her: Its okay/Sigh, no comment / So many messages, lol/ Guys are animals/Just trying this out &amp;nbsp; If the answer is complemented by an inquiry of her own, roll with the punches and covertly tell her that you want to fuck her, via compliment, teasing, etc. If the answer yields a lull, make a general statement, then follow up with your intentions to fuck her &amp;nbsp; You: lol! The fish are not behaving Youre cute BTW! :) &amp;nbsp; Its much like sex start slow (intro)  get faster (a little more rapport)  build/provide energy (shit is happening)  Get them charged up (women get very talkative)  Get energy (Get them curious, they will be on the chase)  Finish with boldness (seal the deal, get the date) &amp;nbsp; **Additional Tips:** &amp;nbsp; Be fluid like water, then penetrate like ice. If you have something specific which you are looking for or a specific type of girl, then go in head first and execute. At times I will let a woman take charge, answer questions while being mildly playful, do nothing but dodge jabs, and some hours later shes riding me like a sex starved maniac. While dominant by nature, I am willing to temporarily compromise my dominant position to get in, and I proceed to dominate afterwards in future interactions with new leverage (dick). &amp;nbsp; Avoid 25-29 year olds like the plague, they are best mated with a helpless beta and are most often a complete waste of time. The 24 and under still have life in them, and the 30+ crowd have come to accept the terms of life, while they will still try to tame you and pin you down - when push comes to shove - they have a better understanding of their bargaining position and will usually accept a dicking over nothing at all. &amp;nbsp; **Profile/Pictures:** &amp;nbsp; Picture are a point of importance which stop 90% of men from entering the online sex market. In addition to 50+ online girls in the past year, what inspired me to put this together is seeing the market place from a womans perspective time and time again while browsing their dating apps. As I lay in bed a repeat customer (HB10) who I had met from OKC, I decide that she shall not get her morning round until I had fun with her phone which was beeping earlier creating somewhat of an annoyance. Open the OkCupid application, lo and behold  I am greeted by 1000+ visitors, and 100+ unread messages from the previous couple of days. As her status was changed to online the messages started coming in at a rapid rate (this is at 7AM on the weekend) every beta Bob who did not get laid the night prior was mass sending Heys and His in the most gruesome manner. Out of the 100+ messages received, no more than 10 were opened and a total of 3 received a response. The 20x20 pixel message avatar of the other 90% of men was enough to deem them virtually invisible. But I dont blame her, the pictures we so bad they could have comprised page #25 of a high school yearbook. Take better pictures! &amp;nbsp; The three men were me, my pictures make me out to be a super tall 10 with my best most natural smile captured and muscles showing (not actually a 10), and another man who looked like a Calvin Klein underwear model (shirtless photo) and one other. &amp;nbsp; Mr. CK was eliminated due to being too needy in messages, and the other was far too aggressive. Leaving me to be the winner by default. &amp;nbsp; **The picture experiment:** &amp;nbsp; While travelling South America earlier this summer I had many pictures taken of me. On one specific day I walked through a park in the Amazon for hours with a HB7 I met at the resort where we took hundreds of pictures and while browsing through them the next day I found the one that best highlighted my features. In two similar instances I had two others taken of me, these pictures have worked wonderfully for online dating, but I tried something different. &amp;nbsp; As an experiment I added a fourth picture to my profiles which was with messy hair, bad lighting, and a horrible angle in front of a squat rack. This was the equivalent of infecting my profiles with a virus as my response rate dropped by a whooping 90% with just one bad picture. Messaging on POF/OKC with great pictures works like clockwork, send a message, so-and-so has views your profile, 10 seconds later a response is received. This is because there are substantially more males than females on these websites, not to mention that many of the females are of an undesirable age group, creating a higher demand on the 18-24 year old good looking female demographic (100s:1). This partially re-affirms the studies showing that websites such as POF and OKC are looks based, but theres a catch  it was not so much that 90 out of 100 men are ugly, it was because their pictures sucked, a lot! &amp;nbsp; Women know how to take great pictures and spend hours a day making themselves look good. Men on the other hand, fail to take good pictures in the one arena where pictures matter the most. As in my scenario, have good pictures taken, photography is an art and can make a 4 look like 6-7, or a 7-8 look like 10. Fitness alone allows most men to take jaw dropping pictures that melt panties. &amp;nbsp; On Tinder/Bumble the ball game is slightly different. Women choose who they talk to at their own discretion. When a woman has to filter through 100 men who have all messaged her, she doesnt have the time to read profiles, find the interesting ones and talk to them hoping something will materialize  she will choose the 10 which she believes are best looking and try to find the AF in between. Tinder is more forgiving for less dazzling men, as they can take pictures which are interesting and get plenty of matches. An example of an interesting picture is cruising down the street on a bicycle with both feet on the seat, augmented with a big carefree smile, performing on a stage, doing something funny with a pet, being awarded a black belt at a martial arts competition. With tinder and bumble, it is possible to spark interest and distinguish yourself from the pact without relying heavily on appearance. &amp;nbsp; Referring back to pictures not being a primary ingredient how it works is as follows: &amp;nbsp; Great Pictures = Lots of Matches (almost all of them) &amp;nbsp; Mediocre Pictures = Some Matches (5-10%) &amp;nbsp; Bad Pictures = No Matches &amp;nbsp; While I heavily emphasize having great pictures, even a hit rate of 5-10% every man can get at least 50-100 matches/messages in a major city, and I have seen the ugliest of men score big on Tinder through the numbers game. &amp;nbsp; No Game: It does not matter how great your pictures are, you are relying strictly on luck, and very little will materialize into a bang. The worst part is that it is nearly impossible to understand your failures without outside intervention &amp;nbsp; Mediocre Game: The number of dates will be directly proportional to your match count, however, very few of those dates will materialize into lays. Many would call those dates a waste of time, you can take it as a learning process and accept your failures. &amp;nbsp; Great Game: The number of dates will be directly proportional to your match count; most dates should materialize into a lay/plate. &amp;nbsp; With online dating having sub-optimal pictures is the equivalent of shooting darts from twice the distance. While having no game is like shooting in the opposite direction. &amp;nbsp; **Conclusion:** &amp;nbsp; Online dating is salesmanship, you must put in time and work to get better at it, internalize what others tell you but ultimately develop your own approach. Much like making a sale, you first generate leads and the numbers start flowing in, you arrange deals (dates), some come through and some fail. It is a skill acquired only through practice. Many argue that online dating is a cess pool, and I agree that the quality is diluted by the entirety of the bottom half of the barrel being there. In far too many instances it can be gratifying, entertaining and fun to play with (and sex of course). &amp;nbsp; Online dating is hard for men because it is so easy for anyone to enter, to be the top 5-10% you must get good. The silver lining is that your competition is awful, obnoxious, and defeated for the most part. Final disclaimer: If you have walked up to a woman in the street, greeted her, and asked her out  you have already proven that you have balls and dont shy away. The same cannot be said about an arranged online date, be bold, and dont skip the part where you stick your neck out there and go for the kill, just as you would have done in person. &amp;nbsp; **-JesusTheThird** "
101,vulnerability,TheRedPill,The Feminine Coup de Grce - Why she chooses the worst possible moment to leave you.,424,4mxm6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4mxm6a/the_feminine_coup_de_grâce_why_she_chooses_the/,2016-06-07 15:59:12,"**Summary: While showing vulnerability in the face of hardship alerts a woman that there might be cause to leave you, she is more likely to sever ties if that weakness manifests into fear of losing her. It is in a womans best interest to end her sexual relationship with you at the worst possible moment. Women test men at every given opportunity, and by timing her exit when you are at your weakest she is given one final opportunity to see whether or not you are a man.** * * * **Body:** Now we can argue this situation does not bear discussing; that if a relationship reaches this stage it is irrevocably damaged youve shown weakness and thats unattractive. In fact, we know she probably decided to leave you long before shed even verbalised it. In addition, relationships are not important when you have abundance mentality. So why should we bother to talk about it? Well, a womans motivations at this time touch on some important theories that underpin key operations of the female mind and discussion may resonate with a confused and angry man, dumped just last week, who lands on the TRP homepage, much as it did for me when I came here a little over a year ago welcome to the sub Mr. Depp. &amp;nbsp; **coup de grce** (koo d grs) n. pl. **coups de grce** (koo) 1. A deathblow delivered to end the misery of a mortally wounded victim. 2. A finishing stroke or decisive event. &amp;nbsp; How many times do we see this? A guy whose woman, from new squeeze to forever person, dumps him the night before his final exam, when he gets ill, when he loses his job, when a member of his family dies, etc... All too often. Subconsciously or not, she chooses to end it at the worst timing for him because that is **when it is most efficacious for her.** It is a final test to see if her leaving you when you are already vulnerable will break you entirely, which for the unsuspecting it usually does and she has her answer you were not a man in the first place. &amp;nbsp; Under Briffaults Law a woman will sever a relationship that is/was sexual with you for two primary reasons: 1. She has found a better branch to swing to (Chad), and, 2. Having initially had an abundance of attractive qualities, you have surpassed her tolerable threshold of failed shit tests and she sees you as sexually repulsive (beta). &amp;nbsp; Once this stage in the battle to keep a relationship has been reached and a woman announces her desire to end it she already has you on the ropes and is looking to deliver her knockout blow, her coup de grce that one final hit to your manhood to give her **enough cause to disassociate from you entirely.** &amp;nbsp; Shes likely been preparing herself for this for some time, enough time to ensure her transition out is in a manner **least painful to her and most painful to you.** To us men it sounds fucking evil and calculative, and it certainly is. But stop for a minute and ask why is she so cruel, surely she wouldnt do it **on purpose?** Fact of the matter is she would, and for good reason. For starters she cant resist. In a covert contract from her perspective, you sold yourself as an unbreakable man when she agreed to go exclusive with you and now shes found a chink in your armour, she can't wait to see if youll dishonour this. Secondly she resents you; youve just made her job harder. Youve potentially hoodwinked her into thinking you were an alpha and you have wasted precious time in the finite window of her youthfulness and attractiveness that she has to secure a true alpha. If she already has a better option lined up (Chad), she wants to hit you even harder, hoping youll beg her to stay, plead her to reconsider, or get mad, meaning you lack abundance mentality, have weak frame, and are devoid of outcome independence all of which signals to her that you are not in fact alpha or even the prize. This too comes with the added bonus for her of **the relationship failing at *your* hands**, absolving herself of all guilt and responsibility, as is her modus operandi. &amp;nbsp; But why resort to this final act of brutality when signs of weakness have likely gone unpunished before? It serves her better to launch it as a surprise. Instinctively she knows her grasp on reality isnt totally trustworthy, that it is made up from a cataclysmic barrage of nonsensical inputs such as the hivemind, what she perceives are other peoples perceptions, passed and failed shit-tests, solopsism what she **needs is undeniable proof that she is not attracted to you and that she wont regret letting you go.** It need not be based in rationality, it just needs to *feel* like it is irrefutable. So she goes for the killer blow the minute your guard drops. Were she to try to dump you when youre on cloud nine for whatever reason her reality test results would come back, well clouded. But if she goes for the kill when your defences are down and it drops you, well then the results are definitive (in her mind) youre a beta pal. &amp;nbsp; What we need to take away from this is that if your relationship has reached this point you have likely already lost the fight on points. But she wont *feel* like she has won and gained closure unless you hit the canvas knocked out cold. Women love closure because it *feels* irrefutable. &amp;nbsp; The Francophiles and etymologists out there will already know that the literal translation of coup de grce into English is blow of mercy. **Mercy can only be given by those with power, and if a woman has power over you, youre done.** &amp;nbsp; Best course of action when you end up here? Dodge the next attack, pick yourself off the deck, laugh at her childlike attempts hurt you and walk from the ring like it is nothing (which it is). Leave her wondering, What the fuck is this man made of? I had him at my **mercy** and it hasnt affected him at all. Could I be wrong about him? &amp;nbsp; And remember, a man who can survive hardship, illness, unemployment, tragedy, injustice but not a break-up is weak; but a man who can survive all that and brush off a break-up like it is nothing is actually one hell of a man. * * * **Lessons Learned:** -Struggling with life does not necessarily prove you are not alpha, but it certainly alerts her to the fact you might not be. -She will always test you; harder when she sniffs out beta traits; hardest when you are at your most vulnerable. -Women rely on many irrational premises to form their reality. Take advantage of this. -At times you are feeling weak (Life can do this to you and you wont always be able to hide it), soldier on and never show weakness **for** her. -Hold frame. Have abundance. Be outcome independent. If she goes for the coup de grce when youre under pressure tell her whatever youve got more important things to worry about and you do."

Nothing new I can really add that benefits any of you specifically and nothing you havent come across before suffice to say yet another example of what you guys call AWALT and what I call being a cunt. Loads of below average posts on here, perhaps this is one of them and loads of understandably angry people but also some insightful gems by some very intelligent, wordy and gifted writers so thanks for spreading the seeds. Nearly forty years old, kids, married, divorcing actually with an extremely high probability of being fisted which is akin to being shafted but worse, much worse. The sad thing is that a 70/30 split of all assets in her favour Im looking at as a positive outcome, how does that work? EVERYTHING that I worked hard and paid for and Im *happy* with anything that equates to or is better than 70/30! Met at eighteen, instantly realised it was ever so slightly emotionally retarded but within two months she was pregnant. Of course this happened purely by accident and not in any way because I was a ripped magnet who didnt give a fuck about much and was just passing through. BP conditioning led me to believe that I had to do the right thing, that I wouldnt do what my father did and be an abandoner, that I would be a good man and not allow a broken family to be created. None of this was conscious I might add, this was unconscious, programmed behaviour that had been ingrained from an early age. I settled, it didnt matter that I knew it wasnt right because she loved me, I was the boss, I called the shots and I was the one on the pedestal. Add that to the fact that I had/have insecurities and she was the right fit at the right time. At the time I had no real sense of direction, no self awareness and certainly no masculine role models to provide me with the direction and advice that I needed but the mother of my child idolised me and I now had responsibilities, I fell straight into family mode and if Im honest I liked it, I felt it gave me a sense of purpose. Its a very empowering position to be in when someone looks to you for pretty much everything, who asks for guidance, who asks if its ok to do XYZ, who asks your opinion on pretty much every aspect of their life. At least I thought it was empowering although thats perhaps not quite what it is. Fast forward a few years and I manage to get a decent job, to buy my first house and to have a relatively stable family life, all by the age of 22. For a guy who fucked up at school and left with no qualifications, had a dysfunctional home life and had no real guidance in life this was a pretty good situation to be in, I thought. Fast forward a few more years and I gained a university degree, another child, climbed the corporate ladder and got married. I thought why not, she proposed to me, Im special, she idolises me, we have children and it seemed like the right thing to do. Tellingly this all came about after our worst period together with me ready to leave, funny that, one minute Im leaving and the next Im getting married. Makes perfect sense...not! Back then we just about had the Internet let alone TRP or the like to provide guidance on these topics so Im not going to blame myself too much. Although she was emotional she was a pretty good wife and mother, cooked, cleaned, looked after the kids, deferred (pretty much most of the time) to my actions/opinions/logic not because I was controlling but because I was generally right. Sex started to become more infrequent but I thought this was normal, this is what happens. I wasnt happy with it, it caused arguments but I had grown to love her in a sense over the years or maybe it was attachment, I dont know. Plus I was still the man of the house and she still idolised me - cards, presents, notes, declarations of love nearly every day and displays of insecurity. Yep, insecurity, I actually thought that her insecurity meant that in some way this meant she loved me unconditionally, that I was so awesome she could not function without me. I was wrong but more on that later... I managed to keep my shit together pretty consistently for the best part of fifteen years, dealt with pretty much everything that came up, took care of my shit and took care of my familys shit. However during year fourteen I didnt keep my shit together. I started to feel low, I felt anxious, I felt unhappy, I started to feel a bit insecure and in my own time, when no-one was around I started to get teary. What was happening, why the fuck did I feel like this, why couldnt I shake it. I was a man who had managed to deal with lifes adversities since a pretty young age and here I was locked in the bathroom cryingfor no discernable reason. I felt ashamed and of course this just fuelled my feelings further. I went to see the doctor and they gave me pills, I took 3 or 4, felt like shit and flushed them away. I checked the Internet for advice and this is when I realised I had become depressed, I had become hopeless and helpless, two fundamental aspects of depression. I confided in my mother (awesome person by the way, best friend and yes  the only woman (unless youre also lucky to have a daughter) who loves you for you)). Shes a tough woman whos had a tough life and didnt really understand how I felt but tried her best to help. I also confided in my wife but she couldnt really help either and this may sound weird but it seemed like she enjoyed the shift in the power dynamics, this was very subtle of course. As I said I checked the Internet and found that there were some methods that I could use to help me, I started to keep fit, I tried meditation. I read a book called the road less travelled, the first of many subsequent self-help books that I have read over the years. I remember one part of the book recommending that people use therapy to help and/or enlighten themselves, not just people with issues but the author felt that all people could benefit from therapy and although this was an unmanly thing to do I sought out the help of a therapist. There was a lot of off loading on my part, some stuff back from the therapist about childhood experiences, the abuse from step father  calm down you sick fucks I wasnt tampered with in any way  purely psychological with no and I mean not one display of positive emotion towards me. Although I understand and have done for a good few years that this wasnt his fault, he was incapable of being a good father let alone a good step father and I hold no malice towards him. Therapy didnt provide any light bulb moments or epiphanies but one thing that did lead indirectly from it was getting in contact with my absent father. I wont bog down this post with the details but that turned out to be a good thing, it still is a good thing and I have a good extended family that I didnt have before. However, the reality is you dont claim back 30+ yrs of a lost father/son relationship, it just doesnt happen, not in my case anyway but its good none the less. I concluded the therapy after about a year, it became expensive and I had pretty much offloaded everything in me so didnt feel there was any more benefit to it. Anyway, I digress It was around this time that my wife started to spend a lot of time at her friends house, the friend was a bit trashy, single mother, not a nasty person, just not my cup of tea although I can find common ground and converse with most people so not a problem. I helped out the friend sometimes financially because this was what good men do. I started to also become aware that my wife was spending an inordinate amount of time there. Her friend had children, one of them a young lad pretty much the same age as my boy and I remember becoming more and more uncomfortable and allowing insecure thoughts to enter my mind. I found it hard to confront her with this issue without looking like a paranoid pussy and let things build up. I eventually showed my vulnerability and said I felt uncomfortable with how much time she was spending there, especially with a group of teenage boys around. Of course I was being ridiculous, paranoid and what I was inferring was sick. I felt a bit ashamed to be honest so I accepted the situation and suffered in silence. A few months later and she had become totally distant, was going out all the time and showed minimal affection. I wanted to discuss us but she wouldnt talk, she just kept saying she wasnt happy. I panicked inside because the woman I had married and the mother of my children was treating me like she had never done before, it fucking hurt man. A couple of good friends asked if she was being unfaithful about but I said no, its not in her nature, shes just fallen out of love with me. I spoke to my mother who also said she wouldnt do that, its just not in her nature. Im not a snooper by nature but I went into full PI mode, I knew something was wrong but I either didnt understand the extent of it or chose not to acknowledge what was blatantly staring me in the face. I found numerous calls and texts in the space of a few months to an unknown number... Right up until the day she told me I didnt believe it although I knew all along if that makes sense, I just ignored my gut. Guys, never ignore your gut, understand that there is a difference between insecure thoughts and intuitive thoughts. Ive read somewhere that if there is emotion/anxiety attached to a thought then it comes from a place of insecurity (this doesnt mean that its wrong, just that its from an insecure place) and if the thoughts are from a calm, well thought out logical place then this is intuitive. Intuition is rarely wrong, listen to it, do not fucking ignore it, ever. Your intuition will be right more than it is wrong, trust me. Where was I, oh yeah, she told me she loved me but she wasnt in love with me and that she was in love with her friends son, eighteen years old. Eighteen fucking years old and she was in love with him. The emotional/mental pain was so acute and stressful that it caused me to shit rabbit pellets for a few days, I shit you not (no pun intended). Not only did I have to deal with her betrayal I also had to deal with utter humiliation right on my doorstep, the loss of my family, the loss of my home, the loss of my and for good measure I had to deal with repressed abandonment issues, sound good? It wasnt, it was shit. Im not a cryer but I cried...hard. It was the most traumatic psychological experience I have ever had the displeasure to be exposed to. But hold on, how fucked up is this, I actually felt more attracted to her now that she didnt want me. I tried reasoning with her, our beautiful family, our lives when we got older, our grandchildren and the good life we would have, all of it fell on deaf ears. I left, I had no choice and her behaviour had started to become abusive and she exhibited signs of BPD. I had to move into a shitty room for a few months till I found somewhere reasonable. I distanced myself and tried to pick up the pieces of the only way of life I had known since I was eighteen years old, I was now thirty five. I felt like shit but funnily enough I also felt lighter, like a burden had been lifted. I can only put this down to the realisation that I wasnt going mad, that all of my thoughts and feelings had been spot on, I just hadnt trusted myself enough. I didnt feel depressed but my confidence was at an all time low. However, I got a little bit of attention from a woman I knew. I thought she was a nice girl, very plain, intelligent, responsible etc... it turned out that she was a total slut (in a good way, Im not judging) and exactly what I needed at the time so I started fucking her, lots. I didnt care about her but she was a nice to me, she loved cock and loved being fucked hard, so I duly obliged. The more I distanced myself from my wife the more she pursued me and eventually I fucked her as well, the sex was good, the best it ever had been so I continued. We fucked every day for a few months, sometimes a few times a day, it was crazy. It was also toxic and damaging to my children and Im not happy with myself that I didnt do what was best for them. Your childrens (if youre lucky to have them) emotional health is their most important attribute, dont ever forget this, do not damage you child more than they already have been in instances such as this. I digress again... We continued in this state of limbo for a few months with no real resolution or forward movement  toxicity, passion, dysfunction, dishonesty  rinse and repeat. There were more lies, she was still in contact with him after she had sworn on our childrens lives that she wasnt. I dont know about you guys and Im not saying Im the most honest person in the world but fuck swearing on your childrens lives, thats some sociopathic shit. It turned out she had been dishonest all along. I could say that this brought more pain but I was already in a perpetual and sustained state of pain so it just joined the queue. Im conscious Ive used up my TRP credit for today so Ill stop now, all the interesting bits come after and Ill happily continue if theres an appetite for it from you guys. Thanks for reading. Lessons learned so far: Dont let women with very clear emotional problems into your life, note  most if not all women have emotional problems but filter out the ones that would register on the DSM scale Put your coat on, dont fuck without it Your perception is your reality, ingrain this concept, reframe shit Dont ruminate, get a grip of your mind when it hamsters, it can be done If you feel depressed, fuck medication...where possible, unless you feel suicidal then do what you need to do Meditate to calm your monkey Exercise to release the good shit Increase your knowledge by reading and understanding the content, read good shit Dont ignore your gut, if you feel somethings off youre generally right Walk away if she betrays you, gather your senses Dont try to fix it if it breaks, some men can do this, I take my hat off to their powers of forgiveness but most cant. I certainly cant Reduce your fuck giving, realise that life can be real shit, adapt to that state of mind Cultivate sexual opportunities quickly if you want to, you dont have to heal Go monk mode if thats your cup of tea In the grand scheme of things you mean fuck all, to you however youre priceless, realise this, internalise this And dont get married. Just dont "

Trying to rationalise the whys and hows of a failed relationship is a fruitless waste of time and emotional energy, time and energy that can be spent on more positive experiences. Anyway back to the matter at hand As I said, after she told me I moved out, however within a couple of days I had calls saying I needed to go back as my boys were in pieces emotionally, I needed to be there for them irrespective of what I was going through. The simple fact is that at the time she abandoned her children, her emotions were wrapped up elsewhere and when her children needed her most she was absent and not much has changed since. Whilst I was away my eldest had self harmed, not badly so I wont labour the point but the resultant detail is not the issue, its the fact that he even attempted it in the first place. He had never done anything like this before (or since) and I can only imagine the pain he felt; actually I can emphatically imagine the pain he felt, I felt it too. Her reaction when we both found out? To go out that very same night to a party with her new *partner*. I spent the night sitting on the sofa with a blanket cuddling my son telling him everything was going to be ok. Can you imagine that guys, especially the fathers amongst you? Youre first born son cutting himself because he is in so much emotional pain. As I recount these memories and write this my eyes are starting to sting. Its one thing having to deal with shit yourself but watching your child suffer psychological trauma is a next level of fucked upness. When I look back I still cant understand how my brain was functioning at the time, I was putting up with things that I never in a million years thought Id put up with and Im really not that guy, or at least I think Im not that guy, perhaps I was, what a sobering truth to have to deal with. In reality I just didnt know how to deal with the situation, I had no point of reference, no experience to draw on, I was on auto pilot for day to day stuff  work, interacting with people, being a father  but I struggled to process the events that had just happened. I can only imagine that this was some form of temporary insanity but Im not here to judge myself, Ive already done that, Im just here to tell you guys the story. Within a couple of weeks I knew I needed to leave permanently, I had a rainy day stash of money and thank fuck I did. Some advice, always have a couple of thousand at least stashed should you need it. Anyway, things were escalating at home and becoming abusive physically (thats her to me just in case you thought otherwise), how I managed to keep my composure then and for the next few months was truly astonishing. You frequently read about men losing their shit in these types of situations and I really do not understand how the fuck a woman can so readily incite a man to violence. I actually saw something on the news today, a woman was slapping, punching, kicking her, Im guessing, boyfriend. He absorbed this for a number of minutes then snapped and punched her a few times, she was knocked out cold. Ive got to admit seeing a man flip on a woman like was just seemed wrong. You can argue that maybe she was provoking but the violence he visited was primal. Im just glad I kept my shit together throughout all of this when the provocation was super intense, real glad. Initially I still wanted to put my family back together, that was all I could think of and I had read how marriages can be salvaged, that they can be better than before and a small part of me believed this. Id like to think Im a decent person generally, Im liked *and* respected by pretty much everybody I know. Ill call people out on their shit if I need to, Ill empathize when I feel its the right thing to do but all in all a straight up guy. However, I can also be a vengeful cunt and this is what I became after all that I had gone through. As I said I was still fucking the ex but my confidence was still at an all time low and on a random day out and not even particularly looking ( I say not particularly but I do always appreciate a good looking woman ) I met another girl. She happened to be 10 yrs younger than me and there was clearly an attraction between us. It wasnt long before I had her in my bed... and my kitchen and sofa and on the stairs for that matter, you get the point. I did this (her) for a few months, fucking both of them, it was actually exhausting but I didnt really care, not too much about the girl and certainly not about my ex. As with most things though the truth will out and when my ex found out she flipped and started on a path of self harm that was to last for a number of months. Arguments would happen and she would punch herself, pull her hair out, put a knife up to her throat, swallow pills, head-butt the mirror and say she would tell the police it was me, prevent me from leaving and threaten suicide. A few of these events even happened in front of my eldest which Im sure will scar him for life. Surely she had gone mad, she had caused of all of this and was now acting like the victim. BPD much?? As I write this Ive just remembered something that happened the day she found out and Im actually smiling at the irony of it. If you want a pure and unequivocal example of RP logic then hows this? The day she found out she fucked me like a woman possessed, where she should (logically) have distanced herself from me, told me to fuck off or what have you she *chose* to fuck me instead...chuckle... The marriage was dead, dead beyond repair but I/we held it together for a few weeks more. There was no trust, no respect, no like, not much love but there was still attraction, weird huh! As I said previously I had gone full PI mode and part of this consisted of putting a spy app on her phone. Disclaimer** I have a responsibility to say that it is wrong, very wrong to invade someones privacy in such a manner and you should not do it. In all seriousness you can be faced with legal ramifications so be very, very careful. I personally think if youre in the position where you feel the need to spy on someone then more often than not somethings up and you probably shouldnt be associated with this person anyway. Or you could just be a fucking paranoid psycho, neither one being a particularly productive outcome for your mental health. Anyway, I did do this and it was very revealing to say the least, tracking, messages, calls, conversations, microphone, you get the picture it was pretty state of the art. Without going into too much detail there was more dishonesty, not affair related as such but Id had my fill. This is when the shutters came down for me, my light bulb moment. She cried, she begged, she tried to manipulate, she tried to bribe, she tried everything she possibly could but any feelings I had had perished, I was truly indifferent. I felt nothing for her, actually thats not quite true, I felt sorry for her. I pitied her. I accepted the situation, I had already moved on during the time we had spent together so although it was still painful it was easier to deal with. I realise now how sick all of this was, not just her but the part I played as well, I should have left on day 1 and never looked back but I guess I had to learn the hard way. One good point, actually the only good point for re-trying, was that I will never, ever have any regrets, no looking back thinking what if? I dont know anyone who would have done the same. Not that Im proud of this because it just goes to show how much of a cunt I was for entertaining it. But I did try and no regrets will ever be had. I learnt so many *lessons* about women after my separation. I tried to understand where I had gone wrong in this, what had happened. I read on some popular websites about how communicating is what makes relationships work, make her feel special, treat her right, tell her you love her, demonstrate your actions, treat your woman with more consideration, dont be controlling, dont be so dominant, demonstrate equality, use the languages of love, blah blah blah. Complete and utter bollocks, all of it. Ill tell you why I had a successful relationship for a number of years until it imploded. I was the captain, I called the shots, I kept my emotions in check and I called her out on her shit when I needed to, she was the child and I treated her like the child from the beginning. When I displayed weakness, when I showed my vulnerabilities, when I tried to use reason and logic, when I was no longer the *captain* I was fucked. Take heed of this guys, its sad. Sad that you cannot rely on your partner/wife/LTR/plate whatever the fuck your dynamic is. You cannot truly rely on them. This RP shit is hard man, to know that I have no-one, no-one but me to rely on, no woman and for that matter no man to ever lean on for help, to never be able to completely let go and trust. But as hard as it is it is also the truth and that can be inspiring. To a greater extent you are in control of your destiny. Your happiness is your response ability. Unfortunately I entered into another LTR some months after. I say unfortunately as I entered it before I had had a chance to find out about the red pill and its concepts. Although its a totally different dynamic to my last one I started the LTR badly in terms of trying to treat her right, treating her with equality, being romantic, being tolerant, all the stuff I thought I needed to and all of the stuff I had *learnt* but it doesnt work like that guys. Ive spent months trying to undo what Ive done and it is indeed easier and I would advise the best course of action to start off your relationships (if you want them) in RP mode. Alpha with a sprinkling of beta. The shit tests have lessened, there is more respect there, there is still attraction and Ive shifted the dynamics towards me... for now. Its only a matter of time though before things go South. Im aware of this, Im aware of her hypergamous nature and Im ok with that. I wont marry, no more kids, no living together and I sometimes plate which perhaps dilutes my affection but the affection is still there nonetheless. Not sure how you reduce it further though. Whats missing in my life now? I look good, actually I look very good (for now), good genes, I lift, relatively good body even before lifting, better because of it. I never got fat, I dress well, Im athletically fit, I have pursuits that I actually pursue, I study, I travel, I meditate... but not enough, I educate myself. I have a good job with a pretty good salary, Im pretty much an expert in my field and can double my income if I choose to work for myself (which is one of many options that Ive explored). I have good social skills and can slide up and down the scale when conversing with people. Im good with women, Ive never been a pursuer though so my approach game is non-existent, something to work on I guess. People see a cool, confident, fit, intelligent guy in front of them and most of the time this is how I feel. Itd be good to feel like that all the time. After I get divorce raped I *hope* be able to get back on track financially but I am still missing one key ingredient. I miss deep, strong, male relationships... Fuck off you faggots, I dont mean like that. I have mates that I can play football with, go to the gym with, drink with, have camaraderie with but I only have a couple of close friends and these are geographically remote. Im a lone wolf, thats my modus operandi, Im good with that, Im comfortable being alone but I would like more of these types of male relationships although I dont yet know how to cultivate them. One of the *many* important lessons I took from all of this was the importance of yours and if you have them your childrens emotional health. Its vital and is up to you to look after this aspect. I came out of this better than I went in but I shouldnt have put myself through this in the first place. I never will again thats for sure. As for my children yes they have been affected, theyve been scarred but theyre ok. Lessons learnt:  At the first sign of crazy run  Dont fuck crazy  Educate yourself  Improve your career  Stash rainy day money  Never show weakness  Use your intuition, act on it  Think of your mental health  Process your pain  Think of your childrens mental health  Never flip out physically  If you LTR, vet thoroughly  Apply RP philosophy from the start of a potential LTR, alpha with a sprinkling of beta  Have goals, work towards them  Lift  Expand your horizons  Cultivate male bonds  Dont fucking get married Thanks "
104,vulnerability,TheRedPill,On Frame and Reframing,20,4gqyx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4gqyx0/on_frame_and_reframing/,2016-04-28 08:23:39,"**Summary:** Using anecdotal examples, we examine frame and reframing and why the concept is so central to social interaction, in particular inter-gender relationships. **Body:** There are countless versions of what Frame means and how you Frame or Reframe. We can have an endless argument about this in the comments but that's not really the point here. In order to discuss the topic in any semblance of depth however, we have to agree on one definition. Let's use mine because it's not official and anyone who disagrees with how I view Frame can write it off as my personal misconception. #Perception of Frame ---- First, I acknowledge everyone has frame. Some are good and solid; unshakable points of view that can weather any storm. Others are fragile, easily broken by words or actions. Some frames are consistent and omnipresent. Others shift focus and strength. Some frames are immutable. Others constantly change their form. Frame, to me, is a simplified way of saying: Does this person have their mental shit together? If a person does not, they have bad frame. If they do, they have good frame. However, the question isn't one you can pose only once and get a straight answer. Remember, not all frame is equal, and it can shift over time, for example via a reframe. We'll talk about that later, but it's an important distinction to make. Let's examine an anecdote that shows how frame can shift: &gt; I drop by my Bob's office, my immediate superior. He grumbles about a badly performing employee for several minutes before I make it known that I require a costly piece of software to finish my assignment. I acknowledge Bob's authority and implicitly admit my inferior status within the organizational hierarchy before I make my request. Throughout Bob's rant, I keep my goal in mind but do not assert it as that would disrespect his seniority. My original intentions remain hidden, and I reveal them only when I take control of the conversation. This is an example of two frames and one reframe. In this situation, as is the case in inter-gender dynamics and in every other conversation you will ever have, the frames are not equal. Bob and I cannot go head to head on equal footing because we are not equal for a number of reasons. I cannot simply walk up to Bob and assert my frame. It's social suicide, impractical, and disrespectful. The reason I use this example (we'll get to women later) is because it's between to vasty different male frames. It's also a good example of how frame isn't a simple concept. Following the anecdote related, Bob tried to regain frame by arguing I didn't absolutely need the software, and it was a valid argument. I countered with a slightly illogical but relevant argument that the tools I had at my disposal were insufficient (they were actually just impractical and Bob probably knew that). Shortly after he agreed, grumbling about the other employee again, to purchase the software. So was his frame weak? Was mine better? Was this just the situation? Did he realize my request made sense? Or did my Frame hold while his broke? It's hard to tell. And it really doesn't matter. The point is Bob had frame and I had frame. I needed something so I reframed the situation and took control of an (admittedly pointless) conversation. Had Bob been inclined to, he could have pushed back a lot harder due to his senior position in the hierarchy. But, given the situation, there was simply no point in pushing his frame only to then have to admit that, yes, we probably do need that piece of software. Such a complex dynamic. And we distill it down to one word: Frame. Let's look at a few more examples of this concept in action. #Frame &amp; Intersexual Relationships ---- I think we all acknowledge that frame is important to both sexual strategy and interpersonal relation in general. We can also all agree that having solid frame is a net positive. Where the discussion gets interesting is in how specific individuals use their frame and how that frame is expressed. Let's look at another anecdote: &gt; Sally is generally submissive to her long time boyfriend, Mark, whom she respects. Occasionally she wants a favor and makes this known with a cute smile and shy words. Because Mark doesn't want to be an asshole and likes Sally, he listens to her, and often lets her have her way . Again, we have two frames, and a subtle reframe. Let's completely ignore that Mark is undoubtedly BP for a moment. You'll notice that he has fairly solid frame, enough to earn respect and maintain a steady relationship. But, just as in the earlier anecdote, it slips in the case of a reframe and the request Sally makes is now made from within her frame. It would be naive to say Mark has bad frame. It's not very dynamic, but because I've known Mark for years, I can say without a doubt that he's pretty damn solid. He can handle most situations with confidence and doesn't grovel or pull stupid BP shit. He is, essentially, a natural alpha. His only flaw is he's bad at re-framing around Sally. The reason for this, I assume, is because he doesn't see why it's necessary. He has always had solid frame (as far as I know) and hasn't had trouble with girls. As a result, he doesn't see his girlfriend making an innocent request as a problem. And, really, it isn't. His frame is firm enough otherwise that the odd request Sally makes is quite reasonable. On the off chance she does behave poorly, he will naturally react the way he should, and Sally has learned to not misbehave around him or he'll play instinctive soft dread. When I meet Sally without Mark around, her frame is slightly different. She will not be submissive by default and can, in fact, be quite headstrong. Her frame also is fairly solid when compared to other women I know. She has her shit together and isn't prone to flaky behavior, though she will pull Mark into her frame when she wants something. That methodology makes logical sense. She can't directly assert her interests around him so she has to get Mark to see things 'her' way first. By now it should be evident why frame is such a iffy concept. Sure, we can dismiss Mark for being BP, having bad frame, and letting Sally walk over him. But that's just not how it plays out in real life and I've never seen it happen - ever. Such a blanket statement would be an over-simplification of a complex human interaction. And what about reframing? Is that just as complex? #Reframing in Detail ---- We tend to think of frame as something that is to be 'held' and 'maintained'. We as men are the rocks, constants amidst a sea of emotions and ever-changing variables. Unfortunately, everyone  even the most rock solid natural alpha  will eventually have trouble with frame. Maybe it's a really bad day. Or a moment of carelessness. Whatever the reason, we all slip up. The solution to this conundrum is what we've come to know as the reframe. Now, before we get to the specifics, I want to throw something in: I'm inherently unstable, emotionally and mentally. I have a horrible time with solid frame. It just doesn't work reliably. Now, I made a post a while back about applying RP principles to the specifics of one's life, and this is what I did with Frame too. Once it became clear I was not going to be a rock-solid constant at all times, I settled for the next best option: become a rock when necessary. This saves energy and, frankly, keeps me sane. What I do is, rather than maintain the frame itself, I internalized the core ideas my frame is built around. Essentially, I keep a 'mental reference' to the behaviors, actions, speech patterns, and mannerisms required to establish frame. When I need to be solid, I project that onto my actions. The result is quite similar to how you (re)frame a situation: you draw on the actions, words, and behaviors that establish your Frame. Or rather, you do the best you can in a given situation. Another anecdote to illustrate the concept and its limiations: &gt; My girlfriend, Lucy, interrupted me during work because she wanted to cuddle. I responded by giving her attention and indulging in her emotional banter. When it became clear Lucy wanted more of my time, I adopted behavior that would lead to sex. After we'd had our fun, I continued working without interruption. In this case, my frame was terrible. I got caught off guard and sucked into Lucy's frame. There was an acute danger of getting stuck there, so I reframed in the simplest way I could think of: initiate sex and push for dominance (two fairly standard pillars of masculine Frame). That way I was getting something in return for my time, and could regain control of the interaction. I use this example because it's a case of a fuck-up. Ideally, it should not have happened and I would have realized earlier she was re-framing the situation, but practically these kind of things happen all the time. Especially in LTRs, where it's hard to gain physical distance and maintaining constant frame is a drain. So I got myself in an unfavorable position and had to make the best of what I knew: Lucy likes having sex with me, responds well to physical cues, and this situation wasn't going to be resolved with 'conversation'. It was a simple matter to adopt a set of mannerisms; flip the situation around so it was me initiating sex with her, and thereby extract myself from her frame. That is almost always how a reframe works. One flips the situation around. It's almost always a flip and, once you've got back in control, you can dictate where things go again. Trying to do that before the reframe (in this case sex) would have been stupid and would have led to conflict as I was stuck in her frame. It was tactically more efficient to take the hit of bad frame and install better frame than to try and directly resolve the issue from within hers. As a result, there was no argument, no fight, no disagreement, and no struggle for control of the dynamics. Now, that was a fairly soft reframe, and I'd like to remind everyone that there is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to reframing. It's hightly dependant on the situation, what frame you're in, what tools you have at your disposal, and how 'hard' you're willing to push for control. Let's look at another example of that in action: &gt; During an argument with my ex, Rebecca, I'm accused of not showing her enough attention and not caring. My response is to tell her she can just come to me. Another argument ensues over that I am never emotionally available when she needs me, to which I respond with the same: if she needs me, I am here. She knows that. After continued frustration, drama, and arguing, she admits maybe it was her fault for not coming to me. This anecdote references a messier and much trickier reframe - one that also illustrates how complex frame can be, being both a situational and long-term thing. What the snippet above doesn't explain is why the argument started and doesn't illustrate that nothing we were talking about was in fact any way relevant. It was all about me not submitting to her frame, which I had been doing for some time, until I suddenly stopped by playing dread and ignoring her. Our interests were completely opposed. The only way to reach a resolution was to force my frame or submit to hers. Obviously, I wasn't willing to submit, so I took a stand and waited it out. The incident occurred before I knew about TRP so I didn't even have a handy technical manual to refer to. The best I could manage was: flip the blame onto her, play devil's advocate, and hold my ground until the argument had run its course. Not exactly the pride of RP behavior there, but it does showcase a hard and messy reframe that in fact took many weeks to accomplish. Once I'd extracted myself from her mental point of origin and divorced myself from her interests, she could do or say anything; unless my frame broke again, she was not going to get her way. But I had to get out of her frame first (hence the dread that led to the argument in the first place). Otherwise, I would have been too emotionally invested in her (onesitis, unicorn syndrome, etc) to actually hold my own. And not just in the moment. I had to reframe: - the situation (refusing to give in) - past actions (blaming her - this is technically gaslighting) - the entire relationship (pre-emptive dread) That's three levels of frame, none of which are directly related to one another, but all of which affect the situation. And each one had to be handled with a different solution. This is just one insignificant example; an argument that lasted maybe half an hour. But it was tied into events that spanned almost two years. When you break it apart like that, it's easy to see why these sorts of things are so hard to wrap ones head around. They are exceedingly complex and inter-connected. We want a simple answer and we called it Frame. And that's why understanding the mechanics behind the word is so important. Frame quite literally changes the way you perceive the world on a day to day basis. You can love someone in one frame and hate them in another - how many of us have been in that situation? Adoring a woman but still being hopelessly frustrated by her? Especially during the BP days? If you've been in that situation, then you know what frame (or being stuck in another's) can do to your mind. It's really quite alarming when you realize just how much of a difference one's mental point of origin makes. #On Female Frame ---- Okay, this is getting long, I'd still like to take a moment here to speak about female frame specifically. The reason for this is because it seems to not be very well understood and is the cause of much confusion here on TRP. Female frame, like almost everything related to women, is emotionally driven and therefore very vague and ill-defined. Being inside their frame, as a result, is to live within their emotionally charged world. Anyone who's been stuck deep in their frame (e.g. BB Marriage, BP relationship, etc) will know how frustrating, inconsistent, and confusing this is. And that's in addition to how any Frame warps the way we view the world. Nasty stuff right there - a perfect recipe for unintentional or self-inflicted gaslighting by the way. Naturally, TRP realized that female frame is a bad thing and should be avoided by maintaining our own frame. RP readers apply that with great success. Except some of us end up frustrated because it's impossible to share emotional connections with women. The consensus then becomes that 'deep' relationships with women are impossible. They are only good for fucking. Gentlemen, please think that through for a moment: we are (hopefully) all holding frame more or less consistently, enforcing our logic and generally stable state on women. And then we complain that it's cold, logical, and emotionless? When we made it that way by design - by virtue of how we crafterd our frames? Surely you can see the fallacy here and why understanding the mechanics of Frame is so damn important. Properly, the statement should be: deep relationships with women are impossible when always maintaining male frame. Whether you believe it's worth submitting to female frame, even if just temporarily, or not - that's your choice. The dangers are manifold (onesitis, unicorn syndrome, beta behavior) and risking that step requires good control and ability to frame / reframe. I won't try to make a case either way and let everyone decide for themselves. This was just a good way to illustrate how misunderstood the concept of Frame is, and why male frame bumping up against female frame causes so many issues in inter-personal relationships. #Post Reframe Reactions ---- One more thing that really needs to be said: after a successful reframe, people tend to respond with negative verbal or nonverbal patterns. With men it may be something like Fine, we'll do it your way or Whatever you say or Fuck you - usually a direct admission that the shift has happened. With women the meaning is usually hidden in subtext and the words tend to sound more like You're such a jerk or I can't have serious talks with you or You're impossible. The reason I mention these phrases is that, except for in very rare cases, they mean the reframe went down successfully and you can go back to 'regular' interaction  though not without being wary of a future attempt at reframe on their behalf; you aren't in a safe zone, just back in control. It's important to realize that this shift has occurred so that you don't keep pushing for frame when you already have it. That tends to come off as overbearing or domineering. In rare circumstances, that effect is desirable. Most of the time however it backfires and you end up with a new problem. The thing to remember is that reframing is asserting dominance in some form  even if it's done politely  and often elicits negative responses from the person forced to give up their frame. That's understandable and to be expected. They are surrendering control, after all, and most likely feel attacked, frustrated, helpless, or something similar. Pushing too far in this moment of vulnerability can lead to all sorts of weird behavior, regardless of gender, as the person who lost frame begins to realize how helpless they are. Fear responses may kick in, the other person might fight back directly, or maybe they just start feeling very ill at ease with the situation. Unless it's your intent to make them feel that way, and it probably won't be in most cases, ease off. Return to whatever you consider normal patterns. You've established your frame. All you have to do now is maintain it. There's rarely a need to shove it down anyone's throat. #Conclusion ---- Frame is a complex topic that, as with most RP ideas, depends on the individuals involved and the situation they find themselves in. While the basics (maintaining frame, reframing, general trends of male vs female frame) can be outlined in abstract terms, the specifics of how these concepts play out in practice cannot. The examples given in this post have shown versions of maintaining frame and reframing, both in more and less 'traditional' variations. We also took a brief look at how our frame and reframes affect others, with particular weight being given to how female frame is often suppressed by male frame. In summary, anecdotal examples were used to illustrate the aspects of interpersonal relationships and human interaction which TRP refers to in shorthand as 'Frame'."

If you aren't, you should be. Go read. Without Rollo Tomassi, the Book of Pook, and so on, we would not be here today. Don't just skim the sidebar. Read it, follow the links, read, lather rinse repeat. Today, we will be revisiting one of the basics: [**Iron Rule of Tomassi #6**](URL &gt;&gt; *Women are incapable of loving men in a way that a man idealizes is possible, in a way he thinks she should be capable of.* Read it, because the devil is in the details: &gt;&gt; *Shes not incapable of love in the way she defines it, shes incapable of love as you would have it. She doesnt lack the capacity for connection and emotional investment, she lacks the capacity for the connection you think would ideally suit you.* Now it's time to refine it from the benefit of our additional five years of understanding: **Iron Rule #6a: If women cannot love you the way you want to be loved, then you want the wrong kind of love**. That's right, it's your fault, not theirs. Women are creatures of emotion and instinct, and what they do precedes from who they are. If you expect women to love you in a way they cannot, you are trying to teach a canary to talk, or a parrot to sing. How do women love? There are two kinds of love: **Respectful Love**, and **Protective Love**. Protective love is the love of a superior for an inferior. It is not repelled by weakness or vulnerability. It does not serve, submit, or give up power. It controls, dominates, and protects. It will sacrifice safety and comfort for the benefit of its object, but never dignity. It concerns itself with the welfare of its object, but not with the object's whims or commands. The **Flow of Protective Love** is: Man -&gt; Woman -&gt; Child Respectful love is the love of an inferior for a superior. It is inspired by strength and self-assurance, and destroyed by weakness or vulnerability. It serves, submits, and gives up power, but does not control, dominate, or protect. It will sacrifice dignity for its object. It concerns itself with the whims or demands, but never the welfare of its object. The **Flow of Respectful Love** is: Child -&gt; Woman -&gt; Man *Men who want Protective Love from women are broken men.* They are idealizing their mothers' love towards them, noticing that it is identical to the love they feel for women, and deciding that's what love is. But such men will never be loved at all until they learn of the existence of Respectful Love, and figure out how to inspire it. Your woman will never count up the sacrifices you make for her, tally them, mark them, and respond with gratitude, for the same reason that a child will never spontaneously notice the sacrifices of a parent. Monitoring your state, and putting herself in your shoes, would be a Protective act. Parents who have grateful children are not the ones who have made great sacrifices for their children, but the ones who have *taught* their children to honor and respect them, and show that gratitude. This is why you must learn to rule your woman, or she will rule you. Because if you love her, she must love you also, else you are her slave. And if you do not rule over her, if you are not superior to her, she will see you as a child in the body of a man, and any affection she ever holds for you will also be blended with contempt. *Women are capable of love. They are capable of self-sacrifice. They are capable of devotion.* But to receive it, you must abandon ideals from your mother. You must put away childish things. You must stop expecting women to sympathize with you or be concerned for your safety or welfare. Instead, you must decide for yourself what your needs are, and demand them as a condition of your protection and care. "

Guess what happens next.",597,4iffvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4iffvm/guy_on_okcupid_subreddit_needs_emotional_support/,2016-05-09 03:29:31,"**Summary: Women make absolutely terrible emotional support. She needs her man to be a rock, and if he isn't then she'll take her pussy elsewhere. Do not rely on a woman to help you out through hard times. Talk to your male friends instead; they will actually care and support you.** [Full thread here.](URL Those who read my threads know I don't hold back any punches. When a man is acting like a beta bitch, I call him a beta bitch. It's the only way they learn. But this thread on the OKCupid subreddit tugged at my heartstrings a little bit and I'm having trouble being mean to the dude. It's just sad. OP has been in a relationship with a girl who is always clingy (read: relies on him as a strong alpha rock). The moment - and I mean the *moment* he displays vulnerability by admitting that he's worried about passing final exams, her face puckers up and her vagina clamps shut like the security gates at Fort Knox. A few days later she breaks up with him. Read his words for yourself to really absorb what female nature is like... &gt;Mine: It was during the last days of finals. She was already done with hers and had gone home for a few days. She came back to pack up her stuff. I tagged along to help. We pack up her belongings and go down to the pizzeria downstairs. We sit down with our food and shes tells me she wants to break up out of nowhere. Im like what? Shes like ive been too clingy this past week and she cant handle it. I tell her wtf, you've been clingy our whole relationship shes like I know but its unattractive when a guy acts like it. Im taken back, I just wanna stab her with my fork at this point. She eats her food and I dont even touch mine. &gt;We head back to my apartment where she collects the stuff she had left over. She tells me shes going back home today. I'm like stay the night so we can talk and try to fix things. Shes like no shes done. I tell her to call me or text me so I know she got home safe she never does. I had a final the next day but i was too heartbroken and confused to study. &gt;The next day I take my final which I fail. She was suppose to be my ride back from my final to my apartment, but obviously she was gone. I check for the shuttle and its broken down and theres a 2 hour wait. It's a sunday so all the college buildings are locked. I start walking back to my apartment which is 5 miles away. On my way home I walk past our fav eatery when its starts pouring rain. At that very moment is when I felt the saddest most alone in my life. She didn't look back or feel a shred of remorse. Hell, she didn't even feel emotional enough to stop eating her food during the conversation. And that's the female imperative. ""Weakness and vulnerability detected. Abort relationship, branch swing immediately. Bzzzt. In ten, nine, eight..."" The thing is, we at RedPill know this so we don't fall into these traps ourselves and end up getting hurt later. If only OP was clued in to what women are really like, he could have build up some resilience ahead of time, resolved to not display weakness in front of his girlfriend, passed his exams and continued to get sex from her. And hey, who knows, maybe this will be the electric shock to finally wake him up. Maybe this will be the moment he understands that **the only person you should emotionally rely on is your mother and your male friends**. That's it. Males have empathy, we understand what difficult times are like. We'll help you commiserate over boxing gloves or a stout at the local bar. Females? Females will leave you to go snuggle up with Chad the minute you drop the ball. Some of the commenter stories in that thread are also enlightening... &gt;Wife cheated, Found out, wanted it to work but the guy she was cheating with had a really fat bank balance which I could never match with my pay grade. &gt;Served me Divorce paper at work out of no where. I went to the rooftop at work, cried like a bitch and lit up a cigarette &amp; burned her pic that I had in my wallet. Saddest day of my life. Yep. The other guy had Alpha vibes so strong that hubby just couldn't compete. &gt;For nearly four years of coupledom, she'd been asking me to be more emotionally open. Practically begging, at times. I've never been one to talk about my feelings much, and I default to dealing with my problems on my own rather than sharing them with other people. She was very much the opposite: regular sharer, always stressing the need for healthy communication in a relationship, big believer in non-violent communication and so on. It was always a sticking point between us. &gt;Anyway, I'm self-employed, and a few months ago I lost a couple of big clients in quick succession. For once, I opened up to her about it. I told her that I didn't know which direction I was going in, that I felt hopeless, that I didn't know what I was going to do to make sure I could keep paying rent. Well, that was the end of the relationship. Lesson learned, I guess. ^ Four years. These guys were together FOUR YEARS. And as soon as the woman detects that the meal ticket is almost expired, she ejects. Because he failed the biggest shit test in the book, he succumbed to her nagging that she wanted a more ""emotionally open man"". &gt;Caught my wife cheating of 20 years with coworkers, again. Self confidence had already paid too much a price so I packed my shit up and left. &gt;Had a couple of counseling appointments where her only responses were that it was my fault. Ditched her and my entire friend circle that rallied behind her because I was the asshole. I did nothing wrong that couldn't have been fixed with proper communication, and I lost literally everything and no support system to get me through it. &gt;Came out the other end a tough mother fucker. ^ I wanted to leave this above post for the end because it leaves us on an optimistic note. This guy's wife cheated, he got divorced, tried to go to ""couple's counseling"" like a good little Beta Bob. Finally grew a spine and ditched his old toxic life to start anew, became a tough motherfucker and is now on top of the world. This is what OP needs to do. He needs to swallow the RedPill and understand that it's up to us, as men, to forge our own path in life. Our women will not help us. Women only have two purposes. Sex, and passive feminine support that feels good but is contingent on you having your shit together (like cooking dinner, giving backrubs, decorating the house, entertaining guests at dinner parties, etc). Those two are the only things she can ever give you. Don't expect more. Every man has a story like OP's that jolted him and exposed him to reality. What's your story? **TL;DR: Women are awful at giving any kind of support when your luck is down. Rely on men, not women. The only use girls have is sex and passive feminine energy.**"
107,vulnerability,TheRedPill,"The line ""There are plenty more fish in the sea"" sounds like the perfect thing to say to a man after a breakup. It's not. Here's why.",113,4iul8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4iul8u/the_line_there_are_plenty_more_fish_in_the_sea/,2016-05-11 22:07:37,"tl;dr at the bottom. We think of that line as a great catch-all ""comforting"" phrase to say to a BP man who's an emotional wreck after the loss of his beloved Sally, the apple of his eye who is now out being infested with worms as he sits in his room, mostly crying, beating his breast and wondering where it all went wrong. ""There are more girls out there, man!"" ""Don't sweat it bro, there's more where she came from."" **There are plenty more fish in the sea.** Here at the Red Pill, we promote Abundance Mentality. For the greenhorns joining our ranks, welcome, and if you don't know what Abundance Mentality is, it's essentially the belief that yes, there *are* plenty more fish in the sea, and therefore you should stop worrying about the goldfish in your tank; you should be casting your eyes and your wooden rod over the vast ocean and see which fish takes the bait. So theoretically, such a phrase is *perfect* to say to the victim of a recently deceased relationship. It's not. Why? *Because it makes the man think the fish are already waiting for him.* Often, when a woman's proverbial lightswitch is flipped off and she no longer finds love in her heart for the man she is in a relationship with, it's because the man's SMV has faded away. Comfortable from a life under the warm spell of oneitis, the man simply fails to pay attention to his Mission, his pursuit of improvement and hard work, as he feels as though he has all he needs. The ""love of his life"" is by his side. Why worry? Why waste energy? Of course, as we all know, the SMV he is neglecting is what brought his love to his side in the first place, and so she leaves. The man is charged, tried, and convicted with personal neglect and apathy, as well as romantic obsession and addiction, and he is punished by the trailing footsteps of his woman, which have been immediately preceded by the chilling words, ""I just don't think this is working out."" So now, our ""unlucky"" fellow is left to ponder, cry, and all of the above. What I hope you have gotten from all that lyrical drivel is that as we know, SMV is the driving force behind a woman's attraction. You cannot negotiate attraction, you can only advertise your attractiveness. So therefore, if the ""love of your life"" does not approve of your SMV, *why would any other fish-in-the-sea worth your attention approve either?* Two years ago, the last relationship of my life ended spontaneously, for reasons above. I had barely started reading this site, and all of a sudden, I was slapped in the face with all that crushing reality. However, the words that were spoken to me in my time of emotional vulnerability were not those I was expecting. No bluepill warm hugs for me, no sir. Instead of Fish-In-The-Sea, my closest ally and friend told me these words. ""There is more that you must do. Your Mission is not yet over. Get up, and keep fighting."" Two years, 40 bulked-up pounds, mountains of saved dollars, and so many dripping pussies later, I am still fighting. tl;dr: If you are a skilled fisherman, there are plenty of fish in the sea. If you are not, all you will find is weed, aluminium cans, and tears as salty as the vast, unfeeling ocean. So before you believe those sweet, comforting words, you must learn how to fish. edit: words"
108,vulnerability,TheRedPill,24 stages of the seductive process from Robert Greene's The Art of Seduction,23,4jb9nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4jb9nd/24_stages_of_the_seductive_process_from_robert/,2016-05-14 22:43:03,"**Phase One: SeparationStirring Interest and Desire** 1 Choose the Right Victim *Everything depends on the target of your seduction. Study your prey thoroughly, and choose only those who will prove susceptible to your charms. The right victims are those for whom you can fill a void, who see in you something exotic. They are often isolated or unhappy, or can easily be made sofor the completely contented person is almost impossible to seduce. The perfect victim has some quality that inspires strong emotions in you, making your seductive maneuvers seem more natural and dynamic. The perfect victim allows for the perfect chase.* 2 Create a False Sense of SecurityApproach Indirectly *If you are too direct early on, you risk stirring up a resistance that will never be lowered. At first there must be nothing of the seducer in your manner. The seduction should begin at an angle, indirectly, so that the target only gradually becomes aware of you. Haunt the periphery of your target's lifeapproach through a third party, or seem to cultivate a relatively neutral relationship, moving gradually from friend to lover. Lull the target into feeling secure, then strike.* 3 Send Mixed Signals *Once people are aware of your presence, and perhaps vaguely intrigued, you need to stir their interest before it settles on someone else. Most of us are much too obviousinstead, be hard to figure out. Send mixed signals: both tough and tender, both spiritual and earthly, both innocent and cunning. A mix of qualities suggests depth, which fascinates even as it confuses. An elusive, enigmatic aura will make people want to know more, drawing them into your circle. Create such a power by hinting at something contradictory within you.* 4 Appear to Be an Object of DesireCreate Triangles *Few are drawn to the person whom others avoid or neglect; people gather around those who have already attracted interest. To draw your victims closer and make them hungry to possess you, you must create an aura of desirabilityof being wanted and courted by many. It will become a point of vanity for them to be the preferred object of your attention, to win you away from a crowd of admirers. Build a reputation that precedes you: If many have succumbed to your charms, there must be a reason.* 5 Create a NeedStir Anxiety and Discontent *A perfectly satisfied person cannot be seduced. Tension and disharmony must be instilled in your targets minds. Stir within them feelings of discontent, an unhappiness with their circumstances and with themselves. The feelings of inadequacy that you create will give you space to insinuate yourself, to make them see you as the answer to their problems. Pain and anxiety are the proper precursors to pleasure. Learn to manufacture the need that you can fill.* 6 Master the Art of Insinuation *Making your targets feel dissatisfied and in need of your attention is essential, but if you are too obvious, they will see through you and grow defensive. There is no known defense, how- ever, against insinuationthe art of planting ideas in people's minds by dropping elusive hints that take root days later, even appearing to them as their own idea. Create a sublanguage bold statements followed by retraction and apology, ambiguous comments, banal talk combined with alluring glancesthat enters the target's unconscious to convey your real meaning. Make everything suggestive.* 7 Enter Their Spirit *Most people are locked in their own worlds, making them stubborn and hard to persuade. The way to lure them out of their shell and set up your seduction is to enter their spirit. Play by their rules, enjoy what they enjoy, adapt yourself to their moods. In doing so you will stroke their deep-rooted narcissism and lower their defenses. Indulge your targets' every mood and whim, giving them nothing to react against or resist.* 8 Create Temptation *Lure the target deep into your seduction by creating the proper temptation: a glimpse of the pleasures to come. As the serpent tempted Eve with the promise of forbidden knowledge, you must awaken a desire in your targets that they cannot control. Find that weakness of theirs, that fantasy that has yet to be realized, and hint that you can lead them toward it. The key is to keep it vague. Stimulate a curiosity stronger than the doubts and anxieties that go with it, and they will follow you.* **Phase Two: Lead AstrayCreating Pleasure and Confusion** 9 Keep Them in SuspenseWhat Comes Next? *The moment people feel they know what to expect from you, your spell on them is broken. More: You have ceded them power. The only way to lead the seduced along and keep the up- per hand is to create suspense, a calculated surprise. Doing something they do not expect from you will give them a delightful sense of spontaneitythey will not be able to foresee what comes next. You are always one step ahead and in control. Give the victim a thrill with a sudden change of direction.* 10 Use the Demonic Power of Words to Sow Confusion *It is hard to make people listen; they are consumed with their own thoughts and desires, and have little timefor yours. The trick to making them listen is to say what they want to hear, to fill their ears with whatever is pleasant to them. This is the essence of seductive language. In- flame people's emotions with loaded phrases, flatter them, comfort their insecurities, envelop them in sweet words and promises, and not only will they listen to you, they will lose their will to resist you.* 11 Pay Attention to Detail *Lofty words of love and grand gestures can be suspicious: Why are you trying so hard to please? The details of a seductionthe subtle gestures, the offhand things you doare often more charming and revealing. You must learn to distract your victims with a myriad of pleasant little ritualsthoughtful gifts tailored just for them, clothes and adornments designed to please them, gestures that show the time and attention you are paying them. Mesmerized by what they see, they will not notice what you are really up to.* 12 Poeticize Your Presence *Important things happen when your targets are alone: The slightest feeling of relief that you are not there, and it is all over. Familiarity and overexposure will cause this reaction. Remain elusive, then. Intrigue your targets by alternating an exciting presence with a cool distance, exuberant moments followed by calculated absences. Associate yourself with poetic images and objects, so that when they think of you, they begin to see you through an idealized halo. The more you figure in their minds, the more they will envelop you in seductive fantasies.* 13 Disarm Through Strategic Weakness and Vulnerability *Too much maneuvering on your part may raise suspicion. The best way to cover your tracks is to make the other person feel superior and stronger. If you seem to be weak, vulnerable, en- thralled by the other person, and unable to control yourself you will make your actions look more natural, less calculated. Physical weaknesstears, bashfulness, palenesswill help cre- ate the effect. Play the victim, then transform your target's sympathy into love.* 14 Confuse Desire and RealityThe Perfect Illusion *To compensate for the difficulties in their lives, people spend a lot of their time daydreaming, imagining a future full of adventure, success, and romance. If you can create the illusion that through you they can live out their dreams, you will have them at your mercy. Aim at secret wishes that have been thwarted or repressed, stirring up uncontrollable emotions, clouding their powers of reason. Lead the seduced to a point of confusion in which they can no longer tell the difference between illusion and reality.* 15 Isolate the Victim *An isolated person is weak. By slowly isolating your victims, you make them more vulnerable to your influence. Take them away from their normal milieu, friends, family, home. Give them the sense of being marginalized, in limbothey are leaving one world behind and entering another. Once isolated like this, they have no outside support, and in their confusion they are easily led astray. Lure the seduced into your lair, where nothing is familiar.* **Phase Three: The PrecipiceDeepening the Effect Through Extreme Measures** 16 Prove Yourself *Most people want to be seduced. If they resist your efforts, it is probably because you ham' not gone far enough to allay their doubtsabout your motives, the depth of yourfeelings, and so on. One well-timed action that shows how far you are willing to go to win them over will dis- pel their doubts. Do not worry about looking foolish or making a mistakeany kind of deed that is self-sacrificing and for your targets' sake will so overwhelm their emotions, they won't notice anything else.* 17 Effect a Regression *People who have experienced a certain kind of pleasure in the past will try to repeat or relive it. The deepest-rooted and most pleasurable memories are usually those from earliest child- hood, and are often unconsciously associated with a parental figure. Bring your targets back to that point by placing yourself in the oedipal triangle and positioning them as the needy child. Unaware of the cause of their emotional response, they will fall in love with you.* 18 Stir Up the Transgressive and Taboo *There are always social limits on what one can do. Some of these, the most elemental taboos, go back centuries; others are more superficial, simply defining polite and acceptable behavior. Making your targets feel that you are leading them past either kind of limit is immensely se- ductive. People yearn to explore their dark side. Once the desire to transgress draws your tar- gets to you, it will be hard for them to stop. Take them farther than they imaginedthe shared feeling of guilt and complicity will create a powerful bond.* 19 Use Spiritual Lures *Everyone has doubts and insecuritiesabout their body, their self-worth, their sexuality. If your seduction appeals exclusively to the physical, you will stir up these doubts and make your targets self-conscious. Instead, lure them out of their insecurities by making them focus on something sublime and spiritual: a religious experience, a lofty work of art, the occult. Lost in a spiritual mist, the target will feel light and uninhibited. Deepen the effect of your seduction by making its sexual culmination seem like the spiritual union of two souls.* 20 Mix Pleasure with Pain *The greatest mistake in seduction is being too nice. At first, perhaps, your kindness is charm- ing, but it soon grows monotonous; you are trying too hard to please, and seem insecure. In- stead of overwhelming your targets with niceness, try inflicting some pain. Make them feel guilty and insecure. Instigate a breakupnow a rapprochement, a return to your earlier kind- ness, will turn them weak at the knees. The lower the lows you create, the greater the highs. To heighten the erotic charge, create the excitement of fear.* **Phase Four: Moving In for the Kill** 21 Give Them Space to FallThe Pursuer Is Pursued *If your targets become too used to you as the aggressor, they will give less of their own energy, and the tension will slacken. You need to wake them up, turn the tables. Once they are under your spell, take a step bach and they will start to come after you. Hint that you are growing bored. Seem interested in someone else. Soon they will want to possess you physically, and re- straint will go out the window. Create the illusion that the seducer is being seduced.* 22 Use Physical Lures *Targets with active minds are dangerous: If they see through your manipulations, they may suddenly develop doubts. Put their minds gently to rest, and waken their dormant senses, by combining a nondefensive attitude with a charged sexual presence. While your cool, nonchalant air is lowering their inhibitions, your glances, voice, and bearingoozing sex and desireare getting under their skin and raising their temperature. Never force the physical; instead infect your targets with heat, lure them into lust. Morality, judgment, and concern for the future will all melt away.* 23 Master the Art of the Bold Move *A moment has arrived: Your victim clearly desires you, but is not ready to admit it openly, let alone act on it. This is the time to throw aside chivalry, kindness, and coquetry and to over- whelm with a bold move. Don't give the victim time to consider the consequences. Showing hesitation or awkwardness means you are thinking of yourself as opposed to being over- whelmed by the victim's charms. One person must go on the offensive, and it is you.* 24 Beware the Aftereffects *Danger follows in the aftermath of a successful seduction. After emotions have reached a pitch, they often swing in the opposite directiontoward lassitude, distrust, disappointment. If you are to part, make the sacrifice swift and sudden. If you are to stay in a relationship, beware a flagging of energy, a creeping familiarity that will spoil the fantasy. A second seduction is required. Never let the other person take you for granteduse absence, create pain and conflict, to keep the seduced on tenterhooks.*"

Few days ago /u/WhySoRuff published a great post [The MBTI personality type is to man what an Astrological sign is to woman.](URL Here's my analysis of the INTP personality. Written mostly for my own use. I hope it will start a discussion on our roadmap. If you haven't taken the personality test yet, you can try it out at [16personalities](URL While a lot of advice I've come up with has already been reiterated in TRP, this analysis allows you to identify those points as the most important to you. ****** # Overview &gt; The INTP personality type is fairly rare, making up only three percent of the population, which is definitely a good thing for them, as there's nothing they'd be more unhappy about than being ""common"". INTPs pride themselves on their inventiveness and creativity, their unique perspective and vigorous intellect. Usually known as the philosopher, the architect, or the dreamy professor, INTPs have been responsible for many scientific discoveries throughout history. * Fear of being common - perceiving being a weirdo as a good thing * Prone to break Law 38: Think as you like, but behave as others * Might be related to the phenomenon described in NMMNG: Boys with no good male role models grow up to be proud in how different they are from other men, especially their fathers. * Prescription: **Force yourself to be more of a boring, ordinary man** * Great inventiveness and creativity * Prone to over-innovate things that already work * Prescription: **Don't fix it if it ain't broke. Get comfortable with things being good enough** * Proud of their creativity - risk of down-playing importance of other personality traits. * Prescription: **Admire, cheer for and learn from people excelling in other ways.** &gt; They love patterns, and spotting discrepancies between statements could almost be described as a hobby, making it a bad idea to lie to an INTP. This makes it ironic that INTPs' word should always be taken with a grain of salt  it's not that they are dishonest, but people with the INTP personality type tend to share thoughts that are not fully developed, using others as a sounding board for ideas and theories in a debate against themselves rather than as actual conversation partners. * Prone to share thoughts just to test them out. * Risk of unwillingly outraging people * Losing control over one's image * Prescription: **Shut up. Talk less. Only when you are certain of what you are saying and how you are conveying it.** * Prescription: **Notice patterns of how people react to your words. Accept your responsibility over that.** &gt; This may make them appear unreliable, but in reality no one is more enthusiastic and capable of spotting a problem, drilling through the endless factors and details that encompass the issue and developing a unique and viable solution than INTPs  just don't expect punctual progress reports. People who share the INTP personality type aren't interested in practical, day-to-day activities and maintenance, but when they find an environment where their creative genius and potential can be expressed, there is no limit to the time and energy INTPs will expend in developing an insightful and unbiased solution. * Dislike for mundane, systematic repetitive work. Always like to climb the mountain on the north face. * Prescription: **Have a schedule. Stick to it.** * Prescription: **Take up activities where there is no hard-to-find-but-short path to success. Lifting is an obvious one.** * Prone to over-invest in problems that are not significant but enjoyable for the intellectual challenge. * Prescription: **Before taking on a challenge, evaluate the expected outcomes against expected investment required.** &gt; They may appear to drift about in an unending daydream, but INTPs' thought process is unceasing, and their minds buzz with ideas from the moment they wake up. This constant thinking can have the effect of making them look pensive and detached, as they are often conducting full-fledged debates in their own heads, but really INTPs are quite relaxed and friendly when they are with people they know, or who share their interests. However, this can be replaced by overwhelming shyness when INTP personalities are among unfamiliar faces, and friendly banter can quickly become combative if they believe their logical conclusions or theories are being criticized. * Appear dreamy. * Prescription: **Get more grounded.** But how? * Shy around unfamiliar faces. * Prescription: **Attend more social events, where you don't know anyone.** * Prescription: **With people you don't know, assume are friendly, but sometimes you don't get it.** &gt; When INTPs are particularly excited, the conversation can border on incoherence as they try to explain the daisy-chain of logical conclusions that led to the formation of their latest idea. Oftentimes, INTPs will opt to simply move on from a topic before it's ever understood what they were trying to say, rather than try to lay things out in plain terms. * Prone to get over-excited and speak incoherently. * Prescription: **Be aware of excitement rising. When that happens, make a habit of speaking slower, use simple terms, finish your train of thought before moving on. Err on the side of sounding narcoleptic, patronising, and like a simpleton. Excitement should become an anchor triggering this mode.** * Prescription: **Again, talk less.** &gt; The reverse can also be true when people explain their thought processes to INTPs in terms of subjectivity and feeling. Imagine an immensely complicated clockwork, taking in every fact and idea possible, processing them with a heavy dose of creative reasoning and returning the most logically sound results available  this is how the INTP mind works, and this type has little tolerance for an emotional monkey-wrench jamming their machines. * Have difficulty understanding subjective communication, feelings, emotions. * Risk of misunderstanding, coming off as uncaring, etc. * Prescription: **Develop Emotional Intelligence** (But how?) &gt; Further, with Thinking (T) as one of their governing traits, INTPs are unlikely to understand emotional complaints at all, and their friends won't find a bedrock of emotional support in them. People with the INTP personality type would much rather make a series of logical suggestions for how to resolve the underlying issue, a perspective that is not always welcomed by their Feeling (F) companions. This will likely extend to most social conventions and goals as well, like planning dinners and getting married, as INTPs are far more concerned with originality and efficient results. * Provide poor emotional support, looking for a logical solutions instead. * Prescription: **Only give advice when asked for it.** * Risk of disregarding social conventions for the sake of efficiency or originality. * Prescription: **Give more respect to social conventions. Follow them, unless there is a good reason not to (efficiency often is not good enough)** &gt; The one thing that really holds INTPs back is their restless and pervasive fear of failure. INTP personalities are so prone to reassessing their own thoughts and theories, worrying that they've missed some critical piece of the puzzle, that they can stagnate, lost in an intangible world where their thoughts are never truly applied. Overcoming this self-doubt stands as the greatest challenge INTPs are likely to face, but the intellectual gifts  big and small  bestowed on the world when they do makes it worth the fight. * Paralyzing fear of failure. Overanalyzing, worrying. * Prescription: **Believe in yourself more** (Good books on that: *Gorilla Mindset*, *The New Psycho-Cybernetics*) * Prescription: **Desensitize yourself to failure and fear of failure by taking up endeavours with low success chance.** # Strengths &gt; Great Analysts and Abstract Thinkers  People with the INTP personality type view the world as a big, complex machine, and recognize that as with any machine, all parts are interrelated. INTPs excel in analyzing these connections, seeing how seemingly unrelated factors tie in with each other in ways that bewilder most other personality types. * Great at identifying complex and non-trivial patterns and inter-dependencies. * Prescription: **Leverage that ability in all areas of your life. Whenever starting a new endeavour, spend significant time observing, investigating, studying, especially successful people.** Since this activity might be more productive for you, it's worth spending more resources on it, compared to other personality types. &gt; Imaginative and Original  These connections are the product of an unrelenting imagination  INTPs' ideas may seem counter-intuitive at a glance, and may never even see the light of day, but they will always prove remarkable innovations. * Might lead to over-innovating. * Prescription: **Again, be happy with things being good enough.** &gt; Open-Minded  INTPs couldn't make these connections if they thought they knew it all  they are highly receptive to alternate theories, so long as they're supported by logic and facts. In more subjective matters like social norms and traditions, INTPs are usually fairly liberal, with a ""none of my business"" sort of attitude  peoples' ideas are what matter. &gt; Enthusiastic  When a new idea piques their interest, INTPs can be very enthusiastic  they are a reserved personality type, but if another person shares an interest, they can be downright excited about discussing it. More likely though, the only outward evidence of this enthusiasm will be INTPs' silent pacing or their staring into the distance. * Prescription: **When feeling burned out and lacking motivation/discipline to keep going, try a new idea that might get you enthusiastic.** * Difficulty with expressing enthusiasm. * Prescription: **Err on the side of exaggerating your enthusiasm about ideas.** &gt; Objective  INTPs' analysis, creativity and open-mindedness aren't the tools of some quest for ideology or emotional validation. Rather, it's as though people with the INTP personality type are a conduit for the truths around them, so far as they can be expressed, and they are proud of this role as theoretical mediator. &gt; Honest and Straightforward  To know one thing and say another would be terribly disingenuous  INTPs don't often go around intentionally hurting feelings, but they believe that the truth is the most important factor, and they expect that to be appreciated and reciprocated. * Expecting honesty to be appreciated, prone to overestimate its importance. * Prescription: **Practice telling made-up stories, exaggerating, lying, while its understood what you are saying is not true.** * Prescription: **Speak as everyone else, when you are not among people you can trust.** * Prescription: **When talking to another person and your higher or at least equal status has been already established, leverage your controversial, non-reactive honesty to boost your status further.** # Weaknesses &gt; Very Private and Withdrawn  While INTPs' intellectualism yields many insights into their surroundings, their surroundings are ironically considered an intrusion on their thoughts. This is especially true with people  INTPs are quite shy in social settings. More complicated situations such as parties exacerbate this, but even close friends struggle to get into INTPs' hearts and minds. * Prescription: **Force yourself into more social interactions.** * Prescription: **Express yourself more freely, err on the side of mumbling about your inner thoughts and feelings, especially with friends.** &gt; Insensitive  Oftentimes INTP personalities get so caught up in their logic that they forget any kind of emotional consideration  they dismiss subjectivity as irrational and tradition as an attempt to bar much-needed progress. Purely emotional situations are often utterly puzzling to INTPs, and their lack of timely sympathy can easily offend. * Prescription: **Fake it till you make it. Observe empathetic people, social conventions they follow. Mimic them, even if it doesn't make much sense to you. Especially highly emotional situations.** &gt; Absent-minded  When INTPs' interest is captured, their absence goes beyond social matters to include the rest of the physical world. INTPs become forgetful, missing even the obvious if it's unrelated to their current infatuation, and they can even forget their own health, skipping meals and sleep as they muse. * Prescription: **Learn focus and mindfulness. *Gorilla Mindset* has good chapters on that.** (Many people will probably recommend meditation, but having very extensive experience, I'm sceptical of that) &gt; Condescending  Attempts at connecting with others are often worse than INTPs' withdrawal. People with the INTP personality type take pride in their knowledge and rationale, and enjoy sharing their ideas, but in trying to explain how they got from A to B to Z, they can get frustrated, sometimes simplifying things to the point of insult as they struggle to gauge their conversation partners' perspective. The ultimate insult comes as INTPs give up with a dismissive ""never mind"". * Prescription: **When attempting to explain something, have patience and willingness to walk the other person through your thinking. Practice analogy and metaphor. Practice with small kids.** * Prescription: **Acknowledge that rationality, knowledge and intelligence are not objectively superior to other skills and traits.** &gt; Loathe Rules and Guidelines  These social struggles are partly a product of INTPs' desire to bypass the rules, of social conduct and otherwise. While this attitude helps INTPs' strength of unconventional creativity, it also causes them to reinvent the wheel constantly and to shun security in favor of autonomy in ways that can compromise both. * Prescription: **Follow existing rules, including social conventions. Even if they don't make much sense to you** * Prescription: **Learn to be content with things being good enough.** * Prescription: **Learn to be part of the team/mob/etc. Show more willingness to sacrifice your individuality and autonomy.** &gt; Second-Guess Themselves  INTPs remain so open to new information that they often never commit to a decision at all. This applies to their own skills as well  INTP personalities know that as they practice, they improve, and any work they do is second-best to what they could do. Unable to settle for this, INTPs sometimes delay their output indefinitely with constant revisions, sometimes even quitting before they ever begin. * Prescription: **When you know you will have to make a decision or commit, set a hard deadline for yourself to make it. Feel free to use any reminders, TODO apps, etc.** * Prescription: **Learn to value effort and struggle more over perfection.** * Prescription: **Have more trust in yourself and ability to perform well enough.** Again, *The New Psycho-Cybernetics* is a good book to develop that. # Relationships &gt; When it comes to romantic relationships, INTPs have an interesting mixture of traits that often pleasantly surprise their partners. People with this personality type are always full of ideas, but they have few opportunities to explore their more romantic notions. As with any of their theories, INTPs love sharing with others, and in finally meeting someone where romantic thoughts are appropriate, they show themselves to be excited, enthusiastic, and even playful, flirting with word-play and intellectual games. * Prescription: **To leverage your intellect and wit, focus your efforts on sarging during the day, online or in lounges, as opposed to loud venues at night.** * Prescription: **Be careful not to overinvest. Show less excitement than you really feel. Especially when you meet someone you click really well with.** &gt; None of this is to say that these relationships come easily to INTPs  they are shy and withdrawn individuals, and getting out and meeting new people, risking rejection and making themselves the center of attention in emotionally delicate situations are far from being their strengths. It is more likely that INTP personalities will leave a trail of breadcrumbs for a potential partner, allowing them to make the first move and committing to their partner as an act of reciprocation rather than bravado. * Prescription: **Get out more. Force yourself into social interactions.** * Prescription: **Desensitize yourself to rejection.** * Prescription: **Accept your responsibility to make the first move.** * Prescription: **Keep persisting even after previous rejections.** &gt; From the start, INTPs take their relationships seriously  their imagination and vision, and the challenge of getting to know new people, make them all too aware of how important it is that they're involved with someone, and they will prove themselves surprisingly loyal. Even early in the dating phase, INTPs are unusually direct and honest, doing their best to express their mindset and create mutual understanding, believing that this shared knowledge will help to minimize misunderstandings and avoid conflict. * Prescription: **Learn to be comfortable being single.** * Prescription: **Learn to be funny and less serious when dating.** (I find *Cocky Comedy And Other Conversational Skills* by David DeAngelo to be a great product for that) * Prescription: **Remember that until you have both committed to each other, you have no obligation towards your date. Remember also, that she's probably spinning plates.** &gt; As their relationships progress, INTPs' daily needs prove remarkably simple. Gifts, surprises, complex social plans and date nights are all fairly unimportant to people with the INTP personality type, but this is also one of their chiefest weaknesses  their partner may very much need these things, and it won't even occur to INTPs to plan them out. For all their analysis and attempts at mutual understanding, INTPs are notoriously bad at picking up on others' emotional needs. * Prescription: **Get more unpredictable and spontaneous in your life, and let it translate into your dating. Write down your Bucket List.** * Prescription: **Read up on date logistics, understand the concept of changing venues.** * Prescription: **Again, work on your Emotional Intelligence.** &gt; When it comes to conflict, there is a certain willful ignorance for INTPs, and they often set aside their partners' feelings, and their own, for far too long. * Prescription: **Get into the habit of calling out the elephant in the room more often.** &gt; When these conflicts do arise and are inescapable, INTPs will do their best to find a logical solution. But this hardly helps if the problem is logic itself, that INTP personalities aren't meeting their partners' emotional needs. INTPs should keep this in mind, and try to meet their partners halfway by communicating on an emotional level  if they make this effort, understanding partners will recognize and appreciate the gesture, clumsy though it may be. After all, they need to afford INTPs the same benefit, and meet them halfway with logic and simplicity as well. * Prescription: **Learn about female psychology, shit tests and drama.** * Prescription: **Do not treat her words literally.** &gt; All this material asceticism and conflict avoidance support one primary goal  to free up mental resources for more important things. INTPs' creative, vivid imagination make for a surprisingly enthusiastic, passionate, and romantic partner. While INTPs may prioritize their inner world too much, imagining interesting and exciting intimate situations that are never expressed to their partners, they also use this rich inner world to achieve as much as possible in intimacy  they rarely want for ideas. * Prescription: **Your rich inner world is what sets you apart. Share it with her and show it.** &gt; Physically, intellectually and with a little effort emotionally, INTP relationships are rich and rewarding connections. Partners who share the Intuitive (N) trait are usually best, along with one or two opposite traits to create variety and balance, but so long as INTPs remember that they are with people who have their own, independent wants and needs, and so long as their partners remember the same of their INTPs, these are long-lasting and satisfying relationships. * Prescription: **Beware of your own solipsism. The fact that you feel some way, doesn't mean she feels the same.** ***** # Friendships &gt; Many of the usual motivations for making friends  emotional support, social validation, shared routine  simply don't apply to INTPs. More likely, these concepts are met with disdain, as people with the INTP personality type prize intellectual depth above all else. It is not easy to become good friends with INTPs, but if there is a common interest and a common train of thought, the connection is likely to spark instantly, surprising everyone else who thought they had this distant personality type pegged. * Prescription: **Keep in mind people's need for emotional support, validation and shared routine. Satisfy it to win friends.** * Prescription: **Read *How to win friends and influence people*.** * Prescription: **Get more involved and closer with people you don't have much intellectual understanding or connection with.** &gt; INTP friendships are knowledge-based, defined by the exchange of ideas, theories, and concepts, and those who aren't able to keep up with this, or who have sharply differing tastes (don't talk to INTPs about celebrities) will find stony faces that border on rude. To INTPs, communication is often more of a nuisance than a pleasure, and conversation is reserved for topics that they find meaningful, or for people they already like enough to stick it out. &gt; &gt; Unless there's a natural affinity for this intellectual style, few have the patience to try to penetrate their shields, and INTPs are left with a naturally small circle of good friends. * Prescription: **Make smalltalk with [everyone](URL * Prescription: **Participate in conversations you consider pointless (weather, pop culture, cuisine, etc.)** * Prescription: **Talk to intellectually inferior people. Find aspects of those conversations you enjoy.** &gt; Other Analyst (NT) types are a natural fit for INTPs, who share their passion for new ideas, riddles and solutions. People with the INTP personality type are knowledgeable and intelligent, and have a great deal of respect for those who can keep them on their toes in this regard. They will gladly help to tackle any dilemma thrown their way, offering up sound advice and rational solutions. As valuable as these qualities are though, they are not always the best approach  when it comes to emotional support or advice in dealing with matters of the heart, INTPs are at a loss. * Prescription: **Don't give advice unless asked for.** * Prescription: **Even when asked for advice, consider whether logical solution is being requested.** &gt; It's not that INTP personalities don't feel  quite the contrary, they actually have very strong sentiments. But Feeling (F) is one of INTPs' least developed traits, making their emotional reactions strong, untrustworthy and naturally in need of being tempered by their well-trained logic and rationalism. Still waters run deep. * Prescription: **Learn to tame and control your emotions.** (Again, *Gorilla Mindset* is a good book on that) * Prescription: **Develop male friendships, for emotional support.** &gt; While they may not be able to help directly with these sorts of problems, INTPs help indirectly with unambiguous and reliable friendships. INTPs' friends need never worry about power games or emotional baggage  they are liked for their minds and abilities, not their status or possessions. While it may not be easy to establish true friendships with INTP personalities, once the link is made, they will provide years of understanding and thought-stimulating ideas, making them well worth the effort. * Prescription: **Examine the list of your friends. Do you keep some around for their intellectual abilities, even though they hold you back from improvement? Cut them out.** * Prescription: **Again, seek connection with intellectually inferior people, who are successful in life.** ***** # Career &gt; INTPs are solitary, eccentric, and independent  none of which is listed as desirable for corporate positions, which are usually designed for very different personality types. INTPs duly struggle in finding careers that meet their needs, but what they do bring, qualities in much higher demand, are creativity, a passion for theoretical methods and ideas, and an entrepreneurial, innovative spirit. If they are able to put this better foot forward to secure a position in a suitable line of work, people with the INTP personality type will find that, whatever the job listing says, these ""less desirable"" qualities will prove an asset after all. * Prescription: **Become a team-player, behave like others and listen to others' advice.** &gt; Chief among INTPs' interests is exploring and building models for underlying principles and ideas, even going so far as to find these concepts, in their own way, beautiful  this makes them natural mathematicians, systems analysts, and career scientists, especially in more abstract fields such as physics. There are many other careers that allow INTPs to explore these interests, but many of them are far too rooted in uninteresting practical applications. As useful as it is to develop a better vacuum cleaner, it is no Large Hadron Collider. * Prescription: **Appreciate practical problems. Train yourself to find something interesting in those.** * Prescription: **Consider career in STEM.** * Prescription: **Balance it with hobbies and activities that expose you to social interactions.** &gt; INTP personalities are self-driven and have very high personal standards  ""good enough"" is never good enough  but have few environmental needs. Despite this relative simplicity, they are often hard for more people-centric types to understand. INTPs live primarily in their own heads, and have little interest in social distractions like chitchat and motivational speeches. &gt; All INTPs really want is to immerse themselves in an interesting project, and anything that interrupts that, be it overactive managers, the need to manage others, or office parties or meetings, are simply unwelcome burdens. * Prescription: **Give up on your perfectionism. Learn to be OK with things being good enough.** * Prescription: **Evaluate your pursuits. If they don't have much value other than intellectual challenge, consider cutting them out.** * Prescription: **Find appreciation for chit-chat and other social interactions.** &gt; For this reason, the flatter the workplace hierarchy, the better, making small, technical workplaces and fields such as law, forensics, and laboratory research very desirable for INTPs. Insightful and open-minded managers who can accommodate these needs will find their INTP subordinates to be a tireless generator of brilliant and unique ideas. However, many people with the INTP personality type may do away with the immediate hierarchy altogether, opting instead to provide their services on a freelance basis as consultants. * Prescription: **Become your own boss. It will make you feel better.** &gt; Where INTPs do not thrive is in workplaces that require them to provide a high degree of emotional satisfaction  cruise ship masseuses they are not. INTP personalities struggle to understand emotional exchanges, and service-oriented positions will prove baffling and exhausting for them. Though INTPs are talented analysts who are perfectly capable of understanding the theoretical importance of customer service, the day-to-day application of such a scheme is simply better left to more people-oriented personality types. * Prescription: **Work on your understanding of emotional exchanges. Improve your interpersonal and emotional intelligence. *How to win friends and influence people*.** * Prescription: **Build endurance for those kinds of situations.** &gt; Business is growing more complex every day, and this complexity is managed with technical systems, economic theories, and data. The need for novel approaches is stronger than ever for people and organizations to distinguish themselves. Though general people skills are often phrased as a must, it is the technical work that creates something to talk about, and it is in this pursuit that INTPs thrive. * Prescription: **Work on your people skills.** &gt; Work as business analysts and corporate strategists is well suited to INTPs, but they can also move things forward as data analysts, mechanical, electrical and software engineers, and even as technical writers and journalists, provided the field is interesting enough. If they can smile and shake hands just long enough to establish themselves as the brilliant innovators that they are, people with the INTP personality type will find that whatever the expectations for social conduct, it is the qualities unique to them that are truly in demand. * Prescription: **Build endurance for following social conventions. Attend social functions more.** ***** # Workplace *In the first comment, due to the size limit.* ***** # Lessons learned ## Inner Game 1. Get comfortable with being more ordinary. Keep in mind that rationality, knowledge and intelligence are not objectively superior to other skills and traits. Learn to appreciate other skills in people, especially those intellectually inferior to you. Examine the list of your friends. Do you keep some around for their intellectual abilities or originality, even though they hold you back from improvement? Cut them out. 2. Confront your perfectionism and desire to innovate. Learn to be happy with things being good enough. Learn to value effort and struggle more over perfection. Desensitize yourself to failure and fear of failure by taking up endeavours with low success chance. 3. Believe in yourself more. Have more trust in yourself and your ability to perform well, especially in the face of unknown. Get more unpredictable and spontaneous in your life. Write down your Bucket List. 7. Learn to tame and control your emotions. Learn to be comfortable being single. ## Work Ethic 1. When you know you will have to make a decision or commit, set a hard deadline for yourself to make it. Feel free to use any reminders, TODO apps, etc. Get more organized. Have a schedule, stick to it. 3. In virtually all areas of life, success is achieved by long, mundane hustle; not sudden breakthroughs. Accept it. When feeling burned out and lacking motivation, try to find a new idea or perspective that might reignite your enthusiasm. 4. Evaluate challenges you choose to face. Are some of them going to bring low ROI, but you like them for the intellectual challenge? If so, drop them and invest your time more productively. Appreciate practical problems. Train yourself to find something interesting in those. Get more grounded (but how?) 5. Whenever starting a new endeavour, spend significant time observing, investigating and studying. This activity might be more beneficial for you than for other personality types. Learn focus and mindfulness. 9. Learn to be part of the team/mob/etc. Show more willingness to sacrifice your individuality and autonomy. Listen to others' advice. Follow existing rules. Even if they don't make much sense to you 12. Consider career in STEM. Become your own boss. Find someone in your workplace whom you can collaborate with. If managing a team, work with a person of great people skills. 4. Lift. ## Social skills 7. Observe empathetic people, social conventions they follow. Mimic them, even if it doesn't make much sense to you. Especially in highly emotional situations. Learn social conventions and respect them. Develop Emotional Intelligence (but how?). Work on your understanding of emotional exchanges. Build endurance for those kinds of situations. Speak as everyone else when you are not among people you can trust. Show some desire to be liked. If necessary, fake it. It will put people at ease to see this vulnerability in you. Get more involved and closer with people you don't have much intellectual understanding or connection with. Find aspects of those relationships that you enjoy. 1. Attend more social events, especially those where you don't know anybody. Assume they are friendly. If it seems otherwise, your perception might be wrong. Balance your (probably) technical work with hobbies and activities that expose you to social interactions. 4. Only give advice when asked for it. Even when asked for advice, consider whether logical solution is being requested. Take note whether you offer your advice too cheaply. Maybe you don't benefit from it and it only takes your time. Maybe you could start charging for it. Or use it for negotiating higher salary. 6. When talking to another person and your higher or at least equal status has been already established, leverage your controversial, non-reactive honesty to boost your status further. 12. Develop male friendships. ## Communication skills 1. With people you don't know, talk less. Say things only when you are certain of your message and the way you convey it. 5. When with friends, express yourself more freely, err on the side of mumbling about your inner thoughts and feelings. Practice telling made-up stories, exaggerating, while its understood what you are saying is not true. Err on the side of over-exaggerating your enthusiasm about ideas. 6. When attempting to explain something, have patience and willingness to walk the other person through your thinking. Practice analogy and metaphor. Practice with small kids. 2. When you get excited, consciously slow your speech down, use simpler terms, finish your train of thought before moving on, make sure you were understood. Err on the side of sounding narcoleptic, patronising, and like a simpleton. 7. Make smalltalk with [everyone](URL Participate in conversations you consider pointless (weather, pop culture, cuisine, etc.) ## Pussy 1. To leverage your intellect and wit, focus your efforts on sarging during the day, online or in lounges, as opposed to loud venues at night. 3. Desensitize yourself to rejection. Accept your responsibility to lead. Keep persisting even after previous rejections. Be careful not to overinvest. Show less excitement than you really feel. Especially when you meet someone you click really well with. Learn about female psychology, shit tests and drama. Beware of your own solipsism. The fact that you feel some way, doesn't mean she feels the same. 6. Learn to be funny and less serious when dating. Let your increased spontaneity translate to your dating life. Read up on date logistics, understand the concept of changing venues. 7. Remember that until you have both committed to each other, you have no obligation towards your date. Remember also, that she's probably spinning plates. ## Reading List * Gorilla Mindset * The New Psycho-Cybernetics * How to Win Friends and Influence People * Cocky Comedy and Other Conversational Skills "
110,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Ignorant to my own Alpha actions,220,4dskgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4dskgh/ignorant_to_my_own_alpha_actions/,2016-04-08 05:00:11,"TL;DR TRP way of living has only recently become embraced I'm in my late 20's. I dated a woman that works at a bar I frequent for about a year. I ride a motorcycle and am a good-looking guy so it wasn't difficult to pick her up. Things started out well. I did my thing, she did hers and we went out every now and again and hooked up often. Then she started to get emotional and manipulated me a bit to open up to her. I didn't ""open up"" to her for nearly a year. I did the things I love and she was into me for that because I was in control. I made the decisions and she went along with what made me happy because that made her happy. Those are literally her words, not mine. Without thinking I caved into the emotional rope pull. I am a veteran and was in the parachute infantry. I served in Afghanistan and Iraq. I saw/did many things that I do not discuss with, quite frankly, anyone. She basically begged me to tell her why I am a bit distant, unemotional, stubborn, small group of friends type of person. I didn't spill my guts to her but I told her these dark things and it turned into me telling her that I cared a lot about her and had strong feelings for her. A few days later I made a decision to stop seeing her because her knowing those things made me feel entirely too vulnerable. And feeling vulnerable is not something I take well. It mentally puts me back into situations I was in overseas.....the feeling of vulnerability. Whether it be physically, mentally or what have you. I stopped by her house and broke down a little (first mistake). I got emotional (second mistake). I cried (third mistake). Ended up *not* breaking it off with her because she was supportive and bawling and asking me to stay in her life (final mistake). Throughout the next two weeks I didn't hear much from her. She even blew me off on a couple nights we were supposed to hang out. Then finally, ""I don't think we should see each other anymore. I'm unsure of where I stand right now blah blah blah."" I was heartbroken. I was torn up because I shared things that I can't even share with my own father. It wasn't about her breaking it off, it was about me sharing deep, solo, shit about my life and then her leaving very quickly afterwards. After a week I did not contact her. I didn't answer her calls or texts. I went back to what I was doing before, being Alpha without even realizing it. I took a 2 week long trip on my motorcycle...didn't bring my cell phone. I slept on the sides of roads with a pup tent set off the side of my bike. By the time I got back I ended up with ~4000 miles ridden. Best two weeks of my life. I started getting back into metalworking (I'm a welder). Making things out of metal from flowers to wine racks to motorcycle trailers. I love turning scrap metal into artwork. It's extremely satisfying. I started reading about WW2 fighter pilots again which has always been one of my biggest passions and interests. Those guys were the definition of TRP. Men being men and not giving a fuck about what people thought of them. I've always looked up to Hans Marseille and recommend his book. One of the original red pillers if you ask me. I always hit the gym but started hitting it harder than before. Making hard progress quickly. We have mutual friends and obviously she heard about all these things because that's simply how the grapevine works. I really dig this girl so I decided to stop back in that same bar. I hadn't been in since we stopped seeing one another. We also hadn't talked in quite a long time. I'd venture to say 10 months after the breakup. She was there and I gave her a friendly, nonchalant hello. Sat down drank my beer. I was leaving and she ran out to my bike, told me she had a 15 minute break and to ""take me somewhere away from here quick"". Obviously the rest is history. I have only discovered TRP recently. I've lurked here for about a month. Only now did I realize how I was acting. It never occurred to me to embrace this way. I was raised in a household with my mother and two sisters. I was the man of the house and mostly acted as such when I was of age. But being Alpha was only really embraced while I was in the military. This isn't the first time this situation has happened to me. Any time I open up or get emotional with women is when things begin to go downhill whether I realize it or not. I was married once...stupidest mistake of my young life. Won't go into detail but I will say she fucked some guy while I was deployed (shocking I know /s). I can say every time I embrace my masculinity and being a man is the only time I can be happy with a woman. I don't cave into ""feeling"". It's not that I don't care for the women I'm with or don't have feelings but I try to never let it be the #1 thing in my life. I concentrate on myself and let the women in my life enjoy the ride. If they don't like it, the exit is always open. Only now, after having discovered TRP do I realize how effective living my life this way can truly be. I've been seeing this same woman for 5 months now and things are great. She wants sex more than I do FFS. We're back to how things were before I let myself get all emo. I don't let myself get tied up with emotions. I stay true to myself and she compliments me all the time for it. I did reciprocate ""I love you."" because I do love her. But I don't believe in being ""in love"" and especially do not believe in ""needing"" someone. I made that fully clear to her. It surprised her and yet she still embraced it. Some of you guys may disagree with the whole ""love"" part but I think I've found a happy balance with it. I'm simply not a full blown red piller. I always stay true to myself though, regardless of how involved I am with a woman. I'm glad I got a marriage and divorce out of the way because it taught me that exact life long lesson. I just wanted to share this with you guys. Thought at least some may enjoy it. I welcome negative and positive thoughts. I know not everyone will find this to be Red Pill material. Biggest lesson I've learned is to never let a woman take priority of what I truly want/need to make myself happy. Thanks for reading."

Talk about your vulnerability and pay lip service to the female collective. Say She protects me and is protective of me when I am having a hard time."". Say you cant control your feelings. Say that the woman is in control of the relationship and women will let you off as you are helping them in a way (""if a Hollywood actor is dominated by a 19 year old student then surely I can take charge against my husband - better not fight this..."") 2. Get your positive PR done and released to the public before any negative PR is done. First impressions count and frame the readers/publics minds into your view. All future articles the readers read they will compare it to the mental framework they made in this first one. Usually what is said first sticks much better. 3. It is important that you met them spontaneously in your story. You never were on the lookout for a younger woman. 4. ""Henry has admitted that from the first moment he met Tara he has been super intimidated and desperate to impress her."" - his PR agency is amazing. I never would have considered this. I guess an easy trick to mimic this would be to imagine you are the girl and the girl is the Hollywood actor and just say you felt how she felt, and she felt how you felt. Edit: my point is not about being able to date girls. Its about being destroyed in the press/media/social circles. This is a strategy to protect yourself"
112,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Why most of today's women aren't worthy of your commitment.,314,4fw907,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4fw907/why_most_of_todays_women_arent_worthy_of_your/,2016-04-22 11:25:57,"[Full Post here, READ IT](URL Excerpt: If you're Machiavellian and understand women you will have no problem managing female bullshit. The real problem I think is most guys find the cherry just isn't sweet enough. That's to say, although YOU COULD manage her YOU'RE JUST NOT SUFFICIENTLY INCENTIVISED TO DO SO. Most women aren't worth the extra effort, simply enough. They take more than they give. For access to a vagina you have to: - Have her put all her worries and stress on you - Listen to her boring, empty, vapid social observations - Deal with her whining/being menstrual/insecure - Deal with her crazy whenever it rears its's head And you have to deal with all that like a champ, stoically, because if you lose frame too much the relationship is fucked and she doesn't even want you anymore even though she's, to be quite blunt: an insufferable cunt. You pay so much in spirit and mental energy being in a relationship with a woman. Pussy can be had cheaper. If women have shit personalities, why do you want relationships with them? Most women have absolutely no personality that makes them worth commitment. What women don't seem to understand, flying off auto-pilot on their looks in youth, is that a hot tight body only attracts men, it doesn't keep them around. She will lose her beauty. You actually need to be mildly interesting and/or good-natured to be relationship material. So what do we do? We fuck and chuck. Don't get me wrong, I think a lot of men would like a family - but it has to be with the right woman. Not a dim, boring, narcissistic empty shell of a human-being. Personally I rather never reproduce than put my children through the pain of being raised by a stupid, horrible, whiny self-entitled woman. I don't even care if she's good to the kids, if she's a cunt to me the kids will see that and it will affect them detrimentally. That's not how I imagine raising a family, you either DO IT RIGHT or you don't bother doing it at all. LTRs should be mother material - most women nowadays aren't mothers because they deserve to be, but simply because they stopped taking their birth control. Too many whores are fucking dragging kids up nowadays, not raising them right - and that's why we have all the problems we do in society. Millennials are a mess because of divorce and single mothers. I don't want to put my kids through that bullshit. If she puts herself above family, she's not a woman I ever see as anything other than a hole to be used for my momentary leisure. **Not only is the reward lower, but the effort necessary is higher. So you're playing on a higher difficulty for a lower prize.** - You have to be vigilant, you can't let your guard down or give into your kindness, because she will exploit it and see you as less for ""showing weakness."" - You have less sexual options than if you were single, this one woman is controlling your sexual preferences, and then she'll play games where she doesn't put out to control you. Basically, bitches weaponise your libido against you and then force you to listen to their feelings if you cant sufficiently dread/headfuck them. But if you stray to get your release then it's not her fault, it's yours, you're the evil one. - She knows you better so she's better at head fucking you. She'll press all your buttons, say shit plates wouldn't know. Say some shit about your mother, say some shit you told her about your childhood. Whatever. Basically any fucking thing you think is sacred she's going to use against you to ""test you"" and also because bitches are just plain crazy and hormonal and are going to lash out at some point. She's meant to be a partner but you can't even properly open up to her without her abusing that shit. And it's not a matter of IF, it's a matter of WHEN. - Likewise as she knows you better she's more immune to your techniques/strategies/mannerisms. She will become immune to different gambits/coping mechanisms you use like a fucking disease growing resistant to antibiotics. So you need to change your shit up or it'll all fall apart. - You have to keep reinventing yourself and being inconsistent, or she gets bored and looks elsewhere for cock on the side. Society/her family will support her in this and she'll just rationalise you're a cunt. - You don't really get a break. You don't get to let your guard down. Because if you do she freaks out and fucks off. Momentary vulnerability can only be superficial/aesthetic in nature. If you're LEGITIMATELY VULNERABLE she will dry up and abandon you. So the work you put in IS IMMEASURABLE and the reward is negligible. It's a terrible investment. --- Discuss"
113,vulnerability,TheRedPill,"Vital Lies: TRP, Culture, and Existentialism",45,49428o,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/49428o/vital_lies_trp_culture_and_existentialism/,2016-03-06 07:34:13," ###The Existential Dilemma At some point, the child realizes he is not omnipotent. In fact, he is as far from omnipotent as can be. His very survival and well-being is predicated on the whims of an external Other, on parents, society, and nature. His seemingly godlike consciousness is enclosed in a pathetic bag of skin that burps and shits. The body represents the fact of his own mortality, that he is a physical object subject to determinism, decay and death. He lacks authority even over his own body. Existence is incomprehensible to him. Billions of individual organisms with appetites of all kinds surround him. Each thing, in order to expand, is gobbling up and destroying others. The destructive, unconscious power of nature, of earthquakes and hurricanes, threatens to tear his body apart. There exists a constant danger of a slip-up, an accident, a chance disease, and of course death, the total submergence and negation. He doesn't know who he is, why he was born, what he is doing on this planet, what he is supposed to do, what he can expect. To be fully aware and conscious of the reality of his situation is to render the individual useless. The anxiety and confusion inherent in acknowledging his predicament is overwhelming and leaves him feeling truly impotent. In order to function in life, it is necessary that he suppress this awareness as much as possible. Thus, we develop the two vital lies of character and of culture in order to repress our awareness of reality. The more confident, successful, arrogant an individual is, the more he has succeeded in repressing his own thoughts. We say he is ""naturalized,"" but really we mean unnaturalized, falsified, truth obscured, the despair of the human condition hidden. This repression sometimes spills out into our daytime phobias and neuroses, but we build a defense against this despair which allows us a basic sense of self-worth, meaningfulness, and power. ###The Vital Lie of Character Our lifestyle is a vital lie. It is a necessary and basic dishonestly about oneself and ones whole situation. This is what the Freudian revolution in thought really ends up in and is the basic reason that we still strain against Freud today. We don't want to admit what we don't want to admit: that we are dishonest about reality, that we do not really control our lives, that we do not stand alone, that we always rely on something that transcends us, some system of ideas which support us. We lose ourselves in an absorbing activity, a passion, a dedication to a game or a way of life, which serves to keep the individual ignorant of himself. Sexual conquests, a national flag, the fetish of money and the size of a bank balance, all serve to distract and engage the individual in activity, insulated from self-reflection. In this light, we can begin to understand the *drivenness* of man. He is driven *away* from himself, from self-knowledge, self-reflection. He is driven towards the vital lie of his character. We at TRP fashion for ourselves a false self, an ""ideal man,"" and we strive to become this ideal man, this mask of power and control. We tell ourselves we are finding ourselves, rather than fleeing ourselves, and this is our protection from existential anxiety and dread. If the human body represents decay, death, and our subjection to determinism, then we attempt to subvert these facts by seeking control and sovereignty over the body. *""LIFT.""* It is ironic how the lie we need in order to live also dooms us to a life that is never really ours, though we convince ourselves it is ours. We take on the values and the meaning of the society in which we live. Despite how ""blue-pill"" our society is, it still ingrains in us the power and meaning inherent in wealth and sexual conquest, especially for men. A virgin male is something to be despised, shamed; thus the virgin male is further from the protective immortality of social acceptance, and subject to death. The individual's neurotic fear of social rejection is not a fear of rejection itself, it is a fear of a fundamental vulnerability which leads to death. The child knows it's life and well-being are completely dependent on an Other, and thus the relationship to the Other must be maintained at all costs. We carry this awareness within us always, though it may be subconscious. We recognize that social isolation is suicide. ###The Vital Lie of Culture Society everywhere is a living myth of the significance of human life, a defiant creation of meaning. Every society is thus a ""religion"" whether it thinks so or not. In the case of death, we know the battle cannot be won in the physical world. Thus, we are forced to turn away from the physical world and seek victory in the symbolic. We invest ourselves in the symbols handed down to us by culture and religion. We identify with them, see ourselves in them, and instead of trying to live on literally we instead try to make sure our symbols of immortality, culture, religion, are seen as powerful and durable. Work, family, nation, legacy, DNA... we cling to a symbolic representation of meaning and immortality to cope with the fear of death. Thus we take on a collective sense of immortality in order to transcend individual death. The purpose of culture is to help us deal with our knowledge of our own mortality by granting us a sense of meaning. Our culture defines the ""good life,"" and we try to excel at it. We try to distinguish ourselves, stand out as special; heroism is the means by which we attempt to transcend the limits of our own mortality. Brick and stone is not just brick and stone, but a symbol of achievement, triumph, and permanence. Wealth is not just wealth, it is a symbolic barrier against death. Sex is not just sex, it is a symbolic representation of conquest and power. It is only through a culturally constructed sense of reality that we know what it means to be a valuable or important figure. In American culture, if you can stuff a rubber ball through a metal hoop you are a genius, and we can pay you millions of dollars, and your immortality will be assured in history... but in other cultures such behavior would be considered worthless. Thus we see the rather arbitrary nature of our constructions of meaning and purpose. The crises of modern society is precisely that the youth no longer feel heroic in the plan for action that their culture has set up. Religion is no longer valid as a hero system, and thus the youth scorn it. The minority groups who shout for freedom and human dignity are really clumsily asking that they be given a sense of primary heroism of which they have been cheated historically. ###Catch-22 Freud summed it up beautifully when he remarked that psychoanalysis cured the neurotic misery in order to introduce the patient to the common misery of life. ""Neurosis"" is another word for describing a complicated technique for avoiding misery, but reality is the misery. What then ought we do? If our lies are vital and necessary to function in society, should we really reveal their nature and tear them down? Or should we support and maintain our lies as much as possible? Should we return to an age of traditionalism when our cultural constructions held profound meaning for the members of society, and instill our games and lies in our children as early and as fervently as possible? The individual who feels his lies truly are vital will of course reject this knowledge entirely. He will call it pseudo-intellectual nonsense and move on with his life of culturally constructed meaning. His life will be one directed towards maximizing self-esteem and confidence as a bulwark against death. And we can wish him the best of luck in this endeavor, for it may be the proper one indeed. Once a man has awoken, it is hard to fall back to sleep. In the teachings of the Buddha or the Stoics we can see men with full awareness of the human condition, and an attempt at transcending the basic fact of human suffering. A man who is willing to embrace the reality of the human condition will eventually reach the state of mind common in those who have gone through an Alcoholics Anonymous program. He knows he will never be ""cured,"" but he can reach something resembling a cure, if only he lives with humility."
114,vulnerability,TheRedPill,"Be wary of the Disney fairytale relationships fed to you and/or your children, and the intentionally vague future left for your imagination to unfold.",50,49ezfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/49ezfp/be_wary_of_the_disney_fairytale_relationships_fed/,2016-03-08 08:45:50,"**Summary** - Disney movies and other forms of childhood fictional media portray an inaccurate and intentionally obtuse illustration of prince charming's future. It is no coincidence that blank pages follow after the ""happily-ever-after"" departure we're left with at the end of these films. Do not fall for this and be the guy who sacrifices everything for the princess locked away in the tower. - - - **Body** Despite your sex, upbringing, financial circumstance, parents, or any other context you've been raised within, you more than likely have had Disney shoved down your throat. While not all Disney films follow the same philosophy, they generally imitate a framework for a hard-to-believe prince/princess relationship dynamic with an intentionally vague future left open to interpretation. As we're young, media's influence, like most other forms of information, is much greater than as adults. It's not simply entertainment for us as children, but an immersive experience where we often discover the foundation of our belief structure. Like many other forms of entertainment, things told to us on television, be it the news or fictional cartoons, are propagated in such a way that either things told are a flat out lie, or are presented in such a way that dismisses all negative aspects and serves as a highlight reel of naive positivity. - - - Consider your typical Disney movie -- it generally follows a generic theme. The princess is usually trapped away by your typical villain until Prince Charming comes along to save the day. At the beginning of the movie, the princess may even look down upon him and his beta ways. Perhaps he's poor, or there's higher status men that naturally captivate without having to do ""favors"" or ""win"" the love of the girl. By the end of the movie, the prince rescues the princess, they kiss, and live happily ever after... ...or do they? Given the fictional element of all, there's no way of telling. However, we consume the same form of delivery through our social media and general gossip -- everything seems perfect from the exterior. The intricacies of the relationship are dismissed for a generalized, easy-to-digest half-truth for the public where everything's hunky-dory, even if quintessential relationship and gender dynamics aren't in play. We've seen over and over again how you cannot sustain an LTR strictly through only alpha and only beta qualities, but what we *do* see in the films we've grown up with is the same thing we see here about TRP, the ""beta male"" finally doing something heroic, but putting everything he has on the line for some broad in hopes that *maybe* something would come out of it. - - - Now, this is obviously not always the case. There are alpha male figures illustrated in cartoons and childhood movies, but they are few and far between when compared to the enormous amount of betas who have done one heroic act with the assumption of reward. To stimulate a positive correlation between sacrificing everything for a woman and reward, they leave everything after the ""happily ever after"" up to interpretation. This, essentially, acts as brainwash when we lack the critical thinking skills as children to fill in the blanks of the would-be vague outset to follow. Does the princess get fat and entitled? Does the man slave away because the woman sees his ""sweet"" qualities and pinpoints an emotional weakness ripe for exploitation? Does the male get lazy and complacent if he *becomes* alpha because the prize is already won? Does the prince born of nobility and riches get divorce-raped because of the resources on the table and the charm of the initial heroic deed has worn off? (Probably not because of the context of the films and the periods of time they take in which enforced marriage to work, hah!) It's all up to interpretation. It would be a bold claim to say that Walt Disney created these movies with propaganda in mind, but we can learn to fill in the blanks for our present and future seed and tell them the truth of the matter with women, lest they be exploited and thrown to the dirt by some future woman. There's a reason sequels hardly ever focus on these things or don't exist -- we all know human nature prevents ""happily ever after"" from occurring. We all know analogous stories in real life where the macho guy gets complacent, or has too much of a soft spot, or is too relentlessly trusting, and gets exploited for the one chink in his armor. We also have beta friends we know who did one valiant act to win over the heart of a girl, which essentially became deception once the girl found out that wasn't consistent activity. How's that relationship going now? Do not let your future children fall into the trap of believing the relationship dynamic through the narrative of Disney fairytales. If you're here and have read the sidebar, hopefully I don't have to tell you to do the same. If you're already in this situation, you better find an exit strategy and make sure you can move on in life the instant some bitch drops you. - - - ##Lessons Learned: * Always think one step ahead, rather than get surprised when you were text-book chivalrous and your chick leaves you or gets bored of you. * Do not, under any circumstances, get complacent once you've achieved something, especially an LTR. * Women are the masterminds of deception, deception is rarely the right tool to use against them. They will smell through your bullshit and one-off acts. Maybe not immediately, but with time. * Fortify the chinks in your armor or cover it up well -- any vulnerability can and will be scoped out by women (hell, or anyone) and set you up for exploitation. * Don't be a shitty parent and let your future son get divorce-fucked or let your future daughter fall into the increasingly entitled society that most girls in the west exhibit. Make sure they understand the truth when they begin to question these things. * Do *not* be that fucking guy that gives up everything in some heroic act to win a girl's heart. I don't give a shit if they are an HB10 and the best lay you've ever gotten. It's never worth it. Build up yourself and let them come to *you*. Protect your assets, do not throw away what you've built for yourself. * If something is suspiciously missing from a story - whether it be politics, films, social media stories, or your own life - question it. Think outside the box and escape spoon-fed bullshit narratives that tell you to battle against your gut instincts. Remember: [""You're here because you know something. What you know you can't explain -- but you feel it. You've felt it your entire life. There's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.""](URL"

I think you guys will enjoy it, especially those who struggle to read my usual denser, lengthier prose. I'll leave 25 maxims here, [**with a further 43 (68 total) available on my blog.**](URL Enjoy! --- 1.  Hijacking is a special kind of Machiavellianism, for it wears the agenda of another whilst pursuing its own, like a metaphorical Russian doll, it hides an agenda within an agenda. 2.  Read between the lines, if you can deduce why somebody is asking a question and you do not like the reasoning for their question, do not deign an answer. Ignore or dismiss traps, do not fall into them. 3.  When someone attempts to undermine rather than refute you, theyre the enemy. 4.  Undermining is personal, refutation isnt. Refutation communicates I believe youre wrong due to the findings of the available evidence. Undermining communicates Im going to humiliate you because your opinions invoke my disdain. Refutations are logical retorts, undermining is interrelational violence. Learn to distinguish between the two, for they oft appear similar. 5.  Bending the rules is no more than the abuse of technicality to circumvent the spirit of the rule without violating its letter. 6.  Love doesnt conquer psychopathy. 7.  Only pick fights thatll yield profit; pettiness will erode your credibility, fighting on many fronts will exhaust you. 8.  The crab bucket mentality is pervasive, a jealous friend is a betrayal waiting to happen. Know when to cut the gangrenous limb, do not allow the sentimental nostalgia to sustain poisonous ties. 9.  If you are drawn into something emotionally, the odds of damaging your reputation and engaging in regrettable acts exponentially increases. 10.  Many arrogant men believe anger is the safe emotion they can display without real consequence, this belief is folly. Man should endeavour to be mindful, for this will allow him to rein in unruly emotion. 11.  He who does not control his emotions is puppeteered by them. Strict adherence to emotional data is tactical death, whilst ignoring emotion idiotic, and suppressing it tiresome. As such, emotion should be channelled, not ignored or obeyed. 12.  On national anniversaries of loss or celebration, people are at their most vulnerable. It is at times of heightened cultural emotivity that reflection takes root in the mediocre, and filled with regret, the populace is at their most manipulable. 13.  Self-deprecation builds trust, when people see even minor imperfections, theyre endeared by the transparency. 14.  People are susceptible to negativity bias, if something is negative, it is more likely to be believed without rigorous investigation. Acts of virtue come with a burden of proof, acts of unvirtue do not. 15.  Appear easily provoked, then ignore those who see it as an opportunity to attack; this is good for enticing the lurking foe to reveal himself. Present an illusion of disordered vulnerability, seduce an attack, and by the time your foe realises the ruse it is too late, he has revealed himself. 16.  An effective strategist knows when to utilise counterintuitive gambits to get a better view of the battlefield. For example, if you are strong in one area, make your enemy think you are weak. If you are weak in an area, make your enemy think you are strong. If you confuse the enemys data points, he cannot successfully analyse you. If he cannot analyse you, he cannot defeat you. 17.  Be wary the plausible deniability of jokes, its just a joke is the most common phrase used to disguise a transgression. All good jokes contain truth, as such if one crosses your boundaries under the guise of humour, they are still trespassing, humour but smoke and mirrors for such trespass. 18.  He who acts boldly under the cloak of sadistic humour is not to be trusted, for humour is the jesters shield and sword. 19.  People who get caught doing something they shouldnt do not reveal the complete truth at once. they opt to reveal the least self-incriminating aspects first. 20.  The objective of trickle truth is damage control, to minimise the damage done to ones reputation when a loss of reputation is all but unavoidable. 21.  As lies compound, trust erodes, and the more difficult it becomes to lie. The more it is perceived that you lie, the better you must be at lying to successfully do so. As such, compulsive lying is tactically unsound  lie only when necessary. 22.  Trust can be earned and spent, but if you spend too much too quickly, your account with the betrayed individual is permanently closed, no matter what you do, you will always be spent. 23.  People love to be seduced, but they do not like to know how. Honesty doesnt pay when transparency compromises the beauty of the illusion that sustains you. Like any magic trick, people enjoy the perception of mystery, not what creates it. 24.  Apply seduction to romance or sales, never reveal your tricks. Give your pitch, not your essence. 25.  Effortlessness and dismissiveness foster an appearance of strength. --- **FULL ARTICLE: URL"

The most reliable sign, the most universal behavior of unscrupulous people is not directed, as one might imagine, at our fearfulness. It is, perversely, an appeal to our sympathy. &gt;I first learned this when I was still a graduate student in psychology and had the opportunity to interview a court referred patient...already identified as a psychopath.

117,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Going somewhere out of your element requires a different kind of Game [FR],0,3yo7r2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3yo7r2/going_somewhere_out_of_your_element_requires_a/,2015-12-30 04:01:07,"So, last week I had an FR about a girl (let's call her Kim) who I met off tinder, and f-closed in the same night, despite the fact that I had lost frame multiple times. And the overall consensus was many things, but among them being that I was lucky and stumbled into a ""fool's mate"" which is to say that I got lucky b/c the girl was into me either way. **TLDR: I went to a club to meet a girl who I already banged while she's out with her friends. I proceed to make several ""good"" moves in regards to displaying value, but then took dread game a little too far with a stranger** So, I flirt a little back and forth via snapchat over the weekend, and yesterday text her asking her plans for the evening (worth mentioning that she texted me earlier in the day saying we need to fuck soon). She invites me out to a club she's going to with her friends (I didn't realize it was a club at the time). I show up there around 11:30, I had already been drinking earlier with some of my friends, so I was in a social mood. Chatted up my uber driver, and just overall felt pretty good. Get there, hug her, meet her friends and social proof the fuck outta myself. I found her 3 female friends, 1 was unreceptive, 1 was flirtatious and I hit it off with her, and 1 was just really drunk already. I also met the guys in the group, befriended them, laughed etc. Danced a bit, and overall just enjoyed myself. I told Kim I was leaving, and I *think* she said she was ready to come with me (not sure, loud fucking club). I go to close the tab, as I do it, I spot a girl right next to me talking to some fella who bought her a drink. I casually make some comment, she and I hit it off in a 5 minute conversation, and I got her number...right in front of the male she was with. I sincerely doubt anything will happen with the number, I was just surprised I could even push the envelope that far. But Kim clearly saw me doing this, and as I go back I tell her I'm about to call the uber, and she says that she's going home. Before I even realize what happened, she's left the club and is on her way home. Outcome independence - and even if I am **not** OI, I gotta *fake it till I make it* and function will follow form right? I went back, danced with some random girl (next to Kim's two friends who I **didn't** hit it off with). I proceeded to give her my number (in front of them) and left the club. I'm about to call an uber and I run into Kim's male friends, they were headed back to X's place to smoke weed, and invited me along. I joined them, smoked/chilled for ~35 minutes, got invited to some NYE party they're hosting (free tickets from them). and then I left b/c I have work in the morning. One question about this, did I fuck up some social party etiquette by leaving early/suddenly? But anyways, I actually really like Kim, and on my way home from X's place, drunk dialed her - no answer (Hail Mary). Today, I intend to call her during my lunch break, schedule a desert/drinks meetup tonight or tomorrow (push for tonight). And at this meetup, I wanna address what happened. In summary, I kinda disrespected/embarrassed her in front of her friends by getting numbers from two other girls. BUT I will point out that when I did something as simple as try to grind on her she was VERY unreceptive (I'm guessing some friend induced ASD). So part of the reason I gamed the other chick is because I don't wanna be some cuck with no dread. I just finished reading *Models by Marc Manson* and in it, he advertises using the truth and being ""vulnerable"" as much as possible. I'm considering actually hitting Kim with some vulnerability in saying that she's the first person I feel an emotional connection with since my LTR that really fucked me up (which I had spoken to her a bit about during my first date - how the fuck I got laid, who knows). Is this poor form? I know she's gonna be at the NYE event in two days, but I'd rather have this taken care of before then. And yes, I'm aware that I am invested, but that's also due to the fact that this woman is *SIGNIFICANTLY* higher in quality compared to any of the plates I am currently spinning / have spun. And that said, I definitely wanna convert her into a plate because she showed many signs of great plate potential. The 3 main questions 1) did I fuck up party etiquette by leaving early 2) is my damage control plan a crash and burn waiting to happen or does it seem to have some logical/feasibility 3) did I push her away with too much dread or is what I did appropriate given that this is the second meetup (and on the first date, a guy gave her his number)"

Unfortunately many men accept this as gospel. Its part of their Blue Pill upbringing and is an essential aspect of their feminine sensitivity training and gender loathing conditioning. When masculinity is only ever a mask men wear the only thing real about them is what real women tell them it should be. What we dont consider is the legitimacy of our need for strength, independence, stoicism, and yes, emotional restraint. That need to be bulwark against womens emotionality, that need to wear psychological armor against the Red Pill realities of womens visceral natures is legitimate and necessary. If a mans vulnerability is ever its because his display of it is so uncharacteristic of his normal impenetrability. The womans demeanor, and the narrators voice, in the last posts Campbells soup commercial is an example of the weak, vulnerability women expect from lesser child-men  and a commensurate expectation of him to just get that he needs to be strong. Thats the inconsistency in womens Hypergamous nature and the narrative of the Feminine Imperatives messaging. Be sweet, open, vulnerable; its OK to cry, ask for help, be sick and weakened, were all equal and empathetic  but, Man Up, what, you need your mommy?, assert yourself, the asshole is sexier than you, wheres your self-discipline?  but, your masculine identity is a mask you wear to hide the real you, I play many roles in the male life I lead today, and Ive played many others in my past. Im Rollo Tomassi in the manosphere, Im a father to my daughter, a husband and lover to my wife, a brilliant artist and pragmatic builder of brands in my job, an adventure seeker when Im on my snowmobile and a quiet contemplator of life and God when Im fishing. All of those roles and more are as legitimate as I choose to make them. Do I have moments of uncertainty? Do I waiver in my resolve sometimes? Of course, but I dont let that define me because I know there is no real strength in relating that."
119,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Sexual Reality and How We Dismiss It,72,42eri3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/42eri3/sexual_reality_and_how_we_dismiss_it/,2016-01-24 16:44:11,"Original essay: [URL Dr. Apfelbaum is a psychologist in Berkeley CA, apparently specializing in sex therapy. He practices what is known as ""ego analytic therapy,"" which from my interpretation is basically amoral psychology. It's central tenet is to accept reality, our feelings about reality, and how we feel about our feelings. I'm going to dissect a few key parts from this particular essay, but I highly encourage reading the whole piece first to get the full message. The other essays Dr. Apfelbaum has posted on his [website](URL are also extremely insightful and you should check those out too. The purpose of this post is my fear that many of us have simply traded blue-pill fantasy for a red-pill fantasy (myself included). If TRP is about developing effective sexual strategies, it should be concerned with realities, not idealities. When it comes to crushing blue-pill thinking, it is very good at this, but when it comes to formulating a red-pill response, it often appeals to universal male fantasies and ideals rather than facts. All italics and emboldening are mine. Citations removed to improve readability, you can look them up in the original essay. &gt; Let's begin with the question facing our panel: *What is sex for?* The first answer that most people give is that **sex is for procreation.** Now suppose that we were to point out the unreality of this answer by suggesting that if the purpose of sex was procreation there would be no way to account for our experience of year 'round estrus since procreation is efficiently accomplished in infrahuman species even when limited to one month out of the year. A fair point, given the nature of my last post. I'll accept it. &gt; Our respondents would then undoubtedly go on to the next answer, that **sex is an expression of lovethe ultimate form of intimacy.** Suppose that we were then to remind them of the reality of tits and ass, inflatable dolls, spike heels and patent leather, as well as fanny pinching and the other varieties of rape and harassment. &gt; This would cause our respondents no difficulty, of course. They would simply reply (much as they would about homosexuality) that these are perversions of sex, in other words, distortions of sex rather than a manifestations of what sex really is. But perhaps realizing that this answer is a bit too dismissive, they might then fall back on a quite different answer, that **sex is for pleasure and relief from tension.** &gt; This would oblige us to point out that people do not eat bull's testicles or powdered rhinoceros horn to increase their capacity for tension release or sensual responsiveness (much less to achieve greater intimacy). We would call our respondent's attention to the real world in which ***sex is a test of adequacy, a test of virility for men and of warmth and responsiveness for women.*** The scorn expressed in the terms impotence and frigidity is reserved for those who fail to pass these tests. Sex-as-a-test is the most fundamental view of sex. Look at the language we use: sexual **performance**, sexual **ability**, sexual **prowess**, sexually **successful**, ""scoring,"" N count, **good** in bed, etc. As Dr. Apfelbaum states elsewhere, all those other views of sex are just the criteria on which the test is graded. &gt; Our respondents are engaging in a kind of mental trick. Without thinking about it they are making a distinction between the imperfect world of sexual experience and sex as a biological given that underlies and transcends this imperfect world . . . &gt; What we experience as biological sex is caused by our waking fantasies. What fatefully clouds our thinking about sex is the difficulty we all have in being able to distinguish between what is real in sex and what is fantasy. &gt; To illustrate the way our vision of sexual reality is shaped by our fantasies, an example from the thinking of our forebears will be more compelling just because their reality is now such a transparently naive projection. John Howard Van Amringe (Maeroff, 1984), a dean of Columbia College (an Ivy League school) in the late 19th century said in defense of the all-male private college: &gt; ""If you can teach mathematics to a boy when there's a girl in the room then there is something wrong with the boy."" &gt; To Dean Amringe sex was a biological imperative independent of the context. What makes this kind of conception so persistent is its imperviousness to negative instances. Even if all boys could be taught mathematics with girls in the room this might only raise a question about the virility of all boys, with the possible exception, of course, of those who fail mathematics. &gt; Now, as it happened, so many boys have learned mathematics with girls in the room, that we need to ask where Dean Amringe went wrong. *The answer is that he confused fantasy with reality.* He imagined what it would be like to be a boy in a coed college and this just seemed to him to be a highly erotic prospect. Fantasy is always exactly as we want it to be. In fantasy, we're always aroused, and our partners are always arousing. Anything potentially distracting or unattractive is ignored, it doesn't even show up. There are no setbacks or anxieties or second thoughts. If that's the sex we want (and expect to have someday), no wonder we want it all the time. &gt; It was Freud who offered the most sweepingly romantic modern version of this vision of sex. As is well known, he proposed that *sex must be constrained to make civilization possible*, even to the extent that the human race may die out as a consequence: ""Thus we may perhaps be forced to become reconciled to the idea that it is quite impossible to adjust the claims of the sexual instinct to the demands of civilization; that in consequence of its [that is, man's] cultural development, renunciation and suffering, as well as the danger of extinction in the remotest future, cannot be avoided by the human race."" Obviously, this is not one of the ideas Freud will be remembered for, one embarrassingly period bound. But **Freud is, of course, the modern authority for the image of sex as wild and primitive, at odds with decency**, the beast with two backs rattling the bars of its makeshift cage. Perhaps no less than St. Paul he thought of us as daily wrestling with our animal nature. It is well-argued here that human sexual nature (especially that of women) is the enemy of civilization. That without society imposing its authority and making us play nice, we'd all be fucking and killing (in order to fuck). &gt; Now here's a big surprise: **the reality that Freud observed was entirely the reverse. Freud's belief in the strength of the sex drive was based on his observations of its weakness.** The evidence that Freud adduces for his vision of universal sexual repression is his observation of a widespread lack of libido in both men and women that he called impotence, being careful to say that he was using the term in the broadest possible sense. The above citation was the conclusion he came to at the end of an essay in which he presents the following evidence: ""If the concept of psychical impotence is broadened and is not restricted to failure to perform the act of coitus...we may in the first place add all those men who are described as psychoanaesthetic: *men who never fail in the act but who carry it out without getting any particular pleasure from ita state of affairs that is more common than one would think....* An easily justifiable analogy takes one from these anaesthetic men to *the immense number of frigid women...* &gt; ""If however we turn our attention not to an extension of the concept of psychical impotence, but to the gradations in its symptomatology, we cannot escape the conclusion that *the behavior in love of men in the civilized world bears the stamp altogether of psychical impotence.""* &gt; This was the sexual reality that Freud observed *only to reject it.* It is as if he observed that all the boys were learning mathematics with girls in the room and, fully agreeing with Dean Amringe, concluded that there must be something wrong with all the boys, this could not be the natural state of man. Hence Freud's inference that this lack of sexual excitement must be the wound we bear in the service of civilized life. Dr. Apfelbaum goes on to critique Freud's proposed mechanisms for ""psychical impotence"" and how masturbation and ""coitus reservatus"" are inadequate forms of discharge. Since a lot of Freud's explanations are widely discredited anyway, there's not much need to bring it up here, so I'll leave you to read the original essay if you're interested. &gt; My contention is that **this was Freud's way of accounting for the difference between his sexual fantasies and his sexual reality** . . . this was a relatively simple case of Freud's knowing that he had all kinds of forbidden impulses during the day, but when opportunity presented itself he was not always ready. As do most men, **he concluded not that he had learned something about sexual reality, but that his ability to respond sexually had been impaired, and that this might even portend the eventual extinction of the human race ""in the remotest future.""** It seems Freud would have agreed with TRP's doomsayers. &gt; He was as far as ever from conceiving of the possibility that the ""complete"" sexual satisfaction that he envisioned could only be made *possible* by civilization. &gt; The nerve endings call out for satisfaction, ""complete"" satisfaction. ""Civilization"" represented an opposing force. The irony is that it is ""civilization"" that led Freud to the view that the sexual reality he saw was a simulacrum, a pale shadow of the passionate and unfettered sexuality immanent in our natures. It is our institutionalized other-worldliness that formed Freud's vision. **It is ""civilization"" that led Freud to his belief in the defectiveness of his and all his cohorts' sexuality.** &gt; All of this is to say that when people are asked what sex is for, they respond reflexively, wittingly or unwittingly making a distinction between *sex as they know it and sex as they **imagine** it should or could be.* This is the sex of corrupting demons, surging hormones, and heavenly choirs. Now you might argue that Freud's time period was indeed unusually sexually restrictive(if you bring up Victorian England, remember Freud was *Austrian*), and that his conclusions are therefore accurate. But Dr. Apfelbaum adds a little more perspective to the matter: &gt; If this much is clear, I would now like to reverse this way of thinking about sex in favor of discovering what sex is about by looking around us . . . &gt; What would sex look like to a Martian? My guess is that he would rather quickly conclude that **the purpose of sex is to possess another person.** To pick a seldom discussed but nevertheless highly revealing example, most cultures are and have been fascinated with bridal virginity. This should not be dismissed simply as a concern with property rights. A man feels quite differently if what is stolen from him is his wife as compared with his ox or his car, and he takes title with a good deal more gusto. Here is how one scholar put it: &gt; ""Bridal virginity has been a preoccupation of most societies throughout history, but although it is usually associated with questions of legality and legitimacy there is much to suggest that the specifically sexual aspect was also important, particularly in places such as Sparta, Crete, and Rome, where the wedding ceremony incorporated a kind of formalized representation of kidnapping for the purpose of rapewhich, psychologically, is a more extreme version of defloration. Indian Muslims, at some stages of history, are recorded as practicing public defloration as proof of the bride's premarital chastity, while both they and the tribal Kurd were accustomed to display a cloth stained with hymeneal blood for the same reason. In both cases the avowed object helps to mask a strong element of masculine boasting over the act itself. Muslims appear to have been particularly fascinated by defloration. In the Islamic paradise, the believer was promised 10,000 virgins who, deflowered each night, have their virginity miraculously restored on the following morning."" &gt; This is the sex act as a ritual of possession. ""Masculine boasting over the act itself"" suggests, of course, that **the sex act in this context has little to do with sensual pleasure, much less intimacy, but is a celebration of masculine status.** Most societies throughout history and most contemporary societies are, of course, authoritarian and **sex is therefore a celebration of status and role, much as is the rest of the pattern of human relationships.** &gt; This means that the man who cannot boast over the act itself is as much in trouble as is the woman who cannot produce hymeneal blood. Indeed, with men's higher status comes greater vulnerability to humiliation. Thus, my use of the term ""possession"" is intended to convey the way sex can be a masculine province, but I want to stress that the prerogatives and entitlements that thereby accrue are also duties. Just as are women, men are prisoners of the ritual. &gt; Now what of simple lust? My argument is that **lust best describes the sex of our fantasies** and that although that is the sex we know best, it only clouds our vision of sexual reality. All the people Freud observed who were sexually apathetic were not simply, or not necessarily repressing (or otherwise avoiding) their sexual potential, *they were reacting to (or against) the sexual reality that in fact existed.* Men of Sparta, Crete, and Rome, the Indian Muslims, and the Kurd, may have at times not looked forward to their ritual consummations. On the other hand, the believer who is to spend his time in paradise with 10,000 virgins may be counted on to look forward to it **since fantasy partners can be expected to be unerringly arousing, unlike his real partner**, someone chosen by his family as a good social and/or economic investment. &gt; There can be no question that **sex from within the old paradigm represented a requirement to demonstrate proficiency at one's role.** Examples are available as far back as recorded history takes us: Ancient Egyptian physicians signified on their papyri that a man was impotent by writing that he was *""incapable of doing his duty.* Essential to the role is the capacity to possess the partner. *Whether or not the act is enjoyed is not a relevant question* from within this paradigm. &gt; There is an almost universally shared impression among sexologists that men did experience a kind of unfettered sexuality in Ancient (Taoist) China. However, a closer look indicates that this was only the freedom to perform: &gt; ""Just as the European of early medieval times knew, without quite understanding why, that sex was sinful but occasionally permissible, so his contemporary in China knew, without quite understanding why, that sex was a *sacred duty* and one that he must perform frequently and conscientiously if he was truly to achieve harmony with the Supreme Path, the Way, Tao."" &gt; Ask any Sultan whether a harem was as much a garden of erotic delights as Reubens would have it, considering the schedule of sexual encounters that he was expected to adhere to undeviatingly, with time off only for illness: &gt; ""It might reasonably be expected that where polygamy flourished there would be no need for prostitution. But this was very far from the case. The conscientious Chinese husband, in fact, frequently went to prostitutes not for sexual intercourse but to escape from it."" I've heard on TRP before about ""blue-pill"" men who seek out prostitutes just for company and talk instead of sex. Who knew they might've had harems? &gt; And then, of course, there is Polynesia. Among sexologists, this is the other lodestone for the biological-romantic mystique. As Haeberle, the well-known historian of sex, put it: &gt; ""Various explorers returned home with news of sexually uninhibited ""noble savages"" in distant parts of the globe. The French Captain Bougainville and the English Captain Cook found sensuous, happy people in Tahiti and on other Pacific islands, and this discovery cast serious doubt on the sexual standards of Europe."" &gt; In Mangaia, for example, there even is a word for the sound of moist genitalia bumping together. Haeberle reports that Cook was especially impressed to find that the Tahitians ""had sexual intercourse in public and 'gratified every appetite and passion *before witnesses*'."" However, this should have been a clue to the possibility that this was not the sexual freedom it appeared to be. An additional clue in Cook's own account was his observation that ""Among the spectators were several women of superior rank who...gave instructions to the girl [who participated in a demonstration witnessed by Cook] how to perform her part. &gt; Our suspicions are confirmed by Marshall's more systematic ethnographic account of Polynesian sexuality: &gt; ""The Mangaian, or Polynesian girl takes **an immediate demonstration of sexual virility and masculinity as the first test of her partner's desire for her and as the reflection of her own desirability...** One virility test used by Mangaian women is to require a lover to have sexual intercourse without making contact with any part of the partner's body other than the genitalia."" &gt; Polynesian men have no complaints about the women's sexual demands; they are fully prepared to meet them: &gt; The Mangaian emphasis is not on upon the number of times a night that a man can achieve climax; rather, he sets his sights on the number of nights a week that he is capable of coitus. In his teens and twenties, he aims at every night capability... He also judges potency by his ability (or that of others) to get the same woman pregnant twice in one year... Mangaian men are aware that in central Polynesia it is said that the name of an island ""travels on a man's penis."" Mangaian men do not wish to let the name of their island ""fall. &gt; Marshall reports that ""**invariably, tira [impotence] is said by informants to be 'common'.**"" He speculates that a cause may be ""the stress upon nightly copulation."" He also adds that ""the shame factor in impotence is very great"" (caused by the demands of ""civilization?""), and so we can expect that Captain Cook was offered no chance to witness a public exhibition of this feature of Polynesian sexuality. Here's more insight into ancient views of [impotence](URL and [gender relations](URL The former is not from Dr. Apfelbaum, but from Angus McLaren's book ""Impotence: A Cultural History."" &gt; Most societies are authoritarian and in them we are not likely to find areas of freedom, *sexual or otherwise.* Along with bridal virginity, the arranged marriage is the institution that best conveys the temper of the typical human society. And now for a little modern critique: &gt; In our progress toward developing individual egos we have reduced the [fear of the stranger] in a new way; we now have been able to internally locate and make sense of much of our experience. We can even risk a little promiscuity. **But fewer arranged relationships has thus far meant fewer relationships of any kind since our fear of the stranger is by no means eliminated and we now lack adequately reassuring meeting-and-greeting rituals.** This has even resulted in preventing some people from having any partners, an astonishing development, at least from a tribal perspective. We now find ourselves groping for the lost rituals. We now write to advice columnists asking how to make or break a date, how to refuse an invitation, or how to get our guests to leave . . . &gt; Essential to the new role definition is the capacity to make contact with the partner. We now hear that *sex is communication* (a rather foreign notion to the Indian Muslim, the Taoist Chinese, the Polynesian, the Victorian, or for most other peoples, past or present.) This is why when asked what sex is for, most people will now say that it is an expression of love and the ultimate form of intimacy. This is taken *ritualistically*, as I have been arguing, with the result that *we now feel obliged to respond to our partners and to make our partners respond to us.* One way to put this is to say that **sex as a ritual of possession is in the process of being replaced by sex as a ritual of mutual affirmation.** &gt; The new purpose for sex has been structured in the old way, integrated in accordance with our duty-bound habits of thought. In the past we felt ashamed of *not* being able to perform in sex. We still do. Only now we *also* feel ashamed of wanting to perform. Sex: enjoy it, be good at it, make your partner cum. Or else. &gt; THE JOB OF SEX Sex therapists are repeatedly struck by the way most people feel *compelled to perform* in sex, having to respond on cue. In fact, the conception of sex as a performance is built into the language. We say that a man is or is not *able* to get an erection. If he is not able to he is impotent, which is to say powerless. If he is not able to maintain his erection, we say that he *lost* it, not that it *got lost* or that it *went away.* Every man knows he's not responsible for his erections. So why do we feel ashamed when they show up at the wrong times, or not at all? (For real though, if you're having trouble with ED or arousal, [this essay](URL of his might change your life.) &gt; But, as I discussed earlier, when people are asked what sex is for, they don't say anything about it being a test of adequacy or a performance. They say that sex is for procreation, release, or the expression of love and closeness. Yet these are the same people who, when they are not being asked what sex is for, will unapologetically speak of *sexual prowess.* &gt; Yet there is no necessary inconsistency here. **When people say that sex means release and closeness it is true that they do not think of themselves as describing sex as a test of adequacy, but what they are in fact doing is giving the criteria on which the test is to be graded.** What sex therapists observe is that in sex, people are trying to be adequate at the new role definitions. They are trying to be *adequate* in the pursuit of pleasure and intimacy. &gt; Sex partners work at being mutually reassuring. Sex talk is all encouragement and flattery (I have at times likened it to infield chatter). Sex means always saying yes. It is all hyperbole; no one believes or expects their partner to believe anything said in sex. Perhaps the most telling clue to sex-as-performance is the fact that in sex we all try to keep everything as smooth as possible. What does keeping things smooth and always saying yes have to do with release, pleasure, love, or closeness? **What we all are doing is trying to act as abandoned and intimate as possible. *This is the test.*** And this is why when asked what sex is for no one mentions the pressure to be responsive; they just say that sex means being responsive. &gt; . . . This responsiveness is thought of as biological, as a reaction pattern waiting to be triggered. No matter how hard people work at sex, they still believe that the reaction pattern they are after is spontaneous. They see themselves as working only to trigger it. Dr. Apfelbaum goes on to emphasize how sex therapists do nothing to allay people's performance fears because they completely ignore the reality of how people view and approach sex. &gt; Regarding the purpose of sex they [the Zussmans] declare: ""If you want to get really close to another person, sharing your sexuality is the most intense [they mean the best] form of communication available."" &gt; And regarding the nature of sex: &gt; ""There are no standards to meet, no goals that must be reached, no rules except a responsibility to not hurt others or to allow yourself to be hurt."" &gt; Now, I hardly need tell you that this was not a summary of what the Zussmans found to be the nature and purpose of sex from their work with the 800 couples. I would be surprised if even one of these couples experienced sex in the way the Zussmans describe it, as without goals or rules and as an unparalleled form of communication . . . &gt; Think of it this way: How many couples would the Zussmans have to work with before they began to revise their conception of the nature and purpose of sex? Sixteen hundred? Thirty-two hundred? Thirty-two thousand? &gt; I think the answer is that even if they worked with everybody, this would have no effect on their conception of sex. If they worked with everybody and found that everybody felt this pressure to prove their adequacy in sex, the Zussmans would feel bad about that but it would not affect their conception of sex. They would just think that they were witnessing an epidemic of sexual afflictions. &gt; There is the irony here that if it is true that people forget that sex is a test of adequacy, therapists (of all kinds) forget that they, perhaps more than anyone else, *take the ability to fulfill sex role-demands as an ultimate test of adequacy (maturity).* Although this practice by no means began with Freud, he gave it much of its present currency among therapists. *He quite literally adopted prevalent sex-role definitions as his measures of maturity.* We here at TRP are no different. The ability to have many long-lasting and mutually satisfying sexual relationships is ultimately what this sub is about. That is *our* test of adequacy. &gt; The rule of no-rules is just the idea that sex should be spontaneous, that people should let it happen and stop interfering with it. Just as people think that no matter how hard they are working at sex they are simply trying to trigger a spontaneous reaction pattern, so even sex therapists will offer rules that are not rules because they are designed only to liberate our spontaneous sexual selves. Porn and erotica only bring us further away from understanding and approaching sex realistically: &gt; The people in professional sex films rarely have sex problems and those they do have are easily solved. They always know what they want and they always ask for it with a smile. They are understanding and patient and never want more than their fair share . . . *This is not presented as an ideal; it is presented as the way sex is*, or would be if only people would allow it. Now you may argue that teaching everyone to be competent in sex - or at least not to treat it like a test - would solve all our problems. In other words, if we all had the competence and attitudes of pornstars, everyone would be having as much sex as possible. But even pornstars don't do that, so you know it's not that simple: &gt; There is no evidence of any thought being given to why sex may be considered dirty. The idea is that our guilt about sex and our sexual inhibitions are a historical accident, a vestige of our Puritan and Victorian heritage that has no basis in reality. &gt; The thinking here is slipshod to the point of capriciousness. **Sex guilt and sexual inhibitions are world-wide.** The sexual restrictions found in China, India, and Russia can hardly be traced to the Puritans and the Victorians. Even the Church Fathers did not originate sex guilt. Indeed, Augustine, in his City of God (Book XIV, Chapter 18), argued that *he saw evidence of sexual shame all around him* (he at least did not dismiss sexual reality, even if he took it too much at face value), and that it was this rather than some purely supernal vision that led him to conclude that *sex is inherently shameful.* Consider this: you'd feel ashamed of fucking someone you weren't attracted to, right? Here's the kicker: *you don't find most women attractive* (if you do, subtract makeup/push-up bras/yoga pants/photoshop from the equation). In fact, most people don't find most other people attractive. So if everyone had sex with everyone else, shame would be the rule rather than the exception. &gt; No one has yet offered a way to reasonably comprehend the idea that sex is dirty. It seems to me that the best way to comprehend it is to think of it as a reaction to the exploitive side of sex, a not inconsiderable side of sexual reality. In this light *the counter-dogma that sex is OK (not dirty) represents a laundering of sexual reality.* The feminists, in their quest against ""rape culture"" and masculinity/femininity, are especially guilty of this distortion of the true nature of sex. The vision of sex they impose (i.e. affirmative consent) is disturbingly far removed from reality. Indeed, the entire feminist movement can be seen as a revolt against the performance standards and reality of sex acts. We here at TRP at least admit and try to understand the darker side of sex. Dr. Apfelbaum goes on to dispel the notion that sex is the ultimate form of communication and connection (he has another great essay on how [sex is typically non-intimate anyway](URL &gt; . . .In the best representation of sexual reality available in the professional literature, Masters and Johnson, reporting on their observations of volunteer couples in the laboratory, found that *discomfort was ritualistically concealed.* Their sample was composed of 307 committed heterosexual couples, chosen for their *freedom from sexual difficulties.* The women were often made uncomfortable by the rather abrupt and vigorous way their partners fondled their breasts, especially during their menstrual periods. Although the women admitted their discomfort to Masters and Johnson, *on only three occasions (out of thousands of observations) did a woman ask her husband to be more gentle and* **no woman ever asked her husband to stop.** The same problem arose over early and deep digital penetration of the vagina by their husbands, as well as overly vigorous clitoral manipulation. &gt; The husbands were, if anything, even *less* likely than their wives to communicate dissatisfaction. The most frequent complaint made to Masters and Johnson by the husbands was that their wives did not grasp the shaft of the penis tightly enough. **Not one of the men had ever mentioned this to his wife** either during the period of observation or at any other time. Can you *imagine* a guy complaining about the sex he had? How ungrateful! &gt; Although the husbands were conspicuously unable accurately to perceive their wives' states of mind, what was most revealing was the husbands' belief that their perceptions were accurate despite the obvious ambiguity they were faced with. They asked no questions. Yet they were consistently oblivious to their wives' discomfort even though the women's pained grimaces were plainly visible to the observers. The men assumed their wives were enjoying it and *few of the women punctured this illusion.* You're don't trust what women say, so why would you trust what they scream? &gt; The men just wanted to know how to make the women satisfyingly responsive. This is the sex-as-duty paradigm. The idea is that the women owe them the response they need. It is not a matter of simple suzerainty since *the men [also] feel bound to meet the women's needs,* as I have already noted. Perhaps what has happened is that the new mutuality is still understood from within the old paradigm, meaning that sex is now organized as a ritual of mutual possession . . . [so] *what we now find in sex is people who either play out a ritual of mutual possession or who are refugees from it.* **Summary: Sex is the oldest and most universal of tests. Our ever-changing view of what sex means (performance, masculinity/femininity, intimacy, pleasure) is just the criteria upon which the test is graded. Lack of sexual freedom, impotence, and sexual inhibition is endemic to many cultures, both modern and ancient. It may even be instinctive. Furthermore, our wild, liberated sexual fantasies (and representations in media) are poor representations of sexual reality, yet we still judge our sexual adequacy and self-worth based on fulfilling them. Sex has historically been a ritualized, non-intimate activity, and most people are oblivious of their partners' experience and dishonest about their own anyway.**"

Body: Little kids pick on each other to develop a social heirarchy. Adults are the same way. Even your closest friends will do subtle things to establish social dominance over you. It might be a little jab here or there, or it might be something completely humiliating. It might be only body language, for example body blocking you subtley when youre both talking to some women. For the most part, your friends and relatives who are doing this don't even REALIZE they are doing it, just like women who are shit testing you dont REALIZE they are shit testing you. Its a subconcious thing that is happening due to millions of years of evolution, designed to put you in your proper social ranking. Women shit test you, and so do other men. When you fail mens shit tests, your social standing is lower and they establish a form of dominance over you. Standard Ways Other Men Shit Test You: A. Throwing out jabs, to expose subtle weaknesses of yours Examples of something a friend might say to lower you social ranking: Friend says (in a social situation, prob with girls around): Bob still lives with his mom and he seems happy - (implies lack of independence) Friend says (in a social situation, prob with girls around): Are you really bald or do you just shave your head? - (its a poke to expose any sort of weakness you may have towards thinning hair and lower your confidence if you do have such a vulnerability) Friend says (in a social situation, prob with girls around): Phil spends an hour in the bathroom, hes like a woman. - (A subtle attempt at lowering your masculinity and making you appear more feminine) Friend says (in a social situation, prob with girls around): Tim's a gamer - (Basically painting you as a socially inept loser who spends his time alone in fantasy worlds) B. Direct Insults which they don't expect you to fight back on since they are your friend. Friend says (in a social situation, prob with girls around): This guys out to lunch! Friend says (in a social situation, prob with girls around): Were you born yesterday! Friend says (in a social situation, prob with girls around): Youre not too smart are you!? C. Verbal and Physical Dominance Through Alpha Upping Friend body blocks you in social conversation Friend dominates the conversation and doesnt let you speak Friend uses a combination of jabs, direct insults, body blocks, and maintains center of attention Many of you may think: If your friend does this, hes not your friend. Thats NOT true. He is not doing this on purpose, it is built within humans and hes doing this naturally. Just like when a hot woman shit tests you, shes not a bad person, shes simply eliminating physically and mentally weak men by exposing your weaknesses. Men do this to other men as well Lessons Learned: On red pill we love talking about how to defeat women's shit tests, but we never talk about defeating other mens shit tests so that WE are the dominant male in a social setting. How do we PREVENT being alpha upped by other men in social settings, sometimes our best friends or even relatives? Please share in the comments section your thoughts on how to defeat male shit tests. My own personal experience is to never be defensive. Never try to defend an insult, or act hostily to other males attempting to alpha upping you. By acting defensively, you are validating them. Instead, you retaliate with your own firepower. The best defense is a good offense. Dont even acknowledge what they said or did, but hit them back with something harder. The key is to make it subtle, you cannot ever appear to be affected by the insult, body block, jab, or whatever they are doing to establish dominance. You can only return fire with something stronger and you have to make it seem unintentional. I dont give a fuck, agree and amplify, agree and diregard, pressure flipping, as a poster mentioned in the comments below. Share your comebacks for the examples listed above, jabs, body blocks, dominance establishments, alpha upping, and give your own insight on how to establish dominance in a subtle way."
121,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Setting up a date the right way.,134,3vdm4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3vdm4f/setting_up_a_date_the_right_way/,2015-12-04 15:51:16,"I've been a lurker on TRP for quite some time now. I've learned a lot from this place and I figured it's time to start contributing to the main page. In the last few months, I've begun contributing to AskTRP more often and can't help but notice how the majority of guys are going the wrong way about one of the most important aspects of the dating process: MEETING UP WITH THE ACTUAL FEMALE. But before I get all of this started, I want to make this very clear. **Always be polarizing**. What does it mean to 'polarize'? When you polarize, you're sticking your neck out to get either a ""yes"" or a ""no"". Basically, you have to make yourself *vulnerable* to rejection. Mark Manson does a great job of explaining this in Models. This will save you time and help you get where you want to go faster. This is a numbers game and we want to get through the ""no's"" so we can NEXT and find the ""yes's"". Polarization and vulnerability shows that you are a man who knows what he wants and is not afraid to do what it takes to get it. ----**So, you got her number. Now what do you do?**---- There's two ways you can go about this, with the preferred method being the latter: 1. Text her your name immediately. Most of the time, I'll get something along the lines of a "";)"" or a ""Thanks!"" back (both being IOIs), unless I'm standing right there. Sometimes I don't get a response, which is okay. 2. Wait until the end of the night and send: ""Hey *name*, it was nice meeting you tonight."" That's it. This is basically to see if you get any response (IOI). Normally, I'll get a response along the lines of: ""It was nice meeting you too!"". If she uses your name in the sentence and didn't have your number saved, that's a major IOI. She was anticipating your text. After you do this, whatever response you get from her, **do not respond**. The next time you talk to her is going to be you setting a day and time to meet up. **QUICK NOTE** I see way too many guys trying to build rapport through texting. **STOP**. That's what meeting up in person is for. You cannot do this through texting. It's too impersonal. I've seen people say it in here before: **Texting is for logistics only**. It really is that simple. The whole point in you getting her phone number is so that you can reach out to her about setting up a day and time to meet up again. And I'll explain how to do that correctly. ----**Initiating**---- Once I get a number, I'll normally wait until the second day to initiate. Some guys like to wait a day or two longer, but the point is to not display neediness in contacting her the very next day. And if you made a big enough of an impression, it can help build sexual tension in her waiting for you to contact her. You can start off with any simple opener, such as a ""Hey, what's going on?"" or ""Hey, what's up?"". After that, **do not text her anything else.** Wait. The point of the initial text is to just get back a response, which will let you know if she is receptive to you. If you don't get a response back, NEXT. That was easy. Normally, you'll get back something along the lines of: ""Hey, I'm doing this and this. What about you?"" or ""Hey, what's up?"" This is where most guys want to start with small talk texting. But you already know not to do that. Here, we're going to be straight forward. Just state your intentions. **Polarize**. But, first... **QUICK NOTE** When you're setting up a date, you want to set it up in the best way possible for sex to happen. You're not friends with this chick, or trying to be. You are sexually interested in her. Don't ask her out on a lunch date or any type of date during the day that has no potential to escalate. **Remember: In order for sex to happen, it must be the man's fault.** So, it's your job to lead the way and make it happen. Do yourself a favor and set this up the right way. ----**Setting the Date**---- Once she responds, you're just going to be honest. Maybe something like: ""That's cool. I was actually going to see if you'd want to go grab a drink sometime this week. Do you have any nights open?"" **Notice how I asked her if she had any nights open!** I've seen so many guys go on AskTRP complaining: *""I told her she should come out with me Friday and she said she already made plans!* or *""She said she was busy that night!""* You don't say! She was busy?! No way! Newsflash guys: **Women do have lives and have other shit going on. She could very well be telling the truth.** Some guys would simply say that she could just suggest another night. And some women, if they're interested enough, will do that. But why would you expect her to do that or rely on that? Women don't like to be the ones in control of the plans. You're the one that's supposed to be leading the interaction. If she doesn't suggest another night, then what do you do? Ask her about another night? Wait a few days and ask again? This comes off as you chasing her, which is needy. When you ask her right off the bat if she has any nights open, you're simplifying this process for yourself and making it easier to polarize. No response? NEXT. ""I actually don't think I have any open nights this week :/"" NEXT. ""I'm busy all week this week. Maybe next week?"" It's possible that she's telling the truth. It's also possible that she just doesn't want to tell you 'no'. It's up to you to decide whether you want to set something up the next week to see for sure. She could cancel last minute. Who knows? Normally, I NEXT. ""Yea! I'm open Thursday night :)"" Well, what do you know?! She gave you a night! Now what? This is an obvious sign that she is interested in going out with you. If she gives you multiple nights, she's really interested. And of course, if that night doesn't work for you, you can always ask if she's open another night. Now, there's two different ways to go about this: you can either suggest a time to pick her up, or suggest a time to meet at a certain venue. Personally, I like to suggest a time to pick her up. This gives you more control of the situation and gives you less of a chance of getting stood up. Plus, I'm not going to ask out a girl that I wouldn't want to go pick up. If you choose this route, say something like: ""Ok pick you up at 8?"". If she agrees, ask her where she lives. I've almost always gotten an address after asking. Once she sends that to you, just tell her you'll see her then. **Do not text her after that.** If she suggests that you two just meet somewhere, I consider that a shit test. Handle accordingly. If you ask her to meet you somewhere, it's just as simple as that. Suggest a time and place. Once she agrees, tell her you'll see her then. **Do not text her after that.** Hopefully, she shows up and shows up alone. I once knew a girl who couldn't go on a first date by herself. She would always find a way to bring a friend. If she tries to text you anytime before the date, don't send more than just a few texts. Tell her you have to run and you'll see her whatever night you scheduled. The point of not talking before the date is to build sexual tension. Trust me, she's going to be thinking about it and wondering about it. This is a good thing. ----**Conclusion**---- You've successfully set up the date in a very controlled fashion. You've polarized in such a way that you have wasted a minimal amount of time and effort. You have also built up sexual tension by not talking before the date. You haven't expressed any neediness. The last thing to do is to give her a call once you show up (or just go knock on her door) and take it from there. If you guys like this, I will do other submissions in the future on approaching and what to actually do on dates. With this being my first post, I'm open to any and all suggestions. Thanks. Edit: I forgot to mention, a woman will often contact you the day of to find out exactly what you'll be doing. Normally, this is just her trying to find out what she needs to wear that night. In fact, assume that's what she's doing. Make a joke about it and help her out. Last time I took a girl out, she did this and I said ""Ha You're trying to find out what to wear aren't you?"" She told me that was exactly what she was doing and I just told her to wear some jeans and something simple, like she was going out. Worked out great."
122,vulnerability,TheRedPill,"I got laid last night, even though I didn't kiss her till she was in my bed [FR]",0,3y35kx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3y35kx/i_got_laid_last_night_even_though_i_didnt_kiss/,2015-12-25 02:07:54,"**TLDR: Met with HB8 off tinder, and despite fucking up a couple times with shaky frame, I somehow still got her in bed...didn't even kiss her till she was IN my bed** So, I matched with this HB8 three days ago, we exchanged like two messages, and my shitty online game was getting me nowhere...in fact she called me out on it saying *is this how you flirt with all the girls you meet* Shit test, right? My response was one taken from the book *Models by Marc Manson* in that I immediately just gave some vulnerability and said something along the lines of *Well, I'm actually a fun/goofy guy in person, I just suck at online interactions* And surprisingly, the next message was her number.' Seeing that Manson's advice worked for me, I tried some of that again, simply being genuinely interested in this woman over text, and after a ~20 or so text exchange, SHE asked me about getting drinks, I told her yesterday, and I also told her the spot, she complied. Afterwards, I followed TRP protocol which is just radio silence, and she texted me the day of to confirm. In person, opened with a one-armed hug, got drinks and dinner (went Dutch on the bill). Early on in the date, there was a guy with a great Christmas outfit, and she commented on it a couple times, (the guy himself was also pretty jacked). When I saw other people taking photos with him, I jumped up and got a photo with him too, chatted him for two minutes, and soon enough, she jumped up and wanted a photo with him too. After I got my pic, I went and sat down, I noticed that he was chatting her a bit, and insisted she come see his band, as well as take his number. I wasn't even mad, in my mind, I was impressed at this guy for gaming a chick while on a date himself, and while she was on a date with me. **How would some of you guys have reacted if you were in my shoes?** Afterwards, the guy came over, talked to me for a bit, I got his number, and when he left, I thanked my date and said ""thanks, if it weren't for you, no way I woulda got that jacked guy's number"" We talked about random topics - ones that I thought were notable included: masturbation habits (and my preference NOT to masturbate), our dating histories, she mentioned how she had an ex that cheated, I mentioned the same about mine. There was a bit of kino here and there, I told a funny story or two that really had her laughing. We then left and walked to a karaoke bar, sang a couple songs, and talked a bit more. And from there we got tacos, and on the way to the taco spot, she simply says ""I'd invite you to my place, but I'm not done unpacking."" I simply reply with ""You're welcome to come to my place, but I wanna get tacos first"" Another fuckup - she was the one who initiated convo about going home - keep in mind, still haven't even kissed her yet. We get to my place, eat tacos, and talk for a few minutes, at which point I jokingly say ""Sooo are we gonna go to my bed or do ya wanna awkwardly stand around talking all night"" STILL haven't kissed her. It wasn't till we were both settled, in my bed, that we finally kissed, subsequently f-closed, and talked/played some more before sleeping. This morning, I had to leave early for work, and so, I had a quickie (she was expecting more, but I simply chuckled and said too bad). I took my shower, got dressed, saw that I had ten minutes to spare, so I gave her a back massage, got up, and for some damn (see: beta) reason, I was lingering, and went and turned her around to kiss her goodbye before I left. Some reflections about the night: Early on, I embraced the Marc Manson motto of ""show your vulnerability"" But one thing I felt I struggled with was trying to be vague about info and make her ""work"" to get me to reveal details about myself. Every once in a while, I'd catch myself saying too much, and so, I'd reel it back in, but I had a few slip-ups like that. Also, during the night, I'd say dumb things like talk excessively about my career, but I'd notice that I'd been talking for more than70 consecutive seconds, so I would quickly transition to a topic about her. Even at one point later in the night, I let a ""sexist"" notion slip that women are usually the ones who know all song lyrics (I don't even necessarily believe this, but I usually will make a joking off-hand sexist remark to get a reaction out of girls - in this case it was a mental fumble because it didn't even make sense). But one skill I've started to work on was that of redirecting and fogging. I'm already certain that I've fucked up at some points, one of them being that I didn't escalate very much early on - I probably should've kissed her in between going from the bar to the karaoke spot - but I didn't even have a clue as to what I should've done to go in for the kiss. Suggestions on that specifically are much welcomed. I'm also eagerly awaiting for the criticism/feedback about my poor form throughout the night. But I'm especially curious to hear what those of you who have read *Models* have to say. Because I used some of his strategies (vulnerability &amp; don't play games) and it seemed to work. He is a huge advocate of establishing an ""emotional connection"" and that this is the way into bedding ladies. Another question I'm grappling with is, did she place me on the beta ladder, or did I move myself to the beta ladder vis a vis my actions? Aand I'm assuming standard approach of radio silence till she texts me? And as an aside - maybe twice during the night she said something that I really liked (a quality about her &amp; a sexual preference) and I had a hard time containing my giddy (beta) excitement and said ""wow I think I really like you"" **Conclusion: I caught myself slipping up and having a shaky frame at certain points, but I think due to a combination of A) pre-selection bias (she agreed to go out with me, she's interested) B) always assume attraction, kinda goes with A, but I feel it merits reiteration that women decide if they wanna sleep with you early on (*Models* strategy) C) taking the opportunity to ""game"" her when I saw the opening (very few openings detected by me, due to my inexperience)**"
123,vulnerability,TheRedPill,How I Got my LTR on Board with Polyamory,0,3qpvcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3qpvcp/how_i_got_my_ltr_on_board_with_polyamory/,2015-10-30 03:02:54,"Gentleman, I haven't frequented this sub for many months. For a while, I found it got washed out with a bunch of nonsense. However, I've been in amazing LTR with my girlfriend since June 2014, and a lot of it is due to TRP shedding light on a few matters. Recently, she has come around to having an open relationship, wherein we have the **freedom** to live out our lives however we see fit. This includes not having to live together, seeing other people (which can include sex), and calling things off whenever we feel like it might become appropriate. This all revolves around freedom to be happy. If something in the relationship isn't working 100%, we adapt. Let me start off stating that if you are not happy with your life as a single man or woman, you have no right to search for a relationship (perhaps not even a one night stand). Your life doesn't have to be 100% perfect at the moment, but you need to have a sense of confidence in what you're doing with your life and who you are. If you aren't content with yourself, you have work to do. As I see if, a relationship is only as strong as it's weakest link. If you serious issues in your life that prevent you from being relatively happy, you need to figure that out first. A relationship only works if both parties are 100% okay with being alone (single) at any moment. I love my girlfriend, but if our relationship ended at any point throughout the last year and half, I would have been totally fine because I know that only I can make myself happy. No one will ever fill the holes in your life. No one. The best way for me to convey the evolution of my view on relationships and the progress of my current relationship is to just tell the story. In late 2012, I broke up with my first serious lover. She was hot, I was young, and I broke all TRP guidelines. I came in to the situation with a strong frame etc, but after falling totally in love with a sexy girl that had sex with me, I soon started to become a rag doll. My relationship ended as I was in my first semester of college. I went to the local community college while my friends were all at universities in other cities. Basically ""stranded"" in my home town with no friends and without my lover (who caused so much torment in my life for the last 6 months of our 12 month stint), I went full monk mode. I was gifted being handsome of face, I was very fit, but having psoriasis always left me feeling self-conscious. (As a side note, if you have psoriasis, don't let it hold you back. I started working out to compensate for it, and it honestly works. Ignore the fact you have it. Treat it the best you can, and make no apologies. Girls really don't care.) For almost the next 2 years, I was pretty much in solitude. I studied hard in school, read a lot of books on American Transcendentalism (Thoreau/Emerson), reinvested in hobbies, and finally came to peace with myself. At the latter end of this time of introspection, I fucked up my ankle climbing a few mountains. At this time, I was off at a university an hour away from my home town (actually lived with 3 beautiful women, but still had no interest in seeing anyone). I left that school to come back home to get surgery. Post op, a friend who I just started hanging out with in a long time introduced me to TRP. It was the final nail in my semi-self-actualization and boosted me on my way to the first lay I had in a full year. I actually slept with two women while in a leg cast and on crutches - personality is king. So that was a long back story, but I think it's important. Summertime of 2014, I met a girl who I hated/hooked up with in high school at a concert. (By the way, I strongly encourage you to go to as much live music as possible.) Coincidentally, earlier that day she added my on Facebook. Green flags. A few days later I casually asked her to go to the local park and chill by the lake. My intentions were to catch up, see if she was dtf, and continue looking for other hook ups afterwards. She was much cooler than in highschool, very attractive, and overall surprised me. We saw each other probably every day afterwards and hooked up many times each week. I had no intention to make her my exclusive gf, but we were seeing each other every day. 3 months down the line, I solidified our partnership. At this point, I expressed to her many times already that I didn't see the point in marriage. There's no reason to have a love contract with someone, and in 10 years both people change, there shouldn't have to be a big ordeal about the split. Go your separate ways and be happy. In that vein of logic, I didn't see the point in making a relationship permanent/exclusive either. But, since we were together all the time, I was okay with being exclusive. Maybe 3 months later, I expressed to her that I love her totally, but I like to flirt with girls at school (going to a new university now - commuting from home). At times, I'd like to have sex with them. She wasn't thrilled with my saying this, but she wasn't a bitch about it either. We talked, expressed how we felt, and agreed that wasn't appropriate for XY and Z reasons. I don't really recall the conclusions, but I was cool with her not being okay with me wanting to sleep with other women on the side. I think I was telling her that I wanted to have the freedom to do things because we are two independent people coming together, etc etc etc.. She wasn't cool with it, and I valued our relationship more than new pussy, so I refrained. Some other point along the timeline, she decided it made sense that marriage is a weird social construct. She also sided with me that it's cool to not have kids and that she doesn't want any. Earth is overpopulated, kids cost mad money, you lose freedom, etc, whatever. Cool. At various other points in our time together, I've brought up controversial topics. I actually told her I wanted to end the relationship two different times because I felt I was tied down. Not specifically by her, but by the general responsibilities relationships carry inherently. Whenever I have had uncomfortable thoughts about our relationship, I bring them up and throw everything on the table. Communication, it works. Now with casual single event hook ups, personal disclosure probably isn't the best bet. But any significant TLR demands full vulnerability and clear communication. If you aren't happy with the ways things are going, state why and problem solve. Again, you are vulnerable in the aspect that the relationship might end if you present certain issues. But remember, that's okay. You're self reliant and comfortable being alone if that's the outcome. You cannot be responsible for someone else's happiness, and vice versa. I think most guys who want to sleep with other women are scared to bring that up with their partner. It's a risk that may result in the girl leaving you. So scary if you support your self worth on the pillars of someone else's interest in you. So recently, my girlfriend has been extremely into yoga. It's changed her life in significant, and also trivial ways. But this last month she's decided that it makes sense that humans have the right to make connections with multiple people. She loves her mom as much as her dad, she loves her close friends, she loves her dogs. Why is it so outlandish for her to love someone romantically besides me. Even if she doesn't love another partner, why can't she make the deep lustful connection with another man? I don't own her, she's not my property. I sure as hell don't want to be owned or controlled either. Humans have the right to talk, go on dates, or have sex with who ever we want. I listen to Chris Ryan's podcast a lot, also reading his famous work, Sex at Dawn which questions monogamy as the default narrative for human sexuality. Red Pill theory is correct in modern culture, especially in USA. But that doesn't mean that monogamy and all the disheartening truths of red pill tales are representative of basic human nature. They are likely based on deep social conditioning. Check the book out if you want to know more about how many sectors of humanity are based on polyamory. Overall, what I'm trying to tell you is that my relationship has been highly successful based on the sole fact that we are able to clearly communicate our aspirations and fears. When things don't work or we want to try new things, we talk about it. She has as much power in decision processes as I do. Even though she likes me to be dominant in many things, it doesn't mean she has no say. There's definitely plenty of cooperation, negotiation, and compromising. From what started as pretty standard monogamous relationship has now evolved to an open dynamic. No controlling of each other, just freedom to make choices and pursue ideals. And if it turns out that my girlfriend ends up spending more time with another man and ends up wanting to go back to being monogamous, except with him, then that makes sense. She's happier, and I'm happier because I don't have this dysfunctional relationship eating away at both of us. This system will never work if 1) you are not a self reliant individual, and 2) you are unwilling to lose your partner. The only rule in this approach is protected sex is a must, for health purposes. I'm not going back to edit this now for any grammar issues. This 1 1.5"" x 4"" text box is far too small to do any serious editing for a post this long. Hope this was insightful. I'll probably get bitched at to put this jargon in some relationship advice subreddit, but whatever. I'm just telling you fellas that are in LTRs that you can have best of both worlds so to say. You don't need to sacrifice your frame, dignity, or freedom as a man (or women, ladies) to get what you want out of a relationship. Every time I have a deep conversation about iffy topics with my girlfriend, we walk away loving each other in a deeper way. It's always a good way to assess how the relationship is going and if it's still working. Make changes or scrap the whole party if necessary. Just be happy. "
124,vulnerability,TheRedPill,The Red Pill Antibiotic Nuke **2015 UPDATE**,219,3r1ck6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3r1ck6/the_red_pill_antibiotic_nuke_2015_update/,2015-11-01 12:57:49,"Since the red pill antibiotic nuke was originally written the project has evolved exponentially. So what's new? There's an entirely new essay layout and 25 different topics intricate to the red pill philosophy discussed. The essay contents are far too large to paste in their entirety here, so I will leave you with just the first section to give you an idea [**and you can read the rest here should you desire.**](URL &gt;**Feminism, Pity, Power &amp; Privilege:** &gt;Feminists crave privileges which consolidate the realm of male power with that of the female. Typically they are traditionalist in ways which benefit women (men pay for dates, pressure to perform is squarely on men) but progressive where traditionalism would limit their power (intolerance for female promiscuity, a reluctance to trust women with leadership.) &gt;This is achieved by glossing over the influence of feminine soft power in society (influence and charm), and comparing men and women solely in hard power (economic and political). In taking this highly one-sided approach to power, feminists play upon humanitys propensity to take pity on women, and where the myth of female powerlessness is bought into, more power is redistributed to them. &gt;Feminism is nothing more than a female supremacy movement posing as one of humanist egalitarianism. Feminism highlights female incompetence in areas where men excel, redefines them as injustices by blaming men for female ineptitude, and then legally mandates the promotion of women within said areas. As such, women consistently make social gains in areas where men have traditionally dominated. &gt;All the while women continue to quietly monopolise soft power. Because social influence (the female monopoly on pity as well as beauty) is difficult to quantify, its prominence is neither stated nor factored into measures of equality. And in case you think that ridiculous, feminists factor in things as benign as the economic value of housework, so not to do the same with female beauty or vulnerability is highly disingenuous if your goal is to economically quantify elements relevant to social equality. &gt;Where the reverse occurred, where men monopolised hard power, we experienced 50~ years of social engineering to correct for the fact. The ability to be respected in spite of glaring vulnerability is a staggering albeit scarcely spoken of social advantage women enjoy, yet it is the pivotal psychological fulcrum on which feminism owes its modern ideological dominance. &gt;Where the pendulum has swung too far in favour of women, a successful male counter movement has failed to materialise. Not solely because, but chiefly because pity is in short supply for men. A man seeking pity is despised for his weakness rather than helped because of it, and so the very psychological mechanism which gave birth to female economic and political power is nought but a dead-end for men.

125,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Analyzing Popular Music to understand The Red Pill and prove it's merit,1,3rpdlw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3rpdlw/analyzing_popular_music_to_understand_the_red/,2015-11-06 12:09:41,"Popular music is a good indication of what are on people's minds. I personally don't like today's pop music, but the lyrics definately show an underlying theme of what The Red Pill is all about. I'm going to point to a few songs and highlight a few verses to illustrate how far this rabbit hole really goes. The first song I am going to look at is ""Locked Away"" by R. City featuring Adam Levine. (URL Adam Levine should be a good highlight since he catches the attention of most women. You can probably all remember that 3 year old cry when she learned he was married, so yes even girls at such an early age can even identify they want to lock a man down. I read a thread about how you should never tell women bad news, and keep a constant positive upkeep. Well this song... ""If I got locked away And we lost it all today... Tell me honestly... Would you still love me the same? If I showed you my flaws If I couldn't be strong Tell me honestly Would you still love me the same?"" Here he is pointing out that will a woman walk away if he doesn't ""keep frame"" and exposes some vulnerability (which all humans have). Also asks if he goes broke will she be there still? Then there is this verse... ""Now tell me would you really ride for me? (would you really ride for me?) Baby, tell me would you die for me? (tell me would you die for me?) Would you spend your whole life with me? (what's up?) Would you be there to always hold me down? Tell me would you really cry for me? (would you really cry for me?) Baby, don't lie to me (baby, don't lie to me) If I didn't have anything... (what's up?) I wanna know would you stick around?"" Questioning if a woman is actually there for him. You can see the trend of asking for honesty, and no lies... this is only highlighting the fact that there is something wrong with a woman having loyalty and commitment if things don't go so well. This song seems to address a notion of women being downright flakes. Like cats, they are gone at the first sense of danger or difficulty. The next song I am going to look at is ""What Do You Mean?"" from none other than Justin Beiber. (URL Now here is a guy who has ALL the girls just drooling over him, so he commands lots of attention from women. His ""bad-boy"" streak only helped him when he was getting arrested and partying. Justin must have access to what anyone could perceive as the highest quality of women from around the world, so lets see what he is telling us in his lyrics. Right from the get go... ""What do you mean? Ohh ohh ohh When you nod your head yes But you wanna say no What do you mean? Hey yeah When you don't want me to move But you tell me to go What do you mean?"" The dualistic nature of women, never communicating what they mean. ""First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right Wanna argue all day, make love all night First you up then you're down and then between Ohh I really want to know..."" Women constantly flip flopping on their decisions, never holding a steady pattern. ""You're overprotective when I'm leaving Trying to compromise but I can't win You wanna make a point but you keep preaching"" Even he understands that arguing isn't worth it with a woman. They just want to tell you ""how it is"". The overprotective line hints at the concept of dread, where a woman is definately more attracted if she has to get jealous and compete for a man. I think this is a shitty song, but after paying attention to The Red Pill, you can see that the frustration can hit the most ""successful"" men. He's still a boy, but you have to respect the fact of how much women do ""love"" him. Now lets switch gears and take a look from the female perspective. The first candidate is Taylor Swift. Now she is pretty much everywhere, and girls look to her as a role model. Her newest song ""Wildest Dreams"" just reaks of Chad all over it. (URL ""He said, ""Let's get out of this town, Drive out of the city, away from the crowds."" I thought heaven can't help me now. Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down He's so tall and handsome as hell He's so bad but he does it so well I can see the end as it begins My one condition is"" Describing everything a woman want's in an alpha, even REALIZING that he could leave at any moment. Tall, handsome, bad, isolating you from the herd; it's what a woman fantasizes about. ""Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress, Staring at the sunset, babe Red lips and rosy cheeks Say you'll see me again Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ha, wildest dreams, ah-ha."" Is it a woman's dream to be remembered as a notch on Chad's belt? All they want is validation and another ride. ""I said, ""No one has to know what we do, "" His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room"" Well they want the AF, without any BB knowing... that's how they can keep the dynamics of their sexual strategy up. ""You'll see me in hindsight Tangled up with you all night Burning it down Someday when you leave me I bet these memories Follow you around"" Yes, she clearly understands the true nature of Chad. Even one of the most successful women want a Chad to just come use them, and all they want is to be a memory. Here is a top notch alpha woman still having her fantasies about an alpha to come use her. The last song I am going to look at is ""Dark Horse"" by Katy Perry. She turned out to be the most successful selling artist of the year. So it's easy to see that most people are listening to what she sings. (URL ""I knew you were You were gonna come to me And here you are But you better choose carefully Cause I, Im capable of anything Of anything and everything"" Ahh, how she know's the allure of a woman can be a dangerous journey. ""Make me your Aphrodite Make me your one and only But dont make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy"" They all want you on lock down, and don't you dare cross them. ""Cause once youre mine, once youre mine Theres no going back"" They know their power over men, and they will use it to their fullest to exploit them. ""Its in the palm of your hand now baby Its a yes or no, no maybe So just be sure before you give it all to me All to me, give it all to me"" Here she shows how men are really the ones who have the power. It is only when we relinquish it to them, do they take everything from us. So understanding The Red Pill, it's easy to understand that betas (and alphas in some cases) give everything up to women. If you aren't careful they will destroy you. These are all popular songs playing to the minds of the masses, hinting at the fringes of The Red Pill/Blue Pill Theory. I think these are good examples to showcase how prevalent things really are, and from what to expect from the younger generations. "
126,vulnerability,TheRedPill,A scientific approach to sexual attraction,135,3s48qf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3s48qf/a_scientific_approach_to_sexual_attraction/,2015-11-09 21:07:27,"**Summary** This post contains some studies which evaluated female reproductive behaviour, mating strategies and mate selection. I focus on a mate selection: * What behavioural patterns are considered attractive? * What facial expression are attractive? * Do you have to be a funny guy? * How does the female preferences ch ange then it comes to short term vs long term intersexual relationships? * How does the menstrual cycle affect a womens perception of the world? **Body** * **Menstrual cycle** [Women's preferences for male behavioral displays change across the menstrual cycle](URL &gt;women's preference for men who displayed social presence and direct intrasexual competitiveness increased on high-fertility days relative to low-fertility days, but only in a short-term, not a long-term, mating context. These findings add to the growing literature indicating that women's mate preferences systematically vary across the reproductive cycle. Besides being physical attractive why are the footplayers considered to very attractive? Because they compete against other men. So go get your girls and take them to watch you competing in sports. Or do it on an intellectual level by for example winning an argument against an arm chair philosopher. Afterwards fuck his girlfriend rough. [Women's sexual interests across the ovulatory cycle depend on primary partner developmental instability.]( URL &gt;Normally ovulating women have been found to report greater sexual attraction to men other than their own partners when near ovulation relative to the luteal phase. One interpretation is that women possess adaptations to be attracted to men possessing (ancestral) markers of genetic fitness when near ovulation, which implies that women's interests should depend on qualities of her partner. In a sample of 54 couples, we found that women whose partners had high developmental instability (high fluctuating asymmetry) had greater attraction to men other than their partners, and less attraction to their own partners, when fertile. If a male in LTR displays low genetic quality like lacking symmetry, a women doesnt even consider to get pregnant with him. During her fertile period shes looking for tingles else where. [Ovulatory shifts in women's attractions to primary partners and other men]( URL &gt;Shifts in women's extra-pair attractions across the cycle were significantly moderated by third-party ratings of partner attractiveness, such that the less attractive the partner was, the more extra-pair attraction women reported at high relative to low fertility (partial r = -.33, p(dir) = .03). In line with previous findings, we found support for the hypothesis that the degree to which a woman's romantic partner displays indicators of high-fitness genes affects women's attractions to their own partner and other men at high fertility. Women lock up betas down in sexless LTR and during their fertile window they can help but get attracted by alphas. The more the male in a relationship lacks fitness, the more the women is drive to a male, who has those high-fitness genes. So at least live up to your genetic potential. [Female attraction to appetitive-aggressive men is modulated by women's menstrual cycle and men's vulnerability to traumatic stress. ](URL &gt; Results indicate that women preferred a soldier high in appetitive aggression as a short-term mate but not as a long-term relationship. This preference for the ""warrior"" was higher for women in their fertile window of the menstrual cycle. We conclude that women in their fertile window prefer men exhibiting higher appetitive aggression as a short-term partner, revealing appetitive aggression in men may serve as a signal for a higher genetic fitness. A warrior is the most masculine clich. From an evolutionary perceptive nothing better than a male, who knows how to kill intruders or wild animals. This traits is all a ovulating women can wish for. [Comparing group dehumanization and intra-sexual competition among normally ovulating women and hormonal contraceptive users.] (URL &gt; Together, these studies demonstrate that dehumanization of women is elicited by menstrual cycle-related processes and associated with women's mate-attraction goals. Dehumanizing, I like that. Have you ever heard a better word to describe two horny women fighting for an alpha? [Do women's mate preferences change across the ovulatory cycle? ]( URL &gt; A prominent hypothesis in this area, the ovulatory shift hypothesis, posits that women experience elevated immediate sexual attraction on high- relative to low-fertility days of the cycle to men with characteristics that reflected genetic quality ancestrally. They confirmed this. Genetic quality equals height, muscles, facial symmetry. Muscles are the one thing you can change. But you can substituted for lacking height or symmetry by choosing the right clothes. * **LTR** [MFF improves marriage](URL I think this can be explained by preselection: Wife sees her husband attracting another women. So if you are in a LTR have some threesomes to improve your relationship. It doesnt matter if your partner has sexual attraction to females. [Sex in long-term relationships: a systemic approach to sexual desire problems]( URL Yeah, people in LTRs have a shitty sex life after some time. * **What is attractive** [Sex and generational differences in desired characteristics in mate selection] &gt;Among the most consistent findings for all seven assessment periods is the high value both sexes place on dependable character, emotional stability/maturity, pleasing disposition, and mutual attraction/love. Men across all assessment periods placed a higher value than women on good health, good cook/housekeeper, and good looks, while women placed a higher value on ambitious/industrious, similar educational background, and good financial prospect. This one is rather boring. On the women side: hypergamy. And men want a partner, whos hot, can cook and is healthy. [ partner salience moderates roller-coaster-induced excitation transfer.]( URL &gt;Ratings of attractiveness and dating desirability toward the photographed individual were higher among persons exiting than entering the ride. So offer another person some thrill makes you more attractive [Reproductive strategy, sexual development and attraction to facial characteristics.]( URL &gt;We find for men, engaging in sex at an early age is related to an increased preference for feminized female faces. Similarly, for women, the earlier the age of first sex the greater the preference for masculinity in opposite-sex faces. Two words on that study: Alpha widow. A girl who started early riding the CC and who got fucked by many Chads continues craving Alpha. &gt;Masculinity in males has also been associated with low investment in mate and offspring. Sure, Chad dont change diapers. [Women's estradiol predicts preference for facial cues of men's testosterone.]( URL &gt; In this research, we demonstrate that women with higher estradiol concentrations exhibit stronger preferences for the faces of men with higher testosterone concentrations, and that women's testosterone preference and estradiol curves track one another across days of the cycle. The findings are the first direct demonstration in humans that hormone concentrations in one sex are associated with attraction to cues of hormonal status in the opposite sex. The results support a functional role for estradiol in calibrating women's mating psychology to indices of their current fertility. A women whos ovulation wants the sperm of masculine man. So increase your testosterone by lifting heavy and dont forget about the zinc supplementation (which is a very common lack of minerals). [Effect of humor on interpersonal attraction and mate selection. ]( URL &gt;Results show that the targets with a good sense of humor received significantly higher ratings of attractiveness and suitability than did those with an average or no sense of humor. Furthermore, male participants rated female targets as significantly more attractive than female participants rated male targets. I never succeed in getting a girl wet by telling jokes. So dont even consider it. But if a girls attracted to you, she going to laugh about any funny comments you make. So use her laughing as an indicator of attraction. [""He loves me, he loves me not . . . "": uncertainty can increase romantic attraction. ]( URL &gt;Participants in the uncertain condition were most attracted to the men-even more attracted than were participants who were told that the men liked them a lot. Uncertain participants reported thinking about the men the most, and this increased their attraction toward the men. Dont tell her that you are attracted to her. Let her hamster spin. A simple compliment like youre beautiful destroys all the sexual tension you carefully built up. Dont do it. [ the impact of emotion expressions on sexual attraction. ]( URL &gt;cross two studies using different images and samples ranging broadly in age (total N = 1041), a large gender difference emerged in the sexual attractiveness of happy displays: happiness was the most attractive female emotion expression, and one of the least attractive in males. In contrast, pride showed the reverse pattern; it was the most attractive male expression, and one of the least attractive in women. Shame displays were relatively attractive in both genders, and, among younger adult women viewers, male shame was more attractive than male happiness, and not substantially less than male pride. Women dont want a man to be happy. So wipe that stupid grin out of your face, lift your chin up, your shoulders back and walk like a king. Look down on people while taking to them. Another word on displaying pride: the pride expression accentuates typically masculine physical features, such as upper body size and muscularity. * **Hooking up** [Sex without emotional involvement]( URL &gt;Even when females voluntarily engaged in low-investment copulation, coitus typically caused them to feel emotionally vulnerable, and to have thoughts expressing anxiety about partners' willingness to invest.  Females' attempts to continue regular coitus when they desired more[ investment than partners were willing to give produced feelings of distress, degradation, and exploitation despite acceptance of liberal sexual moralityhey frequently tested their partners for signs of ability and willingness to invest (e.g., dominance, prowess, jealousy, nurturance) Even if the girl has no sexual moral, she wants Chad to commit to her. If he doesnt do it, shell get frustrated. But this isnt your problem as long as you dont marry a broken CC rider. [Alcohol](URL &gt; indicating that in this condition, stronger expectancies that alcohol increases sexual desire predicted higher attractiveness ratings after suboptimal exposure to alcohol primes. No effects emerged in the intelligence rating condition. Go to the bar and fuck one of this hot and drunk girls. Alcohol also increases risk taking behaviour. **Lessons** * RP is backed up by science * Women are enslaved to their menstrual cycle and have a massive shift in their partner preferences. During high fertile days they crave Chads cock, during low fertile days theyre happy with beta buckers. The less attracte the beta is, the bigger attraction for Chad is. Track womens cycle to understand them better. * For LTRs women want final potent partners, but this doesnt prevent their vaginas from drying up. * Uncertainty about attraction and commitment increases attraction. A men with a happy faces decreases attraction. A pride face increases it. Be arrogant and dont bother telling her, that she is hot. * A pumped and dumped slut still hopes for the males investment in her. "
127,vulnerability,TheRedPill,"What is a positive, masculine spin on ""vulnerability""?",69,3ssgab,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3ssgab/what_is_a_positive_masculine_spin_on_vulnerability/,2015-11-15 02:54:16,"Summary: Men are encouraged not to be vulnerable...I embody that, but almost to a fault. Any advice? Forget women for a second, let's real talk. I've always had a negative view on vulnerability. I was taught to always keep it together, boys don't cry, tough it out. I had a rough childhood, but I grinded it out and got on through my day without ever complaining. I'm often told I'm very friendly, but I'm also often told that I'm distant, unavailable, and in the words of the girl I'm seeing right now, ""inaccessible"". This lifestyle takes a toll on me. I have a lot of trouble getting close to and connecting with people. I'm almost too stoic, reserved, and composed... Almost unrelatable. I have trouble making friends. I know a lot of people, but I'm friends with almost no one. Something about that closeness and intimacy scares me. If something happened to me today, I don't know who I'd call. Hell I'd even feel uncomfortable asking for help, as that'd be a huge demonstration of vulnerability. Something doesn't feel right here. I understand the one extreme where a person victimizes themselves, blames the world for their problems, etc. but I feel like I'm the total opposite (which I believe is equally unhealthy). I refuse to ever cut myself any slack, pressure myself ridiculously, and take responsibility for all of the world's problems. I force myself to ""man up"" all the time. I feel like I should be a bit more vulnerable in some aspects of my life, but I can't find a healthy way to understand and frame my own vulnerability. Right now I reject it, which hasn't been working out great for me. I'd rather figure out a healthy, masculine way of embracing it. Typing all this out and opening up feels a bit healing, yet awkward at the same time. I'm glad I fought through the awkward and did it."
128,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Real Men Don't Cry,0,3tezu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3tezu3/real_men_dont_cry/,2015-11-19 21:11:07,"So I'm new around TRP and this is my first post so tell me if I fuck anything up. I'm 19 a freshman in college and I discovered TRP about a week ago. In that time frame I've read nearly every post and was successfully able to swallow TRP a few days ago. It's been a crazy realization for me realizing I've been very beta-like a lot of my life. I attribute this to my mom being in control of my well-being growing up. My father was her bitch and whenever he tried to teach the best alpha lessons it would seem mommy always put him down (my father suffered from extreme bipolar) and take over parenting. This is not to say my pops did not teach me some good alpha lessons, he did, but the most valuable ones I feel were withheld. Luckily, I didn't end up nearly as beta as my older brother. Bless my mother's soul, but she gave me too many beta attributes. One of these attributes was talking about 'feelings' when I was sad. These talks were the ""cure"" to feeling better, but not actually doing anything about it. This, after swallowing TRP, I have discovered is a no-no. Now I'm not going to claim there is anything wrong with discussing our feelings with others. As I have learned, male vulnerability, especially with other males, is something we should strive for. What I am going to discuss is the risk associated with discussing feelings. Discussion of Feelings = Release from Feelings Correct me if I am wrong but I feel as if that is the most common reason people talk about feelings. However, for a second imagine a male who doesn't discuss how they feel with others. This is a man who is in control of his emotions and does not feel the need to tell others how he feels. His aura and actions display how he wishes to live and he does not need to justify it to anyone else or tell anyone else. I would generalize and say this is a dominant trait in alphas. Betas however love to tell others how they feel about things. It is because they feel the need to be accepted by others that they are so open. They have to be heard. They are taught from childhood that their opinion really does count and people want to hear what they have to say. Often this is opposite from the truth. They want to pour themselves out to other people for justification of their existence. A real man will need no justification and can silently sit in a room and withhold his opinion and/or keep what he feels/thinks inside. This man is living for himself and realizes that his self-worth is not determined by making himself known or understood, but by knowing and understanding himself. I have also found that my greatest successes have come from times I have manned up, not bitched, and just done what I've needed to do. Complaining = Beta. I think that as we learn to master our emotions we can better learn to master ourselves and everything we do. If we better understand ourselves it makes it much easier to focus on what we want, whether it be to get bigger, get more chicks, make a lot of money, or accomplish something else of worth. We can understand that some emotions aren't always necessarily meant to be heard but rather to be used to motivate us. When people speak about themselves it tends bring people a sense of calmness. A feeling like something has just been lifted off their chests. It then makes them lazy and detached from what they want since now they these emotions have been released there is no need to focus on them anymore. Why not use these emotions we have as a power source and source of focus instead of releasing them so we feel better. The alpha can withstand the greatest pressure, the beta cannot. This was just a thought. I don't claim to be right or wrong. I'm still working to better understand the ways of TRP as much as anyone else is."
129,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Response: Girl from OkCupid,0,3tm6px,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3tm6px/response_girl_from_okcupid/,2015-11-21 08:25:07,"I messaged the mods for permission to make a response post to [this post](URL posted yesterday. A few things bothered me about that post. 1. It faked quotes. The title is ""*Girl on OKCupid subreddit keeps telling herself that she's attracted to betas - and then learns that her ""perfect, amazing"" boyfriend is a RedPiller*"". I never once used the word perfect (nor did anyone else), although the post twice quotes me as calling my SO perfect. I did use the word amazing, but only to describe a date night. My SO treats me wonderfully, but he's not perfect - neither am I, or anyone else. I'm far from in love, it's only been a couple months. Cherry picking is hard to avoid on subs, but you shouldn't make things up. 2. Those exaggerations were used to create a false narrative. I wasn't devastated by finding out my ""'perfect, amazing' boyfriend"" read red pill. I mentioned in the post that the advice in that post isn't bad. It's great to appreciate your value and build confidence. The advice there worked - I liked his profile, we went out and wound up dating exclusively. The *reasoning* is concerning. Why improve yourself because women are irrational and need a leader? Improve yourself because you're a human with a life that shouldn't be wasted. Tease because you know she can take it and you appreciate her comebacks. Don't neg because you've perceived some threat to your manhood. The one ideal that does bother me is the idea that guys should ""be manly^TM "", as though ""manly"" has a single definition: get ripped, get sexed, don't trust women with vulnerability. Define it yourself, and *be confident* about it. I don't care if your hobby is DOTA or the violin, as long as it makes you happy and doesn't take over your life. 3. The biggest issue with the post is its point: ""*RedPill is not just about getting big muscles and ramming some chick up the cervix. It's about understanding the nature of the world - that nature contains both alpha and beta traits that you must use in balance if you want a long-term relationship.*"" ###Everyone has alpha and beta traits. That ratio is different in everyone. I like this ratio as it is in my SO. I don't want it to change, because I like that he's dorky and cries at nostalgic movies and gives me sweet compliments and asks me for advice and lets me test nail polish on him. That *doesn't* mean that I dislike his big social circle, how hard he works at school, his sense of humor, his passion for music, his honesty, or his self-confidence. Yeah, I probably wouldn't like a guy at *either* extreme. And yeah, I wish he'd come with me to the gym because it's a hobby of mine (as mentioned in the thread, I go every day). Just like I'm sure he wishes I liked watching football or could sing. It's not a deal breaker. ###If having both alpha and beta traits makes you a red piller, then I'm attracted to red pillers - no one else exists. Edit: Also, though we see each other every day and hang out with each other's friends, we haven't used the terms ""boyfriend"" or ""girlfriend"" officially because it's been 2.5 months since we *met*. Chill, guys! :)"
130,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Keeping tight frame and its limits. A heavyweight frame match...,12,3u315m,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3u315m/keeping_tight_frame_and_its_limits_a_heavyweight/,2015-11-25 01:57:52,"It has been written in this sub (and not just here) that guys women don't like to ""date"" only need to be more bold / show tight frame / behave alpha to become somebodies instead of the usual nobodies. Yesterday I've put this to the test... ___________________________________________________________ I'm somewhat looking for a job and had an interview yesterday. Before technical interview started (programming), I had your usual HR interview where I had to give more information about ""myself"". In most cases, this is just routine, but yesterday's experience was unique. First of all, from the moment we met I realized the dissatisfaction in her eyes (found me unattractive... happened before, nothing unique about it) and knew I'm not going to get free rides from her ass. But... she HAD TO interview me and I HAD TO withstand her shit, so this is where the funny part begins. First of all, I noticed her firm body posture and the way she relates to me: looks straight to my eyes, doesn't flinch a second (very bad signs by the way: she LOATHED me), throws up some useless shit about ""her"" company, places some routine questions and DOESN'T EVEN WAIT for me to answer, being so eager to end the conversation, but at the same time ""put me in my &lt;&lt;underworld&gt;&gt; place"" as much as she could. She was beautiful, young, fit, super-brazen and an obvious carouseler that still had some golden years of alpha cock ahead (a woman ""in her prime""). In her eyes, I was the hunted and she was the hunter (way above ""my league""). In my eyes, she was just a talking un-moistened pussy. The conversation continued with rock-solid frame from BOTH of us. We were brazenly looking into each other eyes, waiting for the other to accept defeat, we were exchanging super-condensed icy conversations. I caught her off guard a few times and for the moment she acted in defeat (looked below, lost frame). Her beauty was her main weapon (and an effective one), the other being a total lack of attraction towards me (an equally effective invulnerability spell). It's rare for women to show no vulnerability, but this one didn't, so... in the end nobody won even though I played my part by the book. ___________________________________________________________ Lesson learnt: 1. Women cannot make distinction between a professional and sexual setting and WILL give you a miserable time if they don't find you attractive (just like outside work). 2. Maintain rock-solid frame is a requirement in entering-exiting hostile interactions undefeated, but gives you absolutely no guarantee you're gonna achieve anything more than that! Only when power balance inclines MUCH to your favour will you be able to bridge the razor-wired fence and get to their moist parts"
131,vulnerability,TheRedPill,"[FR] Forgive me brothers, for I have sinned",179,3u64mh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3u64mh/fr_forgive_me_brothers_for_i_have_sinned/,2015-11-25 14:43:21,"So before I confess to you all my heinous sins, let me give you a little bit of context. A good six months or so ago a ended up ending it with my LTR of 6 months, after moving out of my nice large high-rise studio into a very small studio nearby. Basically I wanted to save up 40k by the end of the year. I was spending wayyyy too much on stupid shit. I was travelling a lot, over paying for an apartment I don't really need, and just wanted to cut back on expenses. After all, my line of work gave me intimate insight into many business books -- I had access to how their ENTIRE operation functions, from cashflow, infrastructure, acquisition, and marketing. So I was in a position where if I saved up enough cash, I could quickly clone any of these many businesses. The idea was to scale back my life style for greater future rewards. **Sin #1** -- Forgoing AWALT. That she'd forgo other options to stick it out. That by me changing, she'd accept it. As you can imagine, she left me on some bitter terms. Tried to explain it wasn't about my lifestyle change, but people growing apart or some shit. But I knew what it was about. I noticed when the change started happening. And don't get me wrong, I don't think this is a solid case of AWALT, but having these lifestyle changes definitely diminish your situation and create a tougher game for yourself. Sure, not ALL girls are like that, however, it's always just going to be the most rational thing to play it like they are, because best worst case scenario, you keep frame and everything balanced, best case, she isn't actually like that -- but it doesn't matter, because you treated it like AWALT and therefor the challenge never even occurred. Anyways, I decided it was a good time to take a break from women, and just focus on work. My social life the next six months, was pretty much just with work friends, work, light gambling every now and then, and occasionally getting really hammered at some random bar. But no real attempt at doing much other than save money. **Sin #2** -- Giving up an active lifestyle. Even in monk mode, it's important to keep a lifestyle of activity up to some degree. I'm now learning this, because you start to get rusty. I'll learn this the hard way later. But what I should have still been doing was getting out, and still being active. While I should have still avoided relationships and the likes, I should have still stuck with doing weekend activities like joining a hiking group, or MMA classes, while avoiding just fucking around with work friends. I think this is one really overlooked part of going monk. Is yeah, you may have some goals you want to achieve, but it's important to stay sharp, and use that time to keep developing the other aspects of your life. For me, it was just about saving up money. But I should have also been developing other aspects of my lifestyle while I was at it. -------------------------------- So a few months into this, I'm realizing I may have fucked up and let the ball drop a bit. Too focused on work and money, and not enough focused on rounding myself out while I stay low. ------------------------------- **Brothers this following part is why I'm writing this post** ------------------------------- *I've been part of PUA for maybe 3 months before finding TRP back in 2012. I've been here a while. And you'd think I'd have everything down pretty hard by now, which I typically do, but what I'm about to tell you is how I literally fucked up everything I've learned and preached in the past, by completely disregarding it by being caught off guard and rusty. I also think it's important that even EC's who've been doing this a while are prone to mistakes, and I think they should be discussed.* So I get back into the gym, and start going out occasionally to pick up chicks. It's hit or miss; a bit rusty. But I score dates every now and then, none of which I found caliber to go beyond a casual hook up. The pussy I was getting really wasn't worth the effort. One thing I found interesting was how hard really ""faking it till you make it"" is. It's really, really, difficult having an abundance mentality when you don't actually have an abundance. It's one thing to logically think, ""Okay don't invest too much into this interaction, who gives a shit how it ends up"" but once you actually start gaining some traction, it's hard not to think, ""Oh don't fuck this up, you have no quality backups to fall onto tonight."" No matter what, a little part of your brain is going to tell you after a small failure, ""Fuck it dude, try another tactic, something is bound to work,"" which naturally starts creating a feedback loop of desperation. I learned this lesson a good 2 months ago. I was at a concert after losing some friends and just started chatting up whoever late into the event. And had a blast. I was getting back into my groove, teasing girls, doing some light kissing here and there, and just sort of going with the flow and not really concerned where the night took me. I was sharpening up and getting into the natural rhythm of things. This eventually lead into meeting up with some people who brought me back to a celebrity's little entourage and compound of sort. Everyone there was super chill, and I was still not really giving a flying fuck about what happened -- just chatting up anyone and everyone. That was until the HB9 sexy traveler who claims to be ""22"" (BS) started getting flirty with me 1 on 1 and dropping heavy IOIs. ""Okay"" I think to myself, ""Haven't had a 9 get this aggressive in a while. This is good. I know this game well; let's play."" And I'm really getting her attention, so much so that some random dude starts to get closer to our conversation and occasionally dropping in... ""Alright, got an AMOG. I got it."" At this point, the game is in full swing, and I'm very aware of it. **Sin #3** Overthinking things. If you start to over think things, it takes you out of your own frame, and into theirs. It creates a feedback loop. You will start becoming more concerned with how you should react, and how they react in response. ""What's a good witty reply? How do I get her attention back? Okay, I lost that shit test, what's a good way to quickly regain my ground"" All these things start to build up, and now you've removed all of your own personal sovereignty by REACTING to the actions of every one else around you. (Side note: Watch your alcohol intake. Booze can really push you in either direction. But when you aren't on point, it's just going to slow you down and dull your edges, likely making it harder for yourself because you WILL get sloppy) Eventually this set started to crumble. I was too desperate for the HB9, that I starting trying too hard. I was too focused on ""what was right"" rather than just going with it. It all ended when the girl who was really into me at first, started slowly flirting with the other guy, and it started to become clear, I was losing out. So I cut my losses, swiped a bottle of wine, and took an Uber home right as sun was rising. **Sin #4** Putting the pussy on the pedestal. This was my big fuck up. I know, I know, it's fucking RP 101... Anyways I have a pretty awesome ex who I thought would be a good chick to call up. She legitimately is a really good person, but I made the mistake of, once again, forgoing AWALT. Due to our past, I figured I wouldn't have to play too many games, and she'd be a good person to try and spark things up with again. Turns out, she got super hot, and literally checks off every little box in the type of woman I like. ""Awww fuck..."" If the HB9 from is any indicator, I'm sure you can imagine how this story will go. Right out the gate, I'm hooked: Big fuck up. We go out, and I'm all fucking over her like white on rice. I figure, ""Hey she left me in the past for being too cocky and a bit of a douchebag, I'm in the power position here. I can move as fast as I want and she'll be grateful."" Again, TRP 101 shit right here I'm fucking up. In the past, I had all the cards, and all the moves. She could have left me at any moment, and I wouldn't have given a shit. I could say and do what I wanted with impunity."" But this time, with a little help from some unbalanced hormones in my blood, I decided to go with Manson's ""Models"" method on vulnerability. **Sin #5** Showing the cards in your hand. In retrospect I just went with that method because I was acting like a thirsty fool who wanted to rationalize his decisions. For those unfamiliar, he suggests being 100% vulnerable as a sign of strength and security. To completely let the other person know your intents... To leave no room for ambiguity by completely polarizing the situation. That she knows exactly where you stand, and she can either take the offer or leave. Which works great if you've really built yourself up in her eyes. But if you've yet to fully establish yourself where you want to be, it'll backfire, as I learned. So that night I made it clear, and polarized it. I gave up all my cards. I told her I thought she was great, didn't play games, I liked her, and want to try things out again. She gets all cute, agreed, and we sleep together. Seems good, right? Nope. Next day, she leaves, and goes fucking silent. Completely stonewalled. Sure some texts here and there, but nothing really affectionate. I started to realize, I gave up all my cards. I gave her the power. There is now absolutely NO room for a takeaway nor dreadgame. She knows exactly where I stand, and the ambiguity is gone. And as we all know, when a guy gives up his power, he may as well just cut off his dick and turn it into a Barbie doll. She had all the power. By going in too fast, I removed her ability to crave me, which is what she wants. At that point, it became impossible for her to be able to desire my attention and affection, because she doesn't have to chase me or think about what my real motives and position is. She knows. Women want to watch a movie over and over again, trying to figure out what it's all about. That's all the fun for them. But instead, after one play through, I told her what the movie was about and ruined the excitement of figuring out the puzzle. ---------------------------- Lessons learned: ----------------------------- Stay sharp: This is my big fuck up. I started slacking. In retrospect I shouldn't have had such a dramatic lifestyle change... I should have still kept up on my game and plates to some degree. Sure, maybe not necessarily date or plate women, but definitely keep enough gaming going on to maintain that psychological abundance... You need to know you still have it. And at the very least, I should have kept up on my outside activities that didn't involve work. Abundance: I'm sorry, but I learned from coming out of monk mode that abundance is hard to fake. Figure out a way to keep it. Right now, I'm going to latter it up. I am dating once or twice a week with a wide range of girls, as well as hitting up old dusty plates I typically wanted gone. But I need to build that abundance again to restart that positive feedback loop. Got a second date with a sexy as fuck 19 year old next week, so hopefully that'll pay off. AWALT: The game is always being played. Always. No matter what you want to believe, it's being played. TRP may sound a little too fucking much at times, but it's just the fucking case. Women are women, and nothing is going to change that. No matter how intelligent you think she is, she still has estrogen and a female brain. They will ALL act like women, no matter what. If you get sloppy, you will lose. Keeping my cards hidden: I was a dummy for forgoing the basics. People play the game because it's fun. Not only that, but giving up your hand ruins it for all parties involved: You lose your power position, and they already know what you're going to do. "
132,vulnerability,TheRedPill,[FR] Incel goes to a bar,201,3murh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3murh5/fr_incel_goes_to_a_bar/,2015-09-30 03:02:11,"**Summary:** Barely kissed, 26 years old virgin goes to a bar and approaches girls for the first time in his life. Doesnt get crushed. **Warning:** Long as fuck. **Body:** I am 26yo, 192cm (about 6ft3in) tall european guy. I grew up with limited to none interactions with opposite gender (non-family, that is). I almost literally ran away twice during my early teens when spoken to by a girl my age. I am currently unemployed (never really was, went straight to health issues (that eventually led to chemo) after college; welfare + beer money thing on the side is what sustains me) and I still live with my parents. My clothing choices could be better. Thats just to paint the picture for you. Even with my negative SMV I know what I want and getting laid at least once in my life is one of those things. I am still hesitant to go to professionals, although I was encouraged to by (higher SMV) friends of mine. Last Thursday I got another clearance from my Doc, so after wasting away the whole summer (previous check-up was in May) I started to hyping myself up to go to a bar. Getting over my social anxiety is a constant struggle for me. Anyway, I found out that they finally play Straight Outta Compton in a cinema here in 18:30  21:00 timeslot on Friday. After seeing good movie in a cinema I am always pumped up to take on the world, but I never do. This also helped me to pass the where do you go? question from parents with to a pub without any awkward follow ups, which would happen if I uncharacteristically said bar, or went off later in the night (I didnt want to go to a bar at 19:00, going after the movie was more optimal). Or at least I think they would happen, but it may all be only in my head After a day and a half of my mind trying to find a reason not to go I didnt find any. Also I wanted to see that movie, so that was that. I went and enjoyed it. My chosen destination was nearby, which was supposed to prevent me from flaking. And as I was getting closer I was doubting my decision so much that I went straight by and continued about 150m down the street. Thats when I finally convinced myself that its bullshit, I am already here, I can at least go in, get a drink, do some recon and see how the atmosphere there looks like for when I go in next time. Baby steps. After a slow walk back I went in and got old-fashioned. With it in my hand I walked around the place before sitting and pulling up my phone in an effort to come up with a plan of action and not to look so weird by just standing there. I am not sure what I expected, but there was no not-so-hot girl, all of them were way out of my league (at least if they knew all details about me) and objectively attractive (and in groups). There was one girl uncharacteristically alone buried in her phone, so I walk to her and then continue and turn around a wall so she doesnt see me. I am already at the bar, I can as well talk to someone and she seemed as the best option to make an approach. So I take two deep breaths and go back. I open with Isnt it boring to be here alone?, to which she quickly points to her (girl)friend (roommate) that is getting their drinks not sure how visible in my face was my internal fuck, but she says ok and introduces herself and we start to chat about where we are from and why I am there alone My on the spot made up story about a friend who abandoned me, because his girlfriend didnt let him go bites me in the ass shortly after, when this blonde, cheerful girl (lets call her Angie, I forgot her name anyway) re-tells what she knows about me to her black haired, assertive and dominant roommate (I will call her Dana, not her real name). Dana cuts the bullshit and informs me that they dont listen to sob stories. Fair enough, chat continues between the three of us. I spent a bit too much time on our places of origin (they werent born in the city we are in, but both live here for some time). When talking about our jobs I promote my part time gig involving PCs into an IT job that is not generic and I appear to be enthusiastic about, which gets positive reactions. We get over Dana liking to travel, how Syria was beautiful years ago and that the migration is not the best topic for a Friday night and that leads to my hobbies. I can hardly impress the female gender with the hours spent playing FM2014 and what not. So I remember something I read/heard on the internet, how you should establish that you are sexual, amused mastery and such, and so I go with kind of a joke my hobbies are: chess, gardening and fucking in the restrooms. Now, I get weird when talking about sexual topics with anyone, let alone two hot chicks I just met. Normally, I would instead continue the small talk and left at the first opportunity. Now imagine how I am losing the rest of the color in my face, when Dana asks to repeat myself, because its loud there and I need to get closer. There is no backing off, so I repeat the joke with a smirk on my face, internally screaming. And they laugh. Both of them. Sure, Dana (clear alpha female of the two, although I found smiling Angie more attractive, if Dana was the one alone, Id probably be too intimidated and didnt approach at all) gives me slight SMV check saying I may be in the wrong company for that. Still with a smile on my face I mumble We will see. and conversation continues. Silent moments start to creep up, as I dont have too much to talk about and my general conversational skills suck. At one point I call Dana out about her quiz-like questioning, which Angie finds hilarious and Dana tries immediately to apologize. As I finish my drink, Dana suggests: go get another drink and, well, if you want, you know where to find us. I take my hint (I would have left anyway, it let nowhere), tell them to have fun and leave. I get my second drink but after scanning the situation I decide to drink it quickly and leave. Now, I know from other fields of my interest, that this is a bad practice. I should have tried to make more approaches, but I decided to have this one night with one approach as a confidence builder for the future and not to taint it with the inevitable crash and burn experiences, which I fear so much. On my way home, I briefly considered going to another, more discotheque-like place, but decided against it. **Lessons learned:** Probably nothing for a general readership of this sub, but a few personal. - dont paint yourself as a victim, not even for a second (I am far from the level where I could entertain the weakness vs. vulnerability discussion) - other people have absolutely no clue about your own struggles, unless they are obvious or presented to them, no reason to disqualify myself without even trying - I, in fact, can walk up to a woman and strike up a conversation - I can get away with more sexual language - getting a job and moving out would do wonders to my confidence - I need to work on my conversational skills in general - my written English is worse than I previously thought "

With Valentine's Day two short weeks away, some of your girlfriends are no doubt ratcheting up the pressure on you to pop the question on the most romantic day of the year. Maybe you already live together. Maybe you've been going out for a few years. Maybe you met her in a Chelsea dive bar on Tuesday. It's no matter. They all want the same thing. Allow me to introduce Charles Brandes. Sure, he's a big shot today pulling in an estimated $16 million a month, but he wasn't always. He was once just a young monkey like all of you. And therein lies his cautionary tale. For it was at that point in his career that he met Linda King Formo, a single mother earning $6 an hour as a librarian. Brandes started his own firm in 1974 and was content to grow his AUM over the subsequent decade. He met Formo in 1983 and, after a three-year courtship, they were married in 1986. Even though he wasn't a BSD yet (he made about $180,000 in 1986), he obviously went into the marriage with some reservations, evidenced by the pre-nuptial agreement he presented to her which she refused to sign. Let me say that again for the cheap seats, because it's important that you get it. He presented her with a pre-nuptial agreement and she refused to sign it. She allegedly told him at some point before the wedding that, ""I will have no claim or interest in your business"", but she denies ever saying it and it's impossible to prove and not legally binding anyway. Fast forward 18 years to 2004. The marriage is over, and they're in divorce court. Charles is now a very big deal, and the lifestyle he has lavished on Linda could be described as over the top by any sane measure. By California statutes, he can only be forced to pay her $36,400 per month in spousal support but, either out of genuine concern for his soon-to-be ex-wife or his desire to head her off at the legal entanglement pass, Charles gives her a home in Rancho Santa Fe, a beach house in Del Mar, a Central Park penthouse and two other Manhattan condos, and two condos in Salt Lake City. To alleviate any liquidity concerns she might have, he throws in $18.7 million in cash. Guess what? It's not enough. The interest alone on the money he gave her generates $155,000 a month. He throws another $350,000 a month into the pot, bringing her monthly income to a staggering $500,000. But she's just scraping by, and has now set her sights on the $140 million he has in various S-Corporations. The reason she can't make ends meet? $30,000 a month at the casinos $340,000 Mercedes Maybach Upkeep on her various mansions The 210 pairs of shoes in her closet Half a million a month doesn't go as far as it used to, yo Just so you don't think she's not deserving, she'll tell you she was instrumental in his success. How? She convinced him to dress better, get a nose job, and she busted his balls to work harder 'cause mama needs new shoes. Guys, I hope you see where I'm going with this. You might be worthless today, but chances are you won't always be. You pay for car insurance, health insurance, life insurance (if you don't, you should). Why would you leave such an obvious financial vulnerability unprotected? The best advice I can give is don't get married. Ever. There's just no percentage in it for a young guy with significant earning potential. Especially if there's a major income disparity between you and your significant other (hedge fund manager vs. $6 an hour librarian). But I've been married three times myself. Just so I don't sound like a hypocrite, if you must get married - by all means protect yourself. A pre-nup doesn't mean you love little Susie Rottencrotch any less. And she won't hesitate to sign it, if her intentions are pure. If she does hesitate, that should tell you something. Have a great weekend, guys, and don't fall into the Valentine's Day trap. "

Your eyes hurt because you have never used them before. Your head hurts doubly, triply, because your first instinct is to look back at your past failings with the fairer sex and see more mistakes than ever. Quite soon after perusing this corner of the Internet, you see all of them at once. This powerful new knowledge is a spotlight, throwing your every historical failing with women into sharp relief. You realise that you have always been putting in what is objectively an abysmal, laughable effort to get what you desired. Not only did you fail; you now know that most of your failed gambits in fact drew the scorn, contempt, even the *revulsion* of those women, whereas, in the dark times, all you knew was that it didn't quite work, or that a harsh rejection was a reflection of her character rather than your inefficacy. It is as though you are suddenly hearing these women disparage you. Now you know that they thought you were pathetic, a creep, some disgusting imitation of a human. It's as though their voices have all suddenly reached you as one in a deafening, embarrassing, confrontational crescendo echoing ""You are not a man!"". You did not deviate. You followed the official method. You found it hard to grapple with the vague advice meted out by all around you, even by some of the women you chased; ""Be yourself, be nice, be kind and sensitive. Don't be a dick."", but you tried your best to make it work. Your nervous smile and supplicating acts drew smirks, raised eyebrows and garnered rejections every single time and yet you had always, somehow, *once again* found the one bad woman who didn't deserve nice, sweet, desirable you. You were given bad information and it imprisoned you behind glass, a firmer barrier the more you wanted to breach it. Now the glass has shattered and you are drowning in the freezing air. And this makes any decent man angry. The only way it wouldn't hurt your pride deeply is if you had none at all, and man is ever a prideful creature. Well, now you know exactly why you failed. You know exactly what they thought of you, and why they chose what you saw as a lesser man instead - Chad. Chad Thundercock. He didn't even seem like he wanted what fell into his lap. He didn't seem like he appreciated it, and he abused it. He treated it as worthless, damaging those precious girls you so desired to protect. That, clearly, is what they wanted. So, now you can give them what they want. You can be the one to treat them as worthless, to use them as a utility. To dismiss their charm, their emphatic feelings and their vulnerability with a leer or a sharp comment. After years of asking politely for it, the temptation, now that it is finally available, is to snatch at it, loudly enjoy it and then throw it away with all your might. If that's what they want, that's what they'll get. This will work in certain contexts. It will work on women who just want sex today, on young women, desperate women and women with low self esteem. You can accrue a large number of them, one after the other or several at once. And that on its own is not only a pleasure of manhood, it is a right of passage; the accruing of sexual conquests. In fact, for a man to truly master his interactions with women, it is completely **mandatory.** But the anger at your deluded upbringing, the bitterness of your failed conquests, the buried jealousy of the men who took your women for their own will eat you alive and poison any meaningful interactions with women. It must be cut out, and you will bleed fury, at first. **It is a necessary part of your journey.** You do this in the gym - the iron can take it. It's the purpose of the iron, its duty, its fate. You control and subdue the anger until you are alone with the iron and then you vent every furious remark, every stab of jealousy and swallowed lament into the bar. Over and over, your therapy makes you stronger. It makes you a bigger, better, tougher man. It is not the proper place to put it upon the shoulders of women; they are not strong enough. It is certainly not the proper place to put it on the minds of women; they are incapable bearing such adversity. And pitiful is he who places his pain, his anger and his outrage on another man who is not responsible. This is treason against the only creed to unite us all on here; that of manhood. The very lowest form a man can take. Only once you can take women as they come can you possibly give them anything more than mechanical stimulation. You will find, especially in modern times, that you hardly ever meet any women to whom you *wish* to give more. Plenty who might once have fit that mold have been ruined by society before you had the chance of meeting them. This will, and ought to, make you angry. **You take it out on the iron.** Rather than giving to these women, you take what you want when they offer it up and then you leave. **Your negative emotions are an immensely powerful tool for self-improvement; why squander them on such creatures?** You do not need to pity women. To do so is to regard them as broken, deficient men, which is precisely the flawed premise which is ruining Western society. You know this. You do not need to hate women. Their hypergamy is beyond both their control and their consciousness, and without it, none of us would exist. You know this. You do not need to scorn women. Their minds are not like yours, this you know as a fact and to be angered by fact is to be angered by mathematical theorems, by logic, by what simply *is*. You do not need to control women. If they wish to leave, you would only corrupt them and yourself by forcing them to stay. Besides, there are 3,500,000,000 of them, you will find another. It will take time to fully divest yourself of the anger. You cannot neglect your therapy - the iron - until you can accept that, ugly as it may seem, hypergamy, branch-swinging, fitness testing, comfort testing, solipsism, rationalising, last minute resistance, pre-selection, as well as a fickle scorn for real value over fleeting comfort **are all simply what makes a woman. They cannot control it, they do not will it. You should not wish to change it, for to it you owe your very existence.** Modern society has given them too much responsibility, but you won't. It has lowered its standards for them, but you won't. It has contorted their natures, but you will bring out their femininity and if ever it fails, you get better and move on. You realise that they don't know that they want, but *you* do. From this, you get the satisfaction of knowing that you live a clean, honest life, stoic and unburdened. You are a winner and winners do not focus on negatives, they go from one positive to another. You see things as they are and you treat them accordingly; the outer world does not care for your emotions. This is how you step fully over the threshold into manhood, take a breath, and *start marching forward*. "
136,vulnerability,TheRedPill,gaming as hunting,4,3p0ene,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3p0ene/gaming_as_hunting/,2015-10-17 04:03:01,"For me, relationship between man and woman can be described as an act of hunting. The more experienced you get, the more you are able to find out subtle weaknesses to exploit for your advantage. The less experienced you are, you startle the prey no matter how close it gets. The words below are the summation of my personal experience in the field. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ First of all, hunters select game based on two criterias (in that order): 1. prey vulnerability (in our case, how vulnerable woman is to hunter) 2. prey quality (in our case, how good looking / attractive woman is) Point #2 being obvious, let us concentrate on point #1. Women become vulnerable to you in three ways: 1. by nature (she finds you attractive by default) 2. by context (she finds you attractive after being charmed) 3. by fear (she finds you attractive because you are dangerous) Point #2 above has been extensively discussed here (becoming attractive by ""simply"" raising your SMV, learning gaming skills). It is the most difficult of all: it requires controlling your behaviour to a very large degree, which is something few people do. I would venture to say those that succeed in this type of hunting are the very same with an innate ability for verbal gymnastics and social intelligence. I, along with many people that post here, happen to lack both! I have no biological understanding of social dynamics, nor am I capable to say anything but the truth. So what are people like me do? Simply move along... Point #3 has seldom been addressed in this forum, but it is a super-powerful and wholly natural way to secure prey that would normally be off limits to you (either because she finds you ugly or because you have no social value or whatever). I love this technique because it fits me like a glove (I love to dominate), had massive success whenever I applied it, so why not sharing it with larger public? This hunting technique has three prerequisites: 1. your prey must have no social backing (imagine the risk lions take to eat buffaloes when latter have herds to back them up) 2. your desire to have her must be honest (if you are just faking it to get your oneitis it won't work) 3. your prey must be weaker than you (I am disgusted by masculine/vulgar/""experienced"" women, so I never approached someone that wasn't feminine and weaker) It involves following steps: 1. selection (look for a woman you like and weak enough to overpower by STRENGTH OF WILL ONLY: ignore indicators of disinterest) 2. approach (approach her immediately, start ""kino"" right away, ignore resistance, remain ABSOLUTELY composed and dedicated to your purpose of fucking her). Her only other option is to leave, which is OK (she has that right!*)... 3. wait until she feels ""trapped"" by your presence and starts to ooze indicators of attraction (TEMPORARILY you become attractive by simply having her dominated) 4. extract &amp; fuck the shit out of her 5. leave (because the moment she ""wakes up"" you once again become the very same unattractive guy she never wanted to fuck in the first place) (*) Sometimes this aggressive hunting strategy is applied as POACHING. Women are overpowered through violence and never have the right to leave an interaction! That indeed is rape! Point #1 is the inversion of point #3 in the sense that now she WANTS to be your prey (as opposed to YOU wanting HER to be your prey as in point #3). Because she wants to be your prey, she advertises her vulnerability before you. Your presence always has an aura (reflecting in her behaviour): her actions become erratic whenever you are present, the closer you are to her, the more vulnerable she reacts (check on tell tale reactions such as waving her hair to attract your precious attention, quick but powerful glances, submissive position of head as opposed to shoulders). She just CAN'T be composed when you are present and will NEVER ""dare"" to look straight to your eyes. Whenever you look at her, she will avoid eye contact by looking below and (usually) frantically waving her hair. It means ""come to me, I am weak!"". The funny thing is that if/when you approach her, sometimes she feels too vulnerable and deflects by saying nasty things to you. IGNORE THAT! Concentrate on the body language alone: if it follows above pattern, you can just ignore all words and let her feel even more vulnerable. You will become even more attractive by not being wounded*. With these kinds of women it's OK to have a symbiotic relationship: as long as she feels you are her hunter, things can continue safely into a LTR (it's as if you recreate the hunting ritual on a daily basis). (*) Up until recently, I always felt wounded and ran of them to the surface of Mars to lament my precious ego for YEARS. I can't tell you how much I regret this: I've lost loads of precious cargo just because I was a weak fuck!!! Do NOT act like me! ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In the end, all acts of hunting are measured by their success. So any strategy is valid, as long as it secures prey. "
137,vulnerability,TheRedPill,You are not fully experiencing the moment? You are not drawing anyone into your frame.,63,3pnm5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3pnm5t/you_are_not_fully_experiencing_the_moment_you_are/,2015-10-22 04:02:47,"**Summary**: Everyone assumes they fully experience each moment, but few put forth the attention and willful volition necessary to really be here now confidently, vulnerably, and affectedly. **Body**: You constantly find yourself cresting the waves of another person's train of thought/conversation/statement of purpose. You back out of the way to allow their frame to dominate so that you can comfortably go with the flow. It's the identity you feel comfortable with, the one where no one gets uncomfortable around you and everyone feels ""ok."" You're a pussy. Most people are. This is the way women experience the moment. They expect men to carry them away into flights of fancy, energetic motions, adventure. So if you ""go with the flow"" you are as good as womanized. You're just waiting for her or someone else to get you all jazzed up, get your motor running, because you won't put forth the effort to do it yourself. This is where most self-help texts, motivational speakers, and gurus change the subject. They say, ""Get motivated, stupid."" Then move on. ""Think about all that shit you want, then get going."" What they don't realize is motivation is born in the moment, from whoever is most affected by what's going on, and that is always the person who is paying the most attention. I'll repeat: ---------------------- The person who is most open, willfully paying attention and invested, and therefore most affected by what's happening right now, is the most energetic - the most motivated - the least comfortable - and the most interesting. ----------------------------------- Don't believe me? Go watch a group comedy show. Take a few guesses as to what's happening. ""Funny people are being funny. People are laughing."" How are those people being funny? They're paying extreme attention to one another, anticipating each other's moves, reading body language, leaning into uncomfortable pauses, and expressing body language and emotion in place of reason/logic. They're interesting as fuck and they're uncomfortable. But discomfort is a small price to pay for being in the zone so much that you've got 100 or 1,000 people swept off their feet. Those people in the audience? That woman sitting in front of you? They're waiting. They spend every day waiting for that energy, that purpose, that spark of interesting vulnerability that comes from someone who is brave enough to be fully affected. The greatest gift you can give yourself in this irony-drenched, emotionally blunted culture is to be fully affected by something. Voices are in your head all the time making excuses. They're making excuses right now about why it's ok to make excuses. That's how drugged out of the moment you are. Make a pact with yourself right now: **You will never be ok again.** You won't be sad. You'll be goddamn devastated. You won't be happy, you'll be joyous as fuck. You won't be motivated, you'll be raging. You won't fuck a woman, you'll sex the goddamn shit out of her until her entire life has changed. You won't read a book, you'll absorb and let it fucking change you. You won't listen to someone talk about their day, you'll dive in and live the shit out of it with them. You won't see another person standing in front of you, you'll see yourself and the connectivity of all things in this very moment and collapse the illusion that anything or anyone is ever separate. We all want/need/love the same thing - to be carried away by a sense of purpose so strong that it absolutely cannot be stopped. Guess how many times that happens in a normal person's life, while they sit waiting for it, not realizing it was sitting there within in them held down by boring ass common excuses? Maybe never. A person who learns only by experience, who never ups their focus and willfulness to be attentive in the moment, will reach the foothills of human experience before they die. A person who learns by allowing in discomfort, by breathing in all the shit that everyone else is scared of and then using that mess to power their nuclear sense of will, that person will reach the peak and then find a way into space. **Lesson**: If you're not fully affected by the raw experience of the moment, you're living in pieces and not as a whole and just like everyone else: uninterested and therefore uninteresting."

In a state of feminine social primacy men discussing new definitions of masculinity is always a proposition of men chasing their own tails, but the ambiguity of that question is a calculated one. Men are encouraged to continually attempt to answer what is manhood?, but the touchy-feely equalist appropriate answer is never one defined by the men asking it; the answer is always provided to them and this is always whatever serves women the best. Their confused state is a deliberate perpetual one. As I stated in Vulnerability the narrative of the Feminine Imperative about masculinity is one thats based falsehoods. If men define masculinity for themselves, and that definition serves mens exclusive interests it is equated with posing or a front men falsely wear to mask the real masculinity that feminine primacy has ordained as legitimate. So even when men collectively compare notes and prioritize their needs and their sexual strategy in the context of a legitimate definition of masculinity, the social narrative of feminism and feminine primacy readily disqualifies it as a being a macho bravado worn by men to cover their real vulnerable sensitive feminine-corrected egos provided for them by the imperative. One of the ways of determining whether the propaganda youve dropped from the planes is sinking into the general populace is that your language, your narrative and your public relations material is willfully being professed by the people you hope to conquer. To say Powell is a Vichy Male wouldnt do his obliviousness to being so credit. Powell is a testament to the degree to which feminine-primary, feminine-correct thought has saturated into men confused about their own masculinity, and the feminine correct definitions of it hes ready to evangelize."

The video documents the circumstances that got him this opportunity, their date, and his These circumstances alone dont make him a loser, but his behaviours throughout the video do. [Obviously NSFW video.](URL ---------------- **BODY:** Worth noting his behaviours in the interview that give him away as a loser. These are traits he likely exhibits in interactions with all people. A lot of them reflect his poor self-confidence and low value. Ive listed the main things here, but anyone who watches the video should see more. * Has no real standards or preferences in women. Gives impression he is down for anything with a pulse. &gt; She has to have a pretty face. She has to have a nice body. Not too fat, not too skinny, yknow; shaped. Voluptuous like a real woman. [later] I like blonde girls, I also like brunettes, actually. Color of hair doesnt matter to me as long as she has a pretty face. * Poor clothing which also conceals his body. Admittedly he is horribly out of shape, but his choice of clothing emphasizes his insecurity about it. This vulnerability is again shown when he tries to stay covered while having sex. * Poor posture maintained throughout the video and his date is stooped and cowardly. When he first sits down with the pornstar, he keeps his hands crossed, and when these arent crossed its his legs. This is a submissive stance, and he keeps it throughout the video. * Keeps speaking about how 'pretty' and 'nice' she is. Seems to think that giving out cheap compliments builds attraction. * Makes excuses for not having GF ""girls are snobby. I didn't have nice car.""  He blames the standards of others for himself being deemed unattractive. &gt; Just havent found the right girl yet, yknow. * Asks weird shit. Out of context. Evidently tries hard to make conversation / impress. * No real activities or interests: &gt;Im outgoing, sometimes Im not. Im smart. I like to go out and have fun. Hard worker. &gt; I like to go out, yknow, watch movies, umm maybe go to dance clubs, umm, go to the beach, long walks at night with a nice girl like you heuheu. * Advertises his ingrained beta values: &gt;A good date for me would be picking the girl up, getting some flowers or roses for her. Go out to a nice place and have a nice dinner. * Speaks about personal fuck ups - credit card debt. You couldnt script this shit. * Asks for permission - to smell her arm, to put his arm around her. What harm does he think would come to himself if he was so bold as to just act on it. * Kisses her feet in public and then sucks toes in private. Disgusting. I am not going to analyse the rest of it, but a lot of the same is reflected. Doesn't have confidence to be direct. Gives off spineless loser vibe. ----------------- **Lessons** in this video are not direct tips, but they offer some insight into how you present yourself and the impression it makes on the people around you. If you exhibit weak behaviours, its how people will perceive you."

Corollary: The comfort stage of game should not be neglected. Game relevance: The optimal game strategy is neither All Push nor All Pull, but Push and Pull working in concert to create delightful, tingle-generating uncertainty. Game relevance: Relationship dread increases emotional attachment. Rule #1: Dont do couples costumes. Rule #1: Dont get defensive. Rule #2: Dont Force Conversation Topics. Rule #3: Dont ask questions when you can make statements instead. Maxim #something or other: Never listen to what a women says she prefers in men; instead, watch what she does. Maxim #1: Game is learned charisma, streamlined seduction. Game is as sincere as its practitioners intent. Maxim #1a: Women desire men of better quality than themselves. Maxim #1(a)(2): Men want to be turned on by their women. Women want to be proud of their men. Maxim #2: All successful seductions are adversarial in nature. Maxim #2: Women are turned on by displays of male power. Striking in anger or contempt or disciplinary scorn is one such form of power. Maxim #3: In the state of nature, men are expendable. Maxim #3: Bang first, befriend later. Maxim #3: Some human beings are worth more than others, despite their equality under the law. Maxim #3: Whenever an attractive girl tells you she hates assholes, or describes her experience in the past dating assholes and claims to avoid them now, or recites a laundry list of asshole-y things guys do that she disapproves of, you can bet your weight in gold bricks that she needs you to be an asshole to her. Maxim #4: Trust no one missing a sense of humor. Maxim #5: A mans looks dont matter as much to women as a womans looks matter to men. Maxim #5: Charisma before silence, silence before self-incrimination. Maxim #6: Never Make It Easy For A Girl Maxim #7: Your girl will thank you for your steadfast devotion to your belief in yourself. Maxim #7: The greater the age difference between the older man and the younger woman, the tighter his game will need to be, barring compensatory attributes. Maxim #7: The sweeter and more innocent a girl seems, the greater the likelihood she has been in a gangbang. Corollary to Maxim #7: Always assume she is a whore. It helps kick the legs out from under the pedestal you will be tempted to put her on, and it is more often than not true. Maxim #8: Marriage is a social mechanism designed to exchange sex for indentured servitude. Maxim #10: Its pussy wetness uber alles. Maxim #11: The greater the sexual market value disparity between the husband and his depreciating wife, and the more kids they have, the more life the husband has sucked out of him. Maxim #12: The cumulative experience with hot women imbues the womanizer with a genuinely aloof aura that attracts even more women to him. Corollary to Maxim #12: If you dont have an adequate amount of aloofness-inducing experience with hot women, act like you do. Maxim #12: If you are comfortable with your game being splashed across a JumboTron for thousands of people to read, then you are doing it right. Maxim #13: When in doubt, game. Maxim #13: When the love is gone, women can be as cold as if they had never known you. Maxim #13: Calling a girl out on her lie accomplishes nothing. Maxim #14: Whenever youre at a loss for what to say to a girl you like, imagine youre a man in bed with three beautiful women. Then say what that man would say. Maxim #15: Female cultural equality = male dating inequality. Female cultural inequality = male dating equality. You cannot have both by the laws of human nature. Maxim #17: Be narcissistic. There is no greater divergence than that between a womans stated disapproval of male narcissism and the rapidity with which she jumps into bed with a male narcissist. Maxim #18: The two fundamental propositions upon which all game theory rests are male choosiness and female abundance. All alpha males have these two mindsets in common. Corollary to Maxim #18: Male choosiness and female abundance do not necessarily have to be true for the strategy of behaving as if they are true to be effective at seducing women. Maxim #19: The alpha male thinks and acts more like a woman than a man in matters of seduction. He understands his adversarys psychology, and uses it to shatter her defences. Maxim #19: Making a woman feel a little emotional pain will reward you a thousandfold in returned physical pleasure. Maxim #19: Never take a womans word; a womans actions are the best interpreters of her thought. Maxim #20: Do not ever reveal the details of your finances to a girlfriend or wife. Avoid getting joint accounts. As a man, you must draw a line in the sand separating money from love. If she balks, dump her. Maxim #20: The meaner a girl is with you, the likelier she wants to fuck you. Corollary to maxim #20: The nicer a girl is with you, the likelier she thinks youd make a great eunuch friend. Maxim #20: All types of game are basically variations in the balance of beta male and alpha male traits. Maxim #20: First lead by defying. Then lead by inspiring. Finally lead by desiring. Maxim #20: The gina tingle is the principal moral code to which women subscribe. All other moral considerations pale in comparison. Maxim #21: Betas pay, alphas split, super alphas profit. Maxim #21: Never talk about getting into a relationship even if the girl says thats what shes looking for. Maxim #22: A woman with inflated self-esteem is a woman who will erroneously believe she is too good to date men normally in her league, unless steps are taken to bring her self-esteem back in line with reality. Corollary to Maxim #22: A dating market lopsided with unrealistically high self-esteem women will shrink the pool of men available to date and marry, with the consequence that women remain single longer than they would otherwise. Corollary to the corollary to Maxim #22: The most effective measure society can undertake to increase the incidence of marriage and the quality of married life is to stop artificially propping up womens self-esteems. Maxim #23: Limited options = looser standards. Maxim #23: The defensive crouch is where pussy tingles are born Maxim #25: Withholding sex is the tactic of a woman who has already lost. It is mutually assured destruction. Maxim #26: Women secretly hope that you wont rob them of the opportunity to make themselves vulnerable before your alpha inscrutability. Maxim #26: If a woman says the word sex in conversation with you or about you, no matter the context, it means shes thinking about having sex with you. Maxim #27: Women are more pliable in the company of competing women Maxim #27: You have to make marriage an attractive alternative for MEN  not women  if you want the institution to thrive. Maxim #27: Beyond beauty, a womans attractiveness to men is partly a function of her feminine vulnerability, or her ability to mimic feminine vulnerability. Corollary to Maxim #27: Men are turned off by overconfident, assertive, proudly self-sufficient women. Maxim #29: Think of female egos and female vaginas as opposing forces. The more one is stroked, the less the other wants to be stroked. Maxim #29: Once a girl knows she can get sexless intimacy from you, she will curse you with that for as long as you allow it to happen. Maxim #30: A girl will always make time in her faux busy schedule for a man she likes, and when she cant shell be the one to suggest another time. Maxim #30: Men can leverage their commitment far longer than women can leverage their sex. Maxim #30: Ignore a womans flaws at your peril. They are the key to reconfiguring your perception, and thus her attainability. Maxim #30: When in doubt, ask yourself WWJD? What Would a Jerkboy Do? Then do that. Maxim #31: Any change in the relative status between men and women introduces new instabilities into the mating market. Maxim #31: The faster a woman falls into bed, the faster shell fall into another bed. Maxim #33: NO girl wants to be thought she isnt a special little snowflake. Maxim #39: A womans standards are like a house of cards: kick out one from the bottom and the whole edifice crashes down. Maxim #39: If you want a wife stay clear of investing much in girls who constantly remind you they like to have fun fun fun and get bored easily. Maxim #39: Stop smiling so much! Girls will think youre ingratiating. Girls prefer men they can ingratiate themselves to. Maxim #40: Men are strictly monogamous only insofar as their options for sexual variety are limited. Maxim #41: A girl who mentions rape or suicide during the first few months of dating in any context other than as a third party making a wryly humorous observation immediately outs herself as a crank with borderline personality disorder who will be a living nightmare as a girlfriend. Maxim #41: Its never innocent fun. Maxim #41: The more experience you have with women, the more youll know which women have experience with men. Corollary to #41: It is the inexperienced beta male who is most often in the dark about a womans sexual history and liable to be victimized by the cheating slut. Maxim #42: Contrast in how you dress is received better by the group when you are socially proofed. Corollary to Maxim #42: If you peacock, dont wait long to befriend the group. Peacocking should be framed as This is totally normal. The problem is everyone elses weirdness about it. Maxim #42: Xenophobia is good for diversity. Maxim #43: You rely on pickup lines to eventually discard reliance on pickup lines. Maxim #44: Women cant feel impassioned without also feeling a little unease. Maxim #44: Women will not hold it against you for trying to get into their panties on the first night. In fact, they will respect you more for your boldness and willingness to follow your manly desires. Maxim #44: There is a three month lag time between a womans vaginal prerogative and her words. Her heart gets the message long before you do. Maxim #45: Any conversation with a woman that is not explicitly framed by you to maximize your perceived status will lead to her forming a negative perception of your value over time. Maxim #45: If a girl isnt working for your love, shes making you work for hers. Better to be a love owner than a love labourer. Maxim #45: Before sex, no girl you are attracted to is important enough to merit an emotional reaction should the pickup attempt turn bad. Maxim #45: Daddys girls are status whores. You will never measure up to her father. Dont even try. Corollary to Maxim #45: Not trying will turn her on. Be indifferent to her fathers accomplishments. Maxim #48: The feminist loathing of male desire is at the root of all their complaining about men and the dating scene. Feminists, in their hearts, despise the freedom and longevity of male sexuality. And they particularly despise that freedom when lowly beta males attempt to exercise it. Maxim #49: If you have no game, or worse, anti-game, little else will compensate for your unattractiveness. Maxim #49: Romance isnt foreplay. Romance is, at best, seasoning on an established sexual relationship. Corollary to Maxim #49: A premature romantic gesture will have the opposite of its intended effect on a high SMV woman. Untethered romance is a DLV. Maxim #49: Waving a roll of benjamins at a woman will not give her tingles. In fact, it will often do the opposite. Maxim #49: If you plan on cheating and get caught, act like a total dick who did nothing wrong. Your girlfriend will then wonder if its something she did. Maxim #50: The wife of an alpha male will stoically endure the worst humiliations while the wife of a beta male wont tolerate his merest deviation from her impossible expectations. Maxim #50: The prime directive of the alpha male is fornication. Anything which hinders the fulfilment of the prime directive is to be vanquished as a foe or excised from the mind as a cancer. Maxim #51: Commanding women to do your bidding will give you a bigger beta margin of error. Maxim #52: Girls need to test men for their grace under pressure. Maxim #53: Love is when youve been granted a temporary reprieve from wondering if you can do better. Maxim #54: A womans happiness is inversely proportional to efforts to accommodate her demands. Corollary to Maxim #54: The more a womans demands are catered, the more irrational will her future demands become. Maxim #55: The training of the woman distils to this essence: Punish her bad behaviour consistently, reward her good behaviour intermittently. Maxim #55: A man can shoot way out of his league if he acts as if he is the one occupying the higher league. Maxim #55: The degree to which you handicap yourself in an effort to signal high status to women should be commensurate with your game expertise and your confidence level. Maxim #55: Less talking is always sexier than more talking. If you struggle to find something witty to say to a girl, stop trying. Flailing for the right words is approval-seeking beta behaviour that women can sniff from across a room. Corollary to Maxim #55: A grunt or aloof gesture trumps a try-hard, strained, verbose comeback. Maxim #55: If shes hot, why would she bother with online dating? Maxim #56: The more limited a persons options in the sexual market, the laxer his or her mate standards. Maxim #57: Beta males mate guard, alpha males disregard. Maxim #57: Never trust a womans advice on how to please women. Her advice is designed for alpha men she already finds attractive and from whom she seeks signals of attainability and commitment. Corollary to Maxim #57: A womans sex and relationship advice isnt meant to help men; its meant to distract men from what really works to turn women on. Maxim #59: The most successful marriages are those with a balance of power that slightly favours the husbands status over the wifes looks. Maxim #59: The longer you are away from seducing new women, the harder it will be to seduce one when you want. Maxim #59: We tend to defer to looks as a judgment of a mans sexual market value because that is what is most easily observable given situational and time constraints, but a mans looks are only one male attractiveness trait among many that account for his desirability to women. Corollary to Maxim #59: A womans sexual market value is more accurately judged solely by instant appraisal of her looks. Maxim #59: High IQ is no inoculation against beta delusion. If anything, high IQ obstructs clear thinking about womens nature. Maxim #61: Among loves many benefits is its capacity for diminishing to insignificance those differences that would have prevented its flourishing in the first place. Corollary to Maxim #61: Avoid emphasizing any values differences until love, or a mind-blowing orgasm, has taken root. Maxim #65: The accidental alpha trumps the intentional beta. Maxim #66: Half the battle of game is stripping a woman of her inborn self-entitlement complex. Maxim #66: The worst thing to happen to America was womens suffrage. Maxim #66: As men are becoming ever bigger pussies and betas in their dealings with women, they are losing the leverage to shape and push womens child-like and selfishly amoral political opinions in logical, just and long-term oriented directions. Maxim #67: Women regret the cocks unwrapped; men regret the poon untapped. Maxim #67: A man who has stopped seducing new women is a man who is becoming less seductive to his main woman. Maxim #67: When women are confronted by a man with low status behaviour that is incongruent with his high status looks, they will never resolve the incongruity to the benefit of his status; women will always resolve the incongruity to the detriment of his looks. Maxim #68: The definition of Inner Game: Hit on every woman who stimulates your crotch. Make life uncomfortable for them, not yourself. Maxim #70: Civilized, coddled chicks dig jerks. Maxim #70: Any son not explicitly taught about the ways of women by an experienced father will become more beta under the influence of his mother. Corollary to Maxim #70: A society of ascendant female academic, workforce, political and family influence necessarily emasculates its sons and masculinizes its daughters. Maxim #71: In their sexual primes womens attraction for assholes is at its strongest. You can catch a lot of hungry flies with honey, but shit attracts the most well-fed flies. Maxim #71: When a girl signals that she doesnt enjoy blowjobs or sex, do not spend one second more with her. Your libido is too important to gamble on such a girl. Maxim #73: When a girl emphatically insists she is so over you, shes never been more into you. Maxim #75: If you get sexually rejected, dont admit it to yourself, and especially dont admit it to the girl. Maxim #77: Women will screech louder the closer your words get to damaging or exposing vulnerabilities in their sexual market value. Maxim #77: The role of style in diverting attention from male ugliness is severely underplayed by most ugly men. Maxim #80: The more cocks that have ravaged a woman, the less any one cock will mesmerize her. Maxim #81: Whenever you hear or read the words gender, gendered, gendered norm, subtle gender bias, or increasingly egalitarian, yet there remains know that you are dealing with a leftwing equalist, blank-slate believing fruitcake who cannot deal with the fact that men and women are biologically different from birth. Maxim #83: Awareness of a womans games is a precision-guided weapon in a mans arsenal of seduction. Slyly revealing your knowledge of a womans obstructive game tactics is like catnip to her pussy. Maxim #84: Respect the momentum. Maxim #85: As womens bodies age and weaken, their rationalization hamsters grow bigger and stronger. Eventually, the hamster is powerful enough to take control of all higher order consciousness. Maxim #87: The more expensive or thoughtful the gift you give a girl, the greater the risk that she will subconsciously begin to think she is too good for you. Corollary to Maxim #87: If you are dating out of your league, or you are dating a young hot babe in her prime, you should do the exact opposite of what everyone will tell you to do  *dont* buy her expensive gifts. Be particularly wary of advice from women. No woman in the world is capable of thinking clearly or impartially on the matter of acceptable levels of male provisioning. Even old, fat hausfrau hogs will expect mountains of jewels in offerings from men. Maxim #93: The rare older woman-younger man pairing is like a lab experiment gone wrong. It violates the natural order of things, and leaves its practitioners emotionally twisted and in a constant mental race to hyper rationalize their subpar mate choice. Maxim #97: Do not tempt a womans withdrawal with conversational topic overkill. You made a funny, now surprise her with something new. Maxim #98: Marriage is no escape from the sexual market and the possibility that you may be outbid by a competitor with higher value. Corollary to Maxim #98: Singleness is no guarantee of full sexual market participation. Maxim #99: Female coyness is a purity signaller as well as an ego-boosting mechanism designed to reaffirm a womans sexual market value at the expense of lowering the mans sexual market value. Corollary to Maxim #99: Female coyness serves a secondary benefit as an anti-game strategy to make a high value man seem more attainable to a lower value woman, or to offer low value women plausible deniability for failing to attract the interest of high value men. Maxim #100: The urgency and strength of a womans desire for a man is directly proportional to the degree to which he is perceived higher in value than her. Maxim #101: For most women, five minutes of alpha is worth five years of beta. Maxim #101: Compliments breed complacency. Critique breeds conciliation. A woman will never work as hard for a mans approval as when his approval is most elusive. Maxim #101: The sluttier the girl, the more noticeably pregnant shell need to be before she admits to having had sex that counts. Corollary to Maxim #101: Even thenOh, its the way the shirt fits. Maxim #102: For most men, five minutes of a younger, hotter woman beats five years of older, uglier women. Corollary to Maxim #102: A beautiful, slender older woman will be a better lay than a plain, fatter younger woman. Maxim #102: The hottest babes will not be found in prosperous countries, but in countries on the verge of prosperity. The worlds ugliest women will continue to be found in backward primitive societies. Maxim #105: Women, and leftoids, are unhappy when they have no dominant power to whom they can submit. Maxim #105: Frequency and absurdity of female delusions about their romantic worth are directly proportional to real world evidence of their romantic worthlessness. Maxim #105: Pregnant pauses are the players best friend. Maxim #105: Where theres incentive, there are lies. Maxim #109: Consensual polyamory is a contrived hookup service for undesirable sexual market rejects. Maxim #112: Never underestimate the sneaky lengths to which a womans female friends will attempt to undermine her relationship with a boyfriend or husband they dont approve of. Maxim #198: Use of the word disenfranchised or other similar nomenclature of deconstructivist post-modern pablum automatically discredits an argument for serious consideration. Maxim #200: Men acquire lovers; women share lovers. Maxim #200: Chicks dig guys willing to risk an early, gruesome death. Expendability is a DHV. Maxim #211: A good working assumption is that any married alpha male with options in the sexual market, no matter how religious or declarative of his love for his wife he is, is fucking a mistress. Maxim #204: Modern marriage is a waiver of liability that relieves wives of the responsibility to remain attractive to their husbands. Corollary to Maxim #204: The modern marriage waiver of liability does not extend to husbands, who must remain optimally attractive to their wives so long as the marriage is intact and the cost of failing in this responsibility is excessive. Maxim #210: If you are using a romantic holiday as a pretext to raise awareness instead of raise erections, you are probably a fat loser. Maxim #214: Most men can get cuter girls than they think. False psychological projection of their own sexual attraction mechanism onto women blinds them to this reality.

141,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Agree &amp; Amplify Theory: Applying True Confidence to Game,62,3m95cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3m95cd/agree_amplify_theory_applying_true_confidence_to/,2015-09-25 07:50:01,"**Summary** This post will examine the nature of True Confidence and its source in 'vulnerability'. Further, it will synthesise vulnerability with the machinations of Agree &amp; Amplify, and discuss other ways vulnerability can improve your Frame/Game. **Preface/Assumed Knowledge** A common trait between alpha males is confidence. As per Models by Mark Manson, this exists as both True Confidence and False Confidence. False confidence, which relies upon diminishing others to achieve confidence, has limited success but quickly becomes old in the face of True Confidence. **Vulnerability and True Confidence** True Confidence, on the other hand, is an extremely attractive trait and is achieved when a person acknowledges and accepts themselves entirely. This is often referred to as IDGAF attitude but could be better articulated as This is who I am and Im comfortable with that. If you dont like it, that does not concern me. This is achieved through setting aside ego and acknowledging vulnerability. Once you achieve this sense of identity and self, holding frame becomes the default setting. *Side note: This does not mean you should ignore self-improvement. In fact, the reverse is true in that, when you can put aside ego and accurately acknowledge your flaws, you are more likely to seek ways to better yourself in these areas.* **Vulnerability in relation to Agree &amp; Amplify** Agree &amp; Amplify is a well recognized solution to shit testing and has been discussed extensively by TRP since the subs inception. However, less has been said on *why* A&amp;A works. The short answer to this question is vulnerability in the Mark Manson sense. A shit test will be instituted when a girl seeks to test your fitness and this will take the form of a rapport break. A girl will ask a question or make a statement, usually diminishing your position (either explicitly or implicitly), and will gauge your reaction. For example, a shit test I recently received at a music festival: *I bet you have a small dick. Of course. Leaves me more space to sneak in drinks.* Note: I later hooked up with this girl. To male logic, agreeing with the shit-test acknowledges a fault and indicates a lack of fitness. This logic forms the basis of the blue pill idea that we should conceal our weakness. The same blue pill reasoning would ask, How is it youve just admitted to having a small dick, and this girl is now more interested? However, to those with red pill awareness it is evident that the true confidence displayed, rather than the content of the conversation, is what generated the attraction. Whether I have a small dick or not is irrelevant. Furthermore, amplification to absurdity was not necessary. *Rather, I have displayed vulnerability in agreeing to a fault, but obvious strength in the fact that Ive accepted it and clearly do not care what her position on the matter is.* **Using vulnerability in Game** For vulnerability to work in earnest, you must truly accept all (or at least the major) aspects of yourself. It cannot be faked. To borrow from the movies, accepting yourself isnt a weekend retreat. Its not a goddamn seminar. For those seeking to reach this state of enlightenment, I would recommend reading Models by Mark Manson, whose concepts have formed the basis of this post. However, once this vulnerability is recognized, your sense of self will be so strong that you no longer need to use categorized responses or methods of approach in order to pull. That HB8 drops a shit test? You dont care, you know who you are and her petty opinions bounce right off. Every aspect of your game will improve due to acceptance of who you are and the resulting lack of investment in others opinions of you. **Lessons Learned** - Agree &amp; Amplify works due to the nature of vulnerability in confidence. - Once you can reach a state of confidence through vulnerability, your frame/game becomes untouchable.

142,vulnerability,TheRedPill,How to Focus Your Innate Confidence,142,3g0n2x,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3g0n2x/how_to_focus_your_innate_confidence/,2015-08-07 02:01:13,"*Summary: Confidence is not a ""special"" state of being. For the self-respecting man, confidence is the DEFAULT state of being. Let's talk about all the ways we can channel &amp; focus the innate confidence that flows through all self-respecting men. Let's talk about how to become relaxed and comfortable.* --- #How to Focus your Innate Confidence **The ""Alpha"" of any situation is always the person who is the most relaxed and comfortable:** The person who *needs the other people the least.* The person who is the MOST skilled at focusing their innate confidence. To become the ""Alpha"" of any situation, you only need to ask yourself one question: **How can I become the most relaxed and comfortable person in this situation?** Obviously the biggest thing you can do is to lift. If you're comfortable in your own skin, you are already probably the most comfortable person in any situation, because most people don't excercise and thus don't feel comfortable in their own skin. Another thing is breathing. Try the [478 technique](URL I use it to go to sleep every night, it works like a fucking charm. I also use it any time I want to be extra relaxed and comfortable (about four or five times a day). You always wanna wear comfortable, well-fitting clothes. I don't care too much about how my clothes look, because that does not really help me feel comfortable and relaxed. I only care about how my clothes FEEL on my body. I also hate wearing excess layers, I pretty much wanna be as close to naked as possible at all times. I enjoy the sensations of wind &amp; sun. (I've found its always the Betas who ""layer up"" with a shirt + flannel + jacket. It's like they live in a little protective shell of hipster clothing. Personally, I don't require any protective shell.) You always want to be mindful of your body language. Try to bare your chest 100% of the time. Never put your arms in front of your chest. If you are wondering what to do with your arms, simply cross them behind you in a military-esque pose. This will keep you totally relaxed and other people will subconsciously become aware that you are comfortable/relaxed enough to bare your chest without a second thought (thus being physically vulnerable to attack). In this way, vulnerability can be alpha as fuck. Baring your chest is the simplest and subtlest way to non-verbally communicate the fact that you are confident you can handle any attack. You always want to stretch. If you feel limber and flexible, you feel comfortable. If you feel tight and stiff, you don't. You always want to speak from your balls. Most people make the erroneous assumption that the brain and the body are separate things. Thus, when they speak, they are speaking from the perspective of their BRAINS, and they completely neglect to give their testicles what their testicles crave. You know better: *the mind and the body are one and the same.* Don't pretend they're not. Speak from the perspective of your balls. You always want to allow yourself to be REactive at times. Being proactive with your career and shit is good, but being reactive within social situations (at certain times) is also essential. In any interaction, there will be one person who is spending more energy than the other. You want to be the guy who is spending the LEAST amount of energy. An ""amused mastery"" attitude creates a vacuum of energy because it's a REACTIVE state, and nature abhors a vacuum... When you adopt ""amused mastery"" and start REACTING instead of being 100% proactive, people instinctively fill the energy void that your behavior creates, and they start *proactively seeking your approval.* A big part of being relaxed is knowing your environment. If you are the guy who simply *knows the most people* in the environment you're in, you often find that you're the Alpha (aka ""the most relaxed guy in the situation"") without even trying. The best advice here is simple: ""Open all."" Instead of approaching and opening JUST the women you wanna fuck, approach and open EVERYONE, and then let the women FRANTICALLY TRY TO FIGURE OUT which of them you want to fuck. By opening everyone, you make yourself a complete mystery, because people instinctively assume a few things: * you have higher social proof than them, and are thus more valuable than they are * your agenda is simply HAVING FUN, and you are really good at it. --- **Lessons learned**: * Alpha means being confident, and being confident means being *relaxed and comfortable*. * Lifting is the best way to be relaxed and comfortable. * There are also many ways to be relaxed and comfortable that go beyond lifting. What methods do you guys use to feel relaxed and comfortable? "

144,vulnerability,TheRedPill,"FR - My story - She is not who you think she is, 15 years to find this out (the hard way)",1623,3bn9s6,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3bn9s6/fr_my_story_she_is_not_who_you_think_she_is_15/,2015-07-01 02:15:48,"**Summary** This is not so much a field report but rather my own account of my unplugging, it will cover a time span of over 15 years so a little long. I think its important to create context so the first part is really dedicated to the story behind our meeting and marriage, the second part is the events leading up to the divorce. The experiences I have gone through have fundamentally rewired my psychology and how I see relationships and the opposite sex. Having read this sub daily, I think it is high time to give a little back to the community that crystalised what I already knew to be true. **Part 1  The ultimate Beta provider** I met my ex-wife when I was 24 years old and she was 18, we both worked part time at a store in the capital city of an African country (one of the more developed ones). We were friends at first, I thought she was innocent and sweet, a little awkward but cute. Her father had passed away when she was 8, her mother was a teacher and ruled the house with an iron fist, very conservative and everyone pulled their weight in the household. I respected her mom, she was dealt a tough hand and made the best of a bad situation. I felt that a girl who had been brought up in that environment was bound to be good enough for me. Our paths diverted when I finished my studies and started working full time, she remained working at the stationary store, struggling to help her mom pay the billsvery little future prospects, stuck in a rut. 2 years later, we bump into each other at a bar, we exchange phone numbers and started dating. She dropped her current boyfriend almost immediately to be with me. She was ambitious and wanted to continue studying, she had taken a 1 year break after high school to figure out what she wanted to do with her life. Financially strapped, she could not easily afford tertiary study. She had saved some money for her studies but nowhere near enough. She managed to secure a bursary/scholarship to one of the top universities (she was a smart girl) who paid for 50% of her studies. At this point, deep in a relationship with her and wanting her to be happy, I paid for the rest. (mistake 1) 2 years later. The political situation in our country had gone south and we make the decision to leave for the UK. I would go first and get settled, she would complete her last year of study and then move to the UK. Just prior to her moving, we got marrieda spousal Visa was the only way to get her into Europe (mistake 2). I knew she loved me and I so deeply loved her, her innocence, her frailty, her vulnerability. After she moved to the UK, she decided to change her career direction, she wanted to be a Software Engineer like I was but did not know where to start. We found a college that offered a 1 year Software Engineer qualification, she studied for a year, I paid for her studies and she lived with me rent free. She was my wife, my duty as her husband was to help her be successful so that one day, we could build a strong family unit and not struggle financially (mistake 3) After a while the sex dropped off, I thought this was natural after being together for so long. We had sex once a month if that. I tried talking to her about it, it would be OK for a week or two and then we were back to where we started. I swallowed itshe was my wife, I loved her and our relationship was beyond sex (Mistake 4). One day, after being sexless for approximately two months and missing the affection I so longed for, I found an e-receipt on my home computer from an online store for 3 dildos and some anal lube, they had been ordered several weeks back. I felt betrayed; she would rather have sex with plastic than with me? her loving husband that had given her everything. I went into our bedroom and found them hidden at the back of her sock draw. I did not have problem with her getting dildos, I just felt excludedthis was something we could have done together, she could have been open with me. She said she was going to surprise me and spice up our sex. We fought for a couple of days about this, but it passedI loved her, I believed herbut I also realised, she was not attracted to me anymore (mistake 5). After she finished her Software Engineering studies, I pulled some strings and got her a job as a junior developer working for the same company I worked for but in a different division. We had always had a joint bank account, the account where my salary had been going to, she had her own card for this account and I was finally happy that I was not going to be the only financial contributor to that account. 3 months after starting work she said she wanted her salary to go into a separate account and she would transfer her share into the joint account monthly.RED FLAGS suddenly started flying everywhere. I made it clear that I had been covering her ass for the last 4 or 5 years, there is 1 joint family account and her fucking salary would be going into the family account. Just like I was happy to do when she was contributing nothing. Her salary went into this account, but she opened a separate account where 200 would be transferred monthly to her.at this point, I am starting to feel fucked overbut I am her husband, we are a family, she loves me and I love hernothing is going to break that.right? 2 years later, our bedroom still deadwe agree to have kids, our first son arrived in 2006. We decide to leave London to have a fresh start, I manage to secure a good position with a company in Germany, we sold our home in London (which I paid for) and moveda new life in Germany. In Germany, she stayed at home bringing up the kids, our second son arrived in 2008, we built a huge family home in an exclusive area in the town we stayed in. When the kids were old enoughshe went back to work. I was happy, there was no sex but that was not important. We had a beautiful home, 2 smart kids, a great circle of friends, we were both working and had secure futures. Life was perfectexcept, I knew she found me repulsive. **Part 2  The downfall (Chad enters stage left)** She had been working for about 6 months. The year prior, she had dieted and lost substantial weight. She started looking after herself and I was happy for her, I complimented her every day, tickled and teased hershe laughed. I had always done regular exercise, while I was not ripped, I was by no means fat. One morning, after getting the kids ready and sitting them down for breakfast, I went upstairs to the bathroomshe was doing her face, I came up behind her, hugged her and whispered in her ear you are looking so good, I cant wait to get home tonight so we can have some alone time. She said, Perhaps if you werent so fat I would fuck you. I said.nothingshocked, I went downstairs, packed the kids in the car and drove them to kindergarten. For the first time...I started thinking about divorce. After all that we had been through, all our shared experiences..she blurted out such a hurtful thing so easily. A month later, she did some online training for a week where a bunch of students sit in a virtual class room. A couple of days in, she tells me it is really cool, and one of the other students (Dave) is a really funny guyI would love him if I ever met him. I think nothing of it. That weekend, while on our Tablet at home, she had left her email account open. I noticed 20 emails between her and Dave. I click on the first one, the email history attached belowthey are flirting. I confront her, she says they are just friends and he is in the UK...no danger. I tell her its not OK to be married and flirting with other guysthink of everything we have built up, the kids, the houseme. She cries and says it will stop. I dont trust her. I hack all her accounts and have access to her phone. She sends him an email the next day saying she loved her husband and they need to stop. He agrees. Two days later, she initiates contact again with him and it escalated quickly, I see the email exchanges but let it develop, perhaps she will do the right thing. At dinner, I ask her if she has spoken to him againshe says no, thats all history. Five days later, its escalatedhe is sending cock shots, she is sending vag shots to him via email. I again ask her if she has spoken to him. She says no, with an absolutely straight face but unable to look me in the eyes (well what do you know, my little angel is a really good lier). I tell her I think she is lying and ask her to show me her phoneshe refuses. Then, admits it. She cries, she knows it was wrongwe agree to try again. Its only online right...think of the family, think of the house, the kidsour life together, our history. I mean I was there to help her bury her mom when she passed,her pillar of supportdidnt that mean anything to her? She sends him an email saying they have to stophe agrees. Another 3 days pass, she initiates contact with him again, she is talking about how beautiful his cock is and she cant wait to lick the cum off of it. Turns out my little princess is a raging whore that wants all her holes filled. Dave was good, he knew exactly what to say to get her wetI read it all, each message kills me a little inside. I say nothingperhaps she will figure out that this is wrong and come back to me. After 2 days of intense emails between the two, explaining how they plan to fuck each otherI have got to the point where I realise that I do not know this woman at all. That night, I have said nothingshe is lying in bed next to me with her laptop. I pretend to be sleeping.she cant see my eyes, I have a pillow over my head. I can see her screen. I pretend to be asleep, deep breathing...she opens her email account and starts typing...after 5 minutes I say How is Dave?she slams the laptop shut, she denies it...I ask her to show meshe refuses, then admits it. I blow my topWHAT THE FUCK IS SHE THINKING! She is going to risk this family for an internet fling with some prick in the UK?! The house, the kids, our friends circleeverything we have built up!!? She says she cant help it.she needs this adventure. I tell her she has to make a decision..its me or Dave. She leaves and goes for a walkcrying. I go to bed; she comes home and sleeps in the other bedroom. The next day, she sends Dave an email saying that she has to choose between her husband or himand she chooses him. I was at work when I read thisit took a minute to sink in, I went to the bathroom, holding back tears, violently started vomiting, then passed outI dont know how long I was out for. I left work dazed and confused, went home and slept She got home, asked if I was OKsaid I was fine, shaking, pale, dehydratedI had not eaten in days. We started talking and I asked her if she had reached a decision? She said she wanted to stay and hold family together (the lying whore)I pretended to be oblivious; she then suggested an open relationship. I told her to fuck off, I had self respect, if this is what she wanted then it was not overshe still wanted to fuck him. I knew it was over between usif it was not Dave, it was only a matter of time before she was fucking someone else, I was starting to unplug. The next day, I told her she had a divorce on her hands, the switch had gone off in my head. Having read the exchanges between her and DaveI did not know this cunt at all and she was unpredictable. Everything I did now was focused on protecting myself and my kids. I immediately removed her from my bank account, contacted a lawyer and minimised all communication with her. I took some extended holiday from work, I was not able to function. My concentration was shot. My day consisted of waking up, doing 200 pushups and 100 situps. I ran 10km every morning and 10kms in the afternoon. I would do push ups at every opportunity I had. At night, I would go out with a friend and we would hit all the bars in town. I needed distraction, I had serious IDGAF and for some reason (we all know this).woman flocked to me. Over the next 8 weeks I would end up texting with about 12 different woman, they could not get enough. I was a 40 year old man at the time, on one of the first nights out I met 24 year HB9 hairdresser who could not keep her hands off me. Being out of the game for so long, I did not closeand in realityI did not want to close. But it gave me hope for the futurethis new life might not be all bad. My soon to be ex wife saw this transformation and hated it, now that I had grown a set of nuts and took control of my own life, she detested it. Her Beta provider was disappearing (and somehow becoming attractive again) I was still tapped into her accounts, she was making concrete plans to go fuck Dave in a hotel in London now that she was getting divorced, she had a free pass to fuck Dave. They were sending hundreds of messages to each other every day, describing what they were going to be doing to each other, things you would not want done to a farm animalmy little princess that I looked after like brittle porcelain was going to be A2Ming Davenice. A close friend who I shared everything with told me to stop reading these messages, it was killing me. I said no, I needed to read this because they were cauterising the last set of feelings I had for this woman. I would stop, but only after I was done with the last step. She told me she was going to London to visit her brotherI knew better. I told her I was not stupid and knew that she was planning this, she denied it. I knew what time they were meeting, what hotel they were staying at, I knew the room number, I knew that she had an appointment to have her Vag waxed the day prior to meeting him. Her cousin in London was to lie and say she was with her in case I called. I suspected she wanted to attempt a rescue after she came back from London. Little did she know. We had a house together and this was on the market, it would take another 3 months before house got sold. She wanted me to move outI told her to go fuck herself. She created this situation, she should move out. She wanted to sleep in the main bedroom...it was her room. I told her to go fuck herselfI paid for everything and she should move to the guest bedroom. Her car broke down, she called meI told her to go fuck herself and call Dave. I had given her so much in the past and it would be a cold day in hell before she squeezed anything else from me. For the sake of the kids at home, we were cordial with each other, parental duties continued as they were. We tried to keep life for the kids normal. We made arrangements to have house sold, agreed to divide up furniture and liquid assetsI just wanted out. Her trip to London was in about 6 weeks, during those 6 weeks, I was on an emotional roller coaster. My life consisted of running, pushups, situps, bars at night and meeting new people. I was content with my future one hour, the next hour I was curled up on my bed crying. During a low period I contemplated suicide, I came close, but how would my kids live knowing their father committed suicide...I stepped back from the ledge She left for London, when she left, I told her not to fuck him with a smile on my face. She smiled and said that I was crazy and she was not meeting him. She continued denying it as she had done for the last few weeks. The night they met in London, I gave it a couple of hours then I called up the Hotel, I asked to be put to through to Mr Dave Thundercocks room. He answered.I said Hi Dave, do me a favour, can I speak to Mrs All_fixed_now?, he said sure, who should I say is calling?I waited 3 seconds then said her husbandhe hung up. I then called her mobile, she answeredall_fixed_now, why are you doing this, just leave me for tonight?, I coldly said just so you know that I m not as stupid as you currently look. I heard room 743 is really nice and I bet it has not seen as much action as it is seeing tonight. The only thing I want you to know is that you have lied to me for 15 years about who you really arenow, I know exactly who you are.I hung up. I was done and I felt nothing anymore. I was not angry, depressed, happy or sadI was just empty. My close friend suggested I talk to someone to deal with the pain, I felt no painnothing. I remember talking to him saying that it felt like my psychology had been rewired over the last 8 weeks. My opinion of marriage, being a provider, the true nature of woman, what I would compromise for a woman and what I would not had completely flipped. I would never get married again, I would maintain my independence and I realised that woman arent these fragile little creatures that need to be looked after, it is in their best interests for you to believe thatbut they are experts at deception. She came back from London, as expected...there were tears, begged me to take her back. She tried to come onto me, get touching and affection. I pushed her back. I sat there coldly while she bawled, told me she loved me, for the sake of the kids, the house, our family, all the history we had togethershe was distraught and so desperately wanted me back, my emotions felt tickledonly slightly. I sat back in my chair, looked at her coldly and then said So Daves cock did not taste that good then did it?...got upand walked off. I was done. **UPDATE - The Epilogue** Many of you have asked for an epilogue, how things turned out. While my original post was quite long, I will add a few more paragraphs to close off the loose ends. This all happened during the last quarter of 2011, from when I first discovered the flirting in October, to when she came back from London in November and to when I met my next LTR (a different post) in December. The house was sold in December 2011 but I only moved in February 2012 so we had a couple of more months living together in the house.I was not moving out. After she came back from London, she made several attempts to fix things with me. She went from being nice, she tried appealing to my emotions, talking about the kids, she even tried climbing into my bed naked in the middle of the night. She was in emotional turmoil but I was so thoroughly disgusted by the person I now knew she was that I coldly and calmly rejected all of her advances. This usually resulted in anger from her, I walked awaydid not care, I felt nothing. One night after her usual attempts and anger, she said that Dave was the best fuck she ever had.he made her cum 6 times that night, my response good for you. After the veil of love had been lifted from her, the beauty I had seen in her disappeared. I saw her for the aesthetic wretch that she was, a HB5a 6 on a good day. I was repulsed by her, even though I had never come across the RedPill at this point, I knew something had changed in me, something fundamental. My life was now open ended, I could do anything I wanted and had no commitments to her, the only thing I needed to worry about was myself and my kids. After 15 years of being the sole breadwinnerit was liberating. The one thing I knew was that I did not want any more kids, I would likely be running around like a dog with two dicks and wanted to make sure that I was in control of choosing to have kids or not. I had a vasectomy in December and it was the best decision I ever made (and you will know why in my next post). I realized that despite me having no feelings for this woman, she was still the mother of my kids and she needed to be OK for my kids. After all that she had done to me, I was fair to her and made sure she was OK to find her own place, get moved in and there was minimal impact to my kidsthats the only thing that mattered. In December 2011, I was juggling multiple women, I was out every night with friends or dates and I was looking for an apartment in the old town of my city. I scheduled a viewing to see an apartment I was interested in, waiting at the dooran attractive real estate agent comes up to me and introduces herself. She was 33 years old and extremely attractive, slim, dressed well and had beautiful blue eyes. We go inside and she starts showing me around, she asks why I am looking for an apartment, I let her know its a divorceshe starts telling me about her divorce. We spent 3 minutes looking at the apartment and the next hour talking about our failed relationships. She was open and honest, a breath of desperately needed fresh air. She was to be my next LTR. I heard through the grapevine that my ex-wife went off the rails for a few months. On the weekends that the kids were with me, she would apparently go out with friends and fuck anything that moved. Apparently she even had a couple of Lesbian encounters. Over the next 3 months, she introduced 2 men to the kids, guys that stuck around for a couple of weeks. After the second one disappeared off the scene, I told her to settle the fuck down and find a new man and stick with it. I did not want a revolving door of men coming and going out of my kids life, if the kids were introduced to one more man that was only there for a couple of weeksshe would find herself in court and I would look for custody. 6 months later, the ex-wife met another guy and she has been with him ever since. Tall, balding on top with a pony tail, skinny but with a fat stomach, only drinks Sodas and Red Bull, absolutely no dress sense. My friends have told me she downgradedas long as she is happy I don't care. He is BB through and through and a nice guy, he is good to my kids and teaches them right from wrong, he is not a negative influence on them. They stick around for a coffee when they pick-up or drop-off the kids, we do birthday partys together and there is no anger. My ex-wife continues to be extremely nice to me, she tries to help and make my life easier, I put it down to her guilt nerve still twinging in the back of her neck. Oh...and she has put all the weight back on. I am in the best shape of my life (thanks to TRP's lifting advice) **Lessons Learned:**  You think you know your little snowflake? You dont know her at all. If you think she is a snowflake, its because thats what she wants you to believe. It serves her purpose  Don't be a Beta provider  Does not matter how lost she feels, does not matter how much your caretaker instinct tells you to help. She will not appreciate it in the future, the only thing she appreciates is what happens now (Brifaults law).  Dont be a begging Beta, if she does not want to have sex with you then dont beg, you cant negotiate this shit. Be the guy she wants to fuck, and if its not herthen its another one of the lined up woman. My current response to a dead bedroom shit test is You dont control my sex life, you either keep me happy or I get someone else to keep me happy  If she cheats - the only thing that can be rescued is your self respect, GTFO and show no emotion  Some people on this forum say ""dont get married"", I would take it a step further and say dont ever get yourself into LTR situation with a woman where you cant walk away at the drop of a hat. Maintain independence, have no dependents. **Edit 1** Geezuz guys!!! my first serious post and you guys give me nearly 1000 upvotes and you toss fucking gold at me?! **Edit 2** By popular request, I have closed off my story with a small Epilogue.

145,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Study - Disgust dampens women's sexual arousal more than fear,7,3cpr2t,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3cpr2t/study_disgust_dampens_womens_sexual_arousal_more/,2015-07-10 06:06:23,"URL *This is self explanatory. Copied below* *Being disgusted is a bigger passion killer for women than fear, according to new research. The University of Portsmouth study is the first to compare how sexually aroused women are after being exposed to disgust and other kinds of negative stimuli. It is also the first to use medical equipment, in addition to self-reporting, to gauge sexual arousal after exposure to disgust. Dr Diana Fleischman, of the University of Portsmouth's Department of Psychology, carried out the research when she was working at a North American university. She found that the more disgusted a woman was, the less sexually aroused she was likely to be. Disgust is thought to be a protective emotion because it encourages humans to shun anything which could transmit disease, such as another person's blood or body fluids. Dr Fleischman, an evolutionary psychologist, said: ""Sex includes increased contact with body odours and fluids which, in other contexts, strongly suggest disease and would elicit disgust. Women are more vulnerable to contracting diseases through sex than men and show worse outcomes once infected so we should expect that women will be especially turned off when they are disgusted. ""It makes sense that sexual arousal and disgust would affect one another. Sexual arousal motivates us toward closeness with others and their bodies while disgust motivates us away. Given these competing motivations, every one of our ancestors had to overcome disgust in order to have sexual contact and reproduce. ""Another prediction we made was that arousal would reduce disgust sensitivity. Previous studies have found that men and women who are exposed to sexually explicit images report less disgust. However our study is the first to measure blood flow to the genitals, which is necessary for sexual arousal, and how it interacts with disgust."" One of the most consistent differences science has found between men and women is that men are less sensitive to disgust than women, especially when it comes to sex. The researchers wanted to find out if women who are less likely to be disgusted would respond like men when sexually aroused. The research found that women who are not very disgust-sensitive turn down their disgust sensitivity even further when they're sexually aroused whereas women who are highly disgust-sensitive show greater disgust when sexually aroused. Dr Fleischman said: ""When we are deciding whether to have sex there are trade-offs to consider. On the one hand you must have sex to reproduce, and on the other hand sexual encounters are risky for disease transmission. What our results suggest is that the story is more complicated for women and that women differ in how sexual arousal changes their disgust response."" The study included 76 heterosexual women aged 18-42. One group was shown disgusting images then asked to watch an erotic film. The second group watched an erotic film and were then were shown disgusting images. The third group were shown frightening images then shown an erotic film. The fourth group watched an erotic film and were then shown frightening images. Images used to elicit disgust in the women taking part included diseased or injured humans and human corpses, faeces and people vomiting. The erotic films watched were produced and directed by women and intended to be sexually appealing specifically to women. The images designed to elicit fear included violent people, dangerous animals, weapons, heights, tornados and fire. Before the experiments, all the women were asked to insert a vaginal photoplethysmograph -- a clear acrylic tampon-shaped device that measures blood flow to the vagina which indicates sexual arousal. They were also asked to report their own degree of arousal, disgust and fear after their tests. Women who were exposed to disgusting images before watching an erotic film were three times less sexually aroused than those who had seen frightening images or those in the control group. There was no significant difference in the degrees of sexual arousal in the other groups. Earlier studies have shown sexually aroused men are much less likely to find things disgusting. The latest study does not find the same straightforward story for women, but that was predictable, Dr Fleischman says, because of women's greater vulnerability to contracting disease through sexual activity."

Easy-to-read and broken down, I'll share the first 10 with you here: --- **IM MAXIM #1:** The tougher the men around her, the softer she is. The softer the men around her, the tougher she is. The toughest woman is the fatherless woman, for the fatherless woman seeks a surrogate by whoring herself. [See here for more.] **IM MAXIM #2:** A woman never wants you to need her, only to want her. The moment your want becomes need  she no longer wants you. **IM MAXIM #3:** Womens love is admiration built upon respect. Women are drawn to men of experience and power. Mans love is respect built upon desire. Men are drawn to women of innocence and vulnerability. When a woman no longer admires, and a man no longer sacrifices, love is lost. It is a delicate balance, for respect is lost when either fails in their capacity. Man sacrifices, woman admires, that is love. **IM MAXIM #4:** Women love children how men love women. **IM MAXIM #5**: The feminine wants a guardian and the masculine wants to guard. The problem is, neither can happen without trust. The sexes have never trusted each other much, but courtesy of feminism, they have never trusted each other less. **IM MAXIM #6:** There is an immutable animosity between the sexes that serves as the conduit for all distrust. This animosity flows from the inability of the sexes to reconcile their fundamentally opposed sexual strategies. For a mans optimal sexual strategy to thrive, the womans must suffer. For a womans optimal sexual strategy to thrive, the mans must suffer. Each sex is determined not to suffer, and so both inflict suffering on the other in a perverse determination not to suffer themselves. This is the battle of the sexes. This is reproductive war. **IM MAXIM #7:** The sexes desire to trust one another, but they wish to actualise their sexual imperatives far more. As such, trust is predicated on the degree of ones control far more than it is any sense of blind loyalty. **IM MAXIM #8:** Women are followers, not leaders. They follow trends, status and power, not a sense of innate loyalty. **IM MAXIM #9:** The average man is ignorant and misled. His mental construct of women is far greater than anything the typical woman aspires to. This is not his fault, his biology deceives him, society lies and so the deck of deception is stacked. Nevertheless, the reality remains. **IM MAXIM #10:** You conflate her beauty with good character. These things are distinct, but mesmerised by beauty, you think they are identical. --- If you want the rest: **URL Enjoy."
147,vulnerability,TheRedPill,What the Open Marriage of M. Sonmore Taught me About Depravity and Feminism.,3,3e1aoq,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3e1aoq/what_the_open_marriage_of_m_sonmore_taught_me/,2015-07-21 14:46:22,"Read the [linked](URL article, and I still cannot get my mind around it. It's the end all, and be all of feminism, the total victory, the light of Man extinguished forever. &gt; As I write this, my children are asleep in their room, Loretta Lynn is on the stereo, and my wife is out on a date with a man named Paulo. Its her second date this week; her fourth this month so far. If it goes like the others, shell come home in the middle of the night, crawl into bed beside me, and tell me all about how she and Paulo had sex. I wont explode with anger or seethe with resentment. Ill tell her its a hot story and Im glad she had fun. Its hot because shes excited, and Im glad because Im a feminist. Being a feminist means no matter what a woman's depraved and outright evil behavior is, it's ok because woman. &gt; Before my wife started sleeping with other men, I certainly considered myself a feminist, but I really only understood it in the abstract. When I quit working to stay at home with the kids, I began to understand it on a whole new level. I am an economically dependent househusband coping with the withering drudgery of child-rearing Complete role-reversal; her, er, *his* Alpha wife is out earning and fucking around while he dotes away on the kiddies and does the dishes. &gt; Still, as a man, I could, if I wanted to, portray what Im doing as work, and thus claim for myself the prestige men traditionally derive from work. Whenever I tell someone I stay home with the kids, they invariably say, Hardest work in the world. They say this because the only way to account for a man at home with the kids is to say what hes doing is hard work. But theres a subtext in the compliment that makes it backhanded: We both know no one ever says it to a woman. Mothers care; fathers provide care. The difference is crucial. Despite my total withdrawal from the economy and the traditional sources of masculine identity, I can still argue I am a provider. I provide care. This is my first confirmed siting of a male hamster. &gt; In this way, my masculine self-image was stretched but not broken. Diaper bag notwithstanding, I was still a Man. It wasnt until my wife mentioned one evening that shed kissed another man and liked it and wanted to do more than kiss next time that I realized how my status as a Man depended on a single fact: that my wife fucked only me. Hamster overload. &gt; For my wife, the choice between honoring our vows and fulfilling her desires was a false choice, another trap. She knew how deep our love was, and knew that her wanting a variety of sexual experiences as we traveled through life together would not diminish or disrupt that love. It took me about six months  many long, intense conversations, and an ocean of red wine  before I knew it, too. &gt; When my wife told me she wanted to open our marriage and take other lovers, she wasnt rejecting me, she was embracing herself. When I understood that, I finally became a feminist. The normal mind recoils at this; clearly her husband was unable to properly deal with the insane demands of his wife, and he went insane himself. &gt; How does it work? We take turns going out. Because we have small children (ages 6 and 3), one of us stays home. (We dont like to use babysitters because it gives us a curfew; wed rather go out unfettered than worry about turning into a pumpkin at midnight.) Going out alone to hooking up with others was an easy transition. It does work both ways and, yes, **I too enjoy sexual carte blanche. I just dont use mine as much as my wife uses hers.** No shit? &gt; How does it feel? It feels great ... mostly. Most of the time, it feels like a mature, responsible way to address our needs and desires within our loving, mutually supportive marriage. This is not in any way a marriage. &gt; There are of course moments of jealousy, resentment, and insecurity. Recently, my wife went on a date and fell asleep at his apartment. I hadnt heard from her since 10 p.m., she still wasnt home at 6 a.m. ... When she finally texted me at 7:30 a.m., relief coursed through me like morphine. She wrote, fuckfuckfuckfuck Im soooooo sorry. Fell asleep. I replied, Just glad youre ok, but next time, no radio silence. Remember: youre not alone. If it turned out I was a friend of a friend of a friend of this creature, I'd dump my friend. At this point, I'm convinced this entire article is a parody. &gt; This has been the great challenge of my open marriage: to draw strength from vulnerability. Doing so requires supreme self-confidence. Only someone as powerfully confident as Mr. Sonmore could let his wife fuck dozens of other men. Got it. &gt; From everywhere comes the message that what Im doing is for weaklings, losers, failures, pussies. The wisdom of crowds. &gt; Im grateful to my wife for pushing us to take this leap, and whatever happens to us in the future I would do it all again. And when she comes home tonight and crawls into bed beside me with a hot story about her date with Paulo, shell do it all again, too. This then is the ultimate goal of Feminism; women can literally do anything they want, judgement free, and come home to a house and a cuddle - and have share their ""hot"" stories of cuckolding their castrated house-husband over a bottle of wine - just like they'd do with one of their girlfriends. And the entire Nation is a no-judgement zone."

Here's the first 10: --- **IM MAXIM #51**  Women are mercenary. They do whatever it takes to win. They will switch sides or outright lie to secure the man they deem their best option. Thats what you are to a woman. An option. **IM MAXIM #52**  Society claims a woman shown your deepest fears will appreciate your true essence. This is a myth, a grandiose lie. The average man naively expects a woman to treasure his vulnerability in much the way he does hers. She cannot. Presented with such a burden, a woman will plan her exit. Your vulnerability will not be tolerated. Such a mans error is conflating his innate attraction to female vulnerability with a reciprocal attitude. There is no reciprocal attraction. Pre-sexual revolution, men knew this acutely. **IM MAXIM #53**  Superficial vulnerability from a position of power is attractive to women, this is what it means to open up. Substantive vulnerability, eg: being insecure, is not. **IM MAXIM #54**  You think sharing your weakness demonstrates trust and love. You believe you can bond over your pain. You believe wrongly. All she sees is the repulsiveness of your weakness. She does not respect your weakness, your pain, or how difficult it was for you to share your pain with her. Women do not care. They can admire your persistence in the face of such, but not your need to express it."" **IM MAXIM #55**  Money is makeup for men. Money on a man looks like makeup on a woman. **IM MAXIM #56**  Money is more important than women. Chase money, not women. You are more likely to get women chasing money than you are to get money chasing women. Without money or godlike genetics, youre playing on hard mode. Money makes everything better, the quality of woman you can get is the epitome of such, not the exception. **IM MAXIM #57**  Men control an interaction by being non-reactive. Women control an interaction by being hyper-emotional. **IM MAXIM #58**  ""Women feed off excess emotion, men tire from it, with the exception of anger indulgence. Woman's emotional nature thus makes her highly histrionic. Corollary: men with cluster B personality disorders are histrionic and thrive on emotion. In this way, they are similar to women. You will see many similarities between women and dark triad men (particularly narcissists) if you look closely enough."" **IM MAXIM #59**  Women thrive on drama, it allows them to weaponise emotion and push an agenda. Starve them of emotion, and they have nothing to fight with. A woman starved of emotion will become desperate to sustain her psychological onslaught. As such, she will attempt to pry it from the dead, exaggerating observations and manufacturing issues in order to sustain the indignance necessary to maintain her psychological assault. **IM MAXIM #60**  Women are psychologically violent. And probably my favourite one: **IM MAXIM #63**  ""Always protect the core of your essence, should you choose to let her in, never let her in completely. See yourself as a castle, let her into the castle, but do not give her the key to the heaviest door. She will notice the door is closed. She will ask you what's behind the door and if ""you can let her in?"" Ignore her protests and manipulations. Never open that door. Not a woman alive other than perhaps your mother is worth opening this door for. If you believe love entails ""sharing everything,"" you don't understand love."" --- If you want the rest: **URL Once again, enjoy!"

The problem is that the tingles and the sympathy are mutually exclusive. You can't have both""* - /u/RU_Crazy ---------------------------------------------- It's not that a woman can't sympathize with you, it's that her tingles override anything else she feels as a protective mechanism (avoid beta insemination if possible). - Love goes down, respect goes up... - **Hierarchy of Love**: Men =&gt; Women =&gt; Children =&gt; Pets **Hierarchy of Respect**: Pets =&gt; Children =&gt; Women =&gt; Men - The architecture of a woman's hierarchy of feelings changes based on her relationship with the organism. Don't confuse this with, [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](URL where a lower level must be satisfied to get to the next. - **Male-Female Relationship** The hierarchy of women's feelings with men is ~~ * 1) Tingles * 2) Sympathy. Note: just in terms of priority, not the whole thing. - When she is with a man, whether he be an orbiter, an acquaintance, her boyfriend, her fianc, or her husband, someone not blood related, there's a sexual dynamic present. Whenever any male-female interaction takes place, a sexual dynamic is present. You are designed to constantly assess the sexual viability of the other, treating them accordingly. That is, just because you've met them before, it doesn't end your instinct to assess the other. - Men have a much lower threshold for sexual viability, and less feelings of disgust towards unattractive women. Whereas women have a much stronger feeling of repulsion towards unattractive men than vice-versa. This makes sense because her [peak SMV years](URL her best window of fertility, is short, and the gestation period of a fetus is very long. That is one whole birth cycle a woman must wait to impregnate herself with Chad's seed. All a man does is bust a nut, a very replaceable resource. A woman's time isn't. No one's time is. Think of it like this... - * **Metaphor** : Not only do [women see men how men see jobs](URL but women see betas how people see dog shit. The turd that lies before you has done nothing to you; you've had no previous quarrel with it, but it is a potential source of disease. As a protective mechanism, your body invokes a feeling of disgust to repel you from such things. The dog turd has done nothing wrong, but you attribute your feeling of disgust towards the turd, and then you resent the fact that it did so, one big [positive feedback loop](URL that continues to grow until you remove yourself from it. It would be more convenient to just step on it instead of walking around, but your disgust overrides that feeling. It would be more convenient for the woman to settle for the beta that stands before her despite his display of weakness, but her repulsion to the very idea of a lesser male impregnating her overrides that. Insemination by a beta when she has better options is rape. **If she does end up sympathizing with you, the tingles disappear. From her perspective, the hierarchy of respect has shifted: pets =&gt; children =&gt; men (you) =&gt; Woman (her). There is nothing for her to look up to, to admire, to respect, a woman's 'love'. For a woman, sexual attraction and sympathy are mutually exclusive.** - * If you accidentally stepped on this turd, you'd be pissed off. All you were trying to do was get to your car; you did nothing wrong and now you have dog shit on your shoes. All a woman was trying to do was impregnate herself with a man she deemed worthy, but then you flashed signs of weakness and made her question herself. She thinks you've been putting dog shit in her pussy all along even though it only happened once because [women perceive the world as a persisting state](URL specifically [here]( URL - That is how a woman feels towards a man who displays a certain lack of fitness. Her repulsion for signs of lacking fitness are stronger than any signs of sympathy present, if at all. **Her sexual strategy is more important to her than you as a human being**. When you display signs of weakness, even if something was out of your control, she can't get over the feeling that it's unattractive to her. She may stick around and is very likely to remain polite and courteous, but the tingles will surely decrease (discussed later) - **Female-Female Relationship (Heterosexual)** - The hierarchy of feelings of a woman with another woman is... * 1) Competition * 2) Team Woman/Sympathy. - Women are herd creatures. By default, women fight for 'Team Woman' despite any wrong doing towards *somebody else*, especially a man. It takes an extreme case to override this. *All hail the female imperative*. You'll notice when women are 'attacked' or 'harassed', other women will respond with something like, *""She's fine just the way she is, stop fat shaming!!! OP, don't listen to those jerks, you're beautiful hun.""* Translation: Only women are allowed to define what is sexy and shouldn't have to put in effort to be attractive. Example: [Protein World Ad Campaign Gets Attacked by Feminists and SJW's](URL for being *""offensive, irresponsible and harmful because it promotes an unhealthy body image* [(Source)](URL - What is Team Woman? It is a temporary alliance, an instinctive herding mentality women adopt **when convenient** for the female gender as a whole or for herself (ie *[""There's no reason to hit a woman""]( URL - Bill Burr Clip). - This may be default, but it is not the feeling of priority. It is overridden when Team Woman is no longer convenient. If a woman feels another woman is much more attractive, monopolizing attention from the local Chads (or just has an unacceptably big market share of attention), gives out access to her pussy easily (drops the price floor of pussy for her), or gets more affection and provisioning than she does from a dating prospect, she couldn't give two shits about her. Spreading rumors to ruin her reputation, name calling, or the social exclusion of the target is likely to ensue. She is disposable. As a matter of fact, it is plausible that women sync their periods with the 'alpha-female' (head of the pecking order) AKA 'menstrual cycle leaders' because ""if I, the most sexually viable female, the one with the 'best' genetics can't get pregnant, no one can."" - **Female-Child/Pet Relationship** - There isn't an hierarchy of feelings for children or pets because there isn't a sexual dynamic present. Both genders usually have no sexual feelings toward pre-pubescent children (usually), they only harbor potential sympathy and protective instincts should something harm them physically or emotionally. - --------------------------- **Baseball** - One act of 'beta', or a demonstration of your lack of fitness won't necessarily end association as [Briffault's Law](URL indicates, **but it will result in a loss of tingles. AWALT**. Think of displaying weakness as baseball. The first strike is, ""eh, it happens."" The second strike, ""i dont know about this... He can't screw up any more."" Strike three ""you're out"". You'll know you striked when she withdraws sex and affection, or starts shit testing more. **She wants you to hit the ball. She wants to think she has not wasted her short SMV window investing time in a 'loser'. She wants to feel like she is good at identifying quality.** If you strike out, you have to wait for the rest of the team (other men available) to bat before you get another turn. - **The problem with connecting 'strike three' with a woman's exit is that there is a delay.** She will discretely sort through her backup guys or be more receptive of guys she runs into, looking to swing branches because her current branch is about to break. Gotta make sure the next branch isn't broken too before you grab it. Optimally a woman would rather hold on to two branches, thus dividing the weight (AF/BB). Whether the tree has inferior genetics that made it more susceptible to snapping or an outside force like a storm or another animal injured it, something completely out of its control, is irrelevant. The branch is about to break, and can no longer be relied upon as a support [cantilever](URL **By the time you have 'the talk', she's already made up her mind well in advance. She has already packed and planned her exit**. Don't beg her to stay or ask what you could have done better. Don't ask why she cheated or flirted with other guys, it doesn't matter. Move on. **She was never yours, it was just your turn. [You were fine before her, you'll be fine after](URL The most effective way to deal with this situation is to withdraw your attention and run dread game by pursuing other girls or none at all if you don't feel like it. Focus on yourself because she sure as hell is doing the same thing. - * **Note**: Many women, including your girlfriend and wife, often gather orbiters for validation and other men as sexual backups should the relationship go south in her eyes. She will tease the beta orbiters just enough to keep them around to provide an ego boost and run errands for her with as little reciprocation as possible. It is not uncommon for a woman to have 'platonic' conversations with Chad on the side as to entertain the idea of hooking up with him though she may not have an intent to pursue him just yet. **Women hate being alone for too long on a level much higher than a man experiences.** ---------------------------- **Feelings, Vulnerability, and Weakness** * Feelings =/= Weakness This is a common misconception. When it is said not to display your feelings, we're talking about complaining and demonstrating that your lack power in your environment. **The only feelings women want to hear are that of passion and ego, a display of extreme interest, confidence, and desire for something, especially success**. If a problem is necessary to state, the difficulty should be downplayed like it's no big deal, and say you've got it covered. The only thing a woman wants to hear is how your frame is unbreakable and you have control over your life, nothing else, even if she asks (shit test). Example: Her: Honey how was your day? You: The boss was a bit rough on us today, but not too difficult. All G. How about you? Her: How was your day? You: I got a promotion! * Vulnerability =/= Weakness Another common misconception. **Vulnerability can be used to increase your value, but only from a position of power. It can only be a compliment to an already sturdy frame and decent level of attractiveness.** Example: If she perceives you as attractive, you can 'confide' to her that you have a 'soft spot' for puppies. Double points if you have a puppy with you, kiss its head, and pet it. She will think you're 'alpha' with a soft side that only she (in her mind) gets to witness. *She* tamed *you*. This is the same phenomenon as 'taming' the 'bad boy'. It's an ego booster. This tactic will not work if she thinks you're 'lesser'. - For more on vulnerability: URL by /u/Rollo-Tomassi ----------------------------------------------- **Final Note** Women are not inherently evil, they're just looking out for number one. *""Nobody is against you, they're for themselves.""* Hypergamy is a biological necessity to keep the species strong, it just sucks when you're on the sharp end of it. Your goal in sexual strategy is not to convince girls to have sex with you, but to **become the kind of man women want**. Women have the ability to drop you so quickly and without remorse because it makes the process of branch swinging, hunting for superior genetics and/or self preservation, much more efficient. **Don't mis-attribute efficiency for malice**. The sexual marketplace is all one big game and it never ends, especially for men. Acceptable moments of weakness are the burden of the man, and the luxury of the woman. She can lean on you, but not the other way around, at least not for very long. You have to recover quickly. **Hard times can strengthen intergender bonds, but don't get used to it or rely on it.** Stay strong my TRP brothers. - --------------------------------------------------- **Related Reading** - [Hypergamy 101 - Women See Men the Way Men See Jobs](URL by /u/Garl_Vinland - [Hypergamy 102 - Her Perception and Context Means Everything](URL by /u/dr_warlock - **Side Note**: I have made 9 more additions to the Red Pill Video Compilation Nuke post, see the edits at the end for the list. edit: Feelings, Vulnerability, and weakness section. edit 2: There's a loser downvoting almost every comment in this post.

Now, I haven't seen this plate for a good six or seven weeks. The prime reason being was that she was getting far too needy and really wanted the LTR upgrade. Despite her good looks and the fact that she takes care of herself, she's way too entitled. She's too good to cook, her Mother still cleans her flat for her weekly and her army of beta orbiters are just way too numerous and involved. They bore me. She had been wanting to meet with me for over two weeks asking me to various functions and shit. But as I've just changed jobs, I really have not had the time. Plus she's too much effort. I have other lower-investment plates. Anyway. During Monday's phone call, she tells me that she was late on her period, took a pregnancy test and it's positive. She claims it's mine. Now, I'll admit a shiver went down my spine. Sort of like an ""Oh fucking fuck"" kind of moment. But I'm a rational man and I'm not about to do this on the phone. I tell her to meet me and we'll discuss it. I met her yesterday. She thought we were going for a nice coffee to discuss our bright future. But I had other plans, a series of quick fire questions in the car park and wouldn't you know it, her bullshit showed cracks. Not immediately, this specimen is definitely one of the smarter hamsters, But like most women, she sucks hard at math. But dear oh dear, the lengths these women go to. ""When did you find out about this?"" I ask, all concerned. ""Oh, a few days ago..."" ""How long are you late by?"" Four weeks. Hmmm, a very succinct and well thought out answer, puts it right in the ballpark, huh. ""So you did a pregnancy test two days ago?"" Yep it was positive. ""That's strange. You mean you weren't freaking the fuck out when you were a week or two late?"" Oh no, I was definitely. But I didn't know then. ""Did you do a test then?"" Oh, no. Does it matter? It's positive. ""Have you seen the doctor?"" Yes, he said I definitely am. ""When did you see the doc?"" Now she gets evasive. She blurts out ""A couple of days ago, look are we going to discuss this or are you going to keep on grilling me?"" Flag right there! I know after my Sister's kid that Doctors don't deal with pregnant women in the UK. They are normally led by the midwife. The response the receptionist would have given her would have been that if the pregnancy test was positive there is no need for a Doc's appointment and secondly to schedule a midwife appointment at 16 weeks. She may be playing the victim card, but I'm playing the ""You're full of shit and we both know it"" card. So far, I was trying to determine if she was pregnant. My initial hunch was that she is not. We finally head in and we get a coffee. She's surprised when she has to pay for herself. Hey, you're going to try and play me, no way I'm going to pony up the dough for a grande latte with whatever else shotted in there. We carry on talking. I just said, ""It must have been after XYZ Event in that case."" I wanted her to think she had won. ""Yep, must have been. But then condoms fail 5% of the time or something"". Five per cent? Really? That is fascinating. Who'da thunk we'd be the unlucky 5%. Now I'm a careful chap. I learned condom use and disposal early in life and I've never so much as had an even slightly off experience with them. I know my brand and know my lube. ""Who else knows, then?"" I ask. She evades the question again and says she wanted to see how I would react. We get to the question of abortion. She says it's off the menu - convenient. She said it loud enough too for a few nearby people to hear. Crafty bitch. I of course play the respectable moral man. I just say, ""Well, of course, if it's mine I'll happily raise it and support it."" A gleam goes across her eyes at such words. Yet the fact she paid for her own coffee must have been playing heavy. ""Do you earn enough to support all three of us?"" she asks. ""Oh yes my dear. But, I do have to ask, do you earn enough to support yourself after your maternity leave?"" A slightly confused look on her face, she asks ""Well, I can't go to work straight away, I'll need time off at the beginning and help with that... "" A lot of talking in other words. ""Well, my lunch hour is up sadly. I'll call you later tonight!"". I cut things off because she was getting louder and more hysterical. I wasn't going to win this one with logic. OK, so now I'm worried. Am I going to get saddled with a kid that I really don't think is mine? Is she even pregnant. Annoyingly, at the extreme ends, the timelines mentioned are plausible. But I can't help but notice that all of this coincides with my recent new job and significant pay raise. A subject which I told nobody except for family who then congratted me over social media. Fucking idiots, I told them not to! I don't like being that public. But anyway. This problem at hand. Hmmmm.... This girl is needy. She posts a lot of instagram and facebook pictures. Bingo. Load up Facebook app on phone, ""How about Chad as a name if it's a boy?"" I write on her wall. (Thanks TRP!) Five minutes later, her Sister has chimed in with ""What the hell? XXX, do you have some news? Call me now!"" I think I'll just let this one play out a little. May as well spread the word, eh? Fifteen minutes in, things are going sweet. She's had to admit it with an ""Umm, kind of..."" Suddenly congratulatory messages from far and wide, I bet from friends and relations she hasn't seen in decades! Aww, I spy a baby shower! How lovely I think. Oh, wait what? A new message? ""I wanted to wait"" she says, ""until we'd decided what to do!"" ""I thought you were against abortion?"" I ask. A few minutes of XXX is typing, then disappearing. She's obviously having to work overdrive to make this response awesome as hell. ""I am. We will talk later!"" I really wanted to say, ""I just wondered what the weight of public exposure would do for your little ruse..."" I've definitely rattled her cage a little. Let's see what falls out. I got home about 6pm tonight. It's been a long day. But what's this? The facebook post has disappeared? Deleted you say? All comments erased, you say? Fascinating. Oh but there's more... her facebook account is GONE? But.... all her pictures of herself in places that she's been once with her holding a fruity drink... Just all gone? 7pm rolls around. I sent her a couple of texts inviting her to talk. I get a single solitary text back. ""It's not fucking yours, OK?"" I virtual high five the God who invented facebook attention whores. I respond, ""What are you talking about? Who's is it?"" ""&lt;guy's name&gt;"" I ponder... who the hell is &lt;guy's name&gt; again... OOOOH Shit... now I know... And really, I know her story before I even asked. Now, my little red piller. If you've read this far, you know that I'm having fun now. But, the rest of this isn't quite so fun. Not every story here is about sticking it to a stupid woman trying it on. I was enjoying myself up until now, but there's a time things get a little, shall we say, empathetic. Anyway here goes. I go bluepill here. I call her instead of texting back. ""What the fuck?"" I think were my first words out. I was expecting the uneasy silence before she started talking. When she did, she comes across as someone who's had the shit verbally kicked out of her over a prolonged period. She broke up on the phone telling me that after I split with her, one of her beta orbiters... no let me be clear, her PRIMARY fucking beta orbiter and her had a few glasses of wine too many after a meal he cooked for her as a cheer-up effort and, well... one thing led to another, and that one thing was unprotected fucking. The crying down the phone was insurmountable. I have never heard a creature that wretched sounding in my life. I hate to say it, even though hours earlier I could have fired her out of a cannon into the sun for trying to fuck me over, I knew exactly what the problem was with this whole picture. Largely in thanks to TRP. But really, I felt what's the point in finishing the demolition. It's clear I'm off the hook, call it a panic attack, a standard female reaction to a bad situation. ""Now &lt;girl&gt;"", I start saying, ""you need to think long hard and carefully here. &lt;Guy&gt; can barely wipe his arse, he gets walked all over by his work and so-called friends and he is one slimey little shit. You really need to think if this guy is going to be worth his salt as a father to your kid."" More bawling. And the red pill truths just spill out with her guts like she's just been drawn and quartered. ""He's such a pussy. He played the nice guy to me all these years. All he ever really wanted was to fuck me and he just kept around me even when I said I just wanted to be friends and buying me things and all this shit. And then when you split up with me, he just got me drunk knowing I was too fucked up to think straight. I'm so stupid and yada yada"" You get the drift. The bottom line, he's a pussy. She knows it. She keeps avoiding his calls. More to the point, she keeps avoiding this sad little beta's Mother's calls! That's right, it's his Mother who's trying to get her on the phone and is now in charge of ""the situation"". I decided I had to call her on it. ""Why did you try to make me think I was the Father?"" Apparently it was obvious. Next to beta, I was alpha. There were more words in there, like how I'm actually in control of shit, I know where my life is headed and I called her on her bullshit all the time. Then when I finally got sick of her shit and left her alone, she missed me like crazy and even ""saw the error of her ways"". But when I blew her off, she went into meltdown. And that's when Primary Beta took his chance. A bit of a slimy thing to do in my book. But Betas gonna beta! She was all broken up, he cooked her a meal and got some wine, talker her into taking her pants off. Whaddya gonna do. Grim, now I think about it, but hey. She had to admit all these things to her Sister who was mad that nobody knew about the pregnancy in the first place. Her Sister laid down a few harsh words too about her lying to me (good on ya sister!) and even reckoned that Beta will never be Father material either. I finished up with her and said, ""Good luck and I'd seriously reconsider keeping it before his fucking Mother gets involved. You really want her in your life forever more?"" She responded saying that having either Beta or his Mother in the picture everywhere just wasn't an option; she would emigrate if she had to. I get where she's coming from. Beta is 34, has a relatively decent paying job. But he's a thorough Mummy's boy. I wouldn't be surprised if this guy only just lost his virginity in this very scenario. He had a lot to say about me too when he first met me. Anytime I'd call her on her shit, he'd immediately defend her. He was pussy beta, through and through. Anytime me and this ex-plate were done fucking, we would actually sometimes laugh about him, about how he's a lap dog and tales of times where he showed up and played taxi sometimes for hundreds of miles. LOL sad shit. Yep, I guess I'm not quite TRP. I should laugh at her and tell her she's a stupid slut. I should be on Beta's side with Father's rights and all this shit. But really, I would bet my arse that he did play the nice guy and seized his moment of vulnerability. From the texts and things I got after I stopped seeing her, she was definitely missing me hard. Lessons here, sirs and for the ladies watching. - First, Nice Guys really ARE the ones to look out for. Conniving little shits I think is more accurate. Really, an alpha is a far safer bet. - Secondly, given the option between a beta and alpha, a girl will make a play for the alpha every time. You know it, I know it. Wait for it to happen, it'll be far more real. - Third, there is such a thing as being so beta a girl still won't want you anywhere near your own offspring. Even if you can offer financial support. - Fourth, men know your condoms. I play around just like you and I am never too inebriated to make sure the damned thing is on correctly, I am never too desperate to use hers and I sure as shit am not trusting any girl with a birth control pill until she proves she's trustworthy! And even then, there will be spot checks. - Fifth, alpha widows are fucking nuts. They will do dangerous things when pushed. I wouldn't be surprised if this alpha widow is close to throwing herself off a balcony right now. This week has been... enlightening. I just got through typing this. Last text, ""Do you think I should abort it?"" And I'm off to bed. Niiiight! **tl/dr** Girl tries to tell me her kid is hers. It turns out to be her beta orbiter's. Much crying."
152,vulnerability,TheRedPill,"Alex ""The Natural"" is Back",90,34yc5i,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/34yc5i/alex_the_natural_is_back/,2015-05-06 02:02:51,"Those of you who follow RSD will recall the fiasco in Australia after Julian's choke video. At that point, Alex made a decision to leave the RSD fold and started his own gig. His [Youtube page](URL is back, including some of his older videos. Of all the RSD instructor's Alex seemed to best exemplify what Robert Greene describes as ""The Natural"" in his book *The Art of Seduction*... Here's a summary... The Natural is adult male who has maintained childlike qualities that makes him endearing to women. Adults idealize their childhood and long to return to their carefree self. We harbor illusions of childhood as a golden age of freedom and adventure, even for those of us who suffered a great deal of confusion and pain growing up. Children live in a world from which most adults have been forever exiled. Because adult life is full of boredom and compromise, we look for ways to recapture our lost youth and the overpowering feelings of young love. Natural seducers are people who somehow avoided getting certain childish traits drummed out of them by adult experience. Such people can be as powerfully seductive as any child, because it seems uncanny and marvelous that they have preserved such qualities as openness, curiosity, innocence, playfulness, mischief and wonder. Naturals are not literally like children. That would make them obnoxious and pitiful. Rather it is the open spirit, playfulness and vulnerability that they have retained. Out of self-preservation, most adults become rigid and defensive. Defensiveness is deadly in seduction; act defensive and you'll bring out defensiveness in other people. In striving to get ahead in an adult world, most people put up a strong front and hide their vulnerability. They become serious and inhibited. The undefensive Natural isn't restricted by inhibitions and takes pleasure in the moment. He doesn't filter himself, becoming free to be in the moment. He invites his target to temporarily lose inhibitions and join in the fun he creates... Once a target lowers their inhibitions and gives in to pleasure, seduction embraces and consumes them. Naturals appear immune to negativity. Their positive energy and self-amused nature make them the life of the party. Learn to turn any attention to your advantage. Treat all negative feedback as a joke to disarm the target. Naturals appear more genuine and at ease with themselves. They exude confidence and instead of stiffly marching to a conformist beat of the drum, they flow freely and easily and exude a distinctive character. Naturals don't focus as much on tactical process in their method of seduction. They rely on a strong inner game and better instincts. Impish Naturals have a fearlessness that we adults have lost. Imps are brazen, blissfully uncaring. They infect you with their light-hearted spirit. They act as if they do not see the possible consequences of their actionshow some people might be offended, how they might hurt themselves in the process. Naturals have not yet had their natural energy and spirit scolded and shamed out of them by the need to be polite and civil. Secretly, we envy them; we want to be naughty too. Adult imps are seductive because of how different they are from the rest of us. Breaths of fresh air in a cautious world, they go full throttle, as if their impish ways were out of their control, and thus natural.

153,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Of Shit Tests and Men,9,35e7pu,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/35e7pu/of_shit_tests_and_men/,2015-05-10 00:01:58,"Hey all, There's something you need to understand about other men, and shit tests. This post is about interactions with other men and determining between the two of you who's alpha. This is how you can determine who's worth befriending and who's worth nothing (right now). When you talk to girls and they shit test you, they're giving you the opportunity to prove that you just don't give a fuck. Really, that's all that a shit test is: it's an opportunity to prove whether or not you care that you're being confronted. You either accept confrontations as a normal part of life or you react like a fucking beta. So don't. Don't care and respond in a way that you, yourself, can. Be yourself, open up and say whatever the fuck you want (and pass the shit-test). This has a polarizing effect. People will either a.) fucking think you're amazing, hilarious, whatever your prime attribute is or b.) hate your guts so much that they fucking want to fight you. There's no in-between. There SHOULD be no in-between. This isn't just Red Pill advice. This is life advice; if you're vulnerable, you're in power (an advanced concept). A man who's truly confident in his hand will **not** be scared to tip it. This is the ultimate expression of alpha, the ultimate expression of self. You're so confident in yourself, the hand you've been dealt, that you're not scared if everyone sees those fucking cards. Why? Because you're alpha. You're totally, unabashedly the best you can be. Understand that phrase and allow it to truly sink in, because it's exceptionally deep. If you're vulnerable, you're in power. If you're in power, you're alpha. So, that long preface aside, here's how you polarize other men and determine whether or not these people have the same mindset as you. They're alpha, you're alpha, here's how you find your **fucking friends**. You shit-test them. Fuck, right? It sounds terrible looking at the hate that most posts receive regarding shit-testing. ""It's a fucking pain that women try to gauge value and shit-test"", ""Why can't we all be friends?"", etc. You should not think negatively about shit-tests. Shit-tests are the result of social evolution - the idea that our social environment evolves just like anything else. (It does) and shit-tests, acronyms, body language, even the awareness of these concepts - are proof. They're a way that the initiating party (the shit-tester) can determine whether you're at the next stage of social development. It's really just a pass to prove that hey, holy shit, this person isn't scared to live. This person is alpha. This person is the sort of person that moves into adulthood and isn't scared of people confronting them. That's alpha. That's the social prime. When you're in school you learn a lot about getting hurt. School is the only environment that organically develops alongside the submersed individuals. So as you grow, so do the growing pains of emotional development, too. This is a small byproduct of social evolution; we create these chambers of indoctrination that have provenly advanced our scientific capabilities, but also allowed for creative, intellectual, emotional and spiritual advancement as well. So, learning through school so many different things, you come out the other side a certain way. Either the indoctrination broke you and you don't click with everyone else; you never found that sweet spot in the social stratosphere - or you come out the other side understanding so many incredible things about life. The lessons that we learn through school should have given us the opportunity to test small theories in a closed environment and develop, personally, a set of experiences that we could use as a method of back-testing when we want to advance in any way. This goes into our simulated (and simulating) intelligence and the implications of a start and end date to our lives, but that's a philosophical discussion for another time. So you've gotten what I've said so far, right? Finding friends, shit-tests, vulnerability, social evolution. **Conclusion:** So, self-vulnerability is the most prime expression of the alpha. Shit-tests are a way of uncovering an alpha per social evolution, so therefore, finding friends from a shit-test is a way to go. **Application of theory:** Now here's the anecdotal evidence (woo, do you remember where I talked about the personal theory, social advancement, etc.?): I went out last night with three of the most alpha men I've ever met and a beta (sorry if you're reading this, buddy). We all live in the same apartment complex. There's a professional who literally profits off his own creativity, there's an exceptionally competitive athlete who gets paid to coach (1-on-1), there's a guy who has some sincerely unfortunate issues barring him from the manosphere but is on the right path (the beta), and there's me. This is my crew for the night, per penis. Everyone else that joins us are a set of girls I'll skip describing because in their own way, they're all incredibly impressive, too. So there's the setting. A handful of friends and I going out in the city. We find a bar, get cocked, talk to a varying degree of women and shift bars. Two girls come with us. One is the girlfriend of another joiner, and one is a single chick with an amazing gift for conversation. The beta clings on. We get to the new bar and the setting changes slightly. We're heading upstairs and someone bumps into the beta. They knock chests. The other guy shit-tests him with a deadlock stare, figuring out if he's another alpha. The beta agrees and amplifies, fucking tossing the guy back into his friends. This is a totally fucking alpha move (I can explain later). The beta is evolving. The shove gets the whole swarm of idling standers swaying like the tide. It was an impressive shove that was amplified back and forth between them a few times before I pulled the beta away. They both failed the shit-test. How? They fucking kept going. The whole point of a shit-test is to determine whether someone else is on the same level of social evolution as you are. Reminder: You're supposed to use a shit test to determine whether someone is of equal social footing. So... they failed. How could they have succeeded? First off, why the fuck are they confronting each other as they walk by? There's no opportunity for them to be friends. And, in this case, it was clear they were improperly using a shit-test to find an enemy. There's no real purpose to shit-test someone you're walking past. There's no social connection shared between you and you literally have no reason to interact like that. To succeed with a shit-test on another man (sounds weird, I know) you have to be in a social setting. There has to be an introduction and an exchange of credentials (name, occupation, etc.). This shit-testing should only happen at the introduction ( maybe if you're playful it occurs for the duration of the friendship). **Example:** AlphaJohn: ""Hey, I'm John. Nice to meet you."" AlphaGreg: ""I'm Greg."" [Here's the shit-test] AlphaGreg: ""So you fuck dudes or what?"" This is how you find your friends. This is a pretty extreme example but it's a great one. You say something that is controversial on so many levels and you see how the could-be bro reacts. This is polarizing, and you can use it to start good, lasting friendships with men that are on the same level as you. This shit-test can be interpreted as homophobic, which is a huge judge of character. Let's be honest, it's 2015, bigotry is backwards. So I'll put some words in AlphaGreg's mouth that shows that he's a loudmouth and values humor and controversy above all else. So there, use that. AlphaGreg: ""So you fuck dudes or what?"" AlphaJohn: ""Yeah, I'm not sure if you're my type, sugar."" I don't know about you guys, but if I were in the above conversation I'd instantly add AlphaJohn to my crew. Passed with honors, a fellow alpha. Now, AlphaJohn could have also risen past the shit-test in any other Red Pill way. He could have completely shot it down, gone nuclear, whatever - if you're creative, you can definitely figure out a way to apply any one. No matter what, though, AlphaGreg and AlphaJohn reacted in accordance to their own personalities and didn't ""act"", because, let's be frank, being ingenuine friends is a waste of time, so say whatever your personality dictates in the form of a statement that can illicit a binary response and determine if you and this other alpha could be friends. Remember, I'm showing you a success case, but you need to understand that this is a tool used to find out who is NOT your friend as much as it is to find new friends. Eventually, I think society will move past the application of shit-tests but not now. They serve a function, which is to return a value. The value of alpha or beta. A signal. So now you know. You can bypass the shit-test (if you just assume everyone is alpha, which would be fucking nice) but it's a good way of determining investment in someone, and whether or not you're going to have issues down the road (which you can avoid or confront, I just avoid because I'm a pacifist), or just increasing a social bond. Use it as you will, and observe it when you can. Shit-tests perform a social function and this is how we can apply them to find friends. Neat, right? Thanks for reading. @thisisjadaho "
154,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Let yourself get hit.,207,35ow28,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/35ow28/let_yourself_get_hit/,2015-05-12 18:43:07,"In the martial arts world, there is something known as iron stomach. The idea is that someone can train their stomach to withstand powerful blows. Until about a year ago, I thought that it was a myth. I mean, I knew the stomach could be toughened up enough to take a glancing blow (boxers and MMA fighters use medicine balls to do this all the time) but I never thought the idea of hitting someone full force in the gut and them laughing it off was possible. That was when I met a ""guru."" This guy was pretentious, smelly, and annoying. My hopes were not high. He was training with a friend, and offered to heal my sore throat. I was willing to give it a try, because fuck it, but I asked if he needed to touch my throat to heal it. He informed me he needed to jab it. So I told him no. Very kindly, actually. This offended The Guru. He felt an urge to show off his powers. So he invited me to punch him as hard as I could in the stomach. I didn't want to be rude, so I did. And, to my surprise, it felt like punching a brick wall. There was an audible WHAP and everyone turned to look at what the noise was. I was honestly impressed. He seemed disappointed. He asked me to punch again and I said that I was impressed and that I didn't need to. ""Oh,"" he said glumly, ""Most people hurt their hand when they do it."" So, he truly was a douche, and I was truly grateful that I didn't hurt my hand. But what's the point of this? Well, this dude had been through some pretty serious training to get his Iron Stomach. According to him, they started off just tapping his stomach, then hitting it, then moving to fucking hammers. And I believe it. He let himself get hit. Over and over and over again, he stood there and didn't move as people beat the shit out of him. And as much as this guy is an annoying dickhead, I have to respect him for that. And you know what? That's exactly what you and I need to do too. In everything. How do you get good approaching woman? Is it the few successes you have. Yeah, of course. But more than that, it's the million times you get shot down. The first time it stings. You're nervous, so you act like a bumbling idiot. It's like you just got punched in the gut, and now you're on the floor gasping for air. But you get up, and you do it again. Another rejection? Fuck. But you know what, it didn't hurt so bad that time. And you were a lot calmer. You go again and again, until you become a smooth motherfucker, not afraid of the consequences and totally at ease. This is one of the things that separate us from woman. Men need to be hit. We need to fail. We need adversary to get stronger. We need to taste defeat, so that we can be strong enough to taste victory. The thing is, woman may be the LEAST important aspect of this principle. This holds true in business, social skills, art, lifting, everything. But you know what's funny? Once you have been hit enough, woman will come to YOU. Because they will see what kind of man you are. Indestructible. Unbreakable frame. But you can't just FAKE it. They can tell. You need to be shot down. You need to have let yourself be vulnerable and put yourself on the line. Only then can they see your hard earned invulnerability. The book Models has a whole chapter on this, where he argues that showing vulnerability actually shows strength. This is because the fact that you put yourself out there shows bravery and outcome independence. In other words, you are not afraid to get hit. Now I'm not saying tell a woman ANYTHING that she can use against you. But if you like Star Trek, fucking say it if it comes up in conversation. And be damn ready for a shit test from a girl or a guy trying to AMOTG you. But if you hold frame and really don't care, you're gonna come out on top regardless. I've seen it. If you don't let yourself get hit, you're gonna be weak. If you are weak, you will fail. You will blow that chance, because you have no experience. So let yourself get hit. "
155,vulnerability,TheRedPill,On Emotions,0,35ybpy,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/35ybpy/on_emotions/,2015-05-15 01:11:59,"I've been taking in RedPill concepts for quite awhile now and applying them in my daily life and I can safely say it is no longer something I apply but rather who I am. I don't actively think about the concepts, I simply do what I want, go for girls I want, ignore the bullshit people spew, and achieve goals I set for myself. That being said, there was a huge aspect of basic human interaction that I was completely blocking out. I was not allowing myself to FEEL my emotions. I felt that allowing somebody to make me feel was weak and I should never let myself be weak. Forget anger, I learned to embrace anger. I did not learn to embrace anything else. I did not learn to feel sadness, I did not learn to feel scared, I denied myself the truth in my feelings and ignored them. I numbed myself to those feelings because those feelings stem from vulnerability. Red Pill often times speaks of never being vulnerable but I am here to tell you that you will miss out on a large part of the human experience by denying yourself vulnerabilty. It is an extremely important aspect of living life. You need to care for something and let yourself feel your emotions but you should never let your emotions control you. YOU are always in control of what you DO but you can never be in control of what you FEEL without lying to yourself. The RedPill rules and concepts are real, there is no denying that fact; however, I disagree with making yourself a stoic numbed man. When you place yourself in a position of being rejected, you are making yourself vulnerable. When you ask for that raise or promotion your boss may say no and you will have been rejected. You can feel dissappointed. You can feel sad. You cannot let those emotions make you slack or ruin your employment. You can place your trust in a woman as long as you are positive that you are being the best you that you can be. Constantly improve yourself, make her improve to keep you, and let her help you where she can. Yes, she can cheat on you. Yes, she could do terrible terrible things to hurt you. But she could also not, and if you are truly on your game she wont. Now when or if she does screw you over you have the right to feel sad. You have the right to feel angry. You are allowed to feel exactly what you feel and there is no shame in feeling. You are not allowed to wallow in your sadness, or explode in rage, or become a desperate whimpering pussy begging for her back. Feel what you feel, but do what you need to. Allow yourself to be vulnerable. It takes strength to lower the shield and trust somebody else. Anybody can be an untrusting cold man and numb their emotions, be it with alcohol, drugs, or just pure denial. It takes a lot more strength to acknowledge how you feel, identify the source, and work on conquering that fear, or that anger, or the sadness."

Examples include male disposability, the 80-20 rule, and hypergamy. More generally, TRP is a ""safe space"" to approach any issue from a pro-male perspective. This is why the forum here can be interesting almost regardless of what is discussed: the red pill is a refreshing lens through which the world can be viewed without the heavy filter of bitch-morality and anti-male ideology drummed into one's head since one's first day at kindergarten. A component of the social decay that social justice warriors and liberal elites are intentionally or unintentionally wreaking in our civilization is the idea that men and women are biologically the same and that differences in their behavior are results of nurture, not nature. To compensate for these oppressive traditional gender roles, therefore, women should be more masculine and men more feminine. The fact is--simplified but useful--that women are emotional beings that have thrived through navigating society and relationships, while men are designed to operate in relationship to the external world in all its danger and uncertainty. This is why females have higher social intelligence than men and why men are better suited to interact with the tangibles, to conquer and explore and build. Arguably, both elements of the human experience are vital. To further simplify, women are masters and providers of comfort while men are masters and providers of power. Either one without the other is incomplete. For a man to achieve higher levels of completion with respect to developing and settling into his innate male nature, the power he wields over the outside world should involve not only superior physical strength, courage, aggression, and knowledge and familiarity with reality generally, but also the power to maintain frame in situations that would wreak havoc on a female mind. As comfort is threatened, stoicism--or strength of frame--is summoned. Stoicism per se is a powerful philosophy already well-explored by ancient philosophers like Epicurus and Marcus Aurelius and touched on by moderns like Arthur Schopenhauer, but I'd like to take a stab in the dark and apply it directly to modern sexual strategy specifically by calling upon my own experience using stoicism in my interactions with women. **Acting bothered communicates weakness and reduces attraction.** In my current LTR of 5 months I've been a definitive asshole about 4 times. Two of those instances of assholery reduced attraction, and two of them dramatically increased it. The difference between those times that increased attraction and those that didn't is that those that did involved me not caring enough: not texting or calling her back after a considerable period of time and not really thanking her for something sweet she did for me (in this case, a loving letter she hand-wrote for me). Those instances of me being an asshole that immediately decreased attraction involved me caring too much: being offended at something she said, acting hurt or otherwise thrown-off-balance by a comment she made or by her being late to plans we had made (an enormous pet peeve of mine). Avoid / reduce acting bothered. Be a rock and err on the side of not giving a shit. **Being ""excited"" about something demonstrates an undeveloped and outcome-dependent mental state.** As I've grown past my early and mid 20s and now approach my 30s, my general mental maturity has coincided with a specific trend: I no longer get ""excited"" about things. Last month I learned that I will receive a check for $75,000 this year after I sell my share in an LLC I was born into and no longer want. While pleased with this prospect, I would not have described my feelings towards it as ""excited."" When I told my girlfriend about it (note: in hindsight, probably not a good idea), I mentioned it in the same tone of voice and with the same attributed significance as I would while mentioning that I found a cool coupon to a restaurant I like. This stoic behavior communicates strength. pre-existing satisfaction, and a general abundance mentality. Don't get excited. Excitement is a fixture of Justin Bieber concerts, not your RP life. **Having and being fun indirectly communicates strength** Nietzsche said: ""To maintain a cheerful attitude of mind in the midst of a gloomy and exceeding responsible task is not slight artistic feat. And yet what could be more necessary than cheerfulness? Surplus power, alone, is the proof of power."" Because a female most often doesn't have the ability to assess the actual strength and power wielded by a man, she is programmed by her biology to observe cues indicating as much. She doesn't need to understand these cues or the automatic process of noting them for them to instinctively trigger sexual attraction. When a woman observes a man who is having fun, she subconsciously assumes (usually rightly) that this man is strong: He's not in a posture of self-protection, bitterly looking outwards in a hesitant non-participator but is maximizing his abilities by experiencing life fully. While not usually associated with stoicism, fun is the icing on top of the stoic cake. Stoicism is strong insulation from mental injury, and fun is an additional layer of said insulation. If Stoicism is the inner strength to achieve freedom from suffering, fun is what one does with such freedom and is evidence of said freedom and the strength from which it springs. **Stoicism is developed through a life-long process of self-improvement and self-acceptance.** This community talks a lot about self-improvement and it should, but the admittedly cringeworthy and cheesy concept of self-acceptance should be touched on as well. Self-acceptance doesn't mean not working to improve your life because you've accepted that you're already good enough. Rather, it becomes useful when one gets in the familiar trap of obsessing over self-improvement, feeling impatient with oneself, and actually harboring low self-esteem due to one's too-brutal expectations for oneself with respect to becoming, growing, improving. Build stoicism slowly and organically through authentic self-improvement. **Stoicism, when incomplete (and it is for me and the great majority of men) should be faked** The value of biting your tongue when bothered by a woman cannot be overstated. Speaking in a retaliatory way out of emotional sensitivity and vulnerability immediately reduces your aura of stoicism and communicates weakness. Read: dry vaginas. Sometimes a man wants to control a woman more than he should. He becomes upset when she doesn't comply in the same fashion that he becomes upset when his computer crashes or internet connection times out: WTF, stop! When one observes this kind of frustration arising from the mind, nip it in the bud. Being transparent about your feelings is not necessarily a useful directive in all or even most cases. Silence is far preferable to expressing frustration. There are obvious exceptions to this. Use the reasonable/alpha man test to moderate to what degree one uses this principle. Instead of expressing frustration, subtle de-investment works best. Your girl says something offensive? Suddenly hanging out with your buddies is a bit more appealing and you bounce with a hug and a kiss. Girl is flaky and is 45 minutes late? Don't get upset: get lost. Caring communicates weakness; weakness is a vagina dehumidifier. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- **TL;DR: Develop and simultaneously fake stoicism in your relations with women to communicate strength and build primal, unnegotiated sexual attraction.**"

I watched an episode not long ago.And boy was I shocked.. and surprised a lot of it is related to red pill theory. Our protagonist, a women, a real estate agent past the wall decides to one night shoot a bullet up her husband's brain as he sits in the couch watching tv. She calls the cops, informs them of her husband's demise and that the culprit is on the run. Supposedly an intruder came in and shot the husband, mumbling something about not getting hired. (the husband was the Fire Chief) We're presented the history of the couple. They met while they were in high school, they were 'high school sweethearts'. They married and got 2 kids. They're active in the community, especially in the church. Thus they're respected and well known by everyone.The husband even more. He went from Fireman to Fire Chief, to Councilman on the side.. he was an appreciated man and well liked man in the community. Present time : Kids left the home.The wife starts up a real estate carreer. She starts travelling to meetings and conventions. She ends up having affairs left and right. (husband has no idea of this) --&gt; She files for divorce. Husband does a 180: starts pulling chairs, being an absolute gentleman, pursues marriage counseling. They stay together, as far as he knows she's happy with him again. Wife keeps her affairs up behind the husband's back. --&gt; She meets a man at one of her business conventions, falls in love with him.They have a short relationship that he breaks off. She keeps trying.He rejects her.She keeps going after him. One day hubbie sits on the couch in front of the tv, and she shoots him in the head. After the act she calls up her ex-lover to share her state of vulnerability and her feelings. Before we proceed, some are probably already concluding that this is an unique case of a deranged women, that has nothing to do with red pill theory. I know better : This is simple women behaviour. It can be explained. Let's look at her progression: It's high school, average girl meets popular guy. Hubbie is described by friends at the time as an Alpha : plays sports, popular, got his gang of guys, was a bit of an ass. Girl is your average american girl, outgoing, doesn't get into trouble, goes to church, possibly a virgin, falls for the jock. Your typical 'highschool couple'.They get married shortly after. (She doesn't ride the cock carousal.Some might describe this girl as the perfect unicorn.A blond-haired church going gal, never rode the carousel, never even had a relationship before.) They have kids, they live the married life. Red Pill Theory : * Kids leave.She gets bored. Starts real estate carreer, starts travelling often. (no kids to raise, husband loses usefulness) * She's good at her job and ends up making even more bucks then her husband. (husband makes less money, loses usefulness and respect) * Husband is alpha at the workplace, but beta at home. He wasn't religious but got converted by her.Friends also described him as willing to do anything for his wife. (got pussywhipped through the marriage, alpha boyfriend now beta husband) (3 red flags,husband has no red pill knowledge and thus no defense.He lost the provider role now though.I suspect this is where respect from the wife plummets. Wife goes travelling on her carreer and is off the leash, free to roam the sexual market.) - While she travels, she goes to bars and conventions and starts having ONS'/affairs. (late start on the cock carousel) --&gt; She's done with the husband and files for divorce.She protects her social status by not revealing her affairs to the husband, keeping him in the dark to what's actually going on. - Husband goes into a panick,doesn't know he's cuckolded, he's blindsided.Has no idea why his marriage is suddenly dying. He tries to save his marriage and the union with in his eyes the most important person in his life. Having no red pill knowledge, he genuinely tries to save it in the way he can.He ups the chivalry and the beta behaviour as high as he can.(That's what his mother thought him, be nice to the girl and she will like you) Adding to that a dose of marriage counseling.(aka a dose of feminist psychology) The wife is 'convinced' to 'stay' with him. (I suspect the wife found it too much of a hassle to file for divorce which would compromise her status in the church social circle.She didn't have an active branch to swing off to either.And perhaps she enjoyed her husband served on a plate to her.She can have her complete beta cuckolded Fire Chief at her mercy and whims while she looks for a new branch.) --&gt; Suddenly she falls in love with this new man she met on one of her business and cock travels. It's a short meeting.She wants more though and keeps trying to uphold contact with the ex-lover. (She's alpha widowed) --&gt; She gets it into her head that if she kills the hubbie her state of vulnerability will seduce her Alpha. - A few hours before killing the hubbie she calls up the Alpha.Has a short conversation with him. She decides that the healthy functioning of beta husband's grey matter is less important then her quest to seduce mister Alpha.She proceeds to shoot him in the head. Beta hubbie dies later on in the hospital, his life ended by the one woman he gave all his love and attention up until the very moment she blew his brain up. He never even knew or saw it coming, he was just watching tv on the couch.As far the relationship goes in his mind they were happily back together after the marriage counseling. After killing the beta hubbie miss alpha widow calls up her 'lover' a few hours later, sharing her state of vulnerability and confessing her feelings once again. Note that she shared with a friend on the same day, that she had fucked some guy, the same day she killed her husband. 3 hours before beta husband died she was riding a stranger's cock, awful I know.Hypergamy can be brutal. The out of control slut got found out, her plan was idiotic.Not that it didn't help to flirt with the investagators the very same day her husband died and describing the 'killer' as a 'nice guy'. She got life without parole. If you want to watch the investigation yourself : [here.](URL Some will say she is just some deranged individual. I say she's a women like all of them. I don't see any particular behaviour that would say she's any different. This woman wasn't on drugs, she wasn't abused, she wasn't in financial trouble, she is your average past the wall cock riding woman. She went to college, got married, raised kids, went to church, was outgoing, no one saw it coming. She simply lost all respect for her beta,went off to find chad,got alpha widowed. I don't see any 'unusual' female behaviour here. She did end up shooting the guy. But it's not like she enjoyed the killing..or that she had a hobby of killing cats and puppies.She hadn't displayed any predatory behaviour. She was just a hypergamous slut like any.She would've filed for divorce, like most of them. It just turned out that by some wild hamstering she got the conception in her head that offing her husband would get her back with her alpha. She didn't ''kill''.In her mind she saw her husband as nothing more then a tool. A tool she was about to discard in a certain way. This is not some crazy killer, this is typical woman behaviour. She had a clear motive, she wasn't out to kill anyone, she was just serving her hypergamy instincts. I'd argue that the huge loss of respect for her beta cuckolded-on-a-daily-basis-husband to the point of seeing him as a tool mixed with the intensity of her alpha chase caused in her a momentary lapse where logic and common sense toke to minimally low levels and Feeels toke to skyhigh ratings. Lessons to learn : ''Unicorns'' : Even an 'unicorn' found before college and the carousel will still turn into a hypergamous slut if left unchecked.Basically expecting a women to keep herself in check is delusion. awalt, whether she's a virgin or a slut. Red Pill saves lives.If that man had been informed by the manosphere I know for a 100 percent he'd still be alive today.Every day men get their lives ruined by women, jail for alimony/false rape charge/false abuse, kids taken away from them, slander in social circles, hard work by blood &amp; sweat poured into ungrateful bitches that keep beta's around their thumbs, gnawing at their souls and mental sanity bit by bit. This is no joke.Red Pill has salvaged my life as well.I'm grateful for that. "

Through a Christian upbringing I believe in the whole nice guy dichotomy, Beta is the only way I know. I buy this girl all sorts of exqusuite gifts, clothes shoes etc etc She meets my family etc etc I think we are in love, she says im her ''husband''. But we haven't had sex but she always wants to be around me - always. I assume that maybe she's broken (Beta Me). What transpires next....... 1. We go out to the club she hooks up with a guy in front of my eyes....I excuse it... 2. Her friends tell me that she fucks someone where she lives....I excuse it.... 3. She hooks up with one of my friends, she apologies profusely... I excuse it.... So here I am 3-0 down, she hooks up with a guy I know. That guy had some surgery done, she had the audacity to ask me to come with her to the hospital to see him imagine! Anyway 6 months later after wasting 1 year of my life, cutting the girl off completely, losing all sense of worth and going into a dark place, grades affected and all, i've undergone major transformational changes. Im new to TRP but I must say the most transformational books i've read pre-TRP that got me out of the gutter and may help some people were **Letters to a Stoic - Seneca** **Self-Reliance - Ralph Waldo Emmerson** **Meditations - Marcus Aurelius** **Letters from a Self Made Merchant to his son**. *(Please Read if you are interested or into business!!)* **What lessons did I learn?** 1) Put yourself, your happiness, your stability (emotional and financial) first! AWALT - Never invest in something that does not appreciate the exercise of investing. 2) Make absolutely no excuses - the earth is your environment, if you dont shape it to work for you, it will shape you - simple! 3) Life is unforgiving, in love, in women, in money, in mortality - make one mistake and you pay. Life Rewards dogged persistence. 4) Like larvae evolves into a butterfly, being a male does not make you a man - you have to evolve! To be a man takes Hardwork, Patience and Rational thinking - the same Buffet said it took to be successful. *Hardwork* = sacrifice of irrelevant pleasures. ie (Financial Stability, eating right) *Patience* = dogged persistence bordering on obssesion (i.e Looks/training) *Rational Thinking* = conscious well thought out logical decisions (i.e on marriage/on career paths (status)). 5) To be successful in life (Money,women,happiness etc) you need vision, know what you want to be, envision it and meditate. A large part of vision is born out of situational awareness. Notice the things around you i.e Know that we live in a world that encourages Beta behavior the same behavior that drove me to some of my darkest moments in life. Always know that the easiest path (what the world accepts) is the shortest path whose cliff has the largest drop. **(Think of how people think its bad to fat shame = encourage people to eat more= die early!)** 6) **Confidence**: DO everything to be confident, lift, lift , lift! Confidence opens so many doors and its so attractive to people and easy to spot! **FINAL LESSON** 7) **FRAMING**: Framing is so important. I wasted 1 year of my life because I did not have a frame of what I wanted in my relations with women. I created vulnerability and got taken advantage of. Frame everything. Now, TRP has served as an incredible tool, I learn so much from all TRP (ers). Given this I would like some of you to share if you had a similar story to mine to show me what resources you drew upon and what you learnt and what you are currently working on? Also if you sense something that I should re-frame or change let me know! "
159,vulnerability,TheRedPill,I love it when feminist progressives eat their own...

As you would expect, her rant was childish and misogynistic and misandrist-- the hallmarks of modern feminism. Well, apparently another female professor criticized the article, while pointing out it's extreme misogyny: &gt;Its the fiction of the all-powerful professor embedded in the new campus codes that appalls me. And the kowtowing to the fictionkowtowing wrapped in a vaguely feminist air of rectitude. If this is feminism, its feminism hijacked by melodrama. The melodramatic imaginations obsession with helpless victims and powerful predators is whats shaping the conversation of the moment, to the detriment of those whose interests are supposedly being protected, namely students. The result? Students sense of vulnerability is skyrocketing. Now, what do you think happened to this female professor as a result of voicing her honest opinion contrary to the feminist orthodoxy? She hurt someone's feelings, and now she's being investigated for violating Title IX. Ten years ago, you would think that this was an Onion parody. But, today, it's just normal operating procedure for the feminist progressive Thought Police. "
160,vulnerability,TheRedPill,The Winter of our Discontent: why morality is holding you back,0,31bjk1,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/31bjk1/the_winter_of_our_discontent_why_morality_is/,2015-04-04 02:55:03,"Don't worry, this won't be another ""check out this RP book"" thread. The Winter of our Discontent was the book that planted a seed of thought that eventually - although years later - led to me swallowing the red pill. And here's what I learned from it: As an introduction I'll briefly describe the book. Ethan is a man from an established family in an old whaling town. Because of personal failure and bad advice he has been a grocery clerk for over a decade. His wife is ashamed of him and his kids disrespect him. Ethan comes to realize that he has lost everything and is unable to get it back because he stuck to his morals. He starts to look around and see that all successful people have no morals. So he decides he's fed up with it, makes some amoral decisions and gains back his wealth, status, kids' respect and wife's sexual interest. Now, let's take this story and look at our own lives. Why does a 30 year old man hesitate to fuck an 18 (or 16, in Europe) year old girl, even though it's legal? Because everyone around him will try to shun him. *""It just isn't right"", ""divide by two plus seven bro"", ""can't handle a woman your own age?.* Sounds familiar? Women couldn't care less about the vulnerability of teenage girls, but it provides a nice excuse to reduce the fierce competition of girls half their age. Men introspect and get mad, because they're getting duty sex from their chubby post-wall wives and you are banging fit young girls. Let's hear some more of those well-known moral accusations, this time about marriage. *you just need to grow up, a real man takes responsibility, shit or get off the pot.* Again, the main concept is that **society uses morals to push you into giving up your own needs for stability.** Everyone around you will push you for their own good and shun you when you dont comply. **What you need to do is acknowledge that morality is a tool for oppressing men and ignore this noise accordingly.** There is a reason there is a difference between things that are illegal and immoral. When something is illegal, the system of justice protects people by punishing violation accordingly. When something is considered immoral, society or large groups of people try to get a grip on you for their own benefit. And once you realize this, the grip is as strong as a buttered hand on a fish.

161,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Why most of today's women aren't worthy of your commitment.,475,32290l,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/32290l/why_most_of_todays_women_arent_worthy_of_your/,2015-04-10 10:09:05,"If you're Machiavellian and understand women you will have no problem managing female bullshit. The real problem I think is most guys find the cherry just isn't sweet enough. That's to say, although YOU COULD manage her YOU'RE JUST NOT SUFFICIENTLY INCENTIVISED TO DO SO. Most women aren't worth the extra effort, simply enough. They take more than they give. For access to a vagina you have to: - Have her put all her worries and stress on you - Listen to her boring, empty, vapid social observations - Deal with her whining/being menstrual/insecure - Deal with her crazy whenever it rears its's head And you have to deal with all that like a champ, stoically, because if you lose frame too much the relationship is fucked and she doesn't even want you anymore even though she's, to be quite blunt: an insufferable cunt. You pay so much in spirit and mental energy being in a relationship with a woman. Pussy can be had cheaper. If women have shit personalities, why do you want relationships with them? Most women have absolutely no personality that makes them worth commitment. What women don't seem to understand, flying off auto-pilot on their looks in youth, is that a hot tight body only attracts men, it doesn't keep them around. She will lose her beauty. You actually need to be mildly interesting and/or good-natured to be relationship material. So what do we do? We fuck and chuck. Don't get me wrong, I think a lot of men would like a family - but it has to be with the right woman. Not a dim, boring, narcissistic empty shell of a human-being. Personally I rather never reproduce than put my children through the pain of being raised by a stupid, horrible, whiny self-entitled woman. I don't even care if she's good to the kids, if she's a cunt to me the kids will see that and it will affect them detrimentally. That's not how I imagine raising a family, you either DO IT RIGHT or you don't bother doing it at all. LTRs should be mother material - most women nowadays aren't mothers because they deserve to be, but simply because they stopped taking their birth control. Too many whores are fucking dragging kids up nowadays, not raising them right - and that's why we have all the problems we do in society. Millennials are a mess because of divorce and single mothers. I don't want to put my kids through that bullshit. If she puts herself above family, she's not a woman I ever see as anything other than a hole to be used for my momentary leisure. **Not only is the reward lower, but the effort necessary is higher. So you're playing on a higher difficulty for a lower prize.** - You have to be vigilant, you can't let your guard down or give into your kindness, because she will exploit it and see you as less for ""showing weakness."" - You have less sexual options than if you were single, this one woman is controlling your sexual preferences, and then she'll play games where she doesn't put out to control you. Basically, bitches weaponise your libido against you and then force you to listen to their feelings if you cant sufficiently dread/headfuck them. But if you stray to get your release then it's not her fault, it's yours, you're the evil one. - She knows you better so she's better at head fucking you. She'll press all your buttons, say shit plates wouldn't know. Say some shit about your mother, say some shit you told her about your childhood. Whatever. Basically any fucking thing you think is sacred she's going to use against you to ""test you"" and also because bitches are just plain crazy and hormonal and are going to lash out at some point. She's meant to be a partner but you can't even properly open up to her without her abusing that shit. And it's not a matter of IF, it's a matter of WHEN. - Likewise as she knows you better she's more immune to your techniques/strategies/mannerisms. She will become immune to different gambits/coping mechanisms you use like a fucking disease growing resistant to antibiotics. So you need to change your shit up or it'll all fall apart. - You have to keep reinventing yourself and being inconsistent, or she gets bored and looks elsewhere for cock on the side. Society/her family will support her in this and she'll just rationalise you're a cunt. - You don't really get a break. You don't get to let your guard down. Because if you do she freaks out and fucks off. Momentary vulnerability can only be superficial/aesthetic in nature. If you're LEGITIMATELY VULNERABLE she will dry up and abandon you. So the work you put in IS IMMEASURABLE and the reward is negligible. It's a terrible investment. When women make relationship demands, they're just being selfish. Women have nothing but benefit to gain from a relationship with a man. Associating with a man improves their life. Men lose so much spiritually from being in a relationship with the modern day woman that these women just aren't worth it. When women started saying they don't have to give a man they're committed to sex whenever he wants, but the man still has to put up with all their shit - they instantly became unworthy. Some guys could soldier on through women with shitty personalities if the sex was always there, they could overlook it - but with a lot of these bitches now not even that's a given. **There's so much hard work, energy and bullshit involved in being in a relationship - and the reward just isn't there. What's it all for? Pussy? You can get that single. Love? Most these chicks aren't loveable. They aren't what we want psychologically. Thanks feminism.** Men are beings of rational self-interest. They respond well to incentives. If women were worth it, men would commit to them. They're not, so we don't. Women are pretty fucking shitty for anything other than momentary fun. Relationship-worthy women are probably .1% of the entire population because society is sick and women put career/individuality above family. I don't find career women attractive. I find family-orientated women attractive. When women stopped making an effort to be loveable to men, the only thing keeping men in love with women was their delusions. Once those delusions are stripped away, there is fuck all left. Most women aren't people you actually want as friends or people you have significant mental input with. They're just holes for fucking, or you ignore 'em. Sad it's come to that, but it is what it is. In light of this I don't LTR up girls with any depth. What I mean is, I don't expect it to last, and I seem invested, but really I'm not. I pretend to care, but I don't give a fuck. They're all research and practice to me. I'm not actually ""in love"" she hasn't ""got me"" she has me spending time on her (which is what she wants - commitment) but I don't form the emotional attachment because they lack the qualities necessary for me to want to even attempt caring about them. When you LTR an unworthy woman, you either treat her like a practice bitch or you get taken for a ride and come out of it significantly worse. **To conclude:** Women fail a cost-benefit analysis. Plating is the habitable zone, relationships nowadays are like emigrating to Mercury, too near to the sun you're gonna get burned, living conditions are shittier than they are on Earth. You wouldn't invest in a depreciating stock, well women are the same - they are constantly depreciating in value only to increase their demands/preferences/entitlement as they age. Women do not rationally appraise their dating value. They defy the market by increasing rather than decreasing their demands as their beauty dissipates. Retardedly and quite ironically, as they get less physically attractive, they likewise become less mentally attractive. Wanna know what a woman's maturity brings? It doesn't bring about intelligence, enlightenment or more reasonable expectations. It brings about more baggage, more unrealistic expectations and a more emphatic anti-male sentiment. THEY MAKE THEMSELVES EVEN LESS ATTRACTIVE PSYCHOLOGICALLY AS THEY AGE, WHICH IS IRONIC, BECAUSE THEY'RE ALSO LESS PHYSICALLY ATTRACTIVE. Women age like shit, both in body and in soul. If you can't buy in when she's at her peak, why are you going to buy in when she isn't? When women are physically worth it but not mentally, they're not interested. Good luck even finding a woman who's hot, young and doesn't have the personality of a cunt. Essentially the older a woman gets, the less desirable she gets whilst becoming more difficult and entitled. The wall is real. Some old bitches smartened up and realised being submissive/sweet/docile was the only way they'd ever get a guy to stick around. So they take dick up their wrinkly ass, cook well and work hard on behaving like less of an insufferable cunt. You know, they do yoga, try to read shit, have a personality, avoid toxic crap like sex in the city and idle gossip. Less of a simpleton, less of a bitch. Most women who are past it however choose cats and the feminist ideal of hyper-individualised dignity rather than put in the work to change themselves so an older man sees her as being even remotely worth a fuck. To the very end women are defiant. They would shame men into compliance rather than become what men want. Why would you want to invest any significant mental capital into that?

162,vulnerability,TheRedPill,"""Doing You"" or ""Being You"": True Confidence and How to be Authentically Powerful",32,32u6va,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/32u6va/doing_you_or_being_you_true_confidence_and_how_to/,2015-04-17 05:12:58,"I'll keep this short and sweet, starting with a question: Is ""you"", something that you do or is it something that you are? Think about it for a second. There is a common phrase in the hip-hop community, [""I'mma do me""](URL which illustrates that many rappers personality is made up of posturing for the sole purpose of looking more powerful. Which is why you hear about ""Braggadocio"" in rap. Just look at the guy in the video, really listen to what he is saying. Would a truely powerful man be doing and saying that stuff? Would he be going around telling everyone how powerful he is? Fuck no. There is no need, he has secured his power, all that he does by telling people that he has power is he invites resentment, jealousy and attacks. Mark Manson calls this posturing false confidence in his famous book, Models. If you want to learn about being more genuine with your personality and you haven't read that book yet, stop reading this article and go buy the book. Rappers are ""doing"" themselves. What they are, their identity is literally an act for the world to see. That's partly why they are such great entertainers, because they are deeply motivated by the need to appear a certain way. They understand they are just a part of the show for you to enjoy, and they take their part very seriously. Ever heard another phrase ""dont take yourself so seriously.""? That is saying a person is overly concerned with the current manifestation of their personality or the role they are trying to play. As a side note you can learn a hell of a lot from closely examining language but I digress. Confident men are ""being"" themselves. What they are, or their identity, is a state of being. It is effortless. They dont need to try to be themselves, they instead allow themselves to just be as they are. They aren't trying to look cool, they arent trying to act more dominant, they arent trying to micro manage their behavior just so they can appear like an ideal them. Confident men understand and accept that they are not perfect, that there will be times when they are ""off their game"" so to speak. Times where they may appear weak. For example times where youre tired and overworked and you still have to socialize. In response to these situations the confident man chooses to continue being himself, whether it appears weak, or any other negatively judged trait. This is called **vulnerability**. You may have heard of it. Confident men have nothing to prove to the world because they have let go of the needy pursuit to appear cool, and if they are smart they have replaced that pursuit with a better one; the pursuit to be powerful. This is the true purpose of self development. The true purpose of why we are all here. Why we study the red pill, why we read FRs and go lift and meditate. To become a stronger and more powerful man because that man is free. That man is not bound to peoples opinions of him, he is not hindered by needing to appear attractive, he is not a slave to his own image. He is free to express and develop himself in the most powerful and congruent way that he sees fit. Ween yourself off of validation. Get addicted to freedom and true power. That is why we are all here."
163,vulnerability,TheRedPill,[FR] HB 10 and wannabe alphas.,1,33426e,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/33426e/fr_hb_10_and_wannabe_alphas/,2015-04-19 19:19:28,"So this is a pretty good one. I got a few numbers, but the one that stood out was this HB 10 I starting talking to in line at a club. She was about an inch taller WITH NO high heels on, gorgeous, working actress, and pretty interesting overall. And here is the thing: If I hadn't just read Models about a week ago, I never would have gotten her attention for a full 20 minutes, let alone her number. Now I'm not saying that numbers are amazing, or even hard to get. But for me, I had horrible social skills and major approach anxiety. 6 months ago I sucked at carrying on a conversation for more than 10 seconds. So anyways, here is what I did right and what I could have done better. Right: I stayed present and didn't try to impress her. I didn't seek validation, and even had her qualifying herself to me. I push pulled. I kept the conversation going with ""jump off points"" from Models. Most importantly, I showed vulnerability by sharing some polarizing stuff about myself, which worked out really well when she liked it. This is my first time trying this technique from Models, and it worked out really well. She gave me her number without me asking, and even suggested an activity we could do. What I could have done better: I didn't touch her enough, even though she started out touching me a lot. After we got into the club, I didn't lead us to another activity. Instead I went to talk to other people. This could be good or bad, but if I had had more experience or confidence, I maybe could have taken her home. Now, for the second interesting part. Late into the night, everyone was happy and chill. There was a live band playing, and the crowd was really friendly. In walks two tall, buff dudes. Good for them, right? Except that these guys are SO aggressive and over the top that the night just sucks for them. It starts out with these two bulldozing their way to the middle of the crowd and pinning these two girls between them. They're making so much nose and acting like they don't give a fuck SO MUCH that nobody could possibly take them seriously. As soon as they get a chance, the girls go back to the shorter, uglier dudes they were dancing with before. They didn't even come with these guys. They just preferred them over the wannabe alphas. The girls try to take selfies, and these guys keep getting in the pictures. The girls move against a wall so that they can't. I start dancing with a girl, and one of the guys yells something about how hot she is at her while getting really close. She says thanks and leaves the dance floor. These guys are pussy repellent. Just for fun, I follow them around for five minutes. These guys are aggressive, and if they played it right, they wouldn't really need to lift a finger. Instead, they are getting blown out left and right. This STILL wouldn't be too bad, if it was just fun and games to them. But they are getting visibly upset. What's the lesson? Even if you are tall, good looking, and buff, woman will be turned off by your lack of confidence. These guys showed that by trying WAY too fucking hard. So that's my field report. Good luck out there, gentlemen. "
164,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Repost - simple kino guide,65,33kp31,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/33kp31/repost_simple_kino_guide/,2015-04-23 18:29:29,"I've been perusing through the sub and realized a lot of people have been asking questions about kino and I have a notebook full of seduction information so let me try to help. Kinesthetics: Kino is short for Kinesthetics. The basic definition of kino is physical contact that is initiated with a female. Now in this guides definition we'll stick to that exact definition with a little addition. Kino for us will be physical contact that is purposely initiated with a women to escalate sexually, express our sexuality, to build rapport, and to establish the level of relationship. That is the purpose of this physical contact. The reason kino is important is aside from its aforementioned benefits and uses, it builds connection. For instance you won't be holding a girls hand the second you meet her, instead you'll most likely be using a lower level of kino: Shaking Hands Hugging Kiss on the cheek Escalate sexually: Kino can be used to escalate sexually. For instance, if you tell a girl ""wow something smells amazing, is it you?"" and you lean in to smell her and brush the hair so you can smell her neck, thats a pretty sexual move. However, know the level you are at with a girl. You won't be doing this with a girl you just met, unless you are not afraid to lose the girl. Build rapport: After you have met the girl, you need to start building rapport. And of course rapport is mostly an emotional connection, it typically follows with the physical. A guy gets horny, its an emotion, he will begin to touch his girl or himself if he's alone (however nofap all the way :) ). Anyways, to build rapport you should always keep in mind that emotion usually comes first then physicality after. For example, if a girl begins to cry or have an emotional outbreak, your first reaction will be to try to comfort her by giving her a hug, holding her hand, bringing her closer to you, or rubbing her back to relax her. These are all moves that show you are more than friends, and help build rapport. Furthermore, kino can also be reciprocated by a women. If you are alone with a girl and you hug her and hold her hand, it shows that she trusts you and you have the right level of rapport with her. It shows you that she's okay with being vulnerable to you physically. This also shows that you trust her enough to express yourself sexuality. Bringing me to my next point.... Expressing your sexuality: Sometimes we like to touch women other than ourselves, so lets get serious over here. Express your sexuality, but make sure the correct level of rapport and relationship status is built. When you show your sexuality, by bringing a girl into you as you wrap your arms around her, or when you smack her ass. It shows that you want her, through physical contact emotions are expressions. The chain of events usually goes as follows: making eye contact, kino, kissing, sexual kino, and then sex. As you go through each event, you are displaying your sexuality in a deeper and more vulnerable level. She is also becoming more vulnerable as you escalate the kino through the chain of events. Places on a woman that are open to kino: URL Escalation moves: When introducing yourself: hug, kiss on the cheek ( depends on environment), and handshake. Handshake is safest, hug is a little more riskier, and kiss on the cheek is riskiest. &lt;--- Based on my opinion. Simple escalation to start further contact(Depends on environment again...): high five, hand on her shoulder when laughing, hand on back to guide her, adjusting her hair, smelling her, taking lint off her shirt. Further contact before kissing: Holding her hand, massaging her, hand on her back (again) to guide her in a direction. Tickling her, hugging her, etc. To get the kiss, theres a shit ton of ways to do this but I personally do this: Eye contact, bring her closer to you, look at her lips and just kiss her. When she already trusts you and you have most likely kissed: When she's walking around in her/your apartment (preparing drinks, looking at something, whatever), slowly approach from behind, touch her hips, get close to her ear, smell her. Then move her hair to the side and kiss/bite her neck. (amadeus_x) ( I do this all the time, since I was about 16 and the girls just get soaked) After this, just have sex. You can escalate more, but its almost sexy time from here :) Pretty much from this point, after the kiss, your maneuvering of the hands illustrates your sexuality and your vulnerability. It tells the girl how much you want her, and also HOW MUCH SHES WILLING TO GIVE. Pay attention to how she reciprocates kino, how she reacts when you touch her, and how much she allows you to touch her. Edit: really old post."
165,vulnerability,TheRedPill,The Red Pill of James Hetfield and Modern Day Pedestal Smashing,37,33yxfz,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/33yxfz/the_red_pill_of_james_hetfield_and_modern_day/,2015-04-27 09:18:40,"[In my last](URL post I examined eighteenth century pedestal smashing in the form of Jonathan Swifts poem The Ladies Dressing Room where a naive young gent discovers that his cherished girlfriend is an illusion made up of glue, clay, and colored wax. His inexperience with women was evident in his clumsy discovery that women also take nasty, steamy dumps just as men do. In his writing The Ladies Dressing Room, Swift probably felt the same feelings a lot of modern men have with women- that their willingness to so readily deceive through both aesthetics and behavior is not only immoral, dishonorable, and crude but also greatly skews the sexual marketplace in their favor where the majority of men already have women on a pedestal; to a greater or lesser extent depending on the depth of their own experience. **Enter James Hetfield.** Before Metallica were collectively driven mad by the trappings of their own success they were a beloved staple of the heavy metal community for embodying what was the *anti-rock star*, a novel concept for the late 1980s. Running opposed to the overt bravado and endless excess of other popular rock acts of the time, like Motley Crue, the boys in Metallica seemed downright low-key and tame. They were musicians foremost and rock stars as a distant second. After all, they were made of up a shy, socially awkward frontman, a comic loving geeky lead guitarist, and an impish, effeminate European drummer. These were not the guys getting laid in high school. Success hit like a ton of bricks. **So what happens when a group of awkward, beta guys suddenly find tremendous success?** They get married! It doesnt matter if its the beta geek who spends his twenties with a dry dick and a head buried in medical text books, the middle-management dummy drooling over his washed-up club girl, or the awkward rock star who has the attention of a girl he never thought hed be in the same zip-code with as a sixteen year old. Its always the same story. So James, as the song writer and lyricist of Metallica, falls head-over-heels for some pretty young girl and suddenly he thinks hes in love. As a result, Hetfield pens his first and only love song, the beautifully constructed and haunting Nothing Else Matters. **Nothing. Else. Matters.** Poor bastard had no idea what he was in for, did he? With lyrics about vulnerability and trust, you can surmise that James felt he stumbled into the real deal; he let his guard down and believed the myth of egalitarian love. The record with Nothing Else Matters went on to sell thirty million copies, embarked the band on a multi-year world tour, they all ended up divorced, and they collectively lost their minds. I couldnt possibly know the specifics of Hetfields relationship woes, but I can take a good guess based on how their next album, the mangled 1996 record Load, starts out the gate with a track called *Aint My Bitch*. And it appears that in the five years between albums, Mr. Hetfield became acquainted with a certain Red Pill. The rest of Load revealed a vulnerable Hetfield, tortured and mentally distraught, a feeling of desperation and urgency prevailed in songs like Bleeding Me, The Outlaw Torn, and Thorn Within. A bizarre record where truly dark material met a mid-nineties radio sheen. The bands follow up, recorded concurrently with Load and aptly titled ReLoad, featured more of the same material thematically. In the first single, **The Memory Remains**, Hetfield stands squarely in the shards of his shattered pedestal and addresses venomously the finite nature of female power. The song details a fading starlet, in denial of her aging out of Hollywood, as Hetfield commands her to ***dance, little tin goddess*.** Hetfield here recognizes that female power is based primarily on how well they can demonstrate the *illusion of perfection* how high the men they attract can erect a pedestal in their honor, as he had in the past, as the fictitious Strephon had in [The Ladies Dressing Room](URL as men always will. As a compliment to his pointed lyrics, to drive home his point, Hetfield employed an outside vocalist for the only time in Metallica history: the aging, withered, decisively unfeminine voice of Marianne Faithful; a clear reality check for any young starlet. Age and experience had taught James Hetfield a powerful lesson; while the little girl may feel like a goddess, *shes only made of tin*; **the power she wields is an illusion, and this power is only significant when there are men who fall for the illusion and validate it as reality**.

166,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Frequently asked questions (Please read this topic before asking),30,2y5knf,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2y5knf/frequently_asked_questions_please_read_this_topic/,2015-03-07 04:35:02,"**How many chances should I give this girl? She keeps flaking!** * Don't tolerate flaking at all. It indicates she doesn't respect your time. There are more options out there in the world. You may allow one flake if the circumstances are reasonable. * One. Flaking on a date, especially a first date, is a massive shit test that you only pass by nexting her. * Pursuing a girl after she flakes the first time is not always a waste of time. Girls will flake on you even when they're interested, especially if you haven't met them in person yet. Wait a week and text ""whats up flaky mcflakster"" and set up another date while forgetting about it. It's worked for me a couple times and it's only a small investment. **My GF / Plate told me I need to wait X amount of time before sex, what gives?** * She either isn't attracted to you and wants to string you along, or doesn't want to seem like a slut. Everyone has their own limits, but three dates is the standard waiting time for modern relationships. You may have your own ideas. Just be wary of being strung along. * She's sizing you up to see if you are her beta bux; particularly if she's in the 27 to 31 age range. If a girl is in the 18 to 23 age range, and she's making you hold out for sex, there is a slight possibility that, no, she doesn't want to ride the carousel. But if she's late 20's, it's almost certain she's given it up on the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd dates to other men. Don't pay new car prices for a used Honda Civic. **Where are the best venues to bring a girl on a blind date / First meet up?** * Somewhere with little time/cash investment, where you can either depart from if it is not a match, or move to another location where you can take the date further. * Absolutely nowhere that can be construed as a ""formal date"". No dinners, no movies, etc. Keep it to coffee shops and local bars, and never spend more than $40 on a woman on a date. Ever. Never buy her dinner. That's what she expects Beta Bux to do. If she scoffs at you not paying for her, NEXT. **How do I get her Number?** * Give her your phone with the ""new contact"" page open and demand it. Never give her your number. That's entering her frame. * Once you have a girl hooked (she is asking you personal questions) ask for her number and then **leave** **My GF says she's on the pill, do I still need a condom?** * yes * If you trust her (you shouldn't) then go for it. Are you willing to pay 20% of your income to her for 18+ years? * google ""baby rabies"" **She takes too long to respond to my texts, am I doing something wrong?** * It's hard to know. You may be over-eager and are turning her off. She may not be into you and is stringing you along. Shift your attention toward other things and you'll stop thinking about it. * Yes. You're answering her texts too quickly, and she's sidelining you for later while she texts Chad Thundercock. * You should only be texting for logistics **My best friend is struggling with his girlfriend and being pushed around like a tool, how do i get him to follow TRP?** * Most will say this doesn't work. He has to be sufficiently motivated himself to improve. Trying to educate him may risk his backlash, or the backlash of your social group. TRP is commonly misunderstood and you may come up on the wrong side of it. Proceed with caution. * You don't. TRP is to be found and swallowed, not force fed. **My GF hasn't slept with me in one month, is this relationship worth it?** * Depends what you want from the relationship. If you're just in it for sex, then no, it's not worth it. However, you can turn this around if she's a quality woman and some other issue is at play. Work on making yourself more appealing. If this doesn't get the results over a time period you're comfortable with, then you have to make a tough choice. **Is marriage worth it anymore?** * Given the state of hypergamy, the thankless role of the husband, and the current nature of divorce laws, many men say it is not worth it. Read ""Men on Strike"" by Dr. Helen Smith. * nope * no * absolutely not **Why doesn't my GF appreciate all the little things I do for her? She doesn't even acknowledge it!** * She may be entitled. You may not be giving her what she actually wants through the ""little things."" This may also be an indication that she doesn't respect you. * Because of **ALL THE THINGS** you are doing for her. Things given repeatedly are no longer seen as gifts, they are seen as expectations. See Valentines Day as the biggest representation of this; it is not ""special"" that you get your GF a gift, you will be labeled an asshole by society if you don't give a gift. Rare things are valuable, common things are worthless. And ""all of the little things"" have become as common and worthless to her as dirt. **My GF asked me to vent to her and so I did. Now she's pushing me away, is this normal?** * Completely. Nothing repulses a woman more than a man who's emoting like a woman. * Women are confused by vulnerability. They say they like it, but it confuses their perception of the typical male role. So yes, it is normal with certain women. Vent with your friends, or if it is a serious issue, with a professional. **How should a man handle it when a female is obviously ""fishing for a complaint""?** * You don't bite. Her: ""What do you think of this shirt?"" Let's say her nice juicy tits are hanging out. You: ""It fits."" * [Read this](URL * My approach is to pause, smile and continue the conversation, letting her know I am aware of what she is trying to do and that I am not going to feed into it. I have also tried calling them on it but you basically just get the same old line, ""No I wasn't"" BS. **How do you maintain a friendship with a girl without becoming a beta orbiter?** * You don't expect to fuck her if you're her friend and want to ""maintain a friendship."" Unless you're aloof and she always had this sexual attraction to you that she only got to act on once or twice. It has to be you who chose to make her a friend, not the other way around. That will fuck with her ego. * A friendship means that each person provides value to the other person. What value does she provide you? If it's nothing then you are an orbiter. **Why do woman talk about men so much? Just look at all the music video's by them.** * We are the only natural and meaningful purpose to their lives. * Men provide the framework in which they live. Male attention is their only true source of happiness. * They need us more then we need them. **What are the boundaries you should set in an LTR?** * The key is not what, but when. Boundaries have to be clearly established from the beginning. It's confusing (and unfair if we go down that route) to start setting boundaries later on, or changing what are dealbreakers for you. And the only way to do that naturally (and not be exasperated by an effort) is to know internally what your own boundaries are, and keep your integrity. If you know that you want to be able to chill with your boys and ditch her last minute, and you truly internalize that, then it's not a struggle to maintain a boundary. If you want to be able to say ""fuck you, I need alone time haha!"" then that can't come a year later. It can't be faked boundaries simply because you think you need to maintain your frame, because then if you're truly with her long term, you'll ""break"". It simply has to be part of your integrity. And remember: if that's truly a boundary of yours, you don't want to be with someone who fights you on that anyway. Easy abundance shortcut: ""You wouldn't want to be with her anyway if she doesn't respect that."" * Exclusivity. No other men but you. This will of course include sex and intimacy. Absolutely nothing physical with any other guy. Each guy will have their own threshold beyond that. Some may not want them to flirt with guys in front of them, others will be flattered by that, for example. Some may demand that she doesn't spend time with guys who are clearly interested in her, but others may be confident enough that this is not a problem. Dealing with exes falls into this category too. * Respect. First, she respects your time. This means she doesn't take you for granted. She respects your opinion (even if she disagrees with it) enough to listen to it and not reject it wholesale. Also, she maintains respect in public. Modern women are fond of exposing a guy's vulnerabilities in front of others or friends to feed their vanity or to shit test. Demand respect on all fronts. **How far into the first date should you kiss? As soon as possible?** * If you are on a date other than blind date, the reality is: 1) She likes you enough to invest her time and effort into you. 2) She considers your social status high enough for her to be potentially seen with you by her peers and feel OK with it, or even better, proud of it. 3) She willingly accepted to be alone with you, thus opening the opportunity for you to man up and escalate. Considering that reality, the only answer can be: simply assertively escalate as far as you can until she stops (or doesn't stop) you. If you feel afraid to do it, go back to increasing your SMV, which will lead to you having more options, which will lead to acquiring abundance mindset, which in turn will lead to you stop being afraid of doing it. * Go for cheek kiss for the greeting. If she, as you are going in, does not turn and present her cheek, go for a lip kiss. This sets the filter through which all other behaviors on the date will be perceived through. Continue to escalate throughout the date. **Does someone have extensive experience in explaining amused mastery with some common examples? TRM does a good job but it seems to me that is the lifeblood of keeping things light and fun rather than letting things get bogged down by feeeelings and Rollo's blog post on it doesn't delve too deeply into examples of it.** * Amused mastery is hard to demonstrate with specific examples. It's a part of your overall frame and it should be internalized so you revert to the behaviour automatically with women. I've always thought amused mastery is a much deeper concept than something like ""agree and amplify"", where giving examples is easy. A few ways to do this: Everything she says and everything she does is ""cute"" -- This reframe puts your heart and mind in the right place. When she says, ""You just want me for sex!"", look at her with a cheeky grin and think, ""Aw"", before you act. Treat her like your bratty kid sister -- even if you never had a sister growing up, think of a situation where the younger sister wants to play with the two older brothers. They want to play football and roughhouse in the yard and she wants to join in. Obviously you don't tackle her with all your strength, you make fun of her for throwing like a girl, let her think she's about to win then crush her etc. Treat her concerns as you would those of a child -- kids say the darnedest things. You don't get into debates with children or explain why their behaviour is wrong from an ethical or logical standpoint. You placate them and play to their emotions. Pretty much, all of these boil down to not taking women seriously. That is what's at the heart of amused mastery. Thank you all for contributing in the original thread.

167,vulnerability,TheRedPill,1.) Balancing the Vulnerability Game and Being the Woman's Rock; and 2.) Artificial vs. Effortless Disinterest and Outcome Independence,6,2zbnze,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2zbnze/1_balancing_the_vulnerability_game_and_being_the/,2015-03-17 17:00:52,"**1.)** I mentioned the passing of my late friend recently to this girl. She asked if I was ok, I told her yeah or something like that. Then I mentioned my friend again after an event related to him was brought up. She told me I wasn't ok because I kept mentioning him despite telling her that I'm ok. I told her I'm ok. End of Story. **First Person POV:** I wasn't even thinking of it as a shit test back then. It was only lately that it snapped at me suddenly. Back then, of course I am affected by the loss of my friend, but I told her I'm ok because that's how I was. I told her I'm ok, because I don't need her help (or any of my other friends for this case alone). I'm not exactly ok of course, but I'm dealing with it accordingly and sufficiently so there's no need for any additional stuff. Although if there's something I learned about life crises, it's that you'll never know whether the next shit that'll hit you will be so hard it'll break you and all your bones down to the very core. **Analysis:** Remember how girls will try to make you lean on them or make you talk to her about your problems? That's what snapped at me all of a sudden. While part of it *might* be because they care about you, you can sure as hell bet that if you start venting out and need or want them to comfort you like a mom or something, their attraction will skyrocket downward. It's one thing to mention your problems if it's just how the conversation went, like because it was an interesting story or something like that, but to keep at it because you need her as a crying shoulder is a totally different thing. Yeah, I guess that's the fine line between vulnerability game and being her rock - you *may* talk about your problems with her as the case may be, but don't make her dwell on it and use her as a crying shoulder. You're the man in the relationship so play the role. [Here](URL is a similar field report to this but is far heavier by a ton and more powerful than this one. **2.)** This other girl started playing dread game on me. You know those silly tactics of mentioning other guys and stuff like that? She took it to another level and actually dated one. Did I care? Nope. Are we still going at it? Yep. AF/BB. I think she was also negotiating the sexual favors now. **First Person POV:** While some dudes here might think that it's a beta move on my part to keep at it once she started dating someone else (or more), I can imagine the point, but I could really care less. You know those red flags? Once she started showing me those, or two, she's already been branded as a plate. Also, let's not flatter ourselves too much here and start thinking that our plates are made always only made of unthinking loyal slaves. Some might be, but it takes two to tango so it's not just about who you are, but also about who you picked up and pulled in, and what her tactics of choice are. For my case, she can cook for me all the food she wants, or date others and non-verbally bargain the sex to make me chase her, but nope. No amount of sexual bargaining or hoarding can pull me into that. Once she's been branded a plate, I've already went into whatever mode even before she started dating anybody else who isn't me. She can leave me, sure, but whatever, it just means time for me to go hunting again, which I already started, by the way. **Analysis:** I figured there must be two kinds of disinterest (or outcome independence as well). One is the artificial and the other is effortless. If you have to hit the gym and sweat it out, post on AskTRP, go fuck 10 other bitches, or even talk and meet up with your other plates, then it's artificial. That is because when you have to do something or tell yourself something just to draw your mind away from the matter, it essentially means that you are affected in the first place. Otherwise, you might've just done something so minimal it's negligible or even nothing other than just get on with your life, which is the other type of disinterest or outcome independence: the effortless one. It's when, well, you just don't care. I'm not exactly sure how to get there, but I presume one way is by having your mind sincerely focused on your passions and projects, instead of just spending your time on them because that's what TRP, or other seduction material, told you to do to as a strategy to pull in some more girls."

It may not seem directly relevant here on TRP, but the guy oblivious to all this is vulnerable to entrapment in a hero's role he craves. ## 12 Stage Heros Journey Cultural anthropologist Joseph Campbell wrote, A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder. Fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won. The hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons to his fellow man. Heres the Secret Hollywood Formula used for many movie epics **1. The Ordinary World**  set stage in humble home village **2. The Hook**  the lead character and their quest (problem to solve, wrong to right, girl to get) **3. The Inciting Incident**  hero pushed into seeking a solution **4. Crossing a Threshold**  stepping from old world into new, quest begins, a mentor/wizard emerges who prepares the hero for the perilous journey ahead **5. Trials, Tribulations, &amp; Temptations**  series of challenges, allies and enemies revealed **6. The Great Challenge**  an impasse is reached, potentially fatal flaws and the impossible task ahead are unveiled **7. Escalating Stakes**  the edge of a dangerous place is reached **8. The Darkest Moment**  defeat appears imminent **9. Death &amp; Rebirth**  transformation occurs, new powers bestowed, the magical sword is won **10. Final Ordeal**  hero prevails, antagonist vanquished **11. Journey Home**  escape with treasure, thwart vengeful forces **12. Triumphant Return**  sharing boon with tribe Along with the outward journey, the hero undertakes an inner journey. And its this inner journey that often resonates deepest with your reader/audience because it mirrors the idealization of their life story. ## 10 Hollywood Story Formulas Screenwriter Blake Snyder outlined these 10 story formulas Hollywood uses to create movies: **1. Dude with a Problem.** Hero minding own business, when BAM... things go bad and keep getting worse by the minute. The hero needs to overcome improbable odds to survive and save the day. 3 Forces: innocent hero, unexpected event, furious battle Examples: Die Hard, The Fugitive, Speed, Apollo 13, Bourne Identity. **2. Golden Fleece.** This is an epic journey to reach an epic goal with many challenges along the way. The quest requires assembling a special team to accomplish the goal and win a seemingly unreachable prize. 3 Forces: road, team, prize Examples: Finding Nemo, Star Wars, Avengers, Lord of the Rings, Saving Private Ryan, Princess Bride. **3. Buddy Love.** A hero struggles alone until a catalyst character (second hero) shows up. Initially antagonistic, they forge a bond through conflicts and challenges to become a team and win against great odds. 3 Forces: incomplete hero, counterpart, complications Examples: Lassie, Lethal Weapon, Rain Man, When Harry Met Sally, Pretty Woman, Titanic, True Lies, Beauty and the Beast. **4. Institutionalized.** A unique group face the pressure and pitfalls of a group dynamic and are given three choices: (1) join (2) revolt or (3) give up. No matter what choice is made, there will be sacrifices and someone will perish. 3 Forces: group, choice, sacrifice Examples: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Godfather, Platoon, Taps, Full Metal Jacket, Dead Poet's Society, Shawshank Redemption, Good Fellas, Office Space. **5. Rites of Passage.** The hero is stuck facing a common life problem that they try to escape from. After a trial by fire of traveling down the wrong road and getting into more trouble, the hero finally gets back on track. The problem can only be transcended once the hero first learns an important life lesson and grows. 3 Forces: life problem, wrong path, acceptance Examples: Lion King, Trainspotting, Ordinary People, Lost in Translation, Risky Business. **6. Superhero.** The hero has superpowers (Superman), mystical powers (Batman) or a compelling mission and opposing forces are equally powerful and determined to thwart the hero. Along with powers, they have a flaw or vulnerability that renders them cursed. 3 Forces: special powers, nemesis, curse Examples: James Bond, Gladiator, Braveheart, Raging Bull, The Matrix, Spider Man. **7. The Fool Triumphant.** As the village oddball, the hero is a misfit (fish out of water)and underdog. Put into challenging circumstances the hero overcomes things in unusual ways to become a true hero, while poking fun at those things we take seriously. 3 Forces: fool, establishment, transmutation Examples: Forest Gump, Crocodile Dundee, Life is Beautiful, Tootsie, Legally Blonde, Pink Panther. **8. Out of the Bottle.** Based in non-reality. The hero makes a wish that comes true, but is afflicted with a spell or curse that leads to more trouble. The hero must change his or her ways to learn a lesson, escape the curse (return to normal) and get the true prize. 3 Forces: wish, spell, lesson Examples: Aladdin, Groundhog Day, Liar Liar, The Mask, Freaky Friday **9. Whodunit.** The hero plays the role of a detective driven to unravel a mystery (Who, What, When, Where and Why). An unexpected secret is revealed and the plot takes a dark turn. Life is radically altered by the outcome. 3 Forces: detective, secret, dark turn Examples: JFK, All the President's Men, Blade Runner, DaVinci Code, Minority Report, Sixth Sense. **10. Monster in the House.** Something terrible is unleashed within a confined space. Someone has sinned, allowing the monster to awaken and do terrible things. 3 Forces: house, monster, sin Examples: Alien, Exorcist, Poltergeist, Psycho, Scream, Fatal Attraction, Jaws, Jurassic Park.

169,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Some Thoughts on the Relationship between Intimacy and Eroticism,31,2urdd7,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2urdd7/some_thoughts_on_the_relationship_between/,2015-02-05 02:12:55,"I recently got my hands on Esther Perel's book ""[Mating in Captivity](URL Although I am also an evangelist of the ""You should never take relationship advice from a woman"" expression, she raises some very interesting points and I thought I should share. As Esther Perel proposes in her book, many people confuse intimacy with eroticism. Whereas intimacy is integrating two into one, eroticism is the separation and connection between the two separate identities. While the level of intimacy is governed by trust, sharing, and security, the level of eroticism is governed by space and power. Intimacy is using the past to accurately predict the future, while eroticism is all about living in the now. Why does it make sense for eroticism to be different from intimacy? This is my conjecture and its only a conjecture. This might be a product of evolutions attempt to balance care-giving and sexual selection. As humans, we need caregiving in our infancy and developmental years more than any other species. This produces a lot of neediness from us on our parents. However, in order to find better mates, we also need to break away from this protective shell and connect with others erotically. The more successful we are in this context (with compatibility and chemistry) is governed by the strength of eroticism, or the desire in the separation. Compatibility and chemistry may as well be a product of the need for genetic variety. If we only wanted to mate with people who are close to us (genetically, which meant also geographically in the past), then we would not obtain the genetic variety required to grow our human brains. While the rest of the animal kingdom adapts to their specific environments (survival of the fittest), humans had to adapt to the changing environments (survival of the smartest). Our human brains vary widely in many types of intelligence required to overcome a variety of environments, physical and social. This range of variety is also expensive to maintain. It needed a constant investment in mating with those who are different than us. It required eroticism. This is how you get the foreigner effect that is deeply erotic. The upshot is that there must be some sort of separation for eroticism to grow, according to Esther Perel. She also mentions that separation is inherently dangerous and vulnerable. So the person who is the most comfortable being vulnerable produces the most erotic feeling. A person who is able to create separation, while also closing the gap, is the most erotically charged. Eroticism is also governed by the power difference between two people. Those who seem to be in control will be erotically attracted to those they control, and vice versa. This is S&amp;M in a nutshell, but it encompasses much more than that. The power play is vulnerability at its core. Those willing to completely surrender to another, or to be deeply vulnerable, must trust the other person to be responsible in some way. This is why eroticism builds on top of intimacy. To circle back on why the embrace of ones own vulnerability tends to allay anxiety and reduce neediness: since neediness is defined as wrong or over-reaction to loss of intimacy, eroticism fills in the void caused by this perceived loss. When one no longer sees space and separation as alarming, but an opportunity for play and arousal, anxiety is converted into flow (more on that later). Aroused by his own vulnerability, the man seeks to take the right course to deal with it. When he erotically charged by showing his vulnerable side, he also arouses the woman that he is vulnerable toward. However this embrace of vulnerability needs to be an emotional one. It maybe also be called a way of life, since being vulnerable requires one to also be more aware, more accepting, more responsible, more assertive, more honest, and more purpose-driven. This might also explain why a confident man is very attractive to women around him."
170,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Tease Your Girl: The Atomic Bomb of Lust,481,2utxph,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2utxph/tease_your_girl_the_atomic_bomb_of_lust/,2015-02-05 14:08:28,"As a follow up to a previous post Ive been asked to author a slightly larger write up by several members pertaining to the teasing of your girl while youre in a relationship. The important point to note is that teasing is relationship-independent. Whether youre known the girl for two hours or two decades, nothing I can imagine will hand you the key to her dripping pussy city faster than a borderline mean bout of teasing coming from a place of light-heartedness, despite the ramblings of tired post-thirty feminists who claim the sexiest thing a man can do is the dishes. *** The game, it should come of no surprise, does not end the minute your belle-du-jour agrees to be monogamous. Teasing-expertise should be the go-to tool strapped to your workbelt of professional pussy carpentry. Our gendered biological past has almost given us a cheat code to female lust. The female Achilles heel is her vulnerability to being teased. There is no woman out there who can resist the mischievous, shit-eating grin of a man who just wont quite take her seriously. The crucial component is to ensure a few key elements. The first is that your teasing is coming from a place of fun and light-heartedness and is not clouded by true meanspiritedness as a form of revenge or bullying. It is invariably very easy for men and women to pick up on this form of mean teasing  imagine the guy trying to talk shit with his boys when he just hasnt earned it yet: it feels uncomfortable and inevitably falls flat. The second crucial point is to ensure your teasing does not collapse into an emphasis on cuteness, tickling and funny voices that is often conflated with a couples inside jokes. Youre aiming to be the affectionate bully, not the touchy friend. Too much familiarity in a tease and youre just earned yourself a ticket to the comfortable but lust-free sweatpants and a messy bun by 9pm. If youre lost in what I mean here, imagine a 6-year-old boy teasing a girl in his class. He's mean, undoubtedly, as a function of not knowing better yet, but fun loving at the same time as a function of his youth. If you can maintain a relationship dynamic in that manner you're on a long path to enjoy the unending rains of the pussy fountain. *** Theres likely some psychology behind this all, but its ultimately of little matter. Exciting men tease, and theyre subtly signaling to their partner that they truly do not fear her disapproval. Some of the meanest things I have done to my woman would cause violence if done to a stranger, but with her provides direct access to her pleasure bean. Completely screwing with her expectations is the root of teasing your girl and should be the fundamental tenet when you plan your simple fun. If your girl isnt faux-angry and punching you on the arm at least once every other day youre failing yourself as the deserving male in the relationship. My favourites, as noted above, always include the complete redirect of her expectations. Some of the best include randomly shutting the lights off on my girl while she's applying make up, spanking ass in any and every opportunity, grabbing her triceps after a gym trip and then making a pouty face, replacing the make up in her cosmetics bag with crayons, slipping her car into neutral at a stop sign then asking if she broke it again, and if she asks for a refill while spread across the couch, go to fill it up then proudly present her with a nearly empty glass. *** Teasing is easy and a genuine contribution to your relationship, betraying a take-it-or-leave-it attitude woman really cannot resist. As a corollary to the above point: if your woman is not responding to your teasing on a consistent basis, you have problems a sprinkling of simple fun cannot bandage over. And lastly, theres a time and a place. Heading to a funeral? Smarten up, bud."
171,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Don't Be Mr. Technical. Understand and Apply Blunt Force Game.,310,2vd8tr,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2vd8tr/dont_be_mr_technical_understand_and_apply_blunt/,2015-02-10 12:28:01,"Today I want to talk about game, and why you're probably missing 50% of it. If that sounds too PUAy for your taste then I advise you to exit this thread now. Specifically, I want to address the lesser know side of game that I dub ""Blunt Force Game"". A little while back I realized too many people who want to improve their game and general sexual success fall into the ""Mr. Technical Trap"". Heres what it is, why it happens, common side effects of it and how you can understand and avoid it to improve your game. (Long fucking post, grab some caffeine and strap in boys, youll be clapping later.) Many people who want to learn sexual strategy seek out simple reproducible techniques that will improve their game (think Benjamin Franklin effect, eye contact, body language, passing shit tests, holding frame, agree and amplify, etc.) and this is all well and good to an extent but because these techniques are relatively easy to explain and implement it skews the discussion on how to build your game disproportionately towards techniques. Furthermore it gives men the idea that socializing and picking up women is a ""technical thing""; aka there has to be some amount of theory, deliberate thought or calculated effort behind your behavior so that it comes out in a socially savvy and effective way.This is a HUGE PITFALL. This will manifest in some level of social/performance anxiety, where on the low end you see picking up chicks as somewhat of a chore or unsettling at times when things aren't going your way or on the high end, full blown social/performance anxiety where all social and sexual interactions feel like a test of your ability and are essentially draining and shitty. I know a good bit of you can relate. I used to have low level social anxiety along with a little performance anxiety for a couple years until I started to honestly ask why I was getting anxious in social and sexual encounters, what circumstances would increase or decrease it, etc.. So how did I come to have this frame shift of seeing socializing and picking up women as this ""technical"" thing to now something else? It actually came out of my MMA class strangely enough (humor my story you ADD bastards). See I train brazilian jiu jitsu which to anyone who knows bjj or the bjj scene knows it has a hard-on for technique. It is super technique based to the point where if a big guy is sparring with a small guy and the big guy just powers through the little dudes defense instead of using technique, he is looked down upon, seen as not doing things in *the spirit* of jiu jitsu. I think there are a lot of people here that think like that. They see that guy down at the bar that maybe got a little drunk, is a bit loud and rambunctious and yet still getting girls and think ""WTF? fuck that guy. That's not technical, thats just belligerent, how can these idiots find him charming, I bet he doesnt even read the 5 red pill and pick up blogs that I do."". I'm not saying everyone here feels that way or that strongly but I think that sentiment is present in a significant few, especially newbies and people involved in the Machiavellian skill circle jerk (sorry bros, I love you too). But back to MMA, when it comes to fighting I am a classic Mr. Technical because of my bjj background, and when I started learning Wrestling at my MMA gym I ran face first into the problem of having an overly technical mindset. I would try to do a wrestling take down but I was too focused on going slow and making sure my angles and foot placement was perfect to the point where I couldnt do the take down on a resisting partner. One of the high level wrestling guys at my gym just flat out told me ""use more force, wrestling is more like a blunt object to the head than jiu jitsu."" Later on it hit me. That loud rambunctious guy down at the bar is just using blunt social force to get success, which many people who study this shit either dont seem to get, or have a distaste for. But if i can liken socializing and fucking women to fighting then ideally, we as Red Pill Men want to create a fully developed and well rounded ""game"". One in which we know how and when to use techniques to our advantage and also a game that includes blunt force blows to some bitches head. (read: belligerent IDGAF alpha game). You have to know when to be the sword master and when to be the drunken brawler. Take what is useful from both and blend the styles, dont allow technique to restrict you ala Bruce Lee. The hard thing about blunt force game is that it is difficult to discuss or explain exactly because it is not technical. From another light you could see it as so simple that its laughable youd have to explain it anyways. So what is it? In my opinion it is **knowing what your character is as a person and in a one size fits all way applying it to social interactions.** (I know that probably sounds stupid but really think about what that sentence means because there is some sexual/social wisdom there.) Its the age old ""be yourself"" mantra that naturals so enjoy saying to the newbie looking to learn success with women. People use words like ""vulnerability"" to describe this concept and it never jived with me because I always saw this as somewhat the opposite. Before you can be yourself you must know yourself (to some degree), then blunt force game is to simply ""Project"" yourself or your personality onto the interaction as a display of power and influence. I picture it as I am like a entity with certain personality traits and likes and dislikes and I sort of pump that entity up and then push it out onto the girl (or guy for socializing). Its what you think of when you see an ""Outgoing"" person. Their personality literally is getting pushed out onto their interactions. Too many dudes try to over-think socializing or pick up because the only thing they ""put out"" onto the interaction is technique or what they've read about online. The safe stuff, what they know will work. Anyways you guys should get the point now. Understand that Blunt Force Game is difficult to talk about because it is so basic and non technical that any explanation seems superfluous but all the same I encourage a discussion in this thread about it. I'd like to hear your thoughts on it as well as how you'd verbalize it if you're trying to explain it to a friend. And I can already hear some of you guys saying ""So your just rewording the concept of holding frame. Nice job buddy..."" but its much bigger than that. It is being able to put your personality out onto others without having to overtly think about it. Holding frame is when someone comes in and tries to poke a hole in your frame or personality and then you just hold it indifferently. They are related but this is more like the concept of becoming extroverted or a natural alpha. Blunt force game is more like something you allow yourself to do than something you deliberately execute. This is why it works too: it displays you're comfortable with yourself because you're ""putting yourself out there"". It displays entitlement because you're not changing your approach to pander to your audience. It builds trust because you are honestly expressing who you are as a person. And it shows dominance because you are projecting your likes and dislikes onto the interaction with the subtext being your preferences come first, and these people can either step in line or get moving. This post has errors and is probably too long and a bit self indulgent but frankly I don't give a fuck, extract the greatness in it and deal with its weakness. TL;DR: There are two sides of game, the often discussed technical game and the lesser known blunt force game. Your blunt force game is probably lagging. You should develop it. "
172,vulnerability,TheRedPill,"[GAME] Chateau Hertiste's ""The Difficulty of Gaming Women by Age""",184,2x77az,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2x77az/game_chateau_hertistes_the_difficulty_of_gaming/,2015-02-26 15:42:23,"A recent post from /u/flexiblehold in response to one of my other comments got me thinking about a post I read a long time ago on CH, that I doubt most of the newbies here today would have read in their traverses in the Manosphere. Mainly, because it was written back in 2010, and the majority of our almost 99,000 users only found TRP in the last 12 months. I won't link his original comment because that's breaking TRP, but in summary he related a story about a 34 year old woman who basically fell into his arms at a bar one night, even though he admits to emanating beta qualities. It was a confounding experience, he almost left her at the bar, and it took an older, wiser, more sage man to basically throw him back onto her pussy. And again, it instantly reminded me of this article. I figured that since there hasn't been much Game discussion since the mods folded it back into TRP, I'd go ahead and post/link it below, as it offers a great wealth of information on how to Game women in different age brackets. For instance, his notion that women age 18-21 NEVER ""Date"" women age 18-21 ""Hang Out"", and that you never use the word ""date"" when gaming those girls, is Game gold. Find it and more gems of wisdom below, enjoy and discuss. URL **The Difficulty of Gaming Women by Age** The following observations apply to established adult men, post college years. Younger men still in college will find their success rate with women of various ages, particularly older women (aka cougars), highly variable. The rules for them will be different than the rules for older men. **18 to 22 year olds** Hard to believe, but it is often easier to bed a very young woman than an older woman, if you are an older man. This is because 20-40% of women are specifically attracted to older men. It is hard-wired in them, and this hard-wiring can be reinforced by poor family upbringing resulting from divorce of parents or absentee fathers. Single moms are the greatest source of future generations of slutty daughters the world has ever known. Your goal is to identify which 18-21 year olds are amenable to being seduced by you. Since a majority will balk at the idea, you should learn to quickly identify and NEXT! them. Thankfully, most girls arent brazen cockteases, and will make their lack of interest known early on. Beware, though, that a small minority of barely legal rapacious golddiggers will try to keep you on tenterhooks, extracting your resources for little in return. A simple preemptive qualification should suffice to smoke them out. You can bang an 18-21 year old surprisingly quickly because they have little ASD (anti-slut defense). This is because they do not have the long history of sluttiness common to older women which needs to be rationalized away by posturing as a paragon of chaste virtue. A young woman simply wont perceive sex with you as an admission of sluttiness. She is innocent to herself as well as to you. Plus, actual slutty behavior has been defined down so that five partners today is equivalent to one partner thirty years ago. Caveat to the above: although you can get the bang with an 18-21 year old very quickly, you should not prime the path to banging with obvious signs of physical escalation. There is a high risk with very young women that escalating kino will be perceived as pervy or creepy. This means no PDA, no innocent touching of her erogenous zones, and no raunchy sex talk. You want to keep it on the superficial friend tip until she is in your place. Then you should escalate rapidly. Youd be amazed how fast the young woman sheds her clothes when the bang is in sight. Very little foreplay is required. The sex will be, as you can imagine, the hottest you will ever have. DO NOT EVER DATE an 18-21 year old. Women under 23 dont date, they hang out. Anything that remotely smacks of a date  drinks at a lounge, dinner for two, day trips to a museum  will scare her off. The under-23 young woman cannot handle the seriousness of a dating context. This is the reality of modern America. Dating makes younger women think no fun, marriage, kids, pressure, relationships, stuff that older people do. You need to be so chill that youre barely motivated to do anything proactive with her. Instead, hang out with her in a neutral context. Walks along window-browsing streets are good for this. So is meeting at a local park and talking while goofing off on the swings. You can take her to a coffee shop as long as you dont buy anything. DONT BE LAME. If a 19 year old (true story) offers you an E tab in a dark corner of a loud club at 1 am, dont refuse her like some boring fuddy duddy. Either pop that baby and enjoy the ride, or pretend to take it and throw it away when shes not looking if youre suspicious of the pills origins and purity. Push for a blowjob in the alley behind the club; plans to make future dates are a fools errand. DONT BE HER DAD. Contrary to popular misconception, most young women dont want to date a father figure. They DO want to date a strong dominant man, and older men bring that demeanor to the table. This is why it is better to dress youthfully (if you are in shape) rather than in a sharp suit and tie if its much younger women you want to meet. A notable minority of younger women love the business suit look, but most of them, especially the ones on the fence about dating older men, would feel more comfortable if you projected an aura of youthfulness through your dress and attitude. **23 to 27 year olds** Similar to the 18-22 year olds in terms of difficulty of picking up, with some important differences. The 23-27 year old feels she is at her attractiveness peak, despite her peak having passed a few years earlier. This is because she is surrounded by many more high status men than she was while in college (or working at the Piggly Wiggly) who are expressing sexual interest in her. This social dynamic will work to inflate her ego beyond the bounds of her actual beauty ranking. Some consequences result from this. NEG HARDER. The 23-27 year old will require harder negging than any other age group of women, even the hotter 18 year olds. She needs her ego punctured before her pussy will open for you. Remember that cherished maxim: Maxim #23: The defensive crouch is where pussy tingles are born. DEFY EXPECTATIONS. She expects you to pay her way and play the role of earnest suitor. You cant hang out with the 23-27 year old like you should with the 18-22 year old without staining yourself with the immaturity label, but you shouldnt fall into her trap of arid, sexless dating either. Arrange dates that are simple and logistically favorable. Never spend more than two drinks worth of money on her on a single date. DATE CONCURRENTLY. The 23-27 is, arguably, the most in-demand woman on the market. Various social factors account for this, which will be the subject of another post. Thus, she will have the greatest self-regard. Despite your best game, you may find yourself getting flaked on by a girl in this age range. A good defense is a solid offense, so minimize the creep of neediness and desperation by dating many women at once. Do not feel guilt about fucking multiple women concurrently. THIS IS YOUR SWEET SPOT FOR GAME. No other woman will react as positively to hardcore game as the 23-27 year old. She and her sisters will be throwing meatballs at the middle of your lineup. Aim for the fences. **28 to 30 year olds** Finally, the female ego suffers chinks in its armor. She will try hard to cover these cracks, but theyll creep out here and there. 30 is a huge and depressing milestone for women, but 29 is an even more depressing birthday. It is the last hurrah, so to speak, and the number taunts her daily with reminders of her impending obsolescence. A single girl who was dumped by her boyfriend and who has just turned 29 may be the easiest girl in the world to lay. You will still need to game her, but the path to sex will be exhilaratingly fast and furious. 28-30 year olds are a mixed bunch. Some are riding a wave of career and social success that has nowhere to go but down, and their bloated egos reflect that. Others, less conventionally successful, are emotionally frazzled by the disappearing act of their heady youth and by the intractability of their singledom. You will find some of the cuntiest, and sweetest, girls in this age range. Same rules as the ones for 23-27 year olds apply to 28-30 year olds, with the exception that negging should be tailored to the life success as well as the looks of the girl you are gaming. A 30 year old businesswoman is often harder to game than a 20 year old hipster. She will need subtle reminders that her beauty isnt what it once was. **31 to 34 year olds** In some ways, women in the 31-34 age range are the toughest broads to game. (By toughest, it is meant most time consuming.) Its counterintuitive, yes, but there are factors at work besides her declining beauty which mitigate against the easy, quick lay. For one, it is obviously harder to meet single 31-34 year old women than it is to meet single younger women. Marriage is still a pussy-limiting force to contend with for the inveterate womanizer, but Chateau apprentices are hard at work battling the scourge of mating market disturbances caused by the grinding and churning of the marriage machine. But the bigger reason 31-34 year olds are harder to game than any other age group of women has to do with the wicked nexus of entitlement and self-preservation that occurs at this age in women. When you combine a disproportionate sense of entitlement fueled by years of feminism, steady paychecks and promotions, and cheerleading gay boyfriends with suspicions of every mans motives and a terrible anxiety of being used for a sexual fling sans marriage proposal, you get a venom-spitting malevolent demoness on guard against anything she might perceive as less than total subjugation to her craving for incessant flattery and princess pedestaling. Note that Chateau guests arent necessarily complaining. A harder-to-game 33 year old is kind of like getting bumped down from a Honda Civic rental but driving off the lot with the consolation prize of a Ferrari. Listen to any man who is good with women and they will tell you the same thing: I have an easier time bedding and dating 23 year olds than I do 33 year olds. This defies all logic until you see it through the eyes of the hamster sweating its fluffy ass off in a womans brain. (Poor little creature must be pooped out by the mid-30s.) Sure, a 33 year old is not as hot as the 23 year old version of herself, but her ASD is through the roof, as is her self-conception as a hot marriage-worthy commodity. Many older women will tell themselves that their experience, maturity, accomplishments and financial stability mean they should be way more valuable to men seeking wives than some young babe on the take. Of course, they have to tell themselves this because reality isnt making it easy to believe. These are the kind of women who have sexual flings with college guys, because they can psychologically box those men in as purely for fun adventures. But the men the 31-34 year old women really want are the older, established men who will give them a marriage proposal and a family. This is why it is counterintuitively harder to game the older woman who still retains a vestige of her youthful attractiveness: she wants and expects so much more than the younger woman. Game required: Strong body language, masculine dominance, sharp suits and shoes, easy on the negs and palm reading, emphasis on the comfort stage, lots of travel stories, disqualify yourself from sex on the first date, vulnerability game, avoidance of the beta provider zone. In short, if you can present yourself to her as different than the indistinguishable mass of sad schlumpy beta herbs who are her typical choice in available men, then you are guaranteed the lay. Just dont expect to sleep with her on the first night. She will work hard to make your seduction as difficult and drawn out as possible. Note: DO NOT SPEAK OF THE YOUNGER WOMEN YOU DATE to an older woman. You will be tempted to do this to demonstrate your higher value, but instead she will withdraw so fast into her ego-preserving turtle shell that no game will redeem the pickup. If the subject comes up, just tell her youve dated many interesting women and leave it at that. **35 year olds** This age gets a special mention. Why? Because 35 is the year of formal female expiration. (Informal expiration can occur many years later, depending on the womans genetic good luck.) At 35, most women are over the hill. An unmarried woman at 35 is officially in crisis mode. Full meltdown will happen within the year if she isnt hitched in that time. You do not want to be in the vicinity of a woman in full meltdown mode. Full meltdown is accompanied by the acquisition of a second cat, alcoholism, cackling brunches of mimosas with equally pathetic Samantha wannabes, sloppy drunken one night stands with college age men which they will then rationalize as evidence of their enduring beauty, and a laundry list of annoying personality tics and neuroses that would comfortably provide for the retirement plans of ten psychotherapists. Game required: Hi. **36 to 38 year olds** She is at peace with her spinsterhood and her failure in the dating market. She will acquiesce easily and gratefully to sex with very little game, as long as you dont look like a grandpa. Her expectations are so low, it will be a challenge to disappoint her. If you are prone to guilt, you might feel it when you inevitably dump a woman in this age range. Dont. Remind yourself that her past is littered with her insouciant dumping of many beta men before you. You are merely an alpha agent of righteous karma. A Chateau proprietor once dated a European 37 year old for a couple of months. She looked years younger than her age, so the sex was fun and the time together was relaxed, but everything was glazed with a tint of sadness. A vow was made never to go much above 30 again. So far, the vow remains unbroken. **39+ year olds** No Chateau proprietor has experience dating or fucking women 39 years old or older, so we cannot offer much advice for gaming women in this age range. Yes, yes, we can all hear you crying now. "
173,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Cruel Awakening,7,2xettk,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2xettk/cruel_awakening/,2015-02-28 11:09:52,"Perhaps I am breaking frame, but I need to get this off my chest... I swallowed the red pill six months ago, and have actively been applying TRP principles in my life. I placed a new-found sense of priority toward myself, began to step up my workout regiment (thus increasing my SMV), and have been making it a point to become as cultured and informed as possible when it comes to the world around us. The lies blue pillers have bought in relation to what is right with women, work, and friends become permanently altered once you swallow the red pill. My perception was no longer jaded by the so-called principles that media, the ongoing feminist movement, and people who keep you in an exploitable position in order to ensure their progress even if it is at your disproportionate and permanent expense. This era of enlightenment has led to successes with women in a way I have not experienced before, also the quality of friends I am now making, as well as people being attracted to me insofar as potentially doing business together and embarking on projects. I am truly gracious to the countless individuals who have generously contributed by way of field reports, theory, and examples; all of which have been instrumental to my progress and growth as a man who now walks with the open eyes and ears only this awesome Red Pill community has been able to offer me with such abundance. That being said, I am realizing that we all have our blind spots. I can hereby confirm that I certainly have mine, and it came to me in the form of who I believed to be a beautiful, charming, and enchanting woman. Perhaps a little bit of background is in order: we met almost a decade ago, and there was an instant attraction to one another both physically and intellectually. We agreed to go on a date, but to my disappointment the timing couldn't have been worse. I learned during the date we had at the restaurant that she had just come out of a LTR only two weeks before, and that both the relationship as well as the break up were very traumatic for her. It was at that point that she began to cry right there at that table, which transformed this otherwise fantastic date minutes before into a full-blown therapy session. Forgive me for sounding crass or insensitive, but I was a little pissed off about how this date I was actually looking forward to became something I did not sign up for. Even my old BP self was wise enough to withdraw and not to exercise any of my prevalent white knight tendencies of that era. Needless to say, the date ended early. She ended up getting back with her cheating ex a few weeks later, and opted to continue accepting what I believed to be a standard that was beneath her. Despite all these hiccups, I couldn't deny the attraction I had toward her. There was always this unquenched curiosity about what might have been had the circumstances been different. As time went on, I eventually succumbed to the high probability that this curiosity within me will be left unfulfilled. We respectfully would exchange messages from time to time, but not enough for either of us to be too current about one another's lives. Now to fast forward to the present: a few weeks ago, she reached out to me and we engaged in that same level of intense conversation we always had. Since she recently moved to another country, we settled to see one another on Skype. As cheesy or unbelievable as this will sound, I sincerely prefer her presence (even if only over a monitor) to the pillow friends (my polite way of referring to a FWB) I readily have at my disposal. It didn't take long before she brought up the date we had years ago, she even apologized for the circumstances of the time, commented on how she found me handsome and charming both then and now, and that she certainly wanted to know me more. She mentioned that she had not been in a relationship for about six years, but that she had met her share of men who it didn't end up working out with. This relieved me because I wasn't going to inherit the rebound status I accidentally walked into in the past. Hours always felt like minutes when we spoke, and she had a magical way of monopolizing my attention. It has become rather foreign and unusual for me to actually feel this intense for a woman, so I felt that she was somebody I definitely wanted to have more of. Everyone who knows me knows that I do not do exclusivity with any woman, but I found myself compelled to make this unprecedented exception when it came to her. I stepped up and told her that I want more of her. The feeling was mutual, so we agreed to not see other people and to take the time needed to discover whether we truly have something worth making official. Without hesitation or regret, I actively made clear to my FWB that the intimacy we shared is over and that I needed to follow my heart. This time around, things started off great. At first, she made every effort to communicate with me in whatever pocket of time she can create, even if only to wish me good morning or to send me a flirtatious message. She felt strong enough for me that she didn't take very long to mention my existence to her family and friends. We agreed that it is crucial we see each other in person, and I seriously began planning my trip to visit her. About a week ago, she messages to inform me that she had lost a job. That is when she suddenly changed toward me. Don't get me wrong, I totally understand that losing a job is devastating, and I did everything I humanly can to be supportive in whichever way possible. She was instantly able to replace this job with two new and more exciting opportunities, so the financial impact was minimal if any. I suppose this temporary window of vulnerability and being thrown off balance led her to begin retelling me the traumatic experiences of what I thought were a more distant past. It is then that I learned how the most recent encounter was not brief at all, but lasted well over a year. What's more is that she blurts out how she is still crushed over the situation, and that all of this only came to an end less than a month ago! Now that is not someone who has been single for over six years, nor someone who is ready to pursue what's between us as she claims if you ask me. This was a boyfriend, and yet again, I was a rebound! When I asked why this wasn't made clearer to me, she had the audacity to tell me that it is because I never asked! First of all, would this line of questioning occur to you if the person clearly stated that they had been single for over six years? Second, is asking about the intimate details of past encounters a new protocol or standard practice I am simply not up to date with? I expressed that I felt misled and was completely disappointed that I am made to feel that I inherited a different manifestation of the same shitty rebound situation. Twice! It is then that she told me that she needs to go, and I have not heard from her regularly since. I have been given the silent treatment, the very one she claims to be a form of torture when she experienced it from her ex years ago. The very one she pleaded with me never to subject her to if ever there is an issue between us to work out. When I foolishly gave in and messaged her, she began proclaiming how she is too tired to speak with me, that I do not understand her circumstances, that I am asking for too much from her, and that I am not respecting her boundaries! The last accusation almost set me into hamster mode, but I did my best to hold frame and was almost pushed to break it once she attempted to depict me as someone invasive and too needy! I have never been either of the above! As for now, I am unsure of whether I should reach her and say my peace or go silent and revert to my more familiar self. What I do know is that I am honestly hurt and disappointed. I was deceived, and I am upset at myself for falling for all this. To sum it up, I was duped and cruelly misled! I was better treating women the way I have been. But whatever! That's just befitting since I was foolish enough to begin believing that I have come across my unicorn, and boy did that stupid idea get taken from me quick! As I get older, I have begun to understand Iraq's need for a Saddam more and more. Some people can only be ruled with an iron fist. Never show vulnerability, especially to a woman!They are not the gentle and loving creatures like that lie popular culture and media has sold us for so god damn long! They are hypergamous and opportunists. The ends always justify the means to them, no matter what it causes other. They have no scruples with using whatever asset they have to get whatever they want. They have no shame in shaking their moneymaker or in telling lies if it gets them what they want. As for me, I will never fall off course like this again! RANT DONE! "
174,vulnerability,TheRedPill,"Thoughts on SMV, Frame, and a Framework for the So-Called ""Alpha Mood"" (Tl;dr included)",118,2r3lku,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2r3lku/thoughts_on_smv_frame_and_a_framework_for_the/,2015-01-03 00:46:44,"In the TRP Framework, if only two things will remain that man can tweak to influence the quality of his life, it will probably be his SMV and his Frame Control. This is because both SMV and Frame are with a man from his day of birth down to his last breath. A male infant's SMV is virtually zero and will fluctuate to varying levels of highs and lows as he goes through life, with the highest highs and lowest low being determinable only more or less on the day of his death. As for a child, the Frame Control starts probably at an absolute 100% because his mind only works to ensure one thing: survival. And I must add, I think it is not because of the infant's extreme selfishness, but because of his brain's extreme single-mindedness in the life-and-death task of survival and so it does with all it's power all that it could to survive: cry. Until we have gained methods to get inside the consciousness of a child and witness it in a first person point of view, we will presume that the his attempts to control the Frame are purely out of instinct. Now this infant's frame control very quickly goes to the lower 90% as he becomes attuned to his parents mood and approval, and then far lower, as his parent's influence on his Frame deepen and more outside factors gain influence that are probably deeper than that of the parent's (e.g. a pre-school teacher, an older brother, peers, a girl, a crush, a oneitis, other components of the society such as social media and government, etc.) **Revisiting Definitions of SMV and Frame** Before we are able to dig deeper on this discussion, let's first review what SMV and Frame are. According to [u/IllimitableMan](URL on [his post on Sexual Market Value](URL it is &gt; SMV is known as social market value or more commonly, sexual market value. It is the inherent value of a person, the crude 1-10 rating of where a person is in the social hierarchy. According to his writings, a man's SMV has two aspects: perceived and actual. Perceived SMV is &gt; ... what people (including yourself) believe your SMV to be based upon their personal interactions with you (And with yourself, your own self-esteem and sense of validation), this is the illusory factor, the glazing to the substance of who you are and what youre worth, these are things such as how you behave and how you carry yourself (carrying yourself as a concept is basically demeanour and self-control combined into one) perceptive social market value can lead people to think youre a few points higher or a few points lower down the scale than you really are. Actual SMV &gt; ... consists of tangible things that cannot be refuted such as your conventional physical attractiveness, your financial wealth and skill sets you possess (such as languages spoken, instruments played, martial arts known etc.)... If what you have or can do is in demand or coveted as desirable by others, then it is inherently a high value possession or trait. If the element in question is not in demand or coveted then it does nothing for your value in wider society. As for what Frame is, we will revisit Mr. [Rollo Tomassi](URL [Iron Rule of Tomassi #1](URL &gt; ... frame is an often subconscious, mutually acknowledged personal narrative under which auspices people will be influenced. Ones capacity for personal decisions, choices for well-being, emotional investments, religious beliefs and political persuasions (amongst many others) are all influenced and biased by the psychological narrative framework under which we are most apt to accept as normalcy. Mr. Tomassi went on to state, &gt; One important fact to consider, before I launch into too much detail, is to understand that frame is NOT power. The act of controlling the frame may be an exercise in power for some, but let me be clear from the start that the concept of frame is whos reality in which you choose to operate in relation to a woman. By looking again at the definition of Frame as written by [u/Rollo-Tomassi](URL and the concept of SMV as written by [u/IllimitableMan](URL we will find that a common ground can be found at the Perceived SMV because Perceived SMV is, in a manner of speaking, the *Framed* SMV. This begs the question: How do we control the *Frame* of our Perceived SMV? **A Proposed Answer: A Framework for the So-Called ""Alpha Mood""** Studying the writings of [Rollo Tomassi](URL and [Illimitable Man](URL gave us light on how two of the things -- SMV and Frame -- that we can modify to influence the quality of our lives can interact together, which then led to the question of how we can Frame our Perceived SMV. In fact, not only did Illimitable Man and Rollo Tomassi provide the premise of the main question, but also the answers can be found on the writings of the same thinkers (and for all we know, doers), with the addition of another writer and thinker, Robert Greene. For our discussion, we will start with the writing of the last author introduced in this post. &gt; Emotional states are as infectious as diseases. (Law 10. Infection: Avoid the Unhappy and Unlucky. The 48 Laws of Power.) &gt; We are all susceptible to the emotions of those around us. It is often hard for us to perceive how deeply we are affected by the moods that can pass through a group. (Strategy 33. The Chain-Reaction Strategy. The 33 Strategies of War.) &gt; If we believe we are destined for great things, our belief will radiate outward... This outward radiance will infect the people around us, who will think we must have reasons to feel so confident. (Strategy of the Crown, Law 34. Be Royal in Your Own Fashion: Act Like a King to be Treated Like One. The 48 Laws of Power.) Now that we have a rough presentation of the answer, all we have to do now is to start by asking the next question: What kind of emotions should most of the time? Let's first turn to Illimitable Man's [post](URL &gt; Happy Wife, Happy Life has got to be the most idiotic misguided figure of speech to have ever been immortalised in the memetics of the societal consciousness. Happiness flows downwards, not upwards. In order for her to be happy, it is you, the man, who must be happy first and foremost. If you are not happy, you will struggle to make her happy. This means even in sacrifice, for her, or what you consider to be the greater good of the relationship, you must be enthusiastic. You cannot be begrudgingly forced to sacrifice by the parameters set out by the social contract. Your sacrifice for the significant woman in your life must come from a place of altruism and therefore be consensual rather than mandated by law or convention. You see it is laborious sacrifice stemming from obligation rather than love which leads to the growth of contemptuous discontent for your woman. Does this mean that you always have to be that wide-eyed, smiling ear-to-ear, ball of positive energy that is commonly associated with happiness? That is up to you. Act like a king to be treated like one. In Robert Greene's 48LoP, Louise-Philippe tried to consciously banish the aura that naturally pertained to kings and leaders. He further asserted that those who try to dissolve that distance through a *false* chumminess gradually lose their ability to inspire loyalty, fear, and love. Instead they only inspire contempt so low that they're not worthy of hatred; they just banish from people's attention. Whatever this happy disposition that you have come up with that is fit for a king is a disposition that we take as a passive stance, appropriate for a time of relative peace and stability. But what about in times of extraordinary circumstances, say, an impending crisis or stressful times? And as we all know, it is the height of naivete to believe that we can feel unstoppable in the face of a colossal challenge (never mind the shit test, think about the risk of losing your job because an unknown colleague is framed you), or worse, when failure has finally befallen us. Let us now turn to Rollo Tomassi on [this post](URL &gt; Youre a man, suck it up, you shouldnt be vulnerable by virtue of your maleness. Its a conflicting message in light of the touchy-feely feminine conditioning men endure in their upbringing, but it is an honest reaction, and one that men need to understand when sorting out the reality of women and their need to unplug. This is the active stance. It is suggested that we try to suck our ~ahem~ feelings up as much as we could. We shouldn't let vulnerability slip past our defenses or else we might lose our women, friends, and much worse, our selves and our rationality by letting ourselves be driven by our feelings. If that sounds very girly, that's why. How do the passive stance and active stance work in Framing our Perceived SMV? Simple. Let's go back again to Robert Greene's discussion on the Strategy of the Crown. &gt; This outward radiance will infect the people around us, who will think we must have reasons to *feel* so confident. On the active stance, when you don't whine, when you don't cry, when you suck it up, ~~girls~~ people will think you still have something up your sleeve and that is how your Perceived SMV is increased. In fact, when you don't let your emotions overcome you, you will be able to analyze things with a more dispassionate eye, and devise and execution a strategy of amoral efficiency. On the passive stance, when you are passively happy based on your standard of what represents strength and/or majesty, you give the impression that you are strong, skilled, and worthy of respect, loyalty, fear, and love, and lots of sex. Bonus: Emotions are not only affecting our Perceived SMV and Frame, it might also affect our Actual SMV if we think about a line from Robert Greene's Mastery: &gt; This is The Primary Law of the Creative Dynamic that you must engrave deeply in your mind and never forget: your emotional commitment to what you are doing will be translated directly into your work. If you go at your work with half a heart, it will show in the lackluster results and in the laggard way in which you reach the end. If you are doing something primarily for money and without a real emotional commitment, it will translate into something that lacks a soul and that has no connection to you. You may not see this, but you can be sure that the public will feel it and that they will receive your work in the same lackluster spirit it was created in. If you are excited and obsessive in the hunt, it will show in the details. If your work comes from a place deep within, its authenticity will be communicated. &gt; The truth is that creative activity is one that involves the entire self - our *emotions*, our levels of energy, our characters, and our minds. **Tl;dr**: Frame (with ourselves and in relation to other people) and our Perceived SMV are affected by our emotions. The prescribed passive emotional state is happiness coming from a place of strength (or desiring it) and personal majesty (respect). For active times, such as in times of turmoil, suck the emotions up as much as possible. Difficult indeed, but the opposite is -ahem- girly and detrimental to our rationality."
175,vulnerability,TheRedPill,Who posted this on using emotion and emotional variation in LTR's?,1,2r8o5w,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2r8o5w/who_posted_this_on_using_emotion_and_emotional/,2015-01-04 09:02:30,"Who posted this kick ass analysis on using emotion and emotional variation in LTR's? I need this for a footnote in a book I am writing. Although I heavily edited it, the author should be cited. It was around November 2014? I cut and pasted it but didn't get the Poster's handle. BPP ......Edit..Reformatted by request..... **NOTE: ALL THIS IS CUT/PASTE FROM THE UNKNOWN GUYS POST** ""He just makes me feel so good (emotion). It's like I don't understand why I like him (logic), but I do. It's not that he's not good for me (logic), but he makes me feel so good that everything else about him doesn't matter (emotion)."" As she said this I started digging deeper. I could feel my whole opinion of dating and relationships changing by the second. Excitedly I asked, ""What does he make you feel specifically? Describe it to me."" After a pause she said, ""Everything."" This lunch as a young man at college started my path towards understanding why you need more emotion and less logic in your interactions with women, especially in an LTR. I've since talked to friends and family about their ""successful"" relationships, and how the guy made the girl ""FEEL"" something. He didn't make her ""THINK"" something. Quick example. Let's think of the common complaints women have about marriages. (I have four older sisters so this one is easy for me) -Boring -Dull -Emotionless -Lost its spark (emotion) Why do women love movies where the married woman cheats? Because there is an excess of emotion and passion in her newfound romance that isn't found in her marriage. Think of American Beauty for a second (best movie for understanding relationships that I can think of). The wife and husband have the dullest relationship in the world. There is no emotion, no excitement, no variety to speak of, and because of that their relationship fell to shit. Now consider the exact opposite type of relationship. Imagine someone who keeps their relationship charged with different emotions. -Sad -Angry -Happy -Intriguing -Passionate -Joyful -Relaxed -Calm -Spontaneous This relationship is exciting! It is shifting all the time. The girl feels things in new ways. You're helping her to enjoy her ride through life, and if you do this with your wife she will love you and ultimately become addicted to you. Let me get back to my friend now. After talking with her about all the emotions he made her feel I asked if she would want to bring him over to a friends art show. She said they would love to. I then observed. While watching him it all started to click for me. This guy was a natural at helping women to feel. Here's the different ways I saw that guy take this girl on an emotional journey in 10 minutes. Emotions that she feels will be in parentheses. Minute 1: Walk into the party. Both of them don't know anyone, and immediately he makes a stride to introduce himself to me (CONFIDENT) and proceeds to talk with me about the art and insight behind the art (INTELLIGENCE &amp; INTRIGUE). She's intrigued and says to him, ""You know about art?"" (AWE) Minute 2-3: They are walking around looking at the art. He's escorting her with his arm on her back (SAFE/SECURE) and talking about the art (MORE AWE) Minute 4-5: She drops something. Immediately he teases her (Embarrassed), and then comes back with another joke that takes her embarrassment away (Jubilant). He continues to tease and joke around with her before turning his back on her and walking away (Sad) Minute 6: She's trying to play hard to get but I can tell she wants to go back over to him (Unsure/Anxious) and stand near him again where she knows that she'll feel (Safe). Minute 7-9: He smiles and winks at her once while talking to my art friend (Desire) Minute 10: He walks back over to her, whispers something into her ear, and she grabs his suit coat---then he walks away to go somewhere----she's got the bedroom eyes. (Passion &amp; Desire) Some might say that looking at this much detail overkill; however, I strongly disagree. Watching my friend progress through the course of 10 minutes shows me that this guy would trigger her emotions (knowingly or unknowingly) and because of that she was addicted to him, and wanted to jump his bones at the end of the night. Through their 10 minute interaction she felt everything. She's constantly on the edge of her seat wondering what he is going to do next. AND SHE LOVES IT. With any girl that you meet they love feeling things. They love feeling certain emotions. It's your job to encourage that emotion in your GF in a healthy way. Tease her, and then cuddle her. Pin her on the bed and kiss her before walking away. When you introduce emotion into the relationship shell love you for it. Shell laugh harder than ever before. Shell treat you well more than ever before. This is just because you help her to feel things that are new, intriguing, and surprising. Now that weve got the theoretical explanation out of the way, Ill nail down 5 ways to introduce emotion into your relationships. **Tell Good Stories** When I say good stories I mean stories that have multiple emotions. For example, I tell a story of how I got into composing music. How initially I just did classical music, and the world bored me. Playing the notes of someone else felt like something was missing. I then go into the vulnerability and anger I had when I played my first composition for someone, and how they hated it. Finally, I finish by stating that the hard work and drive paid off, and that Ive felt redeemed through my current work. This story has multiple emotions in its longer form. Its sad, happy, funny, confident, and more. These are the kinds of stories you need to learn to tell, and tell yourself. If you don't know how to tell stories. Learn. Watch comedians, listen to famous story tellers, and emulate the things they do to make their stories exciting. **Have fun** This is not stated enough. Tickle her if you want to. Pick her up and throw her on the bed, and laugh. Snort like a pig while youre having sex. My friend calls this the idea of laughing inside your own head. Do things that you think are funny, even if she wont agree. Do things that make you laugh inside your own head. Doing these things increases your dont give a fuck attitude, and helps you to carry positive emotions through the night. **Tease her. Tease her. Tease her.** This is emotional gold. People still dont do this enough. I call my girlfriend a witch when shes overacting, or testing my boundaries. I look at her with inquisitive eyes and say, Burn the witch at the stake for her wrongdoings! Grab the pitchforks! You know how girls have that line of things that are acceptable for teasing, and arent. Straddle the line. Have fun with it. Girls dont enjoy being teased by someone they dont like, but they LOVE being teased by guys they do like. Keep that in mind. Banter and teasing keeps the spark that most people feel is missing from a relationship. **Quick emotional switch** This one is a little more difficult to get used to, but when used effectively it will make your GF turned on, incredibly happy, or a nice mix of the two. You want to push one emotion, and then quickly switch it to another emotion. For example, say youre teasing her, and the emotion in the room is happy and jubilant, quickly switch into a serious state of mind. Change your vocal tone to an incredibly tender and slow pace, take your body language into a state of relaxed nature, and then calm her down and say that youre just thinking of something incredibly sad. Say that something reminded you of the day your dog died. Etc. It may seem strange. But it works. This is why angry sex is a thing. The emotions quickly switch in a girls head and she gets incredibly turned on, even though shes angry (I dont advocate for angry sex as it leads to the wrong emotional environment around sex at least in my opinion). However, I do something similar in strange ways. Ill tell my GF shes the worst person in the world and shes pulling tricks on me (jokingly) as I press my body against her, and turn her on. These emotional switches work incredibly well. It probably needs a whole post on its own. Just know this. If you can quickly switch or mess with a girls emotions in quick succession, shell be addicted to you. Most of my foreplay is done with emotions for 10-15 minutes before sex. I turn her on mentally, and then she cant wait to have sex with me. **Dont show weak emotions, and dont be afraid to show strong emotions.** Weak emotions to me are the emotions like sadness, insecurity, loneliness, etc Strong emotions are emotions like anger, drive, and determination. IM NOT ADVOCATING SHOWING ANGER AT YOUR GIRL. IM ADVOCATING THAT IF YOU DON'T LIKE HER BEHAVIOR, THAT YOU SHOULDNT BE AFRAID TO TELL HER AND DISPLAY YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT. ABUSE IN ANY FORM IS WRONG, IMMORAL AND INSECURE. Now that Ive got that out of the way, a good example would be if a girl forgets something that is meaningful to you. Tell her that youre upset that she didnt remember, and that you expect more out of her. Let a little bit of DISAPPOINTMENT creep into what you say (but remember to say it extremely slow and calmly) and shell apologize profusely. Again. Tell her to be better next time. You know what? Shell be better next time. When a girl sees how strong you are with certain emotions shell do anything she can to feel your validation, and emotional strength and security. IMPORTANT SIDE NOTES -Dont be the over emotional guy. Im telling you to learn and understand emotion, not live it. Its up to you to be in charge of the emotion, not living it. Its your job to be an emotional rock that can manipulate it as you will, but dont get sucked into it like she does. -Watch movies and just analyze the way different emotions are portrayed. Analyze different vocal tonalities and rhythms in speaking, analyze how that displays various emotions. Analyze the body language of different emotions. Get to the point where you can look at girls and know their emotion. -Experiment with changing girls emotions. Test different things that trigger emotions on girls, and see what works for you. Find new ways to quickly switch her emotions on and turn her on. Each girl is different, but some things will work for you, and you can be happy knowing youve figured how to work emotion through yourself. -Manipulating a girl to do exactly what you want at any time is completely possible. However, it isnt moral! Dont use emotion to selfish ends. Its possible, but instead move her emotions so that she is happier, rather than so youre selfishly happier. Trust me. Emotional abuse is a real thing, and isnt right. I get that all of this is kind of confusing and theoretical, but trust me. Analyzing and understanding emotion may be the best thing you do for your LTRs. Ask if you have any applied questions, or general questions about the information above. "

I slept with a whole bunch of girls (entirely thanks to TRP) over the summer, but I felt pretty damn good about this one, so I agreed to be exclusive with her two months ago. Before, I hadn't done much reading on TRP in relation to LTRs, but now I see that the game doesn't change. You can't rest on your laurels and become beta in any way even with a super committed girl, because she'll smell your bullshit from 100 miles away, and she'll immediately start pulling away because you're less attractive to her all of a sudden. This girl and I have been extremely sexual with each other so far. Dirty texts all day, and great, consistent sex every time we see each other. She started to really latch on, which I didn't mind. However, once I started giving into her neediness, I sensed an immediate paradigm shift in how she's acting. Recently, I canceled a couple of my plans to hang out with her instead. I also let my guard down once to tell her about something that was making me mad (showing vulnerability), and I can tell she's gotten colder. She doesn't care about my problems, and she doesn't want to know I have them. It dried her up SO fast. The sexual texts stopped, and I'm suddenly carrying the majority of the momentum in this thing. I thought she would appreciate me showing vulnerability, but I was wrong. Women just want you to be a strong, unwavering badass at all times. Vulnerability makes them want to puke. I'm not extremely worried about it, because I'll just go back to treating her the way I did when I was giving her tingles, and she'll warm back up. So the moral of the story is that I can't let down my guard even though we're in a committed relationship. I know this is what all TRP reading says, but I just needed to get my thoughts out and organize them so I can address this thing as effectively as possible. If you have any tips for me, please send them over. TRP has gotten me **really** far in life over the last 2 years, so I'm more than willing to continue to follow it now."

I want to keep this anonymous. &gt; Ann and I have been married for 9 months, we've been together for 3 years. Our relationship has been pretty smooth, and I love her to bits. However, we have a big personality clash. We've lived with it in the past but its affected her more than it has affected me. I'm more of a 'keep it all in' guy and I prefer to deal with my issues by myself. She on the other hand, talks about her issues with me, and we work through them together. I've always been a little ""cold"", maybe steely is a better word. I'm not too emotional, not that its a good or bad thing, its just the way I am. &gt; My wife and I were forced to put down our dog recently. He was my dog before we met but he became a big part of our family. She loved the hell out of that dog, and I did too. When I lived abroad for a year, he kept her company and she was very close to him. So, we came back from the vet, and she was crying all the way. I was feeling really sad but I wasn't really showing it. She asked why I wasn't feeling sad, I told her I was. She started screaming at me for not having feelings, me being inhuman, me being cold, and her being scared of me for that. I told her that I cannot force myself to cry and I was feeling terrible inside. &gt; We get home and she went off about I'm barely human and I'm basically an automaton. She then went on and on about how she has never seen me cry. Not when we had broken up 1 and a half years into our relationship, not when my mother died, not when I was leaving for a year to work abroad. I told her that me crying doesn't solve anything and she should quit bothering me. I went to bed. &gt; Next morning, I wake up and decide to edit some videos I wanted to upload. I work from home and I have one main computer to work from. It has 3 hard drives. The first one is my OS drive the other two have recordings on them. I wake up to find the other two completely wiped. I freak out and irrationally think that it might have been some software or something. I try and see what the cause was, and I can't figure out anything. I had put in so much work recording these videos, so much effort had gone into them. I broke down. I had backed up only the recordings from 2 months ago. I'm sobbing hard and I just feel pathetic. I'd lost so much of my work and I couldn't figure out how. My wife then comes in, sees me. I tell her what happened. She tells me she did it. She wanted to see me cry and didn't know how else to make it happen. She's is happy she got to see that some part of me is human. She tells me it was healthy for me to let my emotions out. I swear to God, that's the first time I have ever wanted to hit her. I would have strangled her. I packed up a few things, laptop, phone, got in the car and told her that I'll call her when I am ready. I'm staying with a buddy of mine right now. And I need to figure this shit out. She was all apologetic and loving when I was leaving and was acting confused. I feel nothing but hatred towards her right now, but I need to be tactful in handling this situation right now. Help me figure it out ? On the update, the wife said that she always felt that she's the weaker one in the relationship so she did that really fucked up shit to break him. Like, whoa, but this guy is more or less red pill in his reaction (to be exact, it's just the reaction we're talking about), specifically, going away, talking to a friend about it instead of sobbing to his wife (yeah, I can imagine some emotionally weaker guys doing this), and keeping his emotions to himself, and when he finally breaks, he went to his friend to vent out. I think the bad part here is when he thought of maybe consoling her a little when she's emotional, but if he's thinking about being some sort of a rock to her storm, then all is well. While reading this, I thought, do you think emotionally strong guys should show some token displays of vulnerability, even if a fake one? Or this is a damn if you showed vulnerability (she'll lose attraction) and damn if you don't (she'll delete your work) situation? **EDIT:** It's clear that it's the woman's actions that got the better of him, but apparently, it's because his work were so important to him. For some reason, I think the woman knows deep inside that he gave in not because *of her*, but because something terrible happened to his life's work and the woman he married did it of all people and much worse, for ridiculous reasons. That thought is kind of playing in the corner of my head because most of the time, shit tests are directly related to the woman or the dynamics between the two of them. For example, girls will bring up guys hitting on them, talking about going to a girl's night out, directly or indirectly insulting his self-esteem, anything and they're usually confined in the realm of mind games (which they are so well aware of), so yeah, this one's really... uncommon. **UPDATE**: They reconciled. The guy was thinking that isn't enough of a ground for a divorce yet, despite the woman saying she'd understand if he divorces her. Using shit test goggles, this means -- I will do something very shitty to your work for my shallow reasons and because you like me so much you will still forgive me. I agree that the guy was rational in saying that it wasn't enough of ground for divorce. This is in the sense that it's not the extreme reasons we usually hear, so it might be seen by the courts as a one-time incident rather than a series of shitty behavior, that will be corroborated with the cat incident and perhaps other things not addressed. However, his rationality be damned. It is very likely that the woman in this scenario will still see it as him liking her so much he will not divorce her after doing that very shitty act. I don't have a theoretical way of explaining this, except that this is similar to how girls think you're their bitch once you hold her purse while you wait for her to finish using the girl's comfort room."

[NYT LINK](URL or TRP [LINK](URL Its my FR cherry popping, dont be gentle I like it rough. Back story: Coming back to town over winter break, I fired up Tinder. After a few hours of tweaking profile to include gym, wedding, and suited pictures, including a short n sweet description with a joke and height. I started getting matches the first night, and day 2 is when I matched with Tabitha (name changed). First date, drinks. She was late so I ordered two shots before she even got there (which arrived just as she sat down) of Jack Daniels as a penalty for being late. A couple beers later and we were making out in a corner of the bar. After some fun banter over text message, the following week we go out for dinner. Earlier that day I read the NYT article and thought it was at least good conversation material, at best shed fall in love. Win-win, as I am looking for a new plate. As were at dinner and shes figuring out what to order, I ask her question #1, dinner invite. We actually talked about other things for a few minutes, but she gave a good answer and asked for mine. Then, almost casually, T: so anymore questions from that article? which one is next? (quick, to the frame cave!) Me: what article? T:I think i read it in the NYT? Me:I actually had that as a college essay question, it was interesting and a good conversation starter soooooo actually what article? T:oh it was this thing about love Me:I call bullshit, Im googling it...*finds it*...Seriously?! Ok wait...*reads it*...what is this? ok some of these are interesting. Were doing this"" Cue rest of dinner and drinks going through almost all the questions. We skipped a few that seemed repetitive. As Ive already developed rapport with her for having a hard shell--as she puts it--I open up a bit in my answers. Im 25 and both parents are in nursing homes. Ive been bullied when younger. I figured this emotional connection would give her a taste of the salty and sweet--variety, and the soft side women crave to see exposed (Note: I believe its a fine line. I try to give a small glimpse of what could be seen over the course of many years). Something that struck me as quite interesting was a pattern in our conversation. If I answered first, shed echo my responses, increasing any show of vulnerability or emotion. If she went first, I would be funny/witty with my answers. Example: *2. Would you like to be famous? In what way?* T:Sure. My response as president"" *3. Before making a telephone call, do you ever rehearse what you are going to say? Why?* T: Always, and tells a story about practicing for a job interview. Me: I used to back in college when Im at a party calling my parents drunk, i rehearse saying Im in the library and when Im in the library, I practicing telling them ""Im not a nerd, Im actually at a party, I swear!"" *4. What would constitute a perfect day for you?* I said after waking up next to her then Id watch the sunset and walk her dogsoh really? hmm what makes you think that will happen? hey! dont interrupt its my turn"" *5. When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else?* She goes deep and shares a last few moments of a friend dying with cancer. Me: Happy Birthday to a friend a few weeks ago!"" *7. Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die?* Me: I think either of cancer, or Ill die in space. she says thats so cool. She doesnt know. *8. Name three things you and your partner appear to have in common.* Me:Were both enjoying dinner. We both dont know what to say to this question. We both want to kiss each other. After a moment of eye contact, I get up and kiss her in the restaurant wordlessly. *10. If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be?* T: (goes deep, explaining childhood was great and that she's very thankful"" Me: play more sports"" *13. If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, the future or anything else, what would you want to know?* Me: I'd want to know if or which religion is real T: What happens when we die *15. What is the greatest accomplishment of your life?* T: (laughs) not having been a teen pregnancy (maybe red flag?) Me: Getting up every time ive been knocked down at this point the tequila we were drinking with dinner is kicking in, and memory is foggy Overall, my strategy was to hold frame. Also this was my first post-pill date. I knew shed run if I was beta, so I tried to stay the hell away from that. Which I believe worked. For the Positive qualities (Question #22), she said that Im direct, motivated, intelligent, resilient, and have a good sense of humor. Almost exactly who I am showing the world I am (cue silent nod into breaking 4th wall to /r/theredpill). Anywho, the proof is in the pudding. I brought a nice wine to share with her for a movie at her place post dinner. As expected (at some point) she starts having LMR. She says ""Im tired, and I have to work at 5am tomorrow!"" I acted outcome ambivalent, didn't wine or plead, just walked over to my car and gave her the bottle of wine, and said warm it on your tiny bosom (making fun of something shed shared earlier). ""I'll come back for it tomorrow night."" I kissed her aggressively and pushed her into the side of her car, then when she tried to push into my body, I pushed her away then walked off and got into my car. Drove away, pleased with myself, but aware I didn't bowl 300. I was listening to music on the interstate, driving out of Hotlanta to the 'burbs when my phone starts ringing. *who could this be?* OH ITS TABITHA? Mild inner man excitement, and I try to hide it during the you wanna come over call. Wine, Movie (Django!). At this point in time, on the couch, but before making out, I remembered a post from a few weeks back where a guy fucked up by not pursuing a chick who invited him over. One of the commenters wrote ""dude she invited you over, she was game! Listen to what she does not what she says."" This gave me the confidence to get what I wanted--a good fucking. So after more LMR Im not having sex with you tonight during super aggressive make-out session on the couchand then ""I'm not taking my bra off""...""we're not going to my bed"" she told her dogs to ""stop cockblocking"" after I got her wet and bothered and we proceeded to fuck for an hour. I almost broke my hand on her ass, and I really didn't hold back on the slapping (first time going that HAM). She sucked the white off my cock, and I went home around 1 grinning. Thanks /r/theredpill for all the great info and advice. Hopefully this is a post worthy of this sub. EDIT: formatting, linking, grammar and punctuation"
179,vulnerability,TheRedPill,CRAZY bitches stories,0,2srf78,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2srf78/crazy_bitches_stories/,2015-01-18 07:00:47,"A while back I had this one girl that was a foreign exchange student from singapore and she would text me frequently around midnight to ask if she could come over and suck my dick. I obviously obliged and she'd suck my dick, lick my balls and asshole for a good half hour straight. I was seriously impressed with this girl's dedication to be honest. I mean this girl was literally too good to be true, big tits, small tight body, pretty face, sweet, and submissive as fuck. Even my roommates all said the same thing. After sex she'd even go as far as to clean my room and do the dishes. I'd fuck her, leave for class and when I came back she'd be waiting for me. At the end of the year, she had to go back to singapore and we left on amazing terms. We kissed, cuddled and said our farewells. Perfect ending to a fairytale fuckbuddy relationship, or so I thought. Months later I check in on facebook to see how she's doing and it turns out she deleted me as a friend. I ask her what's up and she replied she felt used and hated me. She said I ruined sex for her and abused her vulnerability and loneliness. I was absolutely shocked, note that this girl did not ONCE mention ANYTHING about me not treating her right. She didn't even seem upset AT ALL throughout all our times together. She was also almost ALWAYS the first one to ask to come over and suck my dick. She continued going on a looong and personal tirade exploiting everything she knew about me. Saying how she was glad my dad died when I was younger, how my dick was too small and how I was inadequate in bed etc.etc. Basically, bitches can be fucking crazyyy. What are your craziest experiences with girls?"

Here's an article I call [The Angry Woman and the ~~Passive~~ Beta Male](URL When I read this, the beta male part is clearly an add on, so the author can speak about women without any accusation of ""what abotu teh menz."" Here's what locks that for me &gt;To summarize my concern, **American women tend to be more unrealistic about marriage than their sisters around the world**. Movies and television have made them feel that romantic excitement is not only a birthright, but the most important aspect of marriage. When this ""feeling"" component of the relationship is missing, the family is doomed. It'll just have to be scrapped. Not even the welfare of the children is important enough to preserve the marriage, and that is tragic. &gt;With all due respect, **my most difficult task may be to help you recognize yourselves as part of the problem**. The angry women I've counseled in the past have been so consumed by their husbands' disrespect and failures that they couldn't acknowledge their role in his inability to respond. But certainly, they had helped to make him what he was. Michelle Langley covers feminine rage in her important work on Women's infidelity. She also discusses how their rage is unrealistic. She blames society for creating in women a deep distrust and hatred for men, and how for women, men are under a presumption of guilt. Langley, in her second book, discusses how women arent aware of the transgressions they do, collectively, against men, like domestic abuse. Womens transgressions against men are kept out of the public eye. So, women end up being bombarded by messages on how men are terrible to women, fail to see how women are also terrible to men, and this makes women covertly furious because they *feel* that the world is only biased against them and being a man is all sunshine and unicorn farts. She continues with the imbalance in prison sentences and other topics brought up in /r/mensrights. Michelle spends more of her book dismantling this image that feminism has wrought over the genders and points out some important parts where women are unreasonable in arguments - much like how the Angry woman article does above. A woman may ask about a man's feelings, but really, this is all about her feelings. Why she's not *haaaaapy.* Why you are to blame and why she sees you responsible for her happiness, and how its unreasonable. [Watch the hamster on watching a woman have to admit she asked for a mans vulnerability and hates a mans vulnerability](URL All she wants is for it to be about her. Langley makes the same point. Solipsism. its part of their anger and its unreasonable. They don't want to admit their part in this role. So, if *American women tend to be more unrealistic about marriage than their sisters around the world,* then, fuck them. Their anger is fucking impossible. Sure, other girls arent some sort of panacea, but, fuck, how do you want me to be a captain when my potential first mate is pissy with unreasonable rage. "
