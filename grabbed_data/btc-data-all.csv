This has shown a weakness in Bitcoin. If miners cannot think/act for themselves, then we are doomed. This is just one attack vector amongst hundreds more, and we have to accept that vulnerability and find a way to address it whilst still allowing miners to actually vote/shift to that which they truly support. Bitcoin threatens the entire world economy. The money of every government. Of every dictatorship. Every bad actor in this world with money to lose. Do not be disheartened by the nature of disruptive, decentralized technology being under attack. When the attacks stop, **then** we should be concerned."

This decision was made when considering the appeal of Richard Gratkowski, sentenced to 5 years and 10 months in prison. Earlier, the FBI found out that between June 2016 and May 2017, Richard Gratkovsky used Bitcoins to purchase prohibited pornographic materials involving minors. Having detected the wallets used by him, the agency turned to Coinbase with a request to disclose information about this client. The exchange complied with this requirement without a court order.  Binance Exchange has confirmed the launch of a cryptocurrency debit card in partnership with Swipe. Information about this appeared on the official website of the company but later disappeared. One of the features of the card will be the ability to exchange cryptocurrencies for fiat money in real-time. Users will be able to transfer money to the card directly from the Binance trading account. Payments will be instant, funds can be spent immediately after crediting. In addition, cardholders will be able to withdraw cash from ATMs.  The District of Columbia Bar has allowed lawyers in Washington D.C. to accept payments in Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. Representatives of the organization noted that cryptocurrencies are rapidly gaining popularity as a means of payment and lawyers cannot stand aside from these changes. Acceptance of payment in crypto is permissible if the lawyer is able to ensure the safe storage of assets. To do this, he must have basic knowledge in the field of blockchain. **Projects, Collaborations, Startups**  BlockFi, a company operating in the cryptocurrency lending market, reported a doubling of monthly revenue in the second quarter. The driver was halving and launching a mobile application. By now, monthly income has quadrupled since the end of last year and doubled if we start from the end of March, said Zac Prince, co-founder, and CEO of the startup.  CoinGecko, an analytical service, has announced a partnership with cybersecurity company Hacken. As part of the collaboration, CoinGecko integrated into the so-called Trust Score cryptocurrency exchange security assessment metrics based on the platform data from Hacken. Among others, Hacken considers platform infrastructure security, including server security, two-factor user authentication, spam and phishing protection, and other criteria.  According to Messari, the market capitalization of dollar-tied stablecoin Tether (USDT) reached $10.3 billion. The growth since the beginning of the year, when the figure was $4.76 billion, exceeded 116%. Other stablecoins are significantly inferior to USDT in terms of market supply.  Binance cryptocurrency exchange has completed a major update of the trading engine, increasing the processing speed of operations by 10 times, company CEO Changpeng Zhao said. According to him, the update was the largest in the history of Binance. It took two years to develop it. Zhao noted that in doing so, the exchange is preparing the next wave of cryptocurrency market growth. **Blockchain**  According to Messari, Bitcoin and Ethereum account for more than 99% of the commissions received by all miners. Over the past 24 hours, the total amount of commissions in the Bitcoin network has amounted to $407,571. Ethereum has a significantly higher rate  $814,082.  On June 30, at block # 637 056 in the Bitcoin network, the planned recalculation of mining complexity took place. The indicator has undergone the most insignificant change since March 22, 2010, having decreased by 0.0033% from 15.7847 T to 15.7842 T. Thus, the complexity of mining Bitcoin almost did not change for the first time in 10 years.  A transaction of 101 857 BTC (\~$ 933 million at the time of sending) was recorded in the Bitcoin network between anonymous addresses. Transaction passed between anonymous addresses. The commission was only 48 cents. An anonymous whale used the SegWit protocol, which reduced costs by 41%.  One of the Bitcoin users included the message Hello, Noah! Welcome to the world, little one in one of the transactions, thus recording the birth of their first child. The unchanging and censorship-resistant nature of Bitcoin will ensure that this message remains forever on the blockchain while it continues to function. The current case demonstrates a widely discussed scenario for using the first cryptocurrency as a decentralized database. **Hacking, Cyber Crimes**  Russian Sergei Medvedev admitted involvement in the cybercriminal organization Infraud, which traded stolen personal data, compromised credit cards, malware, and other illegal things. Over the course of its seven-year history, Infraud caused an estimated loss of about $2.2 billion and more than $568 million in actual losses to a wide range of financial institutions, sellers and individuals, the US Department of Justice declared.  The criminals received a $1.14 million ransom after a successful attack on the University of California. The software installed by hackers encrypted the data on the universitys servers at the School of Medicine, making the information temporarily unavailable. To fix the problem, the institution had to pay 116.4 BTC.  An unknown hacker managed to withdraw $500,000 in altcoins WETH, WBTC, SNX, and LINK from the pool of the Balancer Labs DeFi project using a smart contract vulnerability that allowed an attacker to create a shortage of funds in the pools. &amp;#x200B; Thats all for now!

2,vulnerability,btc,Thoughts on Grasberg DAA,76,hx4kgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/hx4kgz/thoughts_on_grasberg_daa/,2020-07-25 02:11:18,"*Preface: I'd given up hope on BCH ever getting a DAA and I'm pleasantly surprised that this seems to be happening. I've decided to do a review. Sorry if this repeats some points made by other people, and my apologies that I haven't had the energy to track all the discussions and developments being done on this topic. Also, I originally intended to just post this as a reply on another post but it got too long.* --- Grasberg is a new difficulty algorithm designed by Amaury Sechet, which is based on the exponential difficulty algorithm family under recent discussion, but with a modification to change the block interval. The main practical consequences for BCH adopting it would be: - For the next 6-7 years, only ~128 blocks will be mined per day (i.e., 1 per ~11 minutes), instead of the usual 144. - Miners who are dedicated to BCH ('steady miners') should be much less penalized, compared to current DAA. - It is expected that this in turn will incentivise more miners to mine on BCH steadily, which means a reduction in block time variance and thus better user experience. (Perhaps there will also be less switch miners, but my understanding is that this does not have significant impact.) - Unlike a regular upgrade, all SPV wallet users will need to upgrade too. A high level I judge the algorithm should be safe. HOWEVER: I find the detailed algorithm is unnecessarily complex for what it accomplishes, i.e., the same thing could be done much simpler. Complexity is a concern especially for this consensus rule, because not only do full nodes have to implement the algorithm perfectly, so do SPV wallets. People will have to implement this in java, python, etc., perfectly implementing all the intricacies of each arithmetic operation. I feel like just a few more hours spent on clean KISS engineering here would save a lot of headache for everyone else down the road. On a related note, I also strongly urge to adopt additional timestamp control rules, regardless of the DAA. (see bottom) Since there is no spec, I am basing my review on [this specific version of the source code](URL I assume this is the definition of Grasberg. I may have made some mistakes in understanding the code, and if so, this means that an actual specification and better code comments are sorely needed. I am going to focus on the underlying algorithm and ideas which other implementors must exactly reproduce, not the details of ABC implementation or C++. I will start out with a basic description: ## High-level description of algorithm The algorithm bases the difficulty of each block on the previous block's difficulty, increased or decreased according to an exponential function of the timestamp difference between the previous and previous-previous blocks. As explained in a document I wrote a while ago, simple algorithms of this kind allow a recursive understanding of the difficulty in terms of any past block (the ASERT idea), which in turn means we know that timestamp manipulations will always cancel out in the end. This is an important security property, though of course not the only important property. Grasberg is not just this, rather it is tweaked slightly to vary the targeted block interval - why would this be? There is a philosophical question of whether in the long run, blockchains should aim for an exact average block time, or, whether an accumulated or historical discrepancy is fine. Discrepancies can happen due to bad design or they may be a 'natural' and intentional part of design from the fact that hashrate is ever-rising, as in the case of the Satoshi difficulty algorithm (ASERT too). The Grasberg modification is apparently based on the viewpoint that this discrepancy is wrong, and blocks really ought to have been mined at exactly 10 minutes per block all along. So it modifies the exponential to choose a slightly longer block time until this overmining injustice has been 'repaid', if you will. I'm not surprised at this idea, as I've thought about precisely this modification in the past, and my conclusion was (and is) that I can't see any serious technical issues with it. It does break the recursive property of the simple exponential, and so the strict security property I mentioned is now invalid. But practically, it is clipped to +/-13% so my intuition is that any attacks would be bounded to a 13% profitability, and it would be tricky to exploit so it is a minor concern. But this deserves a disclaimer: DAA algorithm repercussions are sometimes very nonintuitive, and any small tweak that 'shouldn't really hurt' can sometimes end up being a vulnerability, only realized much later on. Every tweak is playing with fire. Personally, I don't have strong feelings either way about the philosophy of doing blockchain reparations to maintain an exact long term schedule, so I think the high-level idea of this algorithm is fine. However, I can imagine that that blockchain reparations are not widely desired, and I would personally not have pushed to include them unless there was clear demand. ## Comments on algorithm details As alluded to above, I think the algorithm has way more complexity and computation than is needed. `deterministicExp2` is an approximation to 2^x - 1, for 0&lt;=x&lt;1, in fixed point math. It is a compound curve made up of 16 quadratic segments with discontinuities. [It has a ~1 ppm accuracy](URL (if I have translated it correctly). I find this algorithm is much more complicated than is needed for its accuracy level, but also I don't know why this accuracy level was selected in the first place: - It uses truncated Taylor series. Such truncated Taylor series are OK but not great approximations. (Taylor series are not at all intended to be ideal when truncated). For the given segments, local curve fits of the same polynomial order would be significantly better. Not only would fits be more accurate, but they would be able to remove the discontinuities (if so desired). Conversely, the same accuracy would be obtained with much fewer segments. - The implementation requires local recentering of the coordinate which is just more steps. These are polynomials and there are already coefficient tables, can the coefficients not simply absorb the shifts? - At the same time, I do not know why a 1 ppm accuracy level was chosen. For the purposes of the DAA in question, a 1000 ppm accuracy is likely entirely sufficient. This can be achieved even with just two quadratic segments (fitted). A question that should be easy to answer if 1000 ppm is insufficient: why is 1 ppm sufficient instead of making this function have ""perfect"" accuracy (0.2 ppb for the 32-bit precision)? See also my remark on GetCompact inaccuracy, below. - There ought to be many simpler alternatives, they are not hard to come up with. A third-order polynomial over full range (as I've posted before) is nice since it allows 16-bit inputs and needs only a few 64-bit internal operations, and gives decent accuracy. That is an example of simplicity, there are many other simple ways to do it (I can work on this and provide some more, if anyone cares). `computeTargetBlockTime` computes the drift-adjusted target block time: [an exponential, with clipped upper and lower values](URL I do not understand why an exponential curve was chosen here, and I can't think of any underlying reason or theory why it must be this curve rather than some other curve. As can be seen by the plot, however, it is actually nearly piecewise linear, very slightly curving up. Why does this *need* to very slightly curve up, instead of, say, very slightly curving down, or just being straight? I have no idea, but I do know that a simple line is the cleanest design unless these curvings have a reason. Just use a line. As for the slope used for `computeTargetBlockTime` (600 seconds per two weeks), my feeling is this is a bit fast: when I was mulling over this same concept a long time ago, I was imagining a ~10x longer timescale than that. As a general rule a gentler slope is not going to cause a problem, but a too-fast slope certainly might, and there is no actual need to 'rush' towards correcting block times. The fact that the clipping points are placed at +/-2.5 days drift also makes me a bit nervous since this is comparable to the main algorithm's timescale (~2 days). Right now I can't imagine a specific interaction, but it just feels weird. (as for the clipping, the chosen value of 13% is probably a good level. I would not go any higher than 15%, and 5% or under wouldn't really be worth the trouble.) `ComputeNextWork` and `GetNextGrasbergWorkRequired` requires unnecessarily many 256-bit arithmetic steps. In fact, the whole involvement of 256-bit arithmetic can be totally avoided! Remember, the whole idea and goal is to compute the next DiffBits based on previous DiffBits, and all the intermediate steps (256-bit target or difficulty) have no independent meaning. These DiffBits are floating point numbers of low precision, and the difficulty algorithm is exponential; therefore it is easier, simpler, and faster to *do the whole thing without touching 256-bit arithmetic*, instead just a few easy computations on mantissa and exponent of DiffBits. It would be equally accurate. Actually, it would be *more* accurate since it would not use the poor `arith_uint256::GetCompact` algorithm which does not even round properly. (this is by far the worst inaccuracy in the whole algorithm, by the way, and even with proper rounding there will always be the intrinsic imprecision in the final DiffBits result). I thought these would be pretty obvious advantages of the exponential algorithms and I'm surprised this route was not taken. `ComputeNextWork` includes clipping of the difficulty change at extreme values (factor of 2^32 increase or decrease in difficulty). Note this issue would be irrelevant if doing DiffBits arithmetic directly (see above), but even if it is insisted to use 256-bit arithmetic, these limits seem to be due to a misunderstanding. For right-shifting, there is no overflow. There is a concern that a divide by zero in `ComputeTargetFromWork` might occur, but this is directly prevented by replacing a 0 difficulty with 1 (gets converted to powLimit in the end, anyway). As for left-shifting, I see the concern but this is artificial. For xi &gt;= 0, it is perfectly acceptable to compute `(lastBlockWork + (offsetWork32 &gt;&gt; 32)) &lt;&lt; xi`; this is still super accurate since lastBlockWork &gt;= 2^32 (as already assumed by this function), and it's easy to examine `.bits()` before left shifting to see if it is going to overflow. By the way if overflow is *really* a concern, then there technically ought to also be checks on whether the `offsetWork32` computation or ``(lastBlockWork + (offsetWork32 &gt;&gt; 32))` computation are going to overflow, which could happen regardless of the value of xi. If these overflows are believed to be impossible, then comments to the effect should be included. (Note that if xi &gt; 32 and the difficulty increases by 4 billion times, or whatever, then something seriously wrong has happened because this means a very backwards timestamp appeared, and now the blockchain is probably stuck in some way. It's worth reminding that this kind of situation would not happen in the first place with timestamp controls, as described at end of post.) The testnet difficulty adjustment seems weird to me (if I understand it right) because when min-difficulty blocks are being mined, they do not cause the the 'real difficulty' to decrease naturally over time like with the previous DAAs. Instead the real difficulty stays high and constant until a real-difficulty block is actually mined, then the difficulty will suddenly drop by an unnecessarily large factor if the chain was ""stuck"" at high difficulty, disregarding the fact that there may have been many min-difficulty blocks in-between. A natural dropping could be easily incorporated by using the recursive property of ASERT, i.e., using the last real-difficulty block as the 'reference block'. This doesn't have to add any complexity to the code besides computing a block height difference. Alternatively, it could be a fun experiment (and appropriate IMO) to use a real-time ASERT on testnet, instead of having the min-difficutly reset. This would of course be more inconvenient after someone pumps up the difficulty, unless the relaxation time is very short. The main downside is it would be more complex. Finally a minor point: The algorithm involves both concepts of relaxation time (e^x) and half-life (2^x). It would be simpler to just use half-lives everywhere -- they are the natural variable since the math is binary. I.e., just define the half-life as 120000 seconds. (a second very minor nit on how to think about this: in exponential algos the crucial point is that half life really is a *time*, not a number of blocks, so it's best to define it and think of it explicitly as X time rather than as N block intervals.). ## Importance of improved timestamp controls (This is not part of difficulty algorithm, but it is related.) Currently, BCH only applies the median-time-past rule for block timestamps. This allows non-monotonic block time sequences. As documented by Zawy, this is something which in general has been a subtle cause of very serious grief for difficulty algorithms. In the worst cases, a bad DAA allows miners to manipulate timestamps to allow rapidly mining blocks without raising the difficulty. This means an economic disaster for the blockchain since it causes rapid inflation by block subsidies. Various difficulty algorithms employed in the cryptocurrency space are vulnerable to this, even right now. The exponential algorithms are fundamentally immune to this, though small modifications (like Grasberg's) can actually compromise this immunity. In the case of Grasberg's gradually adapting target block time, this will of course not matter for the next 6 years since it is pinned. After that, however, I would not be surprised if theoretically, miners could use weird nonmonotonic timestamp sequences to have blocks coming out 13% faster than ought to happen. Even if true, though, I expect this attack to be very tricky, probably also risky, and given that I expect a bounded finite benefit I guess it would be impractical. There is however a totally separate and more immediate issue relating to non-monotonic timestamps. Exponential algorithms allow large upward jumps in difficulty if the timestamp change is very negative. This means that if there is a large span of time over which few blocks are mined (as happens if the hashrate falls, because difficulty is too high), and finally some blocks are mined that lower difficulty, it means that disruptive miners can mine blocks with highly backwards timestamps, which immediately shoots the difficulty back up again to its previous level; the drought continues. Of course, the difficulty algorithm must respond in this exact way (or else it can be exploited for inflation, which would be far far worse), however we should not be allowing such a situation in the first place. I want to emphasize that this kind of disruptive back-mining has *worse* consequences for the exponential DAA (compared to the averaging DAAs). That said, it only becomes serious in extreme situations. I can't see any reason to allow non-monotonic timestamps. Speaking for myself, every counterargument to this idea that I've seen has been invalid on further thinking. (There is far too much on this topic to go into detail here.) It would be sufficient to have even just an added restriction that timestamps can't go backwards by more than 1 hour, if people are scared of monotonicity. (but, they have no good reason to be)"

4,vulnerability,btc,BTC vs BCH,1,glo3v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/glo3v0/btc_vs_bch/,2020-05-18 07:44:47,"The blocksize of BTC is 1mb. Block size of BCH is 8mb. This means BCH has the ability to process more transactions in the same amount of time as compared to BTC. This is absolutely a plus when it comes to widespread adoption. With this alone, BTC seems to be more appropriate as a store of value, rather than a means of payment. However there is a drawback to this enhanced blocksize and that is the potential for centralization. BTC is not excluded from this risk, but BCH has it's own vulnerability too. The larger the block size, the more expensive it is to run a node, which could lead to centralization, since it's less affordable and that much more unattainable for the average person. BTC looks to solve scaling with 2nd layer tech like sidechains and other solutions. Doesn't seem like this is swooping in particularly quickly and BCH is winning the race in this regard so far. Scaling is not the only relevant factor here though. Transaction fees are important as it will largely determine the plausibility of application. If I had to pay a dollar every time I swiped my debit card I'd find something else. Lower transaction fees support adoption in the case of active use. With that being said, higher transaction fees don't necessarily render BTC unusable. Like I said before, it can still function as a store of value and it seems now there are two reasons why this seems more reasonable for BTC. Unless 2 layer tech can really take off, again, it seems like BCH is winning the active application race as far as it's tech goes. Anything that can be exploited, probably will be exploited. BTC started great, but people found a way to take advantage. This is probably going to happen to BCH, people are lovely creatures. One thing that BTC has over BCH is hashrate. BTC's higher hashrate helps keep the integrity of the network secure. BCH is more susceptible to attack in this regard. Both BTC and BCH are not perfect. Both have time and need for improvement and I can't say I'm particularly sold on one being completely better than the other. With that being said, neither is immune to competition and it could be a matter of time before something comes about that has none of the problems that either of these have, as well as legislative endorsement (not that I personally care about that, but it's likely to be highly impactful as crypto becomes more mainstream). I read a lot of posts on here that are all BTC or all BCH, but I'm not favoring one over the other at this time. Thoughts? Objections? Extensions? Rebuttals?"

Samsung integrates the custodial and trading service of the Gemini Bitcoin exchange into the blockchain wallet. Users will be able to buy, sell, exchange and store digital assets through the application.  The crypto community drew attention to the growing popularity of BTC. According to Glassnode, the number of investors who own one or more Bitcoins has reached a record high. At the same time, the volume of BTC on the balances of digital asset exchanges, on the contrary, dropped to an 18-month low.  Vitaliy Antonenko, a Ukrainian detainee in New York, faces 20 years in prison and a heavy fine. Antonenko is accused of a series of cybercrimes with the aim of stealing bank cards data. According to investigators, he sold the stolen data along with his accomplices on the darknet. Earned money ($94 million), he allegedly laundered using Bitcoin.  According to the crypto analyst under the nickname CryptoKea, Bitcoin miners have turned into cryptocurrency sellers and the trend is growing. Over the past seven days, miners have sold 955 BTC more than they mined, putting pressure on cryptocurrency quotes. This happens because miners turn off unprofitable equipment, but are forced to sell coins from stocks to pay for operating expenses, CryptoKea noted.  According to Glassnode, users have withdrawn over 310,000 Bitcoins from exchanges since the March market crash, dubbed Black Thursday. This is the longest observed period of cryptocurrency outflow from centralized trading spaces.  The hacker group Blue Mockingbird hacked at least a thousand corporate servers to install a hidden miner for the Monero cryptocurrency on them, ZDNet reports. To carry out the attack, hackers took advantage of a vulnerability in the platform of client interface components for web services.  The number of ETH addresses with above zero balance has grown by 350% since January 2018, when the market value of cryptocurrency reached a historic high of $1,400. According to a Weiss Crypto Ratings study, Ethereum outperforms Bitcoin in the number of addresses with a positive balance and the number of active users.

Was it clear? Did you get any value from it? Anything that needs to be expanded on? - we are really excited about this project and hope to make it to the best of our abilities. \---- # 1 Introduction to the Bitcoin System # 1.1 Introduction and General Description There are many definitions and descriptions of Bitcoin. Some describe it as an innovative virtual or crypto currency, some as the system for peer-topeer electronic cash payment transactions, and some others as decentralized platform and infrastructure for anonymous payment transactions using any type of crypto currency. In this Report we will adopt the concept that the Bitcoin system is a payment system. It has its own features, its own currency, its own protocols and components, and with all that Bitcoin supports payment transactions. In other words, the core function of the Bitcoin system is to support payments between two parties  the party that makes a payment and the party that receives the payment. Based on the original concept and the description of the Bitcoin \[Bitcoin, 2016\], *it is a decentralized digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: transaction management and money issuance are carried out collectively by the network*. The system is *decentralized* since its supporting platform blockchain, comprises an infrastructure of multiple distributed servers, mutually linked by an instantaneous broadcasting protocol. Users perform transactions within the open and distributed community of registered users. Digital currency used in the system is not electronic form of fiat currency, but a special form of the currency generated and used only within the Bitcoin system. This concept is based on the notion that money can be interpreted as any object, or any sort of record, that is accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given country or socio-economic context. Bitcoin system is designed around the idea of using *cryptography* to control the creation and transfer of money, rather than relying on central authorities. There are several important requirements when making any type of payment and with any currency. The best example of a perfect payment transaction that meets all these requirements is *payment using cash over-the-counter*. When a consumer pays to a merchant using cash over-the-counter, such transaction satisfies all requirements and expectations of both parties. First, the transaction is *instantaneous*, as the paper bill is transferred hand-to-hand, from the consumer to the merchant. The transaction is *cheap*, in fact there is no overhead charge to perform transaction, so the merchant receives the full amount. The transaction is *irreversible*, what is the property beneficial to merchants. The transaction is *legal*, as the merchant can verify the legality of the paper bill. And, finally, the transaction is *anonymous* for the consumer as he/she does not need to reveal his/her identity. The only problem with cash over-the-counter is the *cash* itself, as using and handling cash has many disadvantages. Bitcoin concept and system solves all issues and problems with the use of cash, but at the same time provides all advantages when performing transactions using *digital* and *communication* technologies. So, paying with Bitcoins is effectively payment transaction that uses digital cash over-the-counter. The concept of the Bitcoin system provides all advantages and benefits mentioned above with payments using cash over-the-counter, but eliminates the problems of using cash. That is the reason why Bitcoins are often referred to as digital cash. One of significant features of payments using cash over-the-counter is that there are *no third* *parties* to participate or assist in the execution and validation of a transaction. This feature makes Bitcoin transactions *very efficient* and also *very cheap* to perform. Other types of todays payment systems, for instance using bank-to-bank account transfers or using bankcards, use many additional intermediate parties and use very complicated background infrastructure to validate and clear payment transactions. These infrastructures are *complex* to establish and operate, they are *expensive*, and they are *vulnerable* to attacks and penetrations by hackers. Bitcoin does not use such complex infrastructures, what is the reason that its transactions are efficient and cheap. An additional problem with third-party transaction players is that transaction parties must put the *complete trust* in all these parties without any means to verify their functionality, correctness, or security. Bitcoin system uses *public-key cryptography* to protect the currency and transactions. Logical relationships between transaction parties is direct, peer-to-peer, and the process of validating transactions is based on cryptographic *proof-of-work*. When performing a transaction, the net effect is that certain amount of Bitcoins is transferred from one cryptographic address to another. Each user may have and use several addresses simultaneously. Each payment transaction is broadcast to the network of distributed transaction processing servers. These servers collect individual transactions, package them into blocks, and send them for validation. Each block is cryptographically processed by the large number of so called miners. They each attempt to create cryptographic hash value that has special form. This is computationally very difficult and time-consuming task, therefore, it is very difficult to perform and repeat. Individual blocks are validated using cryptographic processing procedures that require substantial amount of work and computing power. Approximately an hour or two after submitting the transaction for validation, each transaction is locked in time and by cryptographic processing by the massive amount of computing power that was used to complete the block. When the block is validated, it is added to the chain of all previous blocks, thus forming a public archive of all blocks and transactions in the system. One of the most important problems with uncontrolled digital currency, where there are no third parties to validate and approve transactions, is so called *double* *spending*. Since the currency is digital, stored at users local workstations, in mobile phones, or on network servers, it can be easily copied and sent to multiple recipients multiple times. Bitcoin system solves this problem with a very interesting approach. It is the first effective example of the solution for the double-spending problem without the need for assistance of any third party. Bitcoin solves this problem by keeping and distributing an archive of all transactions among all the users of the system via a peer-to-peer distribution network. Every transaction that occurs in the Bitcoin system is recorded in that public and distributed transactions ledger. Since the components in that ledger are blocks with transactions and the blocks are chained in time and in a cryptographic sequence, the ledger in the Bitcoin system is called *blockchain*. That full blockchain of all transactions that were performed in the Bitcoin system before the specific transaction can be used to verify new transactions. The transactions are verified against the blockchain to ensure that the same Bitcoins have not been previously spent. This approach eliminates the double-spending problem. The essence of the verification procedure for a single transaction in fact is the test of the balance of the sending account. The test is very normal and natural: payment of a certain amount of the currency can be made only of the balance of the outgoing account is equal or larger than the payment amount. Current balance of an account is established by tracing all incoming and outgoing transactions for that account. The procedure to verify the validity of individual transactions and to prevent double-spending is based on the use of special type of cryptographic protocol called *public-key cryptography*. With this type of cryptographic systems each user has two cryptographic keys. They are mutually related in the sense that, what ever the one key encrypts, the other key can decrypt. One of the two keys is a *private key* that is kept secret, and the other key is *public key* that can be shared with all other users in the system. When a user wants to make a payment to another user, the sender transfers certain amount of Bitcoins from his/her account to the account of the receiver. This action is performed by the sender by creating a payment message, called a transaction, which contains recipients public key  receiving address and payment amount. The transaction is cryptographically processed by the senders private key, the operation called *digital signing*, and as the result digital signature is created and appended to the transaction. By using senders private key every user in the system can verify that the transaction was indeed created by the indicated sender, as his/her private key can successfully decrypt the content of the digital signature. The exchange is authentic, since the transaction was also cryptographically processed with the recipients public key, the operation which is called digital enveloping. This transformation guarantees that the transaction can be accepted and processed only by the holder of the corresponding private key, which is the intended recipient. Every transaction, and thus the transfer of ownership of the specified amount of Bitcoins, is inserted, then time-stamped, and finally displayed in one block of the blockchain. Public-key cryptography ensures that all computers in the network have a constantly updated and verified record of all transactions within the Bitcoin network, which prevents double-spending and fraud. ## 1.2 The Concept and Features of the Bitcoin System There are many concepts and even more operational payment systems today in the world. Some are standard paperbased, some are digital and network based. What makes Bitcoin unique and distinctive, compared with all other payment systems that are in use today, are several of its core features. The first of them is that the system uses *its own currency*. The reason for using its own currency is to make the system independent of financial institutions as trusted third parties. The unit of the currency is called *Bitcoin*. The currency is so called *crypto* *currency*, because it is generated and used based on execution of certain cryptographic algorithms and protocols. Performing specific cryptographic protocols is in the heart of operations to create new Bitcoins, to transfer them between transaction parties, and to validate the correctness of transactions. Since appearance of Bitcoins, several new systems were introduced that use cryptography to manage its own currency, so all such currencies represent the category of *crypto currencies*. Later in this Report, some other digital / virtual currencies will be described that are created and managed using some other principles, so they are not called crypto currency. At the time of writing this Report, all such digital virtual currencies were called with general term *tokens*, sometimes also *digital assets tokens*. The reason is that they were created by the process called *collateralization* and therefore they are related to the value of some categories of real world assets which is expressed in digital tokens units. The second interesting and important feature of the Bitcoin system is that the logical relationship between the two transaction parties is *direct, peer-topeer*, i.e. there are no other parties that participate in the transaction. This is an important feature and benefit / advantage of the system that contributes to its efficiency when compared with the todays complex and expensive financial payment infrastructures and protocols. However, for distribution of transactions to their validators and later to all other members in the Bitcoin system the physical flow of each transaction is very complex and includes many parties. It should be emphasized that performing transactions as direct, peer-topeer transfers is one of the key features and the most significant reason for many benefits and advantages of the Bitcoin system. This approach is the key feature of the Bitcoin system as it enables security and anonymity of parties, efficiency in performing transactions, scaling of the system, and instantaneous settlement of payments. Therefore, supporting execution and validation of serious business peertopeer transactions is one of the core benefits of the blockchain concept, as it changes the current paradigm of Internet applications and transactions. Currently all Internet applications are organized and performed as clientserver transactions. Such transactions are not efficient, do not provide sufficient privacy of participants, have dependencies on third parties and usually are vulnerable due to attacks of functional problems with large centralized application servers. The next very important characteristic of the Bitcoin system is *anonymity of users*, their *accounts*, and *transactions*. This property means that the identities of the participants in the system are not known even to the partners performing a payment transaction. All other system operations  receiving payments, making payments, validating transactions, etc. are also performed anonymously. Interpreting this property correctly, the anonymity of transaction participants is so called *pseudo-anonymity*. Namely, in the process of validating transactions, all previous transactions of the sender are traced back to the original initial transaction. If that initial transaction was the purchase of Bitcoins at some Bitcoin Exchange, then the identity of the original owner of Bitcoins is known. Most if not all service providers in the Bitcoin system today require very strict identification of participants for the purpose of enforcing legal and regulated transactions and include certain restrictions of transaction frequency and amounts. This procedure, although understandable from the legal and regulatory point of view, has in fact in essence changed one of the core principles of the original concept of the Bitcoin system  full anonymity of users. Better solution for fully anonymous payment transactions is so called *zeroknowledge protocol*, where the identity and authorization to perform Bitcoin transactions, is validated by anyone without revealing any identity information of the parties. The only problem with this approach is revealing the identity of transaction participants to law enforcement authorities in case of illegal transactions. But, such authorities have special authorization under the law and they should be enabled to get identifying information about transaction participants in the process of legal law enforcement procedures. But, all other service providers do not have such status, so if Bitcoin principles are strictly followed, they should not be able to have identifying information about system participants. This approach and potential improvement of the Bitcoin system implies that the system needs one of the classical security services: *rolebased authorization*. In such arrangement, there would be at least two categories of system participants: those that are authorized to maintain and access identifying information about the participants and those that are only authorized to perform transactions. In the first category are legal authorities, like police, driving license authorities, tax authorities, etc. In the context of the standard Identities Management Systems, such participants are called *Identity Providers*. All others are *Identity Verifiers*. Therefore, one of the main conclusions about true anonymity in the Bitcoin system is establishment of a sophisticated and multi-role Identities Management System, where some parties will be authorized Identity Providers and all others will be Identity Validators. Finally, referring back to the infrastructure of the Bitcoin system to perform and validate transactions  blockchain, the conclusion is that what is needed, as one of the most important extensions of the current concept of anonymity of Bitcoins participants, is an Identity Management System based itself on the use of blockchain and without Identity Providers as trusted third parties. Creation, distribution, use and validation of identities are transactions in the system, equivalent to payment transactions, so they should also be performed using blockchain protocol. Such system, that can provide reliable identities of all participants may be called *Blockchain Identity Management System*. Another very important feature of the original concept of the Bitcoin system is that it is not controlled by any financial institution, by any regulatory body or by any legal financial authority when it comes to issuing Bitcoins and determining their value. This means that the currency used in the system and all transactions are exempted from any legal and financial rules and regulations. The rules controlling Bitcoin system are built in its code. This property is usually called *rule by the technical code*, as the rules of system operations, built in the code of its operational components, control and rule the operations of the system \[UK, 2016\], Chapter 3. This property is sometimes described as *control by the community*, i.e. the participating users. This property implies that the value of Bitcoins is determined solely on the market  based on its supply and demand. This is quite natural approach, as the value of shares of companies are also determined on an open trading market. However, such approach implies that the value of Bitcoin, as crypto currency, is *volatile* related to fiat currencies. This property represent serious problem to perform payments using Bitcoin. It is well-known that volatile currencies are not suitable for payments. The practice of all the years while Bitcoins are in use has shown that its volatility represents one of the major obstacles for its main purpose  to be used as the payment system. In fact, it was announced that in 2019 the total value of Bitcoin transactions performed was about $ 11 T. However, unfortunately, only about 1.3% of those transactions were payments, all others were trading manipulations on exchanges. Based on that, it may be clearly stated that Bitcoin today is not used as the payment system, but as currency manipulation system. This is one of the main problems with the concept and current implementation and deployment of Bitcoin system and in near future may represent the main reason for its decline in popularity. ## 1.3 Innovative Contributions of the Bitcoin System Besides an effective procedure to transfer an amount of crypto currency from one user (account) to another user (account), the major and indeed an essential contribution of the concept of the Bitcoin is the solution to the general problem how to establish trust between two mutually unknown and otherwise unrelated parties to such an extent and certainty that sensitive and secure transactions can be performed with full confidence over an open environment, such as Internet. In all current large scale and not only financial systems that problem is solved by using the assistance of *third* *parties*. For many (may be even all) current Internet applications and transactions those third parties are integrated and linked into a large, complex, expensive and vulnerable operational infrastructures. Examples of such infrastructures today are bankcard networks supporting global international payments, global international banking networks supporting international financial transfers, PublicKey Infrastructures (PKI), Identity Management Systems, and many others. It is a general consent that such infrastructures are expensive and, more important, vulnerable to external and internal attacks. In addition to the complexity and vulnerabilities of such current operational supporting infrastructures, another requirement and prerequisite to use their services is that users must put the *complete trust* in these third parties. Accepting to trust those thirdparty service providers is the necessary and mandatory prerequisite to use their services. Therefore, one of the most important contributions of the concept of Bitcoin is that it solves the issue how two parties, mutually unknown to each other in advance and otherwise completely unrelated, can perform sensitive and secure transactions, such as transfer of money  payments, but without assistance of any third party and without the need to place trust in any component of the system. The practical benefits of solving this problem and the most important consequence of the solution for this problem  Bitcoin system, is that it provides the possibility for one Internet user to transfer not only Bitcoins, but also any other form of digital asset to or shared with another Internet user, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure, that everyone knows that the transfer has been performed, and nobody can challenge the legitimacy of the transfer. This feature of the Bitcoin system generated many very new, creative and innovative ideas where the concept equivalent to the Bitcoin can be used to perform secure and reliable transactions between users in an open community handling any type of digital asset (\[Andreesen, 2014\], \[Sparkes, 2014\], \[UniCredit, 2016\], \[BitID, 2015\], \[PoE, 2015\]). The examples of such applications and transactions range from commercial transitions, real estate transactions, energy trading, electronic voting, medical applications, and many others (\[Kounelis, 2015\], \[Muftic, 2016\]). The concept of blockchain as technology supporting validation of all such transactions is therefore called disruptive technology. As the conclusion in this section, we may give a definition of blockchain: Blockchain is an innovative *concept*, implemented as an *infrastructure* comprising multiple and distributed servers, mutually linked by special broadcasting and synchronization protocols, managing *immutable objects* with the purpose to *enable* and *protect* secure *peertopeer transactions* in a global and open environment. ## 1.4 Summary of Problems and Potential Solutions In section 1.2 several problems of the Bitcoin system were mentioned and potential solutions for these problems were outlined. Recently, at the time of writing this Technical Report, several sources, mainly personal blogs and articles, appeared with very interesting opinions and statements regarding some other serious Bitcoin problems. Some of them are problems with the concept of the system, some problems of its design, and some problems of operations. In this section some of these problems are briefly summarized including suggestions for their potential solutions. The source of some problems was the article \[Ein, 2018\]. **Problem 1:** Complex Crypto Algorithms *Problem*: Bitcoins is crypto currency and cryptographic algorithms used in the current version are very complex, based on the concept of proofofwork, and require long time, special hardware and a lots of energy to perform *Potential Solution*: Potential solution fro this problem is to use cryptographic algorithms that are simpler and therefore more efficient to execute and need less energy *Problems with Potential Solution*: Lowering the complexity of crypto algorithms introduces vulnerability to hackers. Therefore, what is needed are strong algorithms and simple to perform for regular users and complex to break by hackers **Problem 2:** Indirect Transactions, not PeertoPeer *Problem*: Contrary to the concept claimed, in todays implementation Bitcoin payment transactions are not performed as direct, peertopeer transactions. They are performed indirectly, submitted to the Bitcoin network, and recipients receive them indirectly, by downloading validated transactions from the ledger *Potential Solution*: Transactions should be performed directly, by transferring them directly between two users *Problems with Potential Solution*: The problem with the potential solution is validation of transaction for proof of possession of Bitcoins by the sender and for prevention of double-spending. Therefore, what is needed is the protocol to validate peertopeer transactions. **Problem 3:** Anonymity of Users not provided *Problem*: Contrary to the concept claimed, in todays deployments of additional system components, mainly exchanges, users are not anonymous *Potential Solution*: Blockchainbased Distributed Identity Management System with Role-based Authorizations *Problems with Potential Solution*: The problem with potential solution is that it depends on trusted third parties with authorized roles. Therefore, what is needed is blockchain-based Identity Management System using hybrid (permissioned and unpermissioned) blockchain **Problem 4:** Volatile Value, not suitable for Payments *Problem*: Contrary to the concept claimed that Bitcoin is payment system, volatile value of the currency makes it inconvenient for payments *Potential Solution*: Crypto currency with stable value *Problems with Potential Solution*: The problem with the potential solution is that the value of Bitcoins is determined on the secondary market, during its trading (cash-in / cash-out). Therefore, what is needed is crypto currency that does not have volatile value The remaining problems in this section are quoted from \[Ein, 2018\]: **Problem 5:** Negative Environmental Impact *Problem*: Mining algorithms and operational facilities (mining farms) consume too much electrical energy, based on the proof-of-work protocol *Potential Solution*: Using mining algorithms that consume less energy, either as simpler / lighter crypto algorithms or using alternative crypto protocols to protect transactions integrity (proof-of-stake) *Problems with Potential Solution*: The problem with the potential solution is that simpler / lighter algorithms open vulnerabilities to hackers while alternative crypto protocols are not backward compatible with the current system **Problem 6:** Slow Performance (Delays) / Low Throughput *Problem*: Due to blocking and the designed time for protection of transactions (10 minutes) Bitcoin system has very slow performance  transactions are validated in about an hour and transaction processing throughput is about 7 transactions per second *Potential Solution*: Using transaction validation algorithms and protocols that do not need blocking of transactions, but transactions should be validated individually *Problems with Potential Solution*: There are no serious problems with the proposed potential solution **Problem 7:** Limited Number of Bitcoins *Problem*: Due hardware and other types of failures, the number of available Bitcoins in the system is constantly reducing *Potential Solution*: Potential solution could be to use smaller portions of Bitcoin (Satoshi) or introduce hard-fork by splitting the amount of available Bitcoins *Problems with Potential Solution*: The problems with the first solution that it is not user-friendly and the problem with the second solution is backwards compatibility. **Problem 8:** Real Value of Bitcoins *Problem*: The value of Bitcoins is purely psychological and reflects only pure market speculations *Potential Solution*: Potential solution could be to peg the value of Bitcoin to local fiat currencies in countries of deployments *Problems with Potential Solution*: The problems with the potential solution is that such Bitcoins would be a new class of Bitcoins, not traded on exchanges and not volatile At the end of this section, it is very interesting to quote two opinions about the future of Bitcoin and blockchain: \[Ein, 2018\]: *It seems that Bitcoin will likely* ***cease to have meaningful value***\*, defeating the whole point and philosophy imagined by Satoshi Nakamoto, the alleged inventor of Bitcoin. Its current value appears to be purely psychological, and the hype seems to be driven by irrational exuberance, greed and speculation. Modern human history has seen many\* ***bubbles***\*, including the dot-com bubble, the housing bubble and even the tulip bubble. However, when these bubbles exploded, many excellent dot-com companies survived, most houses regained their value and tulips still have meaning and carry value in our lives today. But what will happen when the Bitcoin bubble bursts? What\* ***utility or residual value*** *will Bitcoin have to consumers and businesses? Most likely* ***none***\*. And this is the real problem with Bitcoin and crypto currencies.\* *Bitcoin will likely* ***go down in history*** *as a great technological invention that popularized blockchain yet* ***failed*** *due to its* ***design limitations***\*. Just like the industrial revolution was fueled by the combustion engine, Nakamotos most valuable contribution is the\* ***blockchain polymorphic engine*** *that will further accelerate innovation in the post-information age and immensely affect our lives.* This quote makes two very important and farreaching predictions: (1) Bitcoin, as the payment system will disappear (*. . .* *will go down in history*), and (2) The most valuable contribution of the Bitcoin system is blockchain This article was written in 2018. It is very interesting to notice that at the time of writing this Technical Report, (1) Bitcoin was still alive and (2) the concept and deployments of blockchain were in serious trouble. Based on the principle of positive and creative approach, in the rest of this Technical Report, besides description of all technical details of the Bitcoin system, some potential solutions for its improvement will also be discussed. However, contrary to the predicted status of Bitcoin, it seems that the predicted status of blockchain, in 2020 was still facing serious problems. \[Barber, 2019\]: What's Blockchain Actually Good for, Anyway? For Now, Not Much *Not long ago, blockchain technology was touted as a way to track tuna, bypass banks, and preserve property records. Reality has proved a much tougher challenge.* # [Lucanus, 2020]: Has Blockchain Failed Before It Even Really Began? *Just as everyone was getting really excited about its potential, it appears blockchain is dead. For a technology that was supposed to transform and solve seemingly every problem in the world, the enthusiasm is fading pretty quickly.* At the time of writing this Technical Report, there were many new blockchain  concepts, design and even several deployed and operational instances. Some of them are even very popular, but only among enthusiastic developers. The overall trends with real life deployments, and more and more comments about the capabilities and features of blockchains are appearing with negative connotation. Therefore, seems that even for blockchain some innovative concepts and approaches are needed. They are beyond the scope of this Technical Report and will be addressed in some of our follow-up reports."

Given a long enough time, eventually a group of corrupted politicians will win the election and take control over the country to enrich themselves. Bitcoin Cash gives you the freedom to move your wealth anywhere and relocate anytime to a safer haven. - Unlike fiat money, Bitcoin Cash cannot be counterfeited, so there is zero chance of you holding fake money. - If you were aware of the protests currently going on in Hong Kong, India, Iran, Chile, Bolivia, and other countries, you have to wonder how a minority government could suppress and control millions of citizens. Turns out if you have an unlimited money printing machine, you could control the entire nation. You could use it to pay for the police and military to beat up the civilians. You could use it to bribe the politicians to look the other way. You could use it to pay for propaganda campaigns. You could use it to invest in companies to prevent them from speaking up. When you remove their unlimited money printing machine, you also reduce their ability to suppress and control the people. Suddenly, the power shifts back into the peoples hands because nobody can print more Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cashs supply is fixed and there will only be 21 million Bitcoin Cash ever. - Bitcoin Cash allows you to bypass censorships because it is unstoppable peer to peer money. Benefits of Bitcoin Cash for Merchants - Zero chargebacks. - No more worries about credit card frauds. - No more worries about centralized payment systems such as PayPal freezing or stealing your money like what had happened to thousands of PayPal users. - Bitcoin Cash transactions are instant and safe because it does not have the RBF security vulnerability like Bitcoin Core. - No payment processing fee. 100% of the amount goes directly from the customer to the merchant. - Super easy to get started. Just install the Bitcoin.com Wallet and the Bitcoin Cash Register app and you can start accepting Bitcoin Cash payments within minutes. - Bitcoin Cash does not stigmatize or treat any businesses differently. If you run an organization that banks or governments may not like, you risk having your funds being confiscated anytime like what happened to the funds donated to help Hong Kong Protestors. Bitcoin Cash cannot be taken away by the banks nor the government without your permission."

12,vulnerability,btc,"Hayden Otto inadvertently publishes irrefutable on-chain proof that he excluded non-BCH retail revenue to shape the ""BCH #1 in Australia"" narrative.",1,eipd1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/eipd1y/hayden_otto_inadvertently_publishes_irrefutable/,2020-01-02 10:09:14,"*Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with any of the mentioned parties in a private or professional matter.* Presumably in an attempt to smear a local competitor, Hayden Otto inadvertently publishes irrefutable on-chain proof that he excluded non-BCH retail revenue to shape the ""BCH #1 in Australia"" narrative. - Scroll down to **""Proof of exclusion""** if you are tired of the drama recap. - Scroll down to **""TLDR""** if you want a summary. **** # Recap In September 2019, BitcoinBCH.com started publishing so called monthly ""reports"" about crypto retail payments in Australia. They claimed that **~90% of Australia's crypto retail revenue is processed via their own HULA system** and that **~92% of all crypto retail revenue happens in BCH**. They are aggregating two data sources to come up with this claim. One is **TravelByBit (TBB)** who *publishes* their PoS transactions (BTC, LN, ETH, BNB, DASH, BCH) live on a [ticker](URL The other source is **HULA**, a newly introduced POS system (BCH only) and direct competitor to TBB run by BitcoinBCH.com - the same company who created the report. Despite being on-chain their transactions are *private*, not published and not verifiable by third parties outside BitcoinBCH.com Two things stood out in the ""reports"", noted by multiple users (including vocal BCH proponents): - **The non-BCH parts must have tx excluded and the report neglects to mention it** (the total in their TBB analysis does not match what is reported on the TBB website.) - **The BCH part has outliers included** (e.g. BCH city conference in September with 35x the daily average) The TBB website loads the historic tx data in the browser but hides transactions older than 7 days from being displayed, i.e. you can access more than 7 days worth of data if you understand JavaScript and can read the source code [source](URL # Hayden Otto's reaction In direct response to me publishing these findings on r/btc, Hayden Otto - an employee at BitcoinBCH.com and the author of the report who also happens to be a moderator of /r/BitcoinCash - banned me immediately from said sub ([source](URL In subsequent discussion (which repeated for every monthly ""report"" which was flawed in the same ways as described above), Hayden responded using the same tactics: *** **""No data was removed""** &gt; ""The guy is straight out lying. There is guaranteed no missing tx as the data was collected directly from the source."" ([source](URL **** **""Only data I considered non-retail was removed""** &gt; ""I also had these data points and went through them to remove non-retail transactions, on both TravelbyBit and HULA."" ([source](URL He admits to have removed non-BCH tx by ""Game Ranger"" because he considers them non-retail ([source](URL He also implies they might be involved in money laundering and that TBB might fail their AML obligations in processing Game Ranger's transactions ([source](URL The report does not mention any data being excluded at all and he still fails to explain why several businesses that are clearly retail (e.g. restaurants, cafes, markets) had tx excluded ([source](URL **** **""You are too late to prove I altered the data""** &gt; ""[...] I recorded [the data] manually from URL over the month of September. The website only shows transactions from the last 7 days **and then they disappear. No way for anyone to access stats beyond that.** ([source]( URL ))"" Fortunately you can, if you can read the website's source code. But you need to know a bit of JavaScript to verify it yourself, so not an ideal method to easily prove the claim of data exclusion to the public. But it laters turns out Hayden himself has found an easier way to achieve the same. *** **""The report can't be wrong because it has been audited.""** In response to criticism about the flawed methodology in generating the September report, BitcoinBCH.com hired an accountant from a regional Bitcoin BCH startup to ""audit"" the October report. This is remarkable, because not only did their reported TBB totals still not match those from the TBB site - their result was mathematically impossible. How so? No subset of TBB transaction in that month sums up to the total they reported. So even if they excluded retail transactions at will, they still must have messed up the sum ([source](URL Why didn't their auditor notice their mistake? She said she ""conducted a review based on the TravelByBit data **provided to her**"", i.e. the data acquisition and selection process was **explicitly excluded from the audit** ([source](URL *** **""You are a 'pathetic liar', a 'desperate toll', an 'astroturf account' and 'a total dumb ass' and are 'pulling numbers out of your ass!'""** Since he has already banned me from the sub he moderates, he started to resort to ad hominems ([source](URL [source](URL [source](URL [source](URL # Proof of exclusion I published raw data as extracted from the TBB site after each report for comparison. Hayden responded that I made those numbers up and that I [was pulling numbers out of my ass](URL Since he was under the impression that &gt; ""The website only shows transactions from the last 7 days **and then they disappear. No way for anyone to access stats beyond that.**"" ([source](URL )) he felt confident to claim that I am unable &gt; to provide a source for the [missing] data and/or prove that that data was not already included in the report. ([source]( URL Luckily for us Hayden Otto seems to dislike his competitor TravelByBit so much that he attempted to reframe Bitcoin's RBF feature as a vulnerability specific to TBB PoS system ([source](URL While doublespending a merchant using the TBB PoS he wanted to prove that the merchant successfully registered the purchase as complete and thus revealed that **the PoS sales history of TBB's merchants are available to the public** ([source](URL in his own words: &gt; ""You can literally access it from a public URL in the Web browser. There is no login or anything required, just type in the name of the merchant."" ([source](URL As of yet it is unclear if this is intentional by TBB or if Hayden Ottos followed the rules of responsible disclosure before publishing this kind of data leak. As it happens, those sale histories do not only include the merchant and time of purchases, they **even include the address the funds were sent to (in case of on-chain payments)**. This gives us an easy method to prove that the purchases from the TBB website missing in the reports belong to a specific retail business and actually happened - something that is impossible to prove for the alleged HULA txs. In order to make it easier for you to verify it yourself, we'll focus on a single day in the dataset, **September 17th, 2019** as an example: - Hayden Otto's report claims **20 tx and $713.00** in total for that day ([source](URL - The TBB website listed **40 tx and a total of $1032.90** ([daily summary](URL - Pick a merchant, e.g. ""The Stand Desserts"" - Use Hayden's ""trick"" to access that merchants public sale history at URL sort by date to find the 17th Sep 2019 and look for a transaction at 20:58 for $28. This proves that a purchase of said amount is associated with this specific retail business. - Paste the associated crypto on-chain address `17MrHiRcKzCyuKPtvtn7iZhAZxydX8raU9` in a blockchain explorer of your choice, e.g like [this](URL This proves that a transfer of funds has actually happened. I let software aggregate the TBB statistics with the public sale histories and here you'll find at the bottom a table with the on-chain adresses conveniently linked to blockchain explorers for our example date. The total of **all 40 tx is $1032.90** instead of the $713.00 reported by Hayden. 17 tx of those have a corresponding on-chain address and thus have undeniable proof of $758.10. Of the remaining 23, 22 are on Lightning and one had no merchant history available. This is just for a single day, here is a comparison for the whole month. | Description | Total | | - | - | | TBB Total | $10,502| | TBB wo. Game Ranger|$5,407| | TBB according to Hayden|$3,737| # What now? The usual shills will respond in a predictive manner: The data must be fake even though its proof is on-chain, I would need to provide more data but HULA can be trusted without any proof, if you include outliers BCH comes out ahead, yada, yada. But this is not important. I am not here to convince them and this post doesn't aim to. The tx numbers we are talking about are less than 0.005% of Bitcoin's global volume. If you can increase adoption in your area by 100% by just buying 2 coffees more per day you get a rough idea about how irrelevant the numbers are in comparison. What is relevant though and what this post aims to highlight is that BitcoinBCH.com and the media outlets around news.bitcoin.com flooding you with the BCH #1 narrative are playing dirty. They feel justified because they feel that Bitcoin/Core/Blockstream is playing dirty as well. I am not here to judge that but you as a reader of this sub should be aware that this is happening and that you are the target. When BitcoinBCH.com excludes $1,000 Bitcoin tx because of high value but includes $15,000 BCH tx because they are made by ""professionals"", you should be sceptical. When BitcoinBCH.com excludes game developers, travel businesses or craftsmen accepting Bitcoin because they don't have a physical store but include a lawyer practice accepting BCH, you should be sceptical. When BitcoinBCH.com excludes restaurants, bars and supermarkets accepting Bitcoin and when pressed reiterate that they excluded **non-retail** businesses without ever explaning why a restaurant shouldn't be considered reatil, you should be sceptical. When BitcoinBCH.com claims the reports have been audited but omit that the data acquisition was not part of the audit, you should be sceptical. I expect that BitcoinBCH.com will stop removing transactions from TBB for their reports now that it has been shown that their exclusion can be provably uncovered. I also expect that HULA's BCH numbers will rise accordingly to maintain a similar difference. Hayden Otto assumed that nobody could cross-check the TBB data. He was wrong. Nobody will be able to disprove his claims when HULA's BCH numbers rise as he continues to refuse their release. You should treat his claims accordingly. As usual, do your own research and draw your own conclusion. Sorry for the long read. # TLDR - BitcoinBCH.com claimed no transactions were removed from the TBB dataset in their BCH #1 reports and that is impossible to prove the opposite. - Hayden Otto's reveals in a double spend attempt that a TBB merchant's sale history can be accessed publicly including the merchant's on-chain addresses. - This table shows 40 tx listed on the TBB site on sep 17th, including their on-chain addresses where applicable. - The BitcoinBCH.com report lists only 20 tx for the same day. | No. | Date | Merchant | Asset | Address | Amount | Total | | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | | 1 | 17 Sep 19 09:28 | LTD Espresso | Lightning | Unable to find merchant history. | 4.50 | 4.50 | | 2 | 17 Sep 19 09:40 | LTD Espresso | Binance Coin | Unable to find merchant history. | 4.50 | 9.00 | | 3 | 17 Sep 19 13:22 | [Josh's IGA Murray Bridge West](URL | Ether | [0x40fd53aa...b6de43c531](URL | 4.60 | 13.60 | | 4 | 17 Sep 19 13:23 | [Nom Nom Korean Eatery](URL | Lightning | lnbc107727...zkcqvvgklf | 16.00 | 29.60 | | 5 | 17 Sep 19 13:24 | [Nom Nom Korean Eatery](URL | Lightning | lnbc100994...mkspwddgqw | 15.00 | 44.60 | | 6 | 17 Sep 19 14:02 | [Nom Nom Korean Eatery](URL | Binance Coin | [bnb1w5mwu9...552thl4ru5](URL | 30.00 | 74.60 | | 7 | 17 Sep 19 15:19 | [Dollars and Sense (Fortitude Valley)](URL | Lightning | lnbc134780...93cpanyxfg | 2.00 | 76.60 | | 8 | 17 Sep 19 15:34 | [Steph's Cafe](URL | Binance Coin | [bnb124hcjy...ss3pz9y3r8](URL | 57.50 | 134.10 | | 9 | 17 Sep 19 19:37 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Binance Coin | [bnb13f58s9...qqc7fxln7s](URL | 18.00 | 152.10 | | 10 | 17 Sep 19 19:59 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc575880...48cpl0z06q | 8.50 | 160.60 | | 11 | 17 Sep 19 20:00 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc575770...t8spzjflym | 8.50 | 169.10 | | 12 | 17 Sep 19 20:13 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc202980...lgqp5ha8f4 | 3.00 | 172.10 | | 13 | 17 Sep 19 20:21 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc577010...decq7r4p05 | 8.50 | 180.60 | | 14 | 17 Sep 19 20:24 | [Fat Dumpling](URL | Lightning | lnbc217145...9dsqpjjr6g | 32.10 | 212.70 | | 15 | 17 Sep 19 20:31 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc574530...wvcpp3pcen | 8.50 | 221.20 | | 16 | 17 Sep 19 20:33 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc540660...rpqpzgk8z0 | 8.00 | 229.20 | | 17 | 17 Sep 19 20:37 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc128468...r8cqq50p5c | 19.00 | 248.20 | | 18 | 17 Sep 19 20:39 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc135220...cngp2zq6q4 | 2.00 | 250.20 | | 19 | 17 Sep 19 20:45 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc574570...atcqg738p8 | 8.50 | 258.70 | | 20 | 17 Sep 19 20:51 | [Fat Dumpling](URL | Lightning | lnbc414190...8hcpg79h9a | 61.20 | 319.90 | | 21 | 17 Sep 19 20:53 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc135350...krqqp3cz8z | 2.00 | 321.90 | | 22 | 17 Sep 19 20:58 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Bitcoin | [17MrHiRcKz...ZxydX8raU9](URL | 28.00 | 349.90 | | 23 | 17 Sep 19 21:02 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Bitcoin | [1Hwy8hCBff...iEh5fBsCWK](URL | 10.00 | 359.90 | | 24 | 17 Sep 19 21:03 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc743810...dvqqnuunjq | 11.00 | 370.90 | | 25 | 17 Sep 19 21:04 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc114952...2vqpclm87p | 17.00 | 387.90 | | 26 | 17 Sep 19 21:10 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc169160...lpqqqt574c | 2.50 | 390.40 | | 27 | 17 Sep 19 21:11 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc575150...40qq9yuqmy | 8.50 | 398.90 | | 28 | 17 Sep 19 21:13 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc947370...qjcp3unr33 | 14.00 | 412.90 | | 29 | 17 Sep 19 21:15 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Binance Coin | [bnb1tc2vva...xppes5t7d0](URL | 16.00 | 428.90 | | 30 | 17 Sep 19 21:16 | [Giardinetto](URL | Binance Coin | [bnb1auyep2...w64p6a6dlk](URL | 350.00 | 778.90 | | 31 | 17 Sep 19 21:25 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | BCH | [3H2iJaKNXH...5sxPk3t2tV](URL | 7.00 | 785.90 | | 32 | 17 Sep 19 21:39 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Binance Coin | [bnb17r7x3e...avaxwumc58](URL | 8.00 | 793.90 | | 33 | 17 Sep 19 21:47 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | BCH | [32kuPYT1tc...uFQwgsA5ku](URL | 18.00 | 811.90 | | 34 | 17 Sep 19 21:52 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | BCH | [3ELPvxtCSy...4QzvfVJsNZ](URL | 36.00 | 847.90 | | 35 | 17 Sep 19 21:56 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc677740...acsp04sjeg | 10.00 | 857.90 | | 36 | 17 Sep 19 22:04 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | BCH | [38b4wHg9cg...9L2WXC2BSK](URL | 54.00 | 911.90 | | 37 | 17 Sep 19 22:16 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Binance Coin | [bnb14lylhs...x6wz7kjzp5](URL | 18.00 | 929.90 | | 38 | 17 Sep 19 22:21 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | BCH | [3L8SK3Hr7u...F3htdSPxfL](URL | 90.00 | 1019.90 | | 39 | 17 Sep 19 22:30 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Binance Coin | [bnb19w6tle...774uknv57t](URL | 5.00 | 1024.90 | | 40 | 17 Sep 19 22:48 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | BCH | [3Qag8c4UYg...9EYuWzGjhs](URL | 8.00 | 1032.90 |"

With Replace-By-Fee in bitcoin core, when the public key is cracked in the mempool, funds can be stolen. All the attacker has to do is to use the private key to broadcast a transaction to himself with a higher mining fee, and the coins are his. Unless this is changed, BTC will be rendered completely useless in a post quantum world. Unlike bitcoin core, bitcoin (BCH) uses the first seen rule, so it will not have the same vulnerability. Also, double spend proofs are coming to bitcoin rather soon, making it nearly impossible to pull off a double spend."

At this stage it has become abundantly clear that LN is not safe to use at this time, and anyone that uses it is at a very high risk of losing funds.

16,vulnerability,btc,How the Bitcoin Halvening could bring the miners back in charge,1,do8hw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/do8hw9/how_the_bitcoin_halvening_could_bring_the_miners/,2019-10-28 23:59:33,"Today I was reading a post over at r/cryptocurrency where some guy believes Bitcoin Cash is in a ""death spiral"". While the post there is pure fantasy, the theory of a death spiral is fascinating to me. It is the only way to stop a blockchain without attacking it. The bitcoin core (BTC) halvening at block #630,000 (May 2020) will be different than previous halvenings: * at the last halvening in July 2016 the bitcoin blocks were not full yet (full blocks and high fees started in 2017) -&gt; this combined with the legacy DAA has introduced a new vulnerability exclusive to BTC - the so called ""death spiral"" * it will be the first halvening after the miners have been tricked, by a guy who would rather see merchants use tabs instead of bitcoin, into restricting themselves to mine 1 MB blocks forever -&gt; I don't know how much of the miners are still pissed, but we know that lots of them support BCH and some even hold large amounts of Bitcoin Cash * it is the first halvening where ASICs can be used on another chain as long as there has been no difficulty adjustment on BTC yet, previously it was just a question if you would shut down (depending on operating costs) and let others clear until the DAA. The legacy difficulty adjustment algorithm changes the target every 2016 blocks (2 weeks at perfect 10 minute block times). At the last halvening it took almost a month for the difficulty to drop (5.7.2016 - 2.8.2016). So if the BTC-USD price would stay the same and the BTC-BCH price also stays the same it would mean 20 minute block times over 4 weeks. If 50% of BTC hashrate switches away it would possibly mean 40 minute block times over 2 months. This would lead to transaction fees atleast 4 times as high - but it wont bring back miners to collect fees. It doesn't make a difference if you collect 1 BTC in fees with 4 blocks in 40 minutes or 1 BTC in fees with a single block in 40 minutes. At this point the death spiral becomes a real possibility, even one or two hours without a block could lead to fear in the market. A significant price drop of BTC or price increase of BCH would be devastating at this point. More miners would switch and several hour block times with huge transaction fees would make it obvious to everyone why some of us called it cripple coin all along. Only a hardfork could save BTC and start the block generation again. While this can hardly be considered an attack be people who think for themselves, we know that most people don't think for themselves and will fall for Blockstreams Spin-Doctors. So I hope the percentage of unknown miners will further increase. Miners were not supposed to sit down on tables and make agreements with people who profit from crippling bitcoin anyway."

That, and the bitcointalk forum. The history of what happened has been well documented with sources in places like [here](URL and [here](URL The TLDR is * ""Theymos"" gains control of r\/bitcoin and bitcointalk * Theymos receives a 6000 BTC donation (worth in the low millions of dollars at the time) to develop new forum software.

Throughout all of this, Blockstream steadfastly argued that it didn't control the Bitcoin Core software. Blockstream pointed to Chaincode Labs who funded several key bitcoin developers and the MIT Media Labs ""Digital Currency Initiative"" who funded Gavin, Cory, and Wladimir. Gavin and Wladimir in particular had the authority to merge changes into the Bitcoin Core software and as such effectively could decide what did and did not go into the software. As an ostensibly academic organization, Gavin and Wladimir etc could act with intellectual honesty and without coercion. Except Gavin left the Digital Currency Initiative in 2017, saying that while he wasn't pressured to quit, he ""[didn't want to feel obligated to any person or organization](URL Fast forward to 2019, and we learn the fascinating news that the MIT Media Labs were funded in part by none other than Jeffrey Epstein, [who it turns out just so happened to be a staunch advocate of the Blockstream approach](URL So really, Bitcoin development was corralled: Blockstream was paying a bunch of devs, and Blockstream-Friendly MIT Media Labs were paying the others. ___ If you're still reading this, you probably wonder what it is about the Blockstream strategy that is so ""bad."" Aren't they just proposing a different way to solve Bitcoin's problems? The original idea for Bitcoin was a ""peer to peer cash system"" - - the idea being that if Alice wants to buy something from Bob, she can just give him some tokens - - just like cash. The new vision of bitcoin promoted by Blockstream and Core is ""store of value"". Under this model, you buy Bitcoins like you might speculate on gold - you buy some and you hold it. Later, if you want to purchase something, you sell your Bitcoins for some other payment method (or use an IOU against a deposit, just like a bank), and use that for purchases. It should be apparent after a moment of thought that the original concept (Alice hands Bob some cash which Bob can then spend how he likes) is vastly more disruptive than the model in which Alice buys Bitcoin on a government-regulated exchange, holds them hoping they'll appreciate in value, and then sells them for Euros or dollars. In model one, the currency is essentially outside the domain of gatekeepers, and could completely disintermediate the entire existing financial system just like Napster for money. In model two, Bitcoin is no more disruptive than shares of a gold fund."

These crypto wallets usually depend on the phone's encryption rather then depending on a good passphrase decryption. So even if it's encrypted with a PIN on top of the device encryption, bruteforcing 4 or 6 digit PIN is a lot easier then let's say a passphrase I use to encrypt a Electron Cash wallet file. There is an insanely big market for used iOs devices. When your device got stolen and it was icloud locked, at least you could feel good about the thief having a hard time trying to sell it. But now it's only a matter of time before all these stolen devices can be unlocked from their icloud lock and sold. This also means that criminals could put themselves in a position where lots of used ios devices flow through their hands and eventually use this to install code that will lurk and forward any future priv key put on the device.

24,vulnerability,btc,Changelly vs ShapeShift,0,cjvpp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/cjvpp5/changelly_vs_shapeshift/,2019-07-31 04:15:39,"Instant exchange is a popular way to trade cryptocurrencies quickly and efficiently. In our next few articles, we will try to compare and evaluate the most popular exchangers at the moment. Today, Changelly and ShapeShift are still pretty popular services for these purposes. However, before using this or that exchanger, each cryptocurrency trader needs to weigh all the pros and cons. In this comparative review, we compare Changelly ShapeShift and go through some of their key similarities and differences, according to the safety criteria, the commission, options for different cryptocurrencies and the user interface. **User interface** First, let's look at a couple of Changelly and ShapeShift in terms of user interface. This is the first impression that a trader who uses an exchanger gets. Changelly interface is one of the most straightforward and easy-to-use interfaces among all cryptocurrency exchangers. For example, on Changelly you do not need to go to a new page to look at the trading options and calculate the exchange rate: all this information is at the top of the main page. Naturally, before you participate in the auction you will have to register. In addition, for their services, Changelly can sometimes take a significant commission. Previously, ShapeShift exchanger was known as an exchanger without accounts. However, in September 2018, the developers decided to change the model of the platform to give users additional protection and reduce friction. Now, to trade on ShapeShift, you will have to register. Compared to Changelly, for beginners, ShapeShift may seems more complicated exchanger. On its main page, a pop-up window ""account required to participate in the auction"" appears, which also describes all the advantages. After closing this window, you will find yourself on the statistics page, where you can see a variety of indicators. For example, you can look at recent transactions. Also on the homepage there is a 24-hour statistics of the number of transactions and BTC volume, the average order processing time and the most popular trading pairs. **Security** On its website Changelly stores no user funds. Instead, the exchanger sends funds directly to your wallet. It makes Changelly, not the custodian exchanger, which is usually safer than a conventional exchange, which holds users' funds. In addition, Changelly uses two-factor authentication (2FA). In May 2017, one of Changelly's supporting accounts was hacked. Some users received the following message: ""All customers who make an exchange from Bitcoin to another currency must manually transfer to the specified Bitcoin address:..."". However, Changelly support immediately blocked this account. ShapeShift, in turn, once used hot wallets on its website. It is unclear whether they can be used now, but users still remember the past vulnerability of the platform. In April 2016, ShapeShift exchanger was hacked and lost $200,000. Here's a comment from CEO Eric Voorhees himself: ""the server Infrastructure was compromised and was under serious threat. We decided to quickly wipe out this infrastructure and build a completely new and secure environment."" It is important to note that in the course of this, no customer has lost their money. The only funds lost belonged to the company itself. ShapeShift representatives called their own employee responsible for the incident. **Commissions** ShapeShift has quite a good commission for an instant exchanger. For each transaction, they take only a commission for mining. Some argue that this commission is somewhat overstated compared to the standard commission on mining, on which the platform earns. Anyway, for one transaction you will pay no more than 0.5 %. ShapeShift does not return funds after failed transactions if the amount of lost assets is less than the mining commission. If you sent the cryptocurrency to the wrong address (for example, to GNT instead of ETH address), the platform will charge you a refund fee in the equivalent of 50 euros at the current rate. As in ShapeShift, Changellys commission is approximately 0.5 %. However, many Changelly users notice that the exchanger has ""hidden fees"", but basically it isnt, it is a result of high rate volatility of cryptocurrencies. For example, when you enter your existing funds (for example, USD), the amount transferred to another currency (for example, BTC) may differ from the current rate. And sometimes the resulting amount is the same as specified on the exchange. This should be taken into account when trading if you do not want to lose a small part of your funds. Although you should do this all the time in all exchangers. **The choice of currencies** Of course, the main advantage of both ShapeShift and Changelly is the variety of trading pairs. For example, you can easily exchange Qtum to Aragon directly instead of first changing Qtum to Bitcoin and then Bitcoin to Aragon, as is required on most other platforms. If we talk about the most obvious differences between Changelly and ShapeShift, it is worth considering the availability of exchange to the ordinary money. In the exchanger ShapeShift there is not a single fiat currency. Instead, ShapeShift collaborates with Simplex to provide its users with this capability. However, even considering this partnership, your choice is limited to BTC-USD and BTC-EUR trading pairs. About 33 cryptocurrencies are available on ShapeShift. There are several other cryptocurrencies marked as ""temporarily unavailable"", which may limit the use of the platform for some users. On the other hand, Changelly offers a large selection of trading crypto pairs (over 90) for USD and EUR. Also, this exchanger allows the use of debit and credit cards (Visa or Mastercard). **Geographic and transaction limits** ShapeShift and Changelly doesnt have any restrictions at the place of stay. Users from all over the world are free to use both projects. This is good news, especially given the fact that now many exchanges can not boast of such accessibility. If you are going to change large amounts, you need to take into account that each exchanger has its own limitations. ShapeShift has a relatively low transaction limit of $10,000 for level 1 users. By participating in the exchange, you can extend these limits. As of November 2018, higher levels (2-5) are not available to those who are not members of the community. The maximum limits of Changelly are from $ 50 to $ 10 000 for the first transaction, up to $ 20 000 per day and up to $ 50 000 per month. **Conclusion** So which exchanger, after all, is better? Having studied all these criteria, we can say that Changelly is slightly ahead of ShapeShift in its parameters. However, if the commission is extremely important for you, it is possible that ShapeShift will suit you more. It is also important to note that ShapeShift added a membership program in September 2018. As for Changelly, the exchanger continues to announce new partnership agreements with companies in the blockchain and crypto field. Further actions such as integration with various payment applications will help Changelly expand its user base and affect the future mass distribution of the platform."

The initiation of the attack fell on November 4, 2014. Then Damian Merlak, the CTO of the exchange, was offered free tickets to punk rock festival Punk Rock Holiday 2015 via Skype, knowing that Merlak is interested in such music and he plays in the band. To receive the tickets, he was asked to fill out a participant questionnaire by sending a file named Punk Rock Holiday 2015 TICKET Form1.doc. This file contained the VBA script. By opening the file, he downloaded the malware on his computer. Although Merlak did not suspect wrong and has opened the ""application form"", to any critical consequences, this did not open access to the funds of exchange. The attackers, however, did not give up. The attack continued for five weeks, during which hackers presented themselves as journalists, then headhunters. Finally, the attackers were lucky. On December 11, 2014, the infected word document was opened on his machine by Bitstamp system administrator Luka Kodric, who had access to the exchange wallet. The file came to the victim by email, allegedly on behalf of an employee of the Association for computer science, although in fact, as the investigation showed, the traces of the file lead deep into Tor. Hackers were not limited to just one letter. Skype attacker pretending to be an employee of the Association for computing machinery, convinced that his Frame though to make international honor society, which required some paperwork. Kodric believed. By installing a Trojan on Kodri's computer hackers were able to obtain direct access to the hot wallet of the exchange. The logs show that the attacker, under the account of Kodric, gained access to the server LNXSRVBTC, where he kept the wallet file.dat, and the DORNATA server where the password was stored. Then the servers were redirected to a certain IP address that belongs to one of the providers of Germany. There are still no official reports of arrests in this case. Obviously, the case is complicated by the fact that the hackers are outside the UK, and the investigation has to cooperate with law enforcement agencies in other countries. **2. GateHub $9.5 mln (XRP), June 1th, 2019** Hackers have compromised nearly 100 XRP Ledger wallets on cryptocurrency wallet service GateHub. The incident was reported by GateHub in a preliminary statement on June 6. XRP enthusiast Thomas Silkjr, who first noticed the suspicious activity, estimates that the hackers have stolen nearly $10 million worth of cryptocurrency (23,200,000 XRP), $5.5 million (13,100,000 XRP) of which has already been laundered through exchanges and mixer services. GateHub notes that it is still conducting an investigation and therefore cannot publish any official findings. Also, GateHub advises victims to make complaints to the relevant authorities of their jurisdiction. **3. Tether, $30.9 mln (USDT), November 19th, 2017** Tether created a digital currency called ""US tokens"" (USDT)  they could be used to trade real goods using Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ether. By depositing $1 in Tether, the user received 1 USD, which can be converted back into fiat. On November 19, 2017, the attacker gained access to the main Tether wallet and withdrew $ 30.9 million in tokens. For the transaction, he used a Bitcoin address, which means that it was irreversible. To fix the situation, Tether took action by which the hacker was unable to withdraw the stolen money to fiat or Bitcoin, but the panic led to a decrease in the value of Bitcoin. **4. Ethereum, $31 mln (ETH), July 20th, 2017** On July 20, 2017, the hacker transferred 153,037 Ethers to $31 million from three very large wallets owned by SwarmCity, Edgeless Casino and Eternity. Unknown fraudster managed to change the ownership of wallets, taking advantage of the vulnerability with multiple signatures. First, the theft was noticed by the developers of SwarmCity. Further events deserve a place in history: ""white hackers"" returned the stolen funds, and then protected other compromised accounts. They acted in the same way as criminals, who stole funds from vulnerable wallets  just not for themselves. And it all happened in less than a day. **5. Dao (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) $70 mln (ETH), June 18th, 2016** On June 18, 2016, members of the Ethereum community noticed that funds were being drained from the DAO and the overall ETH balance of the smart contract was going down. A total of 3.6 million Ether (worth around $70 million at the time) was drained by the hacker in the first few hours. The attack was possible because of an exploit found in the splitting function. The attacker/s withdrew Ether from the DAO smart contract multiple times using the same DAO Tokens. This was possible due to what is known as a recursive call exploit. In this exploit, the attacker was able to ""ask"" the smart contract (DAO) to give the Ether back multiple times before the smart contract could update its own balance. There were two main faults that made this possible: the fact that when the DAO smart contract was created the coders did not take into account the possibility of a recursive call, and the fact that the smart contract first sent the ETH funds and then updated the internal token balance. It's important to understand that this bug did not come from Ethereum itself, but from this one application that was built on Ethereum. The code written for the DAO had multiple bugs, and the recursive call exploit was one of them. Another way to look at this situation is to compare Ethereum to the Internet and any application based on Ethereum to a website: if a website is not working, it doesn't mean that the Internet is not working, it simply means that one website has a problem. The hacker stopped draining the DAO for unknown reasons, even though they could have continued to do so. The Ethereum community and team quickly took control of the situation and presented multiple proposals to deal with the exploit. In order to prevent the hacker from cashing in the Ether from his child DAO after the standard 28 days, a soft-fork was voted on and came very close to being introduced. A few hours before it was set to be released, a few members of the community found a bug with the implementation that opened a denial-of-service attack vector. This soft fork was designed to blacklist all the transactions made from the DAO. **6. NiceHash, 4736.42 (BTC), December 6th, 2017** NiceHash is a Slovenian cryptocurrency hash power broker with integrated marketplace that connects sellers of hashing power (miners) with buyers of hashing power using the sharing economy approach. On December 6, 2017, the company's servers became the target of attack. At first, Reddit users reported that they could not access their funds and make transactions  when they tried to log in, they were shown a message about a service interruption. In the end, it became known that the service had undergone a major cyberattack and 4736,42 Bitcoins disappeared without a trace. Despite heavy losses, NiceHash was able to continue working, but CEO and founder Marco Koval resigned, giving way to a new team. The company managed to maintain the trust of investors and began to strengthen the protection of its systems. **7. Mt.Gox, 850000 (BTC), June 19th, 2011** The Hacking Of Mt.Gox was one of the biggest Bitcoin thefts in history. It was the work of highly professional hackers using complex vulnerabilities. A hacker (or a group of hackers) allegedly gained access to a computer owned by one of the auditors and used a security vulnerability to access Mt.Gox servers, then changed the nominal value of Bitcoin to 1 cent per coin. Then they brought out about 2000 BTC. Some customers, without knowing it, conducted transactions at this low price, a total of 650 BTC, and despite the fact that the hacking hit the headlines around the world, no Bitcoin could be returned. To increase investor confidence, the company has compensated all of the stolen coins, placed most of the remaining funds in offline storage, and the next couple of years was considered the most reliable Bitcoin exchanger in the world. However, it was only an illusion of reliability. The problems of the organization were much more serious, and the management probably did not even know about them. CEO of Mt.Gox, Mark Karpeles, was originally a developer, but over time he stopped delving into technical details, basking in the rays of glory  because he created the world's largest platform for cryptocurrency exchange. At that time Mt.Gox handled over 70% of all Bitcoin transactions. And, of course, there were those who wanted to take advantage of the technological weakness of the service. At some point, hackers made it so that Bitcoins could be bought at any price, and within minutes millions of dollars worth of coins were sold  mostly for pennies. World prices for Bitcoin stabilized in a few minutes, but it was too late. As a result, Mt.Gox lost about 850,000 Bitcoins. The exchange had to declare bankruptcy, hundreds of thousands of people lost money, and the Japanese authorities arrested CEO Mark Karpeles for fraud. He pleaded not guilty and was subsequently released. In 2014, the authorities restored some of the Bitcoins remaining at the old addresses, but did not transfer them to the exchange, and created a trust to compensate for the losses of creditors. **8. Coincheck, $530 mln, January 26th, 2018** The sum was astonishing, and even surpassed the infamous Mt.Gox hack. While Mt.Gox shortly filed for bankruptcy following the hack, Coincheck has surprisingly remained in business and was even recently approved as a licensed exchange by Japans Financial Services (FSA). Coincheck was founded in 2014 in Japan and was one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. Offering a wide variety of digital assets including Bitcoin, Ether, LISK, and NEM, Coincheck was an emerging exchange that joined the Japan Blockchain Association. Since Coincheck was founded it 2014, it was incidentally not subject to new exchange registration requirements with Japans FSA  who rolled out a framework after Mt. Gox , and eventually was a contributing factor to its poor security standards that led to the hack. On January 26th, 2018, Coincheck posted on their blog detailing that they were restricting NEM deposits and withdrawals, along with most other methods for buying or selling cryptocurrencies on the platform. Speculation arose that the exchange had been hacked, and the NEM developers issued a statement saying they were unaware of any technical glitches in the NEM protocol and any issues were a result of the exchanges security. Coincheck subsequently held a high-profile conference where they confirmed that hackers had absconded with 500 million NEM tokens that were then distributed to 19 different addresses on the network. Totaling roughly $530 million at the time  NEM was hovering around $1 then  the Coincheck hack was considered the largest theft in the industrys history. Coincheck was compelled to reveal some embarrassing details about their exchanges security, mentioning how they stored all of the NEM in a single hot wallet and did not use the NEM multisignature contract security recommended by the developers. Simultaneously, the NEM developers team had tagged all of the NEM stolen in the hack with a message identifying the funds as stolen so that other exchanges would not accept them. However, NEM announced they were ending their hunt for the stolen NEM for unspecified reasons several months later, and speculation persisted that hackers were close to cashing out the stolen funds on the dark web. Mainstream media covered the hack extensively and compared it to similar failures by cryptocurrency exchanges in the past to meet adequate security standards. At the time, most media coverage of cryptocurrencies was centered on their obscure nature, dramatic volatility, and lack of security. Coinchecks hack fueled that narrative considerably as the stolen sum was eye-popping and the cryptocurrency used  NEM  was unknown to most in the mainstream. NEM depreciated rapidly following the hack, and the price fell even more throughout 2018, in line with the extended bear market in the broader industry. Currently, NEM is trading at approximately $0.07, a precipitous fall from ATH over $1.60 in early January. The extent of the Coincheck hack was rivaled by only a few other hacks, notably the Mt.Gox hack. While nominally Coincheck is the largest hack in the industrys history, the effects of Mt.Gox were significantly more impactful since the stolen funds consisted only of Bitcoin and caused a sustained market correction as well as an ongoing controversy with the stolen funds and founder. Moreover, Mt.Gox squandered 6% of the overall Bitcoin circulation at the time in a market that was much less mature than it is today. Despite the fallout, Coincheck is now fully operational and registered with Japans FSA. As practice shows, people make mistakes and these mistakes can cost a lot. Especially, when we talk about mad cryptoworld. Be careful and keep your private keys in a safe place."

It's worth re-iterating: the exploit had nothing to do with the hard-fork. The attackers simply sat on an old vulnerability for months, waiting to exploit it at the same time as the hard-fork. This exploit required expertise to discover. Whoever was behind this attack is either a security researcher themselves, or they've hired security researchers. This type of expertise isn't cheap. Regardless of how well-funded this attack was, it has proven to be an abysmal failure. Within hours, miners have patched their nodes, and the network is operating normally again.

I'm still not sure Craig is a totally useless conman, but I think the negatives of having him in the community, to the extent we have any say over it, are definitely outweighing the positives at this point. My rough estimation of the positives as I see them: 1. I still think it's possible he was part of team Satoshi or at least involved very early on. He seems to have some insights others don't wrt to the pre-history of the bitcoin idea. 2. I still like his focus on business adoption, professionalization of the industry, and support of companies with very practical uses outside the immediate circle of crypto fans (Handcash, Moneybutton; still don't get Centbee). 3. I like his focus on economics and incentive issues in addition to technical issues, which is why, I think, people I respect, like Daniel Krawisz, still respect him. 4. Some people I respect, albeit admittedly seemingly from the somewhat less technical side seem to have gained valuable insight about bitcoin from him. I don't think he's a total buffoon in terms of overall understanding even if his technical knowledge isn't there. It seems like he's had some unique insights of his own, like the idea of Bitcoin as a small-world network. 5. I don't like IP, but figured I'd rather have a BCH-friendly corporation holding crypto patents than Bank of America. I like that Coingeek, unlike Bitmain, was all-in on BCH. ...And the negatives: 1. Whether or not he was part of team Satoshi, there's definite evidence of him being dishonest and sneaky in the past wrt to provable things like backdated blogposts and quite possibly much else. Whether or not he's lying about the big question, he's clearly not entirely trustworthy. My estimate of the likelihood of him being involved in Satoshi have also gone down as his confident declarations have repeatedly failed to come true. And like Vitalik said, at this point, finding out he was Satoshi would do more to hurt my opinion of Satoshi than improve my opinion of Craig. 2. He doesn't just practice defensive patenting, he promiscuously threatens legal action and jail time against anyone who defies him; fortunately, there's... 3. He repeatedly promises big and fails to deliver or, at best, greatly underwhelms in terms of delivery. Whether intentional or just part of his manipulator DNA, this clearly functions, like the Satoshi claims, to keep people in a state of tantalized anticipation. By the time some realize his old promises have failed to come true, he's got new ones, and lurking behind it all the tantalizing idea he'll one day provide more definitive proof/backstory on the Satoshi thing. 4. Most of those who do have a lot of technical knowledge are, at best, unimpressed with any actual code he or his team produces. The above might possibly not outweigh the pros if it weren't for: His arrogant, divisive personality that created a confidence-destroying, value-destroying fork that seemed more calculated to allow him to take control than any genuine, major, fundamental difference in philosophy he could clearly explain. If it weren't for that I think he could have all the other negatives and maybe still play a valuable, if eccentric and maybe more marginal role in the community akin to someone like McAfee--not 100% above board or sane, but ultimately more an asset than a liability. He may claim it should be about his ideas, we don't have to like him, etc. and I've kind of thought to myself for a while that it's possible both to be Satoshi or part of Satoshi and an arrogant asshole, or to be both an arrogant asshole and yet also a valuable contributor, but at the end of the day he keeps emphasizing business, and like Roger says, he's just incapable of acting professional. Imagine a Jeff Bezos or Steve Jobs acting the way he does in public. They would be booted from their leadership roles even if they still had great ideas. It would be one thing, maybe if he were an asshole behind the scenes to his employees and let Jimmy do all the talking, but he doesn't: he puts himself front and center in a way that is harmful to the credibility of BCH and crypto in general. For all Craig's complaints about Bitcoin needing to grow up, Bitmain, ABC, and especially Unlimited, though not above some taunting of their own, nevertheless adopted and presented a much more careful, professional approach than Craig ever did. [Relevant tweet](URL So, imo, probably the best thing to do is just ignore him and his antics as much as possible, while also being willing to learn from him both in terms of our own (including myself here) vulnerability to such tactics, and in terms of those aspects I still think he was right to emphasize such as Bitcoin being for the world and not just a small circle of libertarians and nerds, Bitcoin needing to be business and, to some degree, maybe even regulator-friendly, needing to professionalize and offer clean, easy UI for the general public built on a stable foundation, etc."

Anyone who *receives* funds via a Lightning Network channel, must watch or have someone else watch the blockchain for attempts by the other node (on the other side of the channel) attempting to steal from them by [broadcasting an outdated commitment transaction](URL That might seem complicated. A simpler way of putting it is: if you use Lightning to receive money, then you must watch the BTC blockchain at all times to make sure that money you have received isn't stolen from you. Lightning Network node software often either *requires* Bitcoin Core or *can* use Bitcoin Core. * In the case of [eclair](URL there is an explicit requirement for Bitcoin Core 0.16.0 or higher. So exclair would in-fact only work with a version of Bitcoin Core vulnerable to the crash bug. * [LND](URL can use Bitcoin Core.

They would have to ensure that all payments made go over channels with an acceptable lifetime. 2. Wait until they receive all of those goods and services. Depending on what they're buying, this could be near instant (e.g. in the case of using a currency exchange). 3. Mine an attack block which exploits this vulnerability in Bitcoin Core software. 4. Use a specially crafted, well-connected attack node to submit the attack block to the Bitcoin Core software hooked up to the Lightning Network nodes they transacted with. This would crash their Bitcoin Core software. 5. Broadcast an outdated commitment transaction to reclaim the funds they had previously sent to businesses to pay for those goods and services. Ensure the outdated commitment transaction reaches miners to maximize the chance that it will be included in the new chain. Any businesses that fail to restart their bitcoin core software fast enough that their Lightning Network node software can spot the theft attempt, will be successfully defrauded.

Note: the small miners would likely be worse impacted due to the likelihood that they have smaller profit margins. This could have increase miner centralization. * the possibility of having to shut the entire BTC network down. * a market price crash. * long term reduced faith in the BTC chain * cascading affects on to other crypto currencies that share or forked the vulnerable Bitcoin Core code base.

Cory Fields pointed out in his write up that no matter what he thinks about bitcoin cash it is in his and the project he has an affinity for's best interest to responsibly disclose bugs to them because in the future it may turn out to be the case that someone on the other side will have information about a critical vulnerability that he would like to have responsibly disclosed as well. Fast forward to today and here we are. A critical vulnerability was found in bitcoin core and it was indeed responsibly disclosed to them and not kept hidden or sold or exploited. I don't think I can even express how important this is for both bitcoin cash and bitcoin core. I really hope this continues into the future or we are going to be headed in the direction of an inevitable disaster. Thank you so much to both cory fields and awemany for setting such a precident on both sides. I hope this continues to be the case into the future."

45,vulnerability,btc,To address concerns about my identity,165,9hyg3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9hyg3o/to_address_concerns_about_my_identity/,2018-09-22 19:29:46,"Doubts about my identity seem to crop up, so I like to address all those once more. Hopefully in a comprehensive way. First of all, to explain the situation from my article again, originstamp.org is my go-to service. Usually, 24h is *plenty* and suffices to timestamp everything. But in this case, Core went quickly ahead with release information, which made the 24h window (due to fees) too small to conclusively prove ownership *on the BTC chain*. But let's have a look in detail. This is the text that I wrote: BitcoinABC does not check for duplicate inputs when processing a block, only when inserting a transaction into the mempool. This is dangerous as blocks can be generated with duplicate transactions and then sent through e.g. compact block missing transactions and avoid hitting the mempool, creating money out of thin air. /u/awemany If you SHA256 this, it calculates to: 5c45a1ba957362a2ba97c9f8c48d4d59d4fa990945b7094a8d2a98c3a91ed9b6 Exhibit A: I timestamped that here: URL Note that there is a timestamp when it *entered* their system, which is before anything else became public and which is: 17.9.2018, 14:54:19 CEST It shows it in your local time zone in your browser, a fact that Peter Todd apparently tripped over as well: URL Scroll down to ""Submission to OriginStamp"" at the end. This timestamp is, however, just from their service and thus centralized. But if you think I faked that, that would mean that I must have hacked their service in time to do so. In the last few days. Furthermore, the window for this hack would be quite small, as there is also a later submission into the blockchain. So if you doubt this information alone, it would mean I'd had to hack the service in time (within a few hours window) just to claim this identity, leave no trace of all of this, face the risk of being called out by the true finder of the bug (who'd be different then) and write this long article ... But there's more: Exhibit B: For anyone who is a member of the BU slack, I posted a message that was the above hash (as I said in my medium article) and which is still sitting unedited on the slack as well, in the #general channel. There are likely several hundred members of this slack, and all of them who read it should have seen this message in time. I believe there are also (well-behaved) Core supporters in there. I would need to have hacked that service in an undetected way as well and fool or collude with all active members therein as well. That now creates a pretty big collusion, don't you think? Exhibit C: Finally, let me close with this PGP signed message. I created a PGP key just to keep my identity separate, at least for a while, from my main pseudonym awemany. And in the email I send out to the developers, I have added myself as a recipient. Even though the message has not been signed (I didn't see any reason to do so at the time of release), my full key id is still in this message. And that is, as far as I know, a 128-bit hash for which it is practically impossible to find a preimage for. This explicit 'encrypt-to-self' is because I fucked up with PGP encryption in the past (because, as I say in my article, mistakes just happen) and I wanted to at least be able to read my own encrypted message later. I have created sitations for myself where I wasn't able to read my own encrypted emails. Yes, call me a crypto noob, say PEBKAC or whatever, it is exactly an example of why I am saying that *I am not perfect* but so is no one else!

Alternatively, they implanted this bug deliberately in the software in the spirit of the Heartbleed vulnerability. They did it because they knew SegWit monstrosity might not be accepted by the community and as a last resort they would have forced everyone to upgrade to Segwit version as a patch to this bug.

If Bitcoin was a tradicional business, centralized, it seems reasonable that the central authority would have ""business continuity plan"" pretty high in their priorities list. Just in case, because shit happens all the time (natural disasters, hacking, sabotage...). But Bitcoin is not a centralized operation, which is great to release the pressure of many of the typical business continuity worries (such as: electricity blackout in a whole city). However, **there are still many doomsday scenarios that could happen** (*not that they are likely, but still, shit happens*). I don't recall having read about anything related to... * Identifying all possible sources of failure, evaluating their risk and likelihood. * Thinking about which procedures could be deployed in each of those cases. * Testing out those procedures, verifying that they work without breaking other things, and getting some real-life data (such as, how long it would actually take to patch-disseminate and restore the network to safety). * Better still! Making sure all important actors (devs, miners, nodes) know about those procedures, are committed to following them and have the technical know-how... Think of: hashing algorithm broken, hacker abusing a zero-day vulnerability, bug causing a chainsplit, shark eating the fibre between Asia and America and cutting off 2/3 of global hashrate (just kidding... sort of).

55,vulnerability,btc,SPV Wallet Safety Tutorial,2,93zut5,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/93zut5/spv_wallet_safety_tutorial/,2018-08-03 00:43:04,"Let me make a quick guide about SPV wallet security. I use SPV wallet and the fears about it are totally overblown fearmongering by Core, so in this guide I'd like to teach you how to use it safely and how to make absolutely sure your transaction history is accurate. If SPV is used correctly, it would be just as secure as a non-mining full node, or actually even more secure, let me explain. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; # 1) Setup The best setup in my opinion, for large sums is HARDWARE WALLET + ELECTRON CASH. Sure you can use a phone wallet or online wallet for quick transactions if they offer convenience, but for large sums and savings it is my opinion that a HW wallet is needed and Electron Cash as a gateway SPV client to the network. Any good HW wallet will not send the private keys out, so you will control your funds all the time, even if the computer or EC is compromised, the money is still safe. So you don't have to worry about direct theft. The vulnerabilities of SPV come from another angle, I will explain later. You will also need a VPN/Tor/I2P or whatever other anonymizing network to offer you protection against targeted attacks. So shop around buy the best HW wallet and a choose the best IP hiding method that you find, that is up to you to research. Also make sure anything you download is genuine, verify Electron Cash **[D56C 110F 4555 F371 AEEF CB25 4FD0 6489 EFF1 DDE1]** and whatever VPN or other software you'd use to hide your IP. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; # 2) SPV vulnerability So your private keys are always safe with a HW wallet, there is nothing the SPV system can do to steal it, but there is a possibility that it can lie to you about your coin history, which would be in the category of scam, not theft. Bitcoin Cash is a push system, not a pull one, so all we care about here is INCOMING TRANSACTIONS. Outgoing transactions don't matter from your point of view. Since if you broadcast an invalid transaction or one based on phony history, nothing will happen. The worst thing that can happen is that you upset your trading partner. But BCH by being a push system, the transaction doesn't happen until it's confirmed. It has to be confirmed by the miner majority, that is their function, so if you send out invalid transactions, then your money doesn't move. Your money doesn't move out until it's included into a block, and it can't be included in a block if it's invalid, so it won't move anywhere. It might look like the TX went out, but it will just be signalled later by your wallet that it was an invalid transaction. The vulnerability is only with INCOMING TRANSACTIONS, where if you are targeted by a scammer SPV server, it can scam you by showing that you received funds, which you didn't. **Ex:** It would be like this. You connect to SPV server X, which is operated by Bob. You also are trading with Bob but you don't know he owns the server that you get your TX history from. So Bob sends first, he sends 1 BCH to you, it appears in your wallet that you received 1 BCH, and then you send 1.82 ETH to him. However he deceived you, becaue his SPV server that you connected to only manipulated the block data to show as if you received 1 BCH whereas you didn't, and he just scammed 1.82 ETH from you. This is the only way to lose money that I can think of. However no need to worry, most SPV wallets fetch the data from not just 1 server but many and compares it, I think 8 in EC. As long as most of them are honest, you are fine. So a scammer SPV server could target you most probably in a trading situation like this, either based on your IP address (he knows from somewhere your IP and your identity) or based on your ADDRESS balance (he just randomly targets people with a lot of coins). However the latter is somewhat not that accurate since SPV servers use Bloom Filters, so they can't pinpoint exactly which wallets are yours, that is resolved locally in your wallet, so the SPV can't say for sure that ADDRESS X is yours, but with enough data it can profile you, however you probably use change addresses in EC, so it becomes really hard over time. So it's mostly your IP that stands out. That is where the VPN comes into play. So most SPV wallets have good defenses against this: randomized SPV servers, fetching multiple data, bloom filters, SPV server operators rely on reputation and donations so anyone who is a scammer would be exposed, etc.. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; # 3) Defense Plan But given all the default protections, you can still make extra steps to ensure that your TX history is absolutely correct. Here is what I would do for large transactions: &amp;nbsp; * A) Wait for 10-15 or even more confirmations (as much as you think would give you reasonable security) This is not technically a defense against evil SPV servers, but against evil Full Nodes. It's still recommended to wait for a lot of confirmations on large incoming transactions, before sending out the counterpart. &amp;nbsp; * B) Open and Close Electron Cash many times while changing IP address After you got 10-15 confirmations, do the following: Close EC -&gt; Change IP (via VPN) -&gt; Open EC -&gt; Check TX History -&gt; Repeat Essentially check for discrepancies. Do this at least 5-6 times or more, because after every time you open it, you will connect to different random SPV servers and with a different IP. So no matter whether the evil SPV server targets your IP or your address, and we assume that at least 51% of them are honest (which is a key assumption for any blockchain) then eventually the TX history that shows up most times will be the correct one. If there is no discrepancy at all between each ""draw"", then they all agree on that history to be true. But even if a certain % of SPV servers are evil, with a big enough sample size, the history that shows up the most times, will be the accurate one. So if you shuffle around your IP and SPV server enough times, eventually the honest data will overcome the dishonest data. If in the example above, you'd do that, then it's impossible for Bob to controll all SPV servers to deceive you. And if you find contradictory history, that would raise your suspicion so you'd become suspicious of Bob. So just do this step many times and the history that comes up most often will be the true one, and if there is no discrepancy, then you are not under attack, if there is, then just repeat it many more times until the true history will appear more times than the untrue ones. &amp;nbsp; * C) Additionally check it on a Block Explorer In the very unlikely scenario that ALL SPV servers are compromised, you can still heck your TX history on well trusted block explorers such as: * URL * URL * URL * URL * URL These are all very reputable explorers so they are not in the business of lying otherwise their reputation would be destroyed. Check your transactions on these block explorers too for ultimate certainty. If all SPV servers agree on a large random sample with randomized IP address being used, and if all blockexplorers agree too, then it's extremely unlikely that your TX is bogus. It would take a massive scale attack to compromise all of them at once. And even then if you just wait more and verify it from additional sources, then you can be 99.99999% certain that it's genuine. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; -------------- &amp;nbsp; So as you can see the fear of the Core trolls is totally overblown. If you do this method correctly and diligently, you are just as safe with an SPV than you are with a Full Node. In fact you are even more safe, because a Full Node is hard to be run through a VPN because it consumes a lot of bandwidth, and it might leave data there that would deanonymize you, making you vulnerable to attackers, so if you want to be 100% sure, you'd do the verificaion in a more dynamic way suggested above. Even even now many nodes can be under DDOS attack, so for amateurs it would be hard to filter out what IP addresses to block and what not to. So leave that to experts, and all you already get good quality data from the nodes, all you need to do is just verify your SPV server by random sampling their data to see if they are consistent. If you detect an SPV server that tries to lie to you, then you can just expose them, and since they all rely on donations and usually have a reputation behind them, that would be ruined. I was always using SPV wallets and quite frankly never detected any kind of deceit. So the probability of even this is ultra low, but still good to verify it. The only thing that I have experienced is that a few SPV servers are usually lagging behind due to poor connections or obsolete software, but I have never got any fake transaction. Eventually SPV software developers could add additional nodes to compare to, but with the default setup you are already reasonably secure in normal transactions. As for high transactions, just do the steps shows above. "

57,vulnerability,btc,"The Lightning Network on top of Bitcoin is like a strangler fig tree. ""The Lightning system itself becomes the token, leaving Bitcoin, Litecoin and all Blockchains as dead and hollow ghosts of their former state.""",52,8slv0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8slv0n/the_lightning_network_on_top_of_bitcoin_is_like_a/,2018-06-21 06:49:54,"&gt; The last start of a system such as Lightning is the creation of a system that mirrors a Strangler fig. This is portrayed in the image below. The Lightning system itself becomes the token, leaving Bitcoin, Litecoin and all Blockchains as dead and hollow ghosts of their former state. The myth is that we need to have an underlying system such as Bitcoin. I say myth here as the truth is we live in a world where legal tender is no longer backed by sound monetary policy and is designed to support the goals of the state. &gt; In time, if Lightning was to become a trusted medium of exchange, it leads to the perverse scenario where it no longer requires a commodity base to make it work. This leads to a system of State currency that eats cryptocurrency (such as Bitcoin) away leaving only the promise of what it was. Some will get rich from this, but the system will not be Bitcoin, it will be a form of government exchanges and banks that swap account balances. &gt; You can be told how this will never occur, but there is no other end. Exchanges and Lightning hubs are already systems that come within the control of the legal system. Once the controls and requirements to alter balances are incorporated (and this path leads to a Proof of State system with a Ripple-like consensus), the system is just the shell of what created it. &gt; Lightning becomes the system that enslaves, not the system that frees the world. &gt; It has been (deceptively) argued that for Bitcoin to use Payment channels, a malleability fix is required. This was and never shall be the case. Payment channels have been a feature of Bitcoin since the initial release. It was later that many of the features that helped make this simpler have been disabled and removed. &gt; The truth is one of bitcoin being stronger as an alloy. SegWit (Segregated Witness) was incorporated into bitcoin to remove a (disingenuously) created vulnerability that never existed. The argued reason was to allow Bitcoin to utilise payment channels [11]. The truth is payment channels do not require non-malleable transactions. The only requirement for removing Malleability is to allow Lightning to act as a promissory note over Bitcoin and other blockchains. That is, to allow it to consume Bitcoin and to remove the economic system that created bitcoin. &gt; The Lighting System differs from anything that Bitcoin used. It is a system of punishment-based bi-directional payment channels. It uses negative inducements rather than positive economic incentives as would be the case in Bitcoin natively. Punishment based channels of the form implemented in Lightning require a malleability fix. Payment channels and even atomic swaps can be completed without a malleability fix. A non-issue. &gt; A high-frequency system such as we see discussed above never required malleability to be removed. Malleability is of no concern to this system. &gt; The thing that matters far more than any of the technical uses of Malleability[3] is what malleability breaks. It makes the creation of a parasitic overlay more difficult and economically less viable. Bitcoin is a system that is resilient in many ways. The central aspect of this is that in its true form, it can capture other systems while remaining challenging to capture itself. More than anything else, SegWit and related fixes remove this resilience. &gt; Without some level of transaction Malleability, the system can easily fragment into many coins, and these can then be captured (and consumed) by a system that is a digital equivalent of the existing fiat system. If you want to create a system that replaces fiat with a system controlled by the banks and government but which is more insidious then you should be supporting SegWit and Lightning. &gt; A miner of Bitcoin Core (BTC) should be concerned. BTC Hodlers should be concerned. Lightning required that malleability be removed as this allows the system to move to long-term channels that with cross chain swaps can eventually remove the underlying commodity cryptocurrency. As noted above, this in all forms is a security and is in the range of systems that require registering and management under the various AML/CTF laws. &gt; In any system where there are asymmetries, one side has an advantage. In Bitcoin, the network was incentivised asymmetrically to allow for the growth of a small world and eventually a near complete graph. In Lighting, this forms a loose mesh with a small number of centrally controlled choke points. The economics of each system are designed with distinctly separate goals in mind. &gt; Removing transaction malleability does not make Bitcoin more secure, it allows for a system of off chain swaps. It makes the creation and integration of side-chains simpler and removes one of the critical aspects of Bitcoin, scarcity. When Lightning (or another system in a similar form) can set the terms of the settlement and, in time even alter settlement to remove the requirement to hold the currency, we end where we are now. A system that has and will be debased. &gt; At least Bitcoin Cash (BCH) managed to avoid this trap. [Source](URL"

I am writing this message because there was a theft of my funds from my ""Polonix"" exchange account in the amount equivalent to 6000 USD. 16.06.18 when I tried to log in with my ""Polonix"" account, I found that two factor authentication (2FA) was enabled. I did not make this inclusion, because of this I lost access to my account. I created a ticket for this problem, ""Polonix"" answered technical support only on the third day. The essence of their answer was that I need to provide a photo to confirm my identity. After uploading the photo, the two-factor authentication was disabled, I got access to my account and found out that all my funds were transferred to unknown wallets. It all happened, an unknown person on 16.06.18 logged in to my account from the IP address 64.64.121.70 and transferred funds with three transfers, while messages about logging into my account on my email DID NOT COME. Also, there were no messages on my e-mail to confirm the transfer of funds. Very important is the fact that for 18 days (I have been a client of the Polonix exchange for more than a year) before this event, the Polonix exchange blocked my account and the requirement for unlocking was to complete full authentication of the person, after which it became possible to transfer more than the equivalent of 2000 USD per day. About what I have a saved correspondence. During these events, I met several people. They also stole money on the Polonix exchange. These four people, one of them has dual citizenship, one of which is US citizenship. Curiously, three of them had 2FA enabled, but this did not help save their money, they also lost access to their account, and their 2FA code did not fit. We came to an unambiguous conclusion during the discussion. Theft of funds occurs with the help of employees of the Polonix Exchange, or them. This is happy with direct and censual evidence. 1. With 2FA disabled, you can not log into your account from a new IP address without getting one-time authentication code. 2)My email ([pfedotovtns@gmal.com](mailto:pfedotovtns@gmal.com)) is protected by 2FA. Physical access to devices registered in google has only me. In the list of devices that have access to my google account in the last 28 days, there are no other except those that I used. 3)You must confirm by e-mail to transfer funds. 4)At the time of the theft, Polonix blocks the account. For those who have 2FA disabled, it turned on, and those who have 2FA enabled the code does not fit. 5)In my case, to access your account, I used a complicated eight-digit password that digested the numbers and Latin characters of the large and small register. It was not recorded anywhere, only I knew it and was used only for the Polonix account. We believe the Polonix exchange is guilty of stealing its customer's funds or reporting critical vulnerability to a group of hackers. We consider it advisable to declare collectively in The United States Securities and Exchange Commission and FBI on behalf of a US citizen."
59,vulnerability,btc,AsicBoost and the strange case of CVE-2017-9230,99,8lutv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8lutv4/asicboost_and_the_strange_case_of_cve20179230/,2018-05-25 04:13:44,"# About CVEs In the public interest of tracking and remedying cybersecurity vulnerabilities quickly, a public database was created in 2000: the CVE List [1]. CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. Its database records, known as CVEs, track and record publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each recorded vulnerability has a unique ID and lifecycle where it follows certain states. # The AsicBoost controversy In April 2017, Greg Maxwell published an email [2] on the bitcoin-dev mailing list which described AsicBoost - a patented optimization to the algorithm used in Bitcoin mining - as an attack on the Bitcoin protocol. There was much contention [3] about whether AsicBoost constituted some kind of harmful exploit, or whether it was merely a technological innovation which enabled more efficient mining hardware (ASICs). There were allegations, widely reported in media, that the patent served the interest of Bitmain [4]. The purported benefits of exploiting this patent were contemporaneously disputed by other miners [5]. # CVE-2017-9230 raised against AsicBoost On May 18, Cameron Garnham posted to the bitcoin-dev list [6], urging for getting a CVE assigned to the perceived vulnerability. On May 24, this CVE was created as CVE-2017-9230 [7]. It was simultaneously published under Bugtraq ID 'BID 98657' at [8]. The justification in the CVE stated that the AsicBoost method &gt; 'violates the security assumptions of (1) the choice of input, outside &gt; of the dedicated nonce area, fed into the Proof-of-Work function should &gt; not change its difficulty to evaluate and (2) every Proof-of-Work &gt; function execution should be independent.' It seemed a plausible enough reasoning for the CVE to be assigned. It was entered in the list of Bitcoin-related CVE's at [9]. Detailed information on this particular CVE is still missing/incomplete on the wiki page, a year after the CVE was raised. # What happened since the CVE was raised If you've followed along, you've learned that the CVE was raised to counter the exploitation of the AsicBoost method by miners. Since then, however, a Core developer, BtcDrak, has been involved in the founding of a mining company, Halong Mining. Several online sources state his (part?) ownership of this company. BtcDrak has put forward a proposal [10] which would enable the use of AsicBoost within the Bitcoin Core software (the dominant client software on the BTC network). This proposal appears to directly contradict the CVE claims of how AsicBoost violates ""security assumptions"" of Bitcoin, and indeed does not address how it mitigates them, nor is CVE-2017-9230 referenced in any of its related documentation. While the proposal's specification [11] and implementation [12] have not yet been formally accepted, the situation is that Halong has shipped mining equipment which is now actively employing AsicBoost [13,14] on the Bitcoin (BTC) network. There is even a website showing the blocks where AsicBoost was used [15]. # Conflict of interest There a clear conflict of interest in the actions of the Core developer BtcDrak. His actions as a Core developer appear to be furthering his company's interests and competitive advantage in the mining industry by exploiting a vulnerability of which he must have been keenly aware, having participated on the same bitcoin-dev mailing list where it was discussed. The CVE was vociferously used to paint Bitmain as culpable for delaying Segwit (Bitmain was accused of using AsicBoost and blocking Segwit activation for their own profit motive - claims that Bitmain has publicly denied strongly and which were never substantiated). One might have expected a similar outcry against Halong's *proven* and *announced* use of AsicBoost, but the parties that had previously condemned Bitmain remained mostly silent. Only an anonymous non-developer, Cobra-Bitcoin, co-owner of the bitcoin.org domain, spoke out on the Github pull request in [11], and Core developer Luke-jr spoke out against the use of the proposal on the Bitcoin network while consensus had not been reached on it [16]. Subsequent discussion on the bitcoin-dev list on this topic since March has been minimal and only concerned with technicalities of stratum protocol changes. # The bigger elephant in the room It seems logical that either AsicBoost constitutes an exploitable weakness, and thus merits a CVE and measures taken to prevent its use on the Bitcoin network entirely. Or it is not a problem and the CVE should be invalidated. The Bitcoin Core project should use its consensus processes to arrive at a coherent decision. # Other problems raised by the use of overt AsicBoost The Halong implementation uses version rolling of the `nversion` bits of the header. It reserves a subset of those bits for overt AsicBoost. These bits are no longer available to BIP9, but there was no update of BIP9 proposed to address this impact. This is a question of sensible procedures being followed (or not). The author did not find any review comment mentioning the lack of BIP9 specification update, which suggest a lack of thorough review on a proposal which dates back several months. A minor issue is that the Core implementation warns when a certain proportion of unrecognized version bits are detected. This behavior can be triggered by the AsicBoost method used on the network. --- [1] URL [2] URL [3] URL [4] URL [5] URL [6] URL [7] URL [8] URL [9] URL [10] URL [11] URL [12] URL [13] URL [14] URL [15] URL [16] URL"

The CVE list will be notified accordingly. Our view is that what has been described in CVE-2017-9230 as an ""attack methodology"" is a benign mining optimization. Since the CVE was raised, a Bitcoin Core developer has overtly implemented a change request to the software and caused this optimization to be available and actively used in Bitcoin (BTC) mining. This is documented in the summary below which concludes that either the CVE is a real problem and should be fixed, or the overt support of the method now should be considered grounds to invalidate the CVE. URL Bitcoin mining pools such as Slush Pool have since embraced ASICBOOST (the common name describing the method, based on the well known patent of that name) as a legitimate optimization on Bitcoin.

This attack onion wraps payloads via hop by hop where the last hop is the first hop creating a self-denial of service where the LN nodes attack themselves after long route traversal. Exploiting the anonymous nature of onion routing allows no defense to the network. Anonymous routing in and of itself creates a situation where the network can get into an endless loop of self DDoS. Once we complete the entire message serialization routines and a deadline timer the TESTBED will run standalone continuously. Prob. only take another day to complete that.

Because onion routing requires decryption (CPU Intensive) this can also be used to clog pathways with old payloads via CPU exhaustion.

The slowest code pathways make the best AVs. bitPico [9:52 PM] CircuitKeys are allocated on the heap. (edited) Underlying implementation would use malloc/realloc/free. Instead of RAII. This is asking for an overflow into unknown memory segments. We suggest stack only allocation. Memory on the stack is trivial to maintain; it has no holes; it can be mapped straight into the cache; it is attached on a per-thread basis. Memory in the heap is a heap of objects; it is more difficult to maintain; it can have holes. Laolu Osuntokun [9:59 PM] @bitPico cpu usage is super minimal, this isn't tor so we're not relaying like gigabytes unknown memory segments? golang is a memory safe language stuff goes on the stack, then escape analysis is used to decide what should go on the heap bitPico [10:00 PM] Heap allocation is more of a concern here. golang is not memory safe; it uses C underneath. Laolu Osuntokun [10:01 PM] uhh bitPico [10:01 PM] golang is not written in golang :slightly_smiling_face: Laolu Osuntokun [10:01 PM] yes it is... URL GitHub golang/go go - The Go programming language bitPico [10:02 PM] Thats like saying the C runtime is C and not ASM. The C runtime is ASM. Laolu Osuntokun [10:02 PM] go is written in go before go 1.4 (maybe 1.5) is was written in c but still, your ""attack vector"" isn't an implementation level issue, it's a network/kernel level DoS recycling, syn cookies, etc, would be needed not impl level defenses (edited) bitPico [10:07 PM] We know the answer but what does golang compile to? Laolu Osuntokun [10:07 PM] also replay htlc's will be rejected native? bitPico [10:08 PM] ASM Laolu Osuntokun [10:08 PM] yeh... bitPico [10:08 PM] So what we said is exactly true. Laolu Osuntokun [10:08 PM] no? bitPico [10:08 PM] Its as vulnerable as we stated. Laolu Osuntokun [10:08 PM] &gt; the heap is a heap of objects; it is more difficult to maintain; it can have holes bitPico [10:09 PM] It still allocates through OS heap memory and not onto the stack in your case here. Which means it has holes. Laolu Osuntokun [10:10 PM] aight, lemmie know when you exploit these issues in the golang runtime here's the code if you wanna study it: URL GitHub golang/go go - The Go programming language bitPico [10:11 PM] ASM is ASM. Heap is heap. Heap is bad in this case. Stack is wise. Same applies to C or C++. Avoid the heap at all costs. Laolu Osuntokun [10:12 PM] aye aye, capt stark [10:12 PM] replied to a thread: Seeing bad OP-SEC on LN; dont name your node as the type of hardware. Those raspberry pis will go down. don't name your node at all.... bitPico [10:12 PM] URL Laolu Osuntokun [10:13 PM] cool, i'll be waiting on those exploits in the go runtime, i'm sure many others will be excited as well bitPico [10:14 PM] Has nothing to do with go. It uses malloc underneath. Heap always uses malloc; go, c or c++ or java or whatever. Laolu Osuntokun [10:15 PM] sure, i think many of us know how memory management works bitPico [10:15 PM] URL Security experts avoid heap allocation. This is common knowledge. Noticed somebody commented about performance of the PR. That is because of the use of heap allocation instead of stack. Laolu Osuntokun [10:17 PM] no, it's because of the disk I/O bitPico [10:18 PM] So LN nodes write data to disk in case of crash? As to not lose funds? Thats what the PR says. Anyway golang uses libc; it is not compiled into pure ASM. (edited) Nevertheless we are not focusing on golang; LN in general and TCP/IP stacks. d [10:22 PM] @bitPico write an exploit and get back with us. Until then it just sounds like concern trolling. bitPico [10:24 PM] Funny, we are exhausting LN TCP/IP Stacks as we type this Its no good if we can overtake the TCP stack and run it out of FDs. We have 100's of connections to LN nodes and it;s automated using our hand built attack toolkit. When we increase this to 1000's then what? Matt Drollette [10:26 PM] Isnt that true of any TCP service though? Or are you saying there is something Lightning or `lnd` specific about your method? Laolu Osuntokun [10:26 PM] it's true of any TCP service the defenses are on the kernel level bitPico [10:27 PM] Youd need to have LN code handle millions of connections to mitigate this. We know golang will crash if this happens. But so will C. Matt Drollette [10:29 PM] Im beginning to wonder if @bitPico is actually performing a meta-attack on Lightning. A denial-of-service at the developer level with all this subtle trolling bitPico [10:29 PM] This first problem is LN keeps inbound connections alive. It does not handle and drop them like a webserver. This is the only reason webservers can scale. Apache uses a timeout of 3 seconds in most cases. Currently we are connected to 45 LN nodes with over 22K connections. One variable change on our end and the network will suffer. (edited) Matt Drollette [10:31 PM] but is that variable on the heap? bitPico [10:32 PM] On Linux consider forcing it to require 999999 FDs. AND do not keep-alive connections. The variable is an enum (an integer). Attack aggressiveness Matt Drollette [10:33 PM] Im just joking with you :stuck_out_tongue: I look forward to the write-up on the attack bitPico [10:33 PM] Otherwise our code will keep LN nodes hung in TIME_WAIT. Anyway we are not trolling; we are BTC whales and LN must not fail. Otherwise our investment suffers. The only motivation behind this testing As it stands LN nodes need L7 LB. Code will run overnight; sleep before we continue. Good job though on LN so far. bitPico [10:46 PM] uploaded and commented on this image: Screen Shot 2018-03-19 at 1.44.19 AM.png Fun stats: Weve sucked 3.3 GBs of bandwidth per hour from LN nodes. This will continue while we sleep. Every 80 milliseconds there is 44 attacks being performed. bitPico [10:48 PM] :sleeping: kekalot [1:35 AM] Seems likely. They were also the one who claimed segwit 2x would continue after it was officially canceled. Matt Drollette Im beginning to wonder if @bitPico is actually performing a meta-attack on Lightning.

63,vulnerability,btc,ELI5: Why the one who actually doesn't understand bitcoin memorylessness is Peter Rizun and any proponent of the Selfish mining strategy.,45,88acc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/88acc6/eli5_why_the_one_who_actually_doesnt_understand/,2018-03-31 00:31:13,"Back in July Peter wrote a forum post [""Wright or wrong""](URL criticising CSW's paper where CSW refutes Emin's SM vulnerability. Selfish Mining ELI5: if you are a miner and you do not publish a block you found then you can get a head start on the next block. When you find the next block you can then publish both blocks at a smaller cost of what it would have costed you by mining honestly. Specifically, CSW states: &gt;""In the selfish mining strategy (Eyal and Sirer 2013) it is claimed that ""events occur at exponential intervals with an average frequency of a and (1-a) respectively"" where a represents the selfish miner's proportion of the total processing power. In this paper, we demonstrate how this assertion is unsound"" Peter says he disagrees with this, and that CSW is wrong because if selfish miners have *a* portion of the total hash power then they find blocks at a rate proportional to that. In other words, if selfish miners control 30% of the hash power then they find 30% of blocks and so on. CSW said that such claim was unsound and Peter said CSW was wrong. Peter doesn't post any screenshot of how CSW defends his point in his Wright or Wrong post. This distorts the entire argument making it look like CSW doesn't know that the chances of finding a block are proportional to the hashpower a mining pool controls. The key to understanding CSW's point is the key phrase ""selfish mining strategy"". What Peter seems to not grasp is that when CSW says selfish miners find blocks at a lower rate than *a* it is because a lot of the blocks selfish miners find &amp; hide are actually lost. In fact, a selfish miner can only publish a hidden block if he also found the block right after it. But since the system is memoryless then the chances of a selfish miner of finding 2 blocks in a row remains 1/9 or around 11% regardless of whether he published the first block or not. Almost 9 times out of 10 the hidden block is lost. So at the end of the day, the number of blocks a selfish miner finds is even less than his fair share of blocks. This point is important, because the entire argument is based on the fact that bitcoin hashing is memoryless. CSW basically says that even if you start hashing on the next block 20 seconds ahead of me you still have the same *a* chance of finding the next block which is proportional to your fraction of the total hashpower. So the entire CSW argument boils down to saying that there is no such thing as *head start* in bitcoin mining **because the system is memoryless** so if you hide blocks you are only making less money. How could Peter say that CSW does not know that Bitcoin mining is memoryless if his entire refutation of the Selfish Mining strategy is based on this property? If Peter doesn't agree then he is either trying to mislead the rest of us or he really thinks that getting a head start actually matters and that Bitcoin mining **is not** memoryless.

I still own some, just on a FOMO [fear of missing out] basis, but that's my 10% hopeful gamble. Notice the word I just used : gamble. Psychological intervention on my own reverb. I'm 90% out. Has anyones thoughts changed on how the market (general population/psychology) treats crypto? The market is broke. Okex is now manipulating prices (drove Bitcoin down to $4000 on futures contract when other exchanges were around $8000 - just so it could fuck with legit 'stock like' Chicago Mercantile Exchange Bitcoin Futures). Bitfinex is trying to relocate [read my posts in December about Bitfinex]. The Bitcoin system was built because the banking system couldn't be trusted, specifically. (2008) The ""owners"" of Bitcoin are the exchanges. Decentralization or ""no regluations"" has fucked Bitcoin. So, long term, no. I found an old FUD [fear uncertainty doubt] post I made on 12-28, I saw the market collapsing so I began cashing out. The H0DLer's gambit and psychology was a human vulnerability, that one could profit on. Mr. Robot style. This human vulnerability I've seen in stocks like $AMD. A cult like following. There is reward, and then theres also risk. Cash out, as I've made the case and warnings multiple times before here, and elsewhere. No, Ripple is not going to $5.00 heres why. Every, single, crypto, currency, currently trading is absolutely tainted by fraud and the 'index' there in that it relies itself upon Bitcoin. You cannot fund Ripple, without Bitcoin. Exchanges pumped/printed worthless Bitcoin in the excess of billions on UPWARD momentum only. Imagine, one person, spending $2B in December on Bitcoin - all at once. That's basically what happened. Except it wasn't a person, it was the worlds largest exchange by volume -- Bitfinex [volume which was manipulated, also - ever since being served a supoena by SEC in January, Bitfinex has stopped 'pumping' and the price is now 70% off from all time highs]. Now these exchanges are trying to avoid basically, what amounts to warrants, by relocating from China to Switzerland. That's not alarming. Also - ASIC miners being made for Eth now. This war of running networks, mining the shit out of them with maximum computattional power is going to screw with Eth prices, as other miners gets out and it becomes 'centralized' mining like with Bitcoin. The power generation, and so on.. regulations will come in that form. Its getting crazy. Thoughts on that? Sorry but I see Bitcoin going to $4000 in the short-term. Long term, read above, and also abide by historical rules and know what bubbles are. In January, everyone said HOLD. It's ""seasonal"" - ""EVERY January this happens"". You've had how many years of historical indices to predict a massive market shift and predictability of voltaility, before unrelied upon by a microscope of regulations? Ok. Like I stated before, the market is illiquid and will forever be, because certain exchanges manipulated the market and literally, forever have changed the price and future history of the value. I have posted about this a ton. Can that system ever be trusted again? Do you see the huge price swings going on? There are many more regulations to come. If not an outright ban. Does anything surprise us anymore? Seriously. I think that ""oh shit, were living in an Orwellian state now"" --thanks Facebook is quite awakening. What surprises us anymore? It further increases FUD, because anything is possible. Read 1984. Were there, except the novel should have been called 2018. Cheers."

66,vulnerability,btc,Core VS Cash,0,8berbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8berbi/core_vs_cash/,2018-04-11 15:37:37,"I have been doing research on both sides of the block debate. The following are some of the highlights I have gathered from core supporters. Proponents of lightning network and core believe that block stream will increase core's block-size eventually. They are just waiting for the right time so as not to end up like BCH with only 10% hashrate. Furthermore, they believe the block limit is necessary to prevent spam. Core supporters believe that the network was spammed by BCH supporters at a time when core was gaining traction, hence it became expensive if you wanted speed. This limit was set by Satoshi just for cases like that: To avoid people spamming the network for dirt-cheap. Core is solving scaling through off-chain transactions, and optimizing on-chain transactions (Segwit). Core supporters also believe that BCH hasn't solved scaling, all it has done is make it more centralized and allowed itself to handle more spam before the bottleneck is reached. Ask yourself, how much $ does it take to fill up the BCH mempool? Core supporters state that BCH isn't seeing the effects because barely anyone is using it. Lastly, they believe that the idea of blockchain storing coffee-like transactions permanently is foolish. Eventually it will take months or years to download the full chain. However, Bcore is centralized because it's github is utterly controlled by a corporation that intends to turn it into a banking layer. Off chain transaction data opens a vulnerability by placing trust in a centralized point of whoever handles that data off chain. Blockstream will never increase the blocksize because they can't profit from their sidechain bullshit or from operating payment nodes if fees are low, people will just use on chain transactions. Core's solution of moving part of the transaction off chain isn't a solution either, it's a step backwards so that banks can profit from off-chain solutions (ex: watchtowers, fees, etc.). So the question remains: How do you solve the scalability issue on chain without increasing the block size? Why can't BTC or BCH cucks answer straight questions? You guys always just measure dick size till the thread dies and no one can figure out the truth. If neither are good solutions, then what IS a good solution?"

69,vulnerability,btc,"I've done some tests, this is how reddit accounts might be getting compromised. Some coder might be able to help",150,7ncz73,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ncz73/ive_done_some_tests_this_is_how_reddit_accounts/,2018-01-01 14:30:17,"So I have been trying different things to compromise my own accounts and these are my conclusions: 1) It is impossible from the reddit username to come up to the email of the user because reddit doesn't give out any hints when resetting the password. 2) I searched the posts of compromised users such as /u/jessquit and couldn't find anything where he mentions his email. 3) I also checked shop links /u/jessquit posted and none of those shops give out any hints about the email when you try to reset the password. 4) Several victims have reported that the password was resetted without the email from reddit being opened. Conclusion 1: If your reddit got hacked your email/identity was not compromised. The attacker did not hack you through the email. SO I started to play around with reset links and it appears that this is strictly a reddit issue because reddit sends expiration free reset links, not sure how to call them because they never expire. In other words, if someone can decode how reset links for accounts are generated (they must have an algorithm or something) then they can simply click on reset password for any username, generate the reset link, paste it on their browser, change your password (user receives email that password has been changed) and sign in with new password. All this because reddit does not read where the resetter is coming from (whether from the read email reddit sends the user or direct traffic). For example, I set up a test account and requested a password reset. I received an email with this reset link: URL If you click on the link [you must be signed out] you will be able to reset the password of the account. Even though you are probably on the other side of the world. I tried to look into a couple of reset links but I do not see any pattern. I believe hackers have the key of whatever coding algorithm reddit is using to generate these links and exploit the fact that links do not expire and are not sensible to whether the user clicks on the reset email or not to hack accounts. Hope this helps to solve this asap. **Edit 1**: After looking into the reddit code in github it appears that predicting the reset link is impossible because it is generated randomly and nobody predict a random value. The only vulnerability with reddit reset links then appears to be that they do not expire (expire in 12h) and work even if the user's emailed link is not opened/clicked. They can be streamed and still work. As result the only explanation at this point is that someone with access to Reddit's outbox database (probably a reddit employee) is exploiting these reset links independently to change passwords and hack accounts. This person is the hacker or is working for the hacker (s). **Edit 2**: List of recent hacks that could have used this *exploit*: [1] (URL [2] (URL [3](URL [4] (URL (URL [6](URL [7](URL"

77,vulnerability,btc,Bitcoin ABC users who didn't upgrade before Nov 13: upgrade to 0.16.1,63,7d93am,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7d93am/bitcoin_abc_users_who_didnt_upgrade_before_nov_13/,2017-11-16 12:51:43,"This is just a heads up for ABC node operators who have not upgraded to the 0.16.x version. If you haven't noticed by now, you will not be on the upgraded chain. Also, some miner has decided to mine an alternate, non-upgraded chain that follows the old EDA. We don't know exactly who, but there's [a tweet from Alistair Milne](URL (which is incorrect on the vulnerability aspect btw) that associates this with 'Bitcoin Clashic' - a mocking fork whose purpose in life seems to be to act as fodder for social media trolling campaigns against Bitcoin Cash. Why does this matter? Because if you don't upgrade, your node would be at risk of eventually following their chain, once it accumulates enough work to supercede your chain which is currently stuck at the pre-fork block. As the 'Clashic' (or whatever they want to call themselves) chain has not yet reached the same amount of work as the current Bitcoin Cash chain, your node would not have followed the Clashic chain yet. Please upgrade swiftly, otherwise you will later need to do more steps to rid your datadir of Clashic blocks. Your coins are safe nevertheless, but since Clashic did not implement its own replay protection to distinguish it from the Bitcoin Cash network, transactions made on non-upgraded nodes could end up being replayed to the active Cash chain (this is probably not bad if you were thinking that you are transacting on Cash chain anyway). Update download link: URL --- P.S. Anyone can choose an old block in the blockchain to start a fork. This is not really a threat as long as they have minority of hashpower compared to the main Cash chain, because what matters for selection of the active chain is the amount of accumulated work - not the height of the chain. Exchanges should just demand that a fork with minority hashpower implement a replay protection to make it impossible to replay onto the majority chain. This is what they have been demanding up to now."
78,vulnerability,btc,"How BTC is vulnerable to attack, and why that vulnerability is not being fixed",13,7f8bzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7f8bzv/how_btc_is_vulnerable_to_attack_and_why_that/,2017-11-25 03:00:33,"Bitcoin can be attacked by exploiting flaws in the Bitcoin protocol in order to make Bitcoin transactions extremely expensive, both in money and time. How does this attack work? **First, a brief technical background:** The Bitcoin mining network depends on a computational handicap called difficulty, used to make sure that new Bitcoin is produced at a specific target interval, roughly every 10 minutes. Because miners can join and leave the network at will, the total compute power of the network fluctuates. To ensure that these fluctuations don't result in producing Bitcoin at a rate too far from once every 10 minutes, the difficulty must be adjusted: higher when there is more compute power available, and lower when there is less. Difficulty is automatically adjusted roughly every 336 hours. The attack itself: **The first part of this attack** involves a bunch of miners conspiring to join the Bitcoin network, thus raising its compute power. Then, immediately after the difficulty is adjusted, the miners leave the network. This results in the difficulty being set too high, meaning that the actual rate at which new Bitcoin is produced will be longer than the target of 10 minutes. **The reason this matters so much** is that the rate at which new Bitcoin is produced is intrinsically tied to the rate at which transactions are processed. They are both tied to the difficulty. If the difficulty is too high, transactions take a long time to process. **The second part of this attack**, which works in conjunction with the first, is to place a high demand on the transaction processing capacity of the Bitcoin network. What a group of attackers could do is to automate the sending of many small transactions. Because, as you'll recall from part 1, the rate at which transactions are processed is slow due to the difficulty mis-match, and because there is such an abundance of transactions to be processed, a huge backlog is created. Miners process transactions with higher fees first, so if a sender wants to have their transaction complete in the minimum time available, they can choose to pay a higher transaction fee. **The third part of this attack** is creating incentives via market manipulation. Put simply, this means wealthy holders dumping BTC and pumping other crypto coins. These effects can snowball if smaller holders then sell their BTC and buy other coins in hopes of avoiding loss or gaining profits. As the price of BTC falls, it becomes less profitable to mine, and others' rising price make them more profitable to mine. This creates an incentive for miners to choose the other coin's network, thereby leaving the BTC network exactly when they are needed most. Furthermore, as owners of BTC see the price drop, they might send their BTC to an exchange to sell it in hopes of avoiding loss. This will lead to a larger backlog of transactions. **What this all adds up to** is a vicious cycle: dropping BTC prices -&gt; less profitable to mine BTC -&gt; slower/more expensive BTC transactions -&gt; BTC less useful as a currency -&gt; less BTC users -&gt; dropping BTC prices **What this attack reveals** is just why the ""Bitcoin is a store of value"" narrative has become so important: because Bitcoin is extremely vulnerable to the attack I've described, making it unusable as a currency. Marketing it as a ""store of value"" downplays this vulnerability, which is in truth, severe. **Why not simply fix the vulnerability?** The fix to this vulnerability has existed since Bitcoin's creation and is outlined in the Bitcoin whitepaper. The ""problem"" is that it would result in more transactions being mined per unit of time, and thus a higher amount of transaction fees being paid to miners. The reason this is a ""problem"" is that the mining system is designed with some resemblance to a lottery, with compute power being analogous to tickets. The difficulty aspect of the mining system is designed to protect against anti-competitive practices: when a new miner joins the network, the difficulty adjustment ensures that the new miner's lottery tickets are equally as valuable as those of current miners. The new miner may have more tickets, or less, but the point is that there is no way to create different classes of tickets, such that their owners can be given preferential treatment. The only way to gain an advantage is to acquire more compute power, and this protects against anti-competitiveness because if someone is controlling an unfair proportion of the lottery tickets, you can always buy more, and be assured that they will be equally as valid as the competition's. This is not a scenario that is favorable to maximizing profitability. Some interests would prefer that they could buy special tickets which their competition didn't have access too. **Therefore, rather than fixing the vulnerability**, it has been labeled an essential ""feature"", and the controlling interests of Bitcoin have chosen to move the bulk of transactions to a separate ""layer"", so that the miners are responsible only for creating the final record of large transactions, rather than many smaller individual transactions. This new layer is effectively a way of rigging the lottery. However, this is not because there will be special tickets that let someone win disproportionately. It's because the bulk of transaction fees will simply never be included in the prize pool of the lottery."

Have any realistic calculations been done (eg. 7 years times * 1Mb block * 8)? * Is anything being done to reduce the miner centralization which seems to have proven itself a vulnerability/potential risk to the ""freedom"" of how the coin is run? * How many miners are currently mining BCH and is there any consideration about what to do if they decide stage a similar coup to the S2X situation? Other questions: * Regarding the development team working on BCH, are they well-known and have they been involved in the Bitcoin project for some time? * Given that any failure of Bitcoin will be see a drop in everyone's investment (regardless of Bitcoin flavour), what good can you see coming out of potentially sidelining the Core development team through the introduction of S2X? * If Bitcoin Core *is* sidelined, which development team do you see picking up the on-going work, especially when it seems the main developer of S2X is promoting alternate coins and the btc1 github seems to be not very active? * Do people here care about the success of S2X or do they consider it a win-win since uncertainly is likely to cause investment capital to flow to BCH? I know these are very highly charged questions and before you choose to respond, please take a moment to understand the context of my questions: I am trying to understand where the future may go in relation Bitcoin. I am after **factual** information that (ideally) can be backed with further reading. If an answer requires some speculation, then some well-reasoned arguments go a long way. While I'm sure some of you will be tempted to get offensive and defensive (many of the respondents in my r/Bitcoin post did), I will ignore the feedback unless it raises some thought-provoking points. Hopefully this post can become informative to those people watching this fray on the sidelines with a fist-full of dollars ready to invest. Please don't forget that if you support a project, abrasive comments do nothing for your cause. With that in mind, thank you for your input and I promise to post a summary of my understanding from all the feedback I get. If I manage to get enough of an insight, I could also post a summary in a ""neutral"" sub-reddit to give some of my personal thoughts (assuming there is interest). "

86,vulnerability,btc,Why do people prefer the upgraded Bitcoin Cash over Bitcoin Segwit? Here's the reasons.,16,7byhko,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7byhko/why_do_people_prefer_the_upgraded_bitcoin_cash/,2017-11-10 14:10:59,"Ever since Bitcoin had an upgrade into Bitcoin Cash on 1st August 2017, I have been bullish for Bitcoin Cashs long term future. As follows are my personal opinions on why I feel Bitcoin Cash is the future of digital cash over the legacy Bitcoin. Better Security  Bitcoin has a vulnerability called RBF which increases the risk of double spending. Bitcoin Cash developers aim to make 0-confirmation transactions safe again so that anyone accepting Bitcoin Cash is much safer accepting payments without having to wait for multiple confirmations. Improved Scalability  Bitcoin is limited to 1MB block size and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x whereas the upgraded Bitcoin Cash blocks capacity is currently at 8x with no limitations. This means Bitcoin Cash can handle Visa/Mastercard transactions volume in the future with another upgrade. Supply Scarcity  During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash from unsupported exchanges and wallets among other reasons. This means each Bitcoin Cash is actually more scarce than the legacy Bitcoin. Improved Confirmation Times  Due to the limited block size of Bitcoin, some users were made to wait days for their transactions to be confirmed. Contrast this to Bitcoin Cash where transactions may be accepted immediately with less risk and you can see why it makes sense to use Bitcoin Cash. In other words, if you are a shop owner and you just sold a cup of coffee and some sandwiches, and you accept the old legacy Bitcoin, you may have to wait hours for the transaction to be confirmed because the customer may use RBF to void the original payment. With Bitcoin Cash, your risk is minimized. Low Fees  One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over traditional payment methods is the low fees. Due to the limited block size of Bitcoin, fees have reached as much as $70/transaction during peak period. On the other hand, I have never paid more than 1 penny/transaction during my entire time in using Bitcoin Cash. This makes using Bitcoin Cash ideal for merchants, businesses, companies and everyday usage. The industries that may be disrupted such as Remittances, Payment Gateways, etc are worth trillions of dollars and Bitcoin Cash is well positioned for use cases in these industries. At the moment, the old legacy Bitcoin has network effects advantages just like how Friendster used to dominate the social networking space. Since Bitcoin Cash was only out for 2 months, it would remain to be seen how much time would be needed to play catch up. It took Facebook years to catch up to Friendsters dominance back then and it may take Bitcoin Cash just as long to achieve the same. Source: URL"

88,vulnerability,btc,A sane explanation of what segwit is and is not -- for the confused,0,727zih,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/727zih/a_sane_explanation_of_what_segwit_is_and_is_not/,2017-09-25 07:35:11,"/u/Aro2220 asked for a real explanation to clarify some things he had misunderstood about segwit: URL I thought more people could benefit from this explanation. Obviously, some people here will disagree with my explanation, which is fine. Glad to be somewhere where real discussions and debate can happen. &gt; It is my understanding the way segwit works is it's a layer for transactions to occur off chain (run by a centralized server/system) and then big swaths of transactions are moved on Bitcoin as a kind of settlement layer at the end of the day or whatever. Oiy, no. Sorry, not trying to be rude, there's a lot of misinformation that is spread and to be honest, this stuff is kind of hard to actually understand even **without** the misinformation. I'm going to go ahead and correct a bunch of different pieces of misinformation that are common and then cover your specific example. I'm skipping over some things and simplifying some things; let me know if you want more detail. So Segwit itself isn't actually a layer of anything. Transactions are normally composed of the following: 1. &lt;input_location&gt; &lt;input_signature_data&gt; 2. (1 is repeated N times for N inputs) 3. &lt;output_amount&gt; &lt;output_signature_requirements&gt; 4. (3 is repeated M times for M outputs) You can see this in action in this random transaction I picked: URL It has 5 inputs and 2 outputs. If you scroll down, blockchain.info lists the signature data for inputs under ""Input Scripts"" and it lists the signature data for outputs under ""Output Scripts"". You don't need to understand it, just see what I mean. There's also a tiny bit more data that I'm ignoring for brevity(lol, brevity). Also notice how much larger the text on each ""inputs"" section is than the ""outputs"" section; The input section takes up a lot more bytes of space. There has always been one type of transaction in Bitcoin that did not require an input script: the ""anyone-can-spend"" transaction type. So long as the output is of that anyone-can-spend type, all modern versions of the software would accept that input without a signature. What segwit does fundamentally is that it takes the &lt;input_signature_data&gt; blocks, which are by far the largest part of most transactions, and moves them to a new location called the witness data block. So now it looks like this: 1. &lt;input_location&gt; ~~&lt;REMOVED&gt;~~ 2. (1 is repeated N times for N inputs) 3. &lt;output_amount&gt; &lt;output_signature_requirements&gt; 4. (3 is repeated M times for M outputs) Witness data section: 1. &lt;input_signature_data&gt; Splitting the input signature data out of the transaction is the most common solution to the transaction malleability problem, which I'll cover more in a moment. Despite what is commonly repeated here in /r/btc, this signature data is still present and is still required. Also despite what used to be commonly repeated here in /r/btc, segwit transactions can't be stolen via the ""anyone-can-spend"" rules as Segwit actually changed the meaning of the rule and reverting that would require the same things as any other attempt to steal coins. This rule change is how Segwit could be done as a soft fork (which I personally believe it absolutely should not have been, but that's neither here nor there). So as you can see, this simply changes the structure of the transaction. This moved information still winds up hashed into the header (through the miner's block reward transaction) so the ""chain of signatures"" of Bitcoin is still preserved. Now, how does all of this relate back to the 2nd layer and settlement layer stuff? Great question, bear with me, I know this is long. Blockstream has hired or has close ties with the majority of Bitcoin Core developers, and they have two products that create a ""layer 2"" of Bitcoin, though only one of those seems like it could make a profit for them. Liquid I know little about but it seems like mostly vaporware thus far. Lightning is the one everyone talks about. Lightning relies on Bitcoin's multiple-signer transactions to create a system where two people can trade money back and forth as many times as they want without putting money at risk of theft by either party. Basically, both parties lock up x and y BTC inside multi-sig transactions and trade signatures back and forth as they exchange money; At any given moment someone can send their latest multi-sig-transaction and get the money that the other party last agreed they had back. All of this can be done without segwit at all; Segwit simply makes the process better, easier, and more powerful by fixing the issue known as transaction malleability, and most solutions for transaction malleability require that the signature data is separated from the transaction anyway. Lightning is a system of interlocking those channels between two people to connect everyone else indirectly. All in all, it is fairly clever, but has numerous issues and limitations as well. So Segwit, itself, is not a layer of anything, it is just a change to transaction structures and the definitions of opcodes. And it doesn't run anything offchain that couldn't be done anyway. So where did that idea come from? The answer is a little more complex, but it goes back to the people who created Segwit and Lightning, and how Segwit came about to begin with. Many people have known for a long time that the Bitcoin blocksize limit was going to be reached and needed to be raised. However, raising that limit means that running a Bitcoin full node will cost more in terms of storage, CPU, and bandwidth. The pro-core group of people have convinced themselves that running a full node is the only way to ensure that Bitcoin doesn't get taken over by corporations or governments, and they are convinced that miners are likely already compromised and therefore working against Bitcoin. The Bitcoin Core developer group heavily subscribes to this view. In 2015 the scaling debate was raging between the Bitcoin developers who wanted Bitcoin to scale with a blocksize increase and those who didn't. The contingent opposed has remained basically the same; In 2013 Peter Todd stated he wanted to avoid even the precedent of a successful blocksize increase. Luke-Jr wants to decrease the blocksize. Maxwell said he thinks that the blocksize should never be increased. Most of the other core developers are moderate in that they state it should be increased ""at some point"" with substantial planning and consensus, but they have taken zero steps to lay out that planning or a timeline of any sort other than segwit; Their actions put a lie to their words. Segwit itself came about only after BitcoinXT threatened to split off. The core developers created a series of ""scaling Bitcoin"" conferences at which no concrete plan proposals were allowed to be discussed, and proposed Segwit as a way to increase the blocksize without establishing the precedent of a successful hardfork increase. The core developers who actually wanted to increase the blocksize were attacked and smeared incessantly, and all of them quit or moved on. Core also created a conference where they signed an agreement to torpedo Bitcoin Classic(another even smaller hardfork proposal) and then reneged on the agreement. The Core developers see (and want) a future of high on-chain fees that force users to use layer-2 solutions like Lightning. The author of Lightning said fees will be over $1000 on-chain and that's just fine with him. Segwit is a piece of that journey simply because it a) contributes to the illusion that Core actually wants Bitcoin to scale which is essential for the brainwashed masses in censorship-land, b) it was an acceptable compromise between the most anti-increase members of Core and the moderate members of Core, and c) it enables some additional features of Lightning and other layer 2 solutions through its malleability fix and versioning additions. The second layer stuff is where potential centralization creeps in. I don't know about Liquid, but Lightning is in theory decentralized, but in practice it is very unlikely to be because it creates numerous trade-offs that encourage users to congregate around hubs, and those hubs become the centralized vulnerability that Bitcoin was supposed to avoid. Ironically despite Core's fears about node costs and mining centralization, Ethereum has scaled farther than Bitcoin for less cost, with more full nodes, AND less miner centralization. tl;dr: 1. Segwit changes the transaction structure around, it isn't 2nd layer or centralized 2. 2nd layer can exist without segwit; segwit makes it better by providing an ""optional"" malleability fix 3. Neither segwit nor 2nd layer are inherently evil; 4. The bad part comes because Core wants to **force** everyone to use the second layer through excessive fees. 5. 2nd layer is likely to become centralized and allow Blockstream to profit from their takeover of development.

This rate of increase is safely under the long term efficiency gains we see in processing, storage, and broadband over decades. This approach keeps those who believe ""full nodes"" should be affordable and decentralized within the price range of hobbyists in first world countries. It avoids the ideological divide over those who believe ""full nodes"" are unnecessary and miners are all that's needed (because nodes in the white paper were miners back when CPU mining worked), and those that fear network hubs (aka full nodes) could be targets for regulation or censorship by authorities if Bitcoin gets really big. There are good arguments either way, but splitting the community that overall wants Bitcoin to scale is not worth it. If somehow long term trends like Moore's Law break down, we can hard fork when that happens. *Why is this important?* If Bitcoin Cash takes over as Bitcoin, the same nefarious influences that took over Bitcoin 1x will turn their sites on BCC. BIP100 and other approaches that let miners ""vote"" are flawed. BIP100 only requires 25% hashpower to block scaling forever, because 75% must agree to an increase over an extended period to increase the blocksize at all. Math based scaling as suggested by Satoshi back in 2010 is the way to go, and the best way to peg that scaling is to look at long term trends like NIelson's and Moore's Laws. BIP101 does this. We will likely never have to revisit the ""blocksize debate"" again, and this critical vulnerability will forever be removed from Bitcoin. **BIP101 is the perfect compromise that eliminates human ability to use ""magic numbers"" or ""voting"" to stop Bitcoin.** We also need to make sure the 32MB network message limit scales alongside BIP101. **2) Revisit EDA after the November hard fork.** The inflation we are seeing with EDA is inconsequential compared to its benefit, but we need it to adjust both ways.

96,vulnerability,btc,Let's talk about Lightning Networks,57,6wtlob,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6wtlob/lets_talk_about_lightning_networks/,2017-08-30 05:28:16,"I've been doing a lot of research about Lightning over the last few days and wanted to make a post here to help people understand what it is and what it does and why it won't help Bitcoin. I should mention that all of the information I'm providing here is *my best understanding of these systems*. Although I am making effort to be as factual as possible, please step in if I'm missing or outdated on any information because I believe it's important for people to know what they're possibly getting themselves into. First things first, Lightning Network was and is being developed by Blockstream who is a private corporation. You can see their 2015 announcement about Lightning Network [here](URL Second, Blockstream currently has a defensive patent related to sidechain technology which you can see information about [here](URL Lightning Network requires a sidechain in order to function which means that it will effectively be patented by Blockstream regardless of who implements it. ""Sidechain"" is the important thing to think about here. And finally, Blockstream explains how they will defend their sidechain patent [here](URL but saying things like: &gt;Our Patent Pledge assures developers and users of our technology that we will not sue them for patent infringement, **provided they comply with the terms and conditions of our pledge**... If Blockstream truly wanted sidechain technology to be open and free for use by anyone then they would release their patent as an open-source project instead of working to maintain control over it. **So what is a Lightning Network?** It's a cryptocurrency exchange system that takes place on a separate blockchain that allows users to open channels and trade within those channels freely in a location outside of the Bitcoin blockchain in order to avoid fees and lower the block size. When the channel is closed by both parties, the accounts ""settle up"" with the Bitcoin blockchain. Fees are paid to the miners on the first and last transactions only. **How does a channel work?** To open a channel, each party will have to agree to open it together. A channel must be opened with a transaction that takes place on the blockchain at which point one or both parties involved will ""deposit"" an amount of BTC into their channel for trading which is currently capped at roughly 0.042 BTC. Once the BTC is inside the channel, it can move back and forth between those two parties. It is unclear how many confirmations will be required on the Bitcoin blockchain in order to LN to allow transfers between parties in a channel. **Does this help me buy a coffee with Bitcoin?** The short answer is no. This does not simplify one-off or customer-merchant transactions in any way. In fact, it's worse than the system as-is because it requires **two** transactions to take place on the blockchain for you to fully send and receive Bitcoin. And yes, that means **two** miner's fees *and* whatever fees the LN charges. **So why are people excited about it?** The one function of Lightning Network that's interesting is that if you have a channel open with a ""node"" and that node has a channel open with someone you want to do a transaction with, you can transfer funds through that node without opening a new channel. You are theoretically able to do multiple ""hops"" through the network as long as every node you're ""hopping"" through to make a transaction has enough BTC in their account to cover the amount you want to send or receive(as well as every other transaction happening on the network). And here is where things break down. Opening and closing a 1 to 1 channel is useless because it requires more transactions than would normally be required which means waiting even longer for transactions to confirm on the already maxed out blocks. When you want to close a channel(settle the accounts) **all users involved in transactions on that channel will have to be online**. That means if you do a transaction that takes 6 hops to send money to some dude in Nantucket for an eBay purchase, every single person in between you and him would have to be online in order to provide their private key on the transaction. If one person is not online when you send the signal to close, nothing will happen because they aren't available to sign the transaction with their private key and your funds will be unavailable. For Lightning Network to function, it essentially means that any funds that you add to Lightning Network will have to stay on Lightning Network. It means that the miners who support the BTC blockchain now are going to be denied the very transaction fees that incentivise them to continue doing that work. It seems that the dream of the people who are developing this system is that large scale ""banks"" or individuals with enough BTC that they can effectively run a channel hub so that people can connect to hubs instead of other individuals. Nobody has said what fees these hubs will charge(or the creators of the LN) and nobody seems to want to talk about the fact that, even if you're using a hub to make a transaction with someone else on the same hub, it will still require 2 transactions on the Blockchain. What's worse is that Lightning Network is open to HUGE attack vulnerability because an individual with a large amount of BTC can simply turn their hub off at any time and anyone who has made a transaction through that hub and not closed their channel will be completely unable to access their funds until the hub is turned back on. Placing your BTC onto a Lightning Network is almost worse than an exchange because there could be **dozens** of people between you and your BTC and, if any one of them goes offline for an extended period of time, there's no way for you to access your Bitcoin outside of the network. Meanwhile, the miners who literally *are* the Bitcoin blockchain are going to be denied the very thing that keeps them working and supporting the network. Lightning Network is a solution looking for a problem being built by a corporation using patented technology with unknown fees and over-inflated promises. If I were the Bitcoin community, I would be running far away from this system, not embracing it. It is a move toward centralization, it weakens the security of the blockchain and takes money out of the pockets of the miners. Despite all of these facts, there is no indication that fees to users will be reduced, transactions will be faster or that it will make cryptocurrencies more accessible to new users."

The way prediction markets operate today resemble gambling rather than investing. There is no underlying asset to extract value from after the bet has been settled. The main vulnerability of prediction markets is the need for a trusted third party to settle the bet. While one could try to decentralize the platform that is used for bets, the way the outcome of the event is decided is still a point of failure in the system. The solution to the problems mentioned above is to turn future events into digital commodities. To understand how to do so in full, please read the following [article](URL In short, by utilizing bitcoin blockchain it is now possible to commodify and interlink any event imaginable, including future events. The platform that used to commodify the events is [counterparty](URL Counterparty resides on top of bitcoin, which means that all digital assets that are created via counterparty gain the security of the bitcoin network. Counterparty contributes to the bitcoin ecosystem by creating an additional use case  each counterparty transaction has to include a btc fee. *** **Future Events As Digital Commodities:** By following the instructions specified in the 'constructing universal map of knowledge' [article](URL one can become an owner of a future event asset. Because future events are treated as digital commodities, price discovery mechanism becomes one of the tools used to predict the outcome of an particular event. The greater market value an asset that anchors a version of a future event has, the greater probability that the event it anchors will occur in the future. One of the major features of the counterparty protocol is a decentralized exchange. The decentralized exchange removes the need to trust a third party to facilitate the trading of future event assets. The assets are always under the control of the traders, and the transactions are secured by bitcoin network. Unlike traditional prediction markets, asset based prediction markets are not a zero sum game. Events that did not occur in 'consensus reality' could still have value as being part of an alternative timeline. Fictional/simulated timelines and the events that happen in them can be registered as independent events and be a part of a larger construct. *** **Value:** The value of event assets is largely based on the fact that they are highly resistant to forgery. In general (and as previously [explained](URL the invention of bitcoin technology is the invention of digital scarcity. Bitcoin was created to allow people to send digital information between each other in form of a token (btc). None of the participants can retain a valid copy of a token after the transaction has been made and there is no need to trust a centralized service to validate the transactions. All the transaction are recorded on a distributed public ledger. The fundamental value of a distributed public ledger is the secure environment it provides that allows people to publish/send certain information without trusting any third party. Information that has been written into the ledger is automatically timestamped, anyone can view it and nobody can modify it. Centralized services cannot provide objective timestamping simply by design, information can be edited by service operators and they are easier to attack. In order to record the information into the distributed public ledger, a fee is paid to the those who invest resources to secure it (bitcoin miners). The objectivity of a distributed public ledger is measured by the amount of resources the attacker has to use in order to undermine its integrity. When counterparty is used to create event assets, the events assets are objectively timestpamed and secured by bitcoin network. The timestamping is used to differentiate between particular events. The first to capture the event is the event owner. *** **Authentication:** Today we use physical objects as anchor points to culturally significant events. Physical objects have to be authenticated by experts in order to maintain their relevance and value. One cannot be completely certain that the object itself is authentic because there is a need to trust a third party. The process of authentication without the need to trust any third party is built into the counterparty protocol. That means that digital assets become more concrete representation of events, because they are more easily authenticated than physical objects. Additionally, culturally significant events that have no physical anchor points can now have digital objects to serve that purpose. It can easily be verified when a particular event was first recorded and there is no need to trust a centralized service to do so. *** **Connections:** The 'constructing universal map of knowledge' article, described how to connect event assets in a two-way link via value communication. The greater quality connections future event assets have, the greater predictive power they gain. A greater insight could be derived from observing the connections of future events, as future events can be connected by 'if/then' type of branching structure. Event assets owners have economic incentive to connect their events to future events that they believe have higher probability to occur as it could increase the value of the assets they own. The owners that don't protect the integrity of the information associated to the event assets, including the validity of connections, will risk the decline of monetary value of their assets. This is the main economic incentive that will insure the existence of reliable information, essentially putting an end the 'fake news'/'post truth' era. *** **Conclusion:** Having insight into future events and access to reliable information could improve our decision making ability and benefit humanity as a whole."

This article focuses on pathological narcissism and narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), with the aim of exploring two clinically relevant aspects of narcissistic functioning also recognized in psychoanalysis: fear and decision-making. Evidence from neuroscientific studies of related conditions, such as psychopathy, suggests links between affective and cognitive functioning that can influence the sense of self-agency and narcissistic self-regulation. Attention can play a crucial role in moderating fear and self-regulatory deficits, and the interaction between experience and emotion can be central for decision-making. In this review we will explore fear as a motivating factor in narcissistic personality functioning, and the impact fear may have on decision-making in people with pathological narcissism and NPD. Understanding the processes and neurological underpinnings of fear and decision-making can potentially influence both the diagnosis and treatment of NPD. Keywords: narcissistic personality disorder, psychopathy, fear, decision-making, somatic marker hypothesis, psychoanalysis Introduction Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) has its roots in nearly a century of psychoanalytic studies. Kernberg's1,2 and Kohut's3,4 groundbreaking efforts to organize psychoanalytic theory and clinical studies into comprehensive descriptions and treatment strategies moved NPD towards recognition as a separate personality disorder. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV,5,6 NPD has been characterized as a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy, with interpersonal entitlement, exploitativeness, arrogance, and envy. Other notable phenotypic characteristics include interpersonal distancing and avoidance, insecurity and vulnerability, hypersensitivity, aggressivity, and proneness to shame.7-9 The transformation of NPD into a DSM diagnostic category in 198010 required significant adjustments and narrowing of extensive clinical observations. Several components and characteristics of narcissistic personalitypathology that were central in the psychoanalytic conceptualization of narcissism and NPD were left aside in the final choice and formulation of the diagnostic trait criteria. One such characteristic relates to the process and feeling of fear, frequently acknowledged in psychoanalytic studies as a significant part of narcissistic pathology. Freud11 noted narcissistic mortification as intense fear associated with narcissistic injury and humiliation. He also observed the shocking reaction when individuals face the discrepancy between an endorsed or ideal view of the self and a drastically contrasting realization.12 Rothstein13 associated such fear of falling short of ideals with the loss of perfection and accompanying humiliation, an important aspect of narcissistic personality functioning. Fiscalini14 emphasized fear of autonomy in narcissistic interpersonal relations, and Kohut4,15 pointed to fear associated with rejection, isolation, and loss of contact with reality, and loss of admiration, equilibrium, and important objects. Recently, Horowitz16 highlighted fear in the context of wishes and defenses, and Kernberg17-19 has referred to the unfolding of underlying fear in treatment of people with NPD, including fear of dependency and destroying the relationship with the analyst, fear of retaliation, of one's own aggression and destructiveness, and fear of death. Maldonado20 identified the narcissistic intrapsychic trauma caused by the loss of a bond with a good object associated with ideals and meaning. Such a trauma threatens the individual's sense of continuity, coherence, stability, and wellbeing. In the delicate balance between repairing such traumas and working through conflicts, reactivations of fear inevitably occur, especially in the context of aggression and shame. An additional limitation in DSM is the absence of diagnostically specified levels of personality functioning. Narcissism ranges from healthy and proactive to pathological and malignant. Consequently, pathological narcissism and NPD often co-occur with consistent or intermittent areas and periods of high functioning,21 including areas or periods of real competence and qualities, as well as cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal capabilities, and social skills. In clinical and social psychological reports, identification of narcissistic character pathology takes into consideration the functional aspects of shifts between selfenhancement and self -deflation, with intermittent periods and areas of competent functioning. Dimensions of character functioning that enable such evaluation include selfagency22-25 and self-directedness.26 These dimensions, which capture the individual's intentions, choices and strivings, purpose and goals, causal influence, and prediction and problem-solving skills, are especially useful for defining narcissistic self- and self-esteem regulation. Decision-making, a central component in self -regulatory and self-directing efforts, has gained attention in psychoanalytic studies, and recently also in social psychological studies of narcissism. In order to advance our understanding of the different components operating in pathological narcissism and NPD it is necessary to further connect and integrate the psychoanalytic and clinical, as well as the social psychological, conceptualization of the disorder. One unifying approach may be to examine the neural underpinnings in narcissism as a way to refine its phenotype. Research on empathy and empathic functioning has alreadyproven such a link to be most constructive and informative for NPD,27-29 contributing to a significant change in identifying empathy, not as absent or present, but as a multifactorial and fluctuating capability.30 This research has also influenced the discussion of the DSM-5 personality disorder section, suggesting that empathy is an ability with inconsistencies and impairments, multiple components, a functional range, and a regulatory role. The aim of this paper is to further identify possible links between the psychoanalytic perspective on pathological narcissism and NPD, and neuroscientific research on narcissism and related pathologies. In this review, we will focus primarily on fear, as it has been considered a central and even a motivating factor in narcissistic personality functioning in psychoanalytic and clinical studies. Further, we will explore the impact that fear may have on decision-making. Understanding the processes and neurological underpinnings of fear and decision-making can potentially influence both the diagnosis and treatment of NPD. Fear Fear is generally considered to be an emotional state, a psychological and psychophysiological response to perceived or anticipated threats or danger. Fear can often serve as an adaptive alert and survival mechanism. As such, it represents an ability to recognize danger and an urge to either confront or to avoid or escape, but fear can also in extreme situations cause paralysis and inability to protect oneself. Fear differs from anxiety as it is a response to real threats, a frightening object, event, or experience, while anxiety is considered an anticipatory warning signal, related to the expectation of unreal or imagined danger, including intrapsychic, unconscious conflicts and erotic feelings.31-34 From a psychoanalytic perspective, fear can be triggered by concrete external events as well as by internal subjective or emotional experiences. Fear of not measuring up and falling short can be triggered in specific situations, ie, in the context of evaluation, performance, or exposure. Such fear differs from the more complex or ambiguous fear that in the same way can threaten self-esteem, ie, fear of being overwhelmed, and facing success or relationships and intimacy, feelings of shame or guilt, and experiencing loss of control.23,32,35,36 The subjective meaning ascribed to the experience of external life events, such as changes, gains and losses, challenges, or discouragements, can evoke sudden unexpected fear. Intense overwhelming affect, independently of whether the cause is external or internal, can also in itself be terrifying as it may challenge the individual's sense of internal control. Fear can also become maladaptive or pathological, as such feelings, generated from an initial fear-provoking event, persist and have a negative effect on day-to-day behavior.37 Fear of dark and negative self-experiences or of intolerable aspects of identity, in particular, can drive protective self-aggrandizement as well as destructive suicidal behavior enforced by overwhelming feelings of despair.23,38 Certain events can also activate fears associated with earlier narcissistic trauma. Experiences in the present are linked to disorganized and fragmented memories of earlier mortifying or traumatic experiences. Sensory and emotional experiences associated with such early trauma39 also contribute to the subjective perception and interpretation of a present event as traumatic, ie, retraumatizing. A number of social psychological and personalityfocused studies related to narcissistic functioning further indicate that fear and fear avoidance, especially of failure, are important motivating factors, a self -regulatory strategy driven by specific achievement motives, namely, fear of failure (p 11).40 Those strategies involve achievement, competitiveness, improvement of performance, and perfectionism.40-42 Similarly, fear of failure and accompanying shame can motivate procrastination or avoidance of commitment and performance.43,44 On the other hand, fear management can also involve selfenhancing risk-taking and impulsivity.24,45 Defensive behavior in response to exposure to failure and accompanying fear of failure is considered to be deeply ingrained, with automatic efforts to avoid failure. In general, these studies indicate that people who are afraid of failing can be motivated or even susceptible to either invest greater efforts in a task after being exposed to failure information, or to completely avoid such efforts. Fear related to self-esteem regulation and risk of falling short can underlie and motivate a range of behavior in narcissistic personality disorder. High achievements can be motivated by fear of incompetence and failure; selfenhancement by fear of worthlessness and inferiority; perfectionism by fear of shame and self-criticism; pursuit of special affiliations by fear of losing status or influence; interpersonal ignorance and distancing by fear of humiliation, or being overpowered and lose control; and avoidance by fear of shame and exposure. These studies and observations raise several questions about the interaction between identifying, processing, and controlling fear from the perspective of narcissistic self-regulation. So far, studies have shown that people with high narcissism but not meeting criteria for NPD present with higher degree of alexithymia, ie, difficulties assessing own and other's emotions.46 However, it is possible that by exploring neuroscientific evidence in narcissism and related pathologies, researchers and clinicians may begin to clarify and differentiate specific fear susceptibility and fear processing in people with NPD. Fear, narcissism, and neuroscience Over the last several decades there has been significant growth in the understanding of the neurobiological basis of fear. At the center of the fear circuitry is the amygdala. The amygdala mediates processes such as the detection of emotionally arousing and/or salient stimuli.47 Additional regions (eg, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, some prefrontal regions, etc) form a neural network involved in the perception of threat, fear learning, and fear expression.48 These areas individually mediate symptoms of fear and collectively act to produce an integrated fear response. Our nuanced understanding of this complex neural network results from imaging (eg, during fear conditioning studies), physiological (eg, skin conductance, eye-blink response), and psychopharmacological studies that not only enhance the mechanistic understanding of fear but also highlight the role of fearrelated dysfunction in the generation and maintenance of various forms of psychopathology. Failure to properly regulate fear responses is central to specific phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety, and some Axis II disorders (ie, fear of separation and loss of support in dependent personality disorder (DPD) of abandonment in borderline personality disorder (BPD), and of criticism, disapproval, and rejection in avoidant personality disorder (APD).6 While some disorders are largely associated with hyperviglance and an over-reactive fear response (eg, anxiety disorders and BPD), others are related to deficient fear reactivity (eg, psychopathy). Studies on the relationship between fear and narcissism have been sparse, both at a phenotypic and mechanism level. One study of individuals with narcissistic traits, as measured by the Narcissism Personality Inventory (NPI)49 reported that they display diminished electrodermal reactivity to aversive stimuli,50 indicating weak responses to punishment or aversive cues. Despite the limited research directly examining fear and narcissism, there are studies of other related conditions with relevance to pathological narcissism that highlight the importance of fear in the expression of psychopathology. Specifically, the role of fear in psychopathy-related disinhibition has been the focus of studies for decades. NPD and psychopathy are considered to be overlapping constructs, both expressing symptoms of grandiosity, compromised empathic functioning, and callousness. In fact, Kernberg2 suggested that narcissism might be the core of psychopathy.51-53 Psychopathic individuals generally display an inability to form genuine relationships; limited (ie, grandiose) affective processing, especially with respect to anticipatory anxiety and remorse; an impulsive behavioral style involving a general failure to evaluate anticipated actions and inhibit the inappropriate ones; and a chronic antisocial lifestyle that entails great costs to society as well as for the affected individual.54 While both affective and behavioral characteristics are important elements of psychopathy, the affective deficits have traditionally been considered to be the root cause of the psychopath's problems. Affective deficits in psychopathy have most often been understood in the context of the low-fear model.55 Consistent with this model, psychopaths display poor fear conditioning,55 minimal electrodermal response in anticipation of aversive events,56 and a lack of startle potentiation while viewing unpleasant versus neutral pictures.57 However, other studies examining startle potentiation (eg, fear-potentiated startle and emotionmodulated startle) demonstrate that the psychopathy-related fear deficit is not absolute, but rather conditional depending on contextual variables.58-60 Neuroimaging evidence suggests that psychopaths display reduced amygdala activation than controls during aversive conditioning, moral decision-making, social cooperation, and reduced memory for emotionally salient words.61-64 However, results from imaging studies focused on the amygdala are ambiguous. Other research indicates that the amygdala is hyper-reactive when psychopaths view certain emotionally salient scenes.65 Thus, existing research does not indicate the presence of a reliable fear deficit in psychopathic individuals, though such deficits may be revealed under specific circumstances. One explanation for the inconsistent nature of psychopathy-related fear deficits may involve an abnormality in attentional processes. Developments in neuroscience indicate that the function of the amygdala is more complex than just fear processing, and likely plays a significant role in attention and in detecting relevance.66 With regard to psychopathy, according to the response modulation hypothesis, attention plays a crucial role in moderating fear and self-regulatory deficits. Response modulation involves the temporary suspension of a dominant response set and a brief concurrent shift of attention from the organization and implementation of goal-directed responding to its evaluation (p 717). 67 In the absence of normal response modulation, an individual is prone to ignore crucial contextual information needed to evaluate his or her behavior and exercise adaptive self-regulation.68-69 Consequently, psychopaths are oblivious to potentially meaningful peripheral information because they fail to reallocate attention while engaged in goal-directed behavior. This difficulty balancing demands to process goal-directed and peripheral information creates a bias whereby psychopaths are unresponsive to information unless it is a central aspect of their goal-directed focus of attention. An important implication of the response modulation hypothesis is that the emotion deficit of psychopathic individuals varies as a function of attentional focus. A recent experiment by Newman et al60 involving fearpotentiated startle (FPS) provides striking support for this hypothesis. Of note, existing evidence suggests that FPS is generated via the amygdala.70 The task used in this study required participants to view and categorize letter stimuli that could also be used to predict the administration of electric shocks. Instructions engaged either a goal-directed focus on threat-relevant information (ie, the color that predicted electric shocks) or an alternative, threat-irrelevant dimension of the letter stimuli (ie, upper/lower case of the letter or its match/mismatch in a 2-back task). The results provided no evidence of a psychopathy-related deficit in FPS under conditions that focused attention on the threat-relevant dimension. However, psychopathy scores were significantly and inversely related to FPS under conditions that required participants to focus on a threat-irrelevant dimension of stimuli (ie, when threat cues were peripheral). In a follow-up study, Baskin-Sommers and colleagues59 specified this attentional-mediated abnormality in a new sample of offenders by measuring FPS in four conditions that crossed attentional focus (threat versus alternative focus) with early versus late presentation of goal-relevant cues. First, the authors replicated the key findings reported by Newman et al60: that psychopaths' deficit in FPS was virtually nonexistent under conditions that focused attention on the threat-relevant dimension of the experimental stimuli (ie, threat-focus conditions), but was pronounced when threat-relevant cues were peripheral to their primary focus of attention (ie, alternative-focus conditions). More specifically, the psychopathic deficit in FPS was only apparent in the early alternative focus condition, in which threat cues were presented after the alternative goal-directed focus was already established. These results confirm the idea that attention moderates the fearlessness of psychopathic individuals and, moreover, implicate an early attention bottleneck as a proximal mechanism for deficient response modulation in psychopathy (see ref 71 for discussion of the bottleneck). Additionally, Larson and colleagues (unpublished data) recently completed an imaging study using this paradigm with an independent sample of inmates. Results indicated that decreased amygdala activation in psychopathic offenders occurred only during the early alternative focus condition. Under this condition, psychopaths also exhibited greater activation in selective attention regions of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) than nonpsychopaths, and this increased LPFC activation was associated with decreased amygdala activation. In contrast, when explicitly attending to threat, amygdala activation in psychopaths did not differ from nonpsychopaths. This pattern of amygdala activation closely parallels results for FPS and, moreover, highlights the potential role of LPFC in mediating the failure of psychopathic individuals to process emotion and other important information when it is peripheral to the primary focus of goal-directed attention. Overall, it appears that psychopathic individuals do ignore fear-related information, but only in the service of focusing on a specific goal. For example, such an inflexible focus on personal goals may underlie the selfcentered, callous traits associated with psychopathy and may leave psychopathic individuals oblivious to the potentially devastating consequences of their behavior. While one relationship between fear and psychopathology is related to deficient fear processing, another relationship between fear and psychopathology is related to over-reactivity to fear. Specifically, research on other forms of externalizing psychopathology, like borderline personality disorder, report increased FPS during instructed fear conditioning72 and increased amygdala activity while viewing emotional slides.73 Similarly, studies of trait externalizing demonstrated significant increases in FPS, amygdala, and emotion-related prefrontal cortex activity during fear conditioning.74 Thus, these individuals appear unable to regulate their reaction to fear, essentially becoming consumed by its presence, ultimately resulting in a cascade of emotion-driven disinhibited behavior. Although this neuroscientific overview applies to near neighbor psychopathologies, several findings introduce possible links to fear processing in pathological narcissism and NPD. Similar to people with psychopathy, focused attention on goals, such as ambitions, competition, and aspirations, and even on risk-taking efforts, may, for some people with pathological narcissism and NPD, enable ignorance of fear and serve as a fear modulator. The narcissistic individual's awareness is then directed away from potential triggers of feelings of fear and towards more securing or rewarding self-enhancing experiences. On the other hand, given the psychoanalytic observations of profound fear in NPD, and the recognition of the thin-skinned75 and vulnerable narcissistic personality types,9 the question is whether some people with pathological narcissism and NPD indeed are hypersensitive or over-reactive to fear, or can have impaired capability to tolerate and/or process feelings of fear. It is also possible that when people with pathological narcissism or NPD have to face fear without the possibilities of engaging in avoiding, goal-directed, or self-enhancing strategies, the experience becomes overwhelming and consuming, forcing drastic decisions with seemingly immediate short-term gains. Further research is needed to parse these possibilities. One avenue for understanding the role of fear in narcissism is to examine its impact on functionality, in processes such as decision-making. Decision-making Psychoanalytic studies have primarily attended to the intrapsychic aspects of decision making. Identified as a secondary ego process linked between motivation and action, the unconscious courses involved in decision-making have nevertheless been a prime focus of interest.76,77 Used to institute defenses and reach resolutions or compromises, decision-making is also influenced by physiological factors, and part of symptom formation and psychopathology. Fear can influence decision-making by engulfing either an individual's sense of agency or sense of identity, or both. The former can affect competence, while the latter can cause self-confusion and uncertainty about who one really is. Although not currently acknowledged as a diagnostic or clinical indicator of NPD, nevertheless, remarkable lapses in some narcissistic individuals' decisions can force them into unbearable situations and life crises that call for urgent need of intensive treatment. Sometimes such lapses can have devastating consequences, including suicide.78 In clinical settings, therapists can face a paradoxical discrepancy between such patients' consistent self-control and proactive competence, and their sudden disparate decision strategies that seem ruled by immediate short-term gain and misjudgment, or by ignorance of salient negative or even destructive consequences, especially in interpersonal or professional/financial areas. Usually referred to either as narcissistic crises or trauma motivated by urgent, defensive push for protection and enhancement of self-esteem, or by avoidance of perceived inevitable ultimatums, many of the roots and underpinnings for such decision-making are still relatively unknown. As with fear, there is an important normal aspect of decision-making, especially its role in self-esteem regulation and sense of control, that contributes to an organizing perception of being in charge of cause-effect, input-outcome, and action-result. In particular, efforts to optimize reward, self-enhancement, and self-promotion have proved important. Decision-making as part of an agency model for narcissistic personality functioning has been studied in social psychology in the context of approachavoidance motivation, specifically in relationships and in financial and business decisions.24,79-81 Narcissistic factors accompanying and guiding decision-making can include arrogance, overconfidence and overestimation, visibility, or impulsivity and risk taking. Contrary to lapses in decision making, some people with pathological narcissism or NPD can present with more consistent patterns of selfpromoting decision making, involving risk-taking, and disregard or ignorance of both their own and others' feelings and wellbeing. On the other hand, it is also possible that dysregulated feelings of fear can impact the decisionmaking patterns of these individuals. Decision-making, narcissism, and neuroscience In recent years, there has been a surge of research on decision making from a neuroscience perspective. Though there are a number of decision-making models, in this review we focus on a particular neurobiological theory of decision making that highlights the interaction between experience and emotion: the somatic marker hypothesis. Antonio Damasio's82 somatic marker hypothesis posits that physiological processes, such as emotion, act as signals to influence behavior. More specifically, for each experience an association between that situation and the corresponding somatic states (ie, emotions) is made. The recurrence of a particular situation triggers the reactivation of emotion-influenced neural patterns, which biases decision-making toward choices that maximize reward and minimize punishment. Damasio and others propose that the orbitofrontal cortex, specifically the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), is central to decision-making. Patients with lesions to the vmPFC display deficits in learning from previous experiences, poor decision-making, flat affect, and impairments in their ability to react to emotional situations.83 This pattern of impairment led Damasio to hypothesize that the primary dysfunction of patients with vmPFC damage was an inability to use emotions to aid in decision-making (eg, in personal, monetary, and moral domains). To test this hypothesis in an experimental context, Bechara developed the Iowa Gambling Task. This task consists of four decks of cards, each associated with varying levels of reward and punishment (two decks are low reward/low punishment [advantageous]; two decks are high reward/high punishment [disadvantageous]). In general, participants sample both the advantageous and disadvantageous decks equally, but after experiencing a number of high punishments, they shift predominantly to advantageous decks. In contrast, subjects with vmPFC damage tend to continue choosing from the disadvantageous decks. Moreover, vmPFC lesion patients did not display anticipatory emotional responses (eg, skin conductance), indicating a deficit in anticipating the emotional impact of future rewards and punishments (see ref 84 for review). Finally, individuals with lesions to the amygdala also display impairments, similar to vmPFC patients, in performance on the Iowa gambling task. However, unlike the vmPFC patients, those with amygdala lesions display impairments in registering the emotional impact of rewards and punishments, rather than the anticipation of this feedback. Ultimately, emotional states are elicited during decision-making and are represented in the brain through both cortical (eg, insular cortex; vmPFC) and subcortical pathways (eg, mesolimbic dopamine system; amygdala). Taken together, this model provides a basis for understanding how basic motivational and emotional processes are related to complex decision-making processes in a variety of contexts. Increasingly, the principles gleaned from observing decision-making deficits in patients with lesions are being applied to understanding a diverse range of pathologies in which deficits in decision-making are evident and where emotions can play a critical role. Individuals with NPD are characterized by a sense of entitlement (ie, self-serving bias), taking advantage of others for personal gain, and hypersensitivity to criticism/punishment. However, it is possible that decision-making in such context is a consequence of weak somatic markers due to the underlying defect in emotional reactivity (see above section on fear). In a study by Krusemark et al85 undergraduates who scored high on a questionnaire measure of narcissism displayed reduced brain activity for self-serving attributions following success (positive) feedback. More specifically, these individuals had decreased activity in bilateral occipital cortex, bilateral temporal cortex, left posterior parietal cortex, right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and bilateral vmPFC (see also ref 46 for similar neural patterns related to narcissism). As noted above, deficits in vmPFC are associated with poor decisionmaking, possibly because of the inability to integrate affective information from external stimuli. Based on the evidence that individuals with high narcissism displayed reduced physiological responses to arousing cues,50 the results reported by Krusemark and colleagues may suggest that they make more self-serving attributions following success because of weak stimulus registration, integration, and affective reactivity. The association between impaired decision-making and vmPFC activity has also been made with psychopathy. A number of laboratory paradigms demonstrate vmPFC-related deficits in psychopathy, such as deficits in reversal learning,86,87 and in gambling tasks.88,89 Moreover, Koenigs and colleagues90 reported that a subgroup of psychopathic offenders (ie, primary low-anxious psychopaths) performed similarly to vmPFC lesion patients in the Ultimatum and Dictator economic decision-making games. Specifically, both primary psychopaths and vmPFC lesion patients accepted fewer unfair offers in the Ultimatum game and offered lower amounts to others in the Dictator game. These results support the purported connection between psychopathy and vmPFC dysfunction. Moreover, they suggest that, as in narcissistic individuals, a deficit in integrating emotion with action may diminish the processes of self-insight and self-reflection in psychopathic individuals. Further highlighting the potential utility of the somatic marker hypothesis for understanding the decision-making patterns of those with narcissism, individuals with high narcissism display poor performance on the Iowa Gambling Task in a manner similar to those with vmPFC lesions81 and with psychopathy.91-93 Specifically, individuals with high narcissism chose significantly more from the disadvantageous decks, which provided larger immediate reward but resulted in long-term net loss. Lakey and colleagues81 suggested that narcissistic individuals are overly focused on reward, which biased the appraisals of reward and punishment, thus impeding adaptive decision-making. However, these results may also reflect impairment in the processing of negative affect (eg, fear), which often guide a shift in decision-making that would avoid repeated punishment. Though the distinction between these perspectives may seem subtle they suggest differential sources of affective decision-making impairment: one related to hypersensitivity to reward and the other related to insensitivity to negative affects. Overall, specific deficits in affect processing may contribute to this decision-making impairment in people with pathological narcissism and NPD, and future research will need to parse and specify their decision-making and affective capability. Regarding the brain mechanisms of pathological narcissism, there are multiple neural structures that overlap with decision-making processes, notably the amygdala and vmPFC. Both brain regions have been linked to narcissism, albeit currently through limited evidence. Although at this time, it is impossible to make definitive statements about the neural root of pathological narcissism, the development of theoretical models that integrate emotion and decision-making would serve to more precisely understand the self-centered, self-serving, and self-enhancing actions of narcissistic individuals. Conclusion The possible interactional patterns, both self-regulatory and neural, between fear and decision-making as outlined above, implicate the advantage of integrating clinical studies and neuroscience to improve our understanding of pathological narcissism and the diagnosis of NPD. The psychoanalytic perspective of fear and decision-making provide more in-depth conceptualizations of narcissism to which neuroscience can add important information and perspectives to further identity the intervening processes in narcissistic personality functioning. This has the potential of significantly improving the diagnosis of NPD and consequently also the treatment approach and strategies for patients with narcissistic personality functioning. Accordingly, narcissistically based decision-making may be influenced by affect dysregulation, such as hypersensitivity to fear. In addition, fear in some individuals may be accompanied by other intense feelings (ie, secondary feelings) such as shame, rage, self-hatred, etc, or by early self-esteem related traumatic experiences, making feelings of fear intolerable and therefore especially challenging to appropriately integrate in the decision process. Treatment focusing on increasing self -reflection, insight, and ability for emotion awareness and regulation would in such case potentially help to redirect or alter the narcissistic patient's decision-making. Alternatively, patients with NPD may also be overly goal-focused in the service of self-enhancement, and hence, like people with psychopathy, be unable to redirect their attention. Treatment efforts focusing on understanding and integrating vulnerability and feelings of fear in self-functioning and self-directedness would be most meaningful for these patients. Importantly, these two treatment alternatives assume that narcissistic patients possess the ability to both recognize and process feelings of fear, even though they may for various reasons be insensitive, ignorant, hypersensitive or over-reactive to fear. However, it is also possible that neurocognitive limitations in recognizing and integrating feelings of fear greatly limit decision-making capabilities. In such case treatment focusing on learning alternative strategies may be more useful, but also require the patient's motivation and realization of the necessity for change. Further research is called for to fully identify such limitations. In sum, strategies to address the role of fear and pattern of decision-making may potentially diminish the common risks for ruptures and premature termination, and ultimately promote collaborative alliance building with patients with pathological narcissism and NPD."

We CAN still have cash, only it will be a little different... By using a disposable note, preferably made from a recyclable material, a private key is imprinted in such a way that it can be read not by a camera, which would leave a gaping vulnerability, but it could be read by laser in a specialized reader. Freshly printed notes would hold common denominations of bitcoin (like cash does now). When at a shop, you insert the note into a reader and these things happen: 1. The private key is read 2. The balance is checked 3. If the balance is sufficient, a transaction is made with 2 outputs. One is the payment for the goods, the other is to a new note (the change). 4.The inserted note is destroyed (shredded) and a new note is printed. The balance can be visibly printed in ink which is the change. The highest value of a note could be the equivalent of $100. Nobody would carry their life savings in this way, but for $100 or less, the sub optimal security is fine. With this kind of cash someone would only ever have one or two notes in their pocket, every time you use a note it's destroyed (because the private key is exposed when you spend) and replaced with a change note.

A must read.,35,6s0rvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6s0rvr/traders_guide_to_bitcoin_cash_bitcoin_segwit_a/,2017-08-07 06:34:43,"URL Check this guy out: Stein Hvard Ludvigsen. This is what he said that article, link above: ""Teaser: Bitcoin Cash can not go to zero value, but Bitcoin Segwit can. To understand how to bet on Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin Segwit, I will explore the extreme edge cases, why bitcoin will converge on one chain and the fundamentals of the two chains. I consider bitcoin to be the most work chain with either the rules of Bitcoin Cash (BC) or Bitcoin Segwit (BS). Currently, this chain is BS. But it could change to BC. I am not going to dive into the differences of the two movements behind each chain, what mining is, etc. I will try to shed some light on stuff many bitcoin interested people might have not seen and give them a better platform to trade the chain split in a long term perspective. This is not a bitcoin 101 course. So I assume you know how the difficulty adjustment (DA) in bitcoin works. BC also has an emergency difficulty adjustment (EDA). EDA works like this: If there has not been mined more than 6 blocks the last 12 hours, the difficulty will be reduced by 20%. The conditions for EDA is evaluated for every block, meaning you could have several blocks in a row reducing the difficulty by 20% each time. EDA make it possible for a very fast reduction of difficulty. The game changer EDA is the game changer. The implications of it is far reaching. If EDA was not introduced in BC, I think most people would see BC in rigor mortis today. EDA is the difference between the possibility of chain death or not. So what exactly is a chain death? It is the situation where there is not enough hashpower to mine enough blocks to reach the next DA. Its just too expensive, and no point in doing it. The whole chain grinds to a halt. It is no longer possible to perform a transaction on chain. In this case, the value of the token becomes zero. Because you cant use it. (Fun fact: Maybe its possible to sell Casascius coins, but they are just collectible items and not the way bitcoin is supposed to work.) BC can not die because it has EDA. BS can die because it doesnt have EDA. BCs value can not go to zero. BSs value can go to zero. Death by Dumping is impossible It is not possible to dump a working crypto currency to death. Some whales on the BS side in the blocksize debate have suggested that they can kill BC by dumping it over a long period of time. But it is just as impossible as it is for the IMF to buy all bitcoin in the world. The dumpers will just run out of BC to dump, followed by a new price discovery. As long as the chain is maintained by miners and working, it is not possible to buy everything or dump it to zero. Convergence to one chain The bitcoin split is very different from the Ethereum split. Ethereum do DA for every block and is like EDA on steroids. This makes it possible for ETH and ETC to live side by side, one big in value, one small in value. A miner makes approximately the same whether he mines ETC or ETH. If prices change, miners shift their hashpower, difficulty change immediately on both chains and everything is back in balance. Its like if the elephant in the picture on the top of this article was standing on the ground with all four feet, while wind (price) blows on it. It just leans a little into the wind. Bitcoin is very different. Under normal conditions, its 2 weeks (2016 blocks, 10 minutes per block) between each DA. Right now, a group of miners are mining at a loss on the BC chain. They are pushing very hard against the elephant leaning against them. They do it because they want to change bitcoin and they have a long term perspective. I call this charity mining. Not because they are not greedy (they should be greedy), but because they do long term investments that could benefit all miners, not just themselves. They believe a 1MB cap on blocks is ridiculous and preventing adoption. Their goal is to hold the elephant until the next DA. They are assisted by the EDA. The heaviest work, the first 6 blocks, is already done. Some people speculate that hostile miners are mining BC to keep the hashrate above 8% to prevent the EDA to kick in. An attack like this, however, will only postpone the DA to 23 months maximum. The attacker will actually do his enemies a favor. They can just relax and mine BS with profit while the attacker holds the elephant. This elephant pushing is not sustainable. It costs a lot of money. That is why the chains will converge on one chain, unlike Ethereum. The elephant will eventually fall on its face or its ass. And its going to stay like that. Nobody can move it after the fall. Its a good thing for bitcoin as a whole. BS is very vulnerable in this asymetric game because BS doesnt have EDA. BS is under a constant threat of a gold rush when BC becomes more profitable to mine than BS. All BC-supporting miners need to do, is to lower the difficulty by mining BS until its profitable to mine BC. The fundamental differences between BC and BS The fundamentals will win the market in the long run. When its allowed to run long. Ill keep it short, but I think the fundamental differences between the chains are the following: More people using bitcoin: BC Yes, BS No Cheap transactions: BC Yes, BS No Fast transactions: BC Yes, BS No Reliable transactions: BC Yes, BS No Privacy: BC Yes, BS No (because of fees related to mixers) Fungibility: BC Yes, BS No (because of fees related to mixers) Vulnerability to dev centralization: BC No, BS Yes (BC = many teams, BS = 1) Level 2 compatibility: BC Yes (in time), BS Yes (in time) Its your decision Right now, 1 BS can buy over 10 BC.

106,vulnerability,btc,"Questions About Reality of Segwit ""Anyone Can Spend"" Vulnerability",4,6jqk5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6jqk5k/questions_about_reality_of_segwit_anyone_can/,2017-06-27 15:02:08,"Please forgive any misunderstandings. My understanding is that Segwit uses a somewhat hacky change where it repurposes what were previously ""anyone can spend"" transactions for Segwit transactions. I have heard two criticisms of this: 1. Once Segwit is accepted, and Segwit transactions have entered the block chain, the code for Segwit would be very difficult to remove from Bitcoin even if Segwit were ever deprecated. This is because old Segwit transactions would still need to be validated. 2. Once Segwit is accepted, there would be a growing incentive for a 51% attack as the number of Segwit transactions accumulated without limit. The 51% attack would be to disable Segwit, reinterpreted the Segwit transactions as ""anyone can spend"" and recoup the high costs of the attack by taking all those coins. The first criticism makes sense to me. My questions are about the validity of the second. **Disclaimers** I am not pro or con Segwit in principle and I don't know the technicalities enough to have an opinion on its implementation. *I strongly feel that it is negligent to adopt Segwit before completely addressing the immediate transaction scaling crisis. I don't think 2MB will be enough to fully address that crisis and greater increases will be required.* **Questions** Isn't a miners incentive to collude on a 51% attack that violates Bitcoin ownership balanced by the value crash that would cause? Who would buy coins from a block chain that so egregiously violated ownership? Is Segwit somehow unique in creating an incentive to violate account ownerships? It seems to me that there are an infinite number of Bitcoin rule changes that miners could use in a 51% attack to take coins, all the way up to simply taking them all or creating more or whatever. So the Segwit-reversion attack has no more incentive than other wreckless behavior. Thanks for any insights!"

I'm going out on a limb here... and suggest that mining centralization is a much bigger problem. Bare with me. **1) ASICBOOST is not the issue** I believe that the use of ASICBOOST is fair game. Sure, the Bitcoin protocol has a vulnerability. But it is not the miners job to fix vulnerabilities. The only thing miners essentially care about is profits. And to that end, it is within their rights to exploit a loophole in the network. This is just the invisible hands at work. Some might argue that the ASICBOOST exploit should be labeled as an attack on the network. I can see why someone would call it an attack, while some would call it a genius optimization. Its just a matter of perspectives. Maxwell looks at it from the developers perspective. To him, the Bitcoin protocol should be as bullet-proof as possible, free from foul plays. The miners look at it from the businesss perspective. To them, a vulnerability, as long as it doesnt harm them, is an opportunity to earn money. So I can understand both sides of the argument, and to call it an attack or just business as usual is just a matter of perspectives. But that is not what people are angry about. To bring up competition in the free market is to totally miss the larger point. Which is: **It is within the miners right to seek secret commercial advantages, but it is not within their rights to wage media campaign that obfuscates real issues and blocks technical progress.** And that is what people take issue with. A few miners have repeatedly blocked Segwit, and convinced others very loudly to do the same, without revealing the vested interest they have in the non-Segwit world. Would you ever ask a Wall Street derivative trader for advice on how to reform the derivative trading industry? Of course not! Because of the obvious conflict of interest. **The same goes for Bitcoin miners who have a vested interest in the non-Segwit world. These miners should be disqualified from making technical evaluation of Segwit.** So it was dishonest of them to wage a PR campaign to do so. Even if the ASICBOOST allegation turns out to be false, this is a valid concern from a system perspective: **Are miners ever qualified to make technical recommendations, without disclosing their conflicts of interest?** Some might argue that miners are not stupid. That they understand that if their actions harm Bitcoin, Bitcoin value will go down and they, too, will suffer. So there is no way they would act against Bitcoins interest. But this argument misses an important factor. It underestimates the amount of sunk cost miners have with the existing ASIC hardware they already invested in. This makes it difficult for them to be flexible on protocol changes. (I suspect the problem is way worse because many of these mining companies probably operate with high debt.) So in the long term, the miners interests might align with Bitcoins. But in the short term, that might not always be the case. **Whats important to point out is the information asymmetry advantage the miners enjoy. You can have valid criticisms of Core (no one is beyond criticism) and their roadmap, but at least anyone can audit Cores code changes due to the nature of open source software. You cant audit what the miners say or their intention.** A good, working free market requires the majority of participants to be able to make informed decisions. And a lot of people have been misled into making uninformed decisions due to this information asymmetry. So the lesson here is it pays to keep the miners honest. **2) Mining centralization is a bigger problem than development centralization** Jeff Garzik brought up a few interesting points in a recent [Forbes Unchained podcast](URL - Bitcoin consensus rules are similar to the US Constitution, in terms of being resistant to change by design - Bitcoin could learn from NASA use of a 9-step ladder process, called TLR to gauge technology readiness - the issue of development centralization. Regarding the issue of development centralization, it is a valid concern IMO. Generally speaking, I believe developers could be biased, in choosing what features to implement and the order in which they implement them. They might have interests that do not align with Bitcoins, e.g., due to philosophical differences between what they and others perceive Bitcoin to be. They might be bought out by unknown third parties that have ulterior motives. However, I believe this concern is mitigated by the transparent nature of open source software. All technical proposals are out in the open, and anybody can audit the intended code changes. The developers cant force the network to adopt new changes. Whats important to note is that **whatever ulterior motives developers might have, the only way they can express their intent is through code and only code**. They can say the most controversial things in the world, but code is the only means they have to actually make a meaningful impact. The worst things that can happen with development centralization are: 1. *Stagnation*: the developers started writing code that other market participants dont accept, and then no changes would be adopted. The Bitcoin protocol and network would stay stagnant. 2. *Death*: once Bitcoin gets stagnant, other alternative cryptocurrencies might leapfrog Bitcoin in terms of innovations, and Bitcoin might die if consumers start adopting these altcoins. I think both of these issues are over-blown. Regarding issue 1, some people view stagnation as a disaster, especially for those who want Bitcoin to be a payment network (as opposed to Bitcoin as a store of value). I believe that Bitcoin can serve both use cases. But it will take a long time. Going back to Garziks point about the similarity between Bitcoin consensus and the US Constitution. We should think of the resistance to change as a feature, not a bug. Yes it might be slower to change things, but it also promotes stability for the ecosystem. Bitcoin needs patience and stability to succeed, it will not be overnight. Equally noteworthy is Garziks second point: Bitcoin should learn from NASAs TRL process and try to have the same maturity, in terms of gauging technology readiness and deploying them. Regarding issue 2, I think people vastly underestimate social acceptance, trust and network effects. It is not easy to create a brand as strong as Bitcoin. If you spend a lot of time in the cryptocurrency space, you might be inclined to think that any of the altcoins out there could replace Bitcoin tomorrow. But I dont think that will be the case. The Bitcoin brand is super strong and it has taken many years to get to this point. To quote the Isareli historian Yuval Noah Harari, money is essentially societys [collective hallucination](URL It wont be that easy to get everyone on the planet to hallucinate about an altcoin the same way we already do about Bitcoin. On the other hand, I think that **mining centralization is a much, much bigger issue. Unlike developers, miners have financial resources to throw around and can be more effective in bending the system to their benefits**. There have been a lot of examples throughout history of systems being corrupted by people with money. A few recent examples: the NRA lobbying against gun laws, or the oil industry lobbying against climate change policies. So for me, it is in Bitcoins interest to keep mining as decentralized as possible."

I, personally feel that the disclosure of the bug from someone like Peter Todd is more likely to be a political act over disclosing a bug. If it was at least reported through proper channels, I'd rather have seen a Github issue created with Peter Todd linking to it. _Returning to my editorial_ Peter Todd, a contributor to Bitcoin Core has recklessly disclosed a bug that knocked 75% of Bitcoin Unlimited nodes. Bitcoin Core has a very apparent way to disclose a critical bug like this, as shown below, however Peter Todd used this finding for political motivation. Now, I understand that Bitcoin Unlimited doesn't have a webpage with key developers and PGP keys, however if the tables were turned and a Bitcoin Unlimited developer released a bug for Bitcoin Core taking down 75% of the nodes, there would be chaos in the Bitcoin community, likely with [involvement with cyber-crime agencies](URL around the world. But since this was a client that ""violates consensus rules"", all is fine. To sum it up, a Bitcoin contributor and a fairly large name in the Bitcoin community has, in my mind, irresponsibly released a [bug on Twitter](URL all for political gain.

Now I don't care if you support Core or Unlimited, but please, responsibly disclose bugs like this through private channels. I guarantee taking five minutes out of your day and tracking down a dev on IRC is worth it, we all believe in Bitcoin, so why don't we act like it? _Post Rant Addendum_ Also, I do notice [this comment](URL so there was the chance that this was the bug simply to catch media attention. I don't know what to believe, as I am neither a developer for Core nor Unlimited. Maybe we need more people to scour the code of all clients and ensure they are safe on the network.

No one is expecting a &gt; 1mb block to be mined if/when BU hash reaches 50+%. One would expect that as hash rates increases so would the backing for the BU team. Indeed, if some bigger miners are lining up behind BU then it may well be wise for them to invest in helping to strengthen the BU team - as it is clear they have no constructive support from core at this stage - quite the opposite. There is going to be a period of consolidation and stability to ensure that BU has matured before miners start signalling for &gt; 1mb blocks - that is prudent. However, at this stage (when approaching 50%) it should be evident that the network is going to move - all those who want to *constructively* support bitcoin would be best focusing their efforts on strengthening BU rather than sabotaging their dev efforts in any way possible. Already BU is gaining production hardening experience, this is only to be expected - there is a steep curve to climb here and while it is being climbed others are standing around throwing rocks. Others will see the need to help out and add their skill sets. By the time of any hard fork there will be a lot of experience gained and hopefully a more highly resourced team. The damage to bitcoin via high fees and unpredictable confirmations is immeasurable and getting worse by the hour - splitting from core and going in a different direction does involve risk - but these risks are not insurmountable, we know that with enough dev resource and the right leadership it can be overcome, but the risks of maintaining a dysfunctional payment network is far greater - a risk that if not addressed may never be overcome."

118,vulnerability,btc,Why Bitcoin Unlimited approach is correct from a Software Architecture point of view,75,5zsqdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5zsqdm/why_bitcoin_unlimited_approach_is_correct_from_a/,2017-03-17 06:31:47,"First, I would like to express that the division in the community and the toxicity created by censorship has effected the discussion in both subs ( even though this sub is not censored ). As a community, we have been focused so much on fighting each other we struggle we are beginning to loose our creativity and the spark that made bitcoin great. I see more discussion of politics and name calling and its is beginning to get distracting. When a heated discussion in software engineering occurs, the best thing both sides can to is to abstract and conceptualize the system we are trying to work on. I consider bitcoin a decentralized system, where the blockchain represents the state of the system. Miners via POW allow the system to converge to a single valid state. What goes in the blockchain and the definition of a valid state is defined by the client, which implements a protocol that is 'bitcoin'. Ideally, this protocol definition should only specify 'business logic' for example there can be 21 million coins, you cannot materialise money out of thin air, the controlled issuing of coins, you cannot spend coins you don't have, no IOU ect. However, Satoshi realized that there is an attack vector that effects the consensus system, whereby a miner could artificially create over-sized blocks and give that miner a controllable benefit. The solution to this problem was to introduce a blocksize limit. This is the root problem the blocksize limit is trying to address. The blocksize was not made small so people can run full nodes via TOR or in raspberry pi's The problem with this fix, is that it introduced technical debt from a software architectural point of view. Because a blocksize limit is not 'business logic' and it had to be included in the consensus layer to resolve this vulnerability. Ideally the consensus layer should be minimal and should contain business logic and **not scalability constants...** The system can scale and evolve more easily overtime if the consensus layers has the minimal set of rules ( which we can all agree on).**My challenge to both the small and large blockers, is to try and find creative solutions to address the root cause of the blocksize limit.** Why dont we make it costly to artificially create large blocks. The easiest way a miner can increase a blocks size, is by creating thousands of transactions that have no fee and including them...**So what if:** *Each block can only contain X ""free transactions"", and other transactions in the block must have a fee. Perhaps eve define a function that scales the minimum fee for the other transactions as a function of the block reward. This would make it really expensive for miners to artificially bloat the block. [ Edit ] The only way to defeat this mechanism would be to then pad the block with artificial high fee transactions and withhold these transactions from the network so the miner gets back the fee. The only way to counter this attack is to have some mechanism so a block with high fee 'padding transactions' gets orphaned and the transactions re-entered into the mempool.* **tldr Goal: Remove any scaling logic from the consensus layer of bitcoin, which should only contain specification of business logic and block syntax. Hard scaling constants such as max blocksize should not be apart of the consensus logic because their value is subjective and is bad for decentralized systems.** edited to make OP more clear"
119,vulnerability,btc,WARNING: Core vulnerability is accepting invalid blocks!,0,6044ey,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6044ey/warning_core_vulnerability_is_accepting_invalid/,2017-03-19 00:39:51,"No, not really. But that seems to be implied by Blockstream's new position with the exchanges, no? Bitcoin Unlimited is already mining 33% or more of blocks. These blocks are accepted by nodes, and they're not being forked off the chain. But now the exchanges have decided that bitcoin unlimited is not the real bitcoin, not yet anyway. So if I try to to accept that and apply logic from there, then it seems the network is improperly validating fake BTC blocks that improperly signal for a blocksize increase. And if you believe that Core is the only valid trustworthy implementation, than that still makes sense, right? But then why haven't the exchanges implemented their new BTU symbol already? If a transaction was mined in a BU block, then it stands to reason the output is BTU only, and the true BTCs have not moved. Also, any coinbase from BU blocks, and all transactions from it, should be BTU. But then what happens if a Core block mines on top of a BU block? Core doesn't seem to be distinguishing between BTC and BTU! Core is improperly processing BTUs as if they were BTCs. We have hundreds of improperly validated blocks on the chain! Why is there no alarm about this? Are we going to see a massive rollback to pre-BU days? Have the exchanges thought this through?"

It is SegWit with Bitcoin or SegWit without Bitcoin. What do you think is better? The question is independent of what you think about BU. We have SegWit ready right now, it improves bitcoin, why not do it? 2) SegWit is not only the extra 0.7 MB, but also a lot of other things. It is on-chain scaling solution without hard fork 3) I have seen many interviews/blogs written by people who are not supporting SegWit. Some of them site the reason, yes, Roger Ver (/u/memorydealers ) included, that they will not support SegWit because the core did not listen enough to the business side of Bitcoins. This maybe true, but is no reason to stop bitcoin from growing. This is like saying we don't accept relativity because some Einstein's bad quality. We have to look at the papers he wrote and judge them critically. Similarly, we just have to look at the SegWit code here and judge it objectively. Does the code have some vulnerability? Does it achieve the purpose which it was claimed to achieve? It is irrelevant who wrote the code. It is also irrelevant that whether the code written by someone who is close to a moderator of a highly censored subreddit. If this is the reason that you (Miners) are blocking SegWit, I think you are destroying bitcoin because of personal reasons. I request the users of this subreddit to discuss this through rationally and objectively. "

In a rainbow attack, the attacker generates a large table of passwords and corresponding ciphertext. This allows them to look at the ciphertext and quickly know the password that was used to encrypt it. Multibit is vulnerable to this attack because the first few bytes of the wallet file tend to be the same across wallets and a fix initialization value is used in the file encryption process. Fortunately, there is a simple solution: A random initialization value. Every time a file is encrypted, a random initialization value is generated and these random bytes are prepended to the encrypted bytes. Multibit users dont have to do anything to take advantage of this security improvement. The system will detect when a file is encrypted with a fixed initialization value and automatically re-encypt the file with a random initialization value.

Industry has woken up and they now clearly see the value proposition of blockchains. Today, every single one of them is dismissing using the bitcoin network because of it's low capacity and high fees. Let me assure you, that is a very good thing for us. If we had 300mb blocks supporting transactions for a penny a piece, I guarantee you that businesses would fill every bit of that space as fast as possible; to record their stock trades, their invoices, their medical records, you name it. That's all I heard talked about by various banks and industries. They are incredibly excited about the prospect of using blockchains for these purposes. Today, they are choosing to use ethereum and hyperledger and others, since the bitcoin network cannot support that use case. Let's be clear. We do **not** want them using our network to record billions of their petty transactions. The bitcoin network needs to be protected. It has, today, 12 billion dollars worth of value in it. In coming years we all hope to see that approach 120 billion and even higher. The acceptable level of risk, when it comes to changing the network dynamics, is extraordinarily low. Could we raise the blocksize limit to 2mb safely? Yeah, probably we could. Could we raise it to maybe 4mb or even 8mb? Maybe, with extensive testing and some network improvements. But, even if we did that, that space would get flooded immediately. There is exponential demand for cheap, insanely secure, transaction space that bitcoin would offer. What I learned at that conference is everyone wants what bitcoin has, and if they can get it cheaply they will use it all up. Look, I get it. The high fees are annoying. The inability to perform low value transactions in a timely manner is annoying. But, let me tell you what is frightening. The idea that we would make rapid changes to the network, risking decentralization or network problems, risking everyone's money, just so we can keep using the network for inexpensive low value payments. Did everyone else see their bitcoins increase in value dramatically in the past few weeks? Good. Keep it that way. The acceptable level of risk to our savings is pretty low. When I began my career as a software engineer I started out doing cardiovascular research at St. Louis University. I worked on software which analyzed every single heartbeat a patient had for 24 hours. If my software had a bug in it, it could actually lead to the death of a patient. Now imagine someone who writes software for a pacemaker, an airliner, a nuclear power station, and so on. I didn't do that work for long, for most of my career I have worked on computer video games where, the worst that could happen, is someone's game might crash and they lose some save-game checkpoint. A bug easily patched. But..a bug in bitcoin, or a network vulnerability, could lead to a loss of 12 billion dollars worth of value! We have spent since 2009 building up trust in this network to the point that people are willing to commit 12 billion dollars of value in it. The acceptable level of risk to any change to the network or the software is incredibly low. We can, and should, get sidechains up and working as soon as possible. On a sidechain, pegged to bitcoin value, you could try BU, you could try any damned crazy ideal you want. And, the only thing at risk is whatever value got pegged over there. "

Its not just that the blockchain is being spammed and raising transaction fees it's much complex than that. Much like the stress test that occurred in July when the blockchain became clogged and we saw a meteoric rise in LTC. Attackers used funds from the rising price of LTC to sustain the attack. I believe this attack has show a vulnerability in Bitcoin. This vulnerability stems from the fact that we have an artificial cap on transactions and Bitcoin HODLers are an exploitable resource as they have been trained never to sell and are being taken for granted by devs and miners. Dev's have told us to deal with the rising fees because we developing a fee market. Miners will not be motivated to increase capacity because as they will be making much more revenue in fees. So in Bitcoin's current state this attack vector is very effective. However, unlike July the situation we are currently in is much more dire. LTC has never really been a true competitor to Bitcoin, but Ethereum is. This will cause more fear and uncertainty for users to jump ship to Ethereum and buy into the bubble. Ethereum has already seen a big rise in value before blocks were getting full so that is lending credence that this is not a pump and dump. Ethereum's technology is solid and has a great dev crew. Ethereum is actually great for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What is not great is this blatant manipulation by certain forces to extract value from Bitcoin HODLers by adding stress to already near full system. I say all this even though it could be a detriment to me as I hold a large position in ETH. The attack is much easier to accomplish this time around now that blocks are close to full. The chances are good that this could be a very long sustained attacked and along with the natural growth of Bitcoin, it will eventually cause a fee event. It's possible we will see a slow decline in value of BTC and ever rising transactions fees. This will culminate in a huge drop in the price of BTC and a bubble in ETH. If this occurs a panic will ensue, fees will skyrocket as people rush for an exit. You are going to doubt yourself and think ETH might be the one, that this is the great migration. Just remember ETH needs Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the funnel to the outside fiat world. As a HODLer if this scenario plays out, hold to your convictions. Do not sell and HODL as always. I just thought I'd share might my thoughts so as many can be prepared if such an event occurs. It much easier to deal with these situations if you are mentally prepared for them. "

Around the same time LTC had meteoric rise from 2 to 8.65. On July 8th this was the top post on /r/bitcoin: URL The next day, LTC hit the high of 8.65 and within a week the price dumped to 3. There is no direct evidence that this attack was orchestrated to pump and dump litecoin, however, it did show a possible vulnerability to attack Bitcoin's user base. This attack is a direct reward response for spamming the blockchain as it can frustrate Bitcoin users to make them move to altcoins. The rising of the value of the altcoins gives fuel to spammers to sustain the attack. If I was coordinating the attack I would do it something like this: * Accumulate a large position in an altcoin over time without trying to move price too much. * Start the spam attack and acquire more of the altcoin pumping the price so that it might garner some attention * Create more negative propaganda against bitcoin about transactions, dev's, the technology etc. * Sell enough of the pumped altcoin to sustain the attack if funds were low * Make one final spam push to really frustrate users then dump the altcoin after it bubbles. Unlike July, Bitcoin is much more vulnerable to this type of attack. The user base is much more frustrated, fearful, and anxious as we near the block size limit. The attack is much cheaper sustain also now that blocks are closer to being full. I am not saying this the case with the certain altcoin that has seen very large gains recently, but it could be a possibility. I do fear these types of attacks will get easier as blocks get more full. If I was the attacker I would try to cause a fee event in Bitcoin where tx fees were pushed to bubble like levels. This could possibly be done nudging the lower limit of transaction fee's that are guaranteed to be in a block higher and higher until it snowballs and causes a panic. If this occurred frustration levels would skyrocket, users would be envious of the altcoin's rise, and a large portion of Bitcoin's user base would be captured and dumped on. Unfortunately, I do not see a way to prevent this attack other than making the community aware of it and just remember to stick to your convictions and HODL."

So basically, Bitcoin software (Core, Classic, etc.) is unable to push through changes directed at mining centralization, because those changes would never be accepted by miners, who are interested in short-to-mid-term ROI. Therefore, the Bitcoin ecosystem is unable to fix mining centralization. Bitcoin has painted itself into a corner, and the problem can only be solved by a separate system that doesn't have this vulnerability to begin with. Another possible scenario is that Bitcoin could get government acceptance within China. The Chinese wouldn't have the same aversion to ""Chinese centralization"", and it's a big enough market to support its own cryptocurrency.

134,vulnerability,btc,Why soft fork is a very bad idea and should be avoided at all costs,7,42w69q,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/42w69q/why_soft_fork_is_a_very_bad_idea_and_should_be/,2016-01-27 17:22:17,"I was surprised by the latest announcement of Pieter that a SegWit implementation which changes pretty much everything in bitcoin can be implemented via a soft fork, where it does not require all the nodes to upgrade to be compatible After a bit research, this is possible because you can always give old data new meaning in a new implementation, while the old nodes simply do not know how to parse that data As a result, a new block will be accepted by the old nodes because they appear to be valid. But in the new implementation, they are just a small subset of the new data structure, all the transaction data is in another related block After further analysis, it shows that although normal nodes can still run old client, all the mining nodes will have to upgrade, otherwise the blocks mined by them will simply be orphaned, because the new nodes do not accept old blocks, and new nodes have majority of hash power As a result, such a soft fork will force 100% of the mining nodes move to the new implementation so that there is no slightest chance of the old mining nodes forking into their own chain: They don't even know they are already on a new chain, they just discovered that their mined blocks all become orphaned What this means in practical? If one type of nodes, SW for example, controls over 51% of hash power, they can implement whatever change they like by simply use this soft fork trick: Let all the old Core nodes accept their new format blocks while SW nodes will reject Core blocks, so that Core blocks all get orphaned due to less hash power The most deadly part is that SW nodes do not need to ask for permission of Core nodes, they simply enforce it by orphaning blocks mined by those Core nodes. And Core nodes have no way to fork into another chain by rejecting SW blocks, since they can not tell which block is Core block and which block is SW block, in their view it is all core blocks As a result, a miner running core will simply lose money, he either trash his miners and quit the game, or bite the bullet and upgrade to SW so that his hash power can still mine him some coins. I guess majority of the miners will upgrade. And they might start another round of similar soft fork to regain control when they accumulated more than 51% of hash power This is very bad, since it totally removed the freedom of choice for those old mining nodes, you can call it a forceful take over of bitcoin network by 51% hash power. It totally break the major consensus rule and the spirit of bitcoin, so that with only 51% of hash power, you can implement whatever you want and force it upon rest of the miners and their hash power will be enslaved by your soft fork Sure, Core nodes can change to another PoW fork, but since the value of the coin is always roughly the same as the mining cost due to arbitraging, that coin will not get more value than litecoin and will be forgotten quickly Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to prevent such thing from happening by current design, so it is very important in mining community to widely spread this information so that miners are fully aware of the deadly effect of a soft fork, and reject such attempt as much as possible.

135,vulnerability,btc,What Core should have said (for Adam Back and others),1,437iuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/437iuf/what_core_should_have_said_for_adam_back_and/,2016-01-29 16:50:56,"If Core had made the following statement shortly after BIP 101 was published, the turmoil facing the Bitcoin community over the block size limit could have been avoided, IMHO: &gt;Dear Bitcoin Community &gt;When Satoshi announced Bitcoin in late 2008, he declared that even with the technology available at the time, the network would be capable of scaling up the size of its blocks to handle Visa's average throughput of 3,000 to 4,000 transactions per second, and that this would be done through fully validating nodes consolidating into a fewer number run by professionals with server-farms. &gt;In the two years that followed, he made several statements reaffirming that Bitcoin could handle thousands of transactions per second on the blockchain, and that the evolution into a network where only a small percentage of users are capable and willing to run a fully validating node was an acceptable means by which this could occur. &gt;Based on these statements by Satoshi, the commonly held belief among those who adopted Bitcoin, and created businesses around it, was that if traffic increased and blocks grew to 1 MB, the 1 MB limit would be raised. Evidence for this includes the text that appeared for several years on Bitcoin's unofficial Wiki page on scaling, which reiterated that Bitcoin nodes could in fact handle thousands of transactions per second if the transaction demand presented itself. &gt;We as the Core development community acknowledge that the scaling of on-chain capacity to thousands of transactions per second, at the expense of the distribution of fully validating nodes, is in fact the original vision declared for Bitcoin. We further acknowledge that a core principle of Bitcoin is that its qualities will not be changed without consensus. We believe that this principle extends to the scaling roadmap originally set in place and accepted by the community. &gt;For all of these reasons, we have agreed to implement BIP 101 by the third quarter of 2016, by which time it is projected that the average block size will begin to come up against the current block size limit. &gt;However, at this juncture, we feel it is our responsibility to appeal to the Bitcoin community to support a change in Bitcoin's vision, as we believe there is a better and more responsible way forward, that better fulfills the aspirations of the majority of the userbase to bring about a decentralized and globally accessible digital currency. &gt;This proposal for a change in Bitcoin's vision is informed by the opinions of the vast majority of the reference client development community. We believe that in accordance with the principle of consensus-driven change, an alternate plan from that set in place by Satoshi in the first couple of years of Bitcoin's existence should only be pursued if consensus emerges in the community for such a change, and we want to try to create this consensus. &gt;We are appealing to the Bitcoin community at large to consider the following: 1. The emergence of pooled mining was not anticipated by Satoshi. This has massively increased mining centralization, and created a choke point at which Bitcoin's censorship resistance - an essential quality of the network - can be threatened. Any further increases in full node operating costs will only exacerbate this critical vulnerability. 2. We now have more than one potential avenue to fulfill the need for large-scale trustless transaction capacity, that do not require placing millions of transactions on the blockchain and sacrificing the current level of decentralization of fully validating nodes. The most prominent and promising of these options is the Lightning Network, which can provide practically unlimited access to trustless transactions at much more modest costs to full node decentralization. These alternate scaling options did not exist during Satoshi's time, and it is of the opinion of the majority of Core developers that it would be better to pursue these options and carefully raise the limit when bandwidth improvements and optimizations allow, than to raise the block size limit at an exponential rate as BIP 101 proposes, and threaten Bitcoin's core property of decentralization. 3. Many Core developers, including some of its most knowledgeable and experienced, will be forced to abandon Bitcoin if it loses the qualities that made it interesting in the first place, namely decentralization and censorship resistance, and believe BIP 101 could lead to this outcome. These developers are not giving an ultimatum or otherwise issuing a threat as a pressure tactic against the community, but they do feel the public deserves to know where they stand on the issue of BIP 101, decentralization and their future willingness to be involved if the current course is maintained, so that the Bitcoin community has all of the relevant facts when deciding whether the original scaling roadmap is the prudent course of action. &gt;Over the course of the next several weeks, we will publish a series of posts on the Bitcoin.org blog, to explain why the majority of Core developers believe in pursuing a prudent alternate scaling plan. We will also organize a Vote by Stake, to allow holders of the bitcoin currency to express their preference on the matter. We are planning to hold this vote over a course of three weeks this year, from November 1 to November 21. We believe that if over 80 percent of the Stakeholders vote for this new plan, then we have achieved a broad enough consensus to pursue this new vision for Bitcoin that is described in this document. &gt;Signed, "
136,vulnerability,btc,Proposal: Make miners prove that they validated (or at a minimum know the full contents of) the block 4 blocks ago,2,44rahx,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/44rahx/proposal_make_miners_prove_that_they_validated_or/,2016-02-09 02:10:34,"The topic of how SPV mining is bad has come up several times in the last year. There was a [recent proposal](URL to demand that miners prove that they have received all of the contents of a block before they can start mining. There have been various proposals in the same spirit over the years. I think making miners prove they have the full contents of the block they are trying to build on is a bad idea, because it puts miners at a disadvantage if they cannot rapidly acquire the entire block contents. This task favors centralized players with high bandwidth, low latency connectivity, which is expensive, and the problem gets worse the larger blocks get. Players with poor connectivity will fail to mine profitably because too much of their time will be spent receiving and validating each block. A similar benefit could be achieved without the negative centralization impact if the miners are asked to provide evidence that they validated a block far enough in the past. For example, if miners were required to provide evidence that they validated a block at height H - 4 when mining the block at height H, then you have a situation where there is a 99.9% chance that the block at H-4 will have been broadcast more than 250 seconds ago. On average, miners would have 30 minutes to receive and validate the H - 4 block. I do not know exactly what kind of evidence the miners should be asked to provide. It would be nice if the evidence had the following properties: 1. Showed that they actually validated the block, not just that they knew it. Alternatively, it could maybe just take a similar amount of time as validation takes, so that there is no temporal cost to validating in parallel. 2. Verifying the evidence would not add much time to the overall block validation step. 3. Verifying the evidence would not be necessary to perform the rest of the block validation. Like with segwit, nodes could skip this verification if they wanted to. 4. Was hard to outsource. For example, perhaps the proof could incorporate the header from block H-1, or some of the intermediate mining steps that would only be accessible to someone who was about to solve the block. The above idea could be implemented with a soft fork, and would create incentives that would practically guarantee that miners would would validate every block as soon as possible. It would not absolutely enforce that behavior, so theoretically miners could construct a chain 3 blocks long on top of an invalid block before they were forced to prove knowledge of the bad block. I think this would be incredibly unlikely if the above idea were implemented because the cost to behave ""properly"" would be negligible, and if you misbehave you risk losing a lot of money. But what if such a chain were produced? First of all, unless the network is deploying a soft fork, fully validating nodes would not accept the bad block and would not notice the bad chain. As I understand it, the fact that SPV nodes do not validate blocks could cause them to follow this bad chain, however this vulnerability could be improved with a simple fix. When validating nodes serve blocks to SPV nodes, they would include a message to indicate that they have personally validated the block. SPV nodes could be configured to consider a block ""provisional"" until several nodes indicate that they have validated the block. *** My first reaction to this issue was that SPV mining did not present a big problem because miners are incentivized to validate as soon as possible, and discard blocks or chains when they discovered they were invalid. I have changed my mind this weekend and suggest making the changes described above. What I realized, is that while SPV mining is pretty harmless during normal operation, it can be disastrous during a soft fork. Consider this scenario: 1. A soft fork is being rolled out, and whatever threshold of miners has been reached. Blocks that do not conform to the soft fork are officially considered invalid. 2. An un-upgraded miner produces a block that is valid according to the old rules, but invalid according to the new rules. 3. Even though they indicated that they were ready for the soft fork, a large fraction of the miners are just SPV mining, not actually validating. They do not notice that this block does not obey the rules of the soft fork and they build on it. Call this chain B for bad. 4. Un-upgraded nodes cannot notice that these blocks are ""bad."" They see these blocks as confirming transactions. 5. Miners who have upgraded, and are validating, reject the longest chain and continue working on the soft fork. Call this chain G for good. 6. Upgraded nodes follow chain G. 7. The network therefore experiences an unplanned hard fork between chain B and chain G. Eventually all miners will switch to one of the two chains, but it cannot be known ahead of time which chain will win. This is pretty much a worst case scenario. From the above, part of the personality of a soft-fork becomes more clear to me. During a soft fork, it is impossible for fully validating nodes, if they are not upgraded, to determine whether or not they are on the correct chain. This puts almost all of the power and responsibility on the miners. If they mine without validating during this delicate phase, no one else is positioned well to correct their mistakes. Un-upgraded nodes are effectively turned into SPV clients -- not just for transactions making use of newly rolled out features, but for the question of which chain is valid. Ideally, miners would: 1. Receive the solved header for B(N-1) 2. Start mining B(N) with no transactions 3. Receive a compact (e.g. bloom filter) message that allows them to include at least some transactions while mining B(N). 4. Receive the main block B(N-1) absent the SW and do a complete (provisional) update of the UTXO state. Prioritize transactions and start mining a full block. 5. Receive the segregated witness for B(N-1) and fully validate the block. 6. Discard the current block and roll back the utxo state if you have discovered that B(N-1) is invalid. Forcing miners to validate prior to hashing could cause most miners to **stop validating at all** and outsource the validation job to specialists with low latency internet connections, much like how high frequency trading is done on computers that are physically located close together. This is not a good idea."

A lot of people have been working on the problem of creating digital cash for a long time. All parts of the problem were solved a long time ago, except for one: how to ensure that currency units can only be spent once. This problem is itself a subset of the problem of how to make digital cash monetarily usefully by controlling the supply. Every solution prior to Bitcoin either involved a trusted third party, infinite inflation. Trusted third parties can fail or be subverted and infinite inflation destroys the monetary properties that would make anyone want to use digital cash. There are decentralized Byzantine consensus algorithms that pre-date Bitcoin, but all of them have the property that the participants in the algorithm is defined. A decentralized trusted third party is still a trusted third party. #What does proof of work do? Proof of work accomplishes two things: * It allows consensus to emerge from an non-defined set of participants. There is no list of miners who are allowed to create blocks. Miners can come and go at will without disrupting the system. Established miners can not prevent new miners from competing with them. * It creates a non-avoidable cost for double spending. To see how the second point works, see this diagram: URL In order to double spend in Bitcoin, a miner must create (at least) two versions of the block at a particular height. Because blocks are only accepted if they contain valid proof of work, there is no way for a miner avoid paying the energy cost of making the extra block. In a time period where a miner could have made n blocks, if they choose to double spend they only get to claim the revenue of (n-1) blocks, therefore they will lose money if the benefit of the double spend is less than the revenue they forfeit. That behaviour is what Bitcoin can promise with regards to double spending resistance - no more and no less. This resistance to double spending is **not dependent on the number of miners**. Even if there was just one miner, that miner would still lose money by double spending transactions that were worth less the revenue they forfeit by extending the chain by one less block than they otherwise could have. Right about here is where the academic cryptographers throw up their hands and declare Bitcoin to be ""broken"" because it only provides linear security guarantees instead of super-linear guarantees. This is a result of them applying inappropriate threat models to the problem. You need super-linear security properties to make sure that an individual can securely encrypt their emails. Commerce, however, does not require this degree of certainty. Entrepreneurs and businessmen are constantly managing risk, and the economy works in spite of all risks not being reduced to zero. In terms of double spending risk, it's enough for Bitcoin to say, ""I can tell you under what conditions someone would lost money by reversing their payment"". As long as risk is predictable it can be accurately priced, and as long as accurate pricing is possible an economy can form. #Even if an economy can work even with relatively modest double spend protection, shouldn't we try for more? Yes, but only if the attempt to achieve better doesn't break something else. A goal of ""decentralization at all costs"" will produce more double spending resistance than the economy needs, and usually at a cost of restricting the transaction rate, a.k.a the reason that a currency exists in the first place. #What about censorship resistance? Miners lose money by not including profitable transactions in blocks, just like they lose money by double spending, so fundamentally Bitcoin has the same resistance to censorship (a block inclusion DoS attack) as it does to double spending. Users can reduce their risk of being subject to a block inclusion DoS attack by engaging in proper privacy hygiene such that the attacker doesn't know which transactions belong to the entities they want to attack. #What if the miners really go off the rails? Miners are service providers who sell a product to their customers. Right now, their customers almost exclusively consist of new Bitcoin investors. Miners are only profitable if their customers continue to purchase their product, and so if the miners stop producing the the product the investors want to buy, those investors can fire the miners. Firing miners in a system such as Bitcoin is tricky. It's not possible to fire an individual miner - only all of them at the same time. The most obvious way to do this is for all the investors and users to agree to honour a different proof of work function at a specified block height, where ""all"" means ""a sufficient fraction of the economy such that even those who disagree go along with it to avoid taking an even greater loss."" Once this was done, the existing mining industry would collapse due to a lack of customers and a new one would replace it. #Isn't it dangerous for investors to have this much power? Yes, it is. Right now, almost a dangerous fraction of the liquidity between Bitcoin and non-Bitcoin commodities must pass through the choke points of regulated money service businesses. This is a major vulnerability. The way out of this situation is to grow the native Bitcoin economy as quickly as possible so that liquidity is provided less through exchanges and more through direct trade in products and services. It is much more difficult to enforce a law that prevents millions of people from accepting Bitcoin as a method of payment than it is to shut down a dozen or so bank accounts. That is accomplished by having more transactions directly on the block chain generating the revenue that pays miners. The best way to secure Bitcoin from attack is to build a closed-loop economy that needs hundreds of transactions per second, then thousands, then millions."

141,vulnerability,btc,"A lot of Peter Todd's ""work"" involves exposing and exploiting some subtle vulnerability in an existing system. Often the best response is to simply PATCH THE VULNERABILITY - and not to officially consecrate / bless his exploit by incorporating it into your ""Core Reference Client"".",18,3usd2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3usd2h/a_lot_of_peter_todds_work_involves_exposing_and/,2015-11-30 12:12:17,"TL;DR: (1) Peter Todd believes in securing systems exclusively through code, and not through any social or political or economic norms or pressures or incentives (see the cex.io mining hashpower incident, where he erroneously believed the sky was falling and said he was dumping half his Bitcoins to buy Viacoins - although social pressure ended up resolving the cex.io threat). If your system has a vulnerability at the code level (which might actually be adequately secured at the social or political or economic level), he considers your code to be ""fair game"" for him to exploit. (2) In the case of RBF, Peter may have finally gone too far: instead of exposing and exploiting an EXISTING subtle vulnerability in our SOFTWARE system, he exposed and exploited an existing subtle vulnerability in our GOVERNANCE system (based on ACKs from ""Core"" / Bitstream devs on a mailing list + his commit access to the ""Core"" / Blockstream Github repo) to INTRODUCE a NEW subtle vulnerability into our SOFTWARE system - perhaps because he doesn't feel himself to be constrained by the above-mentioned social or political or economic norms or pressures or incentives. An easy solution, of course, is to simply **DUMP CORE** and vote with your feet and install a Bitcoin implementation with more open / transparent / responsive governance, such as Hearn's (and Gavin's?) XT. --- (1) The mere fact that **your** ""patch"" might not be mathematically pure and perfect enough to satisfy **his** criteria (ie, just because your patch might rely not solely on **code** but might also need to rely on certain **social** or **political** or **economic** norms or pressures or incentives, **outside** the code itself), **in an ideal world this should not give Peter Todd the right to vandalize your working social / political / economic system of patches** simply because he might not happen to share or feel constrained or motivated by the social or political or economic norms or pressures or incentives of your community. By the way, to see an example of Peter Todd's tendency to under-estimate the effectiveness of social or political or economic norms or pressures or incentives, we can look back to the time of the cex.io mining hashpower drama a few years back. In that situation, Peter rather dramatically announced that he was selling half his Bitcoin hodlings to move into Viacoin. As it turned out, social or political or economic norms or pressures or incentives imposed by the community *did* end up being effective, and the mining hashrate percentage of cex.io dramatically dropped, definitively. (2) But wait, it gets even worse that that: We already know (from several years of observation) that Peter Todd likes to show his prowess at ""breaking"" existing software systems. In the case of RBF, in his enthusiasm for breaking things, he may have gone a little bit too far. In the case of RBF, he didn't simply expose and exploit a vulnerability in our existing SOFTWARE system. Instead, he exposed and exploited a subtle bug or vulnerability or a hole in our existing GOVERNANCE system - to INTRODUCE a NEW subtle vulnerability in our existing SOFTWARE system. Now you may be wondering, what exactly do I mean by ""a subtle vulnerability in our existing GOVERNANCE system""? Simply this: he (ab)used ... - his commit access on the ""Core"" / Blockstream Github repo, plus - his inclusion in the informal ACK/NACK voting process on whatever mailing list where these ""Core"" / Blockstream developers continue to get together online to engage in informal discussion and decision-making) ... in order to INTRODUCE a NEW subtle vulnerability into our SOFTWARE system - he added a vulnerability which wasn't actually present yet. **But many say: ""That bug was already there.""** Now, many of the Core / ""Blockstream"" devs and RBF apologists have been claiming that this subtle vulnerability ""was already there"" IN OUR SOFTWARE SOFTWARE - but, when examined more closely, they only mean that it ""could someday have been added there"" by anybody who was unscrupulous enough TO ABUSE OUR EXISTING GOVERNANCE SYSTEM. In reality, no coder ever actually *did* such a thing. Until now, when Peter Todd did. And, to add insult to injury, he rather rudely and insensitively tweeted **on Black Friday** that he merged RBF to the ""Core"" Github repo - a modification which had the side-effect of basically destroying most of the existing risk-management systems which many retail businesses already had in place and which so far have been ""good enough"" to work in practice By the way, some of these risk management systems supporting zero-conf for retail may also relied to some degree on certain social or political or economic norms or pressures or incentives - which in turn may have possibly relied upon certain special factors exclusively characterizing face-to-face retail transactions - which kinda makes sense if you think about it: zero-conf supported by pragmatic risk management was evolving important use cases in the specific environment of retail, leveraging certain social or political or economic norms or pressures or incentives which would only be available face-to-face. So this vulnerability was not ACTUALLY present in our software system - it was only POTENTIALLY present - waiting for some dev who was bold / arrogant / reckless enough to disregard our **social** or **political** or **economic** norms or pressures or incentives and exploit an existing subtle vulnerability in our GOVERNANCE system (mailing list ACKs from ""Core"" / Blockstream devs + Github repo commit access) to inject this NEW subtle vulnerability into our SOFTWARE system. Until Peter Todd tweeted on Black Friday that he had killed existing zero-conf risk-management systems for retail by merging RBF into ""Core"", nobody else entrusted with participation in the ""Core"" / Blockstream online mailing-list informal ACK/NACK voting process and Github repo commit access had been so bold / arrogant / reckless as to take it upon themselves to actually (ab)use this kind of existing vulnerability at our GOVERNANCE level to introduce a NEW vulnerability at our SOFTWARE level. --- The above might just be a long-winded way of arguing that : - it's time for us to say ""You're fired"" to Peter Todd; or (more realistically)... - it's time for us to say ""your code is deprecated"" to the ""Core"" / Blockstream devs on that mailing list who ACKed Peter Todd's RBF proposal on their mailing list, giving him the go-ahead to merge it into their Github repo. Fortunately it might not be that hard anymore to do the above two things. We can simply uninstall ""Core"" and install some other SOFTWARE system(s) whose GOVERNANCE system(s) are more open / transparent / responsive to user needs and requirements One example of such a system would be Bitcoin-XT, whose devs (Hearn and Gavin) have gone to great lengths to: - provide much more open / transparent / responsive governance mechanisms - really listen to what users are prioritizing as their most urgent needs and requirements For example, Gavin and Hearn have interacted a lot with the community on their blogs and videos, mainly on the two hottest topics that everyone's naturally most concerned about at this point in Bitcoin's life cycle: scaling and governance. Also, Gavin is involved with MIT and has done extensive testing of bigger block sizes on testnet, and Hearn developed the BitcoinJ client (needed to run Bitcoin clients on Android) and the Lighthouse project (a major innovation which could, for example, support crowd-funding of development). Meanwhile, Peter Todd has shown himself to be not terribly interested in the issues which the community cares about most (scaling and governance). Instead, he prefers to focus on weird little edge cases (such as RBF) which break important existing aspects of the system (such as zero-conf for retail), working with the ""Core"" / Blockstream devs who provided the ACKs to allow him to merge RBF into their Github repo with no debate and no testing and no consensus from the Bitcoin user community. **DUMP CORE** Bitcoin users can and should reject the closed / opaque / unresponsive ""Core"" / Blockstream / Peter Todd approach to governance, in favor of the open / transparent / responsive approach favored by Hearn and Gavin, and any other devs who may also come along or break away from ""Core"" / Blockstream. ---"

I was used to the idea that any address that hadn't been spent from was considered quantum-safe. But this isn't true for any coins that were mined and not moved prior to 2012. What this means is that all of Satoshi's coins are theoretically stealable by anyone who can pull off a successful quantum attack on bitcoin. In fact, we must now consider them the canary in bitcoin's quantum coalmine because they will likely be the first to fall. Anyone who can pull off a successful quantum attack on these early unmoved coins will make over **$500 million dollars**. Today. Everyone will think Satoshi is moving his coins, but in fact it will more likely be a quantum attacker, and that is a shame, unless Satoshi himself wizes up and acts soon. Beyond that, a successful quantum attack may allow someone to masquerade as Satoshi by giving them the private key to these original coins. The day is quickly approaching where even if someone were to sign a message using Satoshi's known coin hoard addresses, we should think twice about whether this person actually is Satoshi or not, since it may not be long before a successful quantum attack will make his early addresses vulnerable to exposure. Now this vulnerability changed in 2012, so current mining to an unspent address is, thankfully, safe. And if you have an address with coins in it that has never been spent from, you are also quantum safe. I just fear we are in for more Satoshi-hoaxing and drama due to these old addresses. And if Satoshi's coins ever move, we should consider it likely that the quantum nut has finally been cracked by someone and we'll need to be more careful about address reuse. There may be one other issue. There may be a lot of 2012 mined coined that has never been spent. Right now we consider much of this coin to be simply lost. But in the near future, quantum cryptographers may be able to recover much of this coin and make perhaps another $500 million or so. A billion dollar prize for the quantum researchers out there. Not a bad plum if you ask me."

144,vulnerability,btc,Is bitcoin susceptible to infiltration by government intelligence agencies who wish to destroy the project?,15,3ya6oc,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3ya6oc/is_bitcoin_susceptible_to_infiltration_by/,2015-12-27 00:00:05,"Personally I believe we are currently under a coordinated attack by government surveillance institutions who want to destroy Bitcoin. These intelligence organisations are certainly Straussian and an undeniable threat to Bitcoin, although the current level of infiltration is unknown. We know that infiltration is a widely used and successful tactic deployed by intelligence organisations. That's not conspiracy theory, its fact, they use it to manage &amp; monitor animal rights activists, leftists, environmental activists, unions, right wing groups, other national governments, alleged terrorist groups,/cells, agitators and political parties they don't like. Often infiltrators are deployed simply because of the ideas of the groups rather than the relative threat. This is all fact, anyone that would deny this is delusional, wilfully or otherwise. We believe that Bitcoin is a threat to nation states and the financial system, therefore you can fucking well believe that intelligence networks also see it as a possible threat, if only because of the rhetoric of Bitcoin proponents. On that basis I think it is naive to believe that there have not been attacks on the community through infiltration. These infiltrators will seek to control and obfuscate the narrative to destroy real debate and coordination. We have to prevent that. Finally, we know that intelligence organisations have always understood encryption. From the time of Turing, breaking encryption to undermine their enemies has been their raison d'etre. So these organisations will have many patriots who are experts in the cross-fields of encryption and software development on their books. Based upon that simple train of thought, it is impossible for us to rationally assume that the core dev community has not been infiltrated by intelligence agencies, although the extent of which is unknown, and so is the impact upon the development path. Infiltrators may be on both sides of a perceived debate, stoking the fires and creating animosity within the community, they may not be on one side particularly or the other. But we cannot assume there is any stratum of the community they do not act in. At the very least, we require multiple implementations in order to combat this attack vector. All of these implementations may be infiltrated, but all least we will have alternatives to migrate to when a manufactured vulnerability is discovered. But as a community, with the knowledge that this coordinated attack is more than likely underway, how do we trust each other. Somewhat counter intuitively, I think we need to trust everyone implicitly, because the way the infiltrators win is by showing discord, disunity, animosity. If we assume good faith, even to sometimes unreasonable levels, and stop calling each other liars of fools, then we can weed out the infiltrators by reducing their negative influence. A person should never be called an infiltrator unless there is undeniable evidence to prove it. Investigative journalists interested in these community &amp; bitcoin should seek to uncover these infiltrators without further stoking the fires. To do this everyone collectively must accept that they may be completely wrong, on all sides of the debate, no matter how technically proficient you are, and to work to discover the weak points in our own argumentation more than the weak points in the argumentation of your opponents'. That is the only way to win against those who wish to destroy bitcoin from the inside. To conclude, please read this: URL If you disagree, please help me to find the flaws in my logic, but don't assume I'm wrong just because it goes against your intuition and prior beliefs. We all need to be more humble, at every level, in order to restore the unity of this community."

This decision was made when considering the appeal of Richard Gratkowski, sentenced to 5 years and 10 months in prison. Earlier, the FBI found out that between June 2016 and May 2017, Richard Gratkovsky used Bitcoins to purchase prohibited pornographic materials involving minors. Having detected the wallets used by him, the agency turned to Coinbase with a request to disclose information about this client. The exchange complied with this requirement without a court order.  Binance Exchange has confirmed the launch of a cryptocurrency debit card in partnership with Swipe. Information about this appeared on the official website of the company but later disappeared. One of the features of the card will be the ability to exchange cryptocurrencies for fiat money in real-time. Users will be able to transfer money to the card directly from the Binance trading account. Payments will be instant, funds can be spent immediately after crediting. In addition, cardholders will be able to withdraw cash from ATMs.  The District of Columbia Bar has allowed lawyers in Washington D.C. to accept payments in Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. Representatives of the organization noted that cryptocurrencies are rapidly gaining popularity as a means of payment and lawyers cannot stand aside from these changes. Acceptance of payment in crypto is permissible if the lawyer is able to ensure the safe storage of assets. To do this, he must have basic knowledge in the field of blockchain. **Projects, Collaborations, Startups**  BlockFi, a company operating in the cryptocurrency lending market, reported a doubling of monthly revenue in the second quarter. The driver was halving and launching a mobile application. By now, monthly income has quadrupled since the end of last year and doubled if we start from the end of March, said Zac Prince, co-founder, and CEO of the startup.  CoinGecko, an analytical service, has announced a partnership with cybersecurity company Hacken. As part of the collaboration, CoinGecko integrated into the so-called Trust Score cryptocurrency exchange security assessment metrics based on the platform data from Hacken. Among others, Hacken considers platform infrastructure security, including server security, two-factor user authentication, spam and phishing protection, and other criteria.  According to Messari, the market capitalization of dollar-tied stablecoin Tether (USDT) reached $10.3 billion. The growth since the beginning of the year, when the figure was $4.76 billion, exceeded 116%. Other stablecoins are significantly inferior to USDT in terms of market supply.  Binance cryptocurrency exchange has completed a major update of the trading engine, increasing the processing speed of operations by 10 times, company CEO Changpeng Zhao said. According to him, the update was the largest in the history of Binance. It took two years to develop it. Zhao noted that in doing so, the exchange is preparing the next wave of cryptocurrency market growth. **Blockchain**  According to Messari, Bitcoin and Ethereum account for more than 99% of the commissions received by all miners. Over the past 24 hours, the total amount of commissions in the Bitcoin network has amounted to $407,571. Ethereum has a significantly higher rate  $814,082.  On June 30, at block # 637 056 in the Bitcoin network, the planned recalculation of mining complexity took place. The indicator has undergone the most insignificant change since March 22, 2010, having decreased by 0.0033% from 15.7847 T to 15.7842 T. Thus, the complexity of mining Bitcoin almost did not change for the first time in 10 years.  A transaction of 101 857 BTC (\~$ 933 million at the time of sending) was recorded in the Bitcoin network between anonymous addresses. Transaction passed between anonymous addresses. The commission was only 48 cents. An anonymous whale used the SegWit protocol, which reduced costs by 41%.  One of the Bitcoin users included the message Hello, Noah! Welcome to the world, little one in one of the transactions, thus recording the birth of their first child. The unchanging and censorship-resistant nature of Bitcoin will ensure that this message remains forever on the blockchain while it continues to function. The current case demonstrates a widely discussed scenario for using the first cryptocurrency as a decentralized database. **Hacking, Cyber Crimes**  Russian Sergei Medvedev admitted involvement in the cybercriminal organization Infraud, which traded stolen personal data, compromised credit cards, malware, and other illegal things. Over the course of its seven-year history, Infraud caused an estimated loss of about $2.2 billion and more than $568 million in actual losses to a wide range of financial institutions, sellers and individuals, the US Department of Justice declared.  The criminals received a $1.14 million ransom after a successful attack on the University of California. The software installed by hackers encrypted the data on the universitys servers at the School of Medicine, making the information temporarily unavailable. To fix the problem, the institution had to pay 116.4 BTC.  An unknown hacker managed to withdraw $500,000 in altcoins WETH, WBTC, SNX, and LINK from the pool of the Balancer Labs DeFi project using a smart contract vulnerability that allowed an attacker to create a shortage of funds in the pools. &amp;#x200B; Thats all for now!

Cybersecurity and blockchain technologies are emerging as business-critical skills and we are delivering the training that provides those skills in our workforce, noted Rupert Colester of IBM Australia. Australian National University, a top-20 school globally, also introduced blockchain law courses in collaboration with Ripple Labs earlier this year. The coursework explores the trend of legal framework and digital currencies while equipping graduates with all knowledge pertaining to cryptocurrencies and their place in global financial systems. Chinas parliament book As per local publication Weixin last week, the Central Party School of the Communist Party of China (CCP) published a book as part of an ongoing series on disruptive technologies, which includes AI, blockchain, machine learning, and other upcoming tech. Called A Dialogue With Party Leaders About Blockchain, the publisher aims to become a distinguished, trusted source on the topic of technology trends and markets itself to both party officials and the general public. The book goes back to the early ages to explain fiat currency, providing readers with a definite overview of how paper money came into being, the creation of credit and lending, how debt plagued the world, and finally, a number of negatives about the current financial system. Other chapters move on to explaining tokenization, ICOs, and an in-depth explanation about crypto-exchanges and their relevance in cross-border trade. Various regulatory stances and issues regarding digital currencies are discussed in the final chapters. Last year, the countrys prestigious Zhenjiang University launched a blockchain graduate course, while Chengdu University started a Bachelorss in Blockchain Studies this year. Koreas blockchain lab In Korea, weeks after the government mulled a $400 million blockchain fund, a top-ranking university is investing in blockchain- and fintech-based infrastructure to equip graduates with necessary skills. Daejeon University announced on May 26 the opening of it new fintech-focused lab called Future Convergence. Blockchain features majorly in the plans, with the university exploring ways to integrate the technology into smart cities, smart factories, and advancements in healthcare. The university notes knowledge of blockchain technology and fintech may bolster employment among Korean graduates, who suffer the ill-effects of a saturated job market. Officials, using a China-Esque philosophy, believe the adoption of newer technologies will foster talents for the fourth industrial revolution. Jobs prospects for new graduates are not great in Korea. A Reuters report from 2019 suggests thousands of highly-qualified students struggle to find work in the country, citing the presence of family-run chaebols and low overall openings as two major factors."

148,cybersecurity,btc,Craig Wright: The Real Satoshi Or The Real Scammer,0,c6b63e,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/c6b63e/craig_wright_the_real_satoshi_or_the_real_scammer/,2019-06-28 07:16:09,"Today we will focus on Craig Wright, the person who took the liberty to declare himself as true Satoshi Nakamoto and who tries to take all the credit of the creator of Bitcoin, the main cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is considered to be one of the progressive forms of payments  absolutely transparent, distributed and resistant to external influence. Its creator must be at least a genius, and most importantly, a billionaire  because a significant amount of Bitcoins mined in the early stages of the project is concentrated in his hands. It is known that Satoshi Nakamoto retired from the project around 2010 and no one knows exactly who is he really is. In December 2015, two American publications  Gizmodo and Wired  published huge investigations aimed at finding a man who has been hiding under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto since 2008. Clues led journalists to Craig Wright, a 45-year-old entrepreneur from Australia, which on many grounds could be reckoned as a true Satoshi. For example, there were publications about the ideas of a decentralized payment system similar to Bitcoin in Wrights blog in 2008, a year before Satoshi Nakamoto himself created BTC. Another interesting fact is that in 2013 he invested more than one million BTC in the project to create his Bitcoin Bank  supposedly only the creator of Bitcoin could own such amount of coins. In correspondence with the publications, Craig indirectly confirmed that he is Nakamoto. At the same time, in December, 2015, Wright said that he was not going to talk about himself publicly. But almost six months later Craig Wright appeared on the front pages. Unexpectedly for many, Craig decides to give an interview to the BBC and The Economist, in which once again, but already publicly assures that he is Satoshi Nakamoto. As the main proof, Wright provided a cryptographic signature from the private key used in the first Bitcoin transactions by Satoshi Nakamoto himself. Since then, Dr. Wright did not give up his words and continued to tell everyone that he is Satoshi. Later Craig said that he would sue anyone who slanders him and generally denies his merits in the creation of Bitcoin. And while he was just talking around declaring himself as the creator of BTC  all this was tolerated and ignored. But when Wright began to threaten all who disagreed with his lies, the crypto-community decided to teach him a lesson. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao wrote the following [on his Twitter](URL &gt;*Craig Wright is not Satoshi. Anymore of this sh!t, we delist!* His example was followed by some other exchanges, like ShapeShift and Kraken, which also announced the delisting of BSV. Blogger and ex-hacker Nik Cubrilovic and cybersecurity researcher Dan Kaminsky published their own investigations in which Wright is exposed as a great deceiver. Enthusiasts also investigated the activities of Wright and his companies. It turned out that the purpose of the existence of many of them was to draw tax refunds and the operation of other benefits that are provided to companies focused on research activities. When an entrepreneurs business started to decline and companies have earned an unpleasant reputation, Wright decides to appear before the public as Satoshi Nakamoto. According to Cubrilovics [opinion](URL this could improve Craigs affairs, attract new investments and add excitement since it is known that Nakamoto owns large amounts of Bitcoins. Craigs opponents also notice one detail: Satoshi Nakamoto would certainly stand on the side of the Bitcoin community that would like to leave the BTC system in its original form. However, in a conversation with The Economist Wright drew a different picture: if Bitcoin power can be repeatedly scaled, then it will be able to replace not only all banking systems but many others, becoming a truly mainstream currency. In this case, the regulation and support of such cryptocurrency would have to be taken up by large organizations  from banks, already interested in using blockchain technology, to entire states. If this happens, Bitcoin will really replace conventional currency but will lose its independence  the main reason for its creation. **Here are some interesting facts about Craig Wright:** 1. In the early 1990s, worked as a sauce cook at a French restaurant. 2. Wright filed about 114 Blockchain-related patents since 2017 3. Craig Wright has his own companies, for example, the Tulip Trading company, which has been very successful in developing supercomputers, as well as DeMorgan Ltd and Panopticrypt Pty Ltd, engaged in various operations with cryptocurrencies. But Wrights main project is, of course, his own Bitcoin SV (Satoshi Vision), which appeared as a result of the fork of Bitcoin Cash in November 2018. The forks reason was the dissatisfaction of developers and miners with a size of the blockchain that was originally written in code. Transactions were processed very slowly, so Bitcoin Cash ABC appeared, where the size was increased to 8 megabytes. But this was not enough for Craig Wright, and he initiated the second fork, setting the block size to 128 megabytes in the currency he was in charge of. 4. In February 2018 Wright was sued by David Kleiman  a computer scientist and cyber-security expert suspected to be one of the developers behind the Bitcoin and the blockchain tech. Kleiman said that Wright stole between 550,000 and 1,100,000 BTC. 5. In 2018, Craig Wright was sued, accusing him of forging contracts and signatures in order to assign Bitcoins in the amount of $5 billion. 6. In October 2017, Cointelegraph published a list of the most influential individuals from the blockchain industry. Not finding his name in it, Craig Wright appealed to the media with a comment about their negative mood regarding his personality. At the same time in the Cointelegraph ranking was the name Satoshi Nakamoto. This situation was noted as Wrights recognition that he is not the creator of Bitcoin. 7. Craig is suspected of repeatedly conducting operations to cash large amounts of BTC. During one of the checks, he brought the family from his native Sydney and moved to London to continue working and creating his own business. What do you think about Craig Wright?

It's shared with her permission, and I'll direct her to this thread so maybe she can answer questions if she has time under her own account. I can't wait for the Michael Mann's movie! . My original question was something along the lines of, ""Do you think that LeRoux could be Satoshi because of the timelines matching up roughly with the time that Satoshi disappeared and that LeRoux was arrested? Also their backgorunds in cryptography (E4M / Truecrypt / etc.)."" &gt;Thank you for writing me. I agree that it's fun to speculate about Paul LeRoux and what a man with his brainpower would make of cryptocurrency, the dark web and all sorts of marriages of technology and crime. But if youve read Hunting LeRoux, you know Ive had extensive and in some cases exclusive access to several people who know Paul LeRoux as well as anyone can. Ive concentrated on exploring his character, as they observed him at close range. Since that theory came out, Ive contacted all of them. The unanimous opinion is, no, hes not Satoshi Nakamoto. As I mentioned on my Twitter feed, he didnt have the necessary time to spend experimenting with a project whose money-making potential was uncertain at best. in the 1990s, he was hustling hard. He published E4M in 1998, as a means of advertising his skills, but he was also chasing IT jobs on several continents and looking to get married again. From 1999 to 2002, he was working long hours as CTO of SecurStar, a cybersecurity venture set up by Wilfried Hafner, LeRouxs mentor at the time. Hafner was close to LeRoux but fired him in 2002 when he discovered that LeRoux had pilfered and sold a valuable string of code developed by others in the company to operate security devices called crypto-tokens. After that, LeRoux went off to make his fortune and founded RX Limited as a star-up internet commerce pharmaceutical sales venture in 2004. His sites brought in $300 million in sales between 2007 and 2011, according to a DEA analysis. He never asked for payment in bitcoin or offered to pay for anything in bitcoin, as far as my sources know. He always took payment for pharmaceuticals in the form of credit card charges, usually VISA. He considered setting up his own bank and VISA franchise. For darker deeds, he wanted cash or gold bars. Iran paid him for an explosives formula with $5 million in gold bars. &gt; &gt;. &gt; &gt;In 2009, when bitcoin emerged, he was busy launching multiple ventures As I detailed in Hunting LeRoux, among these were small arms sales, trading in hard drugs, trading in smuggled gold, building a submarine, devising a new missile navigation system for Iran and setting up a new base in Somalia, where he intended to make himself into a white warlord, expanding his arms business into an Amazon-for-arms platform with fortified bases, his own militia, barracks, warehouses for arms, an airstrip, a seaport and so on. Significantly, he discovered oil on the land he controlled but declined to drill it, saying it would take too long to turn a profit. &gt; &gt;. &gt; &gt;To sum up, several associates say he might have the intellectual skills to participate in the invention of cryptocurrency, but he didnt have the resolve, patience, passion for that particular kind of secrecy or collaborative bent necessary to pull off such a feat. He was a man in a hurry for guaranteed results, fast, and he dropped a series of ideas that wouldnt deliver huge returns. He was a loner with no real friends and business partners. Theres a reason he demanded to be called Boss and regularly threatened to kill his senior lieutenants. &gt; &gt;. &gt; &gt;Now, however, no one discounts the possibility that he might be thinking of a new way to mine cryptocurrency or game the system. He is in a federal facility, awaiting sentence, and has a lot of time on his hands. &gt; &gt;. &gt; &gt;Best, &gt; &gt;Elaine Shannon &gt; &gt;Journalist and author, Hunting LeRoux, and other works [Twitter](URL [Website](URL"

151,cybersecurity,btc,I found a $600k BCH theft that has gone unnoticed,410,b5p7d3,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/b5p7d3/i_found_a_600k_bch_theft_that_has_gone_unnoticed/,2019-03-26 23:40:19,"Hello all, I'm (among other things) a graduate student getting a master's degree in cybersecurity. This last quarter for one of my classes, I was tasked to examine and recreate an exploit. For the actual exploit I was examining the ""anyone can spend"" segwit addresses on the BCH chain, and in my research I found a $600k theft that seems to have gone completely unnoticed. You all might recall [this](/r/Bitcoin/comments/7eixcu/recovering_bch_sent_to_segwit_addresses/) $600k theft of segwit addresses, but it happened again in mid-February and there has been zero news about it. [BCH block 517171](URL contains solely segwit-stealing transactions. If you look at any given transaction, the inputs are all segwit programs spending a P2SH segwit output. I only caught it by accident, as I was originally going to talk about the publicized November attack. The interesting thing I discovered about this was that it's harder to have stolen that segwit money than most people think. Both Unlimited and ABC nodes do not relay segwit-spending transactions, and Bitcoin ABC hard-coded in fRequireStandard, so you couldn't even relay them via CLI. On top of that, miners keep their node IPs private for obvious avoiding-ddos-and-sybil-attack reasons, which means it's impossible to directly send transactions to miners. This means that the only way to actually execute this attack was to setup one's own mining pool running on a custom-modified client to include allow non-standard transactions. Then you'd have to get enough hash power to mine a block yourself. I estimated the cost of renting enough hash power to do this at the time as around $30k-$60k to have a greater than 90% chance of mining a block within a 3 month window. In order to simulate the attack, I spun up BTC, LTC, and BCH nodes in Docker, and wrote a Python script. The Python script started at segwit activation on BTC and LTC and it scanned every transaction in every block looking for P2SH segwit inputs as well as native segwit outputs, since these are the necessary hash pre-images to spend P2SH segwit money on the BCH chain. The script then also scanned the BCH chain for any native segwit outputs, as well as recording all P2SH outputs. (This was all saved in a MySQL database.) Then, at any point in time, I could simply query for BCH unspent native segwit outputs as well as P2SH outputs for which I had a known segwit hash pre-image. (If this was an attack I was doing real-time, I would probably also have a large mempool on each node and monitor unconfirmed tx's for useful info as well, but since this was after the fact, I just queried blocks sequentially.) For the mining node that runs the pool, it would need to be firewalled behind (i.e. only connected to) an unmodified node in blocks-only mode, so that the segwit hash pre-images aren't transmitted out to the network, and so that no other unconfirmed transactions are transmitted in to the mining node. (The mining node should only be filling its block with segwit tx's in order to maximize the gain from the attack.) Then a script should run continuously to grab segwit utxos from the MySQL database and construct high-fee transactions to send directly to the mining node. Unlike the November attack, each input should be spent in its own individual transaction, so that in the event it is individually spent, I don't negate a tx with other inputs. The overhead on having different transactions for each input is only about 8 extra bytes (the tx version and the locktime), so I think this is a good trade-off. Then, the attacker simply rents hashing power and points it at his secret pool. By the time Februrary rolled around and the attack happened, my MySQL database had about 40 million BCH P2SH outputs and each query took about 3 minutes to execute. This of course would have been fine in the 10-minute block world of Bitcoin and BCH, but it means that I stopped my Python script after that time, so I don't know about any possible other attacks that happened before the clean stack rule was hard-forked into BCH. It was pretty interesting to work through how this attack must have happened, and it was significantly harder to execute than I thought it would be given that all the money was ""anyone can spend"". However, the most interesting thing about all this is that nobody has noticed. There is literally no news or mention of block 517171 or any of the transactions in it. My theory is that it is money that nobody misses -- i.e. misprogramed custom wallet software for BTC nodes accidentally also sent out BCH transactions to the same address, given that BTC and BCH shared the same history until August 2017. And whatever person or entity is running those nodes is only thinking about BTC money and is completely oblivious to its misprogrammed problem of shipping BCH to segwit P2SH addresses. Obviously, that's just a theory, but I think it's pretty reasonable. Given the intense community divide, I think it's very possible that a number of BTC users simply ignored money on the BCH chain, even though it's ""free money"" for them, simply out of ideological hatred. Whatever the case, nobody has posted anywhere complaining of money stolen in that block. It seems to have gone completely unnoticed. (Which is why I'm posting this.) It was an interesting case study and I'd be curious to hear if anybody has any addition information or thoughts about it. I believe this was a different person than the November theft, because the way it was done was different -- the November theft had all the money in one transaction, but this February theft was done with separate individual transactions. Additionally worth noting is that the address which received the bulk of the money is still active, which means they're still out there. Anyway, I thought this was interesting and worth posting."

161,cybersecurity,btc,Guys it's him - A unique assessment of why Craig Wright fits as Satoshi Nakamoto,3,4hista,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4hista/guys_its_him_a_unique_assessment_of_why_craig/,2016-05-03 03:41:44,"People are doing the obvious thing and looking for obvious proof, such as private key verification, where the slightest question mark renders proofs invalid. This is typical, but I'll outline a unique view showing a striking fit for Dr. Craig Wright as Satoshi. I'll say too I think the true identity of Satoshi is over emphasized. As Gavin says: good ideas stand on their own. **Match #1** The person in the world probably most qualified to make the call on the true identity of Satoshi is Gavin Andresen. Gavin worked with Satoshi most in the earliest days and is a renowned Bitcoin expert and computer scientist with a proven record demonstrating his talent and intelligence. It's true Gavin is human and all humans make mistakes, but someone like Gavin will mistakes far less for important issues where he's conscious of being careful. Personally, upon reading Gavin's blog post I was over 80% convinced Satoshi was Dr. Wright before doing any further research. **Match #2** I'd created a profile for Satoshi's real world identity by reading his earlier writings and listening to impressions of others (like Gavin) on him. Being in information technology for many years myself, reading some things Satoshi wrote (like shunning software dependencies when possible for projects) led me to believe he was someone familiar with and capable of writing software for important projects, but didn't do it primarily. I thought he might, for example, work with databases in some high security government agency. I found it interesting how naturally comfortable he seemed with various aspects of cryptography. Dr. Wright's Wikipedia profile fits: He was an adjunct lecturer in computer science and researcher at Charles Sturt University (so that matches not writing software full time). He worked in information technology for various companies, including OzEmail, K-Mart and the Australian Securities Exchange, as well as working as a security consultant for Mahindra &amp; Mahindra. That also fits, especially being a security consultant and working for a securities exchange. Wright also completed 18 SANS Institute courses and was the world's first person to receive GIAC certification in Compliance and Audits. The SANS Institute is a US company specializing in information security and cybersecurity training. Again that fits, and could explain the cryptography familiarity. It also fits something Gavin said about Satoshi seeming ""disciplined and careful"". **Match #3** ""Satoshi"" wrote perfect English! Why would somebody with a Japanese name or chosen moniker write perfect English? There could be several explanations, but Dr. Wright, being from Australia fits, especially since Satoshi used British spellings like 'colour' and 'defence'. Australia had British settlement in the late 18th century. Moreover, Australia has always had Asian influence given its geography. A Japanese sounding Moniker to obscure an Australian's identity makes sense. **Match #4** Satoshi probably wasn't from the U.S. or at least didn't grow up there. A big clue to Satoshi is Gavin saying he ""seemed different"" to himself and others, possibly older, as he did things like use reverse Polish notation. That means instead of writing 2 + 2 you'd write 2 2 +. A quick check shows this also fits. Satoshi didn't do this because he was older (Wright was born in 1970) he did it because he was from Australia. The reverse Polish scheme was proposed in 1954 and was independently reinvented in the early 1960s to reduce computer memory. The algorithms and notation *were extended by Australian computer scientist* Charles Hamblin. Computers can calculate in reverse Polish notation faster because parentheses (eg 3 - (4 x 5) ) are not needed. Programming languages use more difficult to parse infix notation (eg 2 + 2) due to its familiarity. This reminds me of how the QWERTY keyboard is the de facto standard for most typing (invented in America) although the DVORAK keyboard was later ergonomically designed for finger motion. It takes a view external to native born Americans to do things in a naturally different way. **Conclusion** These items push my confidence Craig Wright is Satoshi to over 90%. While my evidence isn't conclusive I feel it's compelling. A different Satoshi would be a real find. "
