A typical attack would capture a victims username and password and store it for an attacker to reuse later. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) or Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is commonly seen as a solution to these threats. 2FA adds an extra layer of authentication on top of the typical username and password. Two common 2FA implementations are one-time passwords and push notifications. One-time passwords are generated by a secondary device, such as a hard token, and tied to a specific user. These passwords typically expire within 30 to 60 seconds and cannot be reused. Push notifications involve sending a prompt to a users mobile device and requiring the user to confirm their login attempt. Both of these implementations protect users from traditional phishing campaigns that only capture username and password combinations. Real-Time Phishing While 2FA has been strongly recommended by security professionals for both personal and commercial applications, it is not an infallible solution. 2FA implementations have been successfully defeated using real-time phishing techniques. These phishing attacks involve interaction between the attacker and victims in real time. URL #infosec #cybersecurity"

We named this Digmine based on the moniker (  bot) it was referred to in a report of recent related incidents in South Korea. Weve also seen Digmine spreading in other regions such as Vietnam, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Vietnam, Philippines, Thailand, and Venezuela. Its not far-off for Digmine to reach other countries given the way it propagates. Facebook Messenger works across different platforms, but Digmine only affects Facebook Messengers desktop/web browser (Chrome) version. If the file is opened on other platforms (e.g., mobile), the malware will not work as intended. Digmine is coded in AutoIt, and sent to would-be victims posing as a video file but is actually an AutoIt executable script. If the users Facebook account is set to log in automatically, Digmine will manipulate Facebook Messenger in order to send a link to the file to the accounts friends. The abuse of Facebook is limited to propagation for now, but it wouldnt be implausible for attackers to hijack the Facebook account itself down the line. This functionalitys code is pushed from the command-and-control (C&amp;C) server, which means it can be updated. A known modus operandi of cryptocurrency-mining botnets, and particularly for Digmine (which mines Monero), is to stay in the victims system for as long as possible.
