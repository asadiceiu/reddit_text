Increased expansion of smartphones and the widespread of services like 4G LTE are anticipated to propel the industry growth in both developed and developing countries. Since the employees are more familiar with the devices which they personally owned and also they can execute tasks more proficiently with their own devices, thus promoting work productivity. Employees have exhibited a greater preference for employing the same device for professional as well as personal applications with the aim of avoiding the troubles like inconvenience and theft which is attributed to carrying two different devices. The requirement for carrying various devices and shifting from work to personal devices or vice versa is terminated. Defeating security worries offered by BYOD execution is among the key challenges for enterprises taking up this model. Potential security risks involve an unregulated intermediary approach to sensitive data, challenges in evaluating vulnerability to risk and tracing device theft, employees, and data with these gadgets leaving the company.

2,vulnerability,Technology_,"New tech that can stop Cyber Crime in it's tracks, and also fight back !",0,6upo8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Technology_/comments/6upo8u/new_tech_that_can_stop_cyber_crime_in_its_tracks/,2017-08-20 01:31:04,"**An End to Cyber crime as we know it** **A New Blueprint for Safe Software Applications** *We are No Longer Safe* We have all embraced the Internet, allowing it into every corner of our lives. But now, the gadgets that we have grown to love and depend upon have turned against us, providing an easy route for thieves and fraudsters to gain access to our money, jobs, identities, cars, homes and even our darkest secrets. The recent ransomware attacks on our Health Services and Utilities have put our very lives at risk. It is vital that something changes before our confidence is so badly damaged that we are forced to discard technology completely. OmniCommand is one of a group of companies that predicted this would happen, recognising that all our existing software platforms were based on 70-year-old technologies. Designed to be open, not secure, these aged software models offer thousands of different ways for criminals to enter a device and exploit it for their own purposes. Even the best defensive software could not hope to remove every vulnerability, (as our current range of expensive but often ineffective anti-virus solutions have proven). It was necessary to start again. To Invent a completely new way of writing and executing applications that would not have the same vulnerabilities. OmniCommand is using a type of Application Fabric technology that is based on a completely new model. * A model that makes it simple to totally lock down devices. * A model that can identify and repel attempts to attack it, even deploying active countermeasures where it makes sense to do so, (it can fight back!). * A model that can not only recognise if any part of a solution is compromised, but can rapidly and automatically heal it or replace it with a healthy solution. Best of all  it can already work on almost all the technology platforms and brands that we use today, from Watches and Smartphones to Laptops and Supercomputers. From Apple to Android and Windows. Preparing to Change the World After extensive research and development OmniCommand is in the advanced stages of testing and are now ready to start the process of identifying and selecting partners who want to be the first to benefit from this new technology. With the recent announcement that the UK government is going to fine companies who do not protect their systems, we believe that the time for change is now. OmniCommands CEO Ian Heron commented that: &gt;Anybody looking to make a significant investment in technology needs to consider the risks in investing in existing solutions. They have repeatedly failed to protect data, systems, money and even lives. We provide the only viable alternative for safer future operation. We want to see the end of Cybercrime as we know it  we believe our solution can deliver it. As of today, traditional software is obsolete. **For more information contact: Mike Waters CIO e: mike.waters@omnicommand.com | t: +44 7879 842673** "
