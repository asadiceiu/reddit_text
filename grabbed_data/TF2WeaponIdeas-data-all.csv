I was thinking this weapon could be changed to be a finisher weapon, combined with the utility of switching faster for all weapons and a speed boost on kill which can be useful for positioning. The reason the weapon switch speed is universal and not just a faster deploy speed is both because it makes more sense and i also think having that buff to The Heavy would be very interesting. Another interesting benefit The Heavy could use is the speed boost, which is great for positioning and catching up to enemies. The main trade-offs are both the DPS and a small damage vulnerability on wearer. The latter one is on wearer because there's another on wearer upside, so not having a downside for that wouldn't be ideal game design. I'll be honest that was sort of a slap-on downside because without it the weapon would be too OP, so if anyone has a suggestion for another on wearer downside i'd love to hear it. Same with feedback in general."

Or by marking the spy for death, making it far more obvious who is the spy. Or by simple not damaging buildings as much). Buildings gain critical hit vulnerability, which means that the Kritzkrieg and other sources of critical hits become far more powerful against sentry guns. Level One and Twos will be instantly destroyed from crockets and crit stickies, and Level Threes will be killed in two. Not to mention a critical burst from a heavy. The default downside, which is not disabling buildings, still give the engineer some leeway however. And to prevent this from being a straight downgrade in pub games (where, to be honest, nobody is going to time a kritz push with a sapper), buildings are also marked to death allowing any random damage to still deal minicrit damage. That was a long description, but I think this could be a decent alternative to the sapper (which has been sorely neglected by Valve, alongside Engineer PDA unlocks. Valve pls fix)"

It's also situational. Here's an attempt to fix that. --- **The Sun-on-a-Stick** *Level 1-100 RIFT fire mace* ~~**While on fire, hit an enemy to transfer the fire to them**~~ ~~**On hit: ignite the enemy on fire for two seconds**~~ ~~*+25% fire vulnerability on wearer*~~ ~~*-30% swing speed*~~ --- Behold, the huge amount of text to describe my thoughts: --- Note: the first upside adds the 2 seconds of fire to the first stat. This makes it so in certain cases where the first stat only originally giving 2 seconds of afterburn will actually do something (add with 2) instead of cancel out. Weapons that are too situational are problematic because sometimes the weapon can be overpowered in certain instances, but underpowered in others. While this is natural and fine in moderation, in excess it can make the weapon chaotic, often unbalanced, and a hassle to switch the weapon in an out to get the best of both worlds. Anyways, this change i believe is just about as well-rounded and balanced as it gets compared to the previous version. Two of the stats, the first upside and downside, both have to do with being on fire and it's entirely subjective which one to use since it depends on your playstyle. The second upside and downside are also a dichotomy. If anybody suggests just taking the first upside and downside and making this weapon that simple, i would say that's a fine idea but overall having these four stats gives the weapon more character. Also something about it being stock except for when you're on fire seems iffy. Overall these changes offer the weapon a hit-and-run, as well as a risk and reward type of playstyle. It also provides the utility of getting rid of your fire which is nice for the scout if you don't want to use the mad milk. The cost is a higher risk and a worse performance to use consecutively. The DPS of the stock bat is 70, while this weapon (including the damage you get from the burn time) is 76.5 so there's more damage for one swing in total than stock. However, the fire doesn't stack for multiple hits so the average DPS you'll get is about 64 so not as much as default. Feedback is appreciated!"

As they enter, they see icy blood and many bodies. They enter trough a broken-open metal door. On the way inside, they see many bodies and metal scrap piles. They look into many of the rooms. In one of them, Heavy and the gang find the person who contacted them, with his head cut off and his hand laying on the keyboard. They move on and reach a room with sounds coming from it. They enter it quietly and see an army of robots securing many boxes with name labels of with were from the list sent to Heavy. After a moment, a robot arrives, which seems to be a ""general"" of the operation, commands the robots to find the remaining Australium in the facility. Medic accidentally makes a noise and so alarms the robots. The gang starts fighting against the robots. Heavy, together with Medic, meet up with the general, who calls himself ""General Medic"", armed with a Crossbow and an bersaw. Heavy and the general duke it out and it seems that Heavy is losing, that's when the general gets ambushed by Sniper and Engineer. While the general is distracted, Heavy opens a few crates and takes some of the weapons. The General fights off the gang and is about to kill them, but is stopped by a irritating roar behind him. He turns his head to see an enraged Heavy with the **Gulag Crusher** and the **Moscow Protection**. He rushes towards the robot, smashes him into the wall and destroys it as fast as he can. After a few moments, the robot was crushed and it was quiet for a moment. Heavy then picks up a walkie-talkie from the robot from which one can hear the Administrators voice yelling in rage.

Basically, this Pomson is meant for Crowd Control, piercing enemies and affecting a somewhat large area. Instead of draining Cloak and ber, this one just Mini-Crits against Sneaking Frenchmen. **RESCUE RANGER:** * Alt-Fire: Use 100 metal to pick up buildings from long range. * Fires a special bolt that can repair a friendly building for 30% of its health. * 34% Smaller Clip * 50% Less Primary Ammo Carried * Marked for Death while carrying a building * Repairing a building costs 4 Metal per Health Point This is a change that more affects MvM than regular gameplay, and was prompted by me trying to use the Rescue Ranger to repair my Dispenser from a distance, only to discover that my Building Health Upgrades are causing it to heal for relatively pitiful amounts. **WRANGLER/GIGER COUNTER:** * Allows you to take manual control of your Sentry Gun. * While Deployed: Take 66% Less Damage from your Sentry Gun's Bullets * Sentries are disabled for three seconds after being wrangled. Gets rid of the Wrangler Shield to decrease the effective health of a wrangled Sentry. In its place, there's now a stat to aid people with Sentry Jumping. **SHORT CIRCUIT:** * Launches an energy ball that destroys nearby projectiles. * Deals Mini-Crits against Wet Players. * Costs 65 Metal to Fire. * Mini-Crits when it would normally Crit * Deals 25% Less Damage against Buildings. * No Random Crits. Gets rid of the somewhat pointless Primary Fire and moves Alt-Fire to that slot. Because honestly, have you ever seen anyone who knows what they're doing use the Primary Fire? Oh, also, I removed the stat about picking up buildings because that's no longer an issue, and I changed its interaction with Crit-Boosts. And I added the stat about Wet Players because why not? **SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY:** * On hit: Knock back an enemy and cause them to bleed for 3 seconds. * \+100% Damage against buildings * While deployed: +15% Damage Vulnerability * No random crits Because the current Southern Hospitality is boring. This one has the added bonus of knocking back people you hit with it, as well as removing Sappers in one hit (and also destroying enemy buildings faster, I guess). However, the 20% Fire Vulnerability has been changed to a 15% Vulnerability to everything while it's active. Basically, this is made for getting Spies (and anyone else who's too close for comfort) out of your face and fixing whatever they broke. However, the Damage Vulnerability does lead to problems with being caught unaware."

Upon being upgraded to Level 2, a panel opens up in the top, and a Siren comes out. Just like the Regular Dispenser, it costs 100 Metal to Build. The Armored Frontline Dispenser has a Shorter Hitbox, making it slightly harder to hit. It also has a passive 35% Resistance to Ranged Attacks and a 15% Vulnerability to Melee Attacks (Think Fists of Steel). It also goes through its deployment and upgrading animations 50% faster than the regular Dispenser, and can only be upgraded to Level 2.

On either side of the light, there are two team-colored pillars crackling with electricity. It costs 125 Metal to Build. It has the same deploy speed as an Entrance Teleporter. Since it is a separate building from the Speed Booster, a sapper on the Speed Gate will not be applied to the Speed Booster. When an ally walks between the pillars, electricity surges between the pillars, they receive a 10-second Speed Boost, and the Gate enters Cooldown for a level-dependent amount of time. There is no visual difference between levels. During Cooldown, the pillars do not have any electricity on them, and the glowing panel is a dull gray. |*Level*|*Health*|*Cooldown Length*| |:-|:-|:-| |1|90|8 sec| |2|120|5 sec| |3|156|2 sec| # Meet the Speed Booster A small, slowly spinning device that looks like a short, team-colored jet engine laid on its back, with the sides of teleporters on all four directions. Upon being upgraded to Level 2, it will spin slightly faster, and the engine will glow either Orange or Light Blue. Just like a Teleporter, it costs 50 Metal to Build. However, it goes through its deployment and upgrading animations 50% faster than a Teleporter, and can only be upgraded to Level 2. Since it is a separate building from the Speed Gate, a sapper on the Speed Booster will not be applied to the Speed Gate. When an ally enters within a 100 Hammer Unit range of the Speed Booster, they receive a Speed Boost that lasts as long as they are in the Booster's Range, as well as for a level-dependent number of seconds after they leave its range. |*Level*|*Health*|*Duration*| |:-|:-|:-| |1|125|1 sec| |2|175|3 sec| # Design Philosophy As stated earlier, these buildings are meant to be more Offensive Options for Engie; consider this PDA the Gunslinger to the Building Constructor's Wrench. The Armored Frontline Dispenser is a much tankier building than the regular dispenser, with a Passive Fists Of Steel effect and a smaller hitbox. Stats-wise, its Level One is between the regular Dispenser's Level One and Level Two, and its Level Two is between the regular Dispenser's Level Two and Level Three. This extra tankiness would theoretically allow the Frontline Dispenser to be placed closer to where the action is. However, to balance this, it can't quite match the Vending Capacity of a Level Three Dispenser. I chose to not give it a Level Three so that it's faster to upgrade to maximum capacity, and so I wouldn't have to think of a midpoint that wasn't the Level Two Dispenser, or make a completely worthless Level One. In modes where the objective is always shifting, such as Payload or Attack/Defend, or on more compact maps, such as Hightower or Watergate, maintaining an Exit Teleporter near the front lines can be slightly impractical or just plain unnecessary. So, for Offense Engie, I decided to throw out Teleporters altogether and replace them with two kinds of Speed Pad-type buildings. The Speed Gate provides much longer Speed Boosts, but can only affect one person at a time, and is extraordinarily fragile. To balance this, the Speed Booster provides, smaller, AoE boosts, and has more health. The Speed Gate is meant to help freshly-respawned players into battle, while the Speed Booster is made for the frontlines. Combined with the Gunslinger and one of Engie's more Offensive Primaries (and possibly [this other weapon idea I made a while back](URL a Frontline Formation Engineer can become the core of their team's offensive endeavors, providing Health and Ammo, giving Speed Boosts, and getting Kills.

24,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,Balance Change Ideas: Demoknight,1,hc3w3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/hc3w3b/balance_change_ideas_demoknight/,2020-06-20 02:33:55,"Ive been thinking about some balance changes Id potentially like to see. These arent very in-depth but I just thought it would be worth sharing them with people who might be interested. Demoknight: If random crits were removed (which is looking like an increasingly popular idea) the Scotsmans skullcutter would be made more or less redundant. The claidheamh mor is also in a pretty terrible spot, and the Persian Persuader is fun, but not massively effective. Because of this, I think the demoknight weapons could really do with a re-work. We all know the Eyelander can be an incredibly powerful tool at 8+ heads, with 235 health, as well as increased shield charge damage and movement speed. Paired with the Targe the user is a tank, paired with the Screen the user is like a charging bull with the potential to take out fully overhealed heavies, and with the Turner they can come out of nowhere, gain another head and be out of the incredibly fast. What Im suggesting, is that a similar Heads mechanic be added to all of the demoknight swords, as well as a small buff to the Targe as I feel it is the least impressive of the shields. The ChargenTarge: As it stands the Targe offers significant fore and explosive resistance, as well as a guaranteed crit at the end of a charge. While this is still functional, it is the least fun of the shields, so I would suggest adding a bullet resistance (say, 15-20%) or an increased health buff (+20/25 hours). Or go down the silly route and make it do bleed damage on impact cos of the spike :). The Swords: The Eyelander: The Eyelander is in a very good place, and has been since its implementation into the game. The more kills you get, the tankier you become, with increased move speed and shield charge damage too. I cant really suggest a change, other than maybe making the shield charge effect deal more damage. Im also going to be adding the effect to almost all the swords. The Scotsmans Skullcutter: The skullcutter is in a great place at the moment, for the SOLE reason, that its has the ability to randomly crit. This is furthered by its increased damage ramping up the crit rate after a few swings. However, if random crits WERE to be removed, (which could be likely) then this weapon would be left in the dust, along with the stock bottle and other critting melees. I suggest the following stats: -10% move speed (buffed from 15%) +10% damage (nerfed from 20%) no random crits On kill: Grants five second speed boost (+25%, does not stack) Grants permanent damage buff (+12%, capped at 4 heads, roughly 100 damage.) Grants permanent speed debuff (-1.25% capped at 4 heads, -15% move speed penalty in total.) Increased shield charge damage (same as Eyelander.) The Claidheamh Mor: This sword has had it rough over recent years, with all sorts of tweaks and changes, it still isnt great. The damage vulnerability is terrible- the health on kill is and the shield charge length increase is useful, but strange. I suggest the following stats: +0.2 seconds shield charge time (nerfed from +0.5) +20% shield charge damage -10% damage resistance (buffed from -15%) no random crits On kill: Grants permanent +0.2 seconds shield charge time (capped at 4 heads, which is a full second of charge time. Grants 35 health (cannot overheal) Grants permanent damage vulnerability (-2%, capped at 4 heads, leads to -20% damage vulnerability. Grants increased shield charge damage (same as Eyelander, +20% from the base stats) Persian Persuader: The Persuader is one of the more fun swords for demo, and is most effective when used with the tide turner to charge ALL the time. I suggest the following stats: Melee hits refill 10% of your charge meter (nerfed from 20%) Ammo boxes give charge -50% max primary/secondary ammo on wearer (buffed from -80%) -60% shield charge damage no random crits On kill: Grants permanent +5% to charge meter on melee hit (capped at 4 heads, up to 30% on hit) Grants permanent +5% swing speed (capped at 4 heads, up to 20% increase- I thought this would make sense as its the only one-handed sword for demo) Thats it for the swords, as I think the zatoichi is fine where it is. The only other buff would be to the wee booties/bootlegger, I think that all of the effects should take place even without a shield. Thanks for reading all of that, and Id love some feedback of you guys wouldnt mind!"
25,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,Baby Face's Blaster rework,1,hce2b0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/hce2b0/baby_faces_blaster_rework/,2020-06-20 12:26:17,"This is considered one of the worst weapons in Scout's arsenal and for good reason, all it takes is a few pistol shots and you lose all your boost. Here is my idea for a rework of this weapon. Baby Face's Blaster: \+20% increased move speed while weapon is active. \+50% less weapon spread. This weapon fires a fixed shot pattern. \-10% firing speed for every missed shot, to a maximum of -50%. This is reset either by going to a resupply cabinet or by doing more than 50 damage in one shot with this weapon. (This is shown by a simple counter in the HUD showing how many shots you have missed, which is reset upon hitting a shot for 50 damage) Note that shots that do not do more than 50 damage but still hit someone do not count as missed shots but they also don't reset the counter. \-25% damage vulnerability to sentries while weapon is active. \-10% damage. As you can see I've decided to completely scrap the boost mechanic in favor of only having the speed buff while the weapon is active. The boost mechanic was IMO flawed to begin with, the weapon ended being this thing where all of it's downsides served to deplete your boost meter which made filling the meter up less of a reward and more of an annoying chore. Imagine if the Bazaar Bargain was nerfed so that if you missed a headshot or you took more than 50 damage than the head counter would reset and you were left with a sniper rifle that prevented you from actually using it's upsides, that was how the Baby Face's Blaster was nerfed, by removing the boost meter we can find different nerfs for the weapon instead of it constantly negating it's own upsides. The main idea of this weapon rework is that it rewards you with great speed at the cost of forcing you to be extremely precise with your shots, which is very difficult to do while running circles around your enemies. The other downside is that you are hard countered by engineers, especially gunslinger engineers who can shut you down by simply placing a mini-sentry in an inconvenient spot. As a result of these downsides I imagine those who hypothetically would use this rework would use it in conjunction with either the pistol or Bonk in order to help work around any sentries. Would this rework be balanced? Tell me in the comments below."

Thanks! The description has the link to the original post on this subreddit. --- ##Weapon ideas: --- **THE WAR DRUM** *[Level 1-100 Shotgun](URL ~~**Hold fire to load up to 4 shots and release to fire in quick succession**~~ ~~**+50% reload speed**~~ ~~*Firing speed decreases the longer you hold in your shots*~~ ~~*-20% accuracy penalty*~~ So this works very similarly to how the panic attack used to be. People loved the old design when you could hold in shots, but the tf2 team changed it and removed the feature of loading shots. I like the current version so i don't think it would be good to change it back, so that creates an opportunity to create a new weapon! One difference between this and the original panic attack besides the health variable is the ""Firing speed decreases the longer you hold in your shots"" downside. This is to promote people for not holding their shots in to have better timing. Don't worry, the maximum decrease is about the default fire speed of the shotgun. --- **THE DISPENSER PROJECTOR** *[Level 1-100 Medigun](URL ~~**Healing restores ammo capacity passively**~~ ~~**Able to heal buildings**~~ ~~**While healing, teammates near you are slowly healed**~~ ~~*-10% heal rate*~~ ~~*-20% overheal build rate*~~ ~~Ubercharge: double healing rate, crit resistance, and knockback resistance~~ So this weapon, as per the title, is based on the Engineer's dispenser. It's supposed to look like the dispenser, and canonically i want the origin of it to be the Engineer helping the Medic build it. --- **THE ROGUE'S RAPIER** *[Level 5 Thin Sword](URL ~~**On backstab: Lounge forward and attacks pierce players**~~ ~~**Blocks melee attacks at close range every couple seconds**~~ ~~**+30% damage bonus**~~ ~~*-25% swing speed*~~ ~~*-7% movement speed while active*~~ ~~*This weapon has a longer melee range and deploys and holsters slowly*~~ Some important changes include switching the numbers for the swing speed and damage bonus (only 5% but it is still significant), and adding the suggestion that the blocked melee attacks have a cooldown so they aren't reliable. If anybody is worried this may be too powerful, the melee attacks with the 30% damage bonus only does 52 damage and you'll be moving at average speed. This weapon is supposed to be defensive and tactical. And finally, i feel like this could be part of a set for the spy but i have no ideas. If anybody does let me know because that would be cool. --- **DISPENSER BACKPACK** *[Level 5 Wearable Tech](URL ~~While active:~~ ~~**5 health and metal regenerated per second in a small radius**~~ ~~**Damage taken from behind damages dispenser first**~~ ~~*-5% movement speed*~~ ~~*Cannot upgrade, repair, or boost construction speed of the dispenser*~~ ~~*Hidden: +50% construction speed and +75% range*~~ First off, this is not a secondary but rather a dispenser blueprint. That's a new concept of mine that makes the PDA slot a menu where you can replace individual buildings, but all you have to know is that this is intended to be a sidegrade. Anyways, this and my original idea have remained largely the same except for a slightly faster speed while the dispenser is there. --- **THE SOVIET STANDOFF** *[Level 5 Boxing Gloves](URL ~~While active:~~ ~~**On hit: You and the opponent are locked into a melee battle**~~ ~~**Enemy cannot deal random critical hits while in a melee battle**~~ ~~*25% melee damage vulnerability*~~ ~~*-50% deploy speed*~~ ~~*-20% damage penalty*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~The winner gains a large health pack and 5 seconds of mini-crits~~ ~~Hidden: Each hit resets a four second timer to prevent abandonment~~ Okay so this weapon is for heavies who like melee battles. A huge part of this is being fair, so fighting a 125 health class will do 3 hits and assuming they hit you with a 65 damage hit, the increase of damage will be able to kill you in 4 hits. Compared with the heavy's slow speed, this is almost even. However, Note: with such a unique mechanic, it may be hard to tell whether or not this weapon is balanced. I think it should be play-tested thoroughly. One small last thing: there are some sound effects included for this weapon. For example, you know the boxing 'ding ding' sound? That plays at the start of a melee battle :) --- **THE HOOKSHOT** *[Level 12 Grappling Hook Gun](URL ~~**Fires a grappling hook that can pull you to enemies or surfaces**~~ ~~**Able to use while cloaked**~~ ~~*-80% clip size*~~ ~~*-75% ammo capacity*~~ ~~*-50% damage penalty*~~ This is a primary weapon for spies that want to trade the damage output and reliability of the revolver with mobility to get to places where you can backstab easier. An example of using this is getting to hard to reach places to go behind enemy lines or to higher ground. The ""Able to use while cloaked"" stat may seem overpowered but keep in mind if you use it on an enemy, you'll have to uncloak to do anything else and they'll be able to see you bump into them. This upside is for mobility while invisible, a lower chance enemies will be able to track you, and maybe to kill a target that has like 20 health left. --- **THE BOOTLEGGER** *[Level 1-100 Boots](URL ~~**+25 max health on wearer**~~ ~~**-25% bomb arm time**~~ ~~**-40% blast damage from sticky jumps**~~ Important: this does not affect the Wee Booties, this is an idea to make them separate weapons. Okay so my original idea got negative feedback and i completely agree. The speed bonus would be way too overpowered. So what i did is replaced it with a blast damage resistance from stickybombs, similar to the gunboats. Also the bomb arm time buff is to make it pair better with the scottish resistance and not make it too fast with the quickiebomb launcher. With a -0.2 arm time, it would barely affect the scottish resistance and be arguably too good with the quickiebomb launcher. This makes using both of them decent contenders as well as stock. --- **La Seringue** *[Level 1-100 Syringe](URL ~~**On backstab: gain a life point. Each life point can be used to heal yourself or a teammate which may overheal**~~ ~~**Healing yourself or a teammate does not remove disguise**~~ ~~*-20% swing speed*~~ ~~*-30% healing received on wearer*~~ Important: huge props to [this post](URL for what i think is what this is inspired from. They did this much better than my old post. Anyways, this is a knife that has the capabilities of being supportive to your team! You can choose to give the health to yourself or your team, acting as a medium health pack on yourself and a large health pack for your team. You heal yourself by looking down and stabbing if you have a life point. However, backstabs take priority so if there's a player to backstab you'll do that instead of healing yourself."

When they went to Japan to ""pick them up"", it was said that the weapons where shipped to an American harbor far north. After calculations, Engineer located the weapons at an Alaskan harbor and travel there. As soon as they arrive, they disguise themselves as fishermen and sneak into the located depot. After going inside and sneaking even more, they are spotted and are greeted by Dr. Grordbort, the mad scientist. He surround them with robots of his own and explains his plans, including his plan to lure them into this trap. He then presents a giant Pyro robot with Pyro as the ""battery"" fitted out with the Moonman Pack. He activates it and it starts attacking them. They quickly destroy the small robots and hid for cover, while the Pyro-bot starts burning the place. Engineer notices that the crate their hiding behind are filled with the weapons for Heavy and they quickly make a new plan. Heavy opens one of the crate and starts shooting the Razrusheniye, dealing a lot of damage, distracting the robot from Engineer and Sniper, who try to stop Dr, Grordbort. They intensively fight and Engineer loses his wrench, which flies at the ""batteries"" glass and cracks it. It breaks, deactivating the robot and freeing Pyro.

This would leave the Pyro with 132% movement speed (1% slower than a scout) and 210 health. Obtaining kills after 4 heads will heal for 15 hp, and can grant overheal Honourbound: Putting away the weapon will take away 50 health unless a kill has been achieved with it beforehand. If below 50 health, the weapon will not be able to be put away +20 Damage Vulnerability while active: All Damage sources deal 20% more damage while this weapon is deployed -50% Holster Speed: The weapon takes 0.75 seconds to put away rather than 0.5 seconds -25 Max Health: Pyro starts with 150 health, not 175 **AUTHORS NOTES:** My intention is for this weapon is to be a melee weapon for the Pyro that is used actively rather than passively, like the Axtinguisher. Most other melees are mostly used for purposes other than swinging, or (in the homewreckers case) swinging at things that arent players. I wanted this to be different from the Axtinguisher (the first draft was basically an Axtinguisher-Powerjack hybrid) and I wanted to avoid fill u a meter and get buffed since the Pyro already had the Phlog. So, I opted for a weapon that would buff the Pyro over time and reward using melee to finish off opponents for more than a few seconds This weapon is inspired by the community Frontline! update, go check it out at Frontline.tf (Im not associated with them in any way I just like the idea)"

That's when he sees a letter from his hometown Bee Cave. He starts reading it. It's an invitation to the 50th anniversary rodeo to defend the family title. He quickly packs some things and leaves. As he arrives, he is surprised with a festival with weapon markets, tech depots and grillers with brisket, bacon and steaks. As Engineer enters the festival, it suddenly becomes quiet and everyone starts staring at him. He goes past the crowd and enters the ring. But this time, new rules were made for this anniversary: Guns are allowed in the ring and anyone can jump into it. So, right before the clock reaches noon, Engineer and the bull, as well as the other people are in a stand-off position. And as it teaches noon, Engineer smiles and quickly pulls out his **Lone Star Original** and yells ""Yeeeehaaawww!!!!"" and fires his gun.

51,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,"Weapon Rework Stockpile : Baby Face's Blaster, Hitman's Heatmaker, Buff Banner, Gas Passer, Equalizer, Claidheamh Mr.",1,gst0py,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/gst0py/weapon_rework_stockpile_baby_faces_blaster/,2020-05-29 23:28:31,"While I've previously reworked weapons that barely worked, I'll now rework weapons that are functional but either too situational or too flawed. As you can see I picked 2 primaries, 2 secondaries and 2 melee weapons for variety. &amp;#x200B; * **Baby Face's Blaster :** The BFB used to be the best scattergun after the Two Cities update, allowing you to outrun your hitbox forever, but was then nerfed into obscurity during Gun Mettle. So my job here is to restore only part of its former glory, in order to keep it balanced yet effective, so I'll only need to thinker with the Boost mechanic : \+ Boost no longer decays upon taking damage or jumping; it will only decay at a rate of 5 points per second. \+ 40% extra accuracy. \- Full Boost now requires 150 points of damage. \- Boost will decrease accuracy (up to -25% accuracy at max charge). \- No double jump. So the BFB will now be a weapon with a higher skill ceiling that requires Scout to hit his shots constantly, which will be harder with more Boost because of its increasing spread. Yet it will be a more forgiving weapon thanks to the fact it is more accurate at lower levels of Boost. &amp;#x200B; * **Hitman's Heatmaker :** The HH is another meter-based weapon in need of a buff. Although it is viable in some situations, it needs to do its job better : chaining kill after kill after a few successful shots. So I'll rework it from the ground up, meaning that the focus meter and the bodyshot damage penalty will have to go (but let's keep the tracer rounds) : \+ Upon getting a scoped kill, you will remain scoped in, your reload will 50% faster and your next shot will charge 50% faster. \- Upon hitting a non-lethal shot, you will reload at a 20% slower rate and the next shot will charge 15% slower. \- Upon missing, you will reload at half speed, your next shot will charge 50% slower and you will be marked for death for 5 seconds. \- You can't switch weapons until your next shot is loaded. This new rework would allow for higher highs yet lower lows : you either kill an entire team in quick succession, or deal negligible damage to some enemies and be an easy target. &amp;#x200B; * **Buff Banner :** The Buff Banner is a good utility, but it lacks what all of its counterparts have : a passive effect that helps Soldier survive until the buff is ready. So let's fix that : \+ 15% faster reloading speed for your primary. Soldier can thus have an advantage in longer engagements and gets more from the effects of the buff with faster reloading. &amp;#x200B; * **The Gas Passer :** The Gas Passer is only ever used in MVM because of its ""Explode on Ignite"" upgrade. But it also sees no use in actual matches because of weird design decisions that make it sluggish, and it also has a few bugs : \+ The canister will now recharge just like any other throwing projectile : it will be resupplied directly upon respawning or hitting a resupply cabinet and recharge exactly in 30 seconds (so no reduction in recharge time by burning people). \+ The recharge time will be shortened by 5 seconds when you extinguish a teammate with your airblast. \~ The canister can no longer get thrown through walls. \~ Enemies coated in gas will be considered wet until ignited. Now, the Gas Passer will be more comfortable to use and encourages the Pyro to extinguish teammates, cementing him in a more supportive role. &amp;#x200B; * **The Equalizer :** The Equalizer is the worst melee for Soldier, despite not being said in the stats, it deals half damage at full health, but even then, the extra damage is not worth it. I've come up with a more profitable way of determining the extra damage, while keeping the ""damage makes me angry"" mentality of the weapon : \+ Berserk meter : upon taking damage, the Berserk meter will fill up (takes 200 damage to fill to the max). Your next attack will deal extra damage based on the level of Berserk you have (increases the damage by 1% per point in the meter, up to 200% extra damage). At full charge, your next hit with the Equalizer will do a crit. Upon landing a hit on a target, the meter will go back to 0. \+ 50% faster deploying speed. \- 50% damage penalty. \- 25% health received from healers at all times. \- No random crits. The weapon is now a finishing tool that also allows you to save yourself when low on health and close to your target as its power is more controllable. It also pairs up better with the passive effects of the banners. Yet, Soldier has to sacrifice a reliable melee for longer close quarters engagements and reliable healing from Medics and Dispensers. &amp;#x200B; * **The Claidheamh Mr :** This sword has certainly seen better days, as it was ruined by its general damage vulnerability stat. But I want to also give it a bit more life, so let's only keep its charge refill on kill : \+ Upon killing someone you get their head, each head increases the duration of your charges by 0.25 seconds as well as their control by 10%, up to 1 extra second of charging and 40% more control with 4 heads. \- Minus 25 max HP \- 10% slower swinging speed. The Claidheamh Mr will now shine once again : the health subtraction is compensated by the boots and gives the players a more trust worthy display of their remaining health. It also allows for increasingly better charges thanks to the heads system as well as more control which allows better pairing with the Chargin' Targe and the Splendid Screen. Yet, your ability to fight without charging in will be lessened by the slower swings and the health penalty. Thanks for reading. As always, feedback is recommended."

71,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,THE RUSSIAN BLOCUS: a primary weapon Riot Shield for Heavy.,1,fmd16q,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/fmd16q/the_russian_blocus_a_primary_weapon_riot_shield/,2020-03-21 21:30:07,"Some people around the TF2 community have had the idea to give Heavy a shield, he's a tank class after all. So here's my take on this idea with its unique stats: \+ The shield will cover your front almost perfectly (your shins and feet can still be seen and damaged normally, unless you're crouching). The shield will block any direct damage (bullets, arrows, syringes, regular flares, direct grenades and beams) nullifying them (it's basically a hitbox right in front of you). \+ Get a 50% knockback reduction that increases to 100% when crouched. \+ Get a 50% fire, explosion and melee damage reduction from the front (fire particle hitting your shield will still damage you but with this reduction). \+ Cannot be affected by Afterburn if you were hit from the front. \+ Penetration effects (Righteous Bison, Machina, fire particles) do not work against you. \+ *Primary Fire*: Heavy bashes with his shield, dealing 50 damage and knocking them back (similar to the Short Stop's Shove knockback / can be crit boosted). Be aware that you'll reveal yourself while doing it. \+ *Secondary Fire*: Heavy will rush a short distance, dealing 25 damage and knocking aside ennemies in his path slightly; can only be used once every 5 seconds (can be crit boosted). \+ You do not get a speed penalty when strafing or backing up (so you strafe and move backwards at the same speed as your current forward walking speed). \- You loose the offensive capabilities of a Minigun (duh). \- Although you're protected from the front, the shield does not prevent splash damage from explosions (rockets, pills, stickies, Short Circuit balls as well as Detonator and Scorch Shot flares) or hazards (saws on Sawmill for example). \- Get a 10% damage vulnerability from the back. \- *Recoil*: crits from explosive weapons as well as melee attacks will make Heavy recoil when blocking the attack, revealing himself for a second. \- Very slow equipping and holstering speeds. \- Cannot be overhealed while the shield is active. &amp;#x200B; *Interactions:* \*Grenades that hit your shield directly will detonate as if this was a direct hit, but you won't take the 100 damage this would usually yield, rather you take 50% of the splash damage, same goes for rockets. \*Scorch Shot flares will explode on your shield rather than bonce on it as if they were a player. \* Friendly Crusader's Crossbow shots will not go through your shield, so he need to hit you from the back or the sides to heal you with it. &amp;#x200B; *Potential MVM upgrades:* **The Russian Blocus** could be a pretty interesting weapon to bring to MVM, Heavy could work as a money collector with more of a focus on tanking damage for his team: \**Strongmann:* Decreases the amount of splash damage you take from explosives that hit your shield, level 1 also disables the Recoil mechanic (-25% splash damage per level, 2 levels, costs 250 bucks). \**Healthy Economy:* Allows Heavy to magnetize money (radius increases per level) and heal 5/10/15/25 HP for each pile of money he gets. Level 1 also removes the ""no overheals"" stat (4 levels, costs 350 bucks). \**Bolchevik Berzerker:* Pressing reload will ""taunt"" the targeted robot, forcing them to attack you for at least 5/10 seconds. You will heal 100/150 HP if the taunted target gets killed (15 seconds cooldown, 2 levels, costs 500 bucks). \**Soviet Slammer:* Your shield bash now deals +100/200/300% damage and +50/100/150% knockback. At level 2, shield bashes will also destroy projectiles and at level 3, it will reflect them instead (3 levels, costs 400 bucks). The weapon can also get the *Faster swing speed*, *Health on kill* and *Crit on kill* stats swords get. &amp;#x200B; Since this is an extremely experimental weapon type, feedback is encouraged."
72,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,"A random assortment of Reworks (The Classic, Pompson, Short Circuit, Shortstop and Enforcer).",1,fn0k3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/fn0k3v/a_random_assortment_of_reworks_the_classic/,2020-03-23 01:15:14,"I've decided to rework a couple unrelated weapons I take issue with, whether they're terrible, need fixing or need a better gimmick: &amp;#x200B; * **The Classic:** As all of you might acknowledge, The Classic is the top contender for the title of ""Worst weapon in the game"", that is due to the fact you need to fully charge in order get headshots and the uselessness of its gimmick. So I propose to rebuild it from scratch and turn it into an actual ""classic sniper rifle"": \+ Deals +100% damage when shooting the torso and head or when shooting buildings (deals 100 damage, 300 damage for crits / shooting the arms deal the original 50 damage). \+ No laser for extra stealth. \~ Killed ennemies explode when killed. \- Cannot charge shots. \- Slower firing speed (2 second interval between shots). \- 50% damage penalty when shooting under the belt (deals 25 damage under the belt). \- Now operates with a clip (5 rounds per clip + 20 carried ammo, 2.5 seconds reload time). \- Fires tracer rounds. \- +3 degrees deviation for bullets when unscoped. So now The Classic works more closely like a sniper rifle in other FPS games, it rewards accuracy with extra damage while penalizing missed shots with slower firing and clips to reload. It can kill any class (without overheal or damage resistances) in a single headshot, yet can't oneshot any class at full health (except for Kuna and Big Earner users). &amp;#x200B; * **The Pompson 6000:** The Pompson is kinda like COVID-19: it's not very lethal but still very annoying because of some of the side effects it has. It should be used as a long range poking tool to scare away people that shoot your sentry out of their range, so let's buff it after we remove its On-hit effects (-10% uber and -20 % cloak): \+ Fires projectile that are not affected by damage falloff (deals 50 damage at all ranges). \+ Faster projectile speed. (Also they should really give this thing a 3rd person reload animation it lacks.) &amp;#x200B; * **The Short Circuit:** This one will be short and sweet: lets remove the Primary Fire zap and put the Energy Ball as the Primary fire instead. But let's also reduce the spammability of this weapon: \+ Each Energy Ball costs 50 metal (instead of 65 metal). \- No longer gain metal from Dispensers (includes carts as well) when active. \- Cannot fire an Energy Ball until the last one runs its course (so only one at a time). So the weapon is now slightly more confortable to use, with its tweaked controls and lower metal cost, but is less spammable with its slower firing speed and the fact you can't camp a dispenser and spam Energy Balls or delete all projectiles that dare come close to the cart. &amp;#x200B; * **The Shortstop:** The ""shove"" on this is quite useless and can't quite revert it to its base stats because Scout will be even more selfish, plus the extra knockback vulnerability is a non-downside, these stats must go away, but let's keep the tight spread and 4 ammo clip that recharges in one go. As such, I decided this should be a quickdraw type weapon as suggested by its description and the real-life weapon its based after: \+ 65% faster deploying time. \+ When Scout uses his secondary or melee properly ( when he deals 75 damage with his pistol, hits people with a bat, a cleaver, a ball, coats someone in Mad Milk or if he takes 75 damage under the effects of Bonk), he gains ""Confidence"", allowing his next shot within 5 seconds of deploying the weapon to do a mini-crit. \- Missing the mini-crit shot will slow him down for 5 seconds. \- Scout will get Marked-For-Death when he deploys the gun with ""Confidence"" for 5 seconds, the effect will go away early if he hits the first shot. \- -20% carried ammo for your secondary (will only affect pistols). \- 20% slower recharge time of items (will affect Mad Milk, Flying Guillotine, Bonk, Crit-A-Cola, Sandman and Wrap Assassin). This weapon now allows Scout to dominate duels just as long as he gives himself an advantage. &amp;#x200B; * **The Enforcer:** The weapon not only suffers from stiff competition with the likes of The Diamondback and L'tranger, but also from weak upsides it has. We'll remove its current set of upsides and the ""No random crits"" stat and replace them with a more potent set of stats: \+ When shooting out of a disguise, the weapon will deal double damage and ignore bullet resistance. \+ Killing an enemy with this weapon will give Spy a stack of ""Betrayal"" which reduces the time it takes to disguise by 0.5 seconds (stacks up to 5 times for a disguise time of 0.5 seconds). \- If the empowered shot misses, you get Market-For-Death for 6 seconds. \- 33% slower base disguise time (3 seconds). \- Switching disguises will take the same time time as equipping a new disguise. This new Enforcer is more potent at doing what it was supposed to do: dispose faster of targets that either can't be Backstabbed or found out you were a Spy with a new gimmick that revolves about the disguises this weapons rely on, it's also a punishing weapon if you wiff. &amp;#x200B; Feedback, as always, is encouraged."

As this was intended to be the next part of [my post on the primaries](URL all these changes were made in the context of the changes in that post. As such, I have a summary of my afterburn rework from that post included here. **\*\*\*\*\*TL;DR\*\*\*\*\*** |Attacks from any fire-based weapons increases victims' 'temperature', which in turn causes them to catch fire (except Pyros) and increases the amount of damage they take from flamethrowers| |:-| |Afterburn now has 5 tiers, which are governed by the victim's temperature (shown below)| | Tier 1: 4 DPS, 0-20% temp (Flamethrowers, Dragon's Fury, Scorch Shot explosion) | | Tier 2: 6 DPS, 20-40% temp (direct hits w/any flare gun, Detonator explosion)| | Tier 3: 8 DPS, 40-60% temp (Volcano Fragment) | | Tier 4: 10 DPS, 60-80% temp (Gas Passer) | | Tier 5: 12 DPS, 80-100% temp (nothing inflicts this buy default) | |Temperature drops at 10%/second after a second of not taking fire damage (excluding afterburn), and you stop burning when your temperature reaches 0| **\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*** There is a TL;DR at the bottom of this post as well. Feel free to skip my explanations if you want. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ # Secondaries **All Flare guns** (+) Reload time reduced by 20% (-) No random crits (\~) Add a line of text to the description saying ""Fires arcing projectiles that ignite enemies on impact"" \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Reserve Shooter** Removed from Pyro entirely and replaced with the new, Pyro-exclusive shotty below &amp;#x200B; &gt;Explanation: This weapon pales in comparison to the other shotguns on Pyro when stripped of the ability to combo with airblast, but I can't find a way to implement the mini-crits on airblast in a balanced manner that doesn't inadvertently ruin the weapon for Soldier. As such, I think splitting the weapon into 2 is the best choice. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **The Hotshot** *Level 5 Shotgun* (+) 25% more accurate (+) On hit: increases target's current temperature by 50% (does not stack if multiple pellets hit) (+) Deals 15% more damage per victim's tier of afterburn (-) 35% damage penalty (-) -50% clip size (\~) Pellets produce bright orange trails and release a flame particle effect on impact (purely cosmetic feature) &amp;#x200B; &gt;Explanation: This weapon is designed to be a hitscan finisher weapon that excels at killing burning targets trying to run away. The extra damage on burning enemies helps finish weaker enemies off while the increased temperature on hit forces tougher enemies to either disengage and seek healing or take loads of extended-duration burn damage. The tradeoff is considerably reduced performance in drawn-out fights compared to the shotgun. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Gas Passer** *Goal: Make the weapon less of an unsatisfying piece of garbage* (+) Time taken to charge reduced to 40 seconds, and damage needed to charge reduced to 500 (+) Damage from reflects and extinguishing teammates both contribute to charging the weapon (charge from extinguishes is proportional to the afterburn tier of the teammate before extinguishing them) (+) Enemies covered in gas have their temperature reduced half as quickly (both by time and by healers), and have their temperature raised instantly to 75% (tier 4 afterburn) upon taking damage * The debuff lasts 10 seconds and unlike now, is not removed when the target is ignited (+) When a burning enemy touches the gas or a gassed enemy recieves fire damage, The gas debuff is removed and the target instantly suffers 50 explosive damage (like the MvM ability but weaker) and has their temperature raised to 100% &amp;#x200B; (=) The gas cloud starts off extremely small, and expands to 150% of its current volume (perhaps even taking the shape of the space its in) over 1 second (-) Charge does not persist through death (-) The gas cloud does not extinguish teammates &amp;#x200B; (\~) The weapon has its own kill icon (currently it just uses the stock flamethrower's) (\~) The weapon charges at 4x speed during setup (-) Gas clouds are now slightly team-coloured, and friendly ones are considerably less opaque &amp;#x200B; &gt;*Explanation: A weapon that takes forever to charge and inflicts the worst debuff in the game is far from being a viable secondary option for a class that relies on its secondary more than anyone else except Demo or Medic. On top of that, the weapon's effectiveness is dependent mostly on your teammates as you yourself benefit little from the gas debuff, making it rather unsatisfying to use as well.* &gt; &gt;*To remedy this, I made the weapon charge faster (especially for defensive support Pybro players) and made it scarier to get hit by. The Pyro themself also has ways of capitalising on the gas effect during a fight. You could douse some people before burning them for a considerable damage boost, or you could use the gas to cover your enemies' escape, forcing them to stay within your range. You could even airblast burning players into the gas to finish them off.* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Gas Passer - MvM** *Goal: Make the weapon less overpowered and game-breaking* (=) 'Explode on ignite' replaced with the following 2 upgrades: * Napalm canister * 1 tick; $400 * The gas cloud slows enemies down and damages them on contact (and changes the cloud's visual to a napalm carpet) * Cloud duration * 3 ticks; $250 * Increases the duration of the gas cloud by 2.5 seconds (-) Recharge speed upgrades removed entirely \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Manmelter** *Goal: Redesign the weapon into a mid-range damage tool* Wipe all stats (+) 1 second reload time (+) On hit: deals bonus damage based on the victim's current afterburn tier, and then increases it by 1 * This is accompanied by increasingly intense visuals and sound effects depending on afterburn tier (+) Does not require ammo (=) No projectile arc (-) 80% damage penalty vs buildings (\~) The weapon has an actual reload animation depicting particles swirling into the 'barrel' \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Detonator** (+) Alt-fire without any flares deployed: detonate the currently-loaded flare, launching yourself backwards (+) Self damage from blast jumping reduced by 35% (\~) Detonator flares and the explosions they produce are more visually distinct from the other flare guns \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Scorch Shot** *Goal: Make the weapon less of a spam tool and slightly better in direct combat* (+) Damage penalty reduced to 20% (from 33%) (+) Self knockback penalty removed (=) Knockback works the same way as rocket knockback, rather than being a stunlock (a la the old airblast) (-) Projectile speed reduced by 25% (-) The explosion only inflicts tier 1 afterburn for 2 seconds (\~) Add ""explosion destroys enemy stickybombs"" to the description (\~) In Pyroland, the flare creates a trail of bubbles &amp;#x200B; &gt;Explanation: While this weapon isn't really OP, many find it annoying to deal with due to its afterburn combined with how easily spammable it is. I attempted to make the weapon more similar to the rocket launcher - a slower, more powerful projectile that launches enemies around - in an attempt to distinguish it from the Detonator as many feel that the Scorch is little more than a crutch for those inexperienced with the Det in its current state. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Thermal Thruster** *Goal: Make the weapon more useful in combat situations to justify the cost of losing a ranged weapon* (+) Press space while in the air to preform a short dash in the direction of the crosshair * The dash generates a similar amount of height and distance to a FaN jump * The dash uses 1 charge * It can be used even when the weapon is not deployed (+) Increased knockback on wearer only applies when using either of the jump abilities (+) The user has greatly increased air control when using a jump ability with the jetpack held out (+) The 'ground slam' does damage depending on the height you fall from (up to 35 damage when falling from the top of Hightower's tower and landing right next to an enemy), and launches enemies up rather than backwards (+) Draw and holster time both reduced to 0.75 seconds (\~) The weapon has its own kill icon \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ # Melees **Powerjack** *Goal: Prevent it completely overshadowing the other melees* (-) Health on kill removed (-) &lt;Maybe&gt; Damage vulnerability while active replaced with passive 10% bullet damage vulnerability (like the pain train) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Homewrecker** *Goal: Make this weapon more useful on offense* (+) On hit: stuns buildings for 0.7 seconds (+) 75% knockback resistance on wearer while active (=) Damage penalty replaced with 50% slower swing speed (-) Damage bonus vs buildings reduced to +40% (91/hit) &amp;#x200B; &gt;*Explanation: The primary goal here is to make it easier for Pyro to approach sentries. The combination of stun and knockback resistance allows you to quickly get within range of sentries that are around corners, in their redeploy animation or distracted by teammates, and stall them long enough for you or somebody else to finish them off. The knockback resistance also gives the weapon some use in general combat or during Pyro ubers (and kind of makes sense since sledgehammers are heavy).* &gt; &gt;*Part of the reason I reduced the anti-building damage to 91 and reduced the swing speed was to make it less of an anti-Spy weapon. I'm fine with it being able to remove sappers, but not with it being able to remove sappers faster than the Engie himself.* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Sharpened Volcano Fragment** *Goal: Give the weapon its own niche* (+) Eruption: on kill, the victim's body explodes violently, dealing damage equal to 33% of their max HP and raising enemies' temperature to 60% (tier 3 afterburn) * If an eruption kills another enemy, their death will also trigger an eruption (+) &lt;Maybe&gt; Mini-crits burning enemies (+) Now performs the Rainblower's taunt (Armageddon) (=) Damage penalty increased to -65%, but only applies vs non-burning players (\~) When in Pyroland, enemies killed by eruptions explode into showers of candy (for the lolz) &amp;#x200B; &gt;*Explanation: This idea was inspired partially by the Axtinguisher, but while the Ax is intended for dealing with one specific guy, this weapon is intended for dealing with many. You can light a few people up with your primary, kill one guy with the SVF and have the eruption finish off the rest. The afterburn on hit is still there, so you can use this in Degroot as a crowd-control weapon.* &gt; &gt;*This may not necessarily be the most viable of concepts, but I think it's a fun and unique gimmick that's better than the weapon we have now.* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **\*\*\*\*\*TL;DR\*\*\*\*\*** |Flare guns reload 10% faster but don't randomly crit| |:-| |The Reserve Shooter has been removed from Pyro and replaced with 'The Hotshot', which fuctions somewhat like a Shotgun-Flare hybrid that excels at finishing enemies that try to run away| |The Gas Passer charges faster, is more powerful, and has a weaker version of the MvM upgrade explosion that occurs whenever a gassed opponent takes fire damage (or vice versa), allowing the Pyro themself to combo their own weapons with the gas| |Explode on ignite is gone from MvM and replaced with a napalm carpet upgrade; recharge speed upgrades have been replaced with increased cloud duration upgrades| |The Manmelter is now a midrange DPS tool that rewards consecutive hits with bonus damage and stronger afterburn| |The Scorch Shot is worse at spam and functions a little more like the TFC Incendiary Cannon| |The Thermal Thruster grants a passive pseudo-double jump ability, and is slightly better overall| |The Powerjack doesn't heal on kill| |The Homewrecker is worse at removing sappers but grants knockback reduction when held and temporarily stuns buildings on hit| |The Volcano Fragment causes explosions on kill and has the Rainblower's killtaunt| **\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Thanks for reading and I hope you liked it :)"

This is going to go over everything I'd personally do to make Heavy more fun, including balance changes and new weapons. &amp;#x200B; # Heavy Balance Changes General: \-Heavy now has a 4th slot for 'lunchbox' items. This allows Heavies to have access to both their shotgun and sandvich, without having to sacrifice either one. \--This change is because Heavies tend to never use Shotguns ever, with how powerful and useful lunchbox items are. \--The stock item for this slot is a new weapon, ""The Ammo Reserv,"" to allow Sandviches to keep being an unlockable weapon. \-Spin down time decreased, on all miniguns. \--Taking time to spin up a minigun is necessary due to its power, but spinning down shouldn't also be slow, as you're obviously not able to keep firing after you spin down. \-The Heavy is now able to jump while spun up, but with a much lower height than usual, and move while crouched, albeit at minimum speed. \--These changes allow the Heavy to have a lot more movement options without having to stop firing, allowing for more effective dodging, especially of enemy Snipers. Weapons: Natascha's new stats- \+Dealing damage builds up rage, pressing the reload key while rage meter is full allows you to push enemies away from you. \+20% more accurate \-20% slower firing speed \--These new stats allow Heavy to use a previously MvM-exclusive ability to knockback opponents. The previous slowing effect of this gun was very annoying to play against, and allowed Heavies to beat Scouts trying to run away with very little skill or effort. \--Due to damage fall-off and bullet spread, knocking an opponent away would usually result in significantly less damage, so the Natascha has more accuracy to retain some damage at farther ranges. Brass Beast's new stats- \+Firing speed increases as wielder stays revved up, up to 20% faster over the course of 15 seconds. \+20% damage bonus \-20% slower firing speed \-Wielder is pushed back in the opposite direction they're firing, pushback is increased as firing speed increases \--The old stats were incredibly boring to use, making the Heavy practically stationary in exchange for relatively weak upsides. The new stats allow the Heavy to be the insane DPS powerhouse the weapon was meant to be, without forcing you to stay in one place the entire time. \--The pushback force prevents the Heavy from walking forward at all while he's firing, but can also be used to move slightly faster than normal by shooting away from the opponents. Note that the maximum speed achievable with this is only slightly faster than Heavy's default speed, but allows him to stay revved up while moving. Tomislav's new stats- \+20% faster spin-up time \+20% switch-from speed \+Can switch to other weapons while spun-up \+Silent Killer: No spin-up sound \-20% firing speed \--The previous Tomislav was good, but due to the accuracy buff keeping damage per second relatively unchanged at mid-range, it was too similar to the stock Minigun. These new stats keep the spirit of the old Tomislav but make it solidly different from stock. Huo-Long Heater- \+Ring of fire range is increased in radius and height, preventing spies from getting a backstab without being ignited. \+Ring of fire damage increased \+Ammo drain is reduced to 3 per second \--The ring of fire in practice doesn't really do much, since it's so small and unthreatening. For the massive downside of losing significantly more ammo per second, it's just not worth it. These small buffs keep the stats pretty much the same, but massively benefit its usability. Dalokohs Bar- \+Healing increased to 200, duration of extra max health extended to 1 minute, and drops a medium health pack. \-Recharge time decreased to 30 seconds. \--The previous stats were underwhelming and overshadowed by the Second Banana. These new stats make it unnecessary to eat it so often to keep your extra health, but the recharge time was lowered to compensate. Buffalo Steak Sandvich's new stats- \+On consumption: Gain melee mini-crits and 35% faster movement speed, but 20% damage vulnerability for 20 seconds \-50% less healing \--The lack of healing and the inability to use your minigun made this weapon too risky to use for most situations. # New Weapons! # The Ammo Reserv \*Drops a medium ammo pack instead of health kit \+Refills Heavy's ammo completely on use \+Allows you to see the ammo and metal of teammates \-66% less healing \*Shoutouts to Uncle Dane # The Molotov Cocktail \*Replaces the shotgun with a throwable Molotov Cocktail similar to the Jarate that ignites enemy players. \+On hit: creates a large damaging explosion if the enemy is holding any weapon that fires explosives. Also empties the enemy's loaded ammo and safely detonates Demoman's sticky bombs if it succeeds. # The Means of Produkshun \*Replaces the minigun with a backpack that can't be used as a weapon. \+50% faster recharge rate on all lunchbox items \+Health gained from thrown food can overheal at half effectiveness \-50 max health on wearer &amp;#x200B; thats it thanks and have fun after 9 years in development, hopefully the heavy update will be worth the wait."

So I figured, why not throw my hat into the ring? This is my idea for a Heavy Update, but it also serves as a Winter/Smissmas Update. It would come with Five New Weapons, 2 New Maps, 2 Community Maps, New Cosmetics, Minor Gameplay Changes, Balance Changes, and more. # Backstory A new cache of Australium has been unearthed from a mountain within a Siberian Ski Resort! Upon hearing about this, Saxton Hale hires the newly-reassembled RED Team to obtain the deposit for Mann Co. At the same time, the Administrator brings the BLU Team back together to obtain the Australium for herself. # Weapons **RIOT SHIELD:** Primary Weapon for Heavy. A Big Plastic Shield that unlocks a unique alternate playstyle for Heavy. * Move 10% Faster while holding this. * Block all Non-Explosive Damage from the front. * Block 50% of all Explosive Damage from the front. * While Equipped: 25 Less Max Health * While Deployed: 10% Faster Movement Speed * Alt-Fire to take a couple quick steps forward, then bash enemies with the Shield. * Shield Bash is a Stock Melee Attack with a Shortstop Shove Effect and a chance to Random Crit. * Has a hidden 3-second cooldown before it can be used again * Dual-Wielded with your Secondary if it is a Shotgun **RAIDING AID:** Secondary Weapon for Heavy, Pyro, and Soldier. Primary Weapon for Engineer. [Workshop Page here.](URL * See [here](URL for stats **AMMO RESERV:** Secondary Weapon for Heavy. Taken from one of Uncle Dane's weapon ideas videos. Go find it there or on Karma Charger's channel, I'm too lazy to scour YouTube for it. **CRUSHCHEV:** Melee Weapon for Heavy. Is a giant, two-handed hammer. Name is a pun on the name of former Soviet Leader Nikita Khrushchev. * Does 40% More Damage * Alt-Fire is a slower Overhead swing that hits directly in front of Heavy, but is a guaranteed Critical Hit * 15% Slower Swing Speed * While Deployed: Move 7% Slower * 15% Slower Deploy Speed * No random crits **TOKAMAK:** Primary Weapon for Heavy. Fires Lasers instead of Bullets, but is still hitscan. [Workshop Page here.](URL * Projectiles pierce enemies * Consumes no ammo; Uses an Ammo Meter that automatically recharges over time instead * Hold Reload to charge a single powerful shot * While holding Reload, ammo is consumed, but nothing is fired. When Reload is released, a single bullet will be fired straight forward with the combined power of the number of rounds that were consumed in charging the shot. * The charge will stop consuming ammo and remain at the same power after a sixth of the ammo meter (25 Rounds) is consumed. * Firing a Charge Shot resets Bullet Spread. * 15% Less Damage * 25% Less Max Ammo * Mini-Crits when it would normally crit * Enemies suffer a distinctive death by incineration # New Maps **ALPINE (Special Delivery):** A map set in the Siberian Ski Resort mentioned in the update backstory. A fairly large map with a Ski Lift snaking through the center of it. A platform is attached to said Ski Lift, and it must be ridden all the way to the Helicopter at the end by the team with control of the Australium. Unlike Doomsday's Rocket, the Ski Lift moves in a horizontal path. **OLD NICK'S WORKSHOP (Player Destruction):** A map set in a small snowy village. The goal of players is to kill enemies to receive presents, which replace Watergate's Beer Bottles. They then must be brought to Old Nick's Sleigh, which passes through the map every few minutes, replacing Watergate's UFO. The map comes with new voice lines for Old Nick. # Community Maps * [Frostfell (Payload Race)](URL * [Stoneridge (Attack/Defend)](URL # Gameplay Changes * **Saxton Hale** has new voice lines, and now serves as the announcer for the RED Team in all modes except for Mann VS. Machine. * The rules of **Capture the Flag** have been overhauled. * After 15 Minutes, the team with the most captures wins. * If there is a tie after 15 Minutes, the game goes into ""Sudden Death,"" and the next capture wins the game. * **Player Destruction** and **Special Delivery** are no longer considered Alternative Gamemodes. # Balance Changes/Weapon Reworks * **Blutsauger** (REWORKED) * New Stats * While Deployed: Automatic Health Regen is disabled * On hit: Cover enemies in Milk * Does 20% Less Damage * Why? * This is meant to make the Blutsauger more of a team-based weapon by allowing your teammates to get in on the Health Regeneration it gives, but lessening the damage output of the weapon at the same time. * **Fists of Steel** * Now holsters 50% Slower (From 100%) * Now take 50% Less Damage from Ranged Sources (From 40%) * **Darwin's Danger Shield** * New Stats * \+25% Bullet Resistance on Wearer * \+15% Explosive Vulnerability on Wearer * Why? * At the moment, the Darwin's Danger Shield does not do much for Snipers other than assist them when fighting Pyro, a class that Sniper doesn't face very frequently in a 1v1 Situation. * This change gives the Danger Shield back its Bullet Resistance, making it a bit more versatile, but at the same time gives it a clear disadvantage against Soldier and Demoman. * **Cleaner's Carbine** * Now has a 15% Slower Firing Speed (From 25%) * **Shahanshah** * Damage done now scales linearly with Health remaining. * **Vita-Saw** * Now has the Spinal Tap kill taunt. * Rather than filling ber instantly, it maxes out Organs. * **Third Degree** (REWORKED) * New Stats * Damage transfers to all players/buildings connected by Dispenser beams, Medic beams, or Soldier banners. * {HIDDEN} When a crit transfers to another player/building, it will downgrade to a Mini-Crit, then to regular damage after another transfer. * {HIDDEN} When an attack transfers to a Soldier/Dispenser, it will then transfer to all other players connected to them * {HIDDEN} Damage can transfer amongst any kind of support beam, regardless of starting point * Store a crit for every 500 Afterburn Damage done. * 10% Less Damage * 5% Slower Swing Speed * New Killicon for anyone killed by transferred damage * Why? * To give people a reason to use the Third Degree. * **Soldier's Banners** * Now have a beam graphic connecting anyone under their effects to the Soldier using the banner. * This beam is invisible if attached to a cloaked or disguised Spy. # Cosmetics * **What's Cooking** * All-Class Chef's Hat * Paintable * **Mind Fuzz** * Pyro Head Replacement * Turns Pyro's Head into a Snowglobe * **Slope Freak** * Scout Backpack * Places Team-Colored Skis and Poles on Scout's back * Paintable # Conclusion Yikes, that was a long thread. I'll add more stuff if I think of more stuff. Until then, peace."

The Quick-Fix is not allowed in competitive 6v6, and after looking at several Reddit posts and A Woolen Slevelets video, I understand why. The Quick-Fixs faster healing rate, the powerful bercharge, and the fact you can match any classs speed make this weapon incredible in the right hands. While having less overheal sucks, the benefits this weapon grants are godly. I decided that the best way to balance this weapon would be split to split the Quick-Fix into two weapons Equaliser style. Im still teetering on the specific stats, as well as the name of the new Medigun, so if you have a better suggestion, please say it. New Quick-Fix: (=) berCharge increases healing by 300%, but marks your patent for death. (+) +40% heal rate (+) +15% berCharge rate (+) No bercharge time is lost when switching patients (-) The Healing Patient receives a 10% damage vulnerability while being healed. (-) -50% max overheal rate Now I dont expect this Medigun to be the most balanced idea in the world, but the Medigun is the hardest weapon to balance because of how game-changing they can be. Nevertheless, I will explain my decisions. * I decided to make the Quick-Fixs bercharge a tool to heal everybody, rather than push through chokepoints quickly. To accomplish this, I added the marked for death statistic rather than decreasing the bercharge heal rate. * To counterbalance the change to the bercharge, I added the No bercharge lost when switching patients statistic, also encouraging medics to spread the healing around. * I left the healing rate alone because I didnt want to nerf the weapon too hard. Instead, I opted to go a similar route with the bercharge, where the heal target would receive a damage vulnerability, but would still receive rapid healing. The Shock Therapist (Speed Medigun): (=) berCharge increases the targets speed by 35%, and grants immunity to movement-impairing effects for 5 seconds. (+) Requires 50% of bercharge to activate (+) 10% faster bercharge rate (+) Heal patient gains a 10% faster move speed. (+) Mirrors blast jumps &amp; speed boosts granted by weapons(example: Babyface blaster, Powerjack) (+) 200% air control and fall damage immunity while the weapon is active (-) -50% Critical heal rate Once again, I dont expect this Medigun to be the most balanced idea in the world, and I will explain my reasoning. A brief disclaimer before I do, I tried my best to make this weapon make playing medic much more fast-paced and exhilarating, and allow him to be wherever he needs to be. * I added the 200% air control and fall damage immunity from the Manntreads to make it easier to control where you are trying to go when blast jumping. * I added the critical heal rate penalty to encourage the medic and his team to be proactive when, and not sitting in a corner waiting for critical heals to build up. Besides, the Medigun needed a downside to counteract the upsides. * I initially thought that extra speed for 8 seconds would be excellent, but I dont think it could hold a candle to the other Mediguns. Thats why I changed bercharge to be available much faster than the alternatives (except the Vaccinator). Thats my idea. If you think that this idea is trash, please tell me why so I can make the concept of it better."

But now you're taking a risk to gain a reward, that goes with it's bonus. The weapon makes sense.* *A max of one health kit can be spawned at a time. If you strike a killing blow while there is already another spawned pack ont he field the oldest one will start flicker and will disappear in (0-5) seconds. The spawned pack will passively despawn in 30 seconds.* # Reserve Shooter * \[removed\]**~~Mini-crits targets launched airborne by explosions, grapple hooks or rocket packs~~** * \[added\]**Fires an accurate slug round, best against slow-moving or immobile targets** * \[removed\]**~~+20% deploy speed~~** * \[added\]**+25% switch speed (on &amp; off)** * **-34% clip size** *The reserve shooter was decent on Pyro before the JI nerf, but was already sub-par on soldier. Banned in most comp leageus not used in PUBs. So first making it an all-class shotgun and keeping the same niche and removing the gimmick should make it way more realistic to balance in tandem with other shotguns.* *It has more base range, its quicker, more accurate and viable than it originally was which makes it far feasible as a side-grade and to use.* # Pomson 6000 * **Does not require ammo** * \[removed\]**~~Projectile cannot be deflected~~** **^(hit-scan now so this is unneeded text)** * \[removed\]**~~On Hit: Victim loses up to 10% Medigun charge~~** * \[removed\]**~~On Hit: Victim loses up to 20% cloak~~** * \[removed\]**~~Deals only 20% damage to buildings~~** * \[added\]**Fires a constant beam of energy similar to the flamethowers (does not apply afterburn or fire effects)** * \[added\]**Can overheat** *This is essentially an easier shotgun for new or bad players players (balanced with less potential damage). And hopefully an all class weapon, replacing the Righteous Bison when on Soldier.* *FIring this weapon without hitting anything for 0.5 seconds causes an effect ""extra-heating"" making the weapon overheat faster and lose heat slower. Being in combat easily refreshes this buff. (This is a change I'm considering to mitigate Spy Checking)* `Another rework of this weapon could be turning it into a semi-automatic charge weapon that functions similar to a base shotgun, but can be fully charged to fire the first round as one accurate long range beam-shot. The charged shot can be held while holstered, with only three bullets total in the magazine. Maybe a rework for the Panic Attack?` # Vita-Saw * \[removed\]**~~Collect the organs of people you hit~~** * \[added\]**On Death: Drop this saw on the ground if it's retrieved gain up to 20% Ubercharge** * **-10 max health on wearer** **^(unsure of whether or not to remove this)** *Can only be retrieved by the Medic who originally had the exact Vita-Saw dropped, and only if they have the same Medi-Gun that was used during that life.* *Currently the VIta-Saw is an UberSaw copy. Returning it to it's original niche but buffing the risk and buffing the reward in my opinion would put it in good balance. This weapon would need a lot of tweaking to get just right (ex: not letting it charge different Ubers, changing the uber amount gained, maybe it has to be equipped when you die. There's a lot of small changes that can be made to a weapon like this).* I have a lot more ideas big and small, and would love to hear anyone else's. Feel free to reply."

(+) Secondary Fire allows user to block, reducing damage and allowing user to increase their melee/projectile damage. * Press R while weapon is active to switch to a projectile attack. It is a tiny fireball that deals little damage (25) at first, but inflicts afterburn for 5 seconds. * Blocking isnt just a simple Right click and win mechanic. Once you click m2, you will block for a short period of time; after a very short period of blocking (0.35s), if you dont block any damage then you are forced to go through a 0.6s cooldown where you cant block or switch weapons. * If you block an attack, then you can block again after 0.3s or switch weapons. The main benefit of blocking, however, is that you can increase you melee/projectile damage while taking less damage from blocked attacks. * All attacks that are block have their damage values reduced by 80%. Melee damage can be increased to +100% (130) via blocking. Projectile damage is also increased via blocking, up to 300% (75) but projectile usage drains the meter. * User need to block 300 damage total to gain the full benefits. User (and enemies) will know users are blocking correctly by a distinct sound effect. Gloves also catch fire and grow in intensity as user blocks more damage. * Blocking only blocks damage from the front. You cant block splash damage from behind or backstabs for example. * Bonuses gained from blocking are only in effect when weapon is active.

(Hidden stat) ***** This rework is designed to make the weapon less situational and allowing for a risk/reward playstyle that rewards skillful players that block correctly with reduce damage taken, more melee damage, and move projectile damage. Boxing heavies that perfect the art of blocking and managing their projectile usage can become a formidable foe on the battlefield. By giving melee heavies a range option(you know, besides a shotgun or minigun), it should make pure boxing heavies a bit more versatile in more open areas of a map where previously the playstyle was easily countered. The projectile also allows the heavy to work together with a pyro and obtain kills though comboing different unlocks from each respective class. The Buffalo Steak Sandvich is still a viable item to use with this weapon; even more so, since the blocking mechanic can override the damage vulnerability of the BSS if the player is skillful enough to land blocks effectively. **** However, splash damage, spies, and fast firing weapons are the bane of this weapon and are effective counters. You can block splash damage, but not if it's dealt behind you so position is key. Backstabs can never be blocked, but you can set fleeing spies alight. Fast firing weapons (flame flamethrowers, miniguns, ect) can easily be blocked to gain the bonuses to melee and projectile damage, but you will take normal damage after blocking due to the cooldown that occurs after use. Either kill the enemy while you deal more damage or flee."

Please leave a comment if you have any better ideas or if there's an item you think should be here. *Warning: long post* \*\*\*\*\* # Primaries **Force-a-Nature** *Goal: stop the knockback getting in the way of damage output, but without flat-out nerfing the knockback* (=) Shots do 50% knockback against targets on the ground, but 125% knockback on targets knocked into the air &amp;#x200B; *Explanation: The idea here is that your first shot doesn't knock the target back as far, so that they take more damage from your second shot. This makes 2-round bursts more powerful, while keeping the weapon's ability to knock people back if that's what you want to use it for.* \*\*\*\*\* **Baby Face's Blaster** *Goal: make the boost harder to lose in combat* (+) Boost is lost at 25% of the current rate from taking damage (100 damage to drain the whole meter) (+) Boost lost from air jumps reduced to 35% (from 75%) (-) Boost starts to passively drain after 1 second of not dealing damage (drains 20%/sec) (\~) Stats pertaining to loss of boost combined into a single line of text reading ""Boost lost by air jumping, taking damage or over time"" (to free up some space in the description) \*\*\*\*\* **Back Scatter** *Goal: remove one of the downsides to make the weapon less of a burden to the Scout* (+) Accuracy penalty removed \*\*\*\*\* **Shortstop** *Goal: tweak the stats so that the weapon becomes stronger and less sluggish* (+) Base damage increased by 25% (does 60 damage per shot at mid range, up from 48) (+) Reload time reduced by 33% (1 second reloads) (+) Shove reach increased by 35% (this would put it somewhere between bat range and eyelander range) (+) Shove strength works more like airblast, in that enemies running into the Scout (like wm1 Pyros) get pushed further, and the Scout can push enemies more upwards by aiming the shove at their heads (-) Max ramp up reduced to 130% (the weapon does 80 damage point blank, which is actually a buff compared to now) (\~) Change the shove animation to be more forceful (and possibly also the reload animation) &amp;#x200B; *Explanation: I'm not entirely sure why the weapon is so mediocre, but I suspect it's because the damage fails to cross several HP thresholds that other primaries do. The current shorty (my nickname for it) takes 3 shots to kill a Medic even at point blank and an entire clip at mid range. In fact, missing more than 1 pellet on a light class at mid-range forces you to expend your entire clip to kill them.* *When deciding what the shorty's damage range should be changed to, I wanted it to be able to 3-shot Medics (and consistently 3-shot light classes) at mid-range (hence 60 base damage). I played with the ramp up so that it gave a slight buff at close range (and allow you to 2-shot Medics if you get into melee range) without allowing you to 2-shot Demos and Pyros. I've also buffed the shove a bit so that it might be useful for keeping Pyros/Demoknights/other Scouts away.* \*\*\*\*\* # Secondaries **Crit-a-Cola** *Goal: make it a little harder for good players to abuse* (=) The Scout is now marked for death for the entire duration of the drink plus 2 seconds, rather than only whenever he shoots (-) The Scout cannot be overhealed while under the effects, and rapidly loses overheal while drinking (this wouldn't effect money overheal in MvM) (+) Melees do full crits under the effects instead of mincrits (for messing around in pubs) \*\*\*\*\* **Bonk! Atomic Punch** *Goal: replace the Jungle Inferno change with one I think will be better* (=) Rather than be slowed when the effect wears off, Scout will be slowed *while* taking damage (and 1 second after) (strength of slow still depends of the amount of damage taken) (+) Scout can switch weapons while under the effects (+) Scout takes no knockback from sentry guns while under the effects &amp;#x200B; *Explanation: This change aims to introduce some more counterplay to the bonk by allowing enemies to directly hinder the Scout, while also hopefully making it better at its job, since there is no slowdown during the effect. However, the weapon would still be rather situational.* \*\*\*\*\* **Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol** *Goal: bring the weapon a little more in line with stock* (+) 15% damage penalty \*\*\*\*\* **Mad Milk** *Goal: make the weapon harder to make effective use of, to compensate for its strength* (+) When extinguishing teammates, cooldown reduced by 20% for *each* teammate extinguished (-) Cooldown starts empty and is not affected by resupply (-) Splash radius reduced by 20% \*\*\*\*\* **Flying Guillotine** *Goal: reduce spaminess and give the weapon its own role to fill* (+) On kill: next cleaver recharges 4 seconds faster (+) Crits 'confused' players (see sandman changes below) (-) Recharge time increased to 8 seconds (-) Recharge time no longer reduced on long-range hits (-) Base damage reduced to 40 (=) Has 25% damage ramp up and 25% damage fall off (damage varies from 50 - 30 based on range) &amp;#x200B; *Explanation: The 'role' I have in mind is an execution weapon, like the axtinguisher. You throw cleavers at people your team damages (or people you have softened up with your primary) and get rewarded for finishing someone off with a faster recharge. I think it would pair well with the 2-shot primaries, so you have a way of quickly finishing people who survive your 2-round burst. The damage and charge reductions prevent the weapon being able to compete with the pistol in terms of pure DPS, as a mid-range spam weapon is not something Scout should have.* \*\*\*\*\* # Melees **Sandman** *Goal: make the weapon more impactful (but less annoying than the pre-JI version)* (=) Slow effect replaced with the 'confused' debuff that scrambles players' WASD keys temporarily and causes bots to stumble around (+) Mini-crits confused players (-) Ball damage and recharge time changed to pre-JI values (damage reduced by 33%, recharge increased by 50%) &amp;#x200B; *Explanation: You may remember this idea from* [another post of mine](URL Because I imagined it would be controversial, and because it was one of the first ideas I came up with for this post, I published it separately to see what the community's opinion was so that I could tweak it before putting it in here.

Perhaps this kind of idea can be reworked into something vastly more versatile. In order to not stack effects, we'll be tossing out the heal reduction stat to make way for something that accomplishes the same thing and more. ~~**Afterburn now gives victims a small but noticeable damage vulnerability to every damage type except fire**~~ One thing that Pyros can already (kind of) do is to cause havoc when the enemy is grouped up around the objective, so if the Pyro has that much more ability to assist its team's damage without drastically improving its 1 on 1 potential, then Pyro's overall strength is increased without making anyone feel that their death to fire was particularly unfair. Think of it like how Sniper can help increase the team's damage with Jarate, except the flamethrower would be able to do it vastly more consistently. To keep things a bit in check, I think it would make sense to bring down direct flame damage a tad. Not sure if pre-JI flame damage would be best, but either way, a reduction compared to now. In addition to the change mentioned above, I think another thing that could help afterburn to feel a bit less pitiful would be to take the healing reduction in a slightly different way. ~~**Afterburn now gives victims a slight restoration reduction from health packs**~~ With how many different ways fire can be extinguished nowadays, perhaps it's time to give a slight nerf to the OG way to extinguish yourself. It would become much less likely that getting to a health pack would put you back in fighting shape in spite of just recently having been on the brink of death, meaning that, at worst, enemies would have to stall for that much longer looking for more health, and at best, could give your teammates a better chance of finishing what you started. In conclusion, I think that these changes could seriously help Pyro to not only have a stronger role on the team, but to have a more clearly defined one at that: An Offense-Oriented Support Class."

It's main use and purpose would be debuffing enemies before a big fight and/or use it mid fight as a sort of ""Pull out, shoot once or twice, switch back to medigun"" and this would be the optimal time to counter this weapon, since the Medic's Target would be left without a healer, thus rendering him and his Medic more vulnerable. &amp;#x200B; If the Medic's target isn't under any resistance kind buff, then this would mean he would receive 110% Of damage. This is huge, since now Sandman scouts will die in 1 hit from a Demo's pill, weapons like the Skullcutter would kill Demos and Pyros in 2 hits (Technically they would be left with 2 HP, but if we add the damage of a single, min. damage syringe then they're dead). Of course this is the same for the medic that is using the Pestilence, which means that using it requires precision and coordination with your team. &amp;#x200B; The 15% Damage Penalty would put the Pestilence at the same damage as the Overdose (So 10 Damage per syringe at max), and a firing speed of 1 syringe every .15 seconds (Compared to the Stocks .1, which means that the Stock will empty it's clip in 4 seconds , compared to the Pestilence's 6). &amp;#x200B; The most important stat of the Pestilence is, without a doubt, the 40% decreased healing, which completely nullifies the Quick Fix (Bringing it's HPS to 24 while in combat and 72 when out of combat) and the Stocks' and all the other Medi guns would basically slow to a crawl (Bringing their HPS to 14 while in combat and 42.5 or 43 while out of combat, this means that it takes around 9 full seconds to fully heal up 125 HP, compared to Stock's 5) &amp;#x200B; Overall, The Pestilence would be a viable utility weapon that can compete with the Overdose and Blutsauger in a big team fight scenario. &amp;#x200B; I'd like to hear your thoughts in the comments below."

I also added a new mechanic to most melees to make the class a little more interesting. *Warning: long post* &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* # Primaries **All Miniguns** (+) Minigun accuracy and damage will steadily rise from 50% to 100% over 1 second after revving up, rather than staying at 50% and then jumping straight to 100% as it does now (\~) To indicate this, the pitch of the rev up noise and spin speed of the barrel will start low, and gradually increase to normal over 1 second &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* **Natascha** *Goal: Make the weapon more fun for both parties* (=) Slowdown replaced with 'On hit: gain a 1 second speed boost based on distance to target' * Boost strength varies from +75% at point blank to +40% at 512 Hu to +0% at 1024 Hu * The point blank boost makes Heavy a touch slower than his base running speed, and the midrange boost makes him as fast as when being whipped by a Soldier (=) Damage resistance and slower spin up time removed &amp;#x200B; *Explanation: Natascha was very much a failure from Valve when first added: it was designed do do something Heavy didn't need (catching fleeing enemies), wasn't even very good at doing that, and simply proved to be unfun for both user (low damage) and victim (slowdown). This design fulfills Valve's goals for the original weapon, but in a more fun way. The speedboost makes the weapon particularly effective at pushing, as it allows you to advance faster, but at the cost of Sasha's raw DPS.* &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* **Brass Beast** *Goal: Buff the weapon all around, while tweaking the penalties to allow for more offensive use* (+) Speed penalty only applies when firing (not when deployed without firing) (+) 75% knockback resistance while firing (=) Damage buff changed to '+20% faster firing speed' (=) Damage resistance applies regardless of health, but only when firing (-) 50% max overheal penalty while spun up (max 375 HP, giving an effective 450 HP when combined with the resistance) &amp;#x200B; *Explanation: For this idea, I drew inspiration from the youtuber Handsome Mug, who proposed removing the speed penalty, at the cost of making the weapon much worse when not stationary. Similar to his, my changes allow the Heavy to reposition faster while retaining his damage output and increased resistance.* *The tradeoff is that said resistance only applies when in combat, so if you get the first shot in an engagement against the Heavy, it will do extra damage. Additionally, the overheal penalty allows Snipers to still 1-shot the Heavy when overhealed, and reduces synergy with Medics, while the increased firing speed also means you burn through ammo faster.* &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* **Huo Long Heater** *Goal: Buff the weapon and give it a new mechanic* (=) Damage bonus against burning players changed to 'mini-crits against players in the flame ring' (+) Flame ring radius increased by 50% and height increased by 100% (+) Damage dealt with this weapon fills up a 'heat' bar (300 damage to fill) * Press reload with a full bar to 'turn up the heat', gaining a 40% speedboost while revved and increasing the damage of the flame ring by 100% for 8 seconds * The eyes and mouth of the dragon's head will glow and the flame ring will emit crit particles while heat is active &amp;#x200B; *Explanation: The idea behind 'turn up the heat' was to introduce more ups and downs to Heavy's gameplay, giving him the ability to occasionally slaughter large groups of people. The buff is meant to enhance the other upside of the weapon (high close-combat DPS), allowing Heavy to output enormous damage if he can catch people unaware with it.* *The reason I made the weapon only do bonus damage against targets directly in the ring was because afterburn should be just Pyro's thing. Additionally, making the weapon reliant on afterburn to do damage would make the weapon's effectiveness depend on how many Pyros your team has.* &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* # Secondaries **Family Business** *Goal: Give this weapon a different playstyle from stock* (+) Damage increases by 20% for each teammate within 512 Hu (to a max of +60%) (-) Firing speed increase reduced to +10% (-) Damage penalty increased to -25% &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* **All Foods** (\~) When a Heavy dies holding food, the food can be picked up by players to restore health, while the dropped ammo box still gives ammo &amp;#x200B; *Explanation: Before Gun Mettle, back when dropped weapons gave ammo, food items gave +50 HP (+75 HP to Scouts) when the Heavy died holding one. Presently, the ammo box dropped gives the +50 health but doesn't give any ammo (and I don't think it gives metal either). I suggested this change simply because the idea of an ammo box functioning as a health kit just annoyed me.* &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* **Dalokohs Bar** *Goal: Give the weapon a unique role compared to the sandvich and banana* (+) Eating time reduced by 50% (+) Gives a 10 HP/second for 10 seconds after consumption (this buff is reduced by 50% while receiving health from another source) (-) Health given during consumption reduced to 50 *Explanation: To differentiate this item from the others, I've made it into a buff used before a fight rather than a health source to top you off afterward. It takes less time to eat, letting you use it in more crucial moments, and it also can heal more overall. The health over time is intended to be more useful when walking into a fight than it is in the downtime between fights.* &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* **Buffalo Steak Sandvich** *Goal: Buff the weapon to not be useless, while reducing its rollout potential* (+) Damage vulnerability removed (+) Firing speed now increased under the effects proportional to health lost (from +10% at full HP to +40% at &lt;50 HP) (=) Speedboost is no longer a constant +30%, but increases proportional to health lost (from +0% at full HP to +40% at &lt;50 HP) (\~) There is an icon (perhaps depicting a buffalo's head) on the Heavy's HUD that appears while under the effects and flickers when the effects are about to wear off &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* # Melees **Fists** *Goal: Give Heavy a fun new mechanic and encourage the use of more non-meta melees* (+) Alt-fire: shoulder charge forward, gaining a mini-crit melee strike after impacting an enemy * The charge has a 0.6 second wind up, during which Heavy is slowed * Heavy charges at 400 Hu per second for 1.5 seconds in a straight line, doing 15 damage on impact * The charge has a 2 second cooldown to prevent use in rollouts (\~) Primary fire will now attack with a random fist *Explanation: Heavy's problems relate to how little depth the class has. Something I think would help him out is the addition of a new mechanic, like Pyro's airblast, to introduce new ways to play. The shoulder charge fixes the problem of Heavy being too slow to melee people, as well as being a potentially useful quick repositioning tool. I imagine it would especially benefit shotgun and melee-focused playstyles, which are fun, but currently in need of a buff. It might even combo well with the panic attack, giving some reason to use the thing on Heavy.* *Since this is a change to a stock weapon, it would affect all Heavy's melees unless otherwise stated below.* &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* **Warrior's Spirit** *Goal: Buff the weapon, and make it a risk-reward weapon that rewards melee killing sprees* (+) On kill: shoulder charge cooldown refreshed (+) On hit: +10 HP (=) Damage vulnerability replaced with 5 HP/sec drained while active (-) 40% slower draw/holster speed &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* **Eviction Notice** *Goal: Rework the weapon into a utility that combos with the shotgun* (+) Targets hit by a shoulder charge are launched into the air (+) 20% faster draw and holster speed (=) Speed boosts (both passive and on hit) and health drain removed &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* **Gloves of Running Urgently and Fists of Steel** (-) No shoulder charge ability &amp;#x200B; *Explanation: These are Heavy's 2 best melee options, and I think they're pretty much balanced as they are (although the FoS's holster penalty may or may not be working properly) so I don't think they should be made any better by the addition of the charge. The charge would be rather pointless on both of them anyway as the GRU has a built-in speedboost and you want to avoid melee with the FoS.* &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*\*\* **Other Stuff** This is the end of the important stuff. These are just 2 random ideas I came up with during the making of this post. &amp;#x200B; Instead of simply removing the shoulder charge from the GRU and FoS, they could instead be reworked around the new mechanic. I came up with a (probably unbalanced) way to integrate it into the GRU's functioning: **Gloves of Running Urgently** (+) 100% longer shoulder charge time (+) Full turn control while charging (-) Shoulder charges are 30% slower (-) Shoulder charges drain 50 max health, which regenerates over 5 seconds when the charge ends (\~) Heavy's hands will emit fire particles while charging &amp;#x200B; I also had an idea to make the Tomislav better at ambushing and more different from Sasha, but I didn't include it because I imagined it would be controversial: **Tomislav** (+) No deployment sound (+) 20% faster, deploy speed (+) 20% faster movespeed while deployed (-) 20% slower firing speed (-) 15% less accurate \*\*\*\*\* If you have any thoughts, please write a comment (I will try to respond to them this time). Thanks for reading and I hope you liked it :)"

199,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[IDEA] Battering Ram - Demo Melee,6,bs0unl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/bs0unl/idea_battering_ram_demo_melee/,2019-05-23 19:35:44,"**+ Charging into one way doors and locked doors forces them open (for you only)** **+ Knockback inflicted on target depending on charge distance** **- 80% Less Control of charge direction** **- +25% Damage Vulnerability while active** &amp;#x200B; This weapon has a large melee range. **This weapon goes great for a defensive demoman.** Since most one way doors are for BLU to attack RED, charging into the one way doors as RED allows for more flanking routes. **The doors when forced will only open for you, and other players cannot enter.** Maps like Steel with locked spawn doors for RED work great for this weapon too, as the locked doors will be forced open with a charge attack, but for balance, your team mates cannot enter with you. &amp;#x200B; But be careful while trying to open doors, because you become very vulnerable to all sources of damage while it is active. You also can't really change the charge direction. &amp;#x200B; **Note : You cannot charge into enemy spawn doors to force them open because of spawn camping.**"
200,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[IDEA] - Unusually Revolving Gun - Scout Primary,8,bsec6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/bsec6q/idea_unusually_revolving_gun_scout_primary/,2019-05-24 18:27:59,"**Unusually Revolving Gun** * Fires six shots in quick succession automatically * Deals Mini-Crit if Player hasn't taken damage in 6 Sec * Positive: +100% Clip Size * Positive: +25% Reload Speed * Negative: Must Fire up to Six Shots in quick succession * Negative: +20% Bullet Spread Basically an idea for a weapon that relates to the Spy, the gun would look like a Scattergun although with a revolving chamber and have a few other qualities to distinguish itself from the stock, the weapon would work well for circling tactics on Scout but would be wasteful in Hit and Run tactics, this six shots would be fired \~20-33% faster than the speed for firing the stock so against an enemy up close they could prove deadly. I think at the moment this is kind of overpowered though I was thinking of giving it a ""No Crits"" negative although the fact that you're really dealing with two shots that you have some control on the damage upon I think may work as just enough of a negative, I dunno give your opinions, maybe an increased damage vulnerability or low damage vs buildings?"

The class as a whole is fine, but there are several weapons I don't like the current state of (also, I just really like making balance posts on this sub).

Since the buff banner was an offensive banner, I wanted something that improved damage output. Since a damage buff would likely be broken and a firing speed buff would screw over Pyros, I decided on this instead. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Mantreads** *Goal: make the weapon more useful for dive-bombing* (+) Create a shockwave when you land after falling (force, radius and damage based on velocity as with the stomp attack) * The shockwave would deal 1-2x your fall damage (falls off with distance from the Soldier) to everything in its radius and pop enemies slightly backwards and into the air * A shockwave after falling about the height of hightower's central tower would have a blast radius perhaps 30% larger than a rocket, and that would be the maximum strength * Enemies hit by a shockwave would experience a little screen-shake (to let enemies know what hit them) and ragdolls would be flung away violently (+) 50% fall damage resistance (does not affect stomp and shockwave damage) (I) Combine both stats pertaining to knockback into one, to reduce clutter in the description \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Reserve Shooter** *Goal: remove the weapon's ability to deny bombs* (+) 15% more accurate (-) Only crits targets launched by friendly sources of damage (i.e. not on blast jumping, thermal thrustering or mannpower grappling enemies) (-) No longer equippable to Pyro (who would instead get a new shotgun with a Pyro-themed look, name and set of stats) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Righteous Bison** *Goal: slight buff* (+) Interval between ticks of damage reduced * Basically, projectiles deal more damage more often when inside players (+) mini-crits burning enemies (-) mini-crits when it would otherwise crit &amp;#x200B; Explanation: This is basically Soundsmith's buff. The third change (stat shared with the mangler) is because the weapon was supposedly OP when crit-boosted, and the second change was to improve synergy with the mangler. You can fire the mangler's (buffed) charge shot into a crowd and use the bison's mini-crits to mop up the survivors. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **B.A.S.E. Jumper** *Goal: partially revert this thing and add a few small buffs* (+) User can use movement keys to slowly accelerate and decelerate (you cannot accelerate beyond 300 Hu/s in any direction) (+) If you are falling at a speed high enough to cause fall damage, when you get to 70 Hu above the ground, the parachute will automatically deploy (regardless of whether it had already been used this jump) (+) (hidden stat) While on fire, user will be able to float with the parachute deployed (I) If the user dies with the parachute deployed, their ragdoll will slowly float to the ground &amp;#x200B; Explanation (+ rant about 6s): In the past, I made posts like this in which I attempted to try and get weapons of the 6s banlist. Recently, however, I've decided that there's little point in doing that. 6s is a very niche format and most of the 6s banned weapons are not banned for being OP but because they would shake up the meta if they were unbanned. The JI update made this already mediocre weapon worse in an attempt to get it unbanned, and it didn't work. While I get that there was actually a problem with the weapon (I believe Uncle Dane explained it in his 'trickle-down balance' video), nerfing a weapon with the sole purpose of getting 6s players to consider using it benefits nobody. If I revert the air control nerf, at least this way pubbers will get more use out of it. I re-added the updraft while on fire because it looked fun and I didn't see any issues with it. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ # Melees **Escape Plan** *Goal: nerf its damage to prevent it completely overshadowing everything else* (-) 35% damage penalty \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Disciplinary Action** *Goal: make the weapon slightly less effective during team rollouts in comp* (-) No longer boosts the Soldier wielding the weapon (-) Speedboosts on any classes slower than 100% are slightly less effective * Speedboosts benefit slower classes the most normally (with Heavy and Solly getting +40% while Scout only gets about +26%). My intent here is to simply tone down this effect slightly (perhaps 35% boost for Heavy would be better) * Because of how the game is coded, this would also affect the conch (which I don't think would be a problem) (=) The extended melee range now applies to teammates and only to teammates (and the weapon has normal melee range against enemies, the way it was originally intended to when it was added) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Equaliser** *Goal: give the weapon another use beyond suicidal bombs (which is what the meme spoon is for)* (+) Increase damage by 13 (this gives a potential max of 120) (+) +35% health from health packs while active &amp;#x200B; Explanation: Where the escape plan is a weapon commonly used by pocket soldiers, this new equaliser is intended to be used by roamer soldiers who don't want to rely on their med for health. This would give it a utility function in addition to its current role. I also buffed the damage to minimise the amount of time the weapon spends being a straight downgrade. Also, I'm from Australia so I'm sorry if the spelling bothers you. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Pain Train** *Goal: make the weapon better in more situations* (+) Now equippable to Pyro (+) while active: 20% faster movespeed while holding the intelligence and PASS time jack (+) while active: x2 healing from payload carts and the PASS time jack (-) faster capture rate only applies while weapon is active (=) bullet damage vulnerability replaced with -15 health &amp;#x200B; Explanation: I basically copy-pasted this bit from my Pyro post. The general idea here is to make the weapon more useful in different gamemodes, while forcing the user to have to pull it out to get the upsides. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Other Notes &amp; Ideas** Another idea for the air strike was to increase its base clip size to 6, but remove the headtaking mechanic and reduce the damage a little more. This was intended to make the weapon less of a pubstomping weapon and hopefully more useful in higher level play (also, I mildly dislike the headtaking mechanic in general). I decided not to include it in the final product, but you may find it a good idea. If anyone suggests changes, they will go in a change-log somewhere down here. Thanks for reading and I hope you liked it :)"

213,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[IG/OP] Scout Balance Changes,0,b5ries,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/b5ries/igop_scout_balance_changes/,2019-03-27 03:02:54,"The scout is the best class in the game right now. Sure, he's countered by Sentries, but aside from that he is far too powerful. There's 2 main reasons why. -Incredible mobility, completely free. -Ridiculously high burst damage at close range. These two, on their own, are not that bad. But when combined... You get a class that can win a 1v1 situation against any class. Assuming both players are equal skill, Heavy is really the only class that can reliably win a 1v1 with a scout. Scout can take down Heavies though if they don't have support. On top of this, he can choose to avoid any fight that he doesn't want to try, because his mobility is FREE. Basically, Scout is overpowered because he can win almost any 1v1, and has the mobility to run away from 1v2s, or really any unfavorable situation. Sorry Scout mains, but he has to be nerfed. **All Scatterguns** ~~*Base pellet damage 6 -&gt; 5*~~ This might not seem like a big change, but it's very important. This makes his maximum damage from one shot go down to 87.5 (would be rounded to 88, current damage is 105) but because hitting the maximum damage of a Scattergun shot is not very common, it becomes significantly harder to two-shot light classes, near-impossible to two-shot medics, and makes the matchup against Demo/Pyro/Scout/Heavy much harder. Scout shouldn't be able to fight every class and win, because he can choose who he fights. **The Force-A-Nature** ~~Knockback per pellet increased 20%, number of pellets decreased to 10 per shot.~~ ~~**Reload speed increased 10%**~~ For a weapon with a damage penalty, this gun ends up doing more damage than stock more often than not. The extra pellets are completely unnecessary, and just make this weapon a crutch if your meatshots aren't totally accurate. This change makes it actually do less damage than Stock like it should, without affecting the knockback much, except at long range where the knockback of a single pellet matters. The reload speed increase is to compensate for how much damage is lost, to make it not totally worthless in the damage-side of things. **The Baby Face's Blaster** ~~Boost is no longer reduced when taking damage, but drains slowly over time~~ ~~**Boost is reduced by 50% on double jumps (from 75%)**~~ At full boost, Scout's hitbox trails behind his model. If that bug can't be fixed, the best way to improve this weapon is to just prevent Scout from being at full boost for too long. The drain rate would be something like 5% per second. If that bug is fixed, these stats don't make it underpowered. **The Back Scatter** ~~**Removed clip size penalty and extra bullet spread**~~ ~~*-10% damage penalty*~~ The Back Scatter is underpowered, because mini-crits against people's backs is not that great, and the smaller clip/bigger spread is pretty detrimental. The new stats make it function exactly like stock, but you'll be doing less damage from the front and more from the back. **The Crit-a-Cola** ~~*Marked for death for the entire duration and 5 seconds after, even if no shots are fired*~~ ~~*-10% speed penalty for 5 seconds after effects end*~~ Every time they nerf this weapon it still ends up being broken. Getting rid of the speed buff helped a lot, but there's no real risk to use it at the moment. These stats give it a risk. **The Mad Milk** ~~*Added -15 max health on wearer*~~ If you're able to heal yourself, you shouldn't also be able to take just as much damage and survive. I use the Mad Milk every time I play scout because I'm bad at scout and it helps me stay alive when I inevitably get hit during a fight. It's currently just too good for its only downside to be ""not a pistol."" **The Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol** ~~*Removed faster firing speed*~~ Self-explanatory. The weapon is obviously too good right now. **The Flying Guillotine** ~~*Added damage fall-off at range*~~ ~~*Bleed duration is lower at close range*~~ ~~**Crits bleeding players**~~ 50 damage at any range for free is way too good for Scout to have. This also brings back its crit-mechanic, except it combos with itself and the wrap assassin instead of the sandman. Crits deal 150 damage at any range. **All Scout Melees** ~~**Damage increased 35 -&gt; 40**~~ This brings Scout's melee DPS to 80, closer to the rest of the cast. (Most other classes have a melee DPS of ~81.25/sec) **The Candy Cane** ~~**Explosive damage vulnerability replace with -15 max health**~~ **The Sun-on-a-Stick** ~~**Guaranteed crits on burning players replaced with setting players on fire on hit**~~ **The Fan O' War** ~~**Damage penalty reduced 75% -&gt; 60% (16 damage and 48 crit)**~~ **The Wrap Assassin** ~~**Now combos with the Flying Guillotine**~~ So many of Scout's melees just have terrible stats. Either the downside is way too big, or the upside is way too small. This should fix all of them. I'm not going to propose a fix for the Sandman, because I don't know what would be good for it. That's all for today! Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to go hide from the incoming angry scout mains."
214,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[IG] Sniper Balance Changes,6,b654a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/b654a1/ig_sniper_balance_changes/,2019-03-28 01:27:07,"The Sniper is incredibly difficult to balance. In pubs, he's practically useless because no one is any good at using him. In high-skill environments, he's quite literally the centerpiece of every fight. Highlander specifically is just a gamemode of ""which Sniper won? That team advances."" I'm going to try my best to nerf Sniper for high-skill players that can abuse the kill anyone in one shot across the map nonsense, while trying keep him roughly the same strength in Pubs, since you're inevitably going to have 20 of them on your team. Also: I'm a Medic main but Sniper is my second-most played class. This hurts me as much as it does any of you. **General Changes** ~~*Sniper rifles now have damage fall-off at very long range*~~ Headshots deal critical hits, so this won't affect headshot damage at all. As for how long of a range, an uncharged bodyshot would be 50 damage until it hits a certain distance, just barely shorter than the distance between the 2fort battlements, at which point it would slowly go down to a minimum of 25. (150 -&gt; 75 for charged bodyshots) ~~*Must be scoped in for 1 full second before shot will start to charge*~~ This technically already exists, it's just a shorter than 1 second. ~~*Headshots have a minimum range during this time that gradually gets smaller, until the minimum range is zero after 1 second. Headshots that are closer than the minimum range only mini-crit.*~~ The minimum range would start at medium range, (approximately the distance of 2fort battlements, ignoring the parts behind walls on either side) and gradually reduce over the course of that 1 second. A good Sniper, currently, can completely negate his weakness at close range by just hitting a headshot on a nearby target. For most people, this change will make almost no difference. Hitting a headshot at that range is really difficult. In high-level play, this makes the Sniper as weak in close-range as he should be. ~~*Jarate effect no longer causes mini-crits, but just a 35% damage increase*~~ Jarate is too powerful, because Mini-crits remove damage fall-off. This keeps the damage increase of jarate practically the same, but makes it much less ridiculous. **The Machina** ~~**Damage bonus increased to 33%, applies at all times**~~ ~~**Can fire while unscoped, can penetrate while unscoped and uncharged**~~ ~~*Does not charge*~~ The bodyshot weapon- everyone hates playing against this. This change will make it a lot more fun to use for those who enjoyed the penetrating and higher damage headshots, while making it a lot less bodyshot-centric for low-skill players that like to abuse it. **The Huntsman** ~~**Stats are now displayed on the item, like they should be**~~ No idea why this isn't already true. **The Sydney Sleeper** ~~*Removed charge rate increase*~~ ~~**On death, explode into Jarate**~~ The charge rate has to be nerfed, but along with the nerf of the jarate effect, it needs another upside to make it not useless. This one fits nicely. Spies will have trouble running away after killing you. **The Bazaar Bargain** ~~*Bodyshots are unaffected by charge*~~ A small nerf, though I could probably go harder on this. It really doesn't have any actual downsides at the moment, because getting 2 headshots removes the listed downside. **The Classic** ~~**Removed: no headshots when fully charged**~~ ~~*-33% charge cap*~~ This weapon is so cool but it sucks so bad. The charge cap change means that it reaches the highest possible damage faster, but the highest possible damage is only 90 (300 on headshot) **The Cleaner's Carbine** ~~**Removed slower firing speed and smaller clip**~~ ~~*Mini-crits do not apply to Primary weapon*~~ ~~*-10% damage penalty*~~ This makes gaining Crikey take less time, makes this weapon do better damage while Crikey is active, and remove the kinda stupid ability to mini-crit with the Sniper rifles. This weapon is clearly meant to combo with the Bushwacka and itself, not primaries. **The Bushwacka** ~~Added crits Jarate'd players~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability is now on wearer, but reduced to 15%*~~ Since Jarate no longer grants mini-crits, the first change is just to make it continue to be as effective as before. The second change is because this weapon is just too cheap. It gives Sniper a low-skill option get-out-of-jail-free against Spies, and in some cases other close-range classes. If he's going to have that, he should have a bigger downside. That's all! The Sniper's secondaries and other Melees are all pretty balanced IMO once you change how Jarate works. "

217,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[IDEA] Shotgun (Heavy/Primary),1,b8hx39,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/b8hx39/idea_shotgun_heavyprimary/,2019-04-02 22:21:19,"Ok ok before you click off. Heavy right now is by far the least played class. I always found that it's because the minigun doesn't really allow for many alternative play styles. There's fat scout but that's a meme. So. What if we made fat scout viable? Give heavy a HUGE shotgun as a primary weapon that does stupid damage but has a big spread so mid/long distance shots won't be useful (Stats based off stock shotgun) I want an insane damage boost like 75% maybe even up to 100%, this could be done by increasing the pellet count or just raw damage. I'm leaning towards more pellets. -50% fire rate so shots REALLY matter +50% bullet spread (this is probably too high maybe down to 33%) -33% clip size for balance 20% damage vulnerability on wearer (this could probably be bumped up a bit more tbh, because he'll have his secondary open for sandvich) MAYBE a little speed boost, like 10%? My idea was something like the shotgun from the new doom game. Something that sounds and feels stupidly powerful. One of the heavys greatest weaknesses is being caught off guard, this is what the shotgun counters. However, his overall damage output would be highly nerfed. He won't be able to wipe out an entire team but he definitely won't be useless. "
218,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[IG] Pyro Balance Changes,11,b9jvou,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/b9jvou/ig_pyro_balance_changes/,2019-04-05 10:22:31,"The Pyro update got rid of pretty much all the jank and glitchiness of flamethrowers, but didn't completely fix his balance issues. Here's how I would fix it. Also, read this post as if random crits were removed. I don't feel like adding the stat to every weapon :p *General Changes* ~~**Close-range fire damage buffed, damage fall-off increased to compensate**~~ ~~Currently: Maximum of 173 dps, minimum of 43.3 dps, assuming all particles hit.~~ ~~After Change: Maximum of 210 dps at point blank, minimum of 40 dps.~~ Before you scream about him not needing a damage buff... Scout's current max DPS is 168. Scout is supposed to be faster and frailer, so him having practically the same damage output makes no sense. ~~*Blue Moon Update change to encourage accuracy is now more penalizing*~~ ~~Damage ramps up based on density of flame, up to 400% (from 200%)~~ ~~Initial damage reduced by 75% (from 50%) leaving max DPS unchanged~~ This is just to make accuracy matter a little more, since keeping him relatively low-skill while buffing his damage would be terrifying. *Primary Weapons* **The Backburner** ~~Reworked~~ ~~**Critical hits from behind**~~ ~~**Ammo is refilled on kill**~~ ~~*-75% ammo*~~ ~~*Cannot airblast~~ The new stats discourage using it for W+M1, because only 50 ammo means you have to be more careful when to fire. It also can't airblast at all, not even to extinguish teammates- because this is meant to be a purely offensive weapon. The ammo on kill is to counteract the tiny amount of ammo, otherwise you'd have to run for a refill after getting 1 kill every single time. It still hard punishes you from running away mid-fight, though. **The Phlogistinator** ~~**Tighter particle distribution, feels more like a laser than a flamethrower**~~ ~~*Does not cause afterburn*~~ This makes the weapon take a lot more skill to use, but simultaneously makes it do a LOT more damage if you're good. Great for 1v1s, bad for groups. The removal of afterburn is for a few reasons, it further nerfs its damage vs a group, while also making it harder to charge Mmph. **The Dragon's Fury** ~~**+20% damage bonus (unlisted)**~~ ~~*-50% Damage VS buildings*~~ At the moment, this weapon requires more skill to use but deals about the same DPS as stock. It also completely annihilates buildings because of how the stats are programmed. This weapon should have higher dps, since it punishes you so hard for missing. The 50% versus buildings might seem too much, but combined with the higher damage it overall would do only 40% less than it does currently. *Secondary Weapons* ~~Ignoring the Panic Attack and Reserve Shooter, since they're multiclass.~~ **The Detonator** ~~**Increased blast jump height slightly**~~ The Detonator is balanced as it is. This just makes it more fun, really. **The Scorch Shot** ~~**Blast jump height increased to match old Detonator stats**~~ ~~*Lowered afterburn duration on non-direct hits 7.5s -&gt; 3s*~~ This weapon is really annoying to fight against, because even if you avoid it and it hits the wall behind you, you'll suffer a total of 80 damage unless you extinguish yourself- but with how stupidly spammable this weapon is, mad milk/jarate/healthpacks etc. are very inneffective at stopping a long range Pyro from ruining your day. Getting a direct hit is unchanged, and getting a direct followed by the splash afterward is only very slightly nerfed. (the second hit currently resets the timer to 7.5, this change wouldn't affect the timer) **The Manmelter** ~~**Gain 1 crit when hitting an enemy with this weapon**~~ ~~*Non-critical hits do not set enemies on fire*~~ Currently nobody uses this unless they have the Phlog and want to extinguish teammates. This should give it a bit more of a use other than extinguishing, since getting crits with it becomes a lot less situational. Also removed afterburn to match the Phlog, because laser. **The Thermal Thruster** ~~**Removed holster time penalty**~~ Does anyone actually disagree with getting rid of it? It's not even that strong, let us have more fun Valve smh. **The Gas Passer** ~~**Charge time decreased to 20 seconds**~~ ~~**Players covered in gas are considered wet**~~ ~~*No longer charges with damage*~~ Not being affected by resupply stays. This brings it more in-line with Jarate, since it's a much weaker effect than jarate anyway. Also, Neon Annihilator synergies. *Melee Weapons* **The Homewrecker** ~~Reworked~~ ~~**+25% damage bonus vs players**~~ ~~**+100% damage bonus vs buildings**~~ ~~**Removes sappers in one hit**~~ ~~*While active: -15% speed penalty*~~ Why does a sledgehammer have a damage penalty again? This change makes the weapon more of an anti-powerjack. **The Powerjack** ~~Damage vulnerability while active removed, replaced with -25 health on wearer~~ The Powerjack is basically the only melee worth using right now, because there's no real downside to it. This should fix that. **The Back Scratcher** ~~*15% damage bonus (from 25%)*~~ ~~*Cannot be overhealed*~~ The weapon currently has no downside if you only play on the flank without a Medic. While that is a good design in concept, it needs to be slightly worse to compensate. **The Sharpened Volcano Fragment** ~~Reworked~~ ~~**+80% damage bonus**~~ ~~**On hit: Target is set on fire until death or touching resupply cabinet**~~ ~~*Wearer dies instantly from melee hits*~~ If you're swinging around a piece of a volcano... It's probably going to hurt. But even a flame-retardant suit can't protect from lava, so it's a risk to carry it around. **The Third Degree** ~~Reworked~~ ~~**Damage transfers to all players connected by Medic Beams**~~ ~~**Pierces overheal and adds 75% of removed overheal to total damage**~~ ~~**On hit against Medic: Medi-Gun is disabled for 5 seconds**~~ ~~*-66% damage penalty*~~ To explain the second stat, I'll use an example. The weapon does 22 damage by default. &gt;Hit a fully overhealed Heavy being pocketed by a Medic. 150 health is removed from Heavy, leaving him at full health instead of overheal, and 113 is added to the damage. The Heavy and Medic then both take 135 damage. The same thing happens regardless of which enemy you hit. The problem with the current weapon is that its upside does nothing useful, and it literally doesn't have a downside. This makes it actually have a use if you manage to hit a medic or his pocket, practically guaranteeing a dead medic if your team supports you. The enormous damage penalty makes this weapon useless otherwise. Since the bonus damage only occurs when someone is overhealed, hitting a second time will only do 22 damage, making it a good idea to switch to your primary/secondary after a hit. **The Hot Hand** ~~**Removed damage penalty**~~ The double-hit mechanic is already weak enough, it does not need a damage penalty on top of it. That's all for today, folks. "

Unlike my previous post, you don't have to go to a google doc's in order to look at the changes. Every change is listed in this post, with a accompanying short description providing the reasons behind the re-balance/rework. If you find a change to your disliking, want to provide critique for why a certain change does/doesn't work, or you just wish to say hi, then please comment below. I will attempt to reply to every comment within a reasonable time-frame. Also thank you for taking the time to read this post. It does mean a lot to me (especially after spending five hours writing and editing this entire post). With introductions out of the way, let us proceed: ***** **Scout** **Force-A-Nature** *Level 10 Scattergun* (+) Reload time has been reduced from 1.652s to 1.45s (+) Second shot now deals self-knockback (-) Reduce firing speed bonus from +50% to +35% (-) Increase damage threshold needed for knockback against enemy targets from 30 damage to 60 damage. &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon was design to be a sidegrade to the stock scattergun that trade consistent damage for knockback and high burst damage. Most player would consider the weapon to be slightly underpowered but overall a worthwhile side grade, and I find myself mostly agreeing with this assertion. However, the weapons low damage requirement to inflict knockback and its high burst damage potential has resulted in good scouts players being able to quickly finish off players by putting them in a semi-stun state (knockbacking players into the ground, which causes them to be launched into the air where they can't move) and then dealing up to 226 damage in quick succession. The listed changes are designed to make this stun/burst damage combo more manageable and little bit more difficult to obtain. To compensate and make the weapon slightly more viable in more situations, the lengthy reload time of the weapon has been decrease a bit and you can now quad jump with this weapon. ***** **Shortstop** *Level 1 Peppergun* (+) Increase damage bonus per pellet from +100% to +150% (from 12 to 15 damage per pellet) (+) Reduce reload time from 1.52s to 1.35s (-) Reduce maximum ramp-up value from 150% to 120% (point-blank damage doesn't change as a result) &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon was designed where the player trades high burst damage for dealing more consistent damage at range. However, its relatively low damage output at mid-long range and the long reload period has resulted in this weapon being heavily underutilized by most scout players. The listed changes are designed to make the weapon more viable in more situations by allowing it deal deal the same damage as stock when at mid to long range. However, to balance the weapons ability to make scouts better at mid range combat, the maximum damage ramp-up of the weapon has been decreased. ***** **Soda Popper** *Level 10 Scattergun* (=) Made chanages to hype mode: * Extra jumps now cost 20% of hyper mode meter per jump * Dealing damage will refill the bar with hyper mode is active * Meter still depletes, but after 5s bar depletion rate increase by 200% (=) Remove the stat ""25% faster reload time"" and reduce the resulting reload time down to 1.45s (-) Reduce faster firing speed bonus from +50% to +35% &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon was originally designed to provide scouts a damage bonus via minicrits, but has since been change to a mobility tool. The weapon is relatively fun to use in pubs, but in competitive the weapon is banned due to it making scout vs. soldier/demoman engagements lopsided by providing scouts a huge advantage when it comes to dodging projectiles. The weapons ability to quickly deal large amount of burst damage has also been noted as one of the reasons for the ban. The listed changes are designed to make the extra jump(s) mechanic of the weapon more manageable and more skilled orientated. The reduction in reload and firing speed are designed to make the weapon more in line with the re-balanced Force-A-Nature. ***** **Baby Face's Blaster** *Level 10 Scattergun* (+) Remove the stat ""Boost reduced on air jumps"" (+) Remove the stat ""10% slower move speed on wearer"" (+) Reduce damage-to-boost lost ratio from 1D/4BL to 1D/2BL (-) Obtaining maximum boost only provides a +30% speed boost (from 173% to 163%) (-) As you gain boost, the effective height of your double jump is reduce up to 50% (-) Increase damage value for full boost from 100 to 350 (-) Remove the attribute where you gain 5% boost from dealing any damage to a target &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon was designed to provide scouts a means to increase their naturally high movement speed by dealing damage in exchange for a damage penalty and slower initial movement speed. The weapon is currently underpowered due to the harsh nerfs given to it to prevent scouts from abusing the boost mechanic and dominating most one-on-one engagements. The listed changes are designed to make the weapon more viable for most situations while taking into count the reasons why the weapon was nerfed in the first place. ***** **Back Scatter** *Level 1-100 Scattergun* (+) Remove the stat ""-34% clip size"" &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon is designed around the concept of ambushing you targets and potentially one-shotting 125 health classes. The weapon fulfills its role well, but the lower clip size make the weapon less viable in most combat engagements resulting in a low usage rate among most players. The change listed is designed to make the weapon more viable in more situation, though the accuracy penalty still makes the weapon less ideal for direct combat when compared to the scattergun. ***** **Bonk! Atomic Punch** *Level 5 Lunch Box* (+) Reduce the slowdown values to the following: * Low damage: 10% movement speed penalty * High damage: 25% movement speed penalty (+) While under the invulnerability effect, 20.5% of all damage absorbed is returned as health (Does not give overheal) (-) Once invulnerability effect is over, lose the ability to double jump for 5 seconds &amp;nbsp; Description: This lunch box item is designed to allow scouts to bypass chokes and enemy defenses in exchange for losing their pistol. The nerfs made to this weapon in order to balance it for competitive tf2 have results in the item being underpowered in pubs. The listed changes are designed to make the weapon viable in pubs again while also make the weapon more counterable for competitive. As someone pointed out in the original post, these changes most likely won't result in the weapon being unbanned in competitive but it's better than nothing. ***** **Crit-a-Cola** *Level 5 lunchbox* (=) All stat have been removed and replaced with the following: (+) While effect is active: are naturally healed at a rate of 15H/s, and reload and firing speeds are increased by 35% * You do not receive overheal from the natural healing this item provides (-) While effect is active: healing from all source (excluding those provided by the item) and maximum overheal on wearer is reduced by 90% (-) Any overheal above 105% of base health fades 400% faster while under the effect and medics can't maintain it via healing (-) Item no longer naturally recharges. The player using this item now has to deal at least 350 damage for this weapon to become usable. &amp;nbsp; Description: This item was designed to give scouts a damage boost for a short period in exchange for lower survivability. The weapon in its current state is weak in pubs while still banned in competitive. The main reason this weapon is poorly balanced is the fact that it allows scout to deal minicrits; as long as this weapon provides minicrits on demand, it will never be balanced for both formats. The listed changes are designed to make the item more fair for competitive formats while still making the scout a powerful adversary while the effect is active. ***** **Mad Milk** *Level 5 Non-Milk Substance* (+) Teammates who are extinguished with this item are now healed equal to that of a small health pack (+) Can deal damage to speed up recharge rate, with 1 damage equaling to 0.75s reduce recharge time (-) Recharge time increase from 20s to 45s (-) Reduce healing rate gained by damaging coated enemies from 60% to 30% &amp;nbsp; Description: This item is designed to be a supportive tool that allows teammates to heal from damaging enemies. The high healing-via-damaging value of the item makes it too strong in competitive, resulting in a ban, and is a bit too powerful in pubs. The listed changes are designed to tone down the weapons healing potential and to prevent spam during prolong fights. To encourage scouts to extinguish teammates set alight, this item now heals extinguished teammates equal to that of a small health pack ***** **Flying Guillotine** *Level 1-100 Cleaver* (+) Weapon now deals minicrits on launched airborne targets (+) Bleed damage is minicrit boosted while target is airborne (-) Increase recharge time from 6s to 25s (-) Long distance hits now longer reduce recharge time &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon was designed to combo with certain weapons and deal bleed damage at range. The removal of the Sandman/Flying Guillotine combo have made this weapon less popular in pubs, but its fast recharge time and relatively high burst damage causes the weapon to be banned in competitive. The listed changes are designed to reduce the weapons spammability, while also making the weapon more fun to use in pubs when paired with the next weapon on this list. ***** **Sandman** *Level 15 Bat* (+) Balls that hit enemy players now launch players skyward depending on distance of ball travel * Targets that have been launched by ball will have increased air control after .5s (-) Increase recharge time of ball from 10s to 18s (-) Balls no longer inflict slowdown on enemy players &amp;nbsp; Description: The sandman was designed to allow scouts to stun enemy players for a short time in exchange for lower max health. Stun mechanics are proven to be very unpopular to most players, so valve decided to remove the weapons ability to inflict stun in exchange for making the ball inflict slowdown. This change has made the game fairer, but at the cost of making the Sandman underpowered. The listed changes are designed to make the weapon more viable and fun to use while making its ability to launch enemy players fair by providing them with a boost in air control after 0.5s have passed. The weapon now is able to be paired with the Flying Guillotine again, but to a more fairer extent than before. ***** **Candy Cane** *Level 25 Bat* (+) Add the stat ""Health packs provide a small health buff to teamates"" * Overheal buff is equal to 20.5% of base health (+) Reduce explosive damage vulnerability from 25% to 15% (-) Add the stat ""Healing from healers reduced by 50%"" &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon was designed to provide scouts a way to heal off dead enemy player by providing a small health pack on kill in exchange for extra vulnerability against explosive classes. The extra damage vulnerability against explosions have been proven to be too harsh a downside for most scouts players to consider using this weapon. The ability to spawn health packs also implies a supportive role for this weapon to fill in scout arsenal, but there is no incentive for scouts to allow teammates to use spawned healthpacks. The listed changes are designed to make the weapon have a more supportive role and be less punishing in its downsides. However, to balance the extra synergy this weapon provides when sharing health packs with teammates, a new downside has been added. ***** **Sun-on-a-Stick** *Level 10 RIFT Fire Mace* (=) All stats have been remove and replaced with the following: (+) Deal 500 damage to fill up a charge meter, then when bar is full press alt-fire to have the following effects: * While active: gain immunity to all debuffs, inflict afterburn on hit, and are healed for 35 health on hit. (+) While alight, damage-to-charge ratio is increase by 60% (+) Minicrits on burning targets (-) This weapon holsters 50% slower (-) +50% longer afterburn duration on wearer &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon was designed for scouts to deal extra melee damage with fighting alongside a friendly pyro. The weapon is currently underpowered when compared to most of scouts other melees and isn't that great when countering pyros even with the stat that decrease flame damage on wearer. The listed changes are designed make the weapon more fun to use and more useful when combating afterburn, however only while the effect is active. To make the weapon more fair for pyros, scouts with this weapon equip must deal 500 damage to gain a full charge, risk being set alight if they want to fill up the charge faster, and suffer from an increase in afterburn duration. ***** **Fan O'War** *Level 5 Gunbai* (+) Add the stat ""Gain a speed boost for 2s on hit"" (-) Marked for death effect now is removed if wearer dies &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon is designed to allow scouts to have a supportive role by inflicting the Marked for death effect on enemy player for teammates. The weapon currently only see relevance in Mann vs. Machine due to its damage penalty and the need to be within melee range to inflict the Marked for death effect on enemy players. The listed changes are designed to make this weapon more beneficial to scouts and encourage them to accept the risk of melee hitting enemy players. To make this weapon more fair to fight against, killing the player who has this weapon equipped will prematurely end the Mark for death effect they've inflicted. ***** **Soldier** **Black Box** *Level 5 Rocket Launcher* (+) Add the stat ""Hitting launched airborne targets increase healing from attacks by +150% (max. 50 health) (+) Remove the stat ""-25% clip size"" (-) Add the stat ""-45% explosive radius"" &amp;nbsp; Description: The Black box was designed to give soldiers more survivability in exchange for a smaller clip size. While not currently underpowered, it is relatively underutilized by most soldiers due to its lower healing output and smaller clip size. The listed changes are designed to make the weapon more appealing for soldiers by allowing them to gain more healing per rocket when they airshot a target. The clip size penalty has also been replaced with a explosive radius penalty, thereby making this weapon semi-similar to the Direct hit except you gain more healing instead of more damage via airshots. ***** **Liberty Launcher** *Level 25 Rocket Launcher* (+) Reduce damage penalty from -25% to -15% (+) Add the stat ""This weapon holsters 40% faster"" (+) Add the stat ""Increase vertical knockback of rockets by 100%"" (-) Remove the stat ""+25% clip size"" (-) Remove the stat ""+40% projectile speed"" &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon was designed to allow soldiers to hit their rockets more consistently via a faster projectile speed in exchange for a smaller clip size. While this weapon currently boasts a impressive amount of bonuses, the -25% reduction in damage makes this weapon too unreliable when it comes to killing enemy players in any format. The listed changes are designed to shift the Liberty Launcher away from having a multi-colored role into a weapon that aids both bombing and comboing. As a result of the change in weapon role, the faster projectile speed and extra clip size stats have been removed. ***** **Cow Mangler 5000** *Level 30 Focused Wave Projector* (=) Rework the charge shot mechanic: * Charge shots can penetrate enemy players, but each penetration now decreases damage by 10% per player * Charge shot now only minicrits against alight players * Charge shot is still able to let enemy players alight * Charge shot now only reduces movement speed by half instead of 66% * Charge shot now only take 1.5 seconds to fire instead of 2s * Charge shots consume half of clip when fired (+) Add the stat ""Kills fully reload your clip"" * This applies to both you primary and secondary weapon (-) Remove the stat ""Does not require ammo"" (-) Add the stat ""-25% max primary ammo on wearer"" &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon was designed to give soldiers a weapon that has infinite ammo, has a crowd control ability, and can disable building at the cost of a damage penalty against building and being unable to deal random critical hits. Currently, the weapon is banned in competitive since it is a straight upgrade to the stock rocket launcher in that format or in any format where there are no buildings present. The weapon charge ability is also rather lackluster and the weapon is rather unoriginal. The listed changes are designed to make the weapon more balanced for competitive while also making the weapon more interesting with the mechanic that allows one to reload their clip via killing. The charge shot has also been changed to make it more viable for general combat. ***** **Beggar's Bazooka** *Level 1-100 Rocket Launcher* (=) Projectile deviation is now determined by how many rockets are in the changer: * 1 Rocket = 0 random projectile deviation * 2 Rockets = 2 degrees of random projectile deviation * 3 Rockets = 3 degrees of random projectile deviation &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon was designed to allow soldiers to deal large amounts of burst damage in exchange for a shorter clip size, gaining no ammo from dispenser, and having the projectiles fired having random projectile deviation. This weapon is currently banned in competitive due to its random nature making it impossible to predict where the rockets from this weapon will land. The random projectile deviation also cause most players to avoid using the weapon. This change is designed to make it easier to predict where a rocket is going to go if the soldier only fire one rocket and make the weapon more accessible for most players. ***** **Air Strike** *Level 1-100 Rocket Launcher* (+) Remove the stat ""-20% explosion radius while blast jumping"" (+) Change the stat ""clip size increase on kill"" to ""Clip size and explosive radius increased on kills"" * Explosive radius is increased by 12.5% per kill (max. 50%) (-) Increase explosive radius penalty from -10% to -15% &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon was designed to allow soldier to bomb targets more efficient at the cost of lower damage, a smaller clip size, and a penalty to explosive radius. Currently the weapon damage penalty and massive explosive radius penalty prevents this weapon from truly succeeding as a bomber's best friend. The listed changes are designed to make the weapon more efficient when it comes to bombing instead of reducing it efficiency, however at a cost of a greater explosive radius penalty while on the ground. ***** **Reserve Shooter** *Level 10 Shotgun* (+) Add the stat ""20% more accurate"" (-) Weapon now only minicrits targets that have been launched by the player who has the weapon equipped (-) Pyro can no longer equip this weapon &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon was designed to be a combo weapon for both the soldier and pyro to use. When the weapon was change to no longer be able to minicrit air-blasted targets, the weapon become effectively useless on pyro. On soldier, the weapon has proven to be too effective at denying bombing soldiers and demoman in competitive tf2 and so it is currently banned. The listed changes are designed to make the weapon more fair to use by requiring players to launch enemy players in order to deal minicrit damage. The accuracy bonus is there to make the weapon more appealing to soldier, while removing the ability for pyros to equip the weapon is design to make balancing this weapon easier. ***** **Righteous Bision** *Level 30 Indivisible Particle Smasher* (=) The stat ""Projectile cannot be deflected"" is now hidden (+) Increase base damage from 20 to 25 (+) Add the stat ""While at full health, gain overheal from damaging enemies"" * 60% of damage dealt is converted into overheal (-) Add the stat ""Cannot be critboosted"" &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon was designed to provide soldiers a secondary that doesn't require ammo and can penetrate enemies in exchange for dealing less damage against buildings. Most players believe that this weapon only needs a base damage increase to be viable, but the weapon has never been considered a viable side grade to the shotgun even with its original damage output. The listed changes are designed to make the weapon more viable in most situations and provided a utility that the stock Shotgun can't provided. ***** **Base Jumper** *Level 1-100 Parachute* (+) Getting a kill while airborne allows user to redeploy parachute &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon was designed to combo with the Air Strike and allow for multiple bombing attempts within a single rocket jump. While the weapon has been balanced for competitive tf2, the lack of air control and inability to re-deploy while airborne makes this weapon relatively situational in most formats and leaves soldiers and demomans who have their parachutes deploy in a very vulnerable position. The listed change is designed to allow soldier and demoman a bit more freedom when it comes to deploying and redeploying their parachute while making sure players have to work for the ability to re-deploy their parachute. ***** **Equalizer** *Level 10 Pickaxe* (+) While active: players gain a bonus to damage and health from packs as they become more injured &amp;nbsp; Description: Originally having both it current stats and the Escape Plans stats, this weapon was redesigned to be a weapon that allows soldier to deal more melee damage as their health gets lower. A soldier, who is the second slowest class in the game, at low health is easy picking for most classes, so the extra melee damage rarely comes into play. Overall, the Escape Plan provides a better utility and is the main reason for why this weapon is almost never used. The listed change is designed to make this weapon provide a utility that is lacking is soldiers arsenal. Since the Escape Plan is a pocket soldiers preferred melee, it only makes sense to make the Equalizer the preferred melee for roaming soldiers. ***** **Pain Train** *Level 5 Makeshift Club* (=) All stats have been removed and replaced with the following: (+) While on or near objective: +1 capture rate and +20% healing rate from healers (+) While holding intel briefcase, australium briefcase or PASS time jack: +20% speed boost (+) Pyro is now able to equip this weapon (-) -15 max health &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon is designed to make both soldier and demoman better at capturing objective at the cost of having a 10% damage vulnerability to bullets. While good option in competitive, in pubs this weapon is rarely used due to it being specific to one game mode; the damage vulnerability to bullets also rarely ends up being a factor in most engagements and is considered by most players to be meaningless. The listed changes are designed to make the weapon useful in more game modes, increase usage by allowing pyros to equip it, and making the downside more impactful without being too punishing. ***** **Disciplinary Action** *Level 10 Riding Crop* (-) Add the stat ""No Random Critical Hits"" &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon is designed to allow soldier to support their team by giving them a speed boost at the cost of melee damage. This weapon main issue is it seemingly random hit registration that allows it to be very effective at melee combat, yet also making the process of giving teammates a speed boost unreliable at best. The listed change is just to make the weapon less effective a melee combat as it should be. Only valve can fix the issues with hit registration and it is unknown if they will even bother. ***** **Demoman** **Ali Baba's Wee Booties** *Level 10 Boots* (=) All stat have been removed and replaced with the following: (+) While equipped: -40% blast damage from sticky jumps and +200% increase air control while blast jumping &amp;nbsp; Description: This item was designed to allow demoman to gain increase health and increase charge turning speed. Currently this weapon is designed for demoknight and shares its stats with the Bootlegger. While not unbalanced, the fact that there are two boot unlocks for demoman and they share the same stats is disappointing. The listed changes are designed to make this item unique in demomans arsenal by allowing demoman to take less damage from sticky jumps and have increase air control in exchange for their Grenade Launcher. Due note that you still take a significant amount of self-damage for balance reasons. ***** **Scottish Resistance** *Level 5 Stickybomb Launcher* (+) Reduce slower bomb arm time from 0.8s to 0.4s (-) Reduce max secondary ammo on wearer from +50% to +25% (-) Reduce firing speed bonus from +25% to +15% (-) Reduce max pipebomb that can be deployed from +6 to +4 &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon is designed to be a superior defensive tool when compared to the Stock Stickybomb Launcher, at the cost of being worst for offensive pushes. While very powerful on defense, the weapon inability to be able to quickly adapt to changing situations causes most players to stick with the stock Sitckybomb Launcher. The weapon also has the potential to cause stalemates due to it attribute of being able to have more stickies out. The listed changes are designed to make the weapon more versatile when it comes to adapting to the flow of a match while still being the weapon of choice for defensive player. The reduction in the max pipebomb that can be deployed, it firing speed bonus, and max secondary ammo is to decrease this weapon effectiveness in causing stalemates. ***** **Quickiebomb Launcher** *Level 1-99 Stickybomb Launcher* (+) Add the stat ""-25% blast damage from sticky jumps"" (+) Reduce clip size penalty from -50% to -25% (+) Remove the stat ""-15% damage penalty"" (+) Add the stat ""+20% damage"" (-) Remove the stat ""Max charge time decreased by 70%"" (-) Remove the stat ""Up to +35% damage based on charge"" (-) Add the stat ""-50% explosive radius"" (-) This weapon is no longer affected by ramp-up damage &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon was designed to be more effective at ""Sticky Spamming"" than the Stock Stickybomb Launcher at the cost of being worst at area denial and defending. The clip size penalty and the need to constantly charge up a shot in order to deal more damage causes most players to prefer using stock over this weapon due to the former's reliability and simple to obtain high damage output. The listed changes are designed to encourage usage of the weapon by reducing the clip size penalty and simplifying the weapon mechanics. To make the weapon more appealing, a new stat has been added where you take less self-damage from sticky jumps. A damage bonus has also been added to make Sticky Spamming more effective when using this weapon than stock. To balance these changes, the stats ""Max charge time decreased by 70%"" and ""Up to +35% damage based on charge"" have been removed, an explosive radius penalty has been added, and this weapon is no longer affected by damage ramp-up. ***** **Eyelander** *Level 5 Sword* (-) Heads are now lost if player switches from shield to stickybomb launcher and vice versa. (-) Heads no longer give a bonus in charge impact damage &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon is designed to initially lower demomans survivability in exchange for allowing him the chance to increase his max health, speed, and charge impact damage by collecting heads from enemy players. While certainly a fun weapon to use, there is a feature of this weapon that allows demoman to switch between their shield to their stock Stickybomb launcher and Grenade Launcher while retaining their heads. Allowing players to essentially ""upgrade"" themselves via this simple method is broken and shouldn't exist. The Eyelander also tends to outshine demoman other sword because of the bonuses it provides. The listed changes are designed to fix an issue that allows players to upgrade their classes base stats without consequence and provide other swords the opportunity to shine without being constantly overshadowed by the Eyelander. ***** **Claidheamh Mr** *Level 5 Sword* (+) Remove the stat ""15% damage vulnerability on wearer"" (+) Add the stat ""Increase charge impact damage based on charge travel distance"" * Charge impact damage is increased from 10% to 50% based on distance * Increase in charge impact damage only occurs while weapon is active (+) Increase in charge duration no longer requires weapon to be active (-) Add the stat ""-15 max health on wearer"" &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon was originally designed to allow demoman to gain a increase in charge duration at the cost of lower max health. This weapon has always been overshadowed by the Eyelander due to the latter's more impactful bonuses. The weapon currently isn't in a bad spot, but it could be improved to allow it to compete with the Eyelander when it comes to demoknight. The listed changes are designed to make the weapon more appealing for players who want to hybridknight/fully demoknight. The weapon no longer needs to be active for you to benefit from the increase in charge duration, but you will need to have the weapon active in order to deal increase impact damage. Replacing the damage vulnerability for a straight reduction in max health is to counter balance the way this weapon provides it bonus in charge duration. ***** **Ullapool Caber** *Level 10 Stick Bomb* (+) Remove the stat ""20% slower firing speed"" (+) Reduce deploy penalty from 100% to 50% (+) Add the stat ""Deals minicrits while the wielder is explosive jumping"" (+) After caber explodes, takes 30s to passively recharge &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon was designed to give demoman a way to defend themselves via a high damaging melee at the risk of dealing high self-damage when used. Currently, the weapon is in a very poor condition. The nerfs given to it were to prevent demoman from being able to quickly deal with low health classes and instant kill medics, but valve overdid it and left the weapon in its current state. The listed changes are designed to overall buff the cabers effectiveness and make it function similar to the Market Gardener on Soldier. You are able to one shot snipers again, but only if you manage to land a hit while explosive jumping. ***** **Scotsman's Skullcutter** *Level 5 Axe* (+) Add the stat ""On kill: gain 4 seconds of minicrits for melee"" (-) Add the stat ""No Random Crtical Hits"" &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon was design simply to give demoknight a weapon that deals more damage at the cost of reducing demos movement speed. Currently, this is the only demoman sword to still be able to deal random crits and, combined with the damage bonus this weapon has, getting into a melee fight with a demo equip with this weapon is essentially playing the lottery on whether he crit kills you before you kill him. The slower movement speed while the weapon is active also causes most players to avoid using this weapon. The listed changes are designed to eliminate the random factor of the weapon while also making it the ideal option for dealing as much damage as demoknight. The ability to gain minicrits is limited to melees to make sure the weapon isn't OP while also encouraging its use among demoknights. ***** **Persian Persuader** *Level 10 Sword* (+) Remove the stat -80% max primary ammo on wearer"" (+) Decrease max secondary ammo penalty from -80% to -70% (+) Add the stat ""Ammo packs now also act like health packs * Ammo packs always heal equal to that of a small health pack (-) Remove the stat ""Ammo boxes collected give charge"" &amp;nbsp; Description: This weapon was originally designed to boost you charge recharge speed and give demoman the ability to heal off ammo packs at the cost of ammo packs no longer giving ammo. Currently, the weapon is designed to eschew players away from using their explosive based weapon and use a full demoknight loadout. This design philosophy, however, limits this weapons potential when paired with other weapons and essentially discourages hybridknighting which is quite popular with a majority of players. The listed changes are designed to increase the weapons potential to be paired with demo's primary weapons and to reintroduce the mechanic of ammo packs providing health. Ammo packs still give you ammo, they just now also act like small health packs."

It is geared towards competitive play, and an excel if you want to end a Payload or Control Point match quickly; but it's a complete downgrade in 7(!) of the game's various modes. Truthfully, you'll only ever see this weapon being memed with in CTF matches, likely on a Demoknight going on a crit spree (because that's the weapon's TRUE upside). So here, I've tried to change that. The Pain Train now has a function related to CTF matches as well, so if you want to end those games quickly too, that's a decent option. More important, however, is the second upside: faster swing speed as health decreases. Given that this weapon is known for critting often, this widens the threshold for crits to happen; moreover, this gives the weapon a functional upside regardless of game mode, which it sorely needs. It also provides a defensive option for players going for the objective, since that upside now requires the weapon to be active. Lastly, the bullet damage vulnerability has been slightly increased.

This synergies with heavys shotgun and minigun as he can shoot to detonate the pumpkin bomb for massive damage. The small health pack on kill also helps heavy to help support the shotgun secondary combo instead of using the banana or sandwich for healing. The candy cane was the main inspiration for this weapon so I added the health kit on kill and added a twist to it with the pumpkinfying of enemies. For the downsides, I stuck with a 20% explosive so that heavy takes more damage if he doesnt walk far enough from the pumpkin bomb as well as the slower hostering speed to give other players some reaction time to get away as well. Heavy could just punch to detonate the pumpkin bomb but risks losing more than half of his health if he does.

An Engineer isnt going to be encountering a Pyro too often if hes playing defense, and 20% isnt going to make or break enough situations for it to really matter all too much. I think a weapon that brings all buildings to only Level 2 is something many of us have thought about, because of the ongoing Level 2 vs. Level 3 Sentry debate, but I always thought about what the upside would need to be for someone to willingly give up Level 3 dispensers and teleporters. Normal sentries deal 16 damage per bullet, with Level 1 firing 4 times a second for a DPS of -64h/s, while Level 2 &amp; 3s fire 8 times a second for a DPS of -128h/s. Sentries from the New Southern Hospitality would deal 12 damage per bullet, meaning raw bullet damage only does -48h/s and -96h/s, respective to the Sentrys level. However, bleed damage does 4 damage every half-second, bringing it up to -56h/s and -104h/s, and 5 seconds of bleed adds 40 more damage once the target is not being hit. It makes the Sentry much more lethal, but slower to kill, which I think is an interesting trade-off. Do you guys have any questions? I spent a lot of time on this idea, Id love to see feedback! "

By reducing the construction from 21s to 17s, engineers can begin aiding their teammates with heals/ammo resupply and teleports at a faster rate than before as well as encourage engineers to move their gear up more often. ***** **The Frontier Justice** *Level 5 Shotgun* (-) Sentry gun kills and assist now only reward mini-crits instead of full critical hits. (+) Add the stat: +15% increase damage to your sentrys target &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: While allowing engineers to go on a mini-rampage makes the weapon enjoyable to use as engineer, the ability to gain full crits by destroying your sentry gun made this weapon too effective at killing enemy players that managed to destroy your nest while defending. The crit mechanic of this weapon also proved to be annoying when combined with the gunslinger and mini-sentry. With these reasons in mind, this weapon now only receive minicrits based on the number of kills/assists your sentry gun obtained before it destruction instead of full critical hits. Also, to make this weapon more interesting to play with, you deal +15% more damage to enemy players who are being targeted by your sentry gun. ***** **Widowmaker** *Level 5 Shotgun* (-) Remove the stat ""10% increased damage to your sentry's target"" &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: The weapon before the addition of this stat was perfectly fine and did not need a buff. The removal of this stat also allows the Frontier Justice to receive a similar stat without conflicting with the stats of this weapon. ***** **Pomson 6000** *Level 10 Indivisible Particle Smasher* (=) All stats have been removed and replaced with the following: (+) Does not require ammo (has a clip size of 4) (+) Primary fire shots out a fast moving, but slightly weak projectile. Cost one ammo. - Maximum ramp-up (125%): 60 - Base damage: 48 (+) Secondary fire shoots out a shotgun-like hitscan attack that is able to mini-crit cloaked enemies. Cost 2 ammo. - Maximum ramp-up (120%): 7.2-72 - Base damage: 6-60 - Maximum fall-off (50%): 3-30 (-) Deal only 20% damage to buildings (-) No random critical hits &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: The Pomson 6000 is considered to be engineer's weakest and most annoying primary, and it isn't that hard to see why. Lacking the large burst damage of the stock shotgun, while also allowing engineers to screws with key mechanics of two other classes, this weapon is both unfun to use and unfun to fight against. I believe the weapon should act as the weapon engineers use for fighting at long range, however just making this weapon effective at longer ranges is unlikely to result in a uptick in usage rates among engineer players. To help make this weapon more appealing, I have made it so that, via secondary fire, this weapon also fires a pellet-like hitscan attack that is able to mini-crit cloak enemies at the cost of half a clip. This means that this weapon will be a effective tool when it comes at spy checking as well as being effective at dealing damage at range. ***** **Rescue Ranger** *Level 1-100 Shotgun* (+) Base healing per bolt increased from 60 to 75 (-) Increase health-to-metal ratio from 4:1 to 3:1.(Cost between 25-10 metal per bolt to heal a building) (-) Healing per bolt now depends on distance from target building. Within 180 hammer units, bolts heal for 75. After 180, healing drops until it reaches a healing rate of only 30 at 720 hammer units and beyond. &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: The Rescue ranger has always been the go-to primary for defensive play, yet it has proven to be too strong in competitive 6s due to a lack of concern for metal management and the fact that healing does not decay based on distance. To make this weapon more balanced for competitive play and make metal management with this weapon more impactful, the health-to-metal ratio has been increased from 4:1 to 3:1. Also, to prevent engineers from healing their building from a distance within the safety of spawn, the amount of health you heal buildings now depends of distance. To prevent this weapon from becoming underpowered and to allow for better health-to-metal conversion, bolts now heal for a maximum of 75 health instead of 60. ***** **The Wrangler** *Level 5 Laser Pointer* ######The shield mechanic of this weapon has been reworked: (-) Shield now has a health bar of 350 health. (Damage to the shield is not affected by the damage resistance the shield gives) (=) As shield health depletes cracks will start to appear in the shield. This is to serve as a visible cue for both the owner and enemy players that the shield is nearing destruction. (=) Once health bar is depleted, the shield is disabled. Also the healing penalty towards the wrangled sentry gun is removed while shield is disabled. (=) Weapon must be inactive and 2.25 seconds must pass before shield health starts to regenerate. Shield health regenerates at a rate of 35 health per second. &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: The wrangler has always proved to be very strong on defense, to the point where a good engineer can easily cause a match to stalemate with the aid of his team. These changes are to address these issues while still allowing engineers to use this weapon for defensive play. ***** **Southern Hospitality** *Level 20 Wrench* (+) Remove the stat ""20% fire damage vulnerability on wearer"" (+) Add the stat ""+20% faster repair rate"" (-) Add the stat ""Upgrading a building now cost +60% more metal per swing"" (This means it cost 40 metal to add 25 metal towards upgrading a building. This does not mean you upgrade faster) &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: While not necessary underpowered, the Southern Hospitality is a rather bland weapon in engineer's arsenal. To fix this, I have removed the worthless downside of being more vulnerable to fire damage and added a new stat that makes this wrench the go-to defensive wrench. You are now able to maintain your buildings easier with this wrench, however to balance this you now need to invest more metal in upgrading your buildings. Basically, this wrench allows you to maintain you base easier, while also making it harder to actually build up a base from scratch. ***** **Eureka Effect** *Level 20 Wrench* (+) Teleporting to spawn automatically refill you metal supply. &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: This change just makes teleporting to spawn in order to refill you metal much easier and less time consuming. ***** **Soldier** &amp;nbsp; **The Direct Hit** *Level 1 Rocket Launcher* (-) Change the stat ""+25% damage bonus"" to ""+25% damage vs. players"" &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: While a relatively balance weapon that rewards people with good aim with extra damage, this weapon is too strong of a counter towards engineers. The extra damage, plus the faster projectile speed, makes this weapon very powerful against buildings, while at the same time allow little counter-play on the engineers part. To fix this issue, I have made it so that the extra damage from this weapon only applies to players and not buildings. Engineers will still need to deal with the faster projectile speed, but at least fighting against this weapon will be more manageable now. ***** **Demoman** &amp;nbsp; **The Loch-n-Load** *Level 10 Grenade Launcher* (=) Change the stat ""+20% damage vs. buildings"" to ""+20% damage bonus vs players"" (-) Remove the stat ""+25% projectile speed"" stat (+) Add the stat ""Mini-crits targets launched airborne by explosions, grapple hooks or rocket packs."" (-) Increase explosion radius penalty from -25% to -75% &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: Similar to the Direct hit, the Loch-N-Load is too effective as a counter against buildings while allowing very little counter play on the engineer part. Also the faster projectile speed make this weapon too effective at hitting targets on a class that is suppose to have some difficulty with hitting targets with their grenade launcher. The reason the faster projectile speed works on the direct hit but not the Loch-N-Load is due to rockets being affected by damage fall-off, while grenades always deal 100 damage at any range, making killing a low health classes a medium-long range (aka scouts) rather easy. To fix these issues, I have decided to make this weapon less of a anti-building tool and more of a combo weapon similar to the direct hit. Now you deal +20% more damage against players only and you now also mini-crit launched targets, however this comes at the cost of losing the faster projectile speed and a significant increase in the explosive radius penalty. ***** **Spy** &amp;nbsp; **All watches** (+) Reduce decloak fade time for players from 2.2 to 2s (same as stock) (+) Increase decloak fade time for outside observers from 1.8s to 2.3s. &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: Cloak is one of the fundamental mechanic for the spy and, while it certainly has gotten some useful buffs in the past few years, I have one issue with how cloak works and it revolves around decloaking. When you decloak, there are two decloak timers: one for the player and one for outside observers. The timer for the player governs how long they have to wait until they can use their weapon after decloaking, while the timer for outside observers is just a cosmetic effect for other players to see that the spy is decloaking. For spies, being able to decloak at the right time is crucial when it comes to playing the class, and yet their are currently two watches (CnD and DR) where you actually have to wait longer after exiting cloak before you can backstab an enemy. Also the fact that enemies players have 0.2 -0.4 seconds where they can see you without being semi-cloak just results in a lot of miss opportunities for spy plays, especially in higher levels of play. In those reason, I suggest that the decloak fade time for players on both the Cloak and Dagger and Dead Ringer be brought down to stock level. To promote more risky spy play and punish players for not paying attention to sound and visual cues, I also suggest that the decloak fade time for outside observers be increase for all watches from 1.8s to 2.3s. The latter change should give spies more room to act before being spotted while (hopefully) not being too unbalanced. ***** **Dead Ringer** *Level 5 Invis Watch* (=) Remove the following stats: ""-50% cloak meter when Feign Death is activated"" and ""+40% cloak duration"" (+) Ammo and dispensers now refill the spy's cloak meter while uncloaked (-) Add the stat: ""-60% cloak meter from ammo boxes and dispensers"" (-) Damage from outside sources now reduces cloak duration at a 4 damage to 1% cloak meter ratio. Damage resistances do not decrease the amount of cloak lost from damage. (=) Damage resistances during cloak now depends on cloak meter amount. Once activated, you still start at a 65% damage resistance, but every seconds will now reduce you damage resistance by 7.5% until you are at the stock 20% damage resistance. This process usually takes 6 seconds, but can be decrease through damage or increase by equipping weapon that increase cloak duration (L'Entranger). &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: The changes I wish to make to this watch introduces a level of counter play that allows players to better counter players using this weapon, while forcing spies to make better use of this weapon instead of just using it as a crutch to make up for poor plays. First, I have removed the two stat that affect this watch's cloak duration; now you will only be able to cloak for 10s (14s with L'Etranger). Second, taking damage while cloak now reduces you cloak duration depending on the amount of damage dealt. The damage resistances this watch gives does not affect the amount of cloak lost, so taking a 90 damaging rocket to the face will always take away 22.5% of cloak from your meter. This makes actively shooting a cloak spy more rewarding, since you are now actively reducing their cloak duration. Third, the amount of damage resistance you gain while cloak is dependents on how much cloak duration is left, with the base rate being 7.5% damage resistance lost ever second while cloaked. The rate can be increased (through damage) or decreased (L'Etranger). Again, this makes it rewarding to actively track down a dead ringer and encourages spies to be more active at avoiding damage while cloaked. And Lastly, you can now refill your cloak meter with ammo and dispenser. You need to be uncloaked in order to refill you cloak meter through these means and ammo and dispenser are only 40% effective at refilling you cloak meter. ***** **Disguise Kit** *Level 1 ...Cigarette Case?* (+) While cloak, based on the role type of your disguise, gain the following buffs: - Offensive: +10% movement speed (does not stack with other speed boost) - Defensive: +20% explosive resistance and -75% knockback from damage (doesn't stack with dead ringer) - Support: +2 health regen. &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: While disguises can still prove useful for tricking players into believing you are a fellow teammate, most players have long since figured out the mechanics of disguising and spy checking has become rather routine even for teams without pyros. Some people believe that allowing spies to fire off blank shots while disguised will allow spies to better trick people, but it would only be a matter of time before most players figure this trick out and effectively counter it. So, instead of allowing spies to better act, I believe we should make disguises provide a useful utility benefit to spies while both disguised and cloaked. This will make certain disguises that are rarely used more enticing (scout, soldier, heavy, and spy) while not just giving spies a general buff while disguised. ***** **Diamondback** *Level 5 Revolver* ######All stats have been removed and replaced with the following: (+) On each building destroyed or backstab kill, gain a 7.5% increase in effectiveness for sappers (4 max.) (+) Mini-crit from behind (-) -50% clip size (-) No Random critical hits. &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: While not used by a lot of spies, this weapon is clearly not fun to fight against. Giving spies the ability to deal 102 damaging bodyshots just because he destroyed a single building or backstabed a new player just isn't fair to the enemy team. While OP in pubs, the exact opposite is true in competitive. Due to how easily spies are killed in competitive, they rarely get to use their crits from a backstab before they die. These changes fix both issues. By making this weapon more of a tool against engineer, this weapon becomes less of a ""win more"" weapon and more a team player tool for taking down sentry nests. Also, by allow this weapon to mini-crit behind players, this weapon now has a function in competitive play. These two bonuses come at the cost of having only a clip size of three shots, making this weapon less effective a self defense. ***** **Red Tape Recorder** *Level 1-100 Sapper* (+) Increase downgrade speed by 20% - Downgrade: 3.4s to 2.72s - Sentry: 10.7s to 8.8s - Dispenser: 17.4s to 13.92s - Teleporter: 17.4s to 13.92s - Mini-sentry: 10.5s to 8.77s (+) Add the stat: Espionage: while sapping buildings, cloak recharge increased and cloak drain decreased by 50%* *Dead ringer will not experience an increase in cloak recharge rate nor a decrease in cloak drain rate while spy is cloaked. &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: the Red tape has been the worst sapper in spy's arsenal for a while now. While it does currently have a niche role in fighting against gunslinger engineers, when compared to the stock sapper in every other situation this weapon just can't compete. To make the red tape recorder have more of a impact, I suggest two changes. First, increase the downgrade speed by 20% so that it is able to take down sentry nest must easier, though not to the extent where it would be unfair for the engineer. Second, I suggest adding a new stat called Espionage. With Espionage, while you are sapping a building, you regain cloak 50% faster as well as use 50% less cloak. Taking the stock watch as an example, while sapping it takes only 15s to fully regain you cloak meter instead of 30s and you stay cloak for 15s (21s with the L'Entrager) instead of only 10s (14s). Do note that, for the sake of balance and to prevent the weapon from being spammable, the dead ringer only gains the faster cloak recharge rate while you are uncloaked and the duration of the cloak itself is not increased. ***** If you have any question, criticisms, or just want submit a change, then please comment below. I will attempt to reply to all comments within a reasonable time frame. Thank you for reading my post. "

This needs a use whenever there's no Pyro in either teams. This is almost a complete rework because I turned it into something very different. I suggest the SoaS gets a ball like the Sandman and Wrap Assassin. Its recharge rate would be 12.5 seconds, a bit longer than the Sandman. Whenever this ball hits an enemy it does no damage, but they catch on fire. However, the fire is different compared to normal fire, as it has a -75% damage penalty and lasts 10 seconds. This would mean the afterburn would do 20 damage in total. The point of the fire is not to just damage them, but rather so you can escape them, which explains my next stat. You will take 20% less damage from the player you hit with your fire ball, but at the same time you also do 60% less damage towards them. The SoaS also has a +15% damage vulnerability now, making it a risky weapon to hold already. As another downside it has a -50% damage penalty but as another upside and does crits on enemies that are on fire. One (somewhat irrelevant) flaw I can see is that it's from RIFT. I know nothing about that game, but it may not make much sense if the weapon (?) in that game works very differently."

Enjoy, feedback welcome. &amp;#x200B; **Baby Face's Blaster** &amp;#x200B; \*Maximum boost damage increased to 400 from 100\* \*Boost drain to minimum increased from 25 to 100\* &amp;#x200B; A simple change for a simple idea; just make the boost harder to drain. However, being harder to drop it, it's harder to pick up. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **Crit-a-Cola** &amp;#x200B; \*No longer charges over time. Requires 300 damage to charge\* &amp;#x200B; The Cola is simply a free damage boost usable right out the gate meaning the scout is never really at a disadvantage. Here, the idea is simply make the scout engage at a disadvantage (no secondary) to gain the effects. Charge damage is the same as the Phlogistinator. &amp;#x200B; **Candy Cane** &amp;#x200B; \*Removed explosive vulnerability\* \*Added -90% healing from medics and dispensers while equipped\* &amp;#x200B; The explosive vulnerability makes this weapon borderline unusable in the vast majority of situations. A new downside was introduced to support the idea of a flanking scout, sustaining himself through healthpacks dropped by kills. &amp;#x200B; **Fan O'War** &amp;#x200B; \*Added 50% faster switch speed\* &amp;#x200B; A simply buff to make using it a little more practical; you can get it out, hit, and put it away quicker, making it potentially more useful than just shooting them twice with your primary. &amp;#x200B; **Black Box** &amp;#x200B; \*Changed ""up to +20 heath on hit"" to ""+60 health on kill""\* &amp;#x200B; The black box often feels like you're fighting the weapon, not the user. The 60 HP on kill will result in higher healing on average, but rewarding kills rather than rewarding spam damage. &amp;#x200B; **Degreaser** &amp;#x200B; \*Added -20% damage\* &amp;#x200B; The afterburn and airblast penalty are very low value, providing very little trade-off for easier weapon comboing. This results in a 35 DPS drop, giving the weapon an obvious roll and tangible downside. &amp;#x200B; **Gas Passer** &amp;#x200B; \*Shooting the cloud will deal 50 damage to everyone inside the cloud, falling off to 10 damage towards the outer edge of the cloud\* &amp;#x200B; The only real use for the Gas Passer is to set Pyros on fire... which is only really useful if you've got the Axtinguisher (and they can just airblast you away) or the flaregun... which you don't have because you have the Gas Passer. In the end, anything you're trying to do with the Passer is done better with the Scorch Shot. The goal is to simply provide the weapon with the capacity to fulfill its apparent area-denial role. &amp;#x200B; **Loch-n-Load** &amp;#x200B; \*Pierces resistances\* &amp;#x200B; Ah, the Loch-n-Load. A great anti-building weapon... when Demo normally has an entire slot much better suited to destroying buildings. This has left the weapon long in limbo where it doesn't really have a dedicated use other than being easier to use. &amp;#x200B; The resistance piercing will give demos an option against both the Vaccinator, AND the Wrangler, two weapons which can be very frustrating for demos to fight, an ability that is difficult to replicate with other weapons. &amp;#x200B; **Chargin' Targe** &amp;#x200B; \*Added -50% knockback on wearer\* &amp;#x200B; I love all the shields, and all are useful... but it's pretty much universally accepted that the Targe is the weakest of the shields. The lower resistances on the Screen is more than made up for by its lightning fast recharge, and the Turner's mobility makes it arguably the best for hybrid knights. &amp;#x200B; The buff to the Targe will give it something unique, and give each of the three shields a dedicated reason to exist, without overbuffing the already great OG Demo shield. &amp;#x200B; **Ubersaw** &amp;#x200B; \*Decreased 25% Ubercharge on hit, to 15% on hit\* &amp;#x200B; The Ubersaw is one of the most slot-dominant weapons in the game. The next biggest challenger is the Vita Saw, and well... would you rather have: 4 hits, granting you 60% Uber that you've already built and only if you die first? Or 4 hits granting you 100% uber that can save you from death? &amp;#x200B; Lowering the Ubersaw's much more convenient uber, combined with my next suggestion, should help even the two out. &amp;#x200B; **Vita Saw** &amp;#x200B; \*Increased Uber retained per Organ to 20%\* \*Increased maximum Uber retained to 80%\* &amp;#x200B; This now means the Vita Saw will grant you more ""charge"" per hit, but the Ubersaw can use that charge instantly. This should provide a good exchange between the two, making the decision between which saw to take much more based on personal choice and the flow of the game. Increasing retained uber to 100% could potentially nullify a drop, making it potentially overpowered. &amp;#x200B; **Bushwacka** &amp;#x200B; \*Damage reduced by 23%\* \*Damage vulnerability is now passive and increased to 25%\* &amp;#x200B; The Bushwacka has two issues: A lack of a significant downside, with the damage vulnerability only when the player draws it and then still requiring the same number of shots in most situations. This nerf now means; if you're not making frequent use of it, it's not worth carrying. &amp;#x200B; Secondly; it provides the dedicated long-range class one of the most powerful melee combos in the game, with a free Jarate toss and a 195 damage swing. By reducing damage to 50 (77% of stock, AKA -23%) it will still be a powerful one-two, allowing you to kill anything below 150 HP, but will require good footwork and a second hit to kill anything above that. &amp;#x200B; Note: Max overheal on sniper is 187, this will make a quickscope deal exactly 187 damage. &amp;#x200B; Powerful, but risky; a good melee combo for the long range class. This one won't be controversial in the slightest. &amp;#x200B; **Diamondback** &amp;#x200B; \*Removed stored crits\* &amp;#x200B; \*Added: 2 seconds critboost on backstab\* \*Added: 1 second critboost on sapped building destroyed\* &amp;#x200B; The Diamondback is currently a powerful weapon, with its only viable competition for damage being the Amby... oh wait... Either way: The Stored crits are a huge headache, and often punish you for having poor teammates. Changing from guaranteed crits to critboost changes this from a weapon that simply gives spy a higher DPS than a demo for very little cost, to a weapon that requires good planning and execution: Stabbing a risky target, and using the sudden crit boost to deal large damage to make your escape or to capitalize on unaware opponents. &amp;#x200B; The larger boost on stabbing a target was to account for the higher risk of moving out of cover to engage without any boost, versus sapping an unattended dispenser, and only decloaking half a second before it is destroyed. &amp;#x200B; **Red Tape Recorder** &amp;#x200B; \*Added +50% HP\* &amp;#x200B; Currently both sappers have 100 HP, requiring 2 hits to remove: (65+65=130&gt;100). The Redtape is interesting in concept, but consistently under-preforms and is simply outclassed by the stock sapper. By increasing the HP, thus requiring an extra hit to remove, this will grant the Rape Tape the time needed to do its job, and make it a significant competitor to the standard sapper."
270,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,"Tenth Class Idea: WARNING, QUITE LONG, AS THESE ARE NEW MECHANICS. SCROLL DOWN TO BOTTOM FOR A SUMMARY.",4,9jka4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/9jka4g/tenth_class_idea_warning_quite_long_as_these_are/,2018-09-28 15:28:50,"So...To begin, there are nine classes in Team Fortress 2. Each have unique roles to play in their teams and represent a mercenary that was hired to kill stuff. Scout-Flank and take down vulnerable targets. Cap points when the other team is not suspecting it. Pyro-Flank the team and burst down targets. Direct combat is also effective too. Soldier-Charge the frontlines, taking down multiple targets and taking the brunt of the impact. Heavy-The tankiest, gunniest, slowest class. A tanking heavy can help the team effectively cap a point, while a flanking heavy can demolish other classes. Demoman-Lay down sticky traps and demolish engineer buildings. Face-to-Face combat is also a specialty of this class with the Demoknight subclass. Engineer-Defend objectives with his sentry guns, provide support with dispensers, and get allies to the frontlines faster with teleporters. Sniper-Take out the tankiest classes with a single shot. Being one of the most effective classes in managing chokepoints and taking down unsuspecting targets. Spy-Supports the team by taking out isolated targets, destroying nests of aimbotting sentries, and generally just killing classes with one stab. Medic-Heals people and keeps then in the fight, and with a finely timed ubercharge, the tides can be swiftly and effectively turned in a matter of seconds. All of these classes have unique jobs in their team. But what do none of them have? Take a moment and think it over. No class in Team Fortress 2 has the ability to oversee the playing field, controlling troops, and throwing orders around, yet still be able to support the team with extra firepower and buffs. Introducing Mrs. Pauline, the administrative assistant. She has a wide variety of firepower, but her real strengths lie in her ability to survey the entire map with her **Radar Tracker**. The Radar is in the PDA slot of her loadout and displays a minimap view of the entire map. More on that later. Lets talk about her stats and weaponry first. **Stats:** Mrs. Pauline has a base movement speed of 115% movement speed, which, compared to the medics 105% and the scouts 133%, is fairly decent. Mrs. Pauline also has 150 base health. So flanking might be a bit of a specialty of hers although staying back and supporting teammates can also be an aspect. \-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Primary: The dart gun** Nothing too flashy, but this gun packs a punch when used in the right situations. Fires a small, electronic dart every 0.4 seconds that travels at 5,000 hammer units per second, (roughly five times faster than a grenade from a demomans grenade launcher). Each dart starts falling at 50 meters and deals 24 damage at medium range, with a 24 damage ramp-up and 10 damage falloff. So, you can see that this gun is best used in close quarters. Each clip holds 8 darts ,and the gun reloads the entire clip in 1.6 seconds. Its not just some plain old gun though, the dart gun implants a tracker on anyone it deals 60 damage to. Trackers last for 45 seconds before running out of battery and falling onto the ground. Marking the target on your HUD. Mrs. Pauline can then pull up her radar tracker and **ping** the enemy's location for the rest of the team to see. A pinged enemy is revealed(basically a red outline) to all your teammates and is also marked-for-death for 10 seconds. Pinged enemies will also reveal all other enemies around them and be indicated with a radar icon above their heads to both enemies and allies. If a teammate is pinged by an enemy, you can hit them with your melee weapon to remove the ping. Hitting Alt-Fire on your dart gun fires a special dart that consumes 4 ammo instead of 1 and reveals allies **only to you** as a wallhack and on your radar tracker for 10 seconds. Pinged allies reveal anyone in a 20 meter radius onto your radar tracker. This can help you keep track of where youre allies are and how you can notify them about impending danger. **MVM upgrades:** \-10 damage needed to track targets($250,up to 4 upgrades) \+15% firing speed($200 up to 5 upgrades) \+35% damage($400, up to 4 upgrades) \+25% ping duration($300, up to 3 upgrades) \+25% clip size($400, up to 2 upgrades) \+15% reload speed($250, up to 4 upgrades) \+10% speed boost on tracked allies($500, up to 1 upgrade) \+25 health on kill($200, up to 4 upgrades) \-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Secondary: The tracer pistol** This gun was used by Mrs. Pauline in the official SFM short Expiration date. Its a two shot pistol that fires tracer rounds at enemies. Reveals each enemy hit for 5 seconds at point blank range, 3 seconds at medium range, and 2 seconds at long range. Stacking up to 8 seconds maximum for each enemy. Revealed enemies are seen as a red outline to allies and move 10% slower for the first 1 second of being shot. Each clip holds 2 shots, reloads one bullet every 0.7 seconds, and the gun fires a 50 damage bullet every 0.7 seconds. There is a +10 damage ramp-up and only a 5 damage falloff, although reveal time is decreased based on distance. Bullets are hitscan. This gun is perfect for poking enemies from long range, but can also be used to help allies chase down enemies that have wandered into the wrong neighborhood. **MVM upgrades:** \+15% firing speed($200, up to 2 upgrades) \+15% reload speed($250, up to 4 upgrades) \+25% clip size($400, up to 4 upgrades, also increases reveal stack time) \+50% damage to bomb carrier($350, up to 3 upgrades) \-35% movement speed on revealed targets($250, up to 1 upgrade, cannot stack) \+15% damage vulnerability on revealed targets($400, up to 2 upgrades) \+25 health on kill($200, up to 4 upgrades) \----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Melee: The taser staff** A small, hand-held taser with two electrical prongs. A small burst of electricity sparks up between the prongs every time mrs. pauline stabs it forward. The weapon swings slightly faster than the any normal melee weapon(excluding scouts) and deals 50 damage(compared to the normal 65) to anyone that comes in melee range of it. Unlike other melees the weapon has a battery meter that depletes every time you SWING the weapon. The battery meter depletes in 5 swings and recharges over time. Picking up ammo boxes does not give battery to the taser. **MVM upgrades:** \+15% swing speed($200, up to 5 upgrades) \+25% max charge($200, up to 4 upgrades) Melee swings sap targets for 5 seconds($500, up to 1 upgrades) \+25 health on kill($100, up to 4 upgrades) \----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **PDA: The radar tracker** A device similar to a **contracker** that Mrs. Pauline can pull up on her screen when necessary. Once activate, if fills about 90% of the screen while Mrs. Pauline can still look around using the mouse. The contracker displays an overhead display of the entire map revealed/tracked allies and enemies as blue/red dots with the players class listed above it. The radar tracker also shows all ammo and health kits currently on the map. INCLUDING AMMO BOXES DROPPED ON DEATH AND HEALTH KITS DROPPED BY THE CANDY CANE. Tracked enemies are shown on the bottom of the radar tracker with the player name and headshot of their class. You can track up to 5 enemies and pressing each of their corresponding numbers, you ping them. Alt-Fire while your radar tracker is active to make Mrs. Pauline pull out an electronic pen, disabling you from looking around, but giving you a pointer on the minimap of the radar tracker so that you can select parts of the map or even allies/enemies to relay information to your allies. Selecting one of the four types of markers listed at the bottom of the tracker: **Safe, Help, Danger,** and **Go here**. Left mouse button on anywhere on the map will ping the location or player with the corresponding marker. All teammates will see these markers as marked on their HUD as a symbol similar to a medic arrow, and with a temporary minimap that appears in their uppermost right corner, showing nearby health packs or ammo packs. Indicating safety in one area, starting pushes, pleading for help for other teammates, and telling if an area is safe. You can also tell engineers where nearby ammo boxes dropped by dead players are. Markers have a 4 second cooldown to prevent spam and balance the weapon. The radar tracker also displays enemies and allies ONLY TO YOU in all of these situations: \-Enemies in line of sight of any other allies \-All allies at full health \-All enemies revealed with tracer pistol \-All pinged enemies **MVM upgrades:** \+25% damage resistance while deployed($400, up to 1 upgrade) &amp;#x200B; **Summary:** Mrs. Pauline offers decent firepower to the table, but her main strength lies in her ability to reveal enemies and help her team coordinate attacks better. She does this by firing her primary and ""tracking"" enemy players with her Radar Tracker(PDA slot). Tracked enemies are marked-for-death and can be seen through walls. Mrs. Pauline can also give teammates a wallhack by firing her secondary, the tracer pistol, at enemies. Mrs. Pauline's radar tracker also has the unique feature of a minimap, which Mrs. Pauline can use to ping information to her teammates. "

Dalohks Bar: A weaker sandvich in terms of healing, but if you are already at full health, eat one and you gain a temporary advantage over others in a melee brawlout. +50 health can mean surviving one more sniper bullet or one more crocket rocket. The teamwork, pushing melee heavy. Buffalo Steak Sandwich: I created this weapon partly because I wanted to bring this back into the meta. It offers full mini-crits, restores health, and can now be used as an item to burst down enemies quickly. Use to become a fully-offensive, flanky heavy. Second Banana: Gives you less health, but you have more of an opportunity to heal up, making long-term survival easy to pull off if you are being consistently dealt damage. Turns heavy into a opportunity-taking, rush heavy. Shotgun: Not as much dps as your minigun, but gives you a medium range alternative to your fists. Since you no longer have a minigun. Use to become a medium to close-range, in-your-face heavy. The Family Business: Gives you more room for error, with the increased fire rate and clip size. Become a medium to close range heavy. Now on to your melees: The Warrior's Spirit: Pair with the sandvich to increase survival, and pair with the buffalo steak sandvich to be a true terror when flanking enemies, generally a good weapon to have with this primary. The Killing Gloves of Boxing: No gun. Only fists. More speed. Crits on kill. Already in melee range. Alive enemy beside you. Punch. Punch. Dead enemy beside you. The Gloves of Running Urgently: +30% running speed paired with no health drain will make you an absolute terror to the enemy team. Use this with buffalo steak sandwich to run at a speed of 144%, which is even faster than a scout. Fat Scout you say? Heavy's been working out for this moment. The Fists of Steel: Offers a great resistance against ranged damage, allowing to get up close and start the punching. Your target might be dead before they figure out you have melee vulnerability. Fists: Good Ol' Fists. Pair with anything to make a well-rounded, punchout heavy. The Eviction Notice: More swing speed, allowing you to get comfortable with the enemy, plus, you a gain a speed boost for each hit, allowing you to chase down enemies. **Technical Stuff** ~~Where's the downside?

An interesting thing to note about this weapon's stats is that it has a 20% slower firing speed. What this does is make the player more vulnerable upon missing the first swing and makes any damage taken unnecessary during that time. However, this downside is not strong enough to increase the risk associated with using this weapon, leaving it still overpowered. By making the player take 15% more damage while the Ubersaw is held out, there is a more sufficient risk when using this weapon. This means that in casual play you have an even better shot at killing a Medic before he can land a random critical hit and in competitive play it might bring a more common usage of other melee weapons such as the Amputator.

I like to use it when I'm playing with my flanking loadout, but it is mostly useless and very situational at this point. The old Atomizer's design was better. It had a passive upside that focused on combat. This Atomizer is just for reaching places you normally couldn't reach, not for combat (I hope so at least). There's three new designs I thought of. **The Atomizer** *Level 10 Bat* ~~**Grants Triple Jump**~~ ~~**Wearer never takes falling damage**~~ ~~*Triple Jump does 20 damage to you unless you are holding it*~~ ~~*This weapon deploys 50% slower*~~ ~~*25% slower firing speed*~~ 20 damage may seem like a lot, but note that you can avoid way more than 20 damage with that third jump. It also keeps the ability of reaching pleaces you wouldn't be able to reach at first without a real downside. **The Atomizer** *Level 10 Bat* ~~**Grants Triple Jump**~~ ~~**Wearer never takes falling damage**~~ ~~*The third jump deals 10 damage when used*~~ ~~*Can only Triple Jump every 15 seconds*~~ ~~*This weapon deploys 50% slower*~~ ~~*25% slower firing speed*~~ A variation of my first idea. Simple. **The Atomizer** *Level 10 Bat* ~~When weapon is active:~~ ~~**Grants a Triple Jump while deployed**~~ ~~**Wearer never takes falling damage**~~ ~~**This weapon deploys 80% faster**~~ ~~**This weapon holsters 60% faster**~~ ~~*100% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ ~~*50% damage penalty*~~ In battle, you can quickly switch to your Atomizer for a triple jump to avoid damage. However, you take double the amount of damage when you're holding it. Probably my least favorite out of the three, but I see a bit of potential with this design. "

This weapon is straight up bad. You have to switch to it, hit an enemy, switch back to your Scattergun, and shoot. While you were doing that, you could've already shot your enemy twice with your Scattergun. It doesn't work as a support weapon nor a combo weapon for yourself. Because of that, it's both a waste of time and an unnecessary risk. There is no single reason to use this weapon but in MvM. There's a newer design I thought of. **The Fan O'War** *Level 5 Gunbai* ~~When weapon is active:~~ ~~**This weapon holsters 50% faster**~~ ~~**Alt-Fire: Summons a wave that pushes back enemies, destroys projectiles, and marks targets for death for 5 seconds**~~ ~~*It takes 10 seconds to recharge the Alt-Fire attack*~~ ~~*66% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ ~~*Increase in push force taken from damage and airblast*~~ ~~Winds of Gravel Pit~~ ~~Scout brings on his deadly fan!~~ ~~You are marked for death~~ This is basically a sort of airblast, except the knockback is weaker and the range is bigger. Projectiles don't get reflected, but rather destroyed / disabled (like the Deflector Heavy in MvM). The knockback and faster holster speed is good for when you're on your own and trying to combo. It also has more potential as a support weapon because of the range and ability to destroy projectiles. Giving the Scout some sort of airblast seems very powerful, but the downsides prevent that. You can't spam it since it has a cooldown and you also take more damage and knockback while holding it. "

He becomes amazing at dealing with spies, but terrible at dealing with everything else destroying his buildings. +75% damage means he won't one-shot light classes unless they're not at full health, or have some weapon that reduces max health. (113 damage) However, he can only swing his wrench at half the speed of a normal wrench. Since that would obviously make this wrench completely useless, it has the upside of upgrading buildings twice as fast. These two stats balance out, making upgrading buildings happen at the same speed as the stock wrench. (Twice as much metal per swing, but half as fast swinging) This weapon is probably fairly overpowered if used with a second engineer, but two or more engineers is already pretty overpowered as it is, so whatever."

This change provides the weapon with a strong upside beyond not being the candy cane. Let's move onto the other bats. **Atomizer** ~~**Grants the ability to triple jump while weapon is deployed.**~~ ~~**Melee attacks mini-crit while airborne.**~~ ~~*The weapon deploys 50% slower.*~~ Before projectile reflection being added, this weapon was preferable to the stock bat 9 times out of 10; the extra mobility was just too useful. The slower deploy speed matters far more when it hampers your ability to deal with incoming projectiles. Because of this, the damage penalty was removed as it was simply unnecessary. **Fan O'War** ~~**On hit: one target at a time is marked for death, causing all damage taken to be mini-crits for 15 seconds.**~~ ~~**Any projectiles reflected by this weapon mini crit their targets.**~~ ~~*Deals 60% less damage.*~~ ~~*Swings 35% slower.*~~ Keeping with this weapon's theme of mini crits, I thought it would be interesting to incorporate that into the reflect. I removed the weapon's trait of making mini crits into regular crits due to it being a mostly useless stat. A swing speed penalty has been added that makes reflecting a little harder in exchange for the greater reward in the form of mini crits. The weapon still retains a large damage penalty though it has been reduced by 10%. **Boston Basher** ~~**On hit: causes bleed to enemy for 5 seconds.**~~ ~~*On miss, causes self-damage and bleed to the player for 5 seconds.*~~ While no changes have been made, this weapon has been indirectly nerfed. Now when reflecting projectiles you have to take into account the bleed damage that you will suffer when you swing to do so. This forces scouts to think about how much hp they're saving by reflecting vs how much they're losing from the swing. If the weapon seems a little too weak (which I doubt) then you could reduce the self bleed from 5 seconds to 3. **Sandman** ~~**Alt Fire: Launches a baseball that slows the enemy between 18 seconds, depending on distance. The baseball will recharge over 10 seconds, can be picked up from the ground after launch, or can be replenished from a resupply cabinet.**~~ ~~**Projectiles reflected by this weapon slow opponents on hit.**~~ ~~*Lowers maximum health by 15 points.*~~ This weapon seemed a little weak beforehand, an occasional slow just doesn't quite seem worth 15 hp. I'm still a little unsure if this is the right route to go with buffing this so I'm taking suggestions for this one. **Candy Cane** ~~**A small health pack is dropped when the player kills an enemy, regardless of what weapon the player was using in order to kill the enemy.**~~ ~~*Cannot reflect projectiles.*~~ Explosive vulnerability has been replaced with something that still leaves scout at a disadvantage against those classes (without being one-shot by pills.) With the ability to reflect being gone, you can no longer deal with rockets, pills, and stickies as easily. **Sun-on-a-Stick** ~~**Guarantees Critical damage on burning targets.**~~ ~~**Projectiles reflected by this weapon set opponents on fire.**~~ ~~*30% fire vulnerability on wearer.*~~ ~~*Deals 35% damage.*~~ This weapon now has a way to enable its own crits. Because of the potential reliability of this I've nerfed the reward a little bit. Even though you can now burn opponents yourself, using this in conjunction with a friendly pyro is still incentived due to the greater need to be extinguished. **Wrap Assassin** ~~**Alt-Fire: Launches a festive ornament that shatters causing bleeding on direct hit and explodes hurting everyone close to the explosion.

290,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,Defense Class Balance Changes,10,94idgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/94idgx/defense_class_balance_changes/,2018-08-04 21:06:36,"G'day everyone. This is my list of changes and reworks for the defensive classes' weapons. The changes aim to make the weapons more balanced, more fun (for both user and victim) and have distinct roles and playstyles. Changes marked with an (I) are purely cosmetic changes that 1) are QOL changes, 2) improve visual feedback or 3) are just for fun. This should be a shorter post than my others since Demo's arsenal is well-balanced, Heavy doesn't have that many weapons and Engie is in both categories. However, it is still a very long post. # Demoman Weapons **Loch 'n' Load** (+) mini-crits targets launched into the air by explosives and airblast (+) 25% damage bonus vs buildings (from 20%) (+) 20% faster draw speed (-) clip size reduced to 2 pills (-) 20% damage penalty (-) -35% explosion radius (from 25%) (-) grenades shatter after being in flight for 1 second This weapon seems to not have a specific role, is somewhat of a crutch and defies the laws of physics and common sense. I've attempted to fix problems 1 &amp; 3 (and possibly problem 2 as well) by reducing the clip size and adding some new stats. My second rework of this weapon aims to make it a tool to protect yourself from Scouts and flankers in exchange for spamming capabilities. The faster projectile speed allows you to hit fast-moving enemies better and the mini-crit on airshot (a stat taken from the weapon that this was originally inspired by, the Direct hit) is to reward the Demo for airshots and allow him to kill enemies with more than 160 hp ('cause of the damage penalty) with 1 clip if he is able to launch them into the air with 1 grenade and airshot them with the other. The damage penalty, increased clip size and increased blast radius penalty make the weapon worse at prolonged combat and teamfights, with the damage penalty specifically also being there to compensate for the faster projectile speed leading to easier-to-hit shots. I originally wanted to remove the damage bonus vs buildings, but I kept it (and buffed it slightly) to allow the weapon to still 1-shot minis. ***** **B.A.S.E Jumper** (+/-) air control with the parachute active will work differently: * W and S keys cause the user to slowly accelerate and decelerate (max speed of about 320 Hu) * A and D keys do nothing whatsoever * the user can slowly turn in midair by turning the mouse (+) the parachute automatically deploys when about 70Hu if you would otherwise take falling damage (+) re-add updraft when on fire The weapon is banned in 6s because the air control allows the soldier to more easily dodge airshots and because it makes bombs easier (which is the whole point of the weapon, to be fair). However, it isn't particulary good in pubs, even with the air strike. I originally wanted to simply remove air control entirely and add the anti-fall damage stat as compensation, but I found this idea from u/Nate667 and decided it was the best I've seen, so I added it. It addressed the issue without destroying the weapon, made it more interesting and actually made thematic sense, whereas most other proposed BASE jumper changes don't. I added the updraft back because it sounded fun and I have absolutely no idea why it was removed in the first place. &gt;Fun fact: this weapon appeared in a blog post of weapon concepts that Valve didn't like (called ""the Mann Co. Factory Floor""). Other things on the list were a vacuum for the pyro and a sticky launcher with a single, super-powerful stickybomb. &gt; &gt;Also, is there anyone that actually uses this on Demo??? ***** **Quickiebomb launcher** (+) increased clip size to 6 (+) stickies are not affected by the radius ramp up introduced in Love &amp; War (+) reload speed increased by 20% (-/+) damage penalty changed to 30% smaller blast radius (-) damage increase from charging only applies to airdet stickies This weapon sees little use because the clip size nerf counters most of the upsides and stock is generally more consistent. These changes should hopefully make the weapon more useful. ***** **Scottish Resistance** (+) stickies will only be detonated beneath the Demo's feet when airborne This is just a QOL change to prevent demos accidentally detonating stickytraps underneath them. If you were disappointed due to the lack of actual buffs, It's because I think the weapon is a fine sidegrade in pubs and is just vastly underrated. Something that might help it in comp, though, would be a primary focused on spam that could make up for the lack of stickyspamming. I once saw a suggestion to give the stock 6 grenades but reduce the damage to 80 and I think that would be quite useful alongside the ScotRes. ***** **Eyelander (probably an unpopular change)** (-) remove headtaking mechanic (+) add 'blood rage' buff for 3 seconds on kill * The buff provides: * faster movespeed * minicrits for the sword * 10 health regenerated/second * It causes Demo's eye socket to glow green (just like collecting heads currently does) I dislike weapons that reward you for kills with more killing power, and that includes the three headtaking weapons. While the eyelander is not really OP, it has no downside once the Demo racks up 2 kills (unless you count the 50% slower draw speed) and is able to gain Soldier HP and somewhere between Medic and Scout speed at 4 kills, which can be quite ridiculous when paired with explosives. This rework was inspired by Spy's big earner. The buff allows Demo to get chains of kills in quick sucession, or can be used to make a quick escape after a pick. ***** **Pain Train** (+) while active, 20% faster movement speed while carrying the intel briefcase, australium briefcase or PASS time jack (+) 50% more healing from payload carts while active (-) capture rate bonus only applies while active (-) bullet vulnerability increased to 15% This weapon isn't really unbalanced, but is not particularly interesting, is useless in 60% of games and does not ever require the user to pull it out to get the upside. My changes make it more useful in more gamemodes (granted, all these gamemodes are horrible) but forces the user to actively use it to get the benefit. &gt;This is a multi-class weapon but unlike most of the others, the slot it goes in has different value for both classes it goes in. Soldier's stock melee is a strong contender for worst weapon in the game whereas demo's stock melee is the meta and his melee slot actually has a purpose. This makes it fairly difficult to ensure that the weapon is balanced for both classes ***** **Ullapool Caber** (+) mini-crits while blast jumping or shield charging (both the hit and explosion) (+) draw time changed from 200% to 150% (same as swords) (I) add the 10% damage penalty to the description (I) make 'first hit creates an explosion' a positive stat (the weapon appears to have none atm) These changes add some use to this meme weapon by taking a stat from the beloved market gardener. The caber would become a situational tool for 'bombing' as a demoman with the sticky jumper, and in medieval could be used to become a human sentry buster with a shield. If I'm not mistaken, a minicrit explosion + a minicrit melee should be able to 1-shot a light class. Please note that this might make 9/11 re-enactment a somewhat viable strategy. ***** # Heavy Weapons (guy) **All Miniguns** (+) Heavy now moves at 45% speed while revved up, up from 37% speed (brass beast heavies now move at 27% speed, up from 15%) (+) Heavy can swap to anything that isn't food during the minigun's unrev animation (+/-) 10% smaller cone of fire (-) 10% slower firing speed These changes make the Heavy more powerful on offense. ***** **Natascha** (+/-) replace slowdown on enemies with speedboost on the heavy on hit (30% if the enemy is within 512 Hu, ramping down to 10% if the enemy is at 1024 Hu, and nothing beyond that) (+) spinup penalty reduced to 15% (-) removed the resistance This weapon was originally created to give heavy a way to stop people running from him. When the result was, however, was an anti-scout and anti-bomber weapon that was unfun and resulted in its ban. This change allows the weapon to do what it was originally intended to do somewhat, and allows heavy to be more mobile during combat, at the cost of DPS. I imagine that by adding some mobility to the heavy, that this weapon would become more fun for both the user and victims. ***** **Brass Beast** (+) resistance now always applies when spun up * The resistance doesn't apply to critical attacks, so a fully overhealed heavy can still die in 1 hit from a headshot (+) 75% knockback resistance while spun up (-) 10% faster spinup (compared to current version) (-) change 20% damage boost to 25% faster firing speed (-) 15% less accurate This weapon sucks because it makes the class most in need of mobility even less mobile in exchange for somewhat less useful (but by no means bad) upsides. I didn't want to simply tone down the downsides, since Heavy has very little diversity in playstyles as it is and making an unlock more bland is not going to help that. Instead, I made the weapon better at its job by making the damage resistance passive and adding knockback resistance, which make a well-positioned Heavy even harder to remove (and could also make Heavy better at pushing). To counter that, I added an accuracy penalty and faster ammo drain to force the Heavy to position himself well or risk running out of ammo and getting swarmed. ***** **Huo-Long Heater** (+) ring of fire is 2x as wide and 2.5x as high (+) ring of fire does 2x damage (24/tick, from 12/tick) (+) Heavy moves 20% faster when revved up (+) ring of fire is now toggleable with the R key (switching modes takes 0.4 seconds and causes the weapon's barrel to adjust itself so that the holes are open when the ring is active) (-) ring of fire consumes 2x as much ammo (-) no ammo gained from dispensers and payload carts while revved up (-) damage penalty increased to 15% (I) ring of fire has its own kill icon (I) the holes in the barrel now glow when the ring is active This 'Oriental dumpster-fire' of a weapon is often considered Heavy's worst minigun (or at most, just above the brass beast). It chews through bullets faster than hoovies chew through sandviches and has fairly useless upsides. My redesign aims to make the weapon an offensive beast that allows the Heavy to rush/ambush enemies and murder them with the fire + boosted minigun bullets. The ring of fire has most of its stats doubled to make it more dangerous for both victims and heavy. The ring is now toggleable so that it works like a regular minigun most of the time, but the heavy can activate fire mode when something gets into close range. The inability to collect ammo from dispensers is to prevent the Heavy from just camping dispensers/riding the cart and encourage him to actually rush enemies. ***** **Panic Attack** (+) 20% faster firing speed (-) accuracy slowly ramps down rather than resetting instantly when the user stops firing (takes 0.8 seconds to recover fully from 1 shot ) (-) maximum shot pattern after firing all 6 shots is now 15% larger (I) crosshair expands and contracts to show accuracy (like the amby) This weapon has low accuracy and less consistency at longer ranges, in exchange for a whopping 18 accuracy at point blank. I've decided to improve the weapon a little at its role of close quarters combat with a firing speed boost, while reducing the accuracy if the user simply fires as fast as possible. The user now has to moderate speed and accuracy to ensure maximum DPS at whatever range they are fighting from (at least that was the idea). These stats were taken from my offense class post and were balanced around Solly and Pyro specifically. This may not necessarily be balanced on Heavy. ***** **Buffalo Steak Sandvich** (+) heals 100hp on consumption (+) the weapon's effects will last only as long as heavy has his melee out (+) the buff grants 25% faster swing speed (-) the weapon spawns empty and needs to be charged (20 seconds or 300 damage) The weapon is banned because it allows a heavy to run to mid (and have the FoS + full health while doing so). I originally wanted to make the speedboost dependent on damage taken, but I changed it to this to avoid weakening the weapon at its intended role. The 2 buffs are to make it slightly better than currently at its intended role: heavyzerker. &gt;This weapon is in the odd place of being banned in comp, but trash outside of it. The old vita-saw , the B.A.S.E jumper, the bonk and possibly the mantreads and solemn vow to some degree are in this position as well. ***** **Eviction Notice** (+) removed health drain (+) 35% faster weapon switch (-) 20% damage vulnerability while active (-) -25% primary ammo (-) +15% lunchbox cooldown time This weapon has been a really bad stock fists from the uber update to gun mettle, a GRU-lite from gun mettle to JI and a really bad GRU-lite from JI to now. These changes should make the weapon much less bland and give it a unique role: a utility for a shotgun-wielding heavy. The faster switch speed allows the heavy to reposition faster after slaughtering a group of enemies, draw a shotty faster or recover faster after nomming a sandvich (why would you use this with a sandvich though?). The speedboost still exists though, allowing the heavy to move around faster without needing the GRU. The health drain penalty has also been reverted, making the weapon more useful than the GRU for short dashes, and making it better for JoJo meming. u/[AoiHono-BlueFlame](URL pointed out to me that the stats on the previous suggestion did not in any way encourage using a shotgun, so I have changed the downsides. The two bottom downsides discourage using lunchboxes and increase reliance on the shotgun. Both of them also do not impact fat scouts at all. Alternatively, I could switch the faster switch speed for 20% faster shotgun reload speed, to make the primary upside actually benefit shotguns specifically. &gt;I've noticed that this weapon has stats that make it similar to Scout's bat in combat, which is fitting because I am reworking it to a fat scout utility. ***** **Warrior's Spirit** idea 1 * (+/-) downside changed to 'Honourbound' from the Half-Zatoichi * (I) the claws will have blood on the tips after a kill Idea 2 * (+/-) Downside changed to: * (-) 20% slower draw and holster speed * (-) 5 health drained per second while active The aim here is to make the weapon not suck and make it a fun and slightly memey sidegrade/minor upgrade for medieval mode and general fooling around. The second idea is meant to be used primarily in conjunction with the steak, since it allows you to go on large killing sprees under the steak buff, but punishes you for every second you spend not killing things. I suggested it since the katana has honourbound because it's a duelist's weapon, whereas the spirit is a 'run around and massacre things' weapon and needs an appropriate downside that punishes you for not doing that. ***** # Engineer Weapons **Buildings** (+) buildings redeploy 20% faster (+) buildings construct 15% faster (+) dispensers have a 50% range increase (-) engies are 33% less effective at repairing other engies' buildings These changes improve engie's offensive capabilities while reducing the power of engie stacking in pubs ***** **Rescue Ranger** (+) bolt repairs no longer cost metal (-) bolt healing now has falloff (60hp/bolt within 512 Hu to 33% healing or 20hp/bolt at 1024 Hu) This weapon is banned in 6s because it allows an engie to repair his sentry from the safety of cover (or spawn). The JI change didn't really address that, so I've added this change, suggested by [u/Nation\_Builder](URL instead. It forces the engie to stand vaguely near the thing he's healing in order to heal it quickly under fire, while still allowing him to maintain buildings from a distance reasonably well. ***** **Pomson 6000** (+) 50% faster projectile speed (+) damage only falls off to 75% rather than 50% (+) shots now penetrate enemies (-) removed uber and cloak drain The current weapon is both crap and rather annoying for enemy meds and spies so I instead reworked it into a longer-range spam tool that allows the engie to shoot people from cover, at the cost of personal defense. This idea was created with the help of [u/Nation\_Builder](URL ***** **Panic Attack** *See Heavy changes* ***** **Wrangler** (-) The shield can now only tank a certain amount of damage before it collapses, displayed on the engie's HUD in a bar (the shield's energy is 100 damage for minis, 133 damage for lvl1s, 166 damage for lvl2s and 200 damage for lvl3s). The shield will slowly regenerate at a rate of 20 damage/second (10 seconds to fully recharge) when the sentry is in automatic mode. Only damage blocked directly by the shield (ie, not dealt to the sentry) will drain its energy. * The shield's visual effect will flicker as the shield weakens, and will produce brightly-coloured sparks for a second when the shield is destroyed to provide visual indicators to enemies. (I) add a MvM upgrade called +100 shield energy for $350 (+) The engie takes 35% less damage from his sentry while the wrangler is active. This weapon made engie really good at last holds and is much better than the pistol (at least when there are no spies). This version may still be a little strong, but it's better balanced than the current version, since the shield can now be drained through focus fire. The second stat is to encourage engineers to use sentry jumping as an actual tactic. ***** **Short Circuit** (+/-) remove current primary fire and move the orb attack to primary fire (+) orbs now do 50 damage on hit (I) orbs now have the primary fire's kill icon (I) the weapon's stats in the description are now: * (+) Launches projectile-consuming energy balls * (-) uses 65 metal per shot * (-) no random crits * (-) cannot be crit boosted This weapon is pretty fine. I've just removed the completely useless primary fire, tidied up the stats and buffed the damage a tad. The weapon is the most well-balanced and by far the most fun its ever been IMO. ***** **All Wrenches** (-) 35% damage penalty vs sappers on other engies' buidings * all wrenches take 1 extra hit This change reduces the power of engie stacking in pubs a little ***** **Southern Hospitality** (+/-) replace all stats with the following * (+) 100% damage bonus against buildings * (+) on hit: bleed for 5 seconds * (-) 25% explosive damage vulnerability on buildings This is perhaps the most bland thing in engie's arsenal. It has an upside that doesn't do much combined with mostly irrelevant downsides. This rework enhances the wrench as a spy counter while reducing his ability to withstand pushes. (this way, 1 counter is negated while another is strengthened) # A random idea **Bonk! Atomic Punch** (+) Recharge time reduced by 4 seconds (+) max strength slowdown effect reduced to 50% (-) Scout takes 50% more knockback from explosives and airblast This was a change I thought of for the bonk while writing this post up. The weapon is banned in 6s because it gives the Scout a free flank, but is extremely situational and sees little use in pubs. My changes here make the Scout easier to shut down if someone manages to hit him with explosives, but make the weapon more effective as a tool to escape danger. ***** Thanks for reading and I hope you liked it :)"

It's supposed to be a weapon to keep enemies that are too close away from you. It's pretty much what a melee weapon is supposed to be like. It'd work pretty much on every class, even (somewhat) Engineer and Spy. Engineer would be able to push back Spies and if you might be able to escape easier when you miss your backstab as a Spy. The knockback effect wouldn't be too extreme. It'd push enemies far enough and a bit into the air. To balance it out, the knockback's effectivity would depend on the class you're playing as. Heavy, Medic and Engineer would have the strongest effect because they need it the most. The Engineer is already crippling himself by using this as a Wrench. Spy and Sniper have a slightly weaker knockback effect. Scout, Soldier, Pyro and Demo have the weakest knockback effect out of them all because they all don't need it that much. I know that this is vague, but if I were to be more precise it'd get too technical. Also, don't ask me how you can build and backstab with a crowbar. Engineer can build with a knife and Spy can backstab with a statue. It's hard to come up with a melee weapon design for this thing, so I thought of a crowbar."
295,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[IG] Multiclass balance changes v3 part 2,3,8uhw67,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/8uhw67/ig_multiclass_balance_changes_v3_part_2/,2018-06-28 20:06:40,"Yesterday, I released the 1st part of this thread, covering scout to demoman. This second post covers the support classes (and heavy). Version 2 of this focused on the 6s banlist. Every weapon here is banned unless otherwise stated. However, while I believe that weapons should be balanced at the highest level of gameplay, stuff shouldn't be reworked/nerfed just for the sole purpose of getting it off the banlist (the best example of this I can think of for this is the GRU, although it deserved its rework IMO.) I think that, in addition to being balanced, items should 1) be fun to use and fight 2) have a specific identity/role in the class's arsenal and 3) force the class to exchange something to get something else (eg. the gunboats increase mobility at the cost of sustained combat capability). At various points, I will add some commentary on Valve's intentions with specific weapons. Now that I've run out of random things to put here, let's start... (Warning: This is a long post) \*\*\*\*\* # Heavy Weapons \*\*All Miniguns\*\* (+) While the minigun is revving down, the heavy can now swap to any weapon that isn't food (although I might make an exception for the steak sandvich) (+) While revved up, heavy now moves at 45&amp;#37; speed, up from 37&amp;#37; speed (brass beast heavies now move at 27&amp;#37; speed, up from 15&amp;#37;) (+/-) 10&amp;#37; smaller cone of fire (-) 10&amp;#37; slower firing speed These changes are mostly to make heavy faster, more dynamic and hopefully more fun. The increased accuracy both increases the mechanical skill ceiling a little (hopefully) and makes the heavy slightly more threatening at longer ranges. The firing speed penalty is meant to compensate somewhat for the heavy's increased mobility. \*\*\*\*\* \*\*Natasha\*\* (\\-) Remove the slowdown (\\-) remove the damage resistance (\\+) Add a 1 second speedboost on hit (same strength as my version of the DA if the enemy is within 512 Hu, almost nothing if the enemy is at 1024 Hu, and nothing beyond that) This weapon was originally created to give heavy a way to stop people running from him. When the result was, however, was an anti-scout and anti\\-bomber weapon that was unfun and resulted in its ban. This change allows the weapon to do what it was originally intended to do somewhat, and allows heavy to be more mobile during combat, at the cost of DPS. I imagine that by adding some mobility to the heavy, that this weapon would become more fun for both the user and victims. \*\*\*\*\* \*\*Buffalo Steak Sandvich\*\* (\\+) heals 100hp on consumption (\\+) the weapon's buffs will last as long as heavy has his melee out, but the heavy is still locked to melee for 8 seconds (\\-) the weapon spawns empty and needs to be charged (30 seconds or 300 damage) The weapon is banned because it allows a heavy to run to mid (and have the FoS \\+ full health while doing so). i originally wanted to make the speedboost dependent on damage taken, but I changed it to this to avoid weakening the weapon at its intended role. The other 2 changes are to make it slightly better than currently at its intended role: heavyzerker \*\*\*\*\* \*\*Eviction Notice (Not on the banlist)\*\* (\\-) removed health drain while active (\\+) add 35&amp;#37; faster weapon switch speed on wearer (-) 20&amp;#37; less primary ammo on wearer This weapon has been a really bad stock fists from the uber update to gun mettle, a GRU-lite from gun mettle to JI and a really bad GRU-lite from JI to now. These changes should make the weapon much less bland and give it a unique role: a utility for a fat scout. The faster switch speed allows the heavy to reposition faster after slaughtering a group of enemies or recover faster after nomming a sandvich. The speedboost still exists though, even though the health drain and and old damage vulnerability has been removed. I think this is balanced mostly out by the passive downside of 40 less minigun ammo, however. \*\*\*\*\* # Engineer Weapons \*\*Rescue Ranger\*\* (\\+) No longer takes metal to heal buildings (\\-) healing on sentry guns has falloff (healing reduced depending on distance starting from 512 Hu, with a minimum of 30 Hp/bolt beyond 1024 Hu) This weapon is banned because it allows an engie to repair his sentry from the safety of cover (or spawn). The JI change didn't really address that, so I've added this change, suggested by u/Nation_Builder, instead. It forces the engie to stand vaguely near the thing he's healing in order to heal it quickly under fire, while still allowing him to maintain buildings from a distance reasonably well. \*\*\*\*\* \*\*Pomson 6000 (Not on the banlist)\*\* (\\+) 50&amp;#37; faster projectile speed (\\+) damage only falls off to 75&amp;#37; rather than 50&amp;#37; (\\+) shots now penetrate enemies (\\-) removed uber and cloak drain The current weapon is both crap and annoying for meds and spies so I instead reworked it into a longer-range spam tool that allows the engie to shoot people from cover, at the cost of personal defense. This idea was created with the help of u/Nation_Builder. \*\*\*\*\* \*\*Wrangler\*\* (-) The shield can now only tank 200 damage before it collapses, displayed on the engie's HUD in a bar. The shield's visual effect will slowly fade as the shield weakens, and will produce brightly-coloured sparks for a second when the shield is destroyed to provide visual indicators to enemies. The shield will slowly regenerate at a rate of 20 damage/second (10 seconds to fully recharge) when the sentry is in automatic mode. Only damage blocked directly by the shield (ie, not dealt to the sentry) will drain its energy. (+) The engie takes 35&amp;#37; less damage from his sentry while the wrangler is active. This weapon made engie really good at last holds and was much better than the pistol (at least when there are no spies). This version may still be a little strong, but it's better that the current version, since the shield can now be drained through focus fire. The second stat is to encourage engineers to use sentry jumping as an actual tactic. \*\*\*\*\* # Medic Weapons Please note that I'm not qualified to balance the medi-guns. Everything here is unbanned \*\*All Syringe Guns\*\* (+) reload when not active (+) 25&amp;#37; faster projectile speed The syringe guns are all overshadowed by the crossbow right now. While part of the problem is the fact that the crossbow is a little OP, the syringe guns are also weak, unsatisfying to use and not as skill-intensive. These changes make syringes a little more reliable and hopefully a little more fun. \*\*\*\*\* \*\*Blutsauger\*\* (+/-) replace current downside with ""50&amp;#37; less healing from healthpacks"" (+) add ""Blood transfusion"" mechanic: \+ each hit with the weapon drains the enemy's blood, adding 1 point to a ""blood"" counter on the medic's HUD, to a max of 40 \+on alt fire: spend 20 blood to spray an energy beam at a nearby teammate that grants a teammate a buff that heals 75 health over 3 seconds (25 health/second) This idea is probably stupid and needs some balancing. I suggested it as a way to make the weapon less selfish and more supportive without adding mad milk syringes (because mad milk is really strong). This rewards the medic for dealing damage with crossbow-ish burst healing on targets. However, since I've nerfed mad milk (30&amp;#37; healing down from 60&amp;#37;), it could be possible to add mad milk syringes without making this weapon OP. \*\*\*\*\* \*\*Overdose\*\* (+/-) replace the speed boost with ""alt fire: spend 20&amp;#37; uber to gain a speedboost (same strength as my version of the DA) and increased air control for 3 seconds"" (-) increase damage penalty to 30&amp;#37; This weapon is just really bland. To fix that, I've made the upside into an active one that has a greater effect and strengthened the downside a little. The speedboost and air control (this is to escape being juggled) allow the medic to run out of a bad situation but in order to do so, he has to sacrifice some uber, ensuring that the medic can't just escape pursuers for no cost. \*\*\*\*\* \*\*Crusader's Crossbow\*\* (-) healing is now has its own version of crit heals (heals 50&amp;#37; of what it would now if the target was injured in the last 5 seconds, which slowly ramps up to 100&amp;#37; over another 5 seconds) (-) no uber building (-) 20&amp;#37; slower reload (+/-) removed ""no headshots"" stat (why the hell is it there?) This weapon has recieved so many buffs since its release. Previously, it lacked backpack reload, had a reload time of 1.2 seconds and lacked uber building. It was used in comp only about 1/2 the time (the overdose was used most of the other 1/2 of the time) and medic had some more diversity in his loadouts. There are also apparantly some sick frag clips of syringe gun meds in comp (although I haven't seen any yet). For whatever reason, the weapon was continually buffed since then and is now far better than the syringe guns due to all that utility (and is even pretty decent at doing the syringe guns' job). I think that the weapon needs to be toned down so that it loses some of the utility but remains mostly as useful as it is now. In my opinion, the addition of the backpack reload was the largest buff to the weapon because previously, the med could only reasonably fire 1 arrow during a battle, whereas now the crossbow is ready whenever he needs it. I don't think that this should be removed, partly because I'm adding backpack reload to all primaries and partly because it encouraged meds to fire arrows a lot more. \*\*\*\*\* Ubersaw (-) 20&amp;#37; damage penalty This weapon, similar to the crossbow, is usually considered to be the best choice for its slot and most medics rarely use anything else. This change may not convince people to switch off the weapon, but it will make it harder for the medic to actually defend himself, adding an actual, somewhat meaningful downside to the weapon \*\*\*\*\* Solemn Vow (This is actually on the banlist)\*\* (-) downside only applies while active (-) enemies can also see the medic's health while active (-) no longer able to see enemy medics' uber (+) teammates within 512 Hu can see the health of enemies the medic is looking at while the weapon is active (a floating health bar will appear above their heads) This weapon is banned because it removes the need for uber-tracking skill and almost never used in pubs because the lack of coordination means that teammates will rarely capitalize on the health-o-vision. These changes make the effect less powerful, but allow the medic to help teammates by designating enemies, in exchange for the tradeoff of revealing the medic's health to the other team. \*\*\*\*\* # Sniper Weapons \*\*All Sniper Rifles\*\* (-) quickscope damage is reduced to 30 base, 90 on headshot, which then ramps up to 50/150 in 1.3 seconds, and then the weapon acts as it does now (if I'm not mistaken, the current rifle only starts changing after 1.3 seconds) (-) zoom-in and zoom-out time increased by 50&amp;#37; (should be 0.3 seconds now) (+) sniper now has the option (on by default) to display the rifle damage near the charge bar, rather than just displaying the charge Stock sniper has remained mostly unchanged in the 11-12 years that the game has been out. During this time, however, players have gotten better and maps have gotten larger, resulting in sniper becoming more and more powerful. While Valve meant for the charge mechanic to encourage ""sniper-like behaviours"", most snipers just quickscope because quickscopes have a higher DPS than hardscoped shots and they still kill 5/9 of the roster instantly. These changes nerf quickscopes and tone down sniper's max rate of fire slightly without reducing his ability to get specific, important picks to much. After thinking about this change a little, I've decided that it would make sniper noticeably worse at picking meds, since a quickscope currently does exactly however much damage as med has health. This change would force him to have to charge for 1.3 seconds before he could headshot kill a medic (or a funslinger engie.) \*\*\*\*\* \*\*Sydney Sleeper\*\* (\\+) change nature's call to 'scoped headshots are minicrits, increase the jarate duration on hit by 60&amp;#37; (from 1.2 - 5 seconds to 2 - 8 seconds) and reduce the cooldown of jarate by 4 seconds' (\\-) add 15&amp;#37; damage penalty on bodyshot (\\-) Jarate duration now ranges from 1.2 seconds on a quickscope bodyshot to 5 seconds on a fully-charged bodyshot (+) (hidden) scoped shots extinguish teammates, and doing so reduced the cooldown on jarate (the item) by 4 seconds This weapon is infinite range Jarate in addition to allowing you to bodyshot a med to death faster that you would be able to otherwise. The bodyshot penalty now prevents you from picking meds in 1 bodyshot and provides more incentive for hitting headshots. The reduced jarate duration on low-power bodyshot makes it harder to doom enemies with jarate since it wears of faster. However, the sniper is now once again able to get 8 seconds of jarate if he lands a fully charged headshot on anything with over 200hp. \*\*\*\*\* \*\*Classic (not on the banlist)\*\* (+) headshots while not fully charged are not minicrits (+) movespeed while charging increased to 50&amp;#37; (from 27&amp;#37; or something) The classic is a weapon so bad that even new players rarely use it because of how convoluted it is. It deals low damage unless you only ever hardscope and its only downside of an increased FoV while charging is not particularly useful IMO (although sniper is my 2nd least favorite class to play so my opinion is not particularly important.) These buffs should hopefully make the weapon more useful for a mobile rifleman that follows the team around, somewhere between a huntsman sniper and a regular sniper. \*\*\*\*\* \*\*Jarate\*\* (\\+/\\-) apply all changes to the mad milk here as well (excluding the change to the milk's effect) This allows you to mark an entire team for death at once, which is really strong when you consider how much effort it takes the sniper to get. These changes make it harder to coat lots of people, force the sniper to be more precise with his jars and forces him to actually work for it somewhat. \*\*\*\*\* \*\*Razorback (not on the banlist)\*\* (-) sniper now takes 50 damage from backstabs blocked by the shield (if this damage kills the sniper, the spy doesn't get shocked) (+) 25&amp;#37; damage resistance from behind (120 degree arc) while the shield is still intact This is an idea pinched from youtuber After Breakfast. Since I hate weapons that counter 1 specific class only (which I rant about a little below) and since the razorback is perhaps my 3rd most hated item in the game, I decided to include it. It now gives the sniper slightly more protection from flankers that aren't backstabbing spies, but makes the shield worse at its primary role, which gives spies more reason to stab the shield, which in turn makes strange razorbacks and the regeneration added in JI more important (if only slightly so). The damage resistance will allow sniper to survive 3 revolver shots or possibly an amby headshot + bodyshot unless the spy stood sufficiently close. \*\*\*\*\* \*\*Darwin's Danger Shield (not on the banlist anymore)\*\* (+) re-added +25 max hp (-) reduced fire resistance to 20&amp;#37; (from 50&amp;#37;) This weapon now only counters 1 specific class much like the razorback does, but unlike the razorback, the class this weapon counters is one that will rarely ever kill you and mostly serves as an annoyance. Youtuber and pyro main Minty Coffee hates this weapon because it is now simply a ""crutch"" (I disagree somewhat) that assists snipers against the worst class in the game and does nothing else. This change brings the weapon closer to its original design and makes it worse against pyros but better against everyone else. This weapon was probably originally designed for frontline snipers who expect to be shot at a fair bit, since its only stat on release was the health increase. However, I find it to be a strange addition to a support sniper set (the other weapons in the set were the sleeper and the bushwacka). It's moved away from that design to become an anti-countersniper and then an anti-pyro weapon designed to counter 1 specific enemy class. I generally dislike weapons meant to counter specific classes (although that's probably because I'm a spy main and about 1/2 of these weapons are anti-spy), so I returned the weapon back to its original design. I imagine that this could be decent with the huntsman and the bushwacka suggestion below. \*\*\*\*\* \*\*Bushwacka (Not on the banlist)\*\* (\\-) remove 'crits when it would otherwise minicrit' (\\+) add 25&amp;#37; damage bonus (\\+) add 40 health on kill The last member of the jarate sniper set is not banned in 6s (or highlander), but I still think it deserves a change. This rework changes it from a combo weapon that requires you to take 1 specific unlock and can 1-shot almost anything to a finisher for combat\\-focused snipers. \*\*\*\*\* # Spy Weapons Please note that spy no longer has anything on the banlist (yay!) and most of the following weapons are either UP or broken IMO \*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*Disguises (not technically a weapon but whatever)\*\* (+) Disguised spies are no longer effected by Valve wallhacks (+) When disguised as a teammate (and only as a teammate), spy can press the reload key to make the disguise's weapon appear to fire (but do no damage and have no knockback, like jumper weapon shots) (+) Fix the bugs (headless pyros, legless demos, disguses missing items, engies holding ambassadors) The first change prevents spies being exposed by the wallhacks given to newly-spawned players. They allow people to check for spies disguised as them or dead teammates, for multiple people with the same name and for spies lurking around the spawn. The second change just adds a little use to friendly disguises. People have suggested alternate disguise kits (how would that work? The disguise kit does not have a slot on the loadout screen) that allow spies to fire blanks but those would simply make people spycheck more. Restricting that ability to friendly disguises and adding it in allows spies to disguise as teammates to pretend to participate in combat or (in more coordinated environments) act as a body double for a teammate. This is just a small and situational buff to disguises that may not have much effect on anything. \*\*\*\*\* \*\*Ambassador\*\* (\\+) Toned down the headshot damage falloff (deals full damage up to 700 Hu, and then damage falls off to half at 1200, after which it only does minicrit damage on headshot) (\\+) removed the damage penalty (\\-) add 20&amp;#37; faster cloak drain rate Prior to JI, I've only met 3 people who complained about this weapon, but after the changes were announced, people were coming out of nowhere slamming this weapon and its users, and I find that to be very strange. Initially I insisted that Valve revert it but after some research, I've decided that it deserved a change (although the JI one was a but harsh) The amby had 3 problems: low counterplay, stepped on sniper's toes and has no real downside compared to stock other than 'high skill floor'. These changes should hopefully fix all of these: faster cloak drain makes the spy easier to pin down and forces him to give something up in exchange for headshots and the damage falloff prevents spy from sniping, while still giving him a decent effective range. I removed the damage penalty because I considered it unnecessary now and added minicrit on long range headshot so that those who spent 1000s of hours practicing on this thing can at least get some reward for their investment. It was pointed out to me before, however, that this could make the amby too good at picking meds, since he can now 2-shot a medic from anywhere within 700 Hu (and perhaps beyond that). Do you think that that will be a problem? \*\*\*\*\* \*\*Diamondback\*\* (\\-) no longer stores crits from sapping or stabbing (\\-) damage penalty increased to 20&amp;#37; (\\+) has 3 seconds of minicrits on backstab (\\+) damage penalty only applies to non-crit and non-minicrit shots Strangely, quite a few people who complained about the ambassador also believed this weapon to be fine, since it encouraged spies to be spies rather than mini-snipers. However, while the amby rewarded you for skill, this rewards you for farming the other team's jose.gonzales.2004. My goal here was to make this into a more agressive, gun version of the kunai. It gives you a temporary damage boost on backstab to make it easier to fight your way out after a pick, but the damage penalty makes it harder to defend yourself after getting caught or flubbing a stab. However, this may potentially be too good with the kunai, since spy gains the health of the soldier and the power of the scout for a few seconds after each stab \*\*\*\*\* \*\*Invis Watch &amp; Cloak 'n' Dagger\*\* (\\+) enemies beyond 350Hu will not hear your decloak noise This change makes it easier to sneak up on players with their volume turned up or who have a modified decloak sound, without removing the sound itself. \*\*\*\*\* \*\*Dead Ringer\*\* (\\+) now gains cloak from ammo boxed and dispensers, even while cloaked (but the amount is reduced by 60&amp;#37;) (\\+) damage resistance from the hit that triggers the ringer increased to 80&amp;#37; (+) the spy now appears dead on the scoreboard and HUD to enemies until he either decloaks, or dies and respawns (\\-) speedboost and fire resistance now only last 0.6 seconds (\\-) increased damage resistance and flicker\\-proof cloak now only last 1.5 seconds (\\-) cloak will now be drained if the spy takes damage while cloaked (100 damage to drain the meter) My goal here is to make this a powerful escape option if (and only if) the spy can outsmart his pursuers. The speedboost and fire resist are now only long enough for the spy to quickly dash to cover or out of a pyro's range and after that, he becomes more vulnerable. If he manages to escape without being exposed, he can charge the ringer up again using ammo and get back in whereas if he gets caught again, his cloak will drain and he will die. According to some spy players I met in r/truetf2, the pre-gun mettle DR was like a regular cloak that allowed the spy to tank a few hits, but removed his ability to cloak on demand, making it a skill-based tactical alternative for infiltration, unlike what it is now. I changed my idea according to their feedback to make it somewhat of a compromise between that version and this one. \*\*\*\*\* \*\*Wanga Prick (The YER's reskin in case you didn't know)\*\* (\\+/\\-) give it the YER's old stats This allows fans of the old YER to have it back without nerfing the weapon for everyone else. \*\*\*\*\* That concludes my post. Thanks for reading, and I hope you liked it. (but I'm expecting downvotes)"

Soldier is one that could and maybe even should be Nerfed harder. But a Simple Demoman esc Skill Tree combined with Rocket Jumping would put both Solly and Pyro at the same Skill Level. \*\*The Direct Hit\*\* \~\~Changed 25&amp;#37; Damage Bonus to: On Hit: Gain up to a 40&amp;#37; Damage Bonus Vs Players for each Direct Hit\~\~ \~\~\*Added: Damage Bonus Resets on Miss or Reload\*\~\~ Most of the time, The Direct Hit feels more like...a Crutch rather than a Skill Weapon. This Weapon is stupidly easy to use. Pyro's Airblasting you like they're supposed to? That one Engi is better than you even with your Pocket Girlfriend? Just equip this, It takes even less Skill to use. This Version would still be kinda easy, But at least it would require more skill to get that bonus, a Rocket with 40&amp;#37; More Damage is Scary if you can pull it off. \*\*The Black box\*\* \~\~Previous Stats have been Removed and Replaced With the Following\~\~ \~\~\*\*On Kill: Receive up to 100 Health based on the Percent Age of Damage you did to the Target\*\*\~\~ \~\~\*\*While Active: Debuffs Last 50&amp;#37; Shorter\*\*\~\~ \~\~\*No Overheal on Wearer\*\~\~ \~\~\*80&amp;#37; Less Health From Health Packs on Wearer\*\~\~ \~\~\*No Random Crits\*\~\~ A Complete Rework. The Clip Size Penalty is very harsh for an Upside that really only helps bad players. Not entirely a Crutch but this version would be more Skillful. You gotta kill to Heal. Why No Random Crits? Purely so we don't get a Zatoichi Situation of Getting Health you didn't deserve. \*\*The Liberty Launcher\*\* \~\~\*\*Added: 40&amp;#37; Faster Holster and Deploy Speed\*\*\~\~ \~\~\*Removed 40&amp;#37; Faster Projectile Speed\*\~\~ I believe this Launcher has always meant to be a Combo Launcher. Aka: Don't Wear the Gunboats and Equip something else. What with the Original Clip Size Penalty and Current Damage Penalty. Great with Shotguns and would be fun with the Market Gardener. \*\*The Cow\-Mangler 5000\*\* \~\~\*Added: 10&amp;#37; Slower Reload\*\~\~ A Minor Nerf, That's all it needs. It was already Useless till MyM. I'm not Bias at all cause its my Favorite Weapon in the game.....Not at all.... In all Seriousness. Its slow, but would definitely be noticeable and Encourages to us your clip well.\\ \*\*The Beggars Bazooka\*\* \~\~\*\*Removed Explosion Radius Penalty\*\*\~\~ \~\~\*Added: 15&amp;#37; Damage Penalty\*\~\~ \~\~Changed \+3 Degrees of Random Projectile Deviations to Up To \+3 Degrees of Random Projectile Deviation depending on Rockets Loaded\~\~ This is one i'm a little more hesitant. This is arguably the Soldier Weapon that requires the most skill. but at the same time can be kinda mindless and hll if used well a Straight upgrade with Infinite Clip. The Damage Penalty makes sense, but considering the Rework for Explosions i posted above this might be too much but i wasn't entirely sure. \*\*Th Air Strike\*\* \~\~\*\*Added: 25&amp;#37; Faster Projectile Speed\*\*\~\~ \~\~\*\*Removed Explosion Radius Penalties\*\*\~\~ \~\~\*Raised Damage Penalty from 15&amp;#37; to 20&amp;#37;\*\~\~ \~\~\*Added: 20&amp;#37; Slower Reload while on the Ground\*\~\~ While it needed a Small nerf, Tough Break with its Confusing Balance Decisions gave it a Nerf that makes no sense. It....Punished you for Rocket Jumping. i'm still confused about it to this day. So let's chuck that downside away and give it a more Balanced Selection of Downsides. Upping the Damage Penalty and making it reload slower encouraging Airborne play. While the Extra Clip on Kill and New Projectile Speed don't make it entirely useless on the ground. \*\*The Buff Banner\*\* \~\~\*\*Reduce damage needed to fill the meter to 500\*\*\~\~ Should it have a passive upside? Honestly anything i can think of that wouldn't completely Negate downsides, Not make sense. or would be plain to strong. So i reduced the Damage Needed \*\*The Gunboats\*\* \~\~\*Added: 10&amp;#37; Less Move Speed on Wearer\*\~\~ Weither you like to admit it or not...This Weapon needs a Slap on the Wrist. It offers a very strong upside for no real downside. Now you just have to get the most out of the Rocket Jumps cause you're gonna be even slower than Heavy. I was thinking other downsides and possibly other upsides but let's leave it to this. \*\*The Battalions Backup\*\* \~\~\*\*Damage needed to fill the meter has been Reduced to 500\*\*\~\~ \*\*The Concheror\*\* \~\~\*Increased Damage Needed to fill from 480 to 500\*\~\~ A Very minor Change. I've stated this before but i believe The Conch should be split into two banners. One Support Focused. \(Health Regen and the Health on hit increased\) and the other Mobility Focused. \(Increases your Base Speed and gives you a speed boost\). But i ralize Splitting Weapons isn't the most useful thing in regards to Stranges and all that so i very, VERY minor nerf it is. \*\*The Righteous Bison\*\* \~\~\*\*Added: If Projectile Pierces Enemies Three Times, They Ignite for 5 Seconds, Even Enemy Pyros!\*\*\~\~ \~\~\*\*Removed Clip Size Penalty\*\*\~\~ An interesting Take i don't see. but would make for, at least a fun challenge. The Original 60 Damage plus the Afterburn would add up to 100 Damage in One Shot. Not the best i realize. But hell its interesting at least. \*\*The Base Jumper\*\* \~\~\*\*Added: 25&amp;#37; Damage Resistance when Deployed\*\*\~\~ What use does this weapon have? Especially after its nerf? None honestly. I understand the nerf, But still honestly disagree with it. But i'd rather not go the revert route so since you're a stationary target. Why not make it so you take less Damage in the air? Even then i don't think this is enough but oh well for now. \*\*The Equalizer\*\* \~\~\*\*Damage has been tweaked, Starting at 40 and Capping at 120, Going up by 1 for every 2 health loss until 40 and under\*\*\~\~ I mean, its still rather weak utility wise outside of Uber Building. But its nowhere near as weak or inconsistent as it is now. \*\*The Disciplinary Action\*\* \~\~\*70&amp;#37; Longer Range now only works on Teammates , Normal Range versus Enemies\*\~\~ This Weapon is kind fine line. Its very strong and banned.....But Nerfing it too hard could be disastrous. An idea i had was losing 10 Max Health for every Speed boost which regenerates when you put it away, but that may be too much. So eh. \*\*The Market Gardener\*\* \~\~\*\*Removed 20&amp;#37; Slower Swing Speed\*\*\~\~ \~\~\*\*Added: 50&amp;#37; Faster Deploy\*\*\~\~ \~\~\*Added: 20&amp;#37; Damage Vulnerability While Active\*\~\~ \~\~\*Added: 50&amp;#37; Slower Holster\*\~\~ The Market Gardener is a Straight Upgrade. So another slap on the wrist. It wouldn't never effect those that use it. Its just One Peg down from before. \*\*The Escape Plan\*\* \~\~\*Added: 50&amp;#37; Damage Penalty\*\~\~ This Weapon is mostly Balanced, what with the Mark for Death making it high risk and high reward type of Weapon. But it still teeters a Straight Upgrade. So a Simple Damage Penalty that encourages More Escaping than diving in. Most people will possibly disagree with me. That seems to be normal here. but i wanna share anyways."

(+) Knockback on target and shooter. (+) Mini-crits on launched targets. (-) -66% clip size. So the tweaks I made were minor but noticeable enough. Firstly I added a minicrit effect which helps to increase damage if you can hit your shots good. I also removed that extra bullets but less damage which I never understood. It is a max 7 extra damage and just kind of makes it harder to deal damage at a range. Overall it's better at damage but still retains it's function. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Bonk! Atomic Punch** (+) Drink to become invulnerable for 10 seconds and heal 75 hp, gain a +25% speed boost. Cannot attack during this time. (-) Damage dealt to you under the effects will return to you after effects end at a 1:5 ratio (cannot kill you). So now the effects of bonk are a bit more useful but there's quite a harsher downside too. You have 2 extra seconds which can be pretty good, though the extra speed can be really useful for get aways and mobility. Also there's a 75 healing which gives the ability to use it for a quick heal boost. The thing is, you take damage after based on how much damage you took. That means you basically have 620 health though you can't really die. It really punishes you if you take too much damage and you have to effectively make use of it. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Sandman** (+) Alt-Fire: Launches a ball that gives you a 5 second speed boost on hit. (-) +25% damage vulnerability while active. So the Sandman is a pretty weak weapon at this point, the slowdown just isn't that effective. Instead of a debuff to the enemy, it's a buff to yourself. It still rewards you for hitting your shots, but no so it's annoying to the enemy team. Also the health penalty is gone in replacement with an active effect. It's more punishing but only applies while active so you have to be careful when using it. "

However, there is a large list of weapons that either have never been considered viable, once were viable but have since been overshadowed by other weapons, or were once overpowered and, after being nerfed, now are considered extremely weak and/or situational. In the post I will attempt to look over three weapon for each class that are considered very situational or underpowered, and attempt to either re-balance them or rework them in a way that make them useful for general play, are balance for competitive tf2 and overall fun to use. I all also include my personal reasons for the changes I present for each weapon. Some of you may disagree with some of these changes, and I am happy to discuss or clarify any issues you may have in the comment section of this post. With introduction out of the way, let us begin (also warning for long post): **Scout** &amp;nbsp; **The Shortstop** *Level 1 Peppergun* (+) Reload time has been reduced from 1.52s to 1.28s (+) Increase base damage from 12 to 15 (-) Maximum ramp-up value reduced from 150% to 120% &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: the shortstop is designed for scout who favor fighting at a distance, yet the weapon lack the damage at medium to long range to be considered superior to the scattergun at such ranges. The slow reload speed, while a remnant of a past nerf that was rightly needed, weakens the weapons ability to be effective during firefights and ultimately results in player not bother to use the weapon. In order to make this weapon more usable for medium to long distance combat, I have decided to increase the base damage from 12 to 15 damage per pellet. This make it able to deal the same damage a medium range as the stock shotgun, but due to the weapon inherit tighter bullet spread it should be better at range combat than any shotgun. I have also lowered it's accuracy, yet not to the same level as it was when it was OP. However, to prevent this weapon from being too effective at close range, I have also reduced the Maximum ramp-up value from 150% to 120%. This last change won't affect the weapons current damage value at close range. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Crit-A-Cola** *Level 5 Lunchbox* (=) All stat have been removed and replaced with the following: While effect is active: reload and attack rate is increased by 25%. Healing from all sources are reduced by 20% &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: The Crit-A-Cola was nerfed in the Jungle Inferno Update to better balance the weapon for both pubs and competitive TF2. While the nerf was justified, the weapon currently is scout least equiped secondary weapon. I am also of the opinion that scout, a class that already can deal a large amount of burst damage, should not be given a weapon that allows him to direct increase his burst damage, especially via on-demand minicrits. To make this weapon more viable when compared to scout other secondary weapons and to make it less likely to make it OP again (in my opinion), I have decided to exhcnage the weapons ability to give minicrits for the ability to give scouts better reload speed and fire rate by 25%. This will make it more usable for aggresive scout players who want to deal damage as quickly as possible. In exchange for this damage boost, and to make it balance for competitive, I have also included a penalty to all healing sources while the effect is active. So no, medic can't just pocket a scout using this weapon and expect him to clean house without issue. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **The Sun-On-A-Stick** *Level 10 RIFT Fire Mace* (=) Remove the stats ""+25% fire damage resistance while deployed"" and ""-25% damage penalty"" and replace them with the following: While active: immune to the effects of afterburn. If suffering from afterburn, switching to this weapon will extinguish the afterburn and players will be dealt 20% of the remaining damage of the afterburn. (Hidden attribute: can't die from the resulting damage) (-) Add the stat ""This weapon holsters 50% slower."" (-) Add the stat ""No random critical hits"" &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: this weapon was never good. It is often joked a the ""Best scout melee weapon in the game"". Even with the current stats, this weapon is not very effective when it comes to fighting pryos and surviving the resulting afterburn. Pyros will still mow you down with their primaries and the amount of afterburn damage you suffer is only reduced by 1 damage (or not at all with the degreaser). To make this weapon better when it comes to fighting pyros, I have reworked the stats so that you are immune to ALL afterburn while the weapon is active. This will allow you to retreat to safety without worrying about dying on top of a health pack or dying to a random (or non-random) flare shot. However to prevent scout from becoming immune to afterburn and dominating pyros, I have made it so that, when you extingush any form of afterburn with this weapon, you are dealt 20% of the remaining damage of the afterburn. Also I have made it so that this weapon holsters 50% slower, again to make it so that scouts can't just abuse this weapon to dominate pyros. Also I have gotten rid of the damage penalty. Have fun dealing 105 damage to burning players. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Soldier** &amp;nbsp; **The Beggar's Bazooka** *Level 1-100 Rocket Launcher* (=) The amount of projectile deviation of rockets from this launcher now depends on how many rockets are in the chamber (-) Replace ""-20% explosion radius penalty"" with a ""15% damage penalty"" &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: while the random projectile deviation is listed a one of the main penalties for using this weapon, it can actually be useful when fighting other class by making your shots unpredictable. This is especially noticeable when fighting a pyro, since they can't reflect accurately due to being unable to predict where your rockets are going. Also, due to the fact that this weapon does not have a clip, soldiers can just spam rocket without having to reload resulting in them dealing either the same or even more damage than the stock rocket launcher. To make this weapon more fair to pyros and other classes, and to prevent soldier from being immune to reflects, the random projectile deviation of the rocket from this launcher depends on how many rockets are in the chamber. If you only have one rocket, then there will be no deviation. Two rockets when 2 degrees in projectile deviation. 3 rockets in the chamber mean 3 degrees of rocket deviation. Also I have change the explosion radius penalty to a damage penalty, to punish soldier who just spam rocket instead of loading rockets into the chamber and firing. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Reserve Shooter** *Level 10 Shotgun* (=) replace the stat ""This weapon deploys 20% faster"" with the stat ""20% more accurate"" (-) Will only minicrit airborne targets if launched by wearer own explosives. Grapple hooks and rocket packs are unaffected. (-) add the stat ""No random critical hits"" &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: While this weapon may now be balance and useful, most player still don't actually use this weapon on soldier. In order to encourage soldiers to actually use this weapon, I have replaced the faster deployment speed of the weapon with a accuracy bonus. This will allow soldier to better airshot with this weapon. I have also made it so that this weapon will only minicrit targets that are launched airborne by the wearers explosions. This change is to make it more fair in competitive. I have also made it so that it can't get random crits, because it can already deal minicrits. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Equalizer** *Level 10 Pickaxe* (=) Rework the weapon with the following stat: When weapon is active: Damage and health gain from packs increases as the user becomes injured. &gt;220 Health: 0% bonus. 200 health: 0 bonus. 144  53 health: 15% bonus 52-2 health: 30% 1 health: 45% &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: This weapon was once the SOLE melee weapon for soldier. Times have change thought, and now it is overshadowed by it better brother. While most people believe the weapon should give you a damage resistance based on the main of health you have remaining, I don't think it would actually make this weapon viable. Just because you gain a 25%, 50% or more damage vulnerability doesn't change the fact that you are a low health and are using you melee weapon. You will still be one shot by most weapons. Instead, I decided to make this weapon more of a roamers best friend. While pocket soldier use the escape pain to run away from fights, this weapon allows roaming soldier who are at low health to quickly switch over to their melee and gain more health from health packs. This will allow them to be more mobile, but at the cost of having to switch to their melee to gain the effect and possible being caught with their melee out. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Pyro** &amp;nbsp; **The Phlogistinator** *Level 10 Flame Thrower* (=)All stats have been removed and replace with the following: (+) Does not require ammo (Ammo counter is replaced with a energy bar. The bar is equivalent to 100 ammo on the stock flamethrower. Bar refills after 2.5s of no use. Takes 4s to refill bar if emptied). (+) +15% damage bonus (=) Alt-fire: launches a projectile-consuming energy ball. (similar to the one on the Short Circuit. Cost 20% of your energy bar. Deals very little knock-back to enemies. Deals no damage to enemies) (-) No random critical hits. &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: the Phlogistinator is considered by many to be pyros worst weapon. This weapon, while not without skill, is increadably annoying to deal with and counter. This all comes down to the weapons ability to give pyros crits on demand. However, it ability to give pyros crits comes at the cost of being unable to airblst, which make the weapon all but worthless against teams that are coordiante and focus fire the pyro. To better balance the weapon for pubs and competitive, I have decided to rework the weapon for the ground up. Now, this weapon can not give pyro crits on demand. Instead, this weapon acts like a normal flamethrower, but with a few distinct difference. First, this weapon doesn't require ammo. Rather it uses a energy bar that is equivalent to having 100 ammo on the stock flamethrower. This bar will refill on it own, but only after 2.5s of not firing the weapon. Second, this deals 15% more damage. This bonus is here to make the weapon more effective on offense, which is kinda the exact opposite role of the current Phlogistinator which favor defensive holds. The reason it would be better on offense than defense is due to the new airblast. When you Alt-fire, you will launch a projectile-consuming energy ball. It acts very similar to the one on the short Circuit. The ball cost 20% of your energy bar. Also this ball deals very little knock-back to enemies, so it is a poor choice against uber players. Also it deal no damage and you can't reflect projectile back at players. This weapon also can't random crit. This is due to the damage bonus. It can still be crit boosted, so have fun with that. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **The Manmelter** *Level 30 Indivisible Particle Smasher* (=) All stats have been removed and replaced with the following: (+) Does not require ammo (+) Alt-Fire: Extinguish teammates for 20 health (+) Dealing damage with any primary or melee fills up a bar. Filling up the bar will increase the next shot you deal with this weapon or increase the amount of health you gain by extinguishing teammates, with the max bonus being a 400% increase. Firing or extinguishing with this weapon uses the entirely of the bar. (-) Add the stat ""No random critical hits"" &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: the Manmelter is considered the worst secondary weapon for pyro. It is a flare gun that can't crit on it own without having to extingush a teammate. This make it rather worthless in most situations, especially if there isn't a enemy pyro. To make this weapon more viable and fun to use, I have included a unique mechanic to the weapon. Now, when you deal damage with your primary or melee you will fill up a bar. Filling this bar increase you next shot with the manmelter or increase the max health you gain with the manmelter. The max bonus that can be obtained by filling the bar is 400% (meaning you can deal a 120 damage shot or gain 80 health back). Firing or extinguishing a teammate with this weapon consumes the entirely of the bar. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **The Third Degree** *Level 10 Fire Axe* (+) Add the stat ""+30% faster overheal build rate on wearer"" (-) Add the stat ""-50% health from packs on wearer."" &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: the Third Degree is a straight upgrade to the stock fire axe, but that isn't saying much. It positive of dealing damage to players connected via Medigun beams is very situational and rather useless for a class that already has a high damaging weapon for close range. This weapon need to be a utility weapon, similar to most other melee weapons. With this in mind, I decided to make this weapon kinda the polar opposite of the Back Scratcher. Medics will be able to give you overheal 30% faster than normal, which can allow you to both quickly be buffed and tank damage as long as you are above max health. In exchange for this increase in survivability with medic, you now receive less health from health packs. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Demoman** &amp;nbsp; **The Loch-N-Load** *Level 10 Grenade Launcher* (=)All stats have been removed and replaced with the following: (+) +20% damage vs players (+) Mini-crits targets launched airborne by explosions, grapple hooks or enemy attacks (-) -50% clip size (-) -25% damage vs buildings. (-) Launched bombs shatter on surfaces. &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: This weapon was once considered demomans most powerful primary. It was then nerfed, but it still hated by a large portion of the player base. The reason is due to the fact pills fired by this weapon are 25% faster, making it easier for players to hit their targets and deal 100 damage per pill. However, this weapon also has a bonus against buildings, but demos are already very effective at destroying buildings so the class doesn't really need a weapon dedicated to destroying buildings. Also the damage bonus resulting in demos being able to two shot a sentry, which is unfair to engineers who can't really counter the damage. This weapon has been reworked to be a better combat option for demos. If you can land your shots, you will now deal damage than you usually would. Also, to make this weapon more similar to the direct hit, you now also minicrit airborne targets launched by explosions, grapple hooks or enemy attack. In exchange for being a better option in combat and gaining minicrits against airborne targets, your clip size has been reduced to two pill max. Also you now deal less damage to buildings. So in exchange for being less effective against a class you are considered a hard counter against, you are more effective at general combat if you can hit your shots. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Ullapool Caber** *Level 10 Stick Bomb* (+) Explosive damage increase from 75 to 85. (+) Caber now regenerate after 30s (+) Remove the stat ""20% slower firing speed"" (-) Add the stat ""Minicrits whenever it would normally crit"" &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: this weapon is usually considered demo's version of the soldiers market gardener. Yet in its current state it is anything but. This weapon doesn't deal enough damage to be worth equiping, and once you use it you are stuck with a melee that only deals 55 damage. To make this weapon more usable for ""troll-man?"" and most players, I have increased the explosive damage from 75 to 95. Now it is guarantee to kill any low health class, but the damage is still low enough to now kill medic outright (which was a problem with the old design). The caber also now regenerates, so you are not stuck with a low damaging melee all game. Also I have made it impossible for this weapon to deal criticals, so that demo-man can't just one-shot a heavy with this weapon. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ""Heavy"" &amp;nbsp; **Huo-Long Heater** *Level 1-100 Minigun* (+) The ring of flames generated by this weapon now also heals teammates. Heal is affected by Healing ramp-up. (Teammates are healed for less while under attack, but receive more healing out of combat.) (-) Increase damage penalty from 10% to 15% (-) Remove the stat ""25% damage bonus vs burning players"" (+) Ring of fire radius is increased by 25% (+) Reduce additional ammo consumption from 4 ammo per second to 2 ammo per second while spun up &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: this minigun is heavies least used primary weapon. Even the brass beast is used more often. Players only use this weapon while playing payload, due to the payload giving players ammo while pushing it. While the ammo consumption is one of the main reason the weapon isn't use, the lack of a define role is what really causes people to not use this weapon. So for this redesign I decided to give it a define role: a supportive role. While spun up, teammates that are within you ring of fire now are healed for a small amount. The healing rate is determined by a healing ramp-up, similar to the way the mediguns and Concheror on soldier works. If they were damage 10s or less ago, they are only healed for 2H/s. After ten seconds they are healed for 4H/s. After 15s, they are healed for 6H/s. To aid in this healing process, I have increase the ring of fire's radius by 25%. I have also lowered the ammo consumption rate from 4 ammo per second to 2 ammo per second. However to balance the weapon I have also increased the damage penalty of the weapon. I have also gotten rid of the damage bonus vs burning players, due to the increase in the ring of fires radius making it more easier to light players alight. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Dalokohs Bar** *Level 1 Lunch Box* (=) Rework health mechanic of weapon: (+) Weapon now increase max health by 100. This increase disappears after 30s or is removed via damage. Max overheal is unaffected. (-) Increase recharge rate from 10s to 15s &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: The Dalokohs Bar is in a weird spot. The sandvich and Second banana outclass the weapon in its current state, but reversing it nerf will just result in heavies exploiting a glitch with the weapon to gain massive amounts of overheal. To solve both problems, I suggest that the health gain mechanic of the weapon be altered a bit. This weapon now increases heavies max health by 100 health points instead of just 50. However, to balance the fact that this weapon allows heavies to tank much more than usual, this extra health not only disappear after 30s but can also be removed via damage. Think of the extra health as armor, where it is used to absorb damage but is lost when tanking damage. I have also increase the recharge time of this weapon from 10s to 15s, to prevent heavies from continuously having 400 health. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **The Eviction Notice** *Level 10 Boxing Gloves* (-) Remove the follwoing stats: ""On hit: Gain a speed boost"", ""+15% faster move speed on wearer"" and ""Maximum health is drained while item is active"" (+) Add the stat ""Deployment time of all weapons decreased by 35%"" (-) Add the stat ""-25% slower secondary items recharge time."" &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: this weapon for the longest time has been treated as the lighter version of the GRU. While some people may like the weapon in it's current state, I think it is rather lazy to make a weapon have the same stats and role as another weapon, just weaker. So I decided to give this weapon it own role. Seeing how one of heavies main problems is his general slow play-style, I decided to make this weapon the go-to option for heavies who want to be able to quickly switch to their weapons. In exchange for this new found speed, I have made it so that, while this weapon is equipped, secondary weapons recharge 25% slower. So items like the sandvich recharge in 37.5s instead of 30s. Overall, this weapon trades team synergy for being more effective solo. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Engineer** &amp;nbsp; **Pomson 6000** *Level 10 Indivisible Particle Smasher* (-) Remove ""On Hit: Victim lose up to 10% Medigun charge"" (=) Make the stat ""Projectile cannot be deflected"" hidden. (+) Add the stat "" +40% projectile speed increase"" (-) Reduce hitbox of projectile by 25% &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: this weapon is Phlogistinator for the Engineer. Rarely useful against good players, but is still annoying to deal with. The main complains against this weapon is centered around three issues: the projectiles hit-box, it's spamability, and its ability to remove cloak and uber. While I have no issue against the weapon removing spies cloak (due to it giving the weapon a role all it's own), I do have a problem with the weapons ability to remove uber. I have decided to remove the ability to remove ubercharge from medic and reduce the hitbox of the weapons projectiles by 25%. This should make the weapon less frustrating to fight against. However, in order to make this weapon more viable when it comes to combating spies, I have decided to add the stat of ""+40% projectile speed increase"". This make it easier to land shot on players, or more specifically cloaked players. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Medic** &amp;nbsp; **The Blutsauger** *Level 5 Syringe Gun* (=) The amount of health gain on hit is now based on damage. Increase base healing on hit from 3 to 4. Healing now also gives overheal. &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: the Blutsauger, while good on paper, in practice is very weak when compared to medic other primaries. 3 health per syringe just isn't enough to keep a medic alive when retreating from other players. Also any health you do gain is easily lost if any enemy player decides to shoot you. It also doesn't help that the healing doesn't benefit you if you are already at full health. In order to make it weapon more useful when compared to medic other primaries, I have made the healing mechanic of the weapon more effective. Not only is the base healing increased from 3 to 4, the healing is also affected by ramp-up and fall-off. Hitting enemies at close range gives you 6 health point per syringe, while hitting a enemy at long range only gives you 2 health points per syringe. Also, to make this weapon better at keeping you alive, the healing you gain from this weapon can also overheal you. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **The Quickfix** *Level 8 Medi Gun Prototype* (-) Reduce Heal rate bonus from +40% to +15%. (+) Increase ubercharge rate from 10% to 20% (+) Altered weapons ubercharge effect: berCharge increases healing by 400%, grants immunity to movement-impairing effects, and increased max overheal by 70%. &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: The Quickfix is currently in a strange position. In pubs it is considered underpowerd due to it's poor ubercharge effects, while in competitive it is considered overpowered due to the healing rate bonus the weapon provides. To make this weapon balance in both game formats, I have decided to first reduce the healing bonus from 40% to 15%. This should allow teams with low players counts to counter the weapon while also retaining the weapons main upside. Also, to make this weapon more viable against other mediguns, the ubercharge gain rate of this weapon has been increased from 10% to 20%. Lastly, I have change the way this weapons ubercharge works. Now using an uber charge increases the healing rate by 400%, and increases the max overheal of players by 70%. While this value may seem extreme, it only result in players gaining 10% more overheal than usual. (example with heavy: 0.5% x 1.2 = 0.6. 300H x 1.6 = 480H). The reason for the extra overheal it to make players harder to kill with large amount of burst damage or focus fire, thereby making the quickfix's uber more powerful and useful for keeping teammates alive against a large sources of damage. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Vita-Saw** *Level 5 Bonesaw* (=) All stats have been removed and replaced with the following: (+) Collect the organs of people you hit. Each organ you gain increases your ubercharge build rate by 5%. This bonus maxes out at 4 organs or 20% increase ubercharge rate. One organ is lost per ubercharge usage. (-) All overheal given by wearer decays 25% faster &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: While in it current state the Vita-saw is better balanced than before its rework, it is still a weapon that rewards medic for dying which shouldn't really be encouraged. Instead, I think a better idea for the weapon would actually make it somewhat similar to the Ubersaw. However, instead of gaining 25% uber per melee hit, this weapon benefits medics over the long run by allowing them to build uber faster. By hitting enemies you gain a organ, and with each organ your uber charge build rate is increased by 5% for a max of 20%. This bonus does stack with other mediguns ubercharge rate bonuses. However, in order to keep medic from just having a permanent ubercharge rate bonus, popping a uber consumes a organ. I have also replaced the ""-10 max health on wearer"" penalty with a ""all overheal given by wearer decays 25% faster"" penalty. This allow medic the ability to risk going for a melee, while also making sure the downside of the weapon is constantly a factor when it comes to firefights. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Sniper** &amp;nbsp; **The Cleaner's Carbine** *Level 1 SMG* (+) Now dealing damage with your primary and melee weapon fills up the charge meter. (Damage dealt with your primary weapon is only 10% efficient when filling up the bar. EX. A 150 damage head-shot only fills up the bar by 15 points) (+) Add the stat ""25% more accurate"" &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: This weapon is quiet useful in Mann vs Machine, yet it struggles to compete with snipers other secondary weapons in other game modes. The only positive on this weapon is the charge meter, but you can only fill it up by using your secondary in close to medium combat which to a sniper, a class who is dedicated to fighting at long range, is a very risk endeavor. It doesn't help that the weapon is a SMG, meaning it suffers from a bit of bullet spread which resulting in most players missing a large portion of their shots which under the minicrit effect. I have decided to make it so that dealing damage with any of your weapons fills up your crikey meter. To prevent snipers who can land head-shots from being able to constantly refill their charge meter easily, only 10% of all damage you deal with your primary weapon is transfered as charge to the charge meter. This means dealing a 450 head-shot will only fill up the bar by 45%, which is still a lot so you are encouraged to get head-shots still. I have also decided to make this weapon 25% more accurate. This will make it easier to land your shots with this weapon while crikey mode is active, so you don't have to worry about missing most of your shots and then dying. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **The Shahanshah** *level 5 Kukru* (+) Add the stat ""+10% movement speed while active"" (-) Add the stat ""No random critical hits"" &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: no one really uses this weapon on sniper. The class isn't designed for melee combat, and it isn't wise to go around trying to melee other players while at 60 or below health. Also the damage you gain from this weapon only helps with killing medics and heavies, while the damage penalty affect all of the classes. In order to make this weapon more useful I have decided to give this weapon a utility role. Similar to the power-jack on pyro, this weapon now gives you a slight 10% speed boost while active. This speed boost, while small, can allow a sniper to get to sniping spots, run away from fights or chase down spies much easier than before. However, due to the fact this weapon increases the amount of damage it can deal base on your health, I am also adding in the stat of ""No random critical hits"". . ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Spy** &amp;nbsp; **The Enforcer** *Level 5 Revolver* (+) Remove ""+20% damage bonus while disguised"" and replace with the following: (+) While disguised: 20% damage bonus for 2 seconds upon disguise removal. (Only applies to primary) (+) 20% damage bonus vs buildings &amp;nbsp; Reason for change: even with the buff during the Blue Moon update this weapon is the least equipped secondary weapon on spy. While the damage bonus is nice, it is situational due to the fact you only get it after disguising and even then it only affects one of your shots before you have to disguise again. To make this weapon more useful overall, I have decided to rework the way this weapon gives a damage bonus. While you still need to be disguised in order to receive the bonus, you now have a 2s period after un-disguising where you deal 20% more damage. This allows for more time to land your shots and deal damage. I have also added a stat that increases this weapons damage against buildings by 20%. Now, on top of dealing more damage more often, you can take down building faster without having to worry about damage penalty against sentries as much. ****** &amp;nbsp; And that is it. I do hope you enjoy my LONG list of changes for a large portion of unlock that are not used all that often. It took me 4 and a half hours to write this entire post. If you have any questions, comments or just want to suggest a change, then please comment below. I look for to responding to all of your comments. Thank you and have a great day."
305,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[IG] The Demoknight Weapons &lt;Demoman All Slots&gt;,2,8kieik,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/8kieik/ig_the_demoknight_weapons_demoman_all_slots/,2018-05-19 12:27:40,"So, you're bored of running ""Stock/Iron Bomber, Stock, Stock"" on Demoman. You want to try his Demoknight weapons seriously, only to realize that they have absolutely no synergy with his normal weapons and are just... kind of bad in any serious setting. These changes aim to improve synergy of the Demoknight weapons with his normal weapons, without changing their main concepts. Let's start. *Note: Increased charging control without boots by +150%, removed boots increasing charge control by +200%. This is because the boots have no synergy with the Tide Turner aside from the extra health, so a change has been made below.* *Another Note: The deploy speed of swords/axes/scimitars/etc has been changed to normal speed. This allows Demoman to cancel charge faster with a melee swing (allowing it to start recharging faster) and helps with his possible, risky burst damage against enemies. This change is modeled after the recent Axtinguisher deploy speed change.* --- **Ali Babi's Wee Booties** ~~**+20% damage resistance while charging**~~ ~~**+25 health on wearer**~~ ~~**Kills fill 25% of your charge meter**~~ ~~**+10% move speed on wearer (shield required)*~~ The 20% damage reduction will help Demos that charge actually survive, considering they travel in a very predictable path. The ""melee kills refill charge meter"" has been changed to ""kills fill charge meter,"" meaning it has increased synergy when fighting with the Stickybomb Launchers (especially the Quickiebomb Launcher, due to the increased damage from charge) at range. I purposely am NOT changing the ""shield required"" attribute due to the reason the stat was added in the first place: a passive that gives Demoman more mobility and utility is just overall better and subjectively more boring than watching a Demoman use a skill-based defensive weapon (Grenade Launcher). --- **Loose Cannon** ~~Cannonballs have a fuse time of 0.8 second; fuses can be primed to explode earlier by holding down the fire key.~~ ~~**+20% projectile speed**~~ ~~**Cannonballs push players back on impact**~~ ~~**Double Donk! Bomb explosions after a cannon ball impact will deal mini-crits to impact victims.**~~ ~~*Cannonballs do not explode on impact*~~ ""I thought this post was about Demoknight weapons?"" Loose Cannon is one of the most used Hybrid-knight weapons when paired with the Tide Turner, so I think it deserves a spot. First of all: fix the projectile speed. According to the wiki's projectile page, Loose Cannon's projectile speed is actually slower than the stock grenade launcher. Make it actually 20% faster. The fuse time has decreased from 0.8s from 1s; I don't think the Loose Cannon should have a much higher effective range than the Grenade Launcher (with the fixed projectile speed), and having to be at a certain range to achieve a Double Donk! is one of the launcher's main weaknesses. This also helps with Loose Cannon jumping, as you can start jumps earlier. --- **The Chargin' Targe** ~~**+30% damage resistance on wearer**~~ ~~**+30% self-damage resistance on wearer**~~ ~~Alt-Fire: Charge towards your enemies and remove debuffs. Gain a critical melee strike after impacting an enemy at distance.~~ The Chargin' Targe has always been the ""resistance"" shield. Paired with the booties, Demoman has as much effective health as a Heavy while charging (although that tankiness won't last long after that charge wears off...). With a grenade launcher, the reduced self-damage allows grenade jumping to take up less health. The universal damage resistance helps against Scouts and Snipers, which can easily hit the Demoman while charging, but makes it worse against Pyros. The same concepts will apply to the other shields as well. An unneeded buff would be to make charge damage 60 (from 50). This would mean you could charge into a scout/sniper, perform a standard melee swing, and kill them. However, this takes skill out of getting the (mini-)crit swing off from charging, so I left it out. --- **The Splendid Screen** ~~**+20% damage resistance on wearer**~~ ~~**+70% increase in charge impact damage**~~ ~~**+50% increase in charge recharge rate**~~ ~~Alt-Fire: Charge toward your enemies and remove debuffs. Gain a critical melee strike after impacting an enemy from distance.~~ The Splendid Screen has its identity as the ""charging"" shield. Without the self-damage resistance on wearer in my suggested Chargin' Targe, grenade jumping is worse, encouraging learning some simple trimp jumps for distance (which is helped by the increased charging control without boots). Aside from that and the universal 20% damage resistance, it functions exactly the same. --- **The Tide Turner** ~~**+15% damage resistance on wearer**~~ ~~**Full turning control while charging.**~~ ~~**Melee kills refill 75% of your charge meter.**~~ ~~*Taking damage while shield charging reduces remaining charge time*~~ ~~Alt-Fire: Charge toward your enemies and remove debuffs. Gain a mini-crit melee strike after impacting an enemy at distance.~~ The only change is the unviersal damage resistance. The damage resistance while charging from the Booties helps to alleviate the second worst downside of the Tide Turner, meaning that the boots actually have some synergy with it aside from health. There is already a lot of skill involved with trimping with the Tide Turner, so I'd rather not take away that skill by limiting the charge control. --- **Eyelander** ~~This weapon has a large melee range and holsters slower~~ ~~**Speed and health are increased with every head you take**~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~*-25 max health on wearer*~~ I think this weapon is perfectly fair. When paired with the Booties, the health downside is ignored, but you have trouble getting into range to use the sword. When paired with a shield, you have damage resistance to make up for the lost health. It is also notable that just one head means you go even on health. The main change is that the ""increased speed and health"" stat has been moved to positive stats, making it more appealing to newer players (who wants to use a weapon with only visible downsides at a glance?). --- **Scotsman's Skullcutter** ~~This weapon has a large melee range and holsters slower~~ ~~When weapon is active:~~ ~~**+20% damage bonus**~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~*-15% move speed on wearer*~~ Because of the universal sword deploy buff, the extra damage from this means it's better at self-defense with its extra damage. Also, no random crits. --- **The Claidheamh Mr** ~~This weapon has a large melee range and holsters slower~~ ~~**0.5 sec increase in charge duration**~~ ~~**Melee kills refill 25% of your charge meter**~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~*-15 health on wearer*~~ Why was this changed in the first place? Who knows! Just please revert the damage vulnerability to its health penalty. Please. --- **The Ullapool Caber** ~~**The first hit will cause an explosion**~~ ~~**Regenerates after 30 seconds**~~ ~~*This weapon holsters 100% slower*~~ ~~*20% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~High-yield Scottish face removal.~~ ~~A sober person would throw it...~~ I don't think the Caber should be used for self-defense, but it shouldn't have high enough damage to one-hit kill a Med on its own. That may be fun, but not on the receiving end. However, like the swords, the deploy speed is removed. The Caber, to me at least, is the ""gimmick"" weapon, somewhat modeled after the Market Gardener. The decreased firing speed and requirements to get the most damage make it situational and a bit harder to use, but not useless. Having it regenerate prevents it from being used in a fight more than once, without crippling you for the rest of your life. --- **Half-Zatoichi** It doesn't need changing. The sword deploy time means it's already better at finishing off enemies and getting that sweet, sweet health. --- **The Persian Persuader** ~~This weapon has a large melee range and holsters slower~~ ~~**Ammo boxes collected refill the Charge meter**~~ ~~**Melee hits fill 20% of your charge meter**~~ ~~*-50% ammo received from ammo boxes*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ So the original Persian Persuader had ammo turned into health and a +100% increase in charge recharge rate... Which is undoubtedly worse than the current design for Hybrid-knights but infinitely better for full-on Demoknights. The current design heavily discourages using it with any sort of weapon other than a Shield and Booties, so that's bad. This proposed design puts an even heavier emphasis on ammo management, with a medium ammo pack only giving one clip of Grenade Launcher ammo instead of two clips, and 6 stickybombs instead of 12. Although this doesn't start with downsides, you'll have a harder time running this over a prolonged period of time. The melee hits fill charge instead of refill, following the same logic as the booties, meaning it has better synergy with the stickybomb launcher. --- That's it. Thoughts?"

Forcing enemies to switch weapons is one of those mechanics you need to be careful with to make sure it's fair, and I think this does it right. The purpose of this weapon is to create This can block ubers but it's fairer to the enemy requiring two hits and they can simply kill you too.

The damage bonus is very situational and really isn't that good, even at max it's not even double damage. The only real use is the uber building you can do with it, though that's situational as well and the escape plan can do it better. (+) Gain an increased damage resistance based on health while active (up to +60%). (-) Blocks healing while active. (-) -50% damage penalty. The change I made ditched the damage bonus for a damage resistance. It makes you harder to kill at lower health so you effectively gain back the health you lost. The thing is that the uber building is gone and you have less damage. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Market Gardener** So the market gardener is a favorite for many people, though I have some gripes with it. My thing is that it's pretty situational in a serious game. The times where you can reliably get it off and get out alive and at the same time do it better than just bombing are slim. It also has pretty much no downside, the swing speed is very negligible. (+) Deals crits while the player is airborne. (+) +50% fall damage resistance while active. (-) -20% swing speed. (-) +40% knockback vulnerability while active. So now you take less damage from falls but you take more knockback. It helps you to survive a launch in and kill someone but also to quickly whip out to avoid taking too much damage. The downside is you can be knocked away easier which gives you a way to be countered easier. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Half-Zatoichi** The half zatoichi is probably soldier's worst melee. It's hard to get any kills with your melee and the punishment of being restricted to melee unless you take 50 health. It *can* build uber but it's a bit a bit wonky and other weapons do it better. (+) This weapon has a large melee range and deploys and holsters slower. (+) Gain 66% of base health and a 3 second speed boost on kill. (+) Deals minicrits when below 50% health. (-) Honorbound: Once drawn sheathing deals 50 self damage So now there is more bang for your buck because you gain both 16% more health and a quick speed boost on kill. These make your efforts to actually get the kill. Also you deal minicrit damage when below half health which makes getting that health when you need it easier. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Escape Plan** Contrary to the zatoichi, this is easily soldier's best melee weapon. You gain an escape plan by speeding away when at low health. It is useful a lot of the time and can be a real life saver. Also you can build uber with the downside of less healing and the marked for death isn't too big since you are already at low health. (+) Gain a speed boost while active as the user becomes injured (up to +45%). (-) You are marked for death while active and for a short period after switching weapons. (-) Blocks healing while active. So now the weapon still has it's pretty useful upsides, but it isn't as powerful. The max speed boost was decreased from 60% to 45% which makes it not as effective. Also it was changed to blocking healing so you can't build uber with it. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Disciplinary Action** So the disciplinary action might be a bit more situational compared to the escape plan, but it is just as useful. The downside of less damage is barely noticeable and if you've ever played medieval you'd know it's actually better for combat. It also is seen as broken in comp due to being able to whip heavy to mid. (+) On Ally Hit: Boosts ally's and user's speed for several seconds. (-) -25% damage penalty. (-) +35% self damage vulnerability. So now it has a bit more of a meaningful downside. Since you have a better rollout game which also helps your teammates, the downside makes rocket jumps more damaging. It switches how you roll out but also helps your teammates out. "
308,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,"[IG/UP] ""Rework/Redesign of Underutilized weapons"" &lt;All Clas ALl Slots&gt;",6,8m8fc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/8m8fc8/igup_reworkredesign_of_underutilized_weapons_all/,2018-05-26 16:54:44,"Welcome to part two of my rework/redesign post for TF2 most underutilized/underpowered weapons. This post will be similar in format to the previous post, so expect a long list of changes. For those who haven't read part one, these post will take a look at weapons for each class that are considered too situational, underpowered or underutilized and attempt to add new stats or rework old stats in order to make the weapon more useful for both pro's and casual players alike in any format. All of the changes listed in this post were designed with three simple goals in mind: to make the weapon useful for general play, to make the weapon balance for competitive and pubs and, most importantly, to be fun to use. If you find yourself disagreeing with any of the changes I present or just wish to give some advice, then please comment below. Now let us begin: **Scout** &amp;nbsp; **The Baby Faces Blaster** *Reason for change: In this rework I have removed the stats ""Boost reduced on air jumps"" and ""10% slower movement speed on wearer"". I have also lowered both the amount of boost you can minimal gain from dealing damage and, more importantly, reduced the amount of boost you lose when dealt damage from 4% boost to just 1.1%. However, to balance this weapon I have increase the maximum amount of damage you need to deal in order to gain a full boost meter and also reduced how fast you can go with this weapon from 173% to 163%. I have also added a new mechanic related to the boost meter: as you gain more boost and gain a movement speed bonus, your air jump height will decrease resulting in you losing air mobility. That is the trade off for using this weapon* &amp;nbsp; (=) Alter how boost mechanic works: As you gain boost your movement speed increase up to a max of +30% movement speed. Air jump height decreases with boost (up to -50% reduction in air jump height). (+) Remove the stat Boost reduced on air jumps (+) Remove the stat 10% slower movement speed on wearer (-) Decrease minimum boost gained from any damage dealt from 5% to 1% (-) Increase max damage requirement to gain a full boost meter from 100 damage to 250. (+) Reduce boost lost when damage from 4% to 1.1%. (This means it take 225 damage to take away all of your boost). ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Flying Guillotine** *Reason for change: These change just make the act of killing a enemy player or managing to hit someone at long range with this weapon more rewarding* &amp;nbsp; (-)Remove the stat of gaining a 1.5 recharge bonus towards recharging weapon. (+)Add the following stat: Killing with or getting a Long distance hit with this weapon completely recharges weapon. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **The Sandman** *Reason for change: In its current iteration, the sandman is worthless. It was a good thing to nerf it, but replacing the stun mechanic with a mechanic that only reduces a persons movement speed wasn't a great call. For this reason, I have decided to make the sandman more useful and (hopefully) without making it annoying to fight against again. Now, based on how far the ball traveled, enemies hit with the ball will suffer a firing rate penalty (from 5% to 35%) that can last from 1s to up to 5s. To balance the weapon and prevent scouts from spamming, this weapon now has a new downside: the ball now recharges 100% slower (from 15s to 30s). I have also reversed the changes made to the ball recharge time.* &amp;nbsp; (-) Launched balls no longer slows opponents (+) Launched balls now reduces an opponents firing speed depending on distance. (Minimum of 5% to a maximum of 35%). (=) Hidden: duration of firing speed penalty depends on distance (From 1s to 5s). (-) Add a new stat: Ball Recharges 100% slower while weapon is inactive (-) Increase recharge time from 10s to 15s ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **SOLDIER** &amp;nbsp; **The Liberty Launcher** *Reason for change: This weapon's only downside makes this weapon underpowered when compared to the stock rocket launcher. However, the main problem with this weapon is that it doesn't have a role that all its own. In this rework I have decided to give the Liberty Launcher a role all its own: a rocket launcher designed for roamers who desire a secondary weapon both than the gunboats. To aid in its new found role, I have gotten rid of the faster projectile speed and extra clip size stats on the weapon, reduced the damage penalty by 10% and added the new stat of ""This weapon holsters 40% faster"". So if you primary play roamer, you can now enjoy suffering less damage from rocket jumps and be able to still have a secondary that can deal damage.* &amp;nbsp; (-)Remove the stat +40% projectile speed (-) Remove the stat +25% clip size (+) Reduce damage penalty from -25% to -15% (+) Add the stat This weapon holsters 40% faster. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Righteous Bison** *Reason for rework: In this rework, I only increased the length of the weapons projectile hitbox in order to allow it to deal more damage while the beam is traveling through a group of players. I have also added a new downside in order to prevent the situation that originally lead to the weapon being nerf in the first place.* &amp;nbsp; (+) Increase the length of the particles hitbox (-) Add the stat Minicrits whenever it would normally crit ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **The Pain Train** *Reason for rework: Now it would be a mistake to say that this weapon is never used. It is actually used quite a bit in competitive but in pubs it is barely used. To make this weapon more appealing to casual players, I have added a often recommended suggestion where this weapon will now also increase your movement speed while carrying the intelligence briefcase or PASS Time JACK. However, an issue with this weapon is that the bullet damage vulnerability this weapon has barely effects a players ability most of the time. In order to make the penalty more noticeable without making it so that scouts can one-shot a demoman, I have replaced the bullet damage vulnerability penalty with a reduction in max health.* &amp;nbsp; (+) Add the stat +15% movement speed while carrying intelligence briefcase or PASS Time JACK (+) Removes the stat 10% bullet damage vulnerability on wearer (-) Add the stat -15 max health ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **PYRO** &amp;nbsp; **The Backburner** *Reason for rework: the weapon is barely used by most pyros, but when it is used by a skill pyro it can absolutely destroy a team on defense. It is basically a more situational version of the phlogistinator on defense. This rework attempts to make the weapon less situational while also making it fair to play against. I have also added stats to encourage players to attack from behind and, when in combat, use the speed to either run away or out maneuver their opponent.* &amp;nbsp; (+) Increase the degree radius that is considered the back of an enemy from 90 degrees to 110. (-) Change the stat 100% critical hits from behind to 100% minicrits from behind (+) Add new stat On hit: gain a speed boost (+) Reduce airblast cost penalty from +150% to 100%. (From 4 airblasts to 5) (-) Add the stat -25% damage penalty vs players from the front ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **The Detonator** *Reason for rework: This weapon was used often by skilled pyros, but the thermal thruster has kinda eclipsed it as pyro's main source of mobility. In order to allow this weapon to compete with the thermal thruster, I have decreased the amount of damage you receive from this weapon while flare jumping. I have also added a stat that allows you to gain more height with this weapon than ever before. However, I have also added a new penalty to afterburn damage in order to balance the fact that you have more mobility options in the long run that if you use the thermal thruster.* &amp;nbsp; (+) Reduce the self-damage value of the weapon from 50% to 35%. (+) Add the stat +75% increase knockback to self (-) Add new stat -33% afterburn damage penalty (=) Flares from the Detonator detonate within 100Hu when they hit a surface. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ *Neon Annihilator** Reason of rework: While it does have a unique gimmick that makes it fun to use in maps with large bodies of water, this weapon is just a weaker version of the homewrecker. Instead of making this weapon more useful on defense (like the homewrecker), I have decided to make this weapon useful for attack sentry nests of offense. You can now disable enemy buildings for 1.5s just by hitting them. You also gain a reduction in knockback from damage, but you are still vulnerable to airblast knockback so be wary when facing other pyros. &amp;nbsp; (-) Remove the stat Damage removes sappers (+) Add the stat Disables enemy buildings for 1.5s on hit (+) Add the stat -40% reduction in push force taken from damage. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **DEMOMAN** &amp;nbsp; **The Persian Persuader** &amp;nbsp; *Reason for rework: this weapon downsides heavily incentivizes a pure demo-knight playstyle, but most demo-knights already use weapons like the Eyelander, Claidheamh Mor, or Scotsmans Skullcutter. These changes make using this weapon alongside demos explosive dealing weapons more viable, while also making the weapon more useful and interesting while demo-knighting* (=) Alter how ammo boxes give charge: Now the amount of charge you gain depends on the type of ammo box. (Small box = 15% charge. Medium box = 25%. Large box = 50 %.) (+) Remove the stats -80% max primary ammo on wearer and -80% max secondary ammo on wearer (-) Add the new stat Receive -40% ammo for all sources ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **HEAVY** &amp;nbsp; **The Brass Beast** *Reason for rework: Do I even need to state why this weapon isnt that great? In order to make this weapon more useful for defending and attacking, I have replaced the damage bonus with a firing rate bonus and added a improved version of the damage resistance stat. I have also removed the slower movement speed penalty and the penalty to spin-up time. To balance these changes, I have added a new downside where your max overheal is reduced by 50% (From 450 to 375) while you have this weapon equipped. I have also added a accuracy penalty in order to prevent this weapon from being too good on offense while still being reliable on defense.* &amp;nbsp; All stats have been removed and replaced with the following: (+) Add the stat +20% faster firing rate (+) Add the stat +25% damage and critical resistance when above 50% health and spun up (-) Add the stat Max overheal reduced by 50% (-) Add the stat 25% less accurate ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **The Natascha** Reason for change: Often labeled heavy's supportive minigun, in practice it is only used for combating scouts. In order to make this weapon actually a supportive minigun, I have removed the slow mechanic all together along with the stat that gives you a 20% damage resistance when below 50% health. In the slow mechanics place i have added a new mechanic: Adrenaline. When you deal damage, you fill up a bar. When the bar is full, press the RELOAD Key in order to give yourself and nearby teammates a speed boost WHILE YOU ARE SPUN UP. The speed buff is to encourage teammates to go on the offensive when needed but will also allow you to avoid more damage through you new found mobility. I have also reduced the damage penalty from 25% to 20% (Still noticeable, but at least you are more likely to kill players). &amp;nbsp; (-) Remove the following stats: On Hit: 100% chance to slow target and -20% damage resistance when below 50% health and spun up. (+) Add the stat: On hit: build Adrenaline. (+) Reduce damage penalty from -25% to 20%. (=) While bar is full, press the RELOAD key to increase movement speed of teammates and yourself while spun up. (You gain a 35% increase in movement speed. Teammates gain a straight +10% movement speed. Doesnt stack with other movement speed buffs. Teammates must be within 300 units of the heavy to gain the boost.) (=) Hidden: only 35% of damage dealt by primary weapon will be counted towards building Adrenaline bar. (=) Needs to deal 600 damage to fill up the bar ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **The Buffalo Steak Sandvich** *Reason for change: Often labeled as heavy's worst secondary option, this weapon yet still has a large following of players who use this weapon for boxing heavy. To make this weapon useful for general use but also fun to use while using melee, the effect of this weapon now gives a general 25% faster firing rate to ALL weapon for 8 seconds. While under the effect you also suffer a 40% reduction in healing from all sources. I have also made it so that, on consumption, this weapon heals you for 150 health. This weapon is designed for solo heavies who wish to deal as much damage as possible at the cost of being a glass cannon even with a medic and being less effective at healing teammates with your lunchbox item. &amp;nbsp; All stats have been removed and replaced with the following: (=) After consuming, gain a 25% increase in firing rate on all weapons and suffer a 40% reduction in healing. Effect lasts for 8s. (+) Eat to gain up to 150 health. (=) Alt-Fire: share with a friend (Small Health kit) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **ENGINEER** &amp;nbsp; **The Wrangler** *Reason for change: This weapon is controversial. While it is good that engineer has a weapon that allows him to deal with long range enemies and be able to handle single targets easier, the resistances this weapon gives makes this weapon too strong against team pushes which leads to stalemates. To reduce the amount of stalemates this weapon cause while also making sure it is useless against any powerclass, I have reworked how the shield resistance works. When you have the Wrangler equipped a bar will appear. This bar is the shields health pool and is reduced by any damage that is absorbed by the shield itself. The amount of resistances the shield gives is directly linked to this health pool and, as the shields health pool lowers, less and less damage is absorbed by the shield and is instead directly applied to the sentry gun itself. This change makes it so that focus fire one a sentry gun will lower it ability to resist damage quickly, making it easier to take down a sentry. However, to give engineers some means to fight against a push, as the bar depletes the penalty towards repairing is also lessened but only to 20% while the shield is active.* &amp;nbsp; Rework how the shield works: (=) The amount of resistance the shield gives is based on a new charge bar. The bar contains 660 points of charge. (-) All damage that is reduced by the shield instead deals damage to the charge bar. The amount of damage dealt depends on the current amount of damage resistance the shield has. (Example: dealing 100 damage deals 66 damage to the shield and 34 damage to the sentry when it is at full charge, while the second shot will deal 62.6 damage to the shield and 37.4 damage to the sentry due to the shield being at 94.8% charge. This is to make the weapon still useful against solo players but now weaker against team pushes.) (-) The charge bar can only recharge while the weapon has been holstered for 3.5 seconds. Recharges at a rate of 66 points per second (takes 10 seconds to completely recharge the shield when bar has been depleted. (+) As bar depletes, the penalty towards repairing is lessen until it is only reduced by 20% while shield is up. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Southern Hospitality** *Reason for change: the Southern Hospitality isnt necessary a weak option for engineer melee slot, but it just isnt interesting and doesnt really have a role that is all its own. This rework makes the Southern Hospitality more of a defensive tool for engineers but at the cost of buildings costing more metal. This means you can keep up building more easily, but cant rebuild as easily as before.* &amp;nbsp; (+) Add the stat 25% faster repair rate (+) Remove the stat 20% fire damage vulnerability on wearer (-) Add the stat  20% increase in building cost ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **MEDIC** &amp;nbsp; **The Overdose** *Reason for change: the Overdose is overshadowed by the Crusaders Crossbow and the speed bonus it gives isnt all that useful for escaping. This change makes the weapon much more useful for escaping enemies but at the cost of 20% of your uber. I have also increase the damage penalty of the weapon to make the downside actually noticeable when in use. To prevent abuse with the speed and damage resistance, I have made it so that medic who have this weapon equipped receive 30% less healing from dispensers and other medics.* &amp;nbsp; Rework speed bonus based on uber stat: (+) While Active, ALT-Fire to use 20% of you uber to gain a speed boost and damage resistance for 4s. (Speed boost is equivalent to the Disciplinary Action speed boost and the damage resistance is 20%). (-) Increase damage penalty from 15% to 30% (-) Add the stat ""-30% health from healers on wearer"" ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Vaccinator** &amp;nbsp; *Reason for change: a controversial change for a controversial weapon. The vaccinator in the right hands can absolutely dominate a match which is why the weapon is banned in competitive. Even in pubs this weapon is frustrating to fight against. This change make the weapon fairer for teams with lower player counts while still retaining some of the versatility that the current weapon offers medics with it damage resistances and ability to deploy multiple ubercharges. I have also made it so that you now resist melee weapons, so enjoy the fact that now melees deal only 55 damage per hit.* &amp;nbsp; All stats have been removed and replaced with the following: (+) Add the stat +15% ubercharge rate (+) While healing, provides you and your targets with a constant 15% resistance to all damage types. (-) Add the stat 50% Overheal build rate (+) Hidden: ubercharge bar is divided into two separate bars. Can uber when one of these bars is full and uber will last for 4s. (+) Ubercharge provides a 4 second resistance bubble that blocks 75% base damage of all resistances and 100% crit damage. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **SNIPER** **Tribalmans shiv** *Reason for change: Compared to snipers other melee option, the Tribalman's shiv is just underwhelming. Sure, it is ok at spy checking but the massive damage penalty will make sure you won't be able to kill the spy if you enter a melee fight with him (unless you get a luck crit). Also items like the deadringer exist, so the bleed mechanic this weapon give just isn't worth the harsh damage penalty. To make this weapon actually useful, I have reduced the damage penalty from -50% to -25%. I have also added a new stat that allows snipers to heal from the bleed they inflicted. To prevent snipers from just avoiding the damage penalty with random crits, I have made it so that this weapon can longer deal random critical hits.* &amp;nbsp; (+) Reduce damage penalty from -50% to -25%. (+) Add the stat Healed for half of bleed damage you inflict (-) Add the stat No random critical hits ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **SPY** &amp;nbsp; **Diamondback** &amp;nbsp; *Reason for rework: I have always had the mindset that spy should not be given a weapon that can deal crits without the need to have good aim. This weapon it just a straight upgrade to the stock. In this rework I have taken cues from my original rework of the weapon while making some noticeable changes. When you backstab or kill someone with this weapon, you will gain a token that will increase your sapper damage and reduce the amount of damage sentry guns deal towards you by 10% for each token. This bonus maxes out at 4 token or 40%. This weapon also minicrits when you hit someone from behind. However to balance this weapon I have removed the worthless damage penalty with a more severe clip size penalty.* &amp;nbsp; (-) Remove the stat Gives one guaranteed critical hit for each building destroyed with your sapper attached or backstab kill (+) Add the stat For each backstab or kill gain with this weapon, gain a 10% increase in sapper damage and sentry damage resistance (Max 40%) (+)Remove the stat -15% damage penalty (+) Add the stat Minicrits from behind enemy players (-) Add the stat -35% clip size ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Red tape recorder** *Reason for change: the red tape recorder is only really useful for mass sentry nest and mini-sentries. In all regards this weapon is very situational and is quiet weak when compared to the stock sapper. In order to make this weapon more useful I have added a new stat called Sabotage. This new stat makes it so that, when this sapper is removed and depending on how much the building was downgrades, the next wrench hit consumes more metal for all operations (Healing, refilling ammo, and/or upgrading). This change makes this sapper better at slowing down engineers when it comes to rebuilding their nest.* &amp;nbsp; (+) Add the stat Sabotage: After sapper removal (Depending on how many levels were downgraded*) and building is active again, next melee swing that repairs, refills ammo, or upgrades building will cost the user more metal. *(0 Levels of downgrade = 33% higher metal cost. 1 Level of downgrade = 66%. 2 or more levels of downgrade = 100 %.) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Dead ringer** *Reason for change: Despite what most of us have experienced, this watch, due to the nerfs it had experienced during jungle inferno, it likely the lest equipped watch in spy's arsenal. However, that doesn't stop this weapon from being frustrating to fight against due to the speed boost and damage resistance. While other would just remove the speed boost entirely, the fact remains is that without a speed boost the TF2 team would have to increase the damage resistances this weapon gives in order to prevent it from becoming outright useless. To both balance and make the weapon less frustrating to fight against, I have copied my design for the wrangler and applied it to the dead ringer. Now, when you trigger your dead ringer, you will still receive a speed boost (though with a now shorter duration) and a high initial damage resistance, however now taking damage while cloak will reduce you cloak meter. You damage resistance is currently tied to your cloak meter, so taking damage while cloak will reduce you damage resistances faster. However, it will also lower the amount of cloak you have to work with. This change encourages spies to actually avoid getting hit and rewards players for managing to track down spies. I have also gotten rid of some now useless stats and added a new stat that allows you to recharge your dead ringer with ammo again, but at a much slower rate than before. &amp;nbsp; (+)Change description of the weapon so that it states this weapon also give temporary afterburn immunity after being triggered. (=) Damage dealt towards you while cloak will now also reduce the amount of cloak time you have remaining. (Only 20% of any damage you suffer will directly take away cloak. Example a rocket will only take away 18% of your cloak. The stock flamethrower will also take away 18.62% to 34.66% of your cloak per second). (-) Reduce speed boost duration from 3s to 2.5s. (=) Remove the stats +40% cloak duration and -50% cloak meter when Feign Death is activated (-) Add the stat 70% less cloak charge from ammo packs ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &amp;nbsp; And that's it. I do hope you enjoyed part two of my list of reworks/redesigns of underutilized weapons. If you have any questions, comments or just want to suggest a change, then please comment below. I look for to responding to all of your comments. Thank you and have a great day. "

It's probably one of the worst Soldier weapons because of how useless it is. That's why I want to make it an alternative to the Gunboats, still holding it's original design with extra bonuses. The ''200% increased air control when blast jumping.'' stat needs to be removed. It's quite unnecessary. This would be it's new stats: **The Mantreads** ~~**-75% reduction in push force taken from damage**~~ ~~**-75% reduction in airblast vulnerability**~~ ~~**Deals 5x damage based on how much fall damage you would normally take**~~ ~~**No fall damage**~~ ~~**+20% health from packs on wearer**~~ Landing on an enemy can be pretty hard and when you're bombing it's still better to use your Rocket Launcher anyway, so that's why the damage has to be increased. No fall damage might save you some damage from rocket jumps you would normally take fall damage from. More health from health packs also helps with recovering from rocket jumps, so it is useful for roaming Soldiers. "
310,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,"[IG] ""The Bushwacka"" &lt;Sniper Melee&gt;",0,8oz2vl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/8oz2vl/ig_the_bushwacka_sniper_melee/,2018-06-06 18:54:45,"\*\*The Bushwacka\*\* \~\~\*\*25&amp;#37; damage boost\*\*\~\~ \~\~\*\*On kill: gain 40 health\*\*\~\~ \~\~\*\*20&amp;#37; damage vulnerability while active\*\*\~\~ \~\~\*\*No random crits\*\*\~\~ This weapon may not necessarily be OP or UP, but I dislike it greatly and have suggested a possible rework for it. Currently it's almost a straight upgrade when you have jarate and almost a straight downgrade when you don't, and it allows sniper to 1\-shot almost anything in melee. I think that this weapon is the only reason jarate is banned in medieval. My rework aims to make this weapon into a finisher for more aggressive, frontline\-focused snipers, that, much like the current version, is risky to use but with a decent payoff. I hope you liked it. (but I'm expecting lots of downvotes for this)"

Well that was a long break, wasn't it? . A utility weapon for the pyro making him stronger against hitscan classes at the expense of being weaker against solllies and demos, and in addition weakening her ability to fight other pyros. This body armour takes the melee slot, meaning you cant use your melee weapons, but still can use your flamie and flarie. Also, because it's kinda significant, pyro wearing it would look like having a heated up metal furnace on his stomach. . Let me know what you think. "
312,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,"[UP] ""Syringe Guns"" &lt;Medic, Primary&gt;",1,8qmbg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/8qmbg9/up_syringe_guns_medic_primary/,2018-06-13 06:25:35,"**Syringe Gun** *Level 2 Syringe Gun* ~~**Syringes can heal teammates for +3 HP per hit, scaling based on your current ubercharge to a maximum of +6 HP per hit**~~ ~~*Healing via syringes does not build bercharge*~~ ~~Syringe healing scales in this way:~~ ~~&lt;25% bercharge = +3 HP per hit~~ ~~25% - 50% bercharge = +4 HP per hit~~ ~~50% - 75% bercharge = +5 HP per hit~~ ~~&gt;75% bercharge = +6 HP per hit~~ With these new stats, the Crossbow retains its role as a long-distance healing tool, while the Syringe Gun (in addition to it's classic panicking role) can be used for fast, short-range healing. It doesn't render the Medi Gun useless, however, as you can't build ber via syringes. Note that these changes apply to ALL syringe weapons unless specified otherwise, in the same way that the healing-from-extinguishing stat applies to all Flamethrowers. Speaking of which, let me go ahead and rework the other two syringe weapons, and unless specified otherwise, assume the above stats apply to them: **Blutsauger** *Level 4 Syringe Gun* ~~**On Hit: Enemies are coated with Mad Milk for 2 seconds**~~ ~~*Syringe healing with this weapon provides 2 less HP per thit (min +1 HP per hit, max +4 HP per hit)*~~ These changes would make the Blutsauger a much better option than just the ""run away/combat medic"" role it has now. Since it applies Mad Milk, it can instead be used for a support role. The new tradeoff isn't vulnerability for the Medic (i.e. reduced healing over time), but rather you're giving up the new syringe healing bonus (or at least giving up the option to do so effectively). Combat Medics, too, can get more bang for their buck, as the Mad Milk will grant +3 HP to +7 HP per hit, rather than the old Blutsauger's flat +3 HP per hit bonus. **Overdose** ~~Level 1 Syringe Gun~~ ~~**Alt-Fire: Receive a speed boost for 5 seconds, and max health bonus (equal to half your current bercharge) for 15 seconds**~~ ~~*15 seconds after using Alt-Fire: Your max health is set to 100 HP, regenerating 5 max health per second*~~ ~~If your health is above 100 HP after those 15 seconds, it is set to 100 HP; if below, it remains at its current amount.~~ Playing into the name of this weapon, now instead of an active bonus, you can choose to activate brief ""overdose"" to your benefit. Rather than having a penalty to damage, however, the tradeoff comes in that your overdose will eventually weaken you for a short while."
313,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[IG] Weapons banned on the 6s global whitelist,4,8qnjd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/8qnjd7/ig_weapons_banned_on_the_6s_global_whitelist/,2018-06-13 09:04:56,"So I've done this kind of thing before, though I've wanted do redo it for a while. There's been changes to a few weapons and I think some ideas i had were eh. Also there are a few weapons that have been recently changed or are merely bugged that I will avoid covering. So by that out of all of the 26 weapons banned currently I will only be covering 20 of them. So without further ado.... **B.A.S.E. Jumper** So the banning of the base jumper is a controversial one, but there is a reason. You can fly up high and spam while easily avoiding attacks. It's not horribly overpowered, but it can be a bit annoying which is why it's banned. (+) Press 'JUMP' key in the air to deploy. Deployed parachutes slow your descent. (-) Marked for death for 5 seconds after landing. So instead of nerfing it's effectiveness in air, I decided to debuff you once you land. It means you have to be careful when you land and it means you are less effective after use. **Reserve Shooter** The reserve shooter has very minimal upsides which aren't the most effective thing, but it has practically no downside. The 2 less clip is barely noticeable and means it's pretty much a direct upgrade. Also the mini-crits on jumping targets is very gimmicky due to the difference in ease of combos, which makes it near impossible to balance on both classes. (+) +25% damage bonus. (+) +20% deploy and holster speed. (-) -50% clip size. (-) -33% reload speed. So I ditched the gimmicky combo system in favor of just a straight damage buff. I also reduced the clip size by 1 and added a reload speed penalty which means it has some actual downsides as well. **Soda Popper** The scout is a very annoying class, and being able to give scout some pretty easy access to 5 extra jumps which if used right can easily dodge a lot of damage can be a bit annoying and on top of that the weapon actually a higher dps than stock. (+) +33% reload speed. (+) +50% firing speed. (+) Second successful hit on an enemy is a mini-crit. (-) -66% clip size. So as much as I like the hype meter, it's never been too balanced. Instead of some new gimmick, I decided to go back to it's roots and give it some mini-crits. I increased the reload speed but also made the second successful hit deal a minicrit. This makes it the more burst damage weapon but it cuts out the utility. **Bonk! Atomic Punch** The bonk is a weapon that is a bit undervalued, but it's still banned. It gives scout a way to quickly get out of a bad situation with basically a not die potion. You can also just tank a bunch of damage which involves getting in the way of people and blocking sentry fire. (+) Deal damage to fill a ""Bonk"" meter (300 damage). (+) Once full, drink to gain a +25% damage resistance and -10% speed for 10 seconds. So now it doesn't make the most annoying class completely invincible but it also means you can be tanky but still can attack. Also instead of charging by time and instead by damage which means it requires more skill to use as well. **Crit-A-Cola** The critty boy gives the amazing scunt the ability to one shot other scouts and bring medics down to very low health while you can still pretty easily avoid attacks or just go for suicide plays. (+) Deal damage to fill a ""Crit"" meter (300 damage). (+) Once full, drink to gain +25% firing and reload speed and a +10% damage vulnerability. So now like the bonk it requires more skill to fill up the drink. Also now instead of mini-crits it gives faster firing and reload speed which raises dps without making you one shot enemies. **Flying Guillotine** The guillotine may not seem too threatening but you can do 50 cabbage + 40 bleed damage at any range which means you get a free 90 damage spam weapon. It's basically a burst damage version of your pistol. (+) Throw at your enemies to make them bleed! Damage and bleed time are reduced with distance. (+) Deals minicrit damage on debuffed enemies. (-) 15 second recharge. The fall-off idea is one I'm not sure the exact numbers for, though I think 50% (25 damage and 2.5 seconds of bleed) would be good. Giving scout such high range isn't that good of an idea, he's supposed to be limited to close range. I also increased the charge rate which means it isn't as spammable. And finally I added that it deals mini-crits on debuffed targets which means it's good for combos again but not as powerful. Mini-crits also have no falloff so it can be used at range then. **Mad Milk** The mad milk is probably the most overpowered weapon that scout has. You can splash it into a group of people which means they will pretty much be losing any fight. Also splash it on a someone and you will likely beat them in 1 on 1. All this on top of the fact that the splash is humongous and you'll likely hit at least someone. (+) Deal damage to fill a ""Milk"" meter (300 damage). (+) Milked enemies will heal 45% of damage taken to the attacker. (+) Extinguishing teammates reduces cooldown by 20%. (-) Milk duration falls off with distance from initial splash. So like the bonk and cola you now need to deal damage to fill the meter rather than it building with time. Also I lowered the healing from damage to only 45%. And finally the duration of milk falls off with splash so it's not as easily spammable. This change makes it less of a threat for groups but still good for 1v1s. **Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol** The pocket pistol is banned for a simple reason, it's a direct upgrade. The clip lost is minimal and you can just spam it from long range to get chip health back. (+) Heal 50 health on kill. (+) +15% firing speed. (-) -60% clip size. So now the clip reduction is a lot higher and actually quite punishing. Also the health on hit was replaced with health on kill which means you can't spam it to gain back chip health. Though now you can get back quite a lot of health if you finish people off. **Cow Mangler 5000** The cow mangler is another one of those direct upgrade dealies. In 6s there are rarely sentries and the lack of critical hits is pretty situational. It's not like the kritzkreig medic can't uber anyone else. (+) Alt-Fire: Fires a charge shot that mini-crits players, sets them on fire, and disables buildings for 4 seconds. (+) Does not require ammo. (-) -80% damage against buildings. (-) -20% reload speed. So instead of the mini-crits when it normally crits thing it's a 20% slower reload. It's a downside that is actually punishing and makes it not a direct upgrade. **Disciplinary Action** The disciplinary action is a weapon that provides a pretty big buff to your team and has pretty much no downside. The speed boost can get everyone to mid faster and the less damage is a joke, especially with the increased range. (+) On Ally Hit: Boosts ally's and user's speed for several seconds. (-) -25% damage penalty. (-) +35% self damage vulnerability. So now you can give your team better rollouts and you have a better ground rollout but your jumps are going to cost a lot more health. **Natascha** This is banned for an obvious reason, the slowdown is a bit much. It makes people run on quicksand which is a bit annoying. (+) On Hit: Slows down enemy (40% at max, 8% at closest). (+) +50% max ammo. (-) -25% damage penalty. (-) -15% spin up speed. So now the slowdown is a lot less powerful but still noticable to be useful. Also I replaced the damage resistance with the old extra ammo penalty. To top it off, the spin up speed penalty was reduced quite a bit so it doesn't take as long to get out damage. **Buffalo Steak Sandvich** The steak is banned for one simple reason, it can get a heavy to mid. It gives you a free speed boost which will likely wear off before getting to mid and you can still heal your medic as effectively. (+) On Consumption: Gain +25% movespeed, mini-crits, and -25% health from healers while your melee is active for 20 seconds. (-) Steak only counts as a small health kit. So now the whole gimmick of the sandvich is a lot more viable since you have all the benefits but you can still use your primary and you don't take extra damage. The downside is that the speed is lowered a bit and the steak is only a small health kit. **Rescue Ranger** The rescue ranger is banned due to it giving the engineer the ability to tank loads of damage without getting in harm's way. You can just sit in spawn and defend last much more effectively. (+) Alt-Fire: Use 100 metal to pick up your targeted building from long range. (+) Fires a special bolt that can repair and refill friendly buildings with healing based on distance. (-) -34% clip size. (-) -50% max primary ammo. (-) Self mark for death while hauling buildings. (-) 4 to 1 health to metal ratio when healing buildings. So the changes made were slightly minor but it does help to limit its abilities. The healing now has fall-off which means that when you are far away sitting in a safe place you aren't going to be as effective. I'd say have the minimum healing be 35. For a slight compensation it now can refill the ammo for buildings so you don't run out of ammo from a range. **Wrangler** The wrangler is a very powerful weapon which is amplified in a smaller team size like in 6s. You can increase the health of the sentry immensely which makes it incredibly hard to take down. (+) Takes manual control of your sentry and increases firing rate 2x. (+) Take 40% less damage from your own sentry while wrangled. So that's it, I just removed everything except for the manual control of your sentry. I also added in that you take less damage from jumps so you can be a lot more mobile. It means you don't have a shield but you also don't repair slower and have a delay after holstering. Manual control of your sentry and increased firing rate is a fair trade for no pistol. **Quick Fix** The quick fix is a weapon many people see as underpowered, but in a format like 6s it can be pretty good. It requires the enemy team to deal out 40% more damage to take you out which means a quick fix pocket will likely do better than a normal pocket. It also builds uber much quicker and in a smaller team size the uber is basically invincibility. (+) Crit heals build 60% faster. (+) +25% uber build rate. (+) Mirrors speed and blast jumps of patients (-) -50% max overheal. (=) Ubercharge grants +200% heal rate and immunity to movement imparing effects. So now instead of a flat faster heal rate it is instead faster crit heal buildup. It makes it still effective to heal your teammates but it doesn't heal faster in combat. Also the uber build rate was increased but the effect of the uber was nerfed to be easier to counter. **Vaccinator** The vaccinator is a very interesting idea though it does tend to be a bit annoying. Being able to shut down an entire damage type and do it so quickly is not that fun to fight. It just needs it's stats toned down a bit though maybe a few buffs in there too. (=) Press your reload key to cycle through resist types. (+) Healed for 10% of resisted damage. (+) +50% uber build rate. (+) While healing, provides you and your target with a constant 10% damage resistance to the selected damage type. (-) -25% uber build rate on overhealed patients. (-) -33% overheal build rate (=) Ubercharge provides a 2.5 second resistance bubble that blocks 66% base damage and 100% crit damage to the selected damage type. Basically all I did was tweak the stats to make the upsides not as huge but the downsides not as big either. It's all just toned down so it's not as annoying but not as punishing either. Also I readded the old healed for damage resisted stat which was a pretty good stat that I think should be added back. **Solemn Vow** The solemn vow is another of the many straight upgrades in here. The 10% firing speed is nothing compared to the massive upside it has. It allows you to see enemy uber which removes a big skill needed in competitive, uber tracking. It makes it very easy and just is very cheap. (+) Allows the user to passively see enemy health. (-) Enemies can see the users health. So now it's a weapon which gives you an upside but gives your enemy the same upside. It's effectiveness is based on both how you and your enemy can use this skill. Also I removed the uber tracking since that's a very cheap ability. **Machina** The machina is another straight upgrade. The extra damage and piercing are situational but the downsides are so negligable it doesn't really matter. (+) On Full Charge: +15% damage bonus. (+) On Full Charge: Shots pierce players. (-) Cannot fire unless zoomed. (-) Fires tracer rounds. (-) -15% charge rate. So that's it, just a slightly slower charge rate. It's not big enough to make it criminally underpowered but enough so it likely won't be banned. Since the upsides are only on a full charge, having to charge slightly longer makes it a bit more balanced. Basically it's just not a near direct upgrade anymore. **Sydney Sleeper** The sleeper has always been seen as underpowered, but it's still banned in competitive. The ability to apply jarate from any range for even less aim than stock is likely never going to be unbanned. (+) On Kill: Create a jarate explosion. (+) +20% charge rate per jarated enemy. (+) Shots extinguish teammates. (-) -25% damage penalty. So now instead of jarate applied on hit it is a jarate explosion on kill. This makes it good for coating a group of people from a range which makes it easier for your teammates to finish them all off. Also charge rate increases per jarated enemy which means consecutive kills are easier. Instead of no headshots there is a damage penalty which means quickscopes won't one shot but it's better at killing than it is now. **Jarate** Alright last weapon, so I'll make it quick and simple. The jarate applies a massive debuff to a group of people which is very powerful. (=) Jarate now requires 300 damage to fill instead of 22 seconds. (-) Jarate effect timer falls off with distance. So now it takes more skill to fill up and use and it isn't as spammable. And we're done. "

This weapon has a lot of potential,it just needs to be made more accessible without becoming over powered.

Here is why I think these proposed stats will balance out pretty well. With the old stats, the extra damage is just compensating for the slowly deploy time, and the half-assed damage reduction doesn't do much but make it hurt a little less to be slower than molasses. Defense in TF2 relies more so on how much damage you can deal in a fight rather than how much HP you have; so, it makes sense for the gun to have a increased damage bonus AND a decreased spin-up time (the spin-up time being .438 seconds). This comes at a price of being slow, AND being slow to spin-down (1.432 seconds). This isn't as brain-dead as it appears, either. This weapon rewards the kind of Heavy who's very observant and plans ahead; if the Heavy doesn't do so, then the extra damage won't save him from a demo-medic team during a uber push. Though if the Heavy is smart enough, all he needs is a Medic and he'll be a real piece of work. Now, the Buffalo Steak Sandvich (BSS) is a fun, gimmicky weapon, but man I missed getting myself some minicrits on the fly. Unfortunately, as much as I wanna get myself some good ol' minicrits whenever I want, I think it would be OP if that went unchecked. So, to limit how much damage it can deal, I figured something simple as increasing ammo consumption will greatly reduce how much damage can be done in a single 5 second burst of bullets. You'd also be more glassy as well with that vulnerability penalty. It would be a interesting niche that the other lunchbox items have not filled yet; as opposed to giving the Heavy a source of healing, he gets a source of damage instead. You have the Fists of Steel with their pretty good damage reduction, the Killer Gloves with their crits, the GRU with their speed, and the Holiday Spirit for their weaponized LOLs. So what do the Warrior's Spirit get? Extra damage and 50 HP on kill. Honestly, I think that's terrible for two reasons. First, it's commonly a bad idea to go all-out melee as a Heavy; your high health isn't enough to make up for the bigger hitbox and slower movement speed, and you only deal 85 damage per second with those claws. A minigun and second banana is a better idea, to be quite frank. Second, its debatable if the Warrior's Spirit goes with anything, even with the Buffalo Steak; would you really like to take 55% extra damage for a damage output less than your minigun? So, I decided to make something out of this; a high damage utility that rewards putting yourself in a unfavorable position for the chance to increase the rate you get lunchbox items. Essentially, it's an Ubersaw for the Heavy; for each hit, you shave off 10 seconds from the recharge time. If you hit often enough and live, you'd get another Sandvich in 3 seconds. The downside to this melee weapon, on top of being a big and slow target as always, the wearer gets -30 HP. I will be frank, this is a lot better than the 30% damage vulnerability; it would be like the Heavy had somewhere between 210-250 HP with these claws on, anyway."
318,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[IG] Reserve Shooter (Pyro/Soldier Secondary),3,8ffns6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/8ffns6/ig_reserve_shooter_pyrosoldier_secondary/,2018-04-28 08:42:17,(+) On Hit: Marks enemy for death. (-) -40% damage penalty. (-) +20% damage vulnerability on wearer per marked target. (Hidden) Takes 20 damage to trigger the marked for death effect. (Hidden) Can only mark 3 enemies at a time. So now it's a more utility weapon that can help support your team and help in 1v1s. The downside is that you take a lot more damage as well.

On Heavy the shotgun does not have a movement speed and spin-up penalty so it's good to use while mobile, specifically going to and from combat. The Sandvich is very different from the shotgun but many consider it an upgrade. We can't buff the shotgun, of course, but I think it could be easier to switch to.~~ ------- **Possible sandvich slot** ~~This is a popular idea that aims to make the shotgun more viable to use and provides combo potential with other secondaries. However it lacks the decision between choosing secondaries and buffs the class significantly which would be overpowered in pubs.~~ ----------- - **Weapon Ideas:** -------- **Heavy Picnic** *Defensive supportive sandvich* ~~**Place down and share a lunchbox which can heal multiple players for a total of 305 health**~~ ~~*-30% recharge rate*~~ ~~*Health packs do not restore health and only recharge 50% of meter*~~ - No alt-fire to throw, you can only place it down in a 4 second taunt. - Enemies can use this but they cannot destroy it. This makes it powerful on the front lines (as they can't destroy it) but only if you can maintain your ground, or else they can use it. - All health packs only charge the recharge meter for half of their effect on health. For example, medium health kits recharge 25% of the meter. - I am very open to changes for the recharge rate and whether it should be independent on spawn like the gas passer. It's hard to tell in-game. -------- **Tank minigun** *Inspired from the workshop item* ~~**+20% damage resistance while spun up**~~ ~~**No movement speed penalty while spun up moving vertically without aiming**~~ ~~*-50% movement speed while spun up and aiming*~~ - I should probably explain the movement speed stats. The bottom of the minigun model on the workshop resembles the tracks on a tank. While moving your crosshair you pick up the minigun so it's tracks are off the ground. -------- **Taunt idea: WIP name** *Description: Sometimes it's important to take a break from the fight and enjoy some fine Russian literature.* ~~**Starting animation: Heavy pulls out his glasses and a book, crouches down, and opens the book.**~~ ~~Looping taunt: Heavy flips pages and adjusts glasses all while moving his eyes and making comments.~~ - Voice lines: Positive and negative voice lines from ~~*Ending animation: Reverse of starting animation*~~ - Voice lines: ""I've yet to meet one that can outsmart bullet."" - I think this is a great idea and it shines light on TF2 lore and also has comedic value because the Heavy is often viewed as unintelligent in-game. -------- - **Weapon balance changes:** ------- **Dalokoh's bar** *This change makes the weapon more fun and useful while maintaining balance.* ~~**Health gained can provide overheal**~~ ~~**-50% recharge time**~~ ~~*-75% health gained*~~ ~~Alt-fire: Share a small health pack which can overheal teammates~~ - How this works: This can only heal 100 health maximum, so eating at full health will provide overheal up to 400. At low health it's a direct downgrade to stock but it does charge faster, but not fast enough to offset the healing penalty similar to the second banana. ~~ - Basically if you eat this while at low health it will be a downgrade. This is mean't to be used before combat or when a medic isn't on the team. -------- **Family business** *This weapon is supposed to promote a fat scout playstyle, but the fact that it's a direct upgrade is bad design. It only has stats present while active which is okay for most weapons but the point of this is supposed to be focused on damage, similar to the problem with the warrior's spirit. My suggestion would counter the shotgun to make it more restricted to access but more powerful while active, making it the opposite of equipping the panic attack on heavy* ~~**On kill: Gain a 3 second speed boost**~~ ~~**+15% firing speed**~~ ~~*Cannot holster until all clips have been fired or a kill has been made*~~ ~~*-60% deploy speed*~~ ~~*-30% holster speed*~~ ~~Trivia: The switch speeds are the reverse of the degreaser~~ -------- **Warrior's spirit** *This weapon suffers from the same problem as the family business in the fact that it currently only has stats while active but promotes the playstyle of using it primarily. Especially when paired with the buffalo steak sandvich, which even fits the aesthetic and of course the set, which includes the brass beast* ~~**+30% damage bonus**~~ ~~**+50 health restored on kill**~~ ~~*-25 health on wearer*~~ - Changes: Replaced 30% damage vulnerability with -25 health on wearer.

Technically it should be 438 but I wanted to round it a bit. ------ **Brass beast** *This weapon needs to be changed because frankly it sucks. I think a more defensive minigun is a great idea, however it needs a playstyle that isn't boring and leaves you a sitting duck* ~~**10 health regenerated per second while spun up**~~ ~~**+20% damage bonus**~~ ~~*25% less accurate*~~ ~~*-30% spin-up speed*~~ ~~*-50% movement speed while deployed*~~ - The damage resistance is replaced with the health regeneration because it allows teams to coordinate attacks with the same damage but .

(-) -50% clip size. (-) -33% reload speed. So the reserve shooter has never really been in a good place. As much as the mini-crit on airborne enemies is cool and all, it's pretty hard to balance. Instead, I just opted for a straight damage boost. It still has a similar role but it doesn't require a gimmicky and somewhat unreliable combo. I also gave it 1 less clip and reduced the reload speed to give it an actual downside. **Panic Attack** (+) +50% deploy speed. (+) +35% damage bonus. (-) -20% pellets per shot. (-) Damage decreases per shot after initial firing. The problem I have with the panic attack is the extra pellet spread. 15 bullets spread out further which can make getting maximum damage pretty hard. Making it more damage but less bullets makes it not as spread out and actually requires more precision. Also I changed the increasing spread to a decreasing damage to make it more consistant. **Mantreads** (+) +75% resistance to knockback and movement impairing effects. (+) +200% air control on wearer. (+) +25% damage resistance while rocket jumping. (+) Deal 3x falling damage to enemies you land on. (-) +20% fall damage vulnerability. So the mantreads are pretty okay now, though it still isn't worth using over stock or gunboats in a serious game. All the upsides are a bit situational. That's why I added the damage resistance, it isn't as situational. It makes bombing in a lot more powerful and could be pretty useful for troldiering too. Though out of fear that it could be too powerful, I added a downside that punishes you for not making the best of a rocket jump but also makes the stomp a bit more powerful. **Buff Banner** (+) Fill a rage meter by dealing 350 damage. (+) Activate rage to give all teammates in a radius a mini-crit boost and +25% reload speed. So a lot of people have requested a passive effect on the buff banner, though I had a different idea. What if it had the effect of charging faster? It makes it able to be used more often and can help with getting a lot of pushes in. Also I added a reload buff to the rage to make it that much better. **Battalion's Backup** (+) +20 max health on wearer. (+) Fill a rage meter by dealing 500 damage. (+) Activate rage to give all teammates within a radius +35% damage resistance, +50% sentry resistance, +30% knockback resistance, and immunity to crits and mini-crits. So the backup is already a pretty damn good banner, though it needs a slight boost. I made it refill with 100 less damage. Also I gave the rage an immunity to mini-crits on top of the crits. Also I added a knockback resistance to help with pushing so you don't get knocked around as much. **Concheror** (+) Up to +5 healing per second on wearer. (+) Fill a rage meter by dealing 500 damage. (+) Activate rage to give all teammates in a radius +40% healing on hit, a speed boost, and +25 healing per second (goes into overheal). Like the backup, this just needed a slight boost. I increased the damage needed to 500 just for neatness sake. I then increased max healing to 5 per second because it looks better. Also the healing on hit was increased by 5% and a healing aura was added in the rage. **Righteous Bison** (+) Increased base damage to 55. (+) Added knocks enemies back on hit. (-) Damage activation reduced to every 2 ticks. (-) Added -20% damage per penetrated target. The one thing I kind of liked about the pre-JI bison was the damage consistency. Relying on getting multiple hits to do anywhere close to good damage. Making it consistent and removing the multi hit crap is good. Though add knockback on hit which will allow multiple hits, you just need to hit them precisely. Also I added less damage per penetration because without it, it could do 110 damage on someone in 2 hits."

My new stats (70% Longer range and Bullet Vulnerability) gives the wrench actual upsides and a dangerous downside. The longer range (which is the same range as the Disciplinary Action) allows a multitude of opportunities for the Engineer. The Engineer can be safer from spy situations, take down a sapper faster, pick up a building sooner, upgrade or maintain from a safer distance, and so much more. The downside is very, very punishing however. 25% Bullet Damage Vulnerability means that using a shotgun, instead of a 90 point blank hit, the wrench will give the engineer a devastating 112 damage point blank (there could also be more likelihood of embarrassing sentry suicides too). I would've done regular damage vulnerability but it would've been too much since a single sticky and rocket would've killed an engineer, and bullets haven't been much of a threat to an experienced engineer. These stats would encourage a more 'safe than sorry' playstyle where the Engineer would spend more time protecting his buildings rather than trying to create short-term offensive style placements that the Jag is good at. What do you guys think? Is the upside too op? Is the downside too harsh? Is it just as uninteresting as the old version?"

The Warrior's Spirit isn't one of those weapons. Since its creation, the weapon has consistently been ranked as heavies worst melee option, if not the worst weapon currently in the game. The concept of the weapon is simple: deal more melee damage, at the cost of taking more damage. A flawed concept seeing how you only deal more MELEE damage while you take increase damage from ALL sources. I have decided to alter the weapon quiet a bit, while still taking into consideration heavy's massive health pool. You still deal more melee damage, but you also gain a movement speed bonus as your get injured (similar to the Escape Plan). However, in exchange for being a better melee fighter overall, you will receive less overheal from medics.* &amp;nbsp; &gt;You still deal 85 damage per swing with this weapon. You still can kill a medic in two swings, but you are still required to hit 175+ health classes three or more times to kill them (if you are not using the Buffalo Steak Sandvich). &amp;nbsp; &gt; The speed increase work similar to the Escape plan, in that every time you hit a 20% health lost threshold you gain a speed boost. I will list the speed boost gained per health values below: 375 - 241: No change in speed. 240 - 181: 10% increase in speed. From 77% to 84.7%. 180 - 121: 20% increase in speed. From 77% to 92.4%. 120 - 61: 40% increase in speed. From 77% to 107.8%. 60 - 1: 60% increase in speed. From 77% to 132.2%. &amp;nbsp; &gt;The ""50% maximum overheal on wearer"" stat applies even if you don't have the weapon active. This stat keeps the weapon from being used all the time for a general escape tool. Sure, you can use it to get out of sticky situation if you health is low and you can avoid enemy fire. You will, however, need to give up 75 (150) extra health in exchange for the extra speed, making you weaker in general engagements. &amp;nbsp; &gt;There is the possible issue concerning the quick-fix. Due to receiving no overheal from the quick-fix, medic's using the weapon can build up their ubercharge faster than normal. However, I think the lack of overheal you gain from the quick-fix balances this issue out a bit. If you disagree, then please comment below. &amp;nbsp; &gt;The ""No random critical hits"" stat is self-explanatory. Weapon that deal extra damage, especially melee weapons, shouldn't be allowed to deal random critical hits. &amp;nbsp; &gt;No, the Buffalo Steak Sandvich speed boost does not stack with this weapon's speed boost. You still receive the mini-crits and increase damage vulnerability from the Steak though. You can use the mini-crits to two shot any class except a heavy. You can also use the increase damage vulnerability from the steak in order to lower your health faster, allowing you to run faster as a result. You should still be careful, since you are still a big target and damage vulnerability is a double-edge sword when it comes to gaining the speed boost. ***** &amp;nbsp; And that's it. I do hope you enjoyed my rework of the Warrior's Spirit. If you have any questions, criticism, or just want to suggest a change, then please comment below. I look forward to seeing and replying to all of your comment's. Thank you and have a great day. "

So what do the Warrior's Spirit get? Extra damage and 50 HP on kill. Honestly, I think that's terrible for two reasons. First, it's commonly a bad idea to go all-out melee as a Heavy; your high health isn't enough to make up for the bigger hitbox and slower movement speed, and you only deal 85 damage per second with those claws. A minigun and second banana is a better idea, to be quite frank. Second, its debatable if the Warrior's Spirit goes with anything, even with the Buffalo Steak; would you really like to take 55% extra damage for a damage output less than your minigun? So, I decided to make something out of this; a high damage utility that rewards putting yourself in a unfavorable position for the chance to increase the rate you get lunchbox items. Essentially, it's an Ubersaw for the Heavy; for each hit, you shave off 10 seconds from the recharge time. If you hit often enough and live, you'd get another Sandvich in 3 seconds. The downside to this melee weapon, on top of being a big and slow target as always, the wearer gets -30 HP. I will be frank, this is a lot better than the 30% damage vulnerability; it would be like the Heavy had somewhere between 210-250 HP with these claws on, anyway."

Although I will be balancing around competitive, some adjustments will be made for casual. NOTE: I will NOT touch the Boston Basher itself, as keeping such a unique gimmick while nerfing it in terms of utility is hard to do. Also, it's the reference point of these balances. I will also not touch the Atomizer as I believe that the recent Blue Moon fix has caused it to be balanced (subjective). --- **Candy Cane** *Level 25 Bat* ~~**On Kill: A small health pack is dropped.**~~ ~~**+50% health from packs on wearer**~~ ~~*15% explosive damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ As of right now, the Candy Cane's explosive damage vulnerability means he can be one shot by every explosive. To ease this, the numbers has changed from 25% to 15% (94 effective health vs 106 effective health against explosives), and 50% additional health is gained back from health packs. Scout will no longer die to a direct grenade, but can still die to an almost fully ramp-upped rocket. The additional health gained from health packs increases the effectiveness of the small health packs, as well as making that one scout that doesn't stick as close to the team make medium packs more worthwhile. --- **Fan O' War** *Level 5 Gunbai* ~~**Crits whenever it would normally mini-crit**~~ ~~**On Hit: One enemy at a time is marked for death, causing all damage taken to be mini-crits**~~ ~~**This weapon deploys and holsters 30% faster**~~ ~~*-65% damage penalty*~~ The Fan O' War has a great upside for a very bad downside. Being able to make an enemy take more damage is great, but having to get into melee range to do so is not (you should just meat-shot them at that point). Increasing the Scout's speed is completely out of the question, so the deploy and holster speeds were changed. Being able to quickly switch to and from the Fan O' War will allow Scout to be able to use the mini-crits faster, being able to finish off the first enemy much quicker if he can engage with that first hit (135% damage + ramp-up). Instead of making it easier to do its job, it's now slightly more rewarding. The damage penalty was changed from 75% to 65% (9 to 12) in the unlikely case where you're out of ammo and only have your melee. The first hit will deal only 1/3 of the stock bat's damage, but the rest will deal equal damage. --- **Sandman** *Level 15 Bat* ~~**Alt-Fire: Launches a ball that slows opponents**~~ ~~**On Kill: Currently held ball is a guaranteed critical**~~ ~~*-15 max health on wearer*~~ ~~Change: Baseball deals -35% less damage.~~ The Sandman is one-of-two of Scout's melees that utilize a projectile for their main gimmick. I won't be changing the slow (which changes based on how far the ball has travelled? Or is that just the amount of time?), but I'll make some small changes to increase its viability. According to the wiki, a critical baseball increases the slow duration by 2 seconds. With this rework, scoring a kill will guarantee an extra two seconds of slow (minimum 3 seconds) on an enemy on your next encounter... if you still have your ball. This change may seem to present two options: use the ball to engage a slowed enemy with a slight advantage, or fight evenly with a health disadvantage for a longer slow later. However, a ball lasts for 3 seconds on enemy hit and can be picked up during this time. This allows players who can position themselves well to not only engage a slowed enemy, but still earn that longer slow later. Just a note: critical baseballs will now deal 30 damage instead of 45 due to the damage change. --- **Sun-on-a-Stick** *Level 10 RIFT Fire Mace* ~~**100% crits vs burning players**~~ ~~**+25% fire damage resistance while deployed**~~ ~~**On Hit: Lights enemy on fire for 6s**~~ ~~*-20% swing speed*~~ ~~*-15% damage penalty*~~ ~~*This weapon holsters 60% slower*~~ As of right now, the Sun-on-a-Stick is useless unless there is a Pyro on your team. After all, having a melee weapon that only functions as a worse melee weapon is almost useless unless it's used in conjunction with another weapon. With this rework, the Sun-on-a-Stick can light enemies on fire (dealing a total of 78 damage over 6s, including the initial 30 damage melee hit) and crit them without the assistance of another weapon. Two swings + two ticks of afterburn is enough to kill any 125-health mercenary, as long as you can get into melee range. The swing speed penalty makes this two-hit combo only saves 0.05 seconds compared to 2-shotting with the Scattergun, as it overall has slightly lower less DPS (150 to the Scattergun's theoretically highest 168). However, the frequency of the hits and consistency of the damage allows killing unbuffed enemies easier (not including afterburn, 3 hits kills all unbuffed mercenaries with the exception of Heavy, who needs 4 hits). The downside to having this strong melee is 1) it's a melee, and 2) switching back to your other weapons takes much longer. --- **Wrap Assassin** *Level 15 Bat* ~~**Alt-Fire: Launches a festive ornament that shatters causing bleed**~~ ~~**+25% increase in recharge rate**~~ ~~*-65% damage penalty*~~ ~~Change: Bleed is now based on how long the bauble has travelled, like the Sandman.~~ ~~Change: Shattered baubles can now also cause bleed damage.~~ ~~Change: Baubles deal -35% less damage.~~ The Wrap Assassin offers very little downside in comparison to the Sandman, but doesn't have a very strong projectile. Its increased recharge rate and shorter moon-shot distance (giving a critical hit) just seem better on paper. Its bleed is also consistent, giving no incentive to use it at longer ranges (aside from being out of range with the Scattergun). Giving it similar effect properties as the Sandman will encourage using it at longer ranges (2-7 seconds of bleed). Allowing the shatter of the bauble to deal bleed damage will allow the Scout to hit himself with the bleed to help Medic build uber, like the Boston Basher (although not as controlled. And yes, you can hit yourself with the bauble... it's easier than hitting yourself with the smaller radius of the default Flare Gun)."

It's the only one that gives Pyro movement speed, and doesn't come with the same downsides as the Escape Plan or the GRU (doesn't reduce health and doesn't require low health). You can put the Powerjack away before taking damage and still have your base 175 health. This rework allows the Pyro to move faster with the Powerjack out regardless if you're in battle or not, but it comes with a health penalty. This gives Pyro an effective 160 health regardless if he has the melee out (with the current Powerjack, effective health while deployed is 140). The speed boost would allows Pyro to finish off enemies and get away quickly, as the active and passive speed boosts can stack (+15 and +15, +30% max to avoid speeding Pyros). The healing stat was removed because the overall health penalty was added, and it wouldn't have been as rewarding as the new speed boost. As a side note, the -15 health penalty is quite small. It could/should be increased to -20 or -25, as those represent the numbers around the halfway point of the Powerjack's current damage vulnerability while active. (3/7 and 4/7 when compared with the -35 effective health). --- **The Backscratcher** *Level 10 Garden Rake* ~~**+25% damage bonus**~~ ~~**+50 health restored on melee kill**~~ ~~**+50% health from packs on wearer**~~ ~~*-75% health from healers on wearer*~~ This change is to cement the Backscratcher's identity as the ""Health"" option for Pyro and the Powerjack's identity as the ""Speed"" option for Pyro. As of right now, there is no reason to use the Backscratcher's damage bonus over the Flamethrower. However, having another way to recover health aside from health packs would prove quite useful with how slow everything heals you."

If you can aim you can get higher Burst Damage, 200 Damage in a version quick Succession. However Punishes Missing greatly. **Ali Baba Wee Booties** ~~**Speed Bonus now does not Require a Shield**~~ ~~**Added: 33% More Health Gained from Health Packs**~~ ~~*Added: 66% Less Healing from Healers (This Includes the Crossbow)*~~ I didn't have an entire problem with Pre Meet your Match Booties. but i completely understand they needed a Nerf. Moving Faster than Pyros with 300 Health with Overheal? Yeah, that's unacceptable. (We'll talk about that again later). So now, You can move Faster AND get more Health from Health Packs. But you can't really be a Pocket. Even Better for Demoknight and Great for Sticky Flank. but not good for being the Core. **Loose Cannon** ~~*Removed Faster Projectile Speed*~~ ~~**Increased Base Explosion Damage from 60-80**~~ Removing a Stat that doesn't work and making the over all Lower DPS higher. Now if i did the Math correctly. The Double Donk with do 150 Damage now. that means you can kill a Medic with it. Considering how Skill Based this Weapon is. I like it, but overall. the lower DPS only allowing up to 130-ish....which isn't much But i believe Being able to kill a Medic very fast and Two Shotting a Heavy is much better. **Base Jumper** ~~**Added: Take No Fall Damage after Chute is Retracted**~~ ~~**Added: Deploying Chute while Charging will Launch the User into the Air**~~ I understand the nerfs....on Soldier.......On Demo it made the worst Primary even Worse. So these would be Secret Upsides that only work on Demoman. Plus now it actually has a point with a Shield. **Iron Bomber** ~~*Added: 25% Damage Penalty Towards Buildings*~~ A simple Nerf. Not the Worst, But its not longer a Straight Upgrade **Stickies** ~~*Base Damage Reduced from 120 - 85*~~ ~~*Clip Size reduce from 8 to 6*~~ I don't have a Problem with Sticky Spamming in its entirely. I just have a problem with it being so OP. So reducing the Damage and Clip size should at LEASE be a Step in the right Direction. **The Scottish Resistance** ~~**Reduced Arm Time penalty from 0.8 to 0.4**~~ ~~*Added: 15% Slower Reload*~~ Making it just a little better on offense and a Little Worse at Defense. Simple as that. **The Chargin Targe** ~~**Added: 30% Less Knockback on Wearer**~~ ~~**Added: Up to 2 Health Regenerated on Wearer**~~ ~~**Increased Explosive Resistance to 40%**~~ ~~*Reduce Fire Resistance to 40%*~~ Honestly, The Targe is probably my most used Demoman secondary and even i think its a little Underwhelming. Now it should be on Par with the Nerfed Stickies. **The Tide Turner** ~~**Resistances Raised from 15% - 20%**~~ ~~**Tweaked Charge Lost on Damage from 1 to 1 To 2 to 1**~~ If Valve just wants this shield to pure Utility, Fine. But it just feels a little Counter productive. Now you can tank changes much easier and just resist a little more. Now you may be asking, why Buff the Resistances by very little? To put it Simply, Now you get More Charges and More Shield Damage or Full Turning Control for Half of the Targes Resistances. **All Swords** ~~*Holster and Deploy Penalties reduced from 100% to 75%*~~ Minor, but it makes them just a little better for Regular Demoman. and Make Uber Building with the Zatoichi Faster **The Eyelander** (Plus Reskins) ~~**Reduced Health Penalty from 25 to 20**~~ ~~*Added: No Overheal on Wearer*~~ As Stated, Going as Fast as Scout with 300+ Health with Overheal and the Power of Stickies is frankly Wrong. As i know, People would say its Skill. But it still not something that should Exist. However as a little bonus. You can't be Quickscoped anymore. **Scottsman Skullcutter** ~~**Extra Range Range boosted from 37% to 70%**~~ ~~*Deploy and Holster Penalties Remain Unchanged**~~ ~~*Added: 30% Slower Swing Speed*~~ Its a Heavy Axe that actually slows you down when you take it out. So it has longer range, But Deploys and Swings slower. But have the Range of the Disciplinary Action and Extra Damage. So it Balances out **The Ullapool Caber** ~~**Increased Base Explosion Damage raised to 85**~~ ~~**Removed Broken Caber Mechanic**~~ ~~**Reduced Deploy Penalty from 100% to 50%**~~ ~~**User Can now Strafe while Knockback by Self Explosion**~~ ~~*Removed Damage Ramp up and Extra Melee hit*~~ ~~*Added: 50% Slower Holster*~~ ~~*Increased Self Damage from 52 to 60*~~ So now rather than one Big Boom, You get less powerful more Consistent Explosions. making it an Actual Melee Weapon. It swings Slower and you do hurt yourself, so its not an Upgrade nor a Downgrade anymore. **The Claidheahm Mor** ~~**Increased Range from 37% to 70%**~~ ~~**Added: Deals Critical Hits While Blast Jumping**~~ ~~*Holster and Deploy Penalties remain Unchanged*~~ ~~*Damage Vulnerability Increased from 15% to 20%*~~ Don't need to Split it into two Sections. This may be a little too good. But again, Who doesn't wanna Come out of nowhere and Slice Someones head like the end of a Bad movie? **The Persian Persuader** ~~**Removed Ammo Penalties**~~ ~~**Kills Reload 50% of the Users Current Clip Size for both Primary and Secondary Weapons**~~ ~~**Increased Charge Gained on Hit increased from 20% to 25%**~~ ~~*Added: 20% Slower Swing*~~ ~~*Killed Enemies Only Drop Small Ammo Packs*~~ When you get right down to it, The Ammo Penalties down make sense. From what i can gather, They were added so People would know that this is a Demoknight Weapon only.....But wouldn't the Upsides be enough? They don't work without a Shield in the first place. its just downsides for the sake of Downsides. So now this Weapon Benefits both. Infact this would be a Very powerful Hybrid knight Weapon. Now at the end of the day, Take my suggestions with a grain of Salt. i'm only one guy with my own Opinions. but i do Appreciate Constructive Feedback."

In exchange, you are now more vulnerable to explosive damage and your melee defense is weakened.* &amp;nbsp; &gt;This weapon will only remove the following debuffs: afterburn, bleeding, marked for death, Jarate, and Mad Milk. &amp;nbsp; &gt;The weapon will only gain a sample if your remove one of the above mention debuffs from a teammate. To encourage teamwork, I have included the ability to heal teammates for 50 health when you remove a debuff(s). Removing multiple debuffs will not increase or stack the 50 health heal. &amp;nbsp; &gt;Removing a debuff(s) will give you a sample. If a teammate has multiple debuffs on them, you only gain 1 sample when you remove the debuffs. You will not gain a sample if you Alt-fire on a teammate suffering from a self-inflicted debuff (escape plan, boston Basher, ect..). &amp;nbsp; &gt;Gain a sample will decrease the duration of debuffs on you by 20%. Your medi-guns healing rate is also increased by 1.2 health per second for each sample. After gaining 5 samples, your healing rate is increased by 6 health per second and you are now immune to debuffs. &amp;nbsp; &gt;Having this weapon equipped will increase the amount of damage you receive from explosive damage by 15%. This stat is to combat the amount of healing power a medic can gain from using this weapon. You are now much more vulnerable to bombing or spam, however you can still possible dodge the extra damage unlike hitscan. &amp;nbsp; &gt;You now only deal 48.75 (49) damage with this weapon. Getting a crit will not be enough to kill higher health classes like demo or pyro. You now have to rely more on your primary or teammates for self-defense. &amp;nbsp; &gt;I am aware that Caduceus isn't the Greek god of medicine(that being Asclepius) or even a Greek God at all, but I kinda want to pay homage to the fact that Caduceus staff is used incorrectly to symbolize medicine. Kinda like how the character medic isn't really a doctor, but is the class centered around healing. ***** &amp;nbsp; And that is it. I hope you enjoyed my idea for a new medic melee.

I think the recently Controversy from Mr. Paladin is Hypocritical as hell. Unlike Spy, Engis Sentry has to go Down for him to get the Crits, Which keep in mind can cost you the game. No, My Problem stems from the fact that the gun itself is rather boring, Its only Two Stats. Crits when Sentry is Destroyed and 50% Clip Size, its rather boring, and While i don't think its Overpowered, Its still a Straight Upgrade 50% of the time. So i decided to Spice it up. Making it more interesting, slightly worse. but overall the Concept remains the same. **The Widowmaker** ~~*Increased Cost of Shots from 30 Metal to 40 Metal*~~ a simple nerf, Means you only get 5 Shots and is more Punishing if you fuck up. Can't be as Spammed at Medium-Long Range. **The Pomson 6000** ~~**Added: Laser Penetrates Targets**~~ ~~**Added: For Every Target Penetrated, User Receives up to 20 Health Depending on Damage**~~ ~~*Removed Uber and Cloak Drain*~~ I despise this Weapon. If you're that close to hit a Medic, Why not just use Your Shotgun to kill him or even your Melee? An Engineer shouldn't be Suiciding for the Med, That's a Solly or Demo's job. Now this new version is more for Chokepoints, Hitting three People could help sustain yourself when you have no Dispenser up. However unlike the Black Box, you're much Squishier. **The Rescue Ranger** ~~*Added: No Metal from Dispensers while Active*~~ I understand the JI Nerf, But it doesn't really matter when you have a Dispenser, Another Minor Nerf but it stops an Engineer from being able to make his Sentry near unkillable.........speaking of **The Wrangler** ~~**Reduced Healing reduction from 66% to 33%**~~ ~~*Reduced Shield Resistance from 66% to 33%*~~ ~~*Reduced Firing Speed buff from 2.0 to 1.5*~~ ~~*Now Shield Disappears After tanking 600 Damage*~~ This Weapon is Disgusting, and the Only Engineer weapon i would truly Call Overpowered nowadays. Level 1,2,3 or Mini? doesn't matter, its too strong no matter the building. Now this makes its significantly worse and the Pegs it needed to be knocked down. **Short Circuit** ~~**Increased Primary Fires Range to a that of a Standard Melee Weapon**~~ ~~**Increased Primary Fire Damage to 15**~~ ~~**Increased Secondary Damage from 20 to 30**~~ ~~*Decreased Secondary Fire Rate from 0.5 seconds to 0.75 Damage*~~ Making it a better Weapon but Slightly worse at Utility........Or maybe better because it means you can time it better Vs Solly's. But consider this Weapons Unnecessary Hate so i don't entirely know. **The Southern Hospitality** ~~**Added: 100% Damage Versus Buildings**~~ ~~**Removed Fire Vulnerability**~~ ~~*Added: 30% Bullet Vulnerability*~~ This turns it from a Mostly Straight Upgrade to a more Spy Oriented Wrench, You can take Sappers out in One hit and make him Bleed, But he can take you out better with His Revolver. Also Scouts, Heavies and Shotguns too but if you play it well that shouldn't be a problem. **The Gunslinger** ~~*Added: 25% Slower Repair Rate*~~ Just makes the Gunslinger Worse for keeping one up. I know a lot of people were Confused by being able to Repair them. But This way there's not Invincible. Also makes you a slightly worse Team Player. **The Jag** ~~**Removed Damage Penalty**~~ ~~*Increased Repair Penalty from 20% to 30%*~~ I don't like Wrenches being Balanced around Melee Combat, They're not what a Wrench should be doing. I know the Jag is still one of the most Powerful Weapons in the game and I love it too. but it needs just a little Tweaking. **The Eureka Effect** ~~**Reduced Construction Penalty from 50% to 25%**~~ ~~**Added: 20% Faster Heal Rate**~~ ~~**Users Metal is Automatically Refill When Teleporting to Spawn**~~ ~~*Now Costs 50 Metal to Teleport*~~ With Meet your Match Update, a lot of people were content to just move on and say ""Good Enough"". But compared to the Jag and Gunslinger, its.....Underwhelming, The Teleporters Costing Less and Teleporting really is only to Speed it up........Which the Jag already does. So let's speed it up, and kinda be the reverse Jag. Some may say this is Overpowered but i think it should be Fine. Constructive Feedback is appreciated~ "

Gradually lowers to 5% at Maximum Distance*~~ ~~*Removed Spun Up Resistance*~~ Its meant to be the Ambush Minigun. But for some reason Valve......Really doesn't know what to do with this Gun. There's the fact that the Slowdown is Sparatic, The Resistance went from Useful to useless with the MyM Update. Taking the easy route rather than adding.....say an Overheal penalty? and the Fact that the Downsides completely counter the main point of the Weapon. Yeah you can slowdown the enemies, Too bad by the Time you Spin up and start shooting, they can just kill you or already escape in that time. This Version is meant to be an Ambush Gun. You spin up around the corner and they in for a world of hurt. **The Brass Beast** ~~**Added: 25% Faster Firing Speed**~~ ~~**Added: 40% More Accurate**~~ ~~**Reduced Spin Up Penalty from 50% to 33%**~~~ ~~**Reduce Movement Speed Penalty from 60% to 40%**~~ ~~*Removed the Damage Resistance*~~ ~~*Added: No Healing from Mediguns While Spun Up*~~ The BB is the One gun i'm fine with being situational for Defense and not that Great on Offense. Now with 20% More Damage, it Fires Faster and more Accurate, at the Cost of a Medic. Might be a little too Powerful, But considering it was mostly Useless for 5 Years, semi good for One, and back to Useless. I wouldn't complain. **The Tomislav** Before saying my Idea's, Just keep in mind its been confirmed that the TF2 Team does not like how Mobile and Offensive the Gun makes Heavy. so with that in your Mind ~~**Added: 40% Less Damage Falloff**~~ ~~**Removed 20% Slower Firing Speed**~~ ~~*Removed Faster Spin Up*~~ ~~*Added: 15% Damage Penalty*~~ ~~*No Damage Ramp Up*~~ This makes it more of a Range Minigun. So rather than the Enforcer Minigun i can't help but feel we're gonna get, This makes it Unique. **The Hue Long Heater** ~~**Ring Of Fire now Induces Knockback in the Air (Not on the ground Forever)**~~ ~~**Added: Fireworks Mode: After Dealing 1000 Damage, Pressing the Reload key while Spun Up will Cause the Users Bullets to ignite Targets, Time Scaling on Damage**~~ ~~*Removed Damage Bonus*~~ ~~Changed: 10% Damage Penalty to 15% Damage Penalty to Non Burning Players~~ After watching an Undisguised Spy jump over your pocket so easily.......I've never touched this Weapon and still refuse to. This semi rework makes it like the Soda Popper and Heatmans Heattaker. Making you Detour Spies, but not Invincible from them. Not as good for Ranged Combat, But near godly for Crowd Control. **The Dalakohs Bar** ~~**Small Health Kits thrown with this Weapon Can be Used by The User, This does not give the user the Extra Health**~~ This weapon is mostly fine, The new Upside is to give it an Edge over the Banana. **The Buffalo Steak Sandvich** ~~**Effects now Last until the User Switches Away**~~ ~~**Now Heals for 50 Health**~~ ~~**User no longer Take Extra Damage While Under the Effects**~~ ~~*User is Now Marked for Death for Ten Seconds After Switching away*~~ I do feel a little bad, The Reason its Banned is due to an Oversight by Valve and Now i believe its gonna get Nerfed hard soon despite how Useless in every other situation is. This Version makes it worse for Rollouts, but better for Melee Heavy, as niche as it is. Plus its still a Medium Med kit. and Unlike the Old GRU, You can't just Switch away, You still have to wait 15 seconds before you can even pull out your minigun. **The Family Business** ~~The Old Stats of this Weapon have been Removed and Have been Replaced with the Following~~ ~~**On Hit: Gain up to 70 Health Depending on Damage, Can Transfer into Overheal**~~ ~~**Weapon Deals 33% More Damage While Being Healed**~~ ~~**Overheal Doesn't Decay While Active**~~ ~~*25% Slower Reload Speed while Not Being Healed*~~ ~~*66% Less Health from Health Kits on Wearer*~~ I I know this could just be put on another Weapon, But its Called the ~~Family~~ Business, So why not make it a more Team Oriented Shotgun, I know Heavy Shouldn't be using Shotguns so this is more Fat Scout but keeping with the Combo~ **The Second Banana** ~~*Reduced Recharge from 10 Seconds to 15 Seconds*~~ Its still 400 Health in the Time it takes the Sandvich to recharge So it Balances out. **Killing Gloves of Boxing** ~~**Added: This Weapon Holsters and Deploys 50% Faster**~~ ~~*Increased Firing Speed Penalty from 20% to 30%*~~ Minor Tweaks that make this Weapon better, Combined with the Extra Range they allow you to pull out a Quick Cheeky Kill. But are worse for Prolonged Melee Fights **The Warriors Spirit** ~~**Removed Damage Vulnerability**~~ ~~**Raised Health on Kill from 50 to 150**~~ ~~*Added: HonorBound: If Weapon is Holstered without making a Kill, User Loses 100 Health*~~ ~~*Added: Debuffs Last Twice as Long While Active (And Switching doesn't Shorten that Timer)*~~ I imagine this would be......Really Good wth the Steak i proposed, Weak to Pyros and just good Dodging, But if he lands that hit....ouch. I know this turns it into a Zatoichi with a Damage Bonus....but its Heavy. Not exactly gonna have the easiest time.... **The Eviction Notice** ~~Changed Speed Boost on Hit to Receive a Speed Boost When you take Damage~~ ~~**Lowered Damage Penalty from 60% to 45%**~~ ~~**Removed Health Drain Mechanic**~~ ~~*Removed Faster Move Speed*~~ ~~*Added: User Cannot be Healed While Active*~~ Its.....so.....Pointless, Ever Since Tough Break i've never understood the point of the Weapon. If they didn't want Heavies running Faster....Why not just plain reverse it? Well, This Version keeps the Escape Idea and Getting Up in Peoples face. A Three Second Speed Boost no matter what Damage, Giving it Slight Rollout Potential as you can take fall Damage. Overpowered? No, As most likely when you pull it out you'll be at Low Health. Meaning if you can do great damage He can't escape, **The Holiday Punch** ~~**Added: The Third Hit in a Row Will Crit**~~ ~~**Added: Deals Crits while Airbourne**~~ ~~*Added: 50% Damage Penalty*~~ The Holiday Punch is a joke Weapon......and Just giving it more Crit-ability but making it a worse Melee Weapon overall.

Lonely? Don't be! Order your very own Death Robot Kit and build your own heavily-armed robot buddy today!* ~~Replaces the Sentry Gun with a Soldier Robot~~ ~~*+50% build time on Soldier Robot*~~ ~~*+50% metal required to build Soldier Robot*~~ ~~*+10% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ The Steel Pardner is a heavily mechanized wrench, with numerous small appliances attached to it with wires, electrical tape, and with an antenna sticking off the side. For most purposes it is functionally identical to the Wrench. Its main advantage is its ability to construct Soldier Robots. These are team-colored, friendly versions of the very same mechanical copies of the Soldier from Mann vs Machine. They cost 150 metal to build and take 15 seconds to build, 7.5 if hit with the wrench. Soldier Robots are outwardly similar to their MvM equivalents. Painted in the color of your team, and with the same mouse-over overlay (plus status monitor) as any other building, they will detect enemies within regular Sentry Gun range and attack, firing rockets until the enemy is dead. They have a loadout of 4 rockets in the clip and 30 reserve, and when out of ammo will use their Shovel. They'll try to reload any time they can. They can be upgraded just like any other building; this doesn't change their model but does give them better aim. Level 1 robots have Normal level tracking, Level 2 robots have Hard level tracking and +10 speed, and Level 3 have Expert level tracking and +20 health. The Soldier Robot cannot capture points and does not give or take crits on any weapons. Soldier Robots are vulnerable to sapping just like any other kind of building. Soldier Robots' most useful ability is to be commanded. Normally, they will follow you as if you were a bomb carrying robot, attacking any enemies nearby. If you right-click on the environment or a player with the Steel Pardner, you may send the Soldier Robot to guard a spot, attack a specific enemy regardless of range, or even follow an ally instead. The robot has unique voice lines for obeying orders, killing enemies, following you, and other occurrences. Pressing Reload cancels any current orders (making the Soldier Robot follow you again) and if the robot finishes a kill order or its bodyguard target dies it'll go back to following you. Upon your death, regardless of what orders it might currently have, it will run back to the resupply cabinet to wait for you, putting out a unique voice line to indicate this to teammates. It has a camera in the upper right section of the screen, where you can see what it's doing. This camera will gradually get more and more static-overlain as it takes damage until the robot is destroyed, where it will show a ""NO SIGNAL"" screen. The Steel Pardner is overall meant to provide an alternate combat Engineer role. Instead of getting into the thick of it with shotgun and Mini-Sentry fire, the Engineer will command his robot from the back line or use it as a bodyguard for himself or an ally, such as a Medic. Because he has less durability, he is highly vulnerable to being killed, forcing him to tactically utilize his Soldier Robot to succeed."

Leave them mostly Untouched for Demoknight, But giving them Unique and Maybe Viable roles as Regular Demo.

This comes at the cost of turning control during a charge and being unable to fill up your charge meter through kills.* &amp;nbsp; &gt;Uses the same model. No real changes needed &amp;nbsp; &gt;This weapon will still give you a 10% speed boost. This is to allow demo-knights to be able to combat faster classes. You will also still receive a 25 health bonus from the boots. &amp;nbsp; &gt;The reduction in knockback and airblast vulnerability is to allow demo-knights to have a tool against pyros and explosive classes. These classes can interrupt a demo-knights charge and knock him of course. While you will still be able to stop a charging demo-knight if you aim correctly and time it right, you can not longer just juggle him or airblast him to get a easy kill. With this weapon, demo-knights have a easier time dealing or escaping these classes. These stats, however, will only come into effect if you have a shield equipped. &amp;nbsp; &gt;In exchange for better defensive and offensive capabilities, you will lose the ability to fill up your charge meter through kills. You also lose the ability to have better control over your charge. This separates the two boot weapons of demoman into their own separate weapons: The Ali Baba's Wee Booties are the boots you now use to deal with pyros and explosive classes. The Bootlegger are the boots you use to have more mobility and have more possible chances of charging. ***** &amp;nbsp; And that is it. I do hope you enjoy this rework. I originally wanted to make a brand new melee for demo-knights, but I scrapped the idea. I decided to take the stats I came up with for the melee, and rework one of Demoman's existing weapons. I tried to go for a more simpler, but precise rework for this weapon. This rework gives demo-knights more options when concerning their loadout, instead of just deciding if they want to go full demo-knight or use a grenade launcher alongside a shield. Now they can decide if they want to be more mobile or be more resistant to knockback. If you have any questions, criticism, or just want to suggest a change, then please comment below. I look forward to reading all of your comment. Thank you and have a great day. &amp;nbsp; Edit: replace the stat ""+25 max health on wearer"" with the stat ""+10% faster move speed on wearer"". Edit2: remove the stat ""40% increase in charge impact damage"" and replace it with the ""+25 max health on wearer"". Lowered the knockback and airblast resistance stat by 10%."
353,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[IG] Heavy Balance Ideas,10,7v1i1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/7v1i1c/ig_heavy_balance_ideas/,2018-02-04 06:34:27,"Heavy, everyone's favorite ol chap, except when it comes to playing him. Heavy is pretty boring, no special class abilities (other than i guess the sandwich), unlocks are pretty mediocre other than the meta, and he's slow. I'm not going to attempt to fix the core class, but i can make the unlocks better. Hopefully valve will actually balance more than 2 weapons for the class they were trying to fix this time around. **All Miniguns** (+) No longer have to rev down to switch off weapons. Spinning down takes quite a while and makes switching weapons that much harder. Now you can now heal your medic or yourself quicker. It might also make the shotgun more viable, though I'll get to that later. **Natascha** (+) Slowdown now is a flat 50% less at close and 10% less at max range (1% less per 25.6 HUs). (+) +50% max ammo capacity. (-) -25% damage penalty. (-) -30% less accurate. So valve seems to be a bit confused about what they want to do with this weapon. The slowdown effect at cost of damage makes it seem like a support weapon but the resistance makes it more defensive. It's also pretty annoying due to how big speed is in this game. So my idea is to change the slow to be a bit better and work with the remaining stats. Speed now is a percentage rather than a set speed that people are dropped to. 50% is only going to be worse on heavy and soldier but better for other classes disregarding unlocks. Also i replaced the resistance with extra ammo for no real reason, it just seems like something they could add back. I also replaced the spin up with an accuracy penalty so you can get out support faster but are less effective at range. Overall it's less annoying but a bit more useful. **Brass Beast** (+) +20% firing speed. (+) +20% damage resistance while spun up. (-) -60% spin up speed. (-) -50% max overheal on wearer. So the brass beast is pretty damn bad in it's current state. I originally wanted to make it better with it's melee oriented set, but i couldn't think of any way to do it without a complete rework. I instead went for this. Instead of more damage it's more firing speed, this means more dps but you chew through ammo faster. I also reverted the changes to the damage resistance and made it a flat damage resistance regardless of health. The spin up speed was dropped a bit just to compensate a small amount. Also less overheal so you aren't too powerful with a medic, likely the reason that it was nerfed in the beginning. **Huo-Long Heater** (+) On Kill: Create a fiery explosion that ignites enemies in a radius. (+) +35% fire resistance while active. (-) -15% damage penalty. (-) -50% afterburn duration. First thing you'll notice is that i ditched the ring of flames crap, I've rarely had times where it helped me and it only serves to drain your ammo. Now you can light enemies on fire but not directly, you have to get a kill in a group to do it, so it's relatively balanced. Though, the afterburn now only lasts 5 seconds, so even that isn't too bad. Also you have a fire resistance so you can fend off pyro's pretty well. **""All"" Shotguns** (+) Dealt damage will return to you as health (caps at 40). This will give heavy a healing option when he is not using a lunchbox. You might think that it could entirely outclass the dalokohs bar, but that would be wrong. You still have to do damage to get health and the bar gives better immediate health and doesn't require going into combat. This requires you to do damage but still gives you some reward for it. You still can't heal your medic, but that's the downside for getting a damaging option. **Family Business** (+) +20% movespeed while active. (+) +33% clip size. (-) -20% damage penalty. (-) -15% damage vulnerability while active. (-) -30% switch speed. (-) Does not give health on hit. This gives it a role of rollout/escape weapon to use for extra speed at cost of damage. You also take extra damage similar to the old GRU and EN so it's more balanced. Also you get no healing on hit so there is still some more intensive to use the shotgun. If your wondering how it wouldn't be as op as the old speed weapons, you give up a much more important slot to get the speed. **Dalokohs Bar** (+) Gain an extra 50 max health for 30 seconds. (+) +66% faster recharge time. (+) +40% faster consumption speed. (-) -66% healing. (-) Thrown bar only heals as a small health pack. (Hidden) Can overheal you again. The only change here is that you eat the bar faster. This means quick heals which will benefit a solo heavy style of play. Also the faster eating helps it to compete with the new healing shotguns. **Buffalo Steak Sandvich** (+) Consume to get the following effects until you holster your melee: - +35% faster movement speed. - Mini-crits on your melee weapons. - -15% damage vulnerability. - -50% holster speed on melee. (-) Only drops a small health pack. There is a bit to go over here. Firstly you can make the effects last as long as you want, no need to keep eating your sandvich. You can also switch off to end the effects at any time but will be punished with a holster penalty. There is also slightly less damage vulnerability when using it. To compensate for all this, you can't heal your medic as much. It's banned in comp due to giving a free rollout and being able to still heal your medic. Now you get a free rollout but cannot heal your medic as effectively, making it balanced. **Second Banana** (+) +50% faster recharge. (-) -33% healing effect. (=) Dropped banana will cause enemies and you to slip. This will make it more unique in design if not a bit more gimmicky. You can use this banana to mess with enemies and do whatever mischievous thing you want with them. I'm not sure the extent of it, mostly environmental kills and pushing into sentries. You can also use it to give you a little speed boost to get ahead, though it wouldn't be too much. **Killing Gloves of Boxing** (+) On Kill: 5 seconds of 100% critical hit chance. (-) -20% firing speed. (-) No random critical hits. It's a nerf that won't effect much except for it's niche uses in casual. Even there i barely see it used except for something I'll mention in a minute. With the ease of switching off your minigun, using this as a finisher would be easy anyway. And as for heavy boxing, it's not decided by luck anymore, making it more fair on crit servers. **Gloves of Running Urgently** (+) +35% move speed while active (activates only after .5 second of being deployed). (-) Max health drains by 6 a second while active and regenerates when put away (same conditions as before). (-) -25% damage penalty. So you might wonder why the conditions only apply after a short amount of time. Well, it's all about the instant health drain when deployed. That was likely put in to stop people from quick switching to get bursts of speed while not draining as much health. I think removing the instant health drain is necessary and would make it better. I also lowered the drain rate so it's not as crippling but still noticable. Oh and the holster penalty is gone, just another buff so it's not garbage. **Eviction Notice** (+) +50% faster firing speed. (+) Gain a 5 second speed boost on hit. (+) +50% faster switch speed. (-) -60% damage penalty. I never was too keen on this weapon being a mini GRU, i would rather it be unique. So i got rid of the speed boost and health drain and added a switch speed buff. You also gain the speed for a bit longer which allows for more time to use it. Overall it's just not a miniature version of the gloves, that's just boring in my eyes. **Warrior's Spirit** (+) +30% damage bonus. (+) Crits when it would normally mini-crit. (+) +75 health gained on kill. (-) 30% damage vulnerability while active. (-) No random critical hits. This was put in a set to be used with the buffalo steak sandvich, so why not make it pair better with it. The extra damage helps with mini-crits, but 254 damage per hit would be devastating. You can 1 shot everything except for heavies and some overhealed classes. Even those would be a two shot, you could easily kill people. You still will take quite a lot of damage when using it, so be wary. Oh and the health gained on kill was decreased to be a bit more useful, though the crit thing is probably enough. Also no random crits because of the crit gimmick it now has."

The reason it was made originally was to Buff the Pyro's Damage, with the Damage buffed by nearly 30% since then its just used for W+M1 nowadays. this nearly complete rework makes it Holster a lot Faster and with longer Afterburn makes Combos better. **Phlogistinator** ~~**Removed Cannot Airblast Penalty**~~ ~~**Mmph Crits can Be Transferred to Other Weapons**~~ ~~**Mmph can be Built By all types of Damage**~~ ~~*Airblast only Destroys Projectiles*~~ ~~*Airblast Does 25% Less Knockback*~~ ~~*Added 15% Damage Penalty*~~ ~~*Cannot be Ubered While Under The Effects of Mmph*~~ A lot changed but thats kinda what the weapon is, Like the Black Box and Vaccinator. This weapon is OP in Casual but Terrible in Comp. (Those who Disagree go look at Juud0lfs Video) So this makes it so it has Airblast and can be good in comp but Worse in Pubs. **Dragons Fury** ~~*Reduced Projectile Size by 25%*~~ ~~*Cannot Be Used Underwater*~~ Two simple downsides to fix this weapon. Its OP, its stupidly easy to aim for a Higher DPS than stock. **The Flare Gun** ~~**Base Damage Increased from 30 to 45**~~ The Problem with the Flare Gun is that a Crit does 90 Damage, Which the Shotguns can achieve with Regular Damage. So this simple changes boosts the Crit to a whopping 135, Making it such more rewarding to aim it. **The Detonator** ~~**Reduced Damage Penalty from 25% to 20%**~~ ~~**Increased Explosion fro 110 Hu to 125 hu**~~ ~~**Reduced Self Damage from 50% to 35%**~~ Just plain made the Weapon better, made it easier to hit, do a little more damage and the Hop isn't as Devistating. simple as that **The Manmelter** ~~**Projectiles now Penetrate Players**~~ ~~**Can now gain Crits from Removing All Debuffs**~~ Simple changes to make it less situational~ **The Scorch Shot** ~~*Increased Damage Penalty from 35% to 50%*~~ ~~*Weapon Can no loner MiniCrit*~~ I hate having to make this weapon worst. i love this so much ; . ; But with the Damage Increased this one would be too Strong. so its meant for Spammability, so doing actual straight damage **The Gas Passer** ~~**Cut Recharge from 60 Seconds to 30 Seconds**~~ ~~**Reduced Damage Needed from 750 to 400**~~ ~~**Players Under the Effect of Gas are Now Considered Wet**~~ Again, Just making it better. Also cut to the Pyros from Genowhirls Update videos. **The Thermal Thruster** ~~**Reduced Holster Penalty from 120% to 20%**~~ ~~**Reduced Recharge Time from 15 Seconds to 10 Seconds**~~ ~~*Players Now Cannot Carry the CTF Intelligence or Pass Time Jack*~~ it almost seems the TF2 Team overcompensated for these Two Weapons. making the downsides too severe. Also i find Jetpack Pyros are really annoying with CTF **The Axtinguisher** ~~**Removed Damage Penalty and Deploy Penalty**~~ ~~*Added: 66% Damage Penalty on Non-Burning Players**~~ ~~*Added: On Hit: Extinguishes Enemies*~~ ~~*Added: 75% Slower Holster Speed*~~ There, now its a Finisher Weapon. but a Lieability when theres no one on Fire. Simple as that. **Homewrecker** ~~**Added: 30% Bullet Resistance While Active**~~ ~~**Added: 70% Knockback Resistance While Active**~~ ~~*Added: 100% Fire Vulnerability While Active*~~ ~~*Increased Damage Penalty Vs Players from 25% to 40%*~~ Makes it more Useful for taking out Sentry Nest but not as much if there's a fellow Pybro. and no i'm not removing the Damage Vs Sappers, i may of change the Scorch Shot but i will never change my baby. **Powerjack** ~~**Increased Health on Kill from 25 to 50**~~ ~~*Added: User's Max Speed is Decreased by 15%, Time Depending on how long Weapon was active. (One Second from every Two active)*~~ I wanted to give a Similar Downside like the GRU and EV but not as severe. Its not the worst but it certainly hurts. **The Backscratcher** ~~Upsides and Downsides now only are in effect while Active~~ ~~*Added: 100% Slower Holster time*~~ Its one of the few weapons with an Active upside and Active Downside that is semi unfair. When Fighting a Pyro are you really gonna know when a Pyro is gonna receive much more health. and the Holster time is so its not a Straight Upgrade AND so you can't just quick switch in a fire fight. **The Sharpened Volcano Fragment** ~~**Added: 35% Damage Resistance while Active**~~ ~~**Added: Afterburn From This Weapon Cuts Healing/Uber Building By Half**~~ ~~*Added: On Miss: Ignite Yourself, MMphMhph!*~~ This Weapons Idea isn't stupid, Pyro has a Primary that Ignites, Secondaries that Ignite, Why not a Melee? The problem lies with that being its only Upside. so lets give it more with another Downside. **The Third Degree** ~~**Added: Up to 4 Health Regenerated while Active**~~ ~~**Added: On Hit: Steal the Enemies Over, Up to 200% The Pyros Health!**~~ ~~*Added: No Overheal from Medics on Wearer*~~ ~~*Added: 25% Damage Penalty*~~ a Rush stopper. But an Upside that doesn't all involve a Medic. Pretty useful but not great for combat **The Neon Annihilator** ~~**Changed Damage Penalty from Vs Players to Vs Dry Players**~~ Very minor Change, but this means it'll actually be 195 Crits. which is something not a lot of people actually know. **Hot Hand** ~~**Removed Damage penalty**~~ ~~**Added: The Fourth Consecutive Hit will Crit**~~ ~~**Speed Boost Increased from 1 Second to 3.5 Seconds**~~ Why not. its sooooo bad that it needs buffs Well that's all, Feedback is appreciated~"

362,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[IG] Scout Balance Ideas (again....),11,7keuw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/7keuw2/ig_scout_balance_ideas_again/,2017-12-18 04:00:28,"So this again... Listen, i like putting all my balance ideas into one post rather than multiple. Anyway i think you get the point. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Soda Popper** (+) +25% reload speed. (+) +50% firing speed. (+) On Hit: Build Hype (need 300 to fill). (-) -66% clip size. (-) -10% damage penalty. (Hidden) Hype gives seven extra air jumps but you have a 15% damage vulnerability. So this design makes you get hype a little bit faster but you do a bit less damage. You also can jump more but you will be much more vulnerable using it. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Shortstop** (+) +15% damage resistance while active. (+) +100% damage per pellet. (-) -34% clip size. (-) -60% bullets per shot. (-) +60% knockback vulnerability while active. So firstly i showed more of the stats than are on now (there are still some hidden ones). More importantly i removed the shove for a damage resistance because it is in a set that helps with survivability. I also increased the knockback. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Baby Face's Blaster** (+) Speed increases as health decreases (up to 174%). (-) -15% speed when at max health. (-) -34% clip size. There, a bfb that is fun, useful, and balanced (i think). You can move insanely fast but you have to be at low health, giving a real risk to it. It also damages rollouts unless you use a certain other weapon to help you... ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Back Scatter** (+) Mini-crits enemies from the back. (+) Gain a 3 second speed boost on back hit. (-) -34% clip size. (-) +20% bullet spread. Now there's more reward for the risk of hitting people from behind. You can use the speed boost to either keep getting several kills or use it to move around them if they turn around. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Mad Milk** (+) Throw milk to create a gas cloud that lingers for 5 seconds. (+) Enemies hit with the gas cloud will give 25% damage taken to health. (+) All friendly players entering the cloud are extinguished. Now it is a good area denial tool, similar to the gas passer. This time though, it actually has a useful effect. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Winger** (+) Take no falling damage while active. (+) +25% jump height while active. (-) -60% clip size. Now it doesn't have the useless damage bonus and instead has the stat from the original pocket pistol. This fits much better on the winger and makes it slightly more viable. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol** (+) +50% health from all sources while active. (-) -3 health drained per shot. (-) -33% switch speed. Now it pairs extremely well with the new bfb. You can shoot it to get low on health and move fast and then run to a health pack and basically get full hp. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Flying Guillotine** (+) Throw the guillotine to cause bleed damage on hit. (+) Mini-crits debuffed targets. (-) 11 second recharge. Now it can be used to do a tiny combo against any debuffed targets. This would pair extremely well with the wrap assassin now. Also i doubled the recharge so it's not as spammable and you can't mini-crit someone bleeding from your other guillotine. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Sandman** (+) Alt-fire: Launches a ball which marks players for death with time being based on distance traveled. (-) +25% damage vulnerability while active. Now you can use it to mark enemies from a distance rather than slow. It makes it not combo with the new guillotine as well. Also it now has an active effect rather than passive. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Candy Cane** (+) On kill with any weapon: Enemy drops a small health kit. (-) +25% fire vulnerability on wearer. Now the downside isn't as harsh. You will die quicker to pyro, but it's not as bad as being one shot by grenades and rockets. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Sun on a Stick** (+) Mini-crits burning enemies. (+) +75% fire resistance while active. (-) +15% bullet vulnerability while active. Now it's more for the self support use rather than the mostly useless crit gimmick. You die pretty slow to fire but you have a cost of taking much more bullet damage while it's active. Basically you can tank fires but only if no scouts or heavies (or snipers i guess) try to kill you. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Fan O'War** (+) On Hit: Mark enemies for death for 15 seconds. (+) +50% switch speed. (-) -90% damage penalty. Two big things have changed here. The biggest thing is you can mark multiple enemies for death. Also you can whip it out and put it away much faster. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Atomizer** (+) Grants a passive triple jump. (-) Triple jump costs 15 health to use. (-) -33% damage penalty. (Hidden) Placed on your back when holstered. This is pretty much the old design except a bit more punishing and you can tell when a scout is using it. Now you can't be super unpredictable with a third jump like before. "
363,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[IG] Weapon Rebalances (V 1.1) [Long],2,7lpu2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/7lpu2a/ig_weapon_rebalances_v_11_long/,2017-12-24 04:33:57,"[See the current version here](URL This is a work in progress Disclaimer: These are not official changes. These are simply my ideas, and yes, they are probably very broken and make weapons far too powerful. I am only throwing these ideas out there. I am open to ideas and constructive criticism. In fact, the main purpose of this is to have some creative solutions to balancing. Note: I am not an expert on balancing, as you can probably tell. I also didnt include weapons just because they are banned in competitive, because I dont know enough about the bans to understand how to fix the weapon. Also sorry for any grammatical/spelling errors. English is my first language. **Weapon Rebalances and Changes ** **General** &gt; Random Critical Hits Just remove random crits. However, the major upside to using a melee weapon is a higher crit chance. In order to help melee weapons, all melee weapons that normally get random crits will be able to combo, similar to the gunslinger. The first consecutive hit will be normal, second hit will mini-crit and the third will crit. Also, you should not be required to hold down attack, so you can have a short delay before attacking, to reward accuracy. &gt; Random Weapon Spread Two Options 1. Completely Remove it. (Makes it fairer) 2. Semi-Remove (Random weapon spread becomes deviation from the bullets path that it would take without random weapon spread.) This keeps it pseudo random. Not sure why you would really want this over no random weapon spread though. **Scout** &gt; Baby Faces Blaster Its fun to go fast, but the harsh penalties on the boost mechanic makes it frustrating to use. These changes still have the penalties, but make them less harsh. * Change the loss of boost on damage from 4% per point of damage to 1% per point of damage. * When boost is lost, have the boost meter go down rapidly instead of instantly going down. If the scout deals damage deals damage during this time, it stops draining. * Add: Boost drains over time (10% a second) &gt; Shortstop The shortstop is kind of weak. You simply dont have the same damage per shot or the increased damage ramp up. In addition, the shove is kind of useless. These changes are meant to make the shove more reliable, while provide a niche for the shortstop. * Shove should have a larger range, less wind up and the ability to cancel a reload with a shove (Which is a quality of life improvement when auto-reload is on). It should also be stronger, similar to a airblast with half-strength (Including weaker versions of the changes made in Jungle Inferno) * Add: Enemies pushed into the air by shove can be mini-crit by teammates while airborne. (The scout can not mini-crit his own victims) * Add: -10% air control when knocked in the air by knockback * Increase cooldown between shoves. &gt; Back Scatter The back scatter is pretty balanced, but the advantage is a very specific scenario and not significant enough to make a large difference. These changes are meant to make it to encourage flanking and more reliable while rewarding accuracy. * Add: Bullets go in a fixed spread pattern * Add: +15% Damage Bonus * Add: -33% Firing Speed (Makes it slower) * Add: -15% Reload Speed * Add: +100% Damage Falloff * Add: -50% Max Ammo * Remove: -20% Accuracy penalty &gt; Soda Popper This weapon is overpowered in 6s as it gives the scout 5 jumps to easily dodge rockets and grenades. This change forces the scout to careful when using the soda popper to dodge. * Add: Mid-air jumps after the double jump reduce the scouts max health by 10 health. Lowest health possible due to this is 25 (15 with sandman) Max Health regenerates at 5 health/second. * Change: Hype Mode lasts for 12 seconds (From 8 seconds) &gt; Pretty Boys Pocket Pistol This pistol is practically a straight upgrade. However, the current design is much better than before. So instead of nerfing it into the ground, nerfing another aspect of the weapon to make of more a trade off and to fill a certain niche. * Add: -33% Damage Penalty * Add: -25% Max Ammo * Change: +25% Firing Speed (Up from 15%) &gt; Flying Guillotine The Guillotine is not very lethal. It can potentially deal 90 damage, but enemies will usually retreat to get health before that, making it weak in pubs but overpower in 6s. It no longer has the cleaver combo with the sandman. The aim of this buff is to give it a new role: To engage or disengage enemies. * Add: Hits give a 1 second speed boost * Change: 25 Base Damage (From 50 Base Damage) &gt; Scout Melee (General) Bats launch things. * Add: +300% Ragdoll Velocity &gt; Sun-on-a-stick The Sun-on-a-stick is not very effective. It deals pitiful damage, and even with crit swings its rather weak for all the trouble you need to go to. The damage resistance is also not very helpful since you need it out. These changes allow you to be more effecting against burning enemies, and allow it to chain * Add: No random Crits. * Add: Critical Hits ignite nearby enemies * Add: +20% Swing Speed Penalty * Remove: +25% damage resistance from fire while this weapon is active. &gt; Fan O War This weapon is useless outside of MvM. For the benefit of getting mini-crits, you might as well shoot the enemy twice instead of risking getting close. These changes will help the scout to have a team supporting role with this weapon. * Add: +50% Switch to and switch from Speeds * Add: 1 Second speed boost up on successful hit (To aid with getting away) * Add: Creates an outline around the victim that can be seen through walls for 5 seconds (One at a time) * Change: Teammates can mini-crit the victim (Scout is unable to mini-crit his own victims with this) * Remove: Crits whenever it would normally mini-crit. &gt; Wrap Assassin This weapon deals very poor damage. The bauble deals pitiful damage, and bleed can be easily canceled with heal packs. The baubles cant be picked up again. There isnt much reason to use this weapon. These changes are designed to make this weapon more viable by dealing more damage. * Add: Can hold up to 3 baubles at a time * Add: Crits bleeding enemies. * Add: Shatter effect causes bleeding as well * Change: +40% recharge speed (Up from +25%) **Soldier** &gt; Liberty Launcher This weapon has a lot of interesting upsides, but none that really complement each other well. I think that the liberty launcher could be an effective combo weapon, especially given its item set. These changes reflect that. * Add: +25% Knockback while rocket jumping (Enemies receive more knockback) * Add: All attacks while rocket jumping are mini-crits (Even your shotgun or melee) * Add: +33% faster switch from and switch to speeds &gt; Buff Banner The buff banner is balanced, though there isnt much reason to use it over the banners unless you are team player, since it there is no passive benefit. This change adds a simple passive buff to give it more use. * Add: +10% damage against overheal (Allows you to get rid of enemies overheal buff more easily) &gt; Reserve Shooter After Jungle Inferno, this weapon was nerfed into the ground. And for good reason. But now, its pretty useless. Usually when someone is in a situation that you can mini-crit them, they are too far away. This change is supposed make it more viable and make it more skill based. * Add: +30% Accuracy * Add: -10% Damage Penalty * Add: -25% Reload Speed (Makes it slower) * Change: Cannot Mini-Crit Blast Jumping Players. &gt; Righteous Bison This weapon was thankfully reverted (Mostly). However, it is still weak, even if valve ups the firing speed to compensate for the small hitbox to make damage comparable to the same as pre-MYM levels (As pointed out by Soundsmith) After that would be fixed, just buff the damage. * Increase the firing speed to hits the same number of the times as pre-MYM * Add: +15% Damage &gt; Escape Plan The escape plan is really good. However, the main downside is supposed to be that it cant a viable weapon and should be only used to escape. However, the speed bonus can allow you to dodge during melee combat. This change prevents it from being used in melee combat. * Add: -50% Damage Penalty * Add: -20% Swing Speed Penalty &gt; Equalizer This weapon pales in comparison to the escape plan. The utility of the escape plan overshadows being better at combat. This change is to make it better at combat at low health to make it an effective option. * Add: Swing speed increases as health is lowered, up to twice the normal swing speed. &gt; Disciplinary Action This weapon has a much longer range than normal. This makes it really good for melee combat. I have to solutions: Simply keep it the way it is, but just list the longer range, or have the weapon use two separate ranges, one for hitting teammates, and one for hitting enemies. **Pyro** &gt; Manmelter This weapon is a weak secondary as the only way to get crits if the enemy team has a pyro. This makes it hard to be viable as it is extremely situational. I have two options to help remedy this. Design 1 makes it a more reliable damage dealer, while design 2 makes it into a more support focused with the ability to not use crits. Design 1 * Add: Can penetrate enemies * Add: +33% Damage * Add: After Penetrating enemies it deals mini-crits Design 2 * Add: Can penetrate enemies and teammates * Change: Primary Fire no longer uses crits automatically * Change: Alt-Fire: Fires with using crits (If they are stored) * Change: Projectile can extinguish teammates * Change: Anytime you extinguish a teammate, you get crits &gt; Thermal Thruster Its fun to be used, but it cant easily be used for bombing and it can be sluggish to use for mobility. Maybe this is to keep the denotator viable, but I dont think that should hurt this weapon. One option is to allow you to press a button, such as reload, and you can use it with any weapon equipped. I dont like that idea, as it has a custom taunt already. My idea should have a compromise. * Change: 0.7 Weapon holster time (Down from 1.1 seconds) &gt; Gas Passer This weapon has an interesting effect, but its long recharge time and lack of a secondary weapon hurt the weapons viability. The fact that charge isnt lost on death isnt exactly helping. Here are my thoughts on improving this weapon. * Add: Gas effect cannot to be removed or shortened in duration except by water * Add: Afterburn caused by the Gas effect can not be extinguished or shortened in duration except by water. * Remove: Gas meter isnt lost on death * Change: Half the required damage/time until a full recharge &gt; Axtinguisher A moment of silence for the Axtinguisher. It was nerfed for making the pyro too good at close range despite being a class designed to be close range? Anyway, these changes allow it to deal some serious damage while taking risks to use it. * Change: -50% Damage penalty against non-burning players (From 33% Damage Penalty) * Change: +15% Switch to speed bonus (From -75% Switch speed penalty) * Add: +50% Slower Holster Time * Add: Attacks Extinguish enemy players (Gets on crit and youre done) * Add: 20% Damage Vulnerability while Deployed &gt; Sharpened Volcano Fragment This weapon is worthless. Its so worthless, its hard to think of balance ideas. Here are several different ideas with a slight commentary. Option 1 * Add: On hit: Ignite and knock nearby enemies vertically into the air * Add: On Miss: Hit yourself. Idiot * Change: -33% Damage Penalty (From -20%) * Remove: Ignites players on hit This allows you to ignite several players and knock them back as well as being helpful for mobility. Option 2 (Stolen from Cosmic Afro) * Add: +33% Damage bonus on non-burning players * Change: -50% Damage Penalty on Burning players (From -20% Damage Penalty) This makes the sharpened volcano fragment into a burst damage ambush weapon Option 3 * Change: +20% Damage Bonus (From -20% Damage Penalty) * Add: Mini-crits Burning Players * Add: Player is ignited while deployed * Add: -50% Slower Holster Time * Add: No Random Crits This reverses the weapon completely. It becomes excellent at melee combat while making the player take damage over time and vulnerable to enemy pyros weapons. &gt; Third Degree This weapon is literally a straight upgrade to stock. Not a very helpful one though. These changes make this weapon into an effective medic killer while differentiating itself from stock. * Add: Crits enemies in a medic chain * Add: 20% Slower Swing Speed * Add: 20% Damage Vulnerability * Add: 20% Slower Holster Time &gt; Hot Hand This weapon is a meme weapon, so its understandable bad. However, due to its weak nature and fun with slapping (Especially since it swings twice), here is a buff to make the weapon a bit better while keeping it a meme. * Add: +10% Faster Swing Speed * Change: -20% Damage (It is actually -15% despite the description saying -20%) **Demoman** &gt; Loch-n-Load This weapons only use is as a crutch. The only upside besides easy to hit shots is a useless damage bonus against buildings. The stickybomb launcher is already amazing against buildings. These changes are meant to make it reward accuracy while not being too much of a crutch * Add: Mini-Crits while Blast Jumping * Add: Mini-Crits on enemies sent airborne by an explosion, grapple hook, or enemy attack. (Like the direct hit, includes air blast) * Add: Crits enemies sent airborne by an explosion, grapple hook, or enemy attack while blast jumping * Change: -50% Clip Size (From -75% Clip Size) * Change: -50% Blast Radius on non-critical and non-mini-crit attacks (From -25% Blast Radius) * Remove: +20% Damage Bonus Against Buildings * Add: -20% Slower Reload Speed &gt; Wee Booties and Bootleggers These weapons are pretty good on demoknight, but the +25 Health seems to small of a reason to give up the Grenade Launcher as when using stickybombs. This change is to encourage their use more. * Add: +200% Air Control &gt; Scottish Resistance This weapon is easily outclassed by the sticky bomb launcher because of the longer arm time. It cant simply be used in an offensive style. Because of this I have to designs: One that strengthen it defensively and increase the number of traps that can be made, and that weakens the defensive capabilities and reduces the penalties Option 1 * Add: 15% Damage Bonus * Change: +8 Max Pipe bombs (From +6) Option 2 * Change: +4 Max Pipe Bombs (From +6) * Change: +10% Firing speed (From +25%) * Change: 0.6 second Slower Arm Time (From 0.8 second slower arm time) &gt; Quickiebomb Launcher This weapon is pretty balanced. However, there is a damage penalty which makes sense? You want to prevent spamming, right? But since damage increases with charge, it counteracts at makes it deal damage. It isnt as effective as an anti-spam downside as it should be. The clip size penalty is already massive enough of a downside, so removing this mechanic should keep it balanced. * Remove: Up to +35% damage based on charge * Remove: -15% damage penalty &gt; Ullapool Caber Poor Ullapool Caber. It is basically useless. Its even slower to kill light classes than stock. The solution? Make it re-usable with a timer, similar to the new razorback and give it a way to be devastating while making it actually take skill. Also copy a beloved weapon. * Add: Crits while blast jumping * Add: Recharges after 30 seconds * Add: Crit Kills reduce recharge time by 33% * Add: 75% Slower Deploy Time * Remove: 100% Slower Deploy Time **Heavy** &gt; Natascha The slowdown makes this a pretty good anti-scout weapon but the weaker damage and slower spin up time penalties are quite significant. The damage resistance was nerfed in MYM, I guess as an attempt to allow snipers to one-shot overhealed heavies, even though the resistance affects attacks that drop below the threshold. These changes buff the resistance without affecting critical hits. (Critical damage is always Base Damage (Whatever type) + 2 x Critical Damage) * Change: 20% resistance to non-critical damage while spun up (From 20% damage resistance when spun up and health is less than 50% of max) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability &gt; Brass Beast The same changes as above, but with a slight increase in speed while spun up. * Change: 45% slower speed while spun up (From 60%) *Change: 20% resistance to non-critical damage while spun up (From 20% damage resistance when spun up and health is less than 50% of max) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability &gt; Buffalo Steak Sandwich This weapons speed boost is literally broken. It doesnt stack with the GRU, and it can be used to get the heavy to mid quicker with no disadvantage, which is broken in 5cp. However when used for its intended purpose, its quite weak. I have two fixes (And a combination of these two options) for the speed specifically, and stats to buff it. (Assuming Valve fixes the bugs with the speed boost interacting with the speed boost from the disciplinary action and the GRUs speed bonus) Speed Fix (Use one or a mixture both) Option 1: * Change: +25% Speed Bonus (From +35% Speed bonus) * Add: -50% speed penalty when the duration runs out and no kill was secured during the duration of the weapons use Option 2: * Add: Receive Speed boost for 3 seconds on kill * Remove: +35% Speed Bonus Option 3: * Add: Receive Speed boost for 3 seconds on kill * Change: +25% Speed Bonus (From +35% Speed bonus) * Add: -50% speed penalty when the duration runs out and no kill was secured during the duration of the weapons use Buffs (Regardless of Speed Fix) During the duration of the buff * Add: +5 seconds to the duration per kill * Change: 20% non-critical Damage Resistance (From 20% Damage Vulnerability) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability * Add: Unable to capture intelligence or capture points/payload * Add: -75% Healing from Healers (Like the Backscratcher) * Add: +300% Ragdoll Velocity on Kills These changes are made to make the heavy stronger while under the duration of the buff. You are already limited to melee weapons so having a damage vulnerability to all damage while only being able to deal melee damage made you a sitting duck. The critical damage vulnerability, removal of the ability to capture objectives and reduced healing from Medics and Dispensers remove the possibility of using the steak as a tool to tank damage. The added duration upon kill allows the heavy to continue the rampage. &gt; Warriors Spirit This weapon is pretty bad. Its hard to justify dealing more damage while taking more damage if you can only deal melee damage where as you can be attacked from any range. The health on kill is rarely a factor as well. * Add: Health on kill can overheal * Change: 20% Damage Vulnerability (From 30% Damage Vulnerability) **Engineer** &gt; Pomson 6000 The Pomson is bad. Its a pretty bad weapon with an unfair ability to drain bercharge and spy cloak. Its not fun to use or fun to fight. Here is an idea for a rework that doesnt have annoying mechanics and makes it more reliable. * Add: Projectiles penetrate enemies * Add: Projectiles ignite targets on hit * Change: Increase Projectile speed to 1600 Hu/s (60 Hu/s faster than Liberty Launcher) (From 1200 Hu/s) * Remove: On Hit: Victim loses up to 10% Medigun charge. * Remove On Hit: Victim loses up to 20% cloak. &gt; Rescue Ranger This weapon is really good. A little too good. It allows you to heal at a range, and even at a lower amount of metal then what you would do with a wrench. It also allows you to pick up buildings from afar. I dont think it should be cheaper to heal a building with this weapon than with a wrench when you can do it from a range, though to be fair, a wrench can heal more. I had 3 ideas for changine the Health to Metal Ratio: 1. Make it the same as the wrench 3:1, still quite a good deal (20 metal per bolt) 2. Make it significantly worse, 2:1 I think still fair, but might be a bit too much for some (30 metal per bolt) or 3. Something done the middle, with a ratio that uses a nice, even amount of metal: 2.4:1 (25 metal per bolt) * Change: 2.4:1 Health to metal ratio (25 metal per bolt) (From 4:1 (15 metal per bolt)) &gt; Wrangler This weapon is really good because of its shield. It can stop 66% of the incoming damage, bringing the effective health of the sentry up to 648. These nerfs are designed to weaken the defensive capabilities of this weapon. Option 1 * Change: Shield stops 25% of incoming damage Option 2 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage, but the damage only blocks damage from the front of the gun Option 3 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage, but damage blocked drains your metal at a ratio of 1:1 Option 4 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage but drains a meter that when empty, the shield doesnt activate until it is full again. The shield can absorb up to 250 damage before empty and it recharges at a rate of 16.6 points of damage a second while the shield is not active. (Takes 15 seconds to fully recharge) &gt; Short Circuit This weapon is quite balanced, but there are two problems. Primary fire is basically useless as it has toothpick range and secondary fire can be used a lot, especially with metal being restored with a dispenser. * Change: Alt-fire uses 20 metal per shot, plus 5 per projectile destroyed (From 10 per shot) * Change: Holding down primary fire creates a small arc of electricity that can connect from enemy to enemy (Think a chainsaw made of electricity that can link between enemies) &gt; Southern Hospitality This wrench isnt bad. Its just kind of boring. Its bleed on hit makes it sound like its good for spies, but the cloak shortens the duration of status effects. Also its risky to go into melee range of a spy. However, the fire vulnerability rarely is a factor. These changes are designed make it an effective counter for spy, but only for proactive engineers or teams with effective coordination. * Add: Applies an outline to the target on hit that can be seen through walls for 5 seconds (Shows even if cloaked) * Remove: 20% fire vulnerability * Add: Buildings have a 25% sapper vulnerability (Sappers deal 25% more damage and buildings are destroyed 25% faster from sappers) **Medic** &gt; Syringe Guns General Syringe Guns are bad. Sure, medic isnt meant for combat, but sometimes you need to be able to defend yourself. Its hard defend yourself with against even a spy, and the crossbow its just so good. Here are two suggestions to help make needle guns in general able to compete with the crossbow. * Change: Instead of having a clip and an ammo pool, replace the clip with pressure meter. Taking a shot removes ammo and reduces the pressure meter. Reloading refills the entire pressure meter. The pressure meter has enough to shoot 40 needles. So what would this change? Well the idea behind this is to make it so that you can automatically reload the needle gun when it is not active. This makes switching between healing and shooting easier. * Change: Projectile speed 1450 Hu/s (From 1000 Hu/s) About the same as the loose cannon. This makes the weapon more reliable. Even though the needle guns DPS is about 120 point blank, most shots will not hit. This makes it easier to defend yourself. Overdose This weapon is bad. You need to stop healing to make use of the speed boost so this makes it only good for running away with full Uber. Plus, you can heal a scout to fast. These changes make it helpful in more situations and to encourage medic to use it to go from patient to patient quicker and more often * Change: +10% Movement Speed (From Up to +20% based on bercharge while active) * Add: 20% Faster Overheal Decay &gt; Quick-Fix This weapon is overpowered in 6s. The healing rate is too much that the current disadvantages cant compete. * Add: 30% Faster Overheal Decay * Remove: +10% bercharge Rate &gt; Vaccinator This weapon is also overpowered in 6s, as it is very common to be fighting only one damage type at a time. These changes weaken the bercharge and buff the weapon to compensate for it * Change: bercharge no longer protects both medic and the target. The resistances is applied to healing target by default, only applying to the medic if they are not healing or the target already has the resistance for that type. * Remove: -33% bercharge rate on Overhealed patients. * Change: If bercharge is activated on the medic, the resistances do not disappear if you switch weapons (It will still disappear after the 2.5 seconds is up) &gt; Amputator This weapon pales in comparison to the bersaw or Vitasaw. And ever since the change the way regen works, it cant save you from afterburn. The medicating melody isnt very effective for healing as you need to keep pressing Alt-Fire (Or Taunt). These changes allow for the amputator and effective mass healing weapon with the cost of being more vulnerable * Change: +5 Healing per Second while deployed (Flat Rate) (Up from +3 Healing per second) * Change: Medicating Melody Range: 512 units (Up From 450 units) * Change: Medicating Melody loops, with a brief delay before the healing begins and before control is restored to player * Add: 15% Damage Penalty &gt; Solemn Vow This weapon isnt that great. You need to relay the information to your team, which does make sense, but the upside it too small outside of 6s. These changes allow it to help teammates in a radius while putting yourself at risk * Change: Allows you and teammates within 512 units to see enemy health while it is deployed * Add: Enemies can see your health * Add: 10% Damage Vulnerability **Sniper** &gt; Sniper Rifles General (Does not include Huntsman or Classic) Sniper Rifles are really good. However, it can be frustrating to lose a 1v1 against a sniper, a class that is supposed to be weak in close combat. This can frustrate some people. This change is supposed to weaken the sniper in close combat, while it will still reward a skilled sniper in close combat. * Change: Sniper Rifles have damage ramp up, from 50% damage at point blank up to full damage after 512 units. &gt; Sydney Sleeper and Jarate This change is less to these weapons and more to the Jarate effect. This change is to make these weapons more balanced in comp, namely 6s * Change: The Jarate effects mini-crits have damage fall-off &gt; Hitmans Heatmaker This weapon isnt bad, just situational. The focus seems to be meant to for helping the user to be efficient and to have a plan to kill everyone you meet. However, its more helpful in sniper duels. This changes is to make the focus better for killing multiple targets * Remove: +25% faster charge rate with focus * Add: +25% faster reload Speed with focus. &gt; Classic This weapon is awful. It tries to emulate the sniper rifle from Team Fortress Classic, however, it just leaves this weapon as just bad. You can see more while charging, but that is small potatoes for not being able to headshot unless you are fully charged. This weapon needs a redesign. This redesign is a more mobile rifle that can be used to easily reposition at the cost of slower DPS. * Add: No Damage Fall Off (See above) * Remove: Cannot headshot unless fully charged. * Add: Automatically charges at -66% Speed (Takes twice as long to charge) (No speed reduction here) * Change: Pressing primary fire shoots, pressing reload will go into a charging mode (What holding down normally does) Alt-Fire will go into charging mode and zoom in. * Add: Charge is not lost on unzoom or leaving charging mode (Though it is lost on weapon switch or shooting) * Add: Charging mode charges with -25% Speed (Compared to normal charge, not the auto charge) * Add: 50% Slower Reload * Change: -10% damage penalty (From -10% Damage penalty on body shot) Machina This weapon is popular for body shooting, because of 15% damage bonus. These changes are meant to help the piercing ability while rewarding accuracy. * Change: Shots penetrate players and damage players behind them (From Fully charged shots penetrate players and damage enemies behind them.) * Change: Shots that penetrate deal +30% More Damage (From Fully charged shots deal +15% damage.) * Add: Shots that penetrate deal damage in a radius Shahanshah This weapon is an interesting side grade. However, its benefit is only when you are in danger. This change is not change that, but to increase benefit when you are in that risky situation. * Change: +50% increase in damage when health is less than 50% of max. (From +25% increase in damage when health is less than 50% of max.) * Change: 50% decrease in damage when health is more than or equal to 50% of max. (From 25% decrease in damage when health is more than or equal to 50% of max.) **Spy** &gt; Disguise General Lets face it. Disguises hardly fool anyone, unless the spy is a master of deception. Below are two ideas to make disguises fit in more. However, I am skeptical of these ideas, as this will just make people always spy check as there are less ways to see if a player isnt a spy. * Add: Add key bindings to allow the spy to feign a shot with his disguises weapon. The shot would look just like the real thing and behave the same way (e.g. Explode animation would play, minigun would slowdown spy, scope would seem to move to the spys face), except it doesnt deal damage, knockback or any other effect. There would need to be a weapon for primary and alt-fire. However, the shot ignores any ammo restrictions, so if a careless spy isnt careful theyll be shooting 6 grenades from a grenade launcher. This is to make this new ability actually take some skill. * Add: If a teammates attack hits a disguised spy, the disguises health will appear to drain unless a shot is fatal. &gt; Enforcer This weapon is broken. The pierce doesnt even work half the time. These changes are to make this weapon have more similarities with older designs and turn this weapon into a close range revolver for a gun spy. * Change: +25% Damage Bonus (From +20% Damage Bonus while disguised) * Change: -10% Slower Firing Speed (From -20% Slower firing speed) * Add: Cannot not cloak while this weapon is deployed * Add: -50% Slower Holster Speed * Add: +25% Max Ramp-up (Like the scatter gun) * Add: -60% accuracy (Revolvers are already quite accurate, not sure how much this would change) * Add: +100% Damage Falloff * Remove: Attacks pierce and resist shield effects Diamondback This weapon is really good. Its a spy weapon that rewards you for doing spy things. Also, people are upset this weapon wasnt nerfed when the ambassador was. These changes are supposed to reduce the effective range of this weapon and weaken it. * Add: Crits have damage falloff. Red-Tape Recorder This weapon is pretty bad. Its far too slow to destroy stuff, just making it an annoyance. These changes are meant to make it easier to get away without an engineers teammates noticing you and to disable the buildings for longer after being removed, to make it more of a weapon that you use to prepare for a team push. * Add: Noise Created is 75% Quieter * Change: Disables sentry guns for 1.5 seconds after being removed (From 0.5 seconds) "

But i like these, Their balanced....i think, i can never tell with this place. I knew to avoid teaching Bad Habits and Avoiding affecting construction Boosts. The Judges Desicion: This is more of a Team Oriented Weapon, Yeah its the Dispensary Action and the Fan o War, but with more added. While its more defensively Oriented, It Teaches Good habits with Keeping Buildings up and Making your Team reach the Front line. And if you want, Suicide bomb the Medic. Fun for everyone The Gods Mighty Hammer: Yeah, its a Thor Reference, and Yeah, Its really only effective if there are Medics. But since there are always medics in Comp i don't think it'll be too situational..... Too Tirtly? No, as Bullet Vulnerability does affect Revolvers, So taking him out wouldn't be too hard.... Hells Wrath: Honestly, the idea of Engi carrying around a Hammer on Fire just sounded cool, so i went from there, Gives you three semi powerful Upsides, at the cost of damaging yourself overtime and being unable to heal it off with your dispenser. Or maybe, wasn't sure if it should've been higher or not.... While Extended Range with Engi can be risky, Slower Deploy is probably the most punishing on Engi. One second can mean the difference between A Building and Scrap. Better than the Jag/Gunslinger? Probably not, unless the entire TF2 meta as a whole shifted then those will always be the top two. Feedback is appreciated."
365,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,"[OP] ""Weapons Banned on Global Whitelist"" &lt;Multiple Classes and Slots&gt;",2,7n9vwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/7n9vwk/op_weapons_banned_on_global_whitelist_multiple/,2018-01-01 04:56:59,"I would like to email this to the TF Team but would like some feedback on it first to make sure that none of the changes are super outlandish. I have set it up like how the TF Team set up the blog post of proposed weapon changes a few months ago so that it includes some commentary on the weapon, the goal(s) of the changes, and changes themselves. Please bear with me since the document is very long. Please let me know below what you think. Also, please excuse the poor formatting, but it would take me a sentry to format all of these changes (see what I did there ;) **Reserve Shooter** Although the change in Jungle Inferno that reduced the viability of the weapon on Pyro was good for the balance of the weapon for Pyro, the weapon most likely will remain banned through testing due to how it allows the user to deal massive bonus damage onto enemies that are playing like they normally would at the cost of no serious penalty on top of faster switch and holster speed upsides. Goal: (Option 1) Reduce the major upside of the weapon so that it is more in-line with the downsides. (Option 2) Make the downsides of the weapon more in-line with the current upsides. Changes: (Option 1) -Changed Mini-crits targets launched airborne by explosions, grapple hooks or rocket packs upside to +25% damage vs targets launched airborne by explosions, grapple hooks or rocket packs -Added -15% damage vs targets not launched airborne Or (Option 2) -Added downside: User is marked for death while launched airborne by explosions, grapple hooks or rocket packs **Soda Popper** Although the change to the weapon made back in the Meet Your Match update that made it so that Hype can only be gained by dealing damage is good, the weapon is arguably just as good as the stock Scattergun in its base form and it has the incredibly useful Hype mode upside on top of that. The Hype mode also carries no penalties at all and allows the user to nearly completely negate damage taken from projectile based classes when used properly. Due to these reasons, the weapon will likely remain banned in Competitive. Goal: (Option 1) Make the weapon more in-line with the stock Scattergun with its stats. (Option 2) Make the Hype mode require more decision / thought on when / where to activate and how to manage the risk / reward of the effect (this is the same goal that you all had with the recent changes to the Crit-a-Cola). (Option 3) Make the user more predictable and easier for projectile based classes to attack while Hype mode is active. Changes: (Option 1) -Removed Hype mode and build hype on hit upsides (Option 2) -Added downside: While Hype mode is active: Each mid-air jump sets Marked-For-Death for 3 seconds (Option 3) -Added downside: While Hype mode is active: 15% slower move speed on wearer **Crit-a-Cola** While the recent changes to the weapon were a huge step in the right direction, the weapon will likely remain banned through testing in its current state due to how the user can deal massive bonus damage to enemies at will and enemies can only deal massive bonus damage to the user whenever the user chooses to be vulnerable. Goal: Make the upsides and downsides between the user and enemies equal. Changes: -Changed While effect is active: each attack mini-crits and sets Marked-For-Death for 5 seconds to While effect is active: Each attack mini-crits and user is Marked-For-Death **Flying Guillotine** Although it pains me to say it, the recent changes to the weapon made the weapon potentially more overpowered in Competitive due to the reasons that it is banned. The weapon will likely remain banned because it is currently able to be spammed out way too much, the weapon does not carry any real downside, and the weapon gives the Scout, a close to medium range class, a reliable and high damaging medium to long range weapon at little to no tradeoff (similar to the previous issue with the Ambassador in which it turned Spies into Snipers, but in this case turns Scout into a projectile based attacker). The recent long distance hits reduce recharge time upside made the problem of the weapon being a long range tool for the Scout that can be spammed out worse. Goal: (Option 1) Reduce the effective range of the weapon to something more reasonable and expected with the Scout (very similar to the recent Ambassador changes). (Option 2) Have the weapon act as an option for the Scout to have a decent damaging long range projectile based weapon at the cost of being less effective at close range. Changes: (Option 1) -Increased cooldown between cleavers from 6 to 8 seconds -Removed long distance hits reduce recharge time -Added downside: Damage dealt on impact and bleed time is affected by range (Damage on impact and bleed time begins to reduce beyond 512 world units + Deals only 20 damage on impact and does not cause bleed damage beyond 1200 world units) (Option 2) -Increased cooldown between cleavers from 6 to 8 seconds -Removed long distance hits reduce recharge time -Added downside: -15% damage dealt by primary and melee attacks **Mad Milk** Mad Milk is probably one of the most problematic weapons that is currently banned. The weapon will need either a complete rework or some serious nerfs to its upsides along with some additional downsides to make it truly fair to fight against and have fair trade offs. The ability to heal 60% of damage done and therefore being able to completely turn around fights for the user and the rest of the users team with ease at the almost negligible cost of no Pistol has warranted the weapon to be banned and likely remain banned. The weapon also does not carry any downside for the exceedingly good upside. Goal: (Option 1) Reduce the effectiveness of the weapon and make the weapon require more skill to use. (Option 2) Give the weapon completely new stats. Changes: (Option 1) -Changed Players heal 60% of the damage done to an enemy covered with milk upside to User heals 40% of the damage done to an enemy covered with milk -Added downside: Milk meter starts empty -Added downside: Spawning and resupply do not affect the Milk meter -Added upside: Milk meter builds with damage done and / or time (700 damage ; 60 seconds) (Option 2) -Change the stats completely **Pretty Boys Pocket Pistol** While the recent changes to the weapon made it a very viable option, the changes have made the weapon a bit too good under most scenarios. The weapon will likely stay banned in its current form because the tradeoff of a slightly smaller clip size in exchange for faster firing speed and significant health gained on hit is too good for the user. Goal: Make the downsides and tradeoff of the weapon more in-line with the upsides of the weapon. Changes: -Added downside: -50% max secondary ammo -Added downside: -25% damage penalty **Atomizer** While the weapon is nearly perfect how it currently is in my opinion, the weapon may remain banned through testing in its current state due to how the user can triple-jump the instant that the weapon is taken out, almost negating the fact that the weapon needs to be held out in order to gain the triple-jump. Goal: Make it so that the weapon must take some time to achieve its upside so that it is not used instantaneously in combat like it previously was. Changes: -The weapon must be fully deployed to triple-jump **Cow Mangler 5000** Although the recent buff to the weapon is mostly unnoticeable, the weapon has been banned due to it being too useful and not carrying any serious penalties for its useful upsides. While the ability to disable buildings for 4 seconds at the cost of dealing 20% damage to buildings and doing mini-crits whenever it would normally crit balances out fairly well, the upsides of it not requiring ammo and the charged shot that mini-crits players and sets them on fire do not have any serious downsides or tradeoffs which is why the weapon has been banned. Goal: Add downsides to make the upsides a fair tradeoff. Changes: -Added downside: -15% damage penalty -Added downside: User is Marked-For-Death while firing a charged shot and for 2 seconds afterword **Mantreads** The weapon is currently banned due to a bug and can otherwise be unbanned. Changes: -Fix bug (I dont know what the bug is and could not find it anywhere online) **Disciplinary Action** Like the Mad Milk, the Disciplinary Action is also probably one of the most problematic weapons that is currently banned. The weapon will need either a complete rework or some serious nerfs to its upsides along with some additional downsides to make it truly fair to fight against and have fair trade offs. The weapon is currently banned because of the ability to speed their team up in rollouts and pushes at the negligible cost of -25% damage. The weapon also has the longest melee range in the game even though it is not specified. Goal: (Option 1) Reduce the effectiveness of the weapon and make the weapon have a fair tradeoff of upsides for downsides. (Option 2) Give the weapon completely new stats. Changes: (Option 1) -Changed On Hit Teammate: Boosts both players speed for several seconds upside to On Hit Teammate: Gain a speed boost for several seconds -Added downside: -50% max overheal on wearer -Removed -25% damage penalty -Removed (hidden) range bonus (Option 2) -Change the stats completely **Dragons Fury** The weapon currently has projectiles that do not really match their visuals and with the Pyro class itself being changed drastically, the weapon will at least be temporarily banned. Goal: Make the weapon visually consistent. Changes: -Make projectiles and visuals match each other better. **Natascha** The weapon is often just situationally overpowered, but the situation that makes it overpowered crops up quite often. The ability to slow enemies at ease when the user and their team are pushed back to a last point at the cost of less damage and a slower spin up time is not a very fair trade off if it is used to slow enemies pushing onto the last point to make them very vulnerable as the rest of the users team attacks them and the user sits in the safety of their spawn. Due to this, the weapon has recently received a ban. Goal: Reduce the overall slow amount and slow range but lower the penalties in exchange. Changes: -Reduced overall slow amount -Reduced the range at which the slow does not apply from 1536 units to 1200 units (same as Ambassador headshot range) -Reduced damage penalty from -25% to -15% -Reduced slower spin up time downsides from 30% to 20% **Buffalo Steak Sandvich** It is funny to think that this weapon would be banned, but its move speed boost allows the user to get to mid fights very fast and with no real penalty. Due to this, the weapon will likely remain banned in its current state. Goal: Remove the move speed bonus, therefore removing the problems that it causes for the flow of the game, and balance the weapon better from there. Changes: -Removed move speed bonus after consuming -Removed (hidden) 20% damage vulnerability after consuming -Added upside: On kill after consuming: Gain a 5 second speed boost -Added upside: Melee range is increased after consuming **Fists of Steel** Although the recent nerf to the weapon making it so that healing and overhealing the user with the weapon deployed is less effective is good, the weapon may remain banned due to how the user can be heal buffed before taking the weapon out, partially negating the penalty if the weapon is taken out afterword. Due to this, the weapon will likely remain banned in its current state. Goal: Make it so that the downsides of the weapon cannot be bypassed but reduce them slightly to compensate. Changes: -The maximum overheal on wearer downside now applies passively when the weapon is equipped, not just when it is taken out or not -The health from healers on wearer downside now applies passively when the weapon is equipped, not just when it is taken out or not -Reduced maximum overheal on wearer downside from -40% to -30% -Removed 100% slower holster speed penalty **Rescue Ranger** Although the recent nerf to the weapon that made ranged repairs consume metal at a 4-to-1 health-to-metal ratio was good, it did not make much of a difference for the weapons overall balance in most cases, so the weapon remains very powerful. The ability to constantly heal buildings at close range just as effectively and in most cases more effectively than the users wrench at no serious penalty has warranted the weapon to be banned and likely remain banned. Goal: Reduce the effectiveness of healing buildings at close range and reduce the overall effectiveness of constantly healing buildings with bolts so that buildings are not indestructible with the weapon equipped. Changes: -Added downside: Bolts now heal buildings based on distance traveled (e.g. bolts that hit buildings within 512 units of the user heal only 20 health and bolts that hit buildings beyond 1200 units heal the maximum health, 60) -Increased health-to-metal ratio for ranged repairs from 4-to-1 to 3-to-1 (e.g. repairing 60 damage costs 20 metal) -Added downside: 25% slower reload speed penalty **Short Circuit** Although the nerf to the weapon made back in the Meet Your Match update that made each projectile attack cost -10 metal and then add -5 metal for each projectile destroyed was good, the weapon is still too strong when used effectively. In particular, using the weapon to protect buildings, usually sentries, can make them nearly indestructible for projectile based classes, the classes that specialize in dealing with Engineer buildings. The weapon can also completely shut down projectile based classes for the users team and in 1 v 1s with skillfully timed attacks. All of this at the cost of using very little metal in most cases is not very balanced. Due to this, the weapon will likely remain banned in its current state. Goal: Reduce the overall effectiveness of using the alt-fire of the weapon to constantly destroy projectiles and the amount that the weapon can be used but boost the effectiveness of the primary fire in exchange. Changes: -Increased ammo consumed per alt-fire attack from -10 to -20 -Increased ammo consumed per projectile destroyed from -5 to -10 -Increased cool down between alt-fire attacks from 0.5 to 0.75 seconds -Increased primary fire base damage from 10 to 20 **Wrangler** Although the weapon has been on the receiving end of nerfs to things such as the Sigafoo save over the years, the weapon remains a very powerful tool in the Engineers arsenal. While the ability that the user has to take manual control of their sentry at the cost of no Pistol and having their sentry disabled and vulnerable after being unwrangled for a few seconds balances out fairly well, the shield that reduces damage and repairs is what makes the weapon too powerful. The fact that the weapon can be taken out and the users sentry gun then gets 66% damage resistance from all sources is not fair to enemies that are pushing in to destroy the users buildings especially since the user can use their sentry gun to attack the enemies as they struggle to take down the sentry. While the 66% repair penalty on shielded sentries can come into play, the upsides of the shield outweigh the downsides. The weapon also becomes even more powerful when paired with other weapons like the Rescue Ranger as an example since the user can bring up a shield for their sentry gun, run away, and then teleport it to safety as it is tanking damage that it normally could not from the shield. Due to all of this, the weapon will likely remain banned in its current state. Goal: (Option 1) Make the shield easier to combat for enemies and less of a get out of jail free card for the users sentry. (Option 2) Make the shield easier to combat for enemies and require the user to carefully balance out their metal supply to keep their sentry shield alive. (Option 3) Redesign the shield aspect of the weapon so that it does not protect the sentry, but instead the user (I think Uncle Danes idea is interesting). Changes: (Option 1) -Reduced the damage that is reduced by the shield of wrangled sentries from 66% to 33% (just the damage reduction) -Added downside: Sentries that are unwrangled cannot be rewrangled until the sentry becomes active again (Option 2) -Reduced the damage and repairs that are reduced by the shield of wrangled sentries from 66% to 33% (both the damage reduction and repair reduction) -Added downside: Shield gained by wrangled sentries drains metal at a 1 to 1 damage taken to metal ratio -Added downside: Wrangled sentries gain no shield if the user has no metal -Added downside: Metal cannot be gained from dispensers while sentry is wrangled and / or disabled (Option 3) -Changed Wrangled sentries gain a shield that reduces damage and repairs by 66% upside to User gains a shield that reduces damage taken by 66% while sentry is wrangled -Added downside: If the users sentry is destroyed while wrangled or for the disabled period while unwrangled, the user is Marked-For-Death for 5 seconds **Quick-Fix** Like a few of the previously mentioned weapons, I think that the Quick-Fix is one of the most problematic weapons that is currently banned for multiple reasons. While the UberCharge of the weapon increasing the healing by 300%, being situationally worse than stock, and granting immunity to movement-impairing effects, being situationally better than stock, itself is fairly well balanced compared to that of the stock Medi Gun, the bonus heal rate and UberCharge rate at the cost of slightly less overheal is not a fair tradeoff. The bonus heal rate alone is high enough that it nearly negates the max overheal penalty and it completely outclasses all of the other Medi Guns healing. The bonus UberCharge rate is potentially game breaking because it causes one Medics UberCharge to always be higher than the others, and with the UberCharge itself being nearly the same as stock, it forces the other Medic to use the weapon as well. On top of this, the ability to mirror the blast jumps and shield charges of patients is also potentially game breaking due to it giving the user so much more mobility around maps and a better ability to pocket projectile based classes. Knowing all of this, the weapon needs some major changes or it will remain banned. Goal: Reduce the effectiveness of the weapons upsides, create fair tradeoffs for the upsides, and change the weapon so that it is equally fair to fight with and against. Changes: -Reduced bonus heal rate upside from +40% to +25% -Removed +10% UberCharge rate upside -Increased max overheal penalty from 50% to 75% -Added downside: User is Marked-For-Death while mirroring blast jumps and shield charges of patients -Added downside: 20% increase in push force taken from damage and airblast while mirroring blast jumps and shield charges of patients **Vaccinator** While the Vaccinator is very unique with its stats and niche, the weapon is a bit too powerful with lower player numbers. The amount of resistance on UberCharges allows the user and their target to nearly negate damage from the selected sources and with smaller player numbers, typically only one or two types of resistances will be needed. The less UberCharge rate on overhealed patients downside can be negated as well by having a player such as a Scout with a Boston Basher hurt themselves constantly and allows the user to further take advantage of the faster UberCharge rate upside. Games also tend to slow down when UberCharge is used with the weapon since multiple enemies must focus the Medic using the weapon to ensure that they can damage every other player effectively on the opposite team. All of this together makes for a combo of stats that are a bit too powerful in Competitive. Goal: Change the weapon so that games are not slowed down by it and it is not too powerful with lower player numbers. Changes: -Reduced faster UberCharge rate upside from +67% to +33% -Removed -33% UberCharge rate on overhealed patients downside -Changed UberCharge provides a 2.5 second resistance bubble that blocks 75% base damage and 100% crit damage of the selected type to the Medic and Patient to UberCharge provides a 2.5 second resistance bubble that blocks 100% crit damage of the selected type to the Medic and Patient, 50% base damage to the Patient, and 25% base damage to the Medic **Solemn Vow** While the ability to see enemy health and UberCharge is an interesting idea, the weapon might as well be a direct upgrade to the stock melee in its current form. The 10% slower firing speed is unnoticeable in almost every scenario while the ability to see enemy health and UberCharge is useful in various scenarios, allowing the user see the enemy teams health and Medics UberCharge percentage and therefore knowing when it is best to push in and attack. Due to the massive utility of this at the cost of basically nothing, the weapon will likely remain banned in its current state. Goal: Let enemies get the same effect that the user gets on them and add another passive penalty to make up for how the user can constantly see all of the enemies health when the enemies can only see the user and heal targets health. Changes: -Added downside: Enemies can see user and patients health and UberCharge -Removed 10% slower firing speed penalty -Added downside: -10 max health on wearer **Sydney Sleeper** This is the last weapon that I see as very problematic. The weapon appears to be balanced around removing the skilled aspect of Sniper, being headshots, and rewarding the user with upsides for less skilled play, something that I very much disagree with. Although the buff to the weapon in the Meet Your Match update that made headshots or fully charged shots cause an explosion of Jarate seemed to emphasize more skilled use of the weapon, it ultimately just buffed an already powerful and potentially game breaking weapon. To be specific, the ability to spam out Jarate practically infinitely from a long range at ease is overpowered on top of a faster charge rate on shots. I think that the weapon can be balanced around not being able to deal headshots as a downside, but the weapon will require serious changes. Goal: Keep the no headshots penalty but change the Jarate shots aspect of the weapon to require more skill to achieve and utilize in combat. Changes: -Changed On Scoped Hit: Jarate target for 2 to 8 seconds based on amount charged upside to Gain a Jarate shot that coats enemies in Jarate for 8 seconds through damage done (takes 500 damage) -Added upside: Press Reload to apply and / or remove Jarate to / from the following shot -Updated Headshots or fully charged shots cause an explosion of Jarate upside to Headshots or fully charged shots on Jarate shots cause an explosion of Jarate -Added downside: Spawning and resupply do not affect the Jarate shot meter **Jarate** Although the Mad Milk cannot really work in allowing teammates to get bonuses from its effects, the Jarate can due to Sniper being a lot more vulnerable than a Scout at close to medium range. However, like the Sydney Sleeper, the Jarate has the problem of being capable of being spammed out constantly near a spawn room. On top of this, the weapon just grants free mini-crits for the user to use at will that takes time instead of skill to obtain. Jarate also does not carry any real downside. Due to this, the weapon has recently been banned in Competitive. Goal: Change the weapon so that it cannot be spammed out near spawns and requires more skill to use. Changes: -Added downside: Jarate meter starts empty -Added downside: Spawning and resupply do not affect the Jarate meter -Added upside: Jarate meter builds with damage done and / or time (500 damage ; 60 seconds)"
366,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[IG] Heavy Changes,2,7nt57k,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/7nt57k/ig_heavy_changes/,2018-01-03 18:33:54,"The heavy update is probably the next major update, so I thought it'd be fun to make a post of what I'd like to see for it in terms of balance changes. **Class Global Changes** ~~**Heavy now has a lunchbox slot, the sandvich is the default item for it**~~ Tons of people have suggested a lunchbox slot over the years, I'm sure I don't have to explain what it is. While it's technically a buff, it doesn't really make Heavy that much more powerful. People take food over a gun because healing is great, and shotguns aren't really that great for Heavy when he already has a hitscan primary. ~~Spin up time increased, spin down time decreased~~ Heavy shouldn't be able to win fights very easily unless he's already spun-up, because that's the entire point of the class. With this, doing that with anything other than the Tomislav becomes basically impossible against a competent player. This also applies to the Tomislav, of course, but it will have a lower spin-up than everything else. This also buffs the shotgun (which every Heavy will now have) so it has an actual use aside from being a fat scout. To compensate, spin-down time is decreased. There's no reason why a Heavy should have to spend as long spinning down to switch to his sandvich after getting out of a fight. **Huo-Long Heater** old stats: ~~**Creates a ring of flames while spun up**~~ ~~**25% damage bonus vs burning players**~~ ~~*-10% damage penalty*~~ ~~*Consumes an additional 4 ammo per second while spun up*~~ new stats: ~~**Creates a ring of flames while spun up**~~ ~~**Sets enemies on fire for up to 7 seconds depending on distance**~~ ~~*-10% damage penalty*~~ ~~*Consumes an additional 3 ammo per second while spun up*~~ The current version has no real reason to use it, the ring of fire does jack shit, and the bonus on flaming enemies is only useful if you have friendly pyros, not to mention how little of a bonus it is, since the damage penalty still applies with it. Now that it sets enemies on fire from a distance, it's useful against Snipers from the fire knockback, great for preventing Spies from getting away if you see them backstab someone else, and helps get some extra damage for people that run away from you. (or if you die) Also slightly lowered the ammo consumption. **Brass Beast** old stats: ~~**+20% damage bonus**~~ ~~**-20% damage resistance when below 50% health and spun up**~~ ~~*50% slower spin up time*~~ ~~*-60% slower move speed while deployed*~~ new stats: ~~**+25% damage bonus**~~ ~~*25% damage vulnerability while fully spun-up*~~ ~~*-30% slower move speed while fully spun-up*~~ The current design is boring to play and underpowered. This completely changes the design of this weapon. Instead of becoming an immobile tank/sentry, you now do more damage and take more damage. The move speed penalty stays, but was toned way down. This should be much more fun to play with. **Natascha** old stats: ~~**On Hit: 100% chance to slow target**~~ ~~**-20% damage resistance when below 50% health and spun up**~~ ~~*-25% damage penalty*~~ ~~*30% slower spin up time*~~ new stats: ~~**No movement speed penalty while spun-up**~~ ~~*-20% damage penalty*~~ ~~*-25% ammo reserve*~~ ~~Hidden: Movement speed penalty while in the process of spinning up, as normal, but you return to full speed when it's done.~~ Slow-down mechanics are incredibly unfun to play against. This new design keeps the same general idea as the old gun, but now instead of ruining others' fun, you add to your own fun. :) **Tomislav** ~~*-10% damage penalty*~~ On top of the current stats. The current Tomislav is a little too good. The difference in damage is barely noticeable, for the benefit of a quick spin-up. This makes the difference in damage a little more noticeable, so stock is more than just ""somewhat better in certain situations maybe."" **Buffalo Steak Sandvich** ~~**Removed damage vulnerability**~~ ~~**Takes 50% less time to eat**~~ ~~**Heals 50 HP on consumption**~~ This weapon is a fucking mess. The speed boost isn't useful for rolling out because of how long it takes to eat, it takes away your ability to heal, etc. Hopefully this makes it more useful. **Dalokohs Bar** ~~Changed recharge time to 30 seconds, effect lasts 40 seconds, dropped version is now a medium health pack.~~ The current version isn't good for healing yourself OR healing teammates. Its only real use is the extra 50 health, but in most situations, it's not very helpful. With a medic, overheal is already going to make it pointless. Without a medic, the extra 50 health doesn't do a whole lot because it doesn't get healed. It's only really use currently is when combined with the Fists of Steel and/or a Quick Fix medic, because overheal can't go past 450, but the extra 50 health makes your overheal higher with those two. With this change, you can still use it for just yourself to keep your 50 max hp, which now lasts longer, but you can also heal your teammates with it. (I'm not super sure about this change) **this is the end of the post** ~~**im done**~~"
367,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[IG] Weapon Rebalance Ideas (V 1.5) [Long],1,7nzqfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/7nzqfv/ig_weapon_rebalance_ideas_v_15_long/,2018-01-04 13:09:38,"[Click Here for the Most Recent Version and Changes in Between Versions](URL The Most Recent Reddit Post (V 1.4) This is a work in progress Disclaimer: These are not official changes. These are simply my ideas, and yes, they are probably very broken and make weapons far too powerful. I am only throwing these ideas out there. I am open to ideas and constructive criticism. In fact, the main purpose of this is to have some creative solutions to balancing. Also, please give feedback on specific ideas, not vague general feedback. Note: I am not an expert on balancing, as you can probably tell. I also didnt include weapons just because they are banned in competitive, because I dont know enough about the bans to understand how to fix the weapon. Also sorry for any grammatical/spelling errors. English is my first language. **Weapon Rebalances and Changes** **General** &gt; Random Critical Hits Just remove random crits. However, the major upside to using a melee weapon is a higher crit chance. In order to help melee weapons, all melee weapons that normally get random crits will be able to combo, similar to the gunslinger. The first consecutive hit will be normal, second hit will mini-crit and the third will crit. Also, you should not be required to hold down attack, so you can have a short delay before attacking, to reward accuracy. &gt; Random Weapon Spread Two Options 1. Completely Remove it. (Makes it fairer) 2. Semi-Remove (Random weapon spread becomes deviation from the bullets path that it would take without random weapon spread.) This keeps it pseudo random. Not sure why you would really want this over no random weapon spread though. **Scout** &gt; Baby Faces Blaster Its fun to go fast, but the harsh penalties on the boost mechanic makes it frustrating to use. These changes still have the penalties, but make them less harsh. * Change the loss of boost on damage from 4% per point of damage to 1% per point of damage. * When boost is lost, have the boost meter go down rapidly instead of instantly going down. If the scout deals damage deals damage during this time, it stops draining. * Add: Boost drains over time (4% a second) &gt; Shortstop The shortstop is kind of weak. You simply dont have the same damage per shot or the increased damage ramp up. In addition, the shove is kind of useless. These changes are meant to make the shove more reliable, while provide a niche for the shortstop. * Shove should have a larger range, less wind up and the ability to cancel a reload with a shove (Which is a quality of life improvement when auto-reload is on). It should also be stronger, similar to a airblast with half-strength (Including weaker versions of the changes made in Jungle Inferno) * Add: Enemies pushed into the air by shove can be mini-crit by teammates while airborne. (The scout can not mini-crit his own victims) * Add: -10% air control when knocked in the air by knockback * Increase cooldown between shoves. &gt; Back Scatter The back scatter is pretty balanced, but the advantage is a very specific scenario and not significant enough to make a large difference. These changes are meant to make it to encourage flanking and more reliable while rewarding accuracy. * Add: Bullets go in a fixed spread pattern * Add: +15% Damage Bonus * Add: -33% Firing Speed (Makes it slower) * Add: -15% Reload Speed * Add: +100% Damage Falloff * Add: -50% Max Ammo * Remove: -20% Accuracy penalty &gt; Soda Popper This weapon is overpowered in 6s as it gives the scout 5 jumps to easily dodge rockets and grenades. This change forces the scout to careful when using the soda popper to dodge. The extra time for the hype mode is to give the scout time to think about when and how he uses the jumps. * Add: Mid-air jumps after the double jump reduce the scouts max health by 10 health. Lowest health possible due to this is 25 (15 with sandman) Max Health regenerates at 5 health/second. * Change: Hype Mode lasts for 12 seconds (From 8 seconds) &gt; Pretty Boys Pocket Pistol This pistol is practically a straight upgrade. However, the current design is much better than before. So instead of nerfing it into the ground, nerfing another aspect of the weapon to make of more a trade off and to fill a certain niche. * Add: -33% Damage Penalty * Add: -25% Max Ammo * Change: +25% Firing Speed (Up from 15%) &gt; Flying Guillotine The Guillotine is not very lethal. It can potentially deal 90 damage, but enemies will usually retreat to get health before that, making it weak in pubs but overpower in 6s. It no longer has the cleaver combo with the sandman. The aim of this buff is to give it a new role: To engage or disengage enemies. * Add: Hits give a 1 second speed boost * Change: 10 second recharge time (From 6 second recharge time) &gt; Scout Melee (General) Bats launch things. Like bodies. * Add: +300% Ragdoll Velocity &gt; Sun-on-a-stick The Sun-on-a-stick is not very effective. It deals pitiful damage, and even with crit swings its rather weak for all the trouble you need to go to. The damage resistance is also not very helpful since you need it out. These changes allow you to be more effecting against burning enemies, and allow it to chain * Add: No random Crits. * Add: Critical Hits ignite nearby enemies * Add: +20% Swing Speed Penalty * Remove: +25% damage resistance from fire while this weapon is active. &gt; Fan O War This weapon is useless outside of MvM. For the benefit of getting mini-crits, you might as well shoot the enemy twice instead of risking getting close. These changes will help the scout to have a team supporting role with this weapon. * Add: +50% Switch to and switch from Speeds * Add: 1 Second speed boost up on successful hit (To aid with getting away) * Add: Creates an outline around the victim that can be seen through walls for 5 seconds (One at a time) * Change: Teammates can mini-crit the victim (Scout is unable to mini-crit his own victims with this) * Remove: Crits whenever it would normally mini-crit. &gt; Wrap Assassin This weapon deals very poor damage. The bauble deals pitiful damage, and bleed can be easily canceled with heal packs. The baubles cant be picked up again. There isnt much reason to use this weapon. These changes are designed to make this weapon more viable by dealing more damage. * Add: Can hold up to 3 baubles at a time * Add: Crits bleeding enemies. * Add: Shatter effect causes bleeding as well * Change: +40% recharge speed (Up from +25%) **Soldier** &gt; Liberty Launcher This weapon has a lot of interesting upsides, but none that really complement each other well. I think that the liberty launcher could be an effective combo weapon, especially given its item set. These changes reflect that. * Add: +25% Knockback while rocket jumping (Enemies receive more knockback) * Add: All attacks while rocket jumping are mini-crits (Even your shotgun or melee) * Add: Mini-Crits have damage fall-off * Add: 15% Damage Vulnerability while rocket jumping (Doesnt include your rocket jumps) * Add: +33% faster switch from and switch to speeds &gt; Buff Banner The buff banner is balanced, though there isnt much reason to use it over the banners unless you are team player, since it there is no passive benefit. This change adds a simple passive buff to give it more use. * Add: +10% damage against overheal (Allows you to get rid of enemies overheal buff more easily) &gt; Reserve Shooter After Jungle Inferno, this weapon was nerfed into the ground. And for good reason. But now, its pretty useless. Usually when someone is in a situation that you can mini-crit them, they are too far away. This change is supposed make it more viable and make it more skill based. * Add: +30% Accuracy * Add: -10% Damage Penalty * Add: -25% Reload Speed (Makes it slower) * Change: Cannot Mini-Crit Blast Jumping Players (Knocking players in the air will still mini crit though) &gt; Righteous Bison This weapon was thankfully reverted (Mostly). However, it is still weak, even if valve ups the firing speed to compensate for the small hitbox to make damage comparable to the same as pre-MYM levels (As pointed out by Soundsmith) After that would be fixed, just buff the damage. * Increase the firing speed to hits the same number of the times as pre-MYM * Add: +15% Damage &gt; Escape Plan The escape plan is really good. However, the main downside is supposed to be that it cant a viable weapon and should be only used to escape. However, the speed bonus can allow you to dodge during melee combat. This change prevents it from being used in melee combat. * Add: -50% Damage Penalty * Add: -20% Swing Speed Penalty &gt; Equalizer This weapon pales in comparison to the escape plan. The utility of the escape plan overshadows being better at combat. This change is to make it better at combat at low health to make it an effective option. * Add: Swing speed increases as health is lowered, up to twice the normal swing speed. &gt; Disciplinary Action This weapon has a much longer range than normal. This makes it really good for melee combat. I have to solutions: Simply keep it the way it is, but just list the longer range, or have the weapon use two separate ranges, one for hitting teammates, and one for hitting enemies. Also, it can get teammates to the frontlines quickly with no huge downside, which is broken in 6s. Option 1 * Change: Gives a mini-speed boost instead which increases the speed by half the amount the normal speed buff does (Its based on what class is getting the buff) Option 2 * Add: Everytime you switch to this weapon or hit a teammate with it, it reduces your max health by 10 health. Max Health is restored and 5 health/second after the whip is holstered * Add: 15% slower holster speed **Pyro** &gt; Manmelter This weapon is a weak secondary as the only way to get crits if the enemy team has a pyro. This makes it hard to be viable as it is extremely situational. I have two options to help remedy this. Design 1 makes it a more reliable damage dealer, while design 2 makes it into a more support focused with the ability to not use crits. Design 1 * Add: Can penetrate enemies * Add: +33% Damage * Add: After Penetrating enemies it deals mini-crits Design 2 * Add: Can penetrate enemies and teammates * Change: Primary Fire no longer uses crits automatically * Change: Alt-Fire: Fires with using crits (If they are stored) * Change: Projectile can extinguish teammates * Change: Anytime you extinguish a teammate, you get crits Design 3 * Add: Weapon instantly reloads on successful hit * Add: Can penetrate enemies &gt; Thermal Thruster Its fun to be used, but it cant easily be used for bombing and it can be sluggish to use for mobility. Maybe this is to keep the detonator viable, but I dont think that should hurt this weapon. One option is to allow you to press a button, such as reload, and you can use it with any weapon equipped. I dont like that idea, as it has a custom taunt already. My idea should have a compromise. * Change: 0.7 Weapon holster time (Down from 1.1 seconds) &gt; Gas Passer This weapon has an interesting effect, but its long recharge time and lack of a secondary weapon hurt the weapons viability. The fact that charge isnt lost on death isnt exactly helping. Here are my thoughts on improving this weapon. * Add: Gas effect cannot to be removed or shortened in duration except by water * Add: Afterburn caused by the Gas effect can not be extinguished or shortened in duration except by water. * Remove: Gas meter isnt lost on death * Change: Half the required damage/time until a full recharge &gt; Axtinguisher A moment of silence for the Axtinguisher. It was nerfed for making the pyro too good at close range despite being a class designed to be close range? Anyway, these changes allow it to deal some serious damage while taking risks to use it. * Change: -50% Damage penalty against non-burning players (From 33% Damage Penalty) * Change: +15% Switch to speed bonus (From -75% Switch speed penalty) * Add: +85% Slower Holster Time * Add: Attacks Extinguish enemy players (Gets on crit and youre done) * Add: 20% Damage Vulnerability while Deployed &gt; Sharpened Volcano Fragment This weapon is worthless. Its so worthless, its hard to think of balance ideas. Here are several different ideas with a slight commentary. Option 1 * Add: On hit: Ignite and knock nearby enemies vertically into the air * Add: On Miss: Hit yourself. Idiot * Change: -33% Damage Penalty (From -20%) * Remove: Ignites players on hit This allows you to ignite several players and knock them back as well as being helpful for mobility. Option 2 (Stolen from Cosmic Afro) * Add: +33% Damage bonus on non-burning players * Change: -50% Damage Penalty on Burning players (From -20% Damage Penalty) This makes the sharpened volcano fragment into a burst damage ambush weapon Option 3 * Change: +20% Damage Bonus (From -20% Damage Penalty) * Add: Mini-crits Burning Players * Add: Player is ignited while deployed * Add: -50% Slower Holster Time * Add: No Random Crits This reverses the weapon completely. It becomes excellent at melee combat while making the player take damage over time and vulnerable to enemy pyros weapons. Option 4 * Add: While active: * Add: +75 health on kill * Add: 50% of all afterburn is returned as health * Add: +30% damage vulnerability on wearer Makes it into a healing melee, which was a niche the old power jack had. &gt; Third Degree This weapon is literally a straight upgrade to stock. Not a very helpful one though. These changes make this weapon into an effective medic killer while differentiating itself from stock. * Add: Crits enemies in a medic chain * Add: 20% Slower Swing Speed * Add: 20% Damage Vulnerability * Add: 20% Slower Holster Time &gt; Hot Hand This weapon is a meme weapon, so its understandable bad. However, due to its weak nature and fun with slapping (Especially since it swings twice), here is a buff to make the weapon a bit better while keeping it a meme. * Add: +10% Faster Swing Speed * Change: -20% Damage (It is actually -15% despite the description saying -20%) **Demoman** &gt; Loch-n-Load This weapons only use is as a crutch. The only upside besides easy to hit shots is a useless damage bonus against buildings. The stickybomb launcher is already amazing against buildings. These changes are meant to make it reward accuracy while not being too much of a crutch * Add: Mini-Crits while Blast Jumping * Add: Mini-Crits on enemies sent airborne by an explosion, grapple hook, or enemy attack. (Like the direct hit, includes air blast) * Add: Crits enemies sent airborne by an explosion, grapple hook, or enemy attack while blast jumping * Change: -50% Clip Size (From -25% Clip Size) * Change: -50% Blast Radius on non-critical and non-mini-crit attacks (From -25% Blast Radius) * Remove: +20% Damage Bonus Against Buildings * Add: -20% Slower Reload Speed &gt; Wee Booties and Bootleggers These weapons are pretty good on demoknight, but the +25 Health seems to small of a reason to give up the Grenade Launcher as when using stickybombs. This change is to encourage their use more. * Add: +200% Air Control &gt; Scottish Resistance This weapon is easily outclassed by the sticky bomb launcher because of the longer arm time. It cant simply be used in an offensive style. Because of this I have two designs: One that strengthen it defensively and increase the number of traps that can be made, and that weakens the defensive capabilities and reduces the penalties Option 1 * Add: 15% Damage Bonus * Change: +8 Max Pipe bombs (From +6) Option 2 * Change: +4 Max Pipe Bombs (From +6) * Change: +10% Firing speed (From +25%) * Change: 0.6 second Slower Arm Time (From 0.8 second slower arm time) &gt; Quickiebomb Launcher This weapon is pretty balanced. However, there is a damage penalty which makes sense? You want to prevent spamming, right? But since damage increases with charge, it counteracts at makes it deal damage. It isnt as effective as an anti-spam downside as it should be. The clip size penalty is already massive enough of a downside, so removing this mechanic should keep it balanced. * Remove: Up to +35% damage based on charge * Remove: -15% damage penalty &gt; Ullapool Caber Poor Ullapool Caber. It is basically useless. Its even slower to kill light classes than stock. The solution? Make it re-usable with a timer, similar to the new razorback and give it a way to be devastating while making it actually take skill. Also copy a beloved weapon. * Add: Crits while blast jumping * Add: Recharges after 30 seconds * Add: Crit Kills reduce recharge time by 33% * Add: 75% Slower Deploy Time * Remove: 100% Slower Deploy Time **Heavy** &gt; Natascha The slowdown makes this a pretty good anti-scout weapon but the weaker damage and slower spin up time penalties are quite significant. The damage resistance was nerfed in MYM, I guess as an attempt to allow snipers to one-shot overhealed heavies, even though the resistance affects attacks that drop below the threshold. These changes buff the resistance without affecting critical hits. (Critical damage is always Base Damage (Whatever type) + 2 x Critical Damage). Its also powerful in 6s while defending the last point and sitting in spawn. * Change: 20% resistance to non-critical damage while spun up (From 20% damage resistance when spun up and health is less than 50% of max) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability * Add: 20% Slower Speed while spun up &gt; Brass Beast The same changes as above, but with a slight increase in speed while spun up. * Change: 45% slower speed while spun up (From 60%) * Change: 20% resistance to non-critical damage while spun up (From 20% damage resistance when spun up and health is less than 50% of max) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability &gt; Buffalo Steak Sandwich This weapons speed boost is literally broken. It doesnt stack with the GRU, and it can be used to get the heavy to mid quicker with no disadvantage, which is broken in 5cp. However when used for its intended purpose, its quite weak. I have two fixes (And a combination of these two options) for the speed specifically, and stats to buff it. (Assuming Valve fixes the bugs with the speed boost interacting with the speed boost from the disciplinary action and the GRUs speed bonus) Speed Fix (Use one or a mixture both) Option 1: * Change: +25% Speed Bonus (From +35% Speed bonus) * Add: -50% speed penalty when the duration runs out and no kill was secured during the duration of the weapons use Option 2: * Add: Receive Speed boost for 3 seconds on kill * Remove: +35% Speed Bonus Option 3: * Add: Receive Speed boost for 3 seconds on kill * Change: +25% Speed Bonus (From +35% Speed bonus) * Add: -50% speed penalty when the duration runs out and no kill was secured during the duration of the weapons use Buffs (Regardless of Speed Fix) During the duration of the buff * Add: +5 seconds to the duration per kill * Change: 20% non-critical Damage Resistance (From 20% Damage Vulnerability) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability * Add: Unable to capture intelligence or capture points/payload * Add: -75% Healing from Healers (Like the Backscratcher) * Add: +300% Ragdoll Velocity on Kills These changes are made to make the heavy stronger while under the duration of the buff. You are already limited to melee weapons so having a damage vulnerability to all damage while only being able to deal melee damage made you a sitting duck. The critical damage vulnerability, removal of the ability to capture objectives and reduced healing from Medics and Dispensers remove the possibility of using the steak as a tool to tank damage. The added duration upon kill allows the heavy to continue the rampage. &gt; Warriors Spirit This weapon is pretty bad. Its hard to justify dealing more damage while taking more damage if you can only deal melee damage where as you can be attacked from any range. The health on kill is rarely a factor as well. * Add: Health on kill can overheal * Change: 20% Damage Vulnerability (From 30% Damage Vulnerability) * Add: 50% melee crit immunity while active **Engineer** &gt; Pomson 6000 The Pomson is bad. Its a pretty bad weapon with an unfair ability to drain bercharge and spy cloak. Its not fun to use or fun to fight. Here is an idea for a rework that doesnt have annoying mechanics and makes it more reliable. Option 1 * Add: Projectiles penetrate enemies * Add: On Hit: Ignite Enemy * Change: Increase Projectile speed to 1600 Hu/s (60 Hu/s faster than Liberty Launcher) (From 1200 Hu/s) * Remove: On Hit: Victim loses up to 10% Medigun charge. * Remove On Hit: Victim loses up to 20% cloak. Option 2 * Add: Projectiles penetrate enemies * Add: On Hit: All active buildings regen 10 health * Change: Increase Projectile speed to 1600 Hu/s (60 Hu/s faster than Liberty Launcher) (From 1200 Hu/s) * Remove: On Hit: Victim loses up to 10% Medigun charge. * Remove On Hit: Victim loses up to 20% cloak. &gt; Rescue Ranger This weapon is really good. A little too good. It allows you to heal at a range, and even at a lower amount of metal then what you would do with a wrench. It also allows you to pick up buildings from afar. I dont think it should be cheaper to heal a building with this weapon than with a wrench when you can do it from a range, though to be fair, a wrench can heal more. I had 3 ideas for changing the Health to Metal Ratio: 1. Make it the same as the wrench 3:1, still quite a good deal (20 metal per bolt) 2. Make it significantly worse, 2:1 I think still fair, but might be a bit too much for some (30 metal per bolt) or 3. Something done the middle, with a ratio that uses a nice, even amount of metal: 2.4:1 (25 metal per bolt) * Change: 2.4:1 Health to metal ratio (25 metal per bolt) (From 4:1 (15 metal per bolt)) &gt; Wrangler This weapon is really good because of its shield. It can stop 66% of the incoming damage, bringing the effective health of the sentry up to 648. These nerfs are designed to weaken the defensive capabilities of this weapon. Option 1 * Change: Shield stops 25% of incoming damage Option 2 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage, but the damage only blocks damage from the front of the gun Option 3 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage, but damage blocked drains your metal at a ratio of 1:1 Option 4 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage but drains a meter that when empty, the shield doesnt activate until it is full again. The shield can absorb up to 250 damage before empty and it recharges at a rate of 16.6 points of damage a second while the shield is not active. (Takes 15 seconds to fully recharge) &gt; Short Circuit This weapon is quite balanced, but there are two problems. Primary fire is basically useless as it has toothpick range and secondary fire can be used a lot, especially with metal being restored with a dispenser. * Change: Alt-fire uses 20 metal per shot, plus 5 per projectile destroyed (From 10 per shot) * Change: Holding down primary fire creates a small arc of electricity that can connect from enemy to enemy (Think a chainsaw made of electricity that can link between enemies) &gt; Southern Hospitality This wrench isnt bad. Its just kind of boring. Its bleed on hit makes it sound like its good for spies, but the cloak shortens the duration of status effects. Also its risky to go into melee range of a spy. However, the fire vulnerability rarely is a factor. These changes are designed make it an effective counter for spy, but only for proactive engineers or teams with effective coordination. Option 1 * Add: Applies an outline to the target on hit that can be seen through walls for 5 seconds (Shows even if cloaked) * Remove: 20% fire vulnerability * Add: Buildings have a 25% sapper vulnerability (Sappers deal 25% more damage and buildings are destroyed 25% faster from sappers) Option 2 * Add: Marked for death while building being sapped &amp; for short time after * Add: +100% damage to buildings (sappers) * Add: This weapon deploys 50% slower * Remove: 20% fire vulnerability **Medic** &gt; Syringe Guns General Syringe Guns are bad. Sure, medic isnt meant for combat, but sometimes you need to be able to defend yourself. Its hard defend yourself with against even a spy, and the crossbow its just so good. Here are two suggestions to help make needle guns in general able to compete with the crossbow. * Change: Instead of having a clip and an ammo pool, replace the clip with pressure meter. Taking a shot removes ammo and reduces the pressure meter. Reloading refills the entire pressure meter. The pressure meter has enough to shoot 40 needles. So what would this change? Well the idea behind this is to make it so that you can automatically reload the needle gun when it is not active. This makes switching between healing and shooting easier. Alternatively just have it passively reload, but that it is kind of weird as all passively reloading weapons have only 1 shot per clip. * Change: Projectile speed 1450 Hu/s (From 1000 Hu/s) About the same as the loose cannon. This makes the weapon more reliable. Even though the needle guns DPS is about 120 point blank, most shots will not hit. This makes it easier to defend yourself. &gt; Overdose This weapon is bad. You need to stop healing to make use of the speed boost so this makes it only good for running away with full Uber. Plus, you can heal a scout to fast. These changes make it helpful in more situations and to encourage medic to use it to go from patient to patient quicker and more often * Add: Overdose is displayed on the hip while hosltered * Change: +10% Movement Speed (From Up to +20% based on bercharge while active) * Add: 20% Faster Overheal Decay &gt; Quick-Fix This weapon is overpowered in 6s. The healing rate is too much that the current disadvantages cant compete. Option 1 * Add: 30% Faster Overheal Decay * Remove: +10% bercharge Rate Option 2 * Add: 60% Faster Overheal Decay * Change: 70% max overheal (up from 50%) * Remove: +10% bercharge Rate &gt; Vaccinator This weapon is also overpowered in 6s, as it is very common to be fighting only one damage type at a time. These changes weaken the bercharge and buff the weapon to compensate for it. Option 1 * Change: bercharge no longer protects both medic and the target. The resistances is applied to healing target by default, only applying to the medic if they are not healing or the target already has the resistance for that type. * Remove: -33% bercharge rate on Overhealed patients. * Change: If bercharge is activated on the medic, the resistances do not disappear if you switch weapons, but the duration is shortened by -33% Option 2 * Change: bercharge only provides a 50% damage resistance on the medic who is activating the bercharge. &gt; Amputator This weapon pales in comparison to the bersaw or Vitasaw. And ever since the change the way regen works, it cant save you from afterburn. The medicating melody isnt very effective for healing as you need to keep pressing Alt-Fire (Or Taunt). These changes allow for the amputator and effective mass healing weapon with the cost of being more vulnerable * Change: +5 Healing per Second while deployed (Flat Rate) (Up from +3 Healing per second) * Change: Medicating Melody Range: 512 units (Up From 450 units) * Change: Medicating Melody loops, with a brief delay before the healing begins and before control is restored to player * Add: 15% Damage Vulnerability while active Option 2 * Remove: While active: * Add: +50% faster regen recovery rate (rate at which max regen comes back is twice as fast) * Change: -50% damage penalty (down from -20%) &gt; Solemn Vow This weapon isnt that great. You need to relay the information to your team, which does make sense, but the upside it too small outside of 6s. These changes allow it to help teammates in a radius while putting yourself at risk * Change: Allows you and teammates within 512 units to see enemy health while it is deployed * Add: Enemies can see your health * Add: 10% Damage Vulnerability **Sniper** &gt; Sniper Rifles General (Does not include Huntsman or Classic) Sniper Rifles are really good. However, it can be frustrating to lose a 1v1 against a sniper, a class that is supposed to be weak in close combat. This can frustrate some people. This change is supposed to weaken the sniper in close combat, while it will still reward a skilled sniper in close combat. * Change: Sniper Rifles have damage ramp up, from 50% damage at point blank up to full damage after 512 units. &gt; Sydney Sleeper and Jarate This change is less to these weapons and more to the Jarate effect. This change is to make these weapons more balanced in comp, namely 6s * Change: The Jarate effects mini-crits have damage fall-off &gt; Hitmans Heatmaker This weapon isnt bad, just situational. The focus seems to be meant to for helping the user to be efficient and to have a plan to kill everyone you meet. However, its more helpful in sniper duels. This changes is to make the focus better for killing multiple targets * Remove: +25% faster charge rate with focus * Add: +25% faster reload Speed with focus. &gt; Classic This weapon is awful. It tries to emulate the sniper rifle from Team Fortress Classic, however, it just leaves this weapon as just bad. You can see more while charging, but that is small potatoes for not being able to headshot unless you are fully charged. This weapon needs a redesign. This redesign is a more mobile rifle that can be used to easily reposition at the cost of slower DPS. * Add: No Damage Ramp Up/ Damage Fall Off (See above) * Remove: Cannot headshot unless fully charged. * Add: Automatically charges at -66% Speed (Takes twice as long to charge) (No speed reduction here) * Change: Pressing primary fire shoots, pressing reload will go into a charging mode (What holding down normally does) Alt-Fire will go into charging mode and zoom in. * Add: Charge is not lost on unzoom or leaving charging mode (Though it is lost on weapon switch or shooting) * Add: Charging mode charges with -25% Speed (Compared to normal charge, not the auto charge) * Add: 50% Slower Reload * Change: -10% damage penalty (From -10% Damage penalty on body shot) &gt; Machina This weapon is popular for body shooting, because of 15% damage bonus. These changes are meant to help the piercing ability while rewarding accuracy. * Change: Shots penetrate players and damage players behind them (From Fully charged shots penetrate players and damage enemies behind them.) * Change: Shots that penetrate deal +30% More Damage (From Fully charged shots deal +15% damage.) * Add: Shots that penetrate deal damage in a radius &gt; Shahanshah This weapon is an interesting side grade. However, its benefit is only when you are in danger. This change is not change that, but to increase benefit when you are in that risky situation. * Change: +50% increase in damage when health is less than 50% of max. (From +25% increase in damage when health is less than 50% of max.) * Change: 50% decrease in damage when health is more than or equal to 50% of max. (From 25% decrease in damage when health is more than or equal to 50% of max.) **Spy** &gt; Disguise General Lets face it. Disguises hardly fool anyone, unless the spy is a master of deception. Below are two ideas to make disguises fit in more. However, I am skeptical of these ideas, as this will just make people always spy check as there are less ways to see if a player isnt a spy. * Add: Add key bindings to allow the spy to feign a shot with his disguises weapon. The shot would look just like the real thing and behave the same way (e.g. Explode animation would play, minigun would slowdown spy, scope would seem to move to the spys face), except it doesnt deal damage, knockback or any other effect. There would need to be a weapon for primary and alt-fire. However, the shot ignores any ammo restrictions, so if a careless spy isnt careful theyll be shooting 6 grenades from a grenade launcher. This is to make this new ability actually take some skill. * Add: If a teammates attack hits a disguised spy, the disguises health will appear to drain unless a shot is fatal. &gt; Enforcer This weapon is broken. The pierce doesnt even work half the time. The first options changes are to make this weapon have more similarities with older designs and turn this weapon into a close range revolver for a gun spy. The second options are a simpler, less range restricted version of the stats. Option 1 * Change: +25% Damage Bonus (From +20% Damage Bonus while disguised) * Change: -10% Slower Firing Speed (From -20% Slower firing speed) * Add: Cannotcloak while this weapon is deployed * Add: -50% Slower Holster Speed * Add: +25% Max Ramp-up (Like the scatter gun) * Add: -60% accuracy (Revolvers are already quite accurate, not sure how much this would change) * Add: +100% Damage Falloff * Remove: Attacks pierce and resist shield effects Option 2 * Change: +25% Damage Bonus (From +20% Damage Bonus while disguised) * Change: -10% Slower Firing Speed (From -20% Slower firing speed) * Add: Cannot cloak while this weapon is deployed * Add: -50% Slower Holster Speed * Remove: Attacks pierce and resist shield effects &gt; Ambassador This weapon was nerfed too reduce its range. Some people were not pleased with this. These changes mostly keep the changes intact, but make it a bit more forgiving * Change: Headshots deal full damage until 512 Hammer Units (From 447 Hammer Units) * Change: Headshots after 1200 Hammer Units deal critical damage (Though still only doing 51 Damage) &gt; Diamondback This weapon is really good. Its a spy weapon that rewards you for doing spy things. Also, people are upset this weapon wasnt nerfed when the ambassador was. These changes are supposed to reduce the effective range of this weapon and weaken it. These changes include the ambassador changes above Option 1 * Add: Crits have damage falloff. Option 2 * Add: Crits have damage falloff. * Add: -20% damage penalty while disguised (In addition to existing damage penalty) &gt; Red-Tape Recorder This weapon is pretty bad. Its far too slow to destroy stuff, just making it an annoyance. These changes are meant to make it easier to get away without an engineers teammates noticing you and to disable the buildings for longer after being removed, to make it more of a weapon that you use to prepare for a team push. * Add: Noise Created is 75% Quieter (I know this ) * Change: Disables sentry guns for 1.5 seconds after being removed (While it is not unbuilding after being downgrade) (From 0.5 seconds) * Add: If the Sapper is removed and the building is being folded up, after the sentry rebuilds to Level 1, there is a 1.0 second delay before the sentry can be upgraded or fire.

Here's my attempt to change it... **The Southern Hospitality** *Level 5 Wrench* ~~**On hit: 5 seconds of bleed**~~ ~~**+25% damage bonus**~~ ~~*30% fire damage vulnerability*~~ ~~*-10% swing speed*~~ I know it seems small but swing speed determines upgrade speed, repair rate, construction speed, and damage. ~~Hidden: Bleed bypasses spy cloak debuff for a full 5 seconds~~ It's worth mentioning the damage bonus is balanced by the engineer's low health so one can't just go demoknighting the enemy team. Also I thought it would be ironic if the ""Southern Hospitality"" did more damage. Edit: Added 30% fire vulnerability like the original"

371,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[OP/IG] Banned in Competitive (Post-JI version),6,7p4gsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/7p4gsz/opig_banned_in_competitive_postji_version/,2018-01-09 14:56:37,"So i did one of these before but I'm gonna remake it because it is outdated. Anyway, I'm gonna try and make banned weapons not as broken. The thing I'll do differently is examine why it's underused in pubs and try to create a good balance so it's not awful. **Reserve Shooter** *Why it's banned: Can do pretty good damage to airborne targets and switch faster with really no downside* *Why it's not used: The upsides aren't really that big* (+) Added +20% more accurate. (+) Added mini-crits while airborne and 1 second after landing. (-) Removed mini-crits on launched targets. (-) Added -25% firing speed. Now it's not for combos and instead for aerial assaults. It also would still have the clip reduction and increased switch but it will have a harsher downside. I'm not entirely sure if this will be good, but pyro already has a lot of crit combos and soldier doesn't really need any. **Soda Popper** *Why it's banned: Does similar dps to stock and the hype can shut down soldiers and demos.* *Why it's underused: Lacks freedom of firing and shutting explosive classes down isn't that important in pubs.* (+) Hype now grants double jump height and immunity to all knockback and movement imparing effects for 8 seconds. (+) Kills will instantly add +2 clip and caps at 4 clip (basically if you kill with one shot you get 3 clip but it will be lost on use). (-) Hype no longer grants more jumps. (-) Hype takes 550 damage to fill. (-) Reduced reload speed by 35%. (-) Reduced firing speed by 10%. There's quite a bit i changed so strap in. Firstly the jumps was changed to a jump height increase and immunity to knockback and movement imparing effects. This makes it good for mobility but not annoying to hit. It's also a bit better for pubs to counter airblast happy pyros, force a nature scouts, and things like that. You also have a little clip gimmick which means you can have 4 total clip if you can make use of your shots and keep killing. It gives you freedom of firing but you have to work for it. Also i adjusted firing and reload so it's not too op with the clip gimmick. Finally the hype takes more too fill which gives more focus on the clip thing. **Crit-a-Cola** *Why it's banned: Mini-crits on scout for such little effort is just a bad idea.* *Why it's underused: It isn't that underused but i think it's because you either don't want to be an ass or you don't like the marked for death* (+) Removed marked for death after firing a shot. (+) Added +10% speed while under the effects and melee is out. (+) Added +25% faster recharge rate. (-) Mini-crits only apply to melee weapons. Now it's a bit more of a gimmick but surely a fun one. You gain extra speed and mini-crits and can just go ham with your melee. It's not too overpowered because melees aren't that strong but it would still be fun. Also it recharges faster so you can keep the crits coming. It could also be useful in comp for a slightly faster rollout, though that's all it really adds. **Flying Guillotine** *Banned: Really high spammability with how fast it recharges* *Underused: You get an easily missable projectile, I'm not exactly sure why else* (+) Added +100% damage to debuffed players. (-) Reduced base damage to 40. (-) Increased recharge to 11 seconds. Now it's not as spammable normally so it's not as annoying on the close range class. I also revived the crit gimmick but it's nowhere near as powerful. It does 80 damage as opposed to 150. The plus is that it's more versatile. You can use the wrap assassin to get bleed, or pair with another class to get debuffs. **Mad Milk** *Ban Reason: Gives a really big debuff to one or multiple enemies that can really give your team an advantage* *Underused: Easily missable projectile which requires team play, not a big thing in pubs.* (+) Milked enemies will restore 125% of the health to the person who killed them (so it goes into overheal). (+) Increased recharge to 18 seconds. (-) No longer heals on hit. (=) Mvm Upgrade: Health restored on hit. Now it's not as big of a disadvantage and rewards killing rather than hitting. I also bumped the recharge down a bit to compensate for the nerf. Also i added a new mvm upgrade so it can still be good in mvm. **Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol** *Banned: Gives healing and more dps for pretty much no downside* *Underused: It isn't* (-) Added -50% holster speed. I think this would be a good way to make it more fair. You can get this health but putting it away is slow and it leaves you open to be attacked. Not too much else to say here. **Cow Mangler 5000** *Banned: Basically a straight upgrade in 6s where sentries are uncommon and only dealing mini-crits isn't that big* *Underused: I honestly have no idea why, maybe because sentries are more common in pubs?* (+) Added +50% projectile speed. (+) Decreased damage to buildings to -40%. (-) Added -10% speed while active. Now it has a bigger upside that actually fits (it's a laser so it should be fast). I also added a downside that actually matters but isn't too punishing. You can hit your shots but people can bit theirs better too. **Disciplinary Action** *Banned: Gets people out faster, mainly heavies, for little downside.* *Underused: Isn't* (+) Hitting teammates will give them a 20% damage resistance for 2 seconds. (+) Decreased damage penalty to 15%. (-) No longer gives teammates a speed boost. (-) Have a 25% damage vulnerability while active. Now it gives resistance rather than speed which is more useful in battle than for rollouts. Since you would use it in the heat of battle, the damage vulnerability is a bit more punishing to you. You have to be cautious using it, though it will still be useful. **Natascha** *Banned: Slowdown just isn't fun to fight* *Underused: Slowdown isn't as big in pubs and the damage penalty and spin up kills it* (+) Added +25% speed for 3 seconds on hit. (+) Decreased damage penalty to -20%. (-) Removed slowdown on hit. Now it's pretty much the exact opposite, instead of slow to enemies you have speed to you. The speed can be good to keep moving while spun and can use it to unrev and move a bit. **Buffalo Steak Sandvich** *Banned: Gives a free rollout and you can keep healing your medic without penalty* *Underused: Rollouts aren't that important in pubs and solo heavies are more common* (+) No longer have a damage vulnerability using it. (+) Effect lasts until you switch off weapons. (+) Can swap weapons but it will end the effects early. (-) Speed only applies once you deal or take any not self inflicted damage. (-) Effects give -50% holster speed to your melees. Now it's better for going melee rampage heavy rather than a good rollout weapon. You can help it up until you switch off which means infinite mini-crits. You can also switch off to end the effects and defend yourself. The thing is the speed only applies on taking or dealing damage, meaning people have to think before they shoot you. Also a holster speed so ending the effects takes a bit more. **Rescue Ranger** *Banned: Gives engineer a lot of defensive abilities even though he already can defend really good.* *Underused: Isn't* (-) Bolts have a reverse fall-off healing effect (35 at close and 60 at far). This more puts in the design of keeping your sentry alive from afar and not using it when you can use your wrench instead. The wrench is balanced by having to take damage if you are too close to your sentry, avoiding that so well is a bit much. **Wrangler** *Banned: Gives your sentry way too much protection which just makes it hard to destroy and slows the game by a lot* *Underused: Isn't* (-) Are marked for death while the weapon is active and 3 seconds after holstering. (-) Sentry is disabled for 6 seconds after death (still 3 after holster). Now there's a lot more risk to it. You go down easy but your sentry doesn't, making you have to be more careful. If you die, your sentry is likely going down too. **Short Circut** *Banned: Can destroy projectiles to shut down most of his counters and can outshoot the firing speed of most weapons* *Underused: Using metal for ammo i think? Maybe because it requires a bit of good timing and skill and pubbers suck at that? I'm not sure. (+) Added +5 health on hit. (+) Added +10 health on destruction. (-) Alt-fire firing speed reduced to .75 seconds. (-) Alt-fire costs 20 metal per attack (and 5 per projectile). Now it's a bit more supportive by getting health back on hit which basically converts metal to health. The problem is you have to hit your shots good. Also alt-fire is nerfed a bit so it's not as broken as before. **Quick-Fix** *Banned: Is bad at pushes but good at defending, making boring stalemates* *Underused: Isn't* *New Design:* (+) +30% heal rate. (+) Mimics blast jumps done by your patient. (-) -25% uber build rate. (-) -25% uber duration. (=) Ubercharge grants +250% heal rate, knockback immunity, and -75% time on debuffs. Now it's actually good for doing pushes since you can actually overheal. The downside now is slower uber build and less uber duration. It makes the weapon good for healing but not using ubers. Also your uber gives less heals but complete knockback immunity and less timer on debuffs. **Solemn Vow** *Banned: Can see enemy Ubercharge which is really valuable info for little downside.* *Underused: Isn't the ubersaw* (+) Seeing enemy health is passive and applies to your heal patient. (+) Removed firing speed penalty. (-) Enemies can see your health passively. (-) Can no longer see uber and vice versa. Now it's a bit better since you can get out info to your team better but has an actual downside. Enemies can see your health, so it kind of balances out. How good it is relies both on how you or your enemy uses it. **Sydney Sleeper** *Banned: Can one shot medics with a less risky bodyshot and do it faster while debuffing others* *Underused: No headshots* *New Design:* (+) Create a Jarate explosion on kill. (+) Press ""R"" to unjarate all enemies and gain 25 health per person. (-) -20% base damage. (-) -25% charge rate. Now it's a bit more simple. On kill you debuff others but getting that kill is harder. A quickscope will do only 120 damage which can't even one shot a light class, so you have to try a bit. Also you can gain health back after killing people. **Jarate** *Ban Reason: Same as mad milk* *Underused: Isn't really that underused* (-) Mini-crits changed to -25% damage vulnerability. It doesn't seem like that big of a change but let me explain myself. Jarate isn't as bad as the milk as sniper isn't in close battles as much. Despite that, it can still give an unfair advantage. Now vulnerability is a bit less and it has fall-off on the effects. It makes it a bit more fair while making it usuable. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ So that's it. I skipped a few but i have good reasons for it. I didn't do the atomizer because it's simply bugged. The mantreads and dragons fury are still banned for testing so they don't count. I honestly couldn't think of a good balance for the vaccinator, i might need help here. "
372,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[IG] Big List Of Balance (Part 1) Warning: Extremely Long,4,7e5igl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/7e5igl/ig_big_list_of_balance_part_1_warning_extremely/,2017-11-20 13:15:11,"So I've done a lot of balancing here, and i think it's time for a balance megathread. This will be quite long so sorry if you don't like to read through insufferably long posts. For this first one i will do multi-class balancing and the offense classes. I will also go back and edit this if i see good reason to change a balance idea. Here we go. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Panic Attack** (=) This weapon has been reverted to it's previous design. (+) Can now holster the weapon and store loaded shells. (-) Loaded shells automatically fire when deployed. As much as i doubt the tf2 will go back to the original design, it's currently a bit boring. The original design could be better if you could holster the shells. It would then be used for a really fast 4 shot pick with lack of good aiming or using more than once. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **B.A.S.E. Jumper** (+) Passively take 50% less falling damage. So the jumper is a useless gimmick that honestly wasn't that good before. Pulling out the parachute makes you a sitting duck now with no real purpose. This change makes it useful without having to slow your decent, but can still be used with the air strike. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Reserve Shooter** (+) Crits launched targets instead of mini-crits. (-) Crits do not apply to targets launched by you. (-) Added -20% damage penalty. Now it's a good aerial denial weapon rather than a combo one. It's pretty underused on soldier and it was op on pyro. This makes it just a counter to people trying to jump away. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Soda Popper** (+) Damage needed to fill hype decreased to 425. (-) Added -10% damage penalty. (-) Removed +25% faster reload speed. The problem with the soda popper isn't really the multiple jumps, it's that you do pretty much the same damage as stock. You should be able to be super jumpy because you earned it, this makes it just not as good as stock normally. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Shortstop** (+) Increased reload speed by 30%. (+) Removed knockback vulnerability. (-) Removed alt-fire shove. This makes it a simple weapon with no extra stats or any weird stuff. Just a good mid-range damage dealer with quick firing speed and 4 clip. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Baby Face's Blaster** (+) Boost no longer depletes on double jump. (+) Boost increases jump height to a max of 50%. Instead of punishing jumping, why not punish just taking damage? You lose boost on hit, so you have to be incredibly evasive so you don't lose boost. Punishing both double jumping and taking damage is a bit much. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Back Scatter** (+) Removed clip size penalty. (+) Removed accuracy penalty. (-) Now does -15% damage from the front. This gives it a downside that fits with the weapon and gives scout one weapon without a clip size reduction. The mini-crits from the back is a bit hard to get but this weapon overall rewards flanking but punishes being in the front. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Bonk! Atomic Punch** (+) Slowdown no longer scales with damage taken. (-) Slowdown increased to 35%. The weapon currently punishes you for getting damaged. The problem is that the point of the weapon is to block damage, so why would you punish someone for using the weapon as it's supposed to be used? This makes it more consistent and not punish you for the main point of the weapon. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Mad Milk** (+) Extinguishing players gives them afterburn immunity for 8 seconds. (-) Health gain reduced to 45% from 60%. The milk can be pretty powerful and give your team a good advantage against a group of players. This makes it not give as much of an advantage but makes it a decent pyro counter. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Winger** (+) Are immune to falling damage while active. (-) Removed damage increase. This stat on the old pocket pistol really didn't fit, but i think it fits a bit more here. I also removed the damage bonus because it really doesn't do much and is pretty useless. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol** (-) Added -50% damage penalty. Currently the design is a bit overpowered. You give up 3 clip for almost half health back in a clip. Now it does less damage, so it's more for getting health back and not having a good advantage. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Candy Cane** (+) Added +25% health from packs on wearer. Now it makes the pack you get much better and overall can make it useful when you need health. It makes the cane much better for self support. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Sun On A Stick** (+) Now removes all negative effects of an ally on hit. (+) Replaced fire resistance to -50% timer on negative effects. (-) Removed crits on burning enemies. (-) Added -50% switch speed. This makes it a better support tool and not just a gimmick that never comes into play. You can use it to hit an escape plan soldier or just to counter a good pyro. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Fan O'War** (+) Gain a +15% speed boost when someone is marked for death. This makes escaping after marking someone much easier, making it much less risky to run in, do 9 damage, and try and escape. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Wrap Assassin** (+) The bleed effect will block healing until it ends. This makes it good for doing damage and the person won't just have extra uber for their medic or go to a health pack real quick. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Black Box** (+) Health on hit is now +50 health on kill. (-) Blocks non weapon healing while active. So now it rewards finishing opponents off. The downside is that you can't be pocketed by a medic, making it a good roamer weapon rather than pocket. I don't agree that it's currently op, the 1 clip loss can make quite a difference. The health really isn't that much and i feel it's complained about more than it should. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Air Strike** (+) No longer reduces explosion radius when blast jumping. (-) Increased base explosion penalty to -30%. Now it doesn't penalize you when blast jumping but it makes it worse on the ground. Now it's slightly more punishing than it currently is in the air as well. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Buff Banner** (+) Now have a passive +15% firing speed. The thing that turns most people off from this weapon is that it has no passive upside like the other banners. I gave it a passive upside, so now people might actually use it. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Concheror** (-) Now takes 600 damage to fully fill the rage meter. So this weapon does pretty much everything better than the other two. It fills faster *and* has a better passive effect. This makes it on par with the other weapons but doesn't nerf the healing. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Equalizer** (+) Switch speed increases as health decreases (up to 75% faster switch speed). Now you can quickly pull it out at low health as well as do massive damage. It might not save the weapon, but it would be a pretty good improvement. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Escape Plan** (-) Added -100% holster speed. This makes it much more risky to pull out because it's going to take a year to put it away. This means you have to go quite far to confirm your safety. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Backburner** (+) Decreased airblast penalty to +100%. Now you get a bit more airblast, 1 more to be precise. The loss of defending yourself is a bit much, so 1 extra airblast couldn't hurt. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Phlogistinator** (+) Now charges through all types of damage. (+) Decreased damage needed to fill ""Mmph"" to 250. (+) Gain a 25% damage resistance when mmphed. (-) ""Mmph"" Will only grant mini-crits. This does a few things. It makes getting the mmph much easier and you can use a shotgun or melee to fill it up too. You also can tank a bit more damage when mmphing. The downside to all this is that you only do mini-crits, making it not as powerful when used. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Dragon's Fury** (-) Now will crit on burning enemies rather than 300% more damage. So now the damage is a lot more consistent and crit or mini-crit boosts won't change much. I don't think this needs a huge nerf, just a little rework. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Detonator** (+) Decreased self damage to +25% from 50%. Now you can jump a lot more and it isn't as risky to do so. Not the biggest change ever, but it means much more jumps. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Manmelter** (+) Alt-fire will now remove all negative effects. Now it's not as situational by including all negative effects, no enemy pyros needed. Not being able to crit on burning enemies is enough, so getting more crits is a good thing. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Thermal Thruster** (+) Removed increased holster time. The holster on this thing is incredibly long and it removes any cool divebomb tactics. Now that you can quickly put it away, it can be used to jump in and burn everyone. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Gas Passer** (+) Decreased recharge time to 45 seconds. (+) Now start with a full tank. I like the idea of this weapon, just not the execution of it. It just takes so long to reload, it really kills it for me. If the recharge time is increased and you can start with a full tank, it can be used much more. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Axetinguisher** (+) Damage penalty only applies to non-burning players. (+) Removed slower deploy speed. (-) Added -100% slower holster speed. Now it can do a bit more damage, making you able to one shot demos and pretty much kill soldiers. The downside is it's pretty risky to pull out due to how long it takes to put away. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Sharpened Volcano Fragment** (+) Marks enemies for death on hit (15 seconds, one at a time). (-) Increased damage penalty to -40%. Now you can use it to give a big advantage over someone at cost of good damage. Marking enemies for death can give pyro a really good support weapon. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Third Degree** (+) Gives a passive up to +4 health regen (like the conch). (-) Added -30% health from all sources (besides your own healing). Now it has a non-gimmick use! I see the idea of stealing overheal, but that's just as situational. This is a good weapon for roaming pyros that need some quick heals to stay in battle. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Neon Annihilator** (+) Now crits on gassed enemies. Simple change but it gives pyro a good combo with the gas passer. It will actually have a use outside of the 5 maps with water on them. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ It's over (for now). Stay 'tuned' for another one in probably several days. "
373,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[IG] Me Me Big List Of Balance (Part 2) Warning: Pretty Long,1,7fca0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/7fca0h/ig_me_me_big_list_of_balance_part_2_warning/,2017-11-25 13:25:58,"This again. If you haven't seen my other post just do, there's like 2 posts a day so it shouldn't be hard to find. Anyway in this i will do demoman, heavy, and engineer. Also if you don't like text walls, suck it up. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Loch'n'Load** (+) +20% damage to buildings changed to +20% damage. (+) Bombs will now explode when hitting a surface. (-) Removed increased projectile speed. (-) Explosion radius reduced to -40%. This gets rid of the projectile speed that everyone seems to hate in favor of overall damage and having your bombs instantly explode, meaning you can be less accurate. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Loose Cannon** (+) Increased base damage to 80 (-) Decreased explosion damage to 50. This makes it more useful when you aren't constantly double donking but doesn't increase the donk damage by as much. This makes it much more useful overall rather than a gimmicky weapon. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Ali Baba's Wee Booties** (+) Gives an up to +4 health regenerated on wearer. (-) Charge turning control decreased to 100%. The booties are currently a pretty much strictly demoknight weapon. That's fine and dandy but i think demo should be a bit more versatile in his weapons. Knight only weapons are fine but a stat that effects both classes would be more useful. The turning control won't even be that useful with a chage coming later. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Scottish Resistance** (+) Now deals 50% less damage for the first .8 seconds after arming. Now you can do damage with it before .8 seconds but it's nowhere near as good as the stock's damage before then. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Quickie Bomb Launcher** *New Design* (+) No arm time. (+) +10% damage increase. (-) -25% clip size. (-) -5 max stickies out. (-) Damage decreased by 10% for every second out. Now it amplifies what the original design was but still a bit more useful. You can have stickies out as long as you want but it loses it's damage. This could also be an upside because if you wait a second you will take less damage than stock. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **All Sheilds** (+) Now have a 200% increase in turning control. The problem with demoknight is that you are going in a predictable straight path. That's not the only issue but i think a bit of turning control could make it much better. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Tide Turner** (+) Mini-crits will now apply to your primary. (+) Resistances increased to 20%. (+) No longer lose charge when taking damage. (-) Melee kills will only refill 25% of your charge meter. (-) Sheild bash now does only 15 damage. Since the extra turning control on all sheilds would make this a bit less useful, i buffed it a bit. These changes make it a good hybrid knight weapon that relies less on his melee weapons. I may get backlash for 2 changes that make demoknight weapons good for the demoman, but I think versatility is good. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Ullapool Caber** (+) Now will mini-crit while airborne. (+) Has a 30 second recharge. Currently the caber is pretty underpowered and isn't even good to meme with. Now you can have a demoman market gardener, also it's not a one time thing. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Natascha** (+) Increased spin up time to +15%. (-) Removed damage resistance when spun up. I think the Natasha would be much better as a more support weapon designed to stop and flankers or people running away. Increased spin up makes that much easier to do. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Brass Beast** (+) Reduced speed penalty when spun up to -33%. (-) Removed damage resistance when spun up. Now you can actually move a bit but you aren't as tanky. The main thing killing it now is you pretty much can't move while spun up. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Huo-Long Heater** (+) Ammo drained per second from fire ring dropped to 3. (+) Pressing R while spun up will toggle between the fire ring being on and off. (+) Damage penalty only apples to non-burning targets. Now it's overall more useful. You don't drain ammo as fast and you can turn it off if you don't want the fire ring active. Also it will actually do +25% damage on burning enemies. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Dahlokos Bar** (+) +40% taunt speed. Now it's a lot more for a loner heavy who needs a quick heal. The second banana is currently better in pretty much every way, so this gives a bit more to set out from the others. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Buffalo Steak Sandvich** (+) Can now switch weapons when under the effects. (+) Eating it will give 50 health back. (-) Mini-crits only apply to melee. (-) Speed only kicks in as soon as you get hit (5 seconds, does not stack). Now you can actually defend yourself when fighting someone smart enough to just shoot you when outside your range. Also you can't use it for rollouts now but if you are being attacked you can have speed for 5 seconds after the effects end. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Gloves of Running Urgently** (+) Now regenerates 30 hp/s when holstered. It currently takes 20 seconds to get back to full health, that's a bit much. Now it only takes about 7 seconds, nowhere near as extreme. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Eviction Notice** (+) Removed health drain while active. (+) Speed on hit lasts for 8 seconds. (-) No longer gives a speed boost while active. Now it's not just a GRU lite and can give you an insane burst of speed if you hit someone. You just have to hit someone, that's the hard part. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Warriors Spirit** (+) Crits when it would normally mini-crit. Now it actually pairs well with the weapon that it's supposed to be paired with. You can do an incredible amount of damage with the steak but die pretty quick. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Pomson 6000** (+) Has an alt-fire that does 50% less damage but will cause your sentry to target the person hit for 10 seconds (regardless of range, but ignores them when out of sight.) (+) Projectile penetrates targets. (-) Removed uber and cloak drain. Now it can still be used as a spy counter by tracking an invisible or disguised spy and can be used to focus someone when a bonk scout is annoying you. It also can penetrate people, so that's cool. Also i removed the pretty much useless but ban worthy uber and cloak drain. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Wrangler** (-) 66% damage resistance on sappers placed while wrangled. Now if a spy comes along during your wrangler tunnel vision you are going to have a hard time talking it off. This especially applies for the jag which would take 9 hits to remove it. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Short Circut** (=) Uses a clip instead of ammo. (=) 20 shots in clip and alt-fire uses 4 clip per shot. (-) Has a 2 second reload. Now it doesn't use up your valuable metal and isn't as overall spammable. I'm not too sure if this is a buff or nerf, so it's a neutral attribute. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Southern Hospitality** (+) Sentry gun will now cause enemies to bleed on hit. (-) Fire vulnerability increased to 20% damage vulnerability. I honestly gave up and did this. I'm not sure if it's balanced or not but i was pretty tired at this point."

(Minicrits and crits knock enemies back even more). (+) +25% faster switch speed. (-) Cannot kill enemies (-) -50% knockback vulnerability. Maybe not overly viable, but still a neat gimmick that can be pretty fun if used right. Especially good if used on knight for the sheild bash for damage and then send them flying. "
377,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[IG] Finishing Off This Big List of Balance Lonk,1,7h6k4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/7h6k4m/ig_finishing_off_this_big_list_of_balance_lonk/,2017-12-03 11:45:49,"Blah Blah I'll just get to the point. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Syringe Gun** (+) Ramp-up increased to 150% (15 max damage per syringe from 12). (+) Reload speed decreased to 1.2 seconds. So now it's much more effective at dealing damage like it's supposed to be. It's probably still not going to be the best weapon, but it can help for when it is needed. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Crusaders Crossbow** (+) Increased healing to 90-180 health per shot. (-) Decreased damage to 30-60 per shot. (-) -1 health drained per second on wearer. Before i am crucified let me explain. The downside of the weapon is supposed to be that you have very little self defense, thus the health drain. Also the damage was dropped for the same reason but the healing was buffed so it emphasises team support. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Blutsauger** (+) Applies mad milk effect based on distance traveled (10 at close, 3 at far). (+) Syringes have very little arc. (-) -15 max health on wearer. So now it can be used a bit more effectively and heal you much quicker. You do up to 15 a shot so that's about 10 health per hit at max. You can also hit long range shots easier but the health penalty is a bit more severe. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Overdose** (=) Speed is now passive. (+) +15% speed at max uber. (-) -10% speed at low uber. Now it isn't just an active effect but you move much slower at full uber. You will be penalized at the start but as you build uber you get faster. You will also slowly lose speed during an uber. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Quick-Fix** (+) Uber now has +350% healing and makes crit heals unressetable (-) Decreased healing increase to +25%. (-) Uber build starts to slow at 120% health. The problem i have with the quick fix is that it does pretty much everything better than stock. It heals quick, builds uber quick, and you can jump high with a soldier or demo. The only downsides is the ubercharge not being invincible, but it still takes quite a bit of damage to take you out. You also can't overheal them as much but you don't need to if you have extra healing. Now it's plain and simple not as good. To compensate, the uber is a bit better. It now isn't as overpowered but still really useful. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Vaccinator** (+) Ubercharge now blocks 50% of all damage and gives immunity to negative effects (as well as the previous crit immunity). (+) Now give a 10% resistance rather than 10% of a selected type. (+) Overheal build penalty decreased to -33%. (-) Can no longer select resistances. (-) Decreased uber build to +33%. Ok this is probably what's going to get the most hate but let me explain this one. Ok so the vaccinator is not that useful to be honest with you. Stock is good for the ultimate push and all around reliability, the quick fix is good for getting in massive healing, the kritzkreig is good for clearing chokes and is godly in mvm, but the vaccinator? It can be used to counter hackers, but that's a bit of a rare and undermining thing to need. Also the whole switching resistances thing is kind of a hassle and is easily counterable. It's easy to counter a vaccinator uber by just going in with two different damage types. Also it's a constant pressure to keep switching resists and can lead to stress of needing to constantly change and makes it easy to forget about other things. Getting rid of the resistance types is pretty much needed to make it actually viable. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Ubersaw** (-) Uber on hit decreased to +20%. A seemingly minor change, but now it takes 1 extra hit to reach full charge. Now it's a bit harder to get full uber not not made to be useless. I honestly don't think the ubersaw is op, the others are just not as good as it, so it's only minor. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Amputator** (+) Use alt-fire to hold being in taunt until it is released. Now the taunt isn't a set time and can be held down as long or as short as you want. Your not a sitting duck if someone comes by during the taunt but can also hold it down to become an instant dispenser. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Solemn Vow** (+) Now you and your heal target can passively see enemy health. (-) Enemies can passively see your health. (-) Can no longer see enemy uber and vice versa. Now it's a bit more overall useful but also has an actual downside. Also you can no longer see uber which is kind of game breaking in a competitive format. So it's essentially now better in pubs and more fair in competitive. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Machina** (+) Shots will hit all players connected by a medi-beam. (-) -25% damage per player hit. (-) -50% reload speed. Now it has a pretty decent yet fitting upside but an actual downside. Also multiple players hit will have a damage reduction so you can't quickscope a pocket and insta-kill the medic. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Classic** (+) Headshots will mini-crit when not at full charge. (+) +25% charge rate. (-) Cannot scope. Now you can still do damage when below a full charge. Also it will fill charge faster but it becomes much harder to kill from afar without being able to scope. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Cleaner's Carbine** (+) ""Crikey"" fills through damage from all slots. (-) Takes 900 damage to fill the meter. Now you can fill it with your primary meaning you don't have to go on smg rampages to fill it up. To compensate, it takes 6 quickscope headshots to fully fill the meter, much more than before. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Razorback** (+) Removed overheal penalty. (+) -35% damage taken from behind. (-) -50% health from all sources. So the update took it from pretty good in highlander and useless in pubs to... useless in highlander and useless in pubs. The recharge doesn't prevent the whole spies from just using their revolver to kill you. The overheal penalty really just removes any use in highlander. Now it doesn't have such an extreme downside and has the ability to do something if there is no spies on your team. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Darwin's Danger Sheild** (+) +10 max health on wearer. So the old version was definitely overpowered, but I'm not too keen on the new one. You can survive a pyro attack, but after all the pyro players die down it won't matter that much. Pyro's are usually not the biggest problem to snipers, so adding a health bonus makes it a bit better and useful for pocketing. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Bushwacka** (+) Mini-crit attacks will give a +20% speed boost for 10 seconds. (+) Damage vulnerability removed. (-) Added -25% swing speed. (-) No longer crits when it would mini-crit. I don't think sniper deserves such a good melee option when paired with jarate. As a sniper you are supposed to dominate at long range but be weak up close, i think this is a good compromise. It still pairs with jarate, just not as powerful. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Tribalman's Shiv** (+) Mini-crits on bleeding players. It is in kind of a weird state currently. It technically does more damage than stock with the bleeding, but that is long term damage. This makes consecutive hits more effective and a good damage combo. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Shahanshah** (=) Stats have been reversed. Now it's a lot less risk-reward and more just getting to the opponent before they get you to below half health. This weapon could be countered easily by just hitting the sniper real quick, but is good for suprise attacks. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Ambassador** *New Design:* (+) Crits on accurate headshot. (+) +25 max health on wearer. (-) Knife cannot backstab. (-) -60% cloak duration. Now it's a sub-class, gun spy! You lose backstabs and cloaking for pure combat ability and extra health. You pretty much have no downsides if you weren't going to cloak or backstab, but it removes a big part of spy. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Enforcer** (+) +20% damage while disguised is changed to +20% damage. (-) +1 second decloak duration. I've suggested this many times, but it basically reverts it to an old design that isn't a straight upgrade with the dead ringer and has slower firing speed. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Diamondback** (-) -20% firing speed. Now you can't fire out your 20 crits for backstabbing the f2p heavy as fast, just a needed nerf for an op weapon. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Your Eternal Reward** (=) Reverted to previous design. (+) +15% speed when active and undiguised. Now it has two better purposes, spy rollouts and getting that first stab much quicker. This helps what made the old design so weak by giving it a real meaningful upside. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Dead Ringer** (+) No longer instantly removes 50% cloak on use. Now that it's not as spammable, making the feign count more would be better. Since you have to wait quite a while to refill it, having 14 seconds of cloak plus the speed boost. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Red Tape Recorder** *New Design* (+) Can be placed on the world. (+) Gives an outline and shows health of all enemies within the radius. (-) Can be removed with all damage. (-) Cannot sap buildings. Credit to u/SileAnimus for this idea, it's a wonderful idea for a sapper. You give up destroying buildings for useful information feeding. It may be a bit useless in causal, but that kind of information feeding would be great in competitive. "

This applies to the special delivery, they barely go together. I will try to make these weapons go together better. **Special Delivery** So the main draw was the extra health. This paired with the mad milk gave incredible survivability, so I'll try to bring that back. *Shortstop:* (+) Added +15% damage resistance while active. (+) Increased reload speed by 25%. (-) Increased knockback vulnerability to 60%. (-) Removed shove mechanic. Now it actually has a good survivability upside but you can be thrown around like crazy. Also i increased the reload speed because it definitely needs it. *Mad Milk* (-) Decreased healing on hit to +45%. Now it's not as effective which helps it for not giving your team a huge advantage. Also it nerfs it a bit so this set isn't too broken. *Holy Mackerel* (+) Now crits on wet players. (-) Added -20% damage penalty. Now it has a decent use of being able to do crit damage on milked enemies and gain health back doing it. It will still retain it's memeness because it's still the slap fish. Ok, these actually seem like weapons built for each other. "
380,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,"[IG/UP] Pyro, again. &lt;Pyro&gt;",1,7hzyzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/7hzyzd/igup_pyro_again_pyro/,2017-12-07 05:19:49,"Pyro! It's a class! It got an update! I have things to say about it! Pyro has finally had the mechanics of its flamethrower reworked and new weapons added with Jungle Inferno, and it made pyro feel fresh and new again! But, all is not well in pyroland. The flamethrower is broken in new and exciting ways, the new unlocks are either underpowered or items that really should've been default changes in the first place, and worst of all many of pyro's unlocks remain rusting in the supply lockers after being untouched by the hands of either Valve or pyro main. In short, pyro was not fixed. Pyro still has no role, and you still use the same old loadouts with perhaps an extra dash of dragon's fury. There weren't even any comp mode changes after waiting well over a year since MYM. So, what does pyro need? It needs a role. Just being another ""generalist"" makes it overshadowed by soldier, and it needs changes to the class itself rather than band aid unlocks to patch its holes. I present 3 approaches to fixing pyro as a ""What should've happened"" with jungle inferno. **PYRO - OFFENSE** *Level 3 Class* ~~**Pyro now has a passive jetpack, press and hold space after a jump to fly in the direction you're facing, this jetpack has limited fuel so be careful.**~~ ~~Flamethrower fires an arcing, limited-range stream of fire similar to real life flamethrowers, imagine the ratchet &amp; clank lava gun. The farther away your opponent the more you must lead them. 7 base damage per 20th of a second for 175 DPS at point blank. Afterburn duration increases the longer you burn a target from 2 seconds to 8 over 1 second of burning.~~ ~~Extinguishing a player's afterburn does not heal you, but instead repays ammo equal to airblast cost +5, max 1 ammo payback per airblast.~~ There is one thing all other offensive classes have in common: They can pick their battles, and they have advanced movement to provide skill indexing and a nice power and skill curve. If pyro wishes to be an offense class, it needs increased movement tech PASSIVELY. Simply giving pyro unlocks or a base speed increase will make it more frustrating for newcomers or lock the power of the class behind unlocks like the degreaser and axtinguisher did during their dynasty. The Lava-Thrower allows a pyro to spread afterburn, but also gives it a weapon that requires careful aiming to be effective. **PYRO - DEFENSE** *Level 3 Class* ~~**+25 max health on class**~~ ~~*Reflected projectiles no longer minicrit. Reflecting is a tool to help allies and yourself, not a weapon.*~~ ~~Flamethrower particles reduced in size by 40%, now counts damage by individual particle once again, dealing 7 base damage per particle for a maximum of 175 DPS at point blank.~~ ~~Extinguishing a player's afterburn does not heal you, but instead repays ammo equal to airblast cost +5, max 1 ammo payback per airblast.~~ Pyro has excellent DPS, Damage over time effects, and nasty surprises like airblast which make it pretty effective at holding the enemy back. Unfortunately pyro is capable of no more burst damage than an engineer, resulting in said engineer being able to win 1v1s with a pyro far, far more often than one should. For good damage, you need the health, speed, or range to get it out there. The Defense path for pyro takes a point from heavy for increased health, buying it the staying power to hold areas and let its damage output kick in. The flamethrower works like pyro's old flamethrower, but slightly more powerful and a bit less broken. **PYRO - SUPPORT** *Level 3 Class* ~~**In addition to damage over time, afterburn makes the afflicted player suffer 25% damage vulnerability rather than reducing healing. Damage vuln includes flamethrower damage. (with such a change in mind some flare guns may need to be nerfed.)**~~ ~~*Reflected projectiles no longer minicrit. Reflecting is a tool to help allies and yourself, not a weapon.*~~ ~~Flamethrower particle boxes are shrank by 40%, Afterburn duration increases based on duration of flame contact, from 2 to 8 seconds after 1 second of direct fire.~~ ~~Extinguishing a player's afterburn does not heal you, but instead repays ammo equal to airblast cost +5, max 1 ammo payback per airblast.~~ Pyro has bleh movement, decent damage, and alright health. This reminds me of one thing: Support classes. They make up for their lack of combat presence with buffs, debuffs, and the raw burst damage to instantly kill opponenents. That said, buffs would just get pyro compared to medic, and we have enough difficulty balancing the pick classes we have, so pyro has become the red mage of our party: A debuffer who retains fair combat prowess in a pinch. The flamethrower works a lot like the way it does now, but with smaller hitboxes as well as duration based damage and afterburn to stop the mouse flailing sensation. I was going to include some rebalances here but I'm out of time today, hopefully these changes give you something to think about and so I ask you: What do you want pyro to be? How can it be made more skill indexed without directly buffing it too much?"

I decided to try and re-balance this weapon as a utility to compete with the Powerjack. Since they've gone and nerfed all the healing benefits the Powerjack used to have, why not give them to the underdog? These changes would go with an additional change to the Powerjack that would remove its +25 health on kill."

The issue I have with the weapon is not its damage per se, but with its alt fire ability, the shove. Simply put, it has **no purpose.** So, what do you do to give it a purpose? (I dont think valve will remove it because it already has animations in place). My suggestion is simple. Have it **mini-crit airborne targets** like the direct hit. (Yes, its a gimmick. I couldnt think of anything else). This wouldnt necessarily be op, since the damage it would deal is the same as a scatter guns meatshot *and* the shove is weak, so the person firing could only hit them about twice. The airborne target can also airstrafe to dodge the bullets. Thats one idea, suggest more if you have other ones."

385,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,(UP) 27 Buffs for the Jungle Inferno Update,3,771g3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/771g3c/up_27_buffs_for_the_jungle_inferno_update/,2017-10-18 07:36:29,"So if you don't know, a while ago a youtuber named Cosmic Afro made a poll asking various questions about each class. In each poll, he asked what weapons need a buff for each class. So for my final balance thing before the update, i will buff the weapons most needed of a buff for every weapon slot. This'll be a long one boys, strap yourselves in. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Baby Face's Blaster** (+) Changed the damage needed to empty the boost to 75. (+) Reduced boost lost on jump to -50%. (-) Increased damage needed to fill boost to 150. This makes getting fool boost slightly harder but makes losing it harder. Now stray bullets won't take away over 10% of your meter. The only big meter draining things will be stuff that gets you close to death anyway. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol** *New Design:* (+) Overheal decays 75% slower while active. (+) Has a passive +50% falling damage resistance. (+) +30% health from sources while active. (-) -75% clip size (3 shots). (-) -60% damage penalty. (-) -50% reload speed. This makes it a good self support weapon at cost of the damage of stock. You can still defend yourself, but you do very miniscule damage. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Sun on a Stick** (+) On Hit: Removes all debuffs from hit teammate (fire, jarate, marked for death, etc.). (+) -50% less time on debuffs given to you. (So 5 second afterburn or a max 4 second sandman stun). (-) Removed crits on burning enemies. (-) Removed fire resistance while active. So this makes it a good team/self support weapon. You can help your team out and do it good with your increased speed. It also makes negative effects less damaging. It's still situational and gimmicky, but more useful. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Liberty Launcher** (+) Rockets have 25% more knockback. This is a small change but it helps quite a lot. You not only can knock away enemies and make reserve shooter shots better, you have better rocket jumps. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Righteous Bison** (+) Increased projectile speed by 30%. (+) Decreased damage lost on penetration to 10%. (-) Cannot be crit boosted. This is a good medium between the current and previous versions. The problem was it could do massive damage with a kritzkreig. This makes it so it can't pair with the kreig but can still be usable. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Equalizer** *New Design:* (+) While Active: Gain damage resistance based on health (0% at max, 50% at less than 41). (+) +30% damage increase. (-) Marked for Death for 2 seconds after holster. (-) Blocks healing while active. (-) +100% holster speed. This makes good for taking damage when at low health and for running in and doing damage. I'm not 100% sure if this is balanced, so I'll have to see feedback. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Phlogistinator** *New Design:* (+) +20% damage on wet players. (+) Alt-Fire: Launches a gasoline ball for 100 ammo that adds a jarate effect to hit enemies. (-) No airblast. This makes it good for team support but you can still do massive damage. Granted, it's not as much as full crits, but you can do it more often to get a big advantage. (Yes i know this wasn't the most requested for a change, but i didn't want to buff the degreaser). ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Manmelter** (+) Alt-fire now removes all debuffs on teammates. Crits will stack with stacked debuffs. This is a small change, but it helps quite a bit. Now it's easier to get the crits and it can do things that normal airblast can't. It still might not be used, but this change will help. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Sharpened Volcano Fragment** (+) On Hit: Marks enemy for death for 15 seconds. (-) Increased damage penalty to -40%. (-) Can only mark one target at a time. This gives it a much better reason to use the weapon rather than just using your primary. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Loch'n'Load** (+) Changed +20% damage to buildings to +15% damage. (+) Bombs now explode on hitting a surface. (+) Removed explosion size penalty. (-) Decreased clip to -50% (2 shots). (-) Removed faster projectile speed. (-) -50% explosion radius on surfaces. This makes it good for dealing increased damage and going for direct hits. You can miss shots slightly but still do extra damage. As a payoff, you have less clip and you don't shoot faster. I'm not sure if this is a good deign or not, but I'd have to see. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Scottish Resistance** (+) Removed arm time decrease. (-) Does -50% damage for the first .8 seconds. (-) Decreased firing rate to +10%. This makes it usuable to spam, but is still much worse at it and is better for making traps. Because it might be a bit op now, i reduced the firing speed you can't spam as fast. This is another I'm a bit unsure about, and i don't honestly think it needs a buff. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Ullapool Caber** (+) Reduced self-damage by 30%. (+) Now has a 20 second recharge on the explosion. (+) Reduced deploy time to -50%. This makes you not take as much damage on explosion and it isn't a straight downgrade after the first swing, you can now recharge as much as you want. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Huo-long Heater** (+) -10% damage changed to -10% damage to burning players. (+) Fire ring now extinguishes burning teammates. (-) Afterburn time decreased to 5 seconds. This makes you actually do +25% damage to burning players and helps you support your team better. Though now the afterburn doesn't last as long. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Buffalo Steak Sandvich** (+) Damage and vulnerability now last until you holster your melee weapon. This doesn't apply to speed. (-) Melee weapons holster 100% slower after effects run out. This makes it so you can attack forever if you so please. You can't continue to run at extra speed though. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Warrior's Spirit** (+) Crits when it would normally mini-crit. This is a small change but an effective one. This makes it pair well with the steak to die in one hit but also kill everything in one hit. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Pomson 600** (+) Projectile penetrates targets. (+) On Hit: Cloaked spies are revealed for .3 seconds longer. (+) Increased base damage to 55. (-) Removed uber and cloak drain. This makes it good for doing long range damage and for hitting multiple targets. The uber drain had to go because penetrating a heavy to hit the medic and remove uber is a bit unfair. To counter this, spies are easier to track. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Short Circut** (=) Now uses it's own ammo with 20 for primary fire and 5 for secondary. (+) Increased base damage to 10. (-) 2 second reload for both clips. This makes it less spammable but at the same time not eat up your metal. You can also do a bit more damage with primary fire. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Southern Hospitality** *New Design:* (+) Up to +4 health gained per second on wearer. (+) -50% cost on dispensers. (+) +700% faster dispenser build time. (+) +50% dispenser range. (-) Cannot upgrade dispenser. (-) -33% health on dispensers. (-) Dispensers lose 1 max health per second out. (-) Dispensers do not drop gibs. So that's a lot of stats, but basically you get a mini-dispenser. It'll be faster and cheaper, but have less health and can only be out for 100 seconds. The perk is you can build another and they reach much farther. I thought the whole bleed thing was boring, so this spices it up a little. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Overdose** (+) Changed speed based on uber to +15% speed while active. (-) -25% damage vulnerability while active. This makes it a better rollout weapon that you don't need full ubercharge to actually use. It's now a sort of powerjack but for the medic. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Vaccinator** (+) Resistance bubbles now protect 20% of that damage type. (+) Decreased overheal build penalty to -33%. (-) Reduced uber build to +40%. This makes the weapon less reliant on constantly ubering due to the extra damage resist normally. Also you can build overheal faster, which is neat. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Classic** (+) Headshots that aren't fully charged will mini-crit. (-) Reduced bodyshot damage penalty to 20%. This makes it not as bad when you aren't fully charged. To compensate, you can't one shot bodyshot light classes anymore. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Cleaners Carbine** (+) On Kill: Gain full crits for 5 seconds. (+) Reduced firing speed to -20%. (-) Removed the crikey meter. This gives you fill crits with 1 kill rather than mini-crits for a lot of damage. This makes it better for burst damage in the now. Also slightly faster firing speed so you can kill 5% faster. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Shahanshah** *New Design* (+) Gives sniper a passive 10% speed when above 75% health. (-) Has a passive -15% speed when below 75% health. This makes it good for rolling out and dodging shots. Once someone damages you, you are going to have a hard time getting away. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Enforcer** (+) Changed +20% damage when disguised to +20% damage. (-) Added +1 second decloak time. This brings it back to the original, except it isn't a straight upgrade with the dead ringer. This'll make it do more damage, but it's not as overpowered. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Your Eternal Reward** (+) Move 10% faster while active. This will help spy be able to get that first stab easier and escape easier. It will also be good for spy rollouts, which can be helpful. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Cloak and Dagger** *New Design:* (+) +100% longer cloak time. (+) No blink when cloaked. (-) -40% cloak from ammo packs. (-) +.5 seconds longer decloak time. (-) Decloak sound is louder than stock (not as loud as the dead ringer). This weapon is hard to balance in it's current state. I decided that i would try to make a weapon with a similar premise, but better. Now you can go much further and you don't blink, but it's gonna be harder to get it back up. Also decloaking is a lot more punishing now. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ And that's all. I didn't do the RTR because i don't have any good ideas to balance it, so i just didn't. I was a bit unsure on some of these, but I'm sure I'll be told in several different comments what i did wrong. "

It's upside and downside are both very boring and situational, and both of them are only relevant against one class. So I've tried to come up with some new stats to replace the current ones, intending to keep them as uncomplicated as possible: **Southern Hospitality V1** *Level X Wrench* ~~**Gives increased dispenser range**~~ ~~**Gives a speed boost to teleporter players**~~ ~~*+20% damage vulnerability while active*~~ Your dispenser gains increased range, and your teammates will receive a speed boost after using your teleporter. The range and speed boosts start off low at level 1, and can be increased through upgrading your dispenser/teleporter. The downside (which isn't too inspiring and I think could be changed) is an increased damage vulnerability to everything whenever the weapon is active, so you have to be more cautious when you're building and maintaining your equipment. This first variant is more support-oriented, and encourages supporting your team by giving everyone extra benefits from using your dispenser and teleporter, in exchange for you keeping them alive. Dispenser range increase: Level 1: +50% Level 3: +75% Level 3: +100% Teleporter speed boost: Level 1: +15% for 1 second Level 2: +25% for 2 seconds Level 3: +35% for 3 seconds **Southern Hospitality V2** *Level X Wrench* ~~**+35% more supplies from packs**~~ ~~**+15% faster weapon switch**~~ ~~*&lt;Insert appropriate downside here&gt;*~~ You receive a passive bonus of 1/3 more ammo, metal and health gained from pickups, and your weapon switch speed is increased by 15%. The downside, I left blank for now, as I couldn't think of anything suitable at the time. This second variant takes partial inspiration from the Back Scratcher, and is aimed at keeping you alive and active for longer, and makes going off to collect metal for your buildings a bit more rewarding."

So I've got nothing better to do than to do more balance changes. So I'll do medic because his meta is staler than a 8 year old piece of bread and he desperately needs this. I will be touching every single medic weapon this time (except stock medi and kritz), so he will be completely different. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Syringe Gun** (+) Increased ramp-up to 150% (max syringe damage to 15). This is a small change, but it makes the syringe gun slightly more viable. With the changes I'll be making to the crossbow, it shouldn't need buffing. Though for right now, this'll do. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Blutsauger** (+) Increased healing per hit to 5 (+) No longer drains hp passively. (+) Syringes move 50% faster. (-) Costs 2 hp to shoot each syringe. (-) -30% firing speed. So the current problem with this is that you have less healing whether it's active or not. This change makes it not effect you during normal gameplay and is only a passive downside. Now it rewards you for hitting your shots but punishes missing. Also the less firing speed can actually benefit you so you can hit shots better. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Overdose** (+) Speed based on Ubercharge is changed to +15% speed while active. (+) Removed damage penalty. (-) 25% damage vulnerability while active. This makes it more useful for rollouts and escape without the need for filing your uber meter. It also has the damage vulnerability that most speed weapons have. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Crusaders Crossbow** (+) Increased base healing to 90 (180 at max range). (-) -1 health drained per second on wearer. (-) Decreased base damage to 20 (about 40 at a range). This won't 100% ruin the weapon, but it sure nerfs it. It emphasizes the healing portion but also increases the loss of self-defense. If you need survivability, it would be advised not to use this. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **All Medi-Guns** (+) Increased normal uber build to 3% per second. (-) Uber build loss decreased to when a patient is 125% or over. (-) Uber build on 125%+ health patients stays the same. This seems small, but it changes quite a bit to how uber is built. Now you build uber slightly faster than before but the uber built on overhealed patients is the same. Also this nerfs the quik-fix because you now will actually lose uber build on overhealed teammates. Overall the change discourages pocketing even more. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Quick-Fix** (-) Removed 10% faster uber build and added -10% uber build. This is simple, but it makes the fix a more to be a staple healer with less on using your charges. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ That's all for now, I'll do the rest later."

Strap yourself in because I'm going to balance the baby eater himself, soldier. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **All Rocket Launchers** (-) Self damage on rocket jump increased to 30-55 damage based on where you hit. Soldier is a generalist, making him ideal for competitive. He has more health, high damage, and insane mobility without much cost. Increasing rocket jump damage makes it much riskier to be rocket jumping. It may seem small, but it can hurt in dire situations. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Direct Hit** (-) +25% more self damage taken. This makes close range hits much more risky and rocket jumping even more damaging. Not too huge but it balances it out well and makes sense with the increased damage. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Black Box** (+) Removed clip size penalty. (-) Added a passive -35% healing from all sources (except healing from self healing weapons). This makes it good for healing yourself in a pinch but you heal less from other sources. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Liberty Launcher** (+) Rockets give 15% more knockback. This gives it a pretty interesting use by letting you knock enemies back for combos or just to get them away from you. You can also rocket jump further, which is quite a good upgrade. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Cow Mangler 5000** (+) Charge shot will only take up 2 clip, but still needs 4 to use. (-) Afterburn duration cut to 3 seconds. (-) Sentry disablement decreased to 2 seconds. This makes you less defenseless after using a charge shot, but the shot isn't as effective. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Air Strike** (=) Replaced clip size increasing on kill to +50% clip size. (+) Removed base explosion radius penalty. (-) Now fires 10% slower on the ground. This makes it more effective in short term, but worse in the long term. Also it's slightly worse on the ground now, just a tiny nerf. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Buff Banner** (+) Gives a passive +15% firing speed on all weapons. This gives it a passive effect, which is what makes the other banners stronger. This allows more self support to the banner, making it useful when you have no charge. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Concheror** (-) Time needed to get to 4 hp/s increased by 100%. This makes the passive healing a bit less effective, nothing too big. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **B.A.S.E. Jumper** (+) Take 25% less fall damage passively, regardless of the parachute being out. This makes it effective when you need to retract the chute for a dodge so it doesn't become useless. It also lessens the reliance on using the parachute. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Equalizer** *New Design:* (+) Regenerates health per second based on health while active (0 at minimum and 5 at max). (-) -75% holster speed. (-) -75% healing and uber rate from medics. This makes it good for getting health back when you are low, but it's risky to pull out and medics can't heal you as fast. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Pain Train** (+) +15% speed when carrying the intelligence/PASS time jack. (-) Increased bullet vulnerability to 15%. This gives it a use in ctf, nothing too big. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Disciplinary Action** (-) Consecutive hits reduces speed boost by 15% to a max of -60% (This wears off after 10 seconds). This makes it less effective after every hit, making it good for small burts of speed. This is good for 2 or 3 hits and then you jump away rather than whipping them all the way. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Escape Plan** (+) Removed -90% healing from medics. (-) Passive -75% health and uber rate from medics. This makes the downside a lot more devastating because you pretty much just need a health pack to refill health."

And it's not a straight up nerf to stock when you are not capturing. Also, since it would be available on Pyro, he would really fit more snugly into a defensive playstyle, as before, all Pyro had going for her was his airblast and MAYBE the Scorch Shot's knockback.

(+) Alt-Fire: Share with a friend (medium health kit). (=) Effects last 16 seconds. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ So i changed 3 main things on this weapon. Most importantly, you can now switch weapons under the effects. This makes it so you can still defend yourself from ranged attacks, but it takes slower to pull out. Next is that you get a speed boost on hit rather than a normal speed boost. This makes rollouts less effective and so you can't be a super speed heavy with a minigun out. Finally it heals you so you can get a little bit of health before you rush in blindly. I also slightly increased vulnerability for balance sake. (Looking on the wiki, apparently the damage vulnerability is gone, so i guess I'm re adding it.)"

Additionally, it also fires 10% faster, increasing it's damage output. The downside is that you take 20% more damage from everything as long as the weapon is deployed, so you have to be more careful with your positioning as you'll become even more of a target to enemy players. The faster firing speed also means you'll spend ammo quicker, which thus requires you to keep an extra eye on your ammo. You essentially take more abuse while in exchange giving teammates more battle power. The effects would stack with other damage boosts/resistances, but wouldn't stack with other Heavies using the same weapon, i.e you can't have a load of Heavies next to each other boosting each other and nearby teammates for silly amounts of damage and resistance. The buffs would apply to Engineer buildings, so you can give friendly Engineer's a helping hand by giving their Sentry some extra strength. I think the stats are decent enough, though it could maybe do with an extra upside (and downside) to jazz it up a bit, as overall it's just a more riskier stock minigun with that has added buff effects. Edit 1: Added firing speed bonus."

It's not because he's hard to balance for, i just really haven't looked that deep into his weapons that much. I had to do a bit of testing to do this and I've had this idea in the back of my head for about two weeks now. After a while of testing demo in game and rewriting notes many times, here is demoman balance ideas. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Loch'n'Load** (+) Now have an overall +15% damage increase. (+) Launched bombs now explode on surfaces. (-) Removed projectile speed bonus. (-) Explosion radius only applies on surface exploded bombs. This just straight up removes the projectile speed and makes it not just for hitting pipes. Now it's a damage dealer that doesn't have rollers and has less clip size. Overall this makes it less of a 'crutch' and more for extra damage. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Loose Cannon** (+) Base damage increased to 80. (-) Time between hit and explosion to trigger double donk reduced to 1/3 of a second. This may seem small, but it helps a lot. It makes you less reliant on constant double donks making you not have to nail perfect shots to get good damage output. It also makes double donks able to one shot medics, so that's a plus. This all comes at a cost of making double donks more precise. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Ali Baba's Wee Booties** (+) +1 health regenerated per second on wearer. (-) Removed melee kills refilling your charge meter. This gives an overall useful ability for sticky and knight playstyles and removes a stat that is largely not the most important to have. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Stickybomb Launcher** (+) Decreased self damage to 30-90. (-) Reduced base damage to 110. Ok so the sticky launcher is the main weapon for demo, and that's not that bad. I just kind of want to put a bit more focus back on your primary by reducing damage a bit. To compensate, you can be mobile with a bit less risk because you take less damage from sticky jumps. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Scottish Resistance** (+) Sticky bombs take 75% less knockback after being armed. (+) Firing speed increases by 2% for every sticky out. This makes traps harder to destroy and getting everything set up even faster. It's still probably going to be underused, but that's more to due with the weapon idea itself. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Sticky Jumper** (+) Max stickies out incresed to -4. This semi-reverts the changes of long ago but it still limits you in how many you can have out. This makes for incredibly far jumps on open maps, even more than we have now. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **All Sheilds** (+) Now have 100% more turning control. (+) Only have to charge 45% to get a full crit and 20% for mini-crit. So now you can actually maneuver a bit more when charging, making you not waste a charge if they simply step away. Also you can do extra damage sooner so now you can charge at closer ranges. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Chargin' Targe** (+) Increased explosion resistance to +40%. (-) Decreased fire vulnerability to +40%. Now you can survive explosives better when charging and the stats are a bit more even. I mean, the targe is used for resistances, so why not increase one that is a bit more useful. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Tide Turner** (+) Increased both resistances to +20%. (+) Taking damage no longer decreases charge meter. (-) Melee kills only refill 25% of your charge meter. (-) Sheild bash only does 25 damage. This makes it more as a getting away and mobility tool. You take less damage and have full turning control, but it's less rewarding to try to go in for a kill. This makes it better for hybrid knights who need a good mobility tool but still use their primary. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Eyelander** (-) Heads no longer increase charge bash damage. This weapon increases a lot of things with heads and it leads it to being a very used weapon. I don't want to remove the health or speed, so i got rid of the stat that i completely forgot about. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Ullapool Caber** (+) Mini-crits when airborne. (+) Explosion has a 30 second recharge timer before a new one comes in. (-) Decreased explosion damage to 115. This makes it much more useful overall. The explosion won't normally kill but will when airborne, making it more skilled based and not as annoying. It also doesn't make it a 1 time thing with the recharge. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ That's it. Looking back I'm actually pretty ok with most of his melees, it's the primaries and secondaries that are the most imbalanced. Also I've reached the point where I've rebalanced every class twice, so that's cool. "

This requires an extra pill against other demos, giving those with stock a definite advantage, and punishing a missed shot. All in all, making players much more of a threat while using this. In exchange, repairing buildings while under fire from the LochnLoad; 80 HP per swing as opposed to 100. Not 100% convinced on that stat, was considering making it Pierces Wrangler Shield, but that feels too niche but thats a pretty common niche. Want to hear opinions on this one. **Chargin' Targe** ~~**Reduced knockback on wearer**~~ This shield is just outclassed by the Splendid Screen. While the Screen does have lower resists, they're not that much different, and the recharge rate will keep you alive in many situations where the Targe wouldn't. So... let's make it the Anti-pyro shield. And with a knockback resist (about half) from all sources, it would just make your charges and demoknighting more consistent overall. **Ullapool Caber** ~~**Weapon deals critical hits while blast jumping**~~ Theres been numerous requests for a Demo Market Gardener, but were forgetting he already has one. The Caber even has the slower swing speed already. May need to be tested to decide if crits or minicrits. **Claidheamh Mor** ~~**Increased Charge duration.**~~ ~~*Health on kill removed*~~ ~~*Weapon can not deal a critical hit from a charge*~~ I have a rule; if Im reverting a change, I have to understand why the change was made in the first place. I had a hard time trying to figure out why the charge was removed, but the recent changes proposed for the Jungle update lead me to believe they may have found Demos using it to appear randomly, and the team may have felt that being killed by it felt arbitrary. So. No full crit on charge? **Natascha** ~~**-25% damage reduced to -15%**~~ ~~*Removed damage resistance*~~ See below **The Brass Beast** ~~**-60% knockback while spun up**~~ ~~**Damage Resistance changed from -20% to -33%**~~ Currently the Natascha and Brass Beast have pretty comparable stats. Which doesnt make much sense as Natascha is supposed to be about trapping an enemy under its fire, securing more kills, while the Beast is the immovable wall of damage and health. The damage resistance on the Nat means your entrapped enemies dont just kill you, but its damage penalty means that even when you have someone trapped you didnt kill them. So its just annoying without really resulting in any great difference in performance. Meanwhile, The Brass Beast takes so long to get into position, and can be very easily screwed up by pushing the Heavy around, or just leaving him as hes a sitting duck. Now, hes harder to move, and can tank a solid amount of damage. **Buffalo Steak Sandvich** ~~**Change 25% damage vulnerability to 15% damage resistance**~~ ~~*User is marked for death for 5 seconds after the effect wears off*~~ The Steak simply make heavy too vulnerable to damage while basically becoming a demoknight without a charge, or awesomely powerful melees. With the damage resistances now provided, Heavies with the steak are a force to be reckoned with but still easily manageable by anyone with decent movement or a basic understanding of knockback. However, the idea of Heavy-to-mid on 5CP has terrified the comp community for a long time. And there is good reason for that, so its something we need to address. So if you do use it to make it to mid, youre taking minicrits while doing so, making it a lot less frightening to see a heavy right out the gates. **Family Business** ~~**-20% deploy time**~~ ~~**-20% hollister time**~~ ~~*+25% reload time*~~ The Family Business is a pretty decent weapon already, just a little uninteresting. So lets run with the idea of a faster shotgun; you can pull it out and put it away faster. However, with it being faster to unload and having a larger clip, it punishes you for wasting shots and poor aim. **Warriors Spirit** Not going to change this one, just pointing out to show I didnt forget them. Honestly, I think with the changes to the steak, they could become decent. Maybe being a one-trick-pony isnt too glamorous, but theyd be decent. With the changes to the steak, we could take a closer look at the Spirit and perhaps make changes as needed from there. **Rescue Ranger** ~~*-50% damage*~~ The RR is the utility that doesnt sacrifice too much. It has the same damage as a shotgun, just slightly harder to hit and with a slightly smaller clip. Now, its an all-your-eggs-in-one-basket style weapon, forcing you to rely on your sentry, melee, or pistol for damage. **Pomson 6000** ~~**Increased projectile speed from 1200 HU/s to 1500 HU/s**~~ ~~*Only drains active Ubers*~~ This increases the projectile to the speed of a Liberty Launcher Rocket, Loch-n-Load pill, Loose Cannon ball, or Grappling Hook. This should make the Pomson more consistent overall, and easier to hit targets with. Meanwhile, at the moment the Pomson can NOT drain active ubers. So while I listed this as a downgrade, its really a sidegrade. Now, it can shorten ubers, giving the Engie a choice; Use the RR to keep the gun up and bug out if things get too hot, or keep the gun up by reducing the effectiveness of the uber. Keep in mind he has to be within LOS of an ubered medic and his cohorts to do so; inherent risk. **Wrangler** ~~*Engineer Marked For Death while active and 3 seconds after*~~ The main issue with the Wrangler is that; while he has teammates to support him, an Engineer with the Wrangler is incredibly hard to challenge (far from impossible). By Marking for Death, this means the decision to pull out the Wrangler is one that must be made deliberately and with good sense; taking it out when there's a rocket or pill coming your way could be instant death, leaving your gun extremely vulnerable.

All unlocks retain this stat**~~ Medic Primaries have always been massively overshadowed by the Crossbow. Now, a decently common suggestion is to give all they Syringe Guns a burst healing option. Personally I see this like saying the Black Box is overpowered so all Rocket Launchers should have a health-on-hit mechanic. All this does is lead to boring and uninteresting weapons. **Overdose** ~~**Dealing damage charges your ""Dosage""**~~ ~~**Right Click to active (does not need to be full) to gain +5 HP/s and immunity to crits**~~ ~~*Removed Speed boost based on Ubercharge*~~ ~~*Changing to a different weapon while charge is active removes effects and expends 10% charge*~~ The Overdose. The weapon everyone wants to be good. Better than those that hate it think, worse than those that use it think. Charge would take 200 damage to fill completely, and last 10 seconds on full charge. The reason I didnt go down the whole passive path is: Medic is already the second fastest class in the game. The only one that can keep pace with him is the Spy, and the only one that can outrun him is the scout. If you know a spys here, hes already failed, and if hes succeeded you dont have a chance to run. If you are being chased by a scout, 20% doesnt change the fact he can still get you. So, even if it was passive, its debatable if it would even be decent. But this invalidates the base concept; Increasing Medics speed doesnt help him. But lets go beneath the concept and look at the role it wants to address; an escape weapon. Pull it out while making a retreat, helping you to escape with your life. With regen and no nasty crits, this is the perfect Abandon Ship weapon. **Blutsauger** ~~**+3 Health on hit increased to +5 health on hit**~~ The syringe Gun for the medics that dont need a babysitter. A simply change that just makes surviving a little easier and more viable. Dont need an essay on this one. **Crusaders Crossbow** ~~*-75% max primary ammo increased to -88%*~~ ~~*Reduced base damage from 75 to 50*~~ So the Crossbow is just out of control. It presents bursts healing, in exchange for very little. With copious amounts of spare ammo, and passive reload, this thing is LESS hassle than using the stock. So, I gave the others the passive reload, made ammo an actual consideration, and reduced the medics ability to fend for himself. You give up your ability to care for yourself, in exchange for the ability to care for your team more. **Vaccinator** ~~**Now provides 10% resistance to all three types**~~ ~~**Selected type provides 20% resistance**~~ ~~*-20% Heal Rate*~~ Uber still increases the 20% resistance to 75%, and retains the 10%s. Just making the Vac a little more reliable and useful, without the gigantic achilles heel to focus fire. Still very weak to that, but no where near as bad. However, in exchange for this, youre giving up 20% healing. While underfire youll be healed slower, while reducing burst damage. Meanwhile, outside of combat you heal slower. The irony of a weapon named for preventive medicine being a reactive medigun retained. **Uber Saw** ~~*Uber gained on hit reduced to 15%*~~ Had a tough time deciding between 20% or 15%. I believe 15% provides a solid reward for such a high risk, but leaves room for other saws to be a thing. **Sniper Rifle** ~~*Can no longer deal criticals for 0.5 seconds after scoping*~~ The idea here is to simply slow the sniper down, and force him to endure the downsides of being scoped in. Changes to stock transfer to all unlockable rifles. **Sydney Sleeper** ~~*Added -20% damage*~~ With the added charge rate, the Sleeper can currently put out damage comparable (but still lesser) than a stock rifle, and can still potentially one-shot most classes. By reducing the damage to 120 maximum (40 damage normally), this weapon is forced into the support role it was made for. **Bazaar Bargain** ~~*+33% reload time*~~ The idea here is to simply give the Bargain a downside that cant be negated with a couple of headshots. Time between shots 1.5s -&gt; 2s. **Bushwacka** ~~**Removed 20% damage vulnerability**~~ ~~*-10% move speed while active*~~ ~~*-25% damage*~~ Removing the extremely forgettable damage vulnerability, and lowering the critical damage down to 146 damage, should hopefully bring this weapon more inline; No longer an instant kill against all except soldiers (if theyre that rare America at 200 HP) and heavies, while making the combo more difficult to pull off by making the Sniper slower, meaning it must be used tactically and is truly a hail-Mary combo.

I'm not 100% sure about this one, it could be overpowered or it could make not much of a difference. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Concherer** So this is the most used one and i can see the reason. You get faster build rate and some good healing, so I'm going to change it just slightly. (-) Increased time needed to get to 4 health per second by 50%. (-) Increased damage to charge to 500.

(+) Push back reduction now includes airblast. (+) Wearer takes no fall damage. (+) Increased falling damage to x10. Now it's less risky to use for hitting a player and it does much more damage. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Reserve Shooter** Must i even say it? Well i will, this weapon isn't really that bad in Soldier, but could be changed. (-) Removed increased deploy and holster speed. (+) Added -30% bullet spread. So now it is a bit slower to pull out but it can give more damage from a distance. Also it's slightly better as a standalone weapon. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Righteous Bison** (+) Increased projectile speed back to what it was before meet your match. (+) Decreased damage lost on penetration to only 10%. (-) Added can't be crit boosted. I am pretty sure the reason for the nerf was the trolling with a kritz. You can do 3x damage and penetrate enemies, which could be annoying.

This time i will go much more in depth and change more weapons. So enough time wasting, let's get right in. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Scout** (+) Holding down space after a double jump will speed your fall up and releasing goes back to normal speed. (+) +100% more air control after a double jump. (+) Increase speed cap to 200% One problem i have with scout is you can dodge one rocket, but then fall in a predictable arc to be hit. This allows for extra dodging after double jump and increases Scout's overall mobility. Also the speed cap so extra speed boosts aren't pointless when at full bfb boost. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Scattergun** (+) Max rampup increased to 200% (from 175%). (-) Has +30% more bullet spread compared to the shotgun. This will likely be my most controversial change, but i have a reason. The only difference between the shot and scattergun is the damage rampup. This change fits the name and rewards close range attacks. I think it fits the scout, but i don't know about it too much. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Force-a-Nature** (-) Removed 20% more pellets per shot. (-) Damage penalty increased to -15%. The problem with the FaN is it has almost no downsides. This change makes it much less damage oriented and more for knockback. The extra pellets for less damage counter themselves, so now it just does less damage. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Shortstop** (+) Removed 20% increase in push force while active. (+) Now reloads +50% faster. (-) Removed alt-fire push. This brings it back to the original design, a more precise scattergun but more damaging pistol. It had a decent reload speed, which helped it. It may still not be the most competitively viable, but it's fun. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Soda Popper** (-) Added -15% damage penalty. (+) Decreased damage needed for hype to 400. The soda popper really has only one downside which is countered by its high dps. This brings it closer to the FaN and gives it another downside. To counter this, it needs less damage to fill hype. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Baby Face's Blaster** (+) Now start off with 100% boost. (+) Removed clip size penalty. (+) Removed boost lost on hit and double jump. (-) Boost now drains over time, taking 25 seconds to drain. (-) You can't double jump when below 75% boost. (-) Increased speed penalty to -20%. This gives the boost a good value after getting it full, but you have to constantly deal damage. It rewards doing constant damage with your high speed, but punishes not doing damage. It'll also be good for rollouts. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Back Scatter** (+) Removed clip size penalty. (+) Replaced accuracy penalty to +20% more accurate. (-) Added -25% damage penalty from the front. Now this weapon does it's job right. It rewards flanking but punishes trying to hit enemies from the front. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Bonk! Atomic Punch** (+) Now 50% more resistant to knockback while under the effects. (-) Marked for Death for 5 seconds after effects wear out. This now punishes being in bad positioning after usage and helps you not get bounced around by sentry guns so often. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Crit-a-Cola** (-) Increased damage vulnerability to -25%. (-) Increased marked for death duration to 3 seconds. Now it's a bit more risky to use. This brings it back to being a glass cannon and having to pick your battles right. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ And that's where i end. I will tackle the next part another day. Also feedback is appreciated, I'm not the ultimate balance master."

This gives the mad milk some better protection against pyros. You can milk a team mate, but the pyro could always come back and light them on fire. With this change, you can protect them even more. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol** (+) Removed firing speed penalty. (+) Removed damage vulnerability. (+) Added a passive -50% falling damage. (-) Removed no falling damage while active. (-) Added -1 health drained per second while active. (-) Added -50% damage penalty. (-) Added -30% deploy and holster time. So that's quite a lot of changes. Now the pistol is similar to the blutsauger in which you drain health. It also does less damage and switches slower for balance. Also i put a middle ground between passive or non-passive falling damage. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Flying Guillotine** (+) Base damage increased to 75. (+) Stunned players take bleed damage. (-) No longer causes bleed. (-) Crits on stunned players changed to mini-crits on stunned players. So my idea is to nerf the sandman combo, but not remove it. You can still do 100 damage plus the 60 bleed, but it's not as powerful. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Sandman** (-) Stunned players do not lose any speed. (-) Ball speed changed to 2500 HU/s (+) Minimum stun time increased to 2 seconds. So this change makes comboing much harder and stunning less life threatening. Also the ball is slightly harder to hit now. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Candy Cane** (+) Damage vulnerability reduced to 20%. This change just allows you to survive a grenade, granted with 5 health. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Sun On A Stick** (+) Second successful hit lights enemies on fire. This gives the 3 hit combo of the gunslinger on to a scout weapon or you can hit twice and leave the enemy to burn. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Fan-o-War** (+) Gain a 15% speed boost for 3 seconds after marking an enemy. (-) Removed that it crits when it would mini-crit. This makes it easy to escape after marking an enemy. Normally you would hit an enemy and they would kill you right after. Now you can actually escape. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Atomizer** (+) Removed slower swing speed. (-) Third jump takes away 25 health. This makes triple jumping a lot more risky and punishable if done wrong. You now really have to plan out whether a jump is worth it or not. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Wrap Assassin** (+) Doubled the explosion radius. (+) Shattered baubles still cause bleed. This makes hitting the bauble much easier and you can still cause bleed damage. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ And that's all. I changed every weapon except the pistol, the winger, and the Boston Basher. I'm sure at least one change wasn't good, but someone will tell me that in the comments. "

This is just an OCD thing, as it annoys me the level 3s have 216 health. Isn't really needed, but i wanted to include it. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Dispenser and Teleporter** (+) Increases build time to 15 seconds (6 when boosted). (+) (Dispenser) Increased level 1 healing to 15/sec (20 at 2 and 25 at 3). I decided to make engineer more competitively balanced, it's better to buff his support abilities rather than his sentry. This makes dispensers slightly better and allows you to put them back up faster. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Pomson 6000** (+) Projectile now penetrates enemies. (+) Spies hit with the beam within 512 HUs will blink for .5 seconds longer. (-) Removed cloak and uber drain. This makes it less unfair and more of a pre-MYM bison but on engineer. The cloak thing was just to make up for the loss of cloak drain with a different stat. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Rescue Ranger** (-) Decreased base damage to only 20. (=) Now has reverse fall-off healing (heals 70 hp at max range and only 40 at close). So my actual big problem with the ranger is it is a better pompson damagewise. You can do damage from afar but with a faster projectile. Also the reverse fall-off is so you have incentive to use your wrench up close. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Wrangler** (-) Added a battery meter that drains based on damage taken, fully drains at 500 damage. After it runs out, the sheild disappears but you can still control the sentry. (-) Has a 30 second recharge after holstering before you can get the sheild back. This makes the defensive capabilities of the wrangler quite limited. The wrangler is pretty overpowered in a defensive style of play and limiting it's potential makes it more punishing to use. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Short Circuit** (=) Secondary fire was moved to primary fire. (+) Can now pick up buildings while active. (-).Removed primary fire. (-) -25% metal from dispensers while active. The less metal from dispensers is to reduce spammabilty by just standing on a dispenser. Also the primary fire was removed because it's pretty damn useless. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Southern Hospitality** (+) +20% health and ammo from all sources. (+) Removed -20% fire vulnerability. (-) Added -20% swing speed. This gives it a better upside and a more harsh downside. I'm not entirely sure about this one, but i wanted to make it less boring. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Gunslinger** (-) Mini-sentries have a 20 second cooldown before being able to place another. A small nerf, just makes them less spammable and gets you in that habit of putting them in better spots. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Eureka Effect** (+) When teleporting to spawn, it always puts you in front of the supply locker. Another small chage, just avoids the annoyance of having to walk a bit after teleporting on some maps. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ And that's it. It was quick, but engineer is already pretty balanced. Looking back, i did nerf his weapons quite a bit, though he doesn't really have any underpowered weapons."

But for the slowest class of the game who can't dodge a thing? No way. Here's some rebalances: + (+) Removed damage vulnerability while active + (+) Increased HP gained on kill to +75 + (-) Added: 60% less secondary ammo and 60% slower secondary recharge + (-) Added: -40% ammo from ammo packs and -40% health from health packs (affects lunchbox rechaging) Essentially, it forces Heavy to rely less on his secondary and more on his primary and hopefully melee."

I think it's high time the heavy gets a well deserved buff (there's still going to be nerfs though). ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **All Miniguns** (+) Removed that 1 second damage and accuracy crap. (+) Increased speed when revved up to 51 (33% of heavy's normal speed). (+) Don't have to rev down before switching weapons. The damage and accuracy thing is pretty unnecessary and I'm not too sure why it was added. The speed and weapon switch will definitely help in making heavy a bit faster because slowness is what turns most people off from heavy. I'm not going to make him too fast, just a bit faster. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Natascha** (+) Changes +30% longer spin up time to +20% faster spin up time. (+) Slowed players now receive -20% less healing from all sources. (-) Removed damage resistance while spun up and below 50% health. (-) Increased damage penalty to -30% less. This makes the Natascha actually have a definitive role, support. You do much less damage but can quickly slow down fleeing opponents or attackers. It might need a new downside, but I'd say it's pretty balanced. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Brass Beast** (+) Increased damage bonus to +25%. (+) Added +50% knockback resistance while spun up. (+) Reduced slowdown while spun up to -50%. (-) Removed damage resistance while spun up. (-) Added +100% increase in deploy and holster time. (-) Have to rev down to switch weapons. So this lessens up the penalties a little while allowing you to do slightly more damage and not be knocked around. To compensate you don't have resistance and you pull it out incredibly slowly. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Huo-Long Heater** (+) Changed -10% damage penalty to -10% damage penalty to non-burning players. (+) Reduced ammo drain to 3 per second. (+) Fire ring now extinguishes friendly players. (-) Reduced fire ring damage to 6. Now i actually do think that this weapon is alright as is, but it could use some slight tweaking. Now it does a full 25% more to burning players, doesn't destroy your ammo as much, and has a supportive use. The changes aren't giant, but they help. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **All Lunchbox Items** (+) +20% recharge rate when shared with a friend. This just kind of makes sense, considering it's what the milk and jarate does. Plus it makes selfish heavies more willing to share. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Sandvich** (-) Increased recharge to 45 seconds. So i didn't want to straight up nerf the sandvich, but i thought it would be best. It's not the worst nerf it could get, but it helps the other items a lot. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Dalokohs Bar** (+) +40% faster taunt speed. (-) Increased recharge to 15 seconds. This makes it better for healing yourself because you get health back quick and it refills 3 times faster than the sandvich. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Buffalo Steak Sandvich** (+) Refills 50 health on use. That's it. With a change I'll get to later, it'll be pretty balanced, plus this small change makes it slightly better to use on low health. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **All Melees** (+) Increased base damage to 80. Since heavy is so slow, it is risky and not that smart to go running at someone with fists out. It is only really good for if you have no shotgun and you need instant close range damage. This makes melee damage slightly better since you can two shot 150 hp classes. It also indirectly buffs the steak. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Gloves of Running Urgently** *New Design:* (+) Press alt-fire to charge forward at 200% speed for 3 seconds. (-) Charge is on a meter that empties on charge and takes 30 seconds to refill. (-) Marked for Death for 5 seconds after charging. (-) -50% damage penalty. (-) -70% holster time. This allows for a more gimmicky weapon but one that will be good for rollouts and escape. You can't just charge and do 80 damage, plus you are vulnerable afterwards, making it not for damage like for demoknight. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Warriors Spirit** (+) Added crits when it would normally mini-crit. (-) Reduced damage bonus to +15%. (-) Added no random crits. This gives it good pairing with the steak but because of the melee increase and the crits, the damage was dropped. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Eviction Notice** (-) Added -50% holster speed. (-) Increased vulnerability to 25%. This makes it a bit more penalizing than before. It also isn't a GRU ripoff with the change made to it. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ And that's all. Overall a big buff chain for our sandwich loving Russian, but a few nerfs on the weapons that needed them. I'm not too keen about some of the changes, but that's what feedback is for."
416,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,"[UP] ""Sharpened Volcano Fragment"" &lt;Pyro Melee&gt;",2,760ca1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/760ca1/up_sharpened_volcano_fragment_pyro_melee/,2017-10-13 08:55:10,"I think I've posted some tweaks for this weapon in the past, but if I haven't then here are some reworks for this complete load of trash: **Sharpened Volcano Fragment V1** *Level X Fire Axe* ~~**Infernal heat: While active, all afterburn deals double damage**~~ ~~*While active: +10% damage vulnerability*~~ Set your foes alight, step back, draw the SVF and watch them take double damage, which for standard fire damage equals 6 damage/tick (12/second, for 120 total damage). The downside is that you take a bit more damage from everything while the weapon is drawn, so you have to check your surroundings before you switch to it. Not a very inspiring downside, but that's what I've put for now and it could be changed to something else. Here's a second alternative: **Sharpened Volcano Fragment V2** *Level X Fire Axe* ~~**On kill: Collect souls, each soul increases your fire damage by 10%**~~ ~~**+25% damage bonus**~~ ~~*-20% fire damage*~~ ~~*While active: +10% damage vulnerability*~~ Start with lower fire damage (flamethrower direct damage and all afterburn damage), kill enemies with the SVF, increase your fire damage gradually (up to 7 kills for +50% fire damage). Also has a damage bonus to help with melee kills and not make soul collecting a difficult chore (which I think having the default 65 damage/hit would do). I used the same downside as above as it seemed fitting here too, since you now have to be careful when approaching enemy players for melee kills; your targets may be at a distance and will likely have a ranged weapon , and since you'll need to get close to them they'll be at an advantage."
417,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,(OP) Banned In Competitive,6,76eb9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/76eb9e/op_banned_in_competitive/,2017-10-15 06:48:42,"So if you know anything about competitive, you'll know that some weapons are banned. I'm going to attempt to try and fix the weapons to make them unbanned. I'm going to go off the global whitelist in 6v6, maybe I'll do others someday. Grab your popcorn because this'll be a long one. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Soda Popper** *Ban Reason: Very hard to hit scouts with projectiles when they are under the effects of the Hype.* (=) Hype effect now grants 50% more jump height and immunity to knockback or flinching. (+) Reduced damage needed to fill to 300. So the new design will have a good mobility purpose and give you some advantages against projectile classes. The thing is that you can now be hit, but the hit isn't as devastating as you don't go flying. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Bonk!** *Ban Reason: Gives incredible flanking potential and the ability to distract sentry guns with no real downside.* (+) Now has a 30% knockback resistance when under effects. (-) You are marked for death after use based on damage taken. (1 second for no damage to 5 seconds for 200+ damage.) So this punishes you for bad positioning when it ends but you don't get knocked around as much. It also gives a reason to start attacking the scout who is under the effects. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Crit-A-Cola** *Ban Reason: Gives a big power increase and speed boost for very small downsides.* (-) Reduced speed boost to only +10%. (-) Increased vulnerability to 25%. So this is one of the only ones that i straight up nerf with no new upsides, but i think it is needed. You don't run as fast and the downside is actually penalizing because you can be one shot by grenades. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Flying Guillotine** *Ban Reason: Criting on stunned players is largely unfair and can one shot enemies with little effort. (+) Now mini-crits on bleeding targets. (+) Increased base damage to 75. (+) Travels 50% faster. (-) No longer causes bleed. (-) No longer crits stunned players. (-) No longer mini-crits at long range. So i changed quite a lot, but in the end i got rid of the annoying combo for a new combo. It now pairs well with the wrap assassin and will do slightly over 100 damage on mini-crit. It also the fastest projectile in the game at 4,500 HU/s now. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Mad Milk** *Ban Reason: Allows for a huge team advantage if thrown into a crowded area.* (+) 20% of damage done to milked enemies will return to the scout. (+) Extinguishing teammates will give them afterburn immunity for 8 seconds. (-) Reduced health back on hitting milked players to 30%. So i kind of took this idea from another balance thing, but no matter. It makes your team much less powerful against milked enemies but makes it so only you have the big advantage. It also makes it a stronger pyro counter, but not the hugest buff. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Atomizer** *Ban Reason: Allows for an unpredictable third jump to counter soldier and demo with little downside.* (+) No longer takes 10 health to triple jump. (-) Triple jump only takes effect when weapon is out. (-) Added -50% deploy speed. So this makes it more predictable in the third jump and you can't just quickly pull it out to triple jump and then holster it. The jump is less risky because you don't lose health though. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Sandman** *Ban Reason: Stun ain't fun.* (+) Now reduces jump height of stunned players by 50%. (-) Stun no longer removes the ability to fire your weapons. So this is essentially what valve changed, but it's a decent idea. You can still cripple someone with slow speed and barely any jump, but it's not annoying to fight against. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Reserve Shooter** *Ban Reason: For pyro, it allows for an easy increase in damage for minimal downside.* (+) On Hit: Airborne targets are stunned for .1 seconds. (+) +30% more accurate (-) Mini-crits on airborne targets only applies when the target is below 50% health. (-) -20% damage penalty on non-airborne targets. (-) -30% damage penalty on burning entered enemies. So this was the hardest balance idea i had to do. It's almost impossible to balance the reserve shooter for both classes and have it be good. I'm not even sure about this idea, but i tried. The 50% health thing isn't that bad on soldier because launched targets will have lost health anyway. It also now has a worse downside on the ground. The penalty on burning makes it hard for pyro to get those mini-crits, as burning them pretty much counters it. The more accurate is to help deny jumping soldiers better. The best change for soldier is the small stun, as it completely messes up a scouts jump and denies rocket jumpers better. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **B.A.S.E. Jumper** *Ban Reason: Blocks fall damage and can make hitting falling players harder due to being able to fall slightly then redeploy.* (+) Wearer takes 30% less fall damage after undeploying. (-) Cannot redeploy after undeploying until hitting the ground (are these even words?). So this also something valve is kind of doing, but i made it slightly better. Now you aren't wasting a slot if you need to quickly dodge a shot while floating down. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Disciplinary Action** *Ban Reason: Melee damage is rarely needed so it is mostly a straight upgrade.* (-) Has a 50% increased deploy and holster time. This makes it not a straight upgrade and is a bit more risky to take out and put away. It also fits with the longer range it has. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Gloves of Ruining Urgently** *Ban Reason: Has great rollout use with very miniscule downsides.* (+) Max speed increased to going 110% speed. (-) Replaced speed boost with speed increase based on health (like the EP). This makes it better for escape and not for rollouts. The good thing is you can now go faster than a medic at low health, making it much better for getting out fast. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Fists of Steel** *Ban Reason: When paired with a medic, you can be incredibly resistant to all damage and survive headshots without a medic.* (+) Increased resistance to 50% (-) -75% overheal reduction while active. (-) -15% critical hit vulnerability. So now you can't survive a fully charged headshot and aren't pretty much invincible while the weapon is active and you have a medic. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Rescue Ranger** *Ban Reason: Can easily tank your sentry without needing to get in danger.* (=) Now has reverse fall-off healing (40 hp when up close to 70 from afar). This just makes it so you can't tank your sentry that well but can still use it to heal your sentry from far away. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Wrangler** *Ban Reason: Can tank your sentry incredibly easily and deal out amazing damage from any range for pretty much no downside.* (+) No longer has a 3 second deactivation after holstering. (-) The sheild will deactivate after the gun takes 150 damage (450 if you add the resist) and will take 30 seconds to reactivate after holstering. (-) Reduced firing speed when wrangled to 1.5x more. This makes it have less firing speed and it now has a limit to it's defensive capabilities. This makes a decent Ubercharge enough to take out the sheild. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Short Circuit** *Ban Reason: Can completely shut down a spamming projectile class and can fire infinitely when on a dispenser.* (=) Now has an ammo pool instead of using metal. Has 20 shots for primary and 5 shots for secondary. (+) Reloads entire clip at once. (-) Takes 2.5 seconds to reload secondary and 1 second to reload primary. This makes it much less spammable and you can't just shut down a spamming projectile class as much. You now have 5 shots before a long reload and you have to make the best of them. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Quick-Fix** *Ban Reason: Has a load of upsides for a small downside that is sort of countered by the upside.* (-) Ubercharge rate decreased on overhealed patients. (-) Removed incresed uber rate. This just makes getting Ubercharge harder. Currently the fix has no uber penalty on overhealed patients, so that change sort of makes sense. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Solemn Vow** *Ban Reason: The downside is pretty much irrelevant, making it a basic straight upgrade.* (+) Removed swing speed penalty. (-) While Active: Enemies can see your health. This just makes it have a more punishing downside that doesn't destroy the weapon. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Vita-saw** *Ban Reason: Allows for retaining of Ubercharge, which is unfair i guess.* (+) On Death: Gain back the Ubercharge you had 25% faster. (+) Removed health penalty. (-) Removed uber retained on death. (-) Ubercharge after what you died with builds 25% slower. This makes it good for if you died at high Ubercharge but bad if you die at low charge. Basically your life is easier to start but worse after where you left off. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Sydney Sleeper** *Ban Reason: Can deal bodyshot damage quicker and pretty much make anyone have a huge disadvantage.* (-) Removed the increased charge speed and added -10% charge speed. This just makes getting full charge bodyshots harder to get, nothing too bad, but still makes it worse. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Darwin's Danger Sheild** *Ban Reason: Allows you to dominate in Sniper v Sniper for a small downside.* (+) Removed explosive vulnerability. (-) Removed bullet resistance. This just makes it a decent sheild that gives you extra health but you can't survive a quickscope. Now it will be used for extra health for medic pairing and going huntsman without being able to win against snipers. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Jarate** *Ban Reason: Can greatly turn the tide of a fight for your team with one throw in a crowded area.* (=) Enemies coated in jarate don't take mini-crits but are slowed down by 35% and have a 50% healing penalty until it wears off. This makes it turn the tide of a fight, but not as much as before. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ It's finally over! Now even i am a tiny bit sceptical on some of these, but most I'd need to see in game to test the balance. I did skip a few banned ones just because i couldn't nerf them (like the Steak)."

Baby Face's Blaster: This has been nerfed to the 9th circle of hell. I understand why but they went a bit too far. (+) Now takes 100 damage to remove the boost instead of 25. (+) Boost lost on double jump changed from 75% to 50%. This basically allows you to actually keep the boost for more than 12 seconds when a stray bullet hits you and you become slower than a crippled snail. Back Scatter: Unlike the bfb, this weapon was always pretty shit. It's not as bad as people think, but it's mostly a straight downgrade. (+) Removed -20% accuracy. (+) Removed clip size penalty. (-) Added -30% damage penalty on non-back shots. This gives it simple stats which aren't contradictory. It gives incentive to be a flank scout and punishes not doing it right. Pretty Boy's Pocket Shithole: The new balance idea valve has is pretty good, but I have another approach. (I will just put my new stats for it instead of all changes, k mate?) (+) 5 health on hit. (+) 15% firing speed. (-) 20% damage penalty. (-) 25% slower reload speed. This just allows for quick heals at cost of damage. The reload speed is just so you can't heal too fast after you empty your clip. Crit-Ebola: Ah the crit a frickin cola. Everyone hates you, so let's fix that, shall we? (+) Removed 10% damage vulnerability. (-) Added Marked for Death while under it's effects. Simple fix, just give it some love of it's old design. You give crits, ya get crits. Basic shit. Flying Guillotine: I do kinda hate the sandman combo but I wouldn't want to see it go, just nerfed. (-) Removed crits on stunned players. (+) Added +75% damage against stunned players. (-) Increased reload time from 11 seconds to 15 seconds. (+) Added +30% damage. This nerfs the combo but still makes it viable and doable. Also I made it slightly better as a standalone weapon. Atomizer: This can be pretty can good for dodging projectiles in competitive. It's not overly overpowered but I'll tweak it slightly. (+) Removed damage on triple jump. (-) Added Marked for Death for 2 seconds on triple jump. Basically just makes you more vulnerable after a jump and a good airshotting soldier can easily take you out after the jump. Sandman: You get it. (-) Remove the movement speed penalty on stunned players. (-) The ball is now a ten health object that disintegrates after taking 10 damage. This makes the clever combo harder but also makes aware players be able to counter being stunned. Sun on a Shit: This is just so bad, what else do I have to say. I have two designs for it because design 1 might be hard to implement. Design 1: (+) Added alt-fire launches fireball that does 30 damage and lights people on fire. (-) Fireball has a 10 second reload time. This one allows for you to make use of the crit thing, and make a new gimmicky combo for scout. Design 2: (+) Added second successful hit lights people on fire. This one is more simple and gives that 3 hit combo of the gunslinger to scout, as well as being pretty easy to implement in (I would think). Wrap Assassin: This just sucks. It's a fine idea, just not handled well. (+) Added 200% max secondary ammo. (+) Added +30% blast radius. (+) Added +50 blast damage. (-) Added +40% reload time. This allows the ball to be a good damage dealer and you can miss but still do some damage. You can use the 3 ammo strategically or just spam them into a choke point like the douchebag you are. So that's my idea for balance changes. I guess just tell me if I missed a weapon or tell me how homosexual I am because my changes suck."

Anyway... here are my ideas for sniper balance. **As A Class:** There is really only one thing that I want to change as a class. (+) Changed speed when scoped from 27% to 40%. This makes him just slightly faster when scoped to peek around corners. It's not the most pressing issue but it helps. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **All Sniper Rifles:** There is two things I hate about sniper are quickscopes and quickscopes. It annoys me a sniper can effortlessly one shot half the classes. He should at least have to wait a bit. (-) No headshots until after scoping for .3 seconds. This gets rid of those nasty quickscopes and adds slightly more planning to sniper. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Sydney Sleeper:** This weapon is a just a bit too good. No headshots is still a pretty nasty penalty, but this thing is banned in comp for a reason. (-) Removed +25% faster charge speed. This is not the biggest change, it's just a bit harder to get those 150 damage shots. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Bazaar Bargain:** This weapon quickly becomes a straight upgrade after only 3 headshots. It needs a bit more work for that charge. (-) Changed 50% charge penalty to 100% charge penalty. This makes it a bit more of an uphill climb to get that quick charge greatness. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Classic:** This weapon is pretty bad. You can charge while unscoped, but not being able to headshot is very limiting. (+) Added mini-crits on headshot when not at full charge. This gives you some insentive to actually headshot when not fully charged. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Machina:** This weapon is known as the bodyshot weapon for a reason. It's best to change that annoying upside with something a bit more useful. (-) Removed increased damage when fully charged. (+) Added +40% damage to buildings. This makes it more worthwhile for taking out a sentry nest and not the ""bodyshot weapon"". ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Razorback:** Blah blah (+) Added a 30 second recharge on the weapon. This now makes it so you don't have to run back to a supply locker when you get stabbed. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Darwin's Danger Shield:** This weapon is overpowered against other snipers as it requires both of them to have it for it to be fair. (+) Removed 20% Explosion vulnerability. (-) Added -15% critical hit vulnerability. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Cleaners Carbine:** Do i have to keep doing these? No? Ok (-) Removed the Crikey meter. (+) Added 5 seconds of crit boost on kill. The full crits for 5 seconds can make it more viable as a good damage dealer compared to the smg. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Tribalmans Shiv:** Doesn't do enough damage. (+) Changed -50% damage penalty to -30% damage penalty. Does enough damage. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Shahanshah: This weapon is similar to the equalizer in how it isn't that useful. So I'll fix it like equalizer. (+) Added +50% health on kill. This gives you actual insentive to run at someone at very low health. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ This was a bit lower quality that normal, but no matter. "

(+) +20% Speed on wearer. (+) +50 Health on wearer. (-) +20% knockback vulnerability *on wearer*. This is more just to pair with the shotgun. Pretty simple, just big buffs but it replaces your best form of damage. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Rampaging Russian:** *Level X Shotgun* (+) On hit: Build ""Rampage"" meter. Takes 500 to fill and lasts for 10 seconds. (+) Rampage removes all clip and ammo for the duration. (+) +20% damage. (-) -34% clip size. (-) -20% reload speed. This is an idea that was meant to serve as something that can be used for scouting and heavying.

Today I will try to balance the man, and maybe people will main him (Probably not). ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **All Miniguns:** So heavy is not played for two main reasons. He's very slow and had a low skill ceiling, which I will try to fix slightly. (+) Don't have to wait to rev up to switch weapons. (+) Can now destroy projectiles with the Minigun. This will not only speed him up a bit, but will give him a good ability to raise the skill ceiling a bit higher. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Natascha:** This weapon really seems like valve doesn't know what they want with this weapon. So I want to make it a good ambush weapon. (-) Removed damage resistance when spun up. (-) Added -25% max ammo. (+) Speed lost from a range has been increased slightly. (+) Added +15% faster spin up time. That makes it a more clear ambush tool to be slightly more supportive and stop people from escaping. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Brass Beast:** This weapon is a bit underwhelming for its negatives being so harsh. It needs a decent buff. (+) +20% damage increased to +30% damage. (+) +20% resistance while spun up applies while at any increment of health. (-) Spin speed penalty is now -60%. This is a bit more useful for dealing and tanking damage, but a bit slower. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Huolong Heater:** Now I want to give this weapon a total revamp, so here it is. (+) Shoots out fireworks that light people on fire and explode on hit. (+) Fireworks do +10% damage. (-) Projectiles are not hitscan and can be reflected. (-) -30% firing speed. (-) -20% move speed when revved and -30% when firing. This was an idea I've wanted to see done with this, but it's just a fire ring. It would be much more unique like this. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **All Lunchbox Items:** This is an idea I've had for a while so here it is, finally. (+) Recharge speed increased by 20% when shared with a friend. This just makes it a bit less damaging to yourself when shared. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Dalokhos Bar:** This weapon is fine as is, but I'd like a small change. (+) +40% faster taunt speed. (-) Recharge time increased to 15 seconds. I always thought faster taunt speed makes a lot of sense if you heal less. And the recharge to counteract the two buffs. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Buffalo Steak Sandwich:** This weapon really doesn't work to well considering you get rid of a 500 dps weapon for 90 damage melee hits, not to good. (+) Changed the mini-crit boost to a full crit boost. (-) Removed the speed boost. This makes it pack a bit more punch and be quite useful for dealing damage. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Panic Attack:** This weapon isn't that good, it is hard to use for escape as you have to load 4 shots before firing. (+) Loaded shots can be stored when the weapon is deployed. (-) Auto-fires clip when deployed. This can allow for quick burst damage when at low health, finally making it's name fit well. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Warriors Spirit:** This weapon is a bit too bad with the vulnerability debuff, you know the drill. (+) Removed the 30% damage vulnerability. (-) Added honorbound system. (-) Decreased damage bonus to 25% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Eviction Notice:** This weapon has just become a weaker GRU, i want to see it become something original. (-) Remove +15% speed on wearer. (+) Damage penalty decreased to -40%. (-) Removed speed boost on hit. (+) Added on kill: +20% speed boost for 10 seconds.

Bam, we got a market gardening pyro, kind of. I felt this idea would make it a bit more unique compared to the other flare guns. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Manmelter:** This weapon has a cool idea, but needs a slight change to make it better. (+) Added On Extinguish: gain a 5 second speed boost. (+) Added Gain 1 ""replenish"" on extinguish. Extinguish will completely refill your health and put you into overheal. Can only be used while out. (+) Added +15% deploy speed. (-) Removed crits on extinguish. (-) Removed 20 health on extinguish. (-) Decreased projectile speed to +20% speed. Now it's more unique (like the detonator). Crits are cool but this could be quite interesting. It may need testing to see if it's balanced. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Axtinguisher:** I have a small and simple idea to make the downside less bad. (+) Removed -75% deploy speed. (-) Added -75% holster speed. Now it's back to a good finisher weapon but it is now more risky to take out. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Powerjack:** This weapon is pretty good, and it's pretty much the meta weapon right now. I want to change it slightly. (+) Added On Kill: gain a 10% speed boost for 5 seconds. (-) Removed health on kill. (-) Changed -20% damage vulnerability to marked for death while active. Now i removed that random health on kill to a more fitting upside. Also it is now more risky to have it out. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Homewrecker:** Nothing much to change, just a simple little idea i had. (+) Heals friendly buildings on hit. (-) Increased damage penalty to -30%. This could be interesting. Now you can just go battle Engie and let pyro take care of your stuff! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Third Degree:** This weapon is just a pointless straight upgrade and needs a completely new design. (+) All players connected by a medi-gun are hit. (+) Puts enemy overheal into yourself, maxes out at normal pyro overheal max. (-) -30% swing speed. (-) -40% holster speed. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Sharpened Volcano Fragment:** Ok this weapon just sucks, needs a rework to be good, yadda yadda. (+) Added On Hit: Marks enemy for death. (+) +20% swing speed. (-) Damage penalty increased to -40%. Woo-Hoo, now you have a reason to use this over just burning them with the flamethrower. Not only can you do extra damage, the enemy takes *mini-crit afterburn*. Now it's useful. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Well that's all, changed quite a bit but now pyro might be better.

The current one is just an overpowered ambassador. **Cozy Camper** ~~**No flinching**~~ ~~**+5 health per second when scoped and standing still**~~ This was a great idea, but even then it was bad to begin with. **Cleaner's Carbine** ~~**+30% damage bonus when not moving or crouching**~~ ~~*-30% damage penalty otherwise*~~ I didn't really think the previous playstyle would ever work. **Holy Mackeral** ~~**Getting hit by a fish has got to be humiliating**~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ No comment. **Machina** ~~**Bullets penetrate several enemies depending the charge. 100% charge pierces infinitely.**~~ ~~**No longer makes that really loud sound when you get a penetration kill**~~ ~~*15% slower reload speed*~~ It was just way too useless.

Sadly, its too similar too the Neon Annihilator, so that's subject to change eventually, Tell me what you think, might not be the most well received Thing i've posted here, so i'm sorry if this sucks."

Axtingisher: I look at the current version and just think, thats too many Downsides, So i got rid of All of them (Aside from No Random Critical Hits) and added two new ones, Which i hopefully think makes it balanced, I was never there for The Puff and Sting Combo at its highest, and thank god. But the way this weapon is today........Just No.... Powerjack: I decided to make this Weapon Purely Utility by making it swing much slower, its a giant car battery, i did however, make it so you do get more health on kill, so theres that. Back Scratcher: Because this thing is somewhat a straight upgrade in competitive Because it helps medic build Uber Much Faster. So now it can't, at all. i was originally just gonna have it be so Healers couldn't heal you period, but that seemed a little to harsh. SVF: I've noticed that almost everyone (Me included) here has tried to make thing a damage dealer, Or a broken ""Free Crit"" Weapon, so i thought what would make it a Utility Weapon? Well, what if the Weapon is so Hot, that is gives the Pyro a Damage Resistance? Why not? At least its more unique. Third Degree: I had too much fun coming up with a Complete rework with this one, While it still kinda falls into the Category of being mostly useless if either Team doesn't have a Medic, its you're still gonna get a lot more health for Carts and Dispensers. Might of went overboard with this one... Neon:the Ability to never be inflicted with a Debuffs is strangely powerful, This includes: Bleed, Afterburn, Jarate, Milk, Marked For Death, Slow Down (From Weapons), and Stun. Making it more Unique in all of Pyros Weapons. So, That's it, all Six of them (Mins the HW because its fine as is) I went for it, Gave them all Unique upsides and Downsides and tried my hardest. I really want feedback on this one, So don't be afraid to comment or Dislike. This took three hours but i hope i could share my Insight. "

So now if you want those kills for the Health and Speed, You need to use it to finish off someone (Or Use The Shield Crit, but i tried to build as these so they could be used for both Standard and Knight) Like a Regular Melee. Nessie's Nine Iron: I'm in the mind set that Reskins in the drop system is kinda unfair, especially to new players, with only one day a week, And you can only get 6-7 weapons out of near 132. Its kinda stupid, So why not keep a similar idea but change it up a bit. Rather than Health and Durability, You get Speed and Damage, But now only have 150 Health. This one is probably better with Knight than Standard though, so i failed in the regard. The Pain Train: Utility Overhaul, Now it makes capping easier, and No Fall Damage, but its does only 30-ish damage and You take more damage from Explosives And Bullets and all of it is Active with just having the Weapon equipped. Honestly on Demoman it would probably just be used for Sticky Jumping, So it might be more useful on Solly. The Scotsman Skullcutter: If the Axe is so heavy that is slows Demoman Down, why can he swing just as fine as a Bottle? This is more of a Logic thing than anything, But it is currently the best Demo Melee, So knocking it down a slight peg shouldn't hurt too much. The Claidheamh Mr: This is probably the Weapon along with the Bison that got unnecessarily nerfed, The current version is outclassed, by both the Zato and Persuader, So i gave it back its one unique stat. This is the one sword that REQUIRES a shield sadly, So either Hybrid Knight or Full Knight. So it probably had little comp value sadly. The Ullapool Caber: Easily tied with The Loch n Load for my most hated weapon in the game. So i completely reworked it, Now every hit is an 80 Damage Explosion that will damage everyone in the vicinity, And will allow you to explosive Jump with out wasting ammo, Might be Overpowered, But going from one of the worst weapons in the game to one of these best isn't the worst thing. The Half-Zatoichi: This is the one sword that probably gave me the most trouble with coming up changes with, So now if you Sheath it.....you're also marked for death.......? I don't really know...... The Persian Persuader: I.......Really don't get the point of the current version of this weapon, No downsides as a Pure Demoknight, but honestly, I really like the concept of Ammo Kits getting turned into health, So i added that back while also added two new upsides for basic demoman, Its still mostly the normal persuader of you go full Demoknight, But its still useful With the regular Demoman. Good fucking god, this took me forever, But i did it. At this point, i'm not sure if i'll do any other classes melee weapons but i may. Honestly i'm not sure if anyone is gonna like this, this may get dislikes, Pyro melees did, So I'll see what the Feedback is."

It would also now apply to airblast knockback as well. * While the '3x fall damage to enemy players you land on' effect can be a fun one, it is too weak a stat to be an effective upside on its own. I would rather not get rid of it however; instead, I'd rather make it a generic trait of the Heavy and all footwear items (Bootlegger, Ali Baba's Wee Booties, Gunboats and Mantreads) or simply a basic mechanic all classes can technically make use of. * While the TF Team has suggested their own buff for the Mantreads (increased turning control when rocket jumping), I'm not a fan of it being on the Mantreads, since it would mean the Mantreads are simply another jumping weapon through and through, instead of having more of their own role that isn't shared by the Gunboats to an extent. This is not me saying it would be a bad change however. The Mantreads are an often overlooked weapon for the Soldier. Though useful for staying on objectives, pushing sentries with a Medic, and preventing your jumps from being disrupted, they are still rather weak compared to the extra mobility granted by the Gunboats, the self-defense potential of the shotguns, and the buffs of the banners. Such is why I'd like to rework them to be a defensive counterpart to the Gunboats. With the increased health and movement speed, the Soldier is less reliant on rocket jumping to navigate the map and will have an easier time reaching the front lines and dealing damage there, while the knockback resistance will continue to make the Soldier far more difficult to remove from objectives and otherwise knock around. However, the knockback will also restrict the Soldier's rocket jumping by reducing the amount of knockback rocket jumps deal to the wearer, forcing him to more heavily rely on his standard movement to get around. --- **Gunboats** ~~**80% less self-damage from rocket jumps**~~ ~~**+200% air control**~~ ~~*-40 less max health on wearer*~~ =Notes: * The self-damage resistance to rocket jumps will now apply even if your rocket damages an enemy. * The increased air control is similar to the Demo shields' turning control - you will effectively be able to turn more sharply, both when blast jumping and when surfing knockback from enemy damage. In contrast to the Mantreads, the Gunboats are an arguably overused and/or overpowered weapon for the Soldier, as the grant him a great deal more potential mobility (due to the reduced health cost of rocket jumps) at little cost (in pubs at least, where the lack of a shotgun is not as potent or crippling). These changes attempt to preserve the Gunboats focus on low cost bursts of mobility and even enhance it (using the TF Team's suggested idea for buffing the Mantreads), and then meet it with an inherent downside: the reduced max health. While this might seem counterproductive, the reason for reducing the max health is to prevent the Soldier from being too durable while being mobile. The rocket launcher he is ferrying is a powerful weapon, and letting the Soldier be durable and mobile while carrying it makes him a bit too difficult/frustrating of a target to take out. Reducing the max health keeps the Soldier at a constant state of vulnerability compared to a normal Soldier, while the increased (back to the original levels actually) rocket jump resistance means rocket jumps are nearly free for the Soldier, balancing out the nerf and the weapon on the whole. --- Please let me know your thoughts below."

Not having a lot of faith in the coming update going by this. Still, there is some good/interesting ideas floating about (though still plenty bad). --- =Interesting: * Crit-a-Cola marking you for death for 5 seconds with every attack is interesting, as is them getting rid of the speed boost and damage vulnerability. It would mean the Scout is more vulnerable once he starts attacking, but the player has control over when the vulnerability kicks in. And better yet, no more speedy scouts! * Minigun may be getting its damage nerf rolled back just enough (damage penalty is removed by spin-up, not constant firing). * Comp may rejoice as the DDS is made anti-pyro instead of anti-sniper. Not sure I entirely like the change (seems like it'd be more useless for Sniper due to the lack of Pyros reaching him), but I could be wrong. Pyro still won't be hampered too much at least. And then their is the Razorback of course. Good changes? Maybe; regeneration has been a long time coming at least. * Atomizer must be active for the third jump, so it seems it's more limited to being a mobility tool rather than a dodging tool now. Not that bad; still, it might be too much as well. (I'd still say making some sort of swap between the Atomizer and Winger would be the best bet). Also, mini-crits while air jumping? Interesting... * Rescue Ranger: Yes, nerf the battle engi, the ninjaneer. Nerrrrrf theeeeeem (however minor it might be, it is nice to see some downside to ranged repair). --- =My Dislikes: * As much as I hate the Ambassador, taking away its accuracy permanently in order to restrict its range seems a bit much for me. No other non-minigun bullet weapon suffers that, and at this point it would be dwarfed by the power of a backstab I'd imagine. * PBPP seems it may be becoming an upgraded stock. More health regen and a faster firing speed just for a slightly smaller clip, on a weapon not used for fighting but finishing (as the damage vulnerability and fall immunity may be removed)? It seems too useful compared to stock. * Bonk...just...maybe? It seems too extreme a downside. The point is to use it to avoid damage, but it punishes you for using it to avoid damage. It sounds self-defeating. * BASE Jumper could probably use some sort of upsides alongside the nerfing. Nothing too major - maybe increased ammo capacity for the rocket launcher or some sort of damage resistance while parachuting? You'd be a rather easy target with the nerfs, so some extra staying power seems fair. * Vita-Saw...HAS THE SAME FREAKING PROBLEM, JUST EXAGGERATED AND EVEN MORE COUNTER INTUITIVE!

What if there was a secondary for heavy that was a football he held, abd he could use right click to activate an effect that would eject him into third person, and then he would start charging forward and become immune to knockback effects? There would be a brief activation period, where perhaps a coach whistle sound effect would play and he arch back for a second before charging forward for a duration. Perhaps, alongside the knockback immunity, he would recieve about a 30% movement speed increase. There probably wouldnt be a damage resistance, as that would be frustrating to deal with, but a damage vulnerability to make him easier to kill while charging forward would probably negate he whole purpose of the weapon, unless it was miniscule. The charge effect could only be used when a resource meter was filled, perhaps by time duration like the sandvich or by dealing damage like the MVM special abilite for heavy. I cant balance this on paper, but anyways, thanks for reading. It was just an idea that popped into my head and i thought i might share it on reddit.:)"

So far, only 5 weapons utilize bleed: * Boston Basher (Scout) * Wrap Assassin (Scout) * Flying Guillotine (Scout) * Tribalman's Shiv (Sniper) * Southern Hospitality (Engineer) This effect currently lasts for 5 seconds (6 on the Tribalman's Shiv), dealing 4 damage per tick. It can't be cured as easily as afterburn, but deals less overall damage in comparison (3 damage per tick for 10 seconds). Also like afterburn, it can be used to track spies, though it is arguably less effective since it causes a periodic blood spurt rather than a constant tint or graphic (ie: being on fire). So, what about changing it to a soak effect? The effects could be as follows: * Duration: 5 seconds (no more unique Tribalman's duration) * Effect: 20% damage vulnerability * Effect: Bleeding players have a blood droplet icon on their HUD * Effect: Bleeding players are tinted red and have droplets of blood constantly falling off them. * No more damage over time --- How do you think a change like this might be able to affect the game?

Cannot attack during this time. for 8 seconds**~~ ~~*After use, halves users base speed to 200 HU/s and takes mini-crits for 8 seconds.*~~ &amp;nbsp; * The current Bonk gives the Scout the ability distracting a sentry gun from the rest of your team when you wish to try to attack a point without uber and is basically a ""Get out of jail free card"" without really any effort or cost in the Scouts part. * And the current version is also a really good weapon for flanking because if people choose to ignore the Flanking Scout they will be either killed or get backcapped and if they choose to chase the Scout they will be forced to leave the place they are defending and the team loses some of their firepower and are forced to play more passively. &amp;nbsp; **Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Up to +10 Health Regenertion, ability is passive**~~ ~~*-60% Clip size*~~ ~~*-16 Max Secondary Ammo*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Changed from being incredibly useless to an actual utility weapon that's focused on more health recovery in exchange for less damage. &amp;nbsp; **Mad Milk** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Changed ""heal 60% of the damage done"" to ""Restores 100% of base health upon killing an enemy. Health restored above maximum is transferred to overheal"". Players assisted in killing also gain the health.**~~ ~~*Replaced the cooldown with buildup by picking up Health Packs to refill the Mad Milk. 50%/25%/10% for Full/Med/Small Health Packs respectively*~~ &amp;nbsp; * If you've ever fought a Black Box Soldier buffed with the Concherer then you know how nigh impossible they are to kill and in my opinion the whole concept of ""Healing on hit"" is not really fair to play against because players can easily get bunched together and because of the healing which it allows give a significant advantage over your opponent so to give other classes a balanced chance to be able kill these ""Healing on hit"" users is to change it to a ""Healing on kill"" so they are actually deserving of the health. * Also now it will only heal players who killed and assisted in getting the kill. Meaning now in competitive it won't drive the entire team to retreat until the effects wear off because it won't automatically insure the kill. &amp;nbsp; **Flying Guillotine/Sandman** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Sandman: Changed ""Alt-Fire: Launches a ball that stuns opponents"" to ""Alt-Fire: Launches a ball that marks opponents for death for up to 15 seconds depending on distance user is to the target.""**~~ ~~**Flying Guillotine: Changed ""100% critical hit vs stunned players"" to ""Crits whenever it would normally mini-crit**~~ ~~*Replaced the cooldown with buildup by picking up Ammo Packs to refill the Cleaver/Balls. 50%/25%/10% for Full/Med/Small Ammo Packs respectively*~~ &amp;nbsp; **Atomizer** &amp;nbsp; ~~Changed ""Grants Triple Jump: The third jump deals 10 damage when used"" to ""Grants Infinite Air Jumps: Every air-jump will cost the user 30% of the users current health, Every air-jump includes the stock double jump~~ &amp;nbsp; * Made it so the Atomizer now actually hits ""damage taken threshold"" meaning Scouts can get 1-shot if they are not careful. &amp;nbsp; **Wrap Assassin** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Increased bleed duration from 5 to up to 15 seconds based on distance from user.**~~ ~~*Replaced the cooldown with buildup by picking up Ammo Packs to refill the Balls. 50%/25%/10% for Full/Med/Small Ammo Packs respectively*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Made it more rewarding for hitting the ornaments directly. &amp;nbsp; **Candy Cane** &amp;nbsp; ~~**On kill(With any weapon) : A small health pack is dropped**~~ ~~**+100% healing from Pickups and Dispensers**~~ ~~*-90% Healing from Mediguns*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Current(Valve) stats summary : ""You die faster but on kill you heal yourself"". Not the greatest tradeoff. * I've given it the ""Backscratcher"" treatment to give the Scout more of a ""Roamer"" role(Or more than Scout already is). * Crossbow arrows still heal the same amount like how the Backscratcher works. * If you can't math : 52/126 health from Small/Medium health packs. &amp;nbsp; **Sun-on-a-Stick** &amp;nbsp; ~~**On hit : Inflicts afterburn for 5 seconds**~~ ~~*On miss : Hit yourself. Idiot.*~~ &amp;nbsp; * ""Let's add a weapon that critical hits burning enemies but the class using it can't burn players"" * Yeah probably wasn't the greatest idea. &amp;nbsp; **Soldier** &amp;nbsp; **Rocket Launchers** ~~Targets launched airborne by explosions from either user or self damage receive no falloff from direct hits from all rockets~~ &amp;nbsp; Just a small buff added to reward players for hitting airshots regardless of rocket launcher. &amp;nbsp; **Black Box** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Changed ""On Hit: Gain up to +20 health per attack"" to ""On Kill: Gain 50% of base health""**~~ &amp;nbsp; * If you've ever fought a Black Box Soldier buffed with the Concherer then you know how nigh impossible they are to kill and in my opinion the whole concept of ""Healing on hit"" is not really fair to play against because players can easily get bunched together and because of the healing which it allows give a significant advantage over your opponent so to give other classes a balanced chance to be able kill these ""Healing on hit"" users is to change it to a ""Healing on kill"" so they are actually deserving of the health. * I totally didn't just copy and paste the same thing from the Mad Milk rebalance. &amp;nbsp; **Direct Hit** &amp;nbsp; ~~*Added +35% Self-Inflicted Damage*~~ (Stacks percentage with Gunboats) &amp;nbsp; * I know some people will argue with ""The Direct hit rewards players for precision/accuracy with more damage"" but really the Direct Hit doesn't really have a downside sure you could say that the Direct Hit isn't good at spamming chokes from close/far away or hitting groups of players but that situation is well.. situational while the upsides are always present all the time so i gave it a downside that is also always present all the time. * If you can't math : 37 - 61 Self Damage, 20 - 35 Self Damage with Gunboats &amp;nbsp; **Begger's Bazooka** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Increased max clip held from 3 to 4**~~ ~~*Increased degrees random projectile deviation from +3 to +4*~~ ~~*Added +35% Self-Inflicted damage*~~ (Percentage stacks with Gunboats) ~~*No ammo from dispensers while active*~~ &amp;nbsp; * User can now ""Overload Jump"" for a max of 4(or was it 5..) before the clip runs out. &amp;nbsp; **Air Strike** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Clip size increased on kill**~~ ~~*-35% Slower Reload speed*~~ ~~While Grounded:~~ ~~*Projectile moves at 840 HU/s*~~ ~~While Blast jumping:~~ ~~**This weapon has no falloff**~~ ~~**+70% Firing Speed**~~ ~~**Projectile moves at 1980 HU/s**~~ ~~*75 Base damage*~~ ~~*-35% less explosion radius*~~ &amp;nbsp; * The current Air Strike's stats are bit all over the place i mean.. the summary of the stats are basically +1 clip size on kill which is means potenial damage, always less damage(Damage penalty+Explosion radius)... and less damage(Damage penalty+Explosion radius+Falloff) faster while blast jumping. &amp;nbsp; **Righteous Bison** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Increased projectile speed from 840 HU/s to 1200 HU/s**~~ ~~**Alt-fire : A charged shot that has no falloff and sets enemies on fire**~~ ~~Projectile penetrates enemy targets for a max of twice in a row instead of three times or more if players follow the beam shot~~ ~~*Deals only 20% damage to buildings*~~ ~~*-34% Clip size*~~ ~~Removed ""Projectile damage reduced by 25% for each enemy penetrated.""~~ &amp;nbsp; * Projectile can now be reflected by pyros * Bison now has an alt-fire for an option for long range damage * It didn't deserve most of its nerfs mym.. &amp;nbsp; **Buff Banner** &amp;nbsp; ~~**+2 Clip Size**~~ ~~**+20 Max Primary Ammo**~~ ~~Provides an offensive buff that causes nearby team members to do mini-crits. Rage increases through damage done.~~ &amp;nbsp; * To make it more on par with the Battalion's Backup i think giving it a passive bonuses involving ""Damage"" similiar to the other banner's passives which follow their ""Health"" and ""Health Recovery"" respectively. &amp;nbsp; **Concherer** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Changed ""35% Health on hit"" to ""Restores 50% health upon killing an enemy. Health restored above maximum is transferred to overheal.""**~~ ~~**Increased regen from +4 to +10. Getting recently damaged will reset the regen to +1 but will climb back up by +1 per second**~~ ~~**+50% health from pickups**~~ ~~*Now requires user to deal 600 damage to fill rage*~~ &amp;nbsp; * ""35% Health on hit""(or 17-39 health per rocket) is a pretty pathetic buff and definately not worth sacrifcing your Gun or a pair of Nike Shoes(Gunboats) in most cases since alot of classes can do 100 damage per hit anyway. * Added more ""Recovery"" passives to make up for the increased damage required to full boost. &amp;nbsp; **Equalizer** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Increased Primary, Secondary and Melee firing speed, reload speed, and switch to/from speed as health decreases**~~ ~~*-90% less healing from Mediguns*~~ ~~While Active~~ ~~**Damage increases as health decreases**~~ &amp;nbsp; * The Equalizer is generally overlooked for the increased mobility provided by the Escape Plan. The difference between the two being: The Equalizer can aid a player in trying to stop damage coming in when low health (kill the enemy) to survive; whilst the Escape Plan helps the player to escape the damage to survive. As it is rare to be in an opportune melee position against another proficient player, escaping damage is more reliable. Coupled with the rollout ability provided by the Escape Plan, the Equalizer is not particularly useful. * tl;dr summary : Mobility is always useful because of rollout potential and avoiding death while hitting people with your Melee is rare, not as useful and usually lead to death. ""Increased all weapon firing, reload, and switch to/from speed as health decreases"" includes your Primary, Secondary and Melee. * ""Increased all weapon firing, reload, and switch to/from speed as health decreases"" increases their speed by 20% every 50 health(or 20%=150, 40%=100, 60%=50, 80%=1). &amp;nbsp; **Pyro** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Increased base speed to 115% or 345 HU/s from 100% or 300 HU/s**~~ ~~*Decreased base health from 175 to 150 to compensate for the speed increase*~~ ~~**Airblasting teamates now cures Jarate, Mad Milk and Afterburn**~~ ~~**Pyro has a passive 0.2 weapon switch to and from speed compared to every other class which is 0.5**~~ ~~**Decreased airblast cooldown from 0.75 seconds to 0.5 seconds**~~ ~~**Increased healing from extinguishing friendly players from 20 health to 50 health**~~ ~~**On Reflect: Timer based projectiles get reset.**~~ ~~**On Airblast to teammates: Immediately cures the effects of Afterburn, Jarate, Mad Milk and user receives 50 health if teammates are under their effects.**~~ ~~**All Pyro melees will mini crit burning enemies, with the exception of Axtinguisher**~~ ~~*While using primary fire and 1 second after, speed is lowered to 70% or 210 HU/s*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Increased the self healing to provide the Pyro more passive abilities to stay in the frontlines for longer similiar to how Medic has passive regeneration to help him be more of a frontline support. * Nerfed the obvious ""w+m1"" meme with the lower base health and movement speed penalty. * Reflecting Pipebombs, Canonballs and Stickybombs now resets their explosion timer. &amp;nbsp; **Backburner** &amp;nbsp; ~~**100% Critical hits from behind**~~ ~~**+10 Seconds afterburn**~~ ~~**Does not have a movement speed penalty for firing**~~ ~~*+1s Airblast cooldown*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Made the Backburner more of an Afterburn based weapon since its only upside almost never happens in most cases while its downside ""+150% airblast cost"" is way too harsh in comparison. * Replaced the Airblast cost with an increased cooldown(which is now 1.5s inbetween airblasting). &amp;nbsp; **Degreaser** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Curing teammates will heal the user +75 HP**~~ ~~**-50% Airblast cooldown**~~ ~~*User cannot inflict afterburn*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Made the Degreaser more of an Airblast based weapon in contrast to the Backburner and because Pyro in general already has faster weapon switch speed. &amp;nbsp; **Phlogistinator** &amp;nbsp; ~~Moved ""MMMPH"" activation key to ""Special Key"" or Mouse 3 on Default Settings~~ ~~**Alt-Fire now triggers a ""Fireblast"". Fireblast disintegrates all projectiles in a short range(Airblast range) and inflicts afterburn. Using Alt-Fire on burning/jarate'd/milked teammates will fill 20% of ""MMMPH"" and cures afterburn and vaporizes jarate/milk.**~~ ~~**While ""MMMPH"" is activated: User receives 50% of base health on kill(75 health on kill) and guranteed critical hits for 8 seconds. User cannot be healed by other sources while activated and moves at base speed(345 HU/s) while activated.**~~ ~~Dealing damage does not fill ""MMMPH"" meter~~ &amp;nbsp; * Now rewards players for being more support oriented &amp;nbsp; **Manmelter** &amp;nbsp; ~~**+50% faster projectile speed**~~ ~~**Alt-fire: Extinguish teammates to gain guaranteed critical hits**~~ ~~**+70% Damage bonus**~~ ~~*Can only be fired with guranteed critical hits stored*~~ ~~*Does not inflict afterburn*~~ ~~*100% Slower firing speed*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Pyro being a close range class is very weak against Snipers. This weapon will become an answer to snipers and enemies at longer ranges which can be useful for taking out key targets but at the cost of the Stock Shotgun. &amp;nbsp; **Detonator and Scorch Shot** &amp;nbsp; ~~Increased Self-Knockback and Self-Damage to match Stickybomb level~~ ~~Scorch Shot stats now match/follows the Detonator stats~~ &amp;nbsp; * What was even the purpose of the Scorch Shot anyway... * Now the purpose of the Detonator/Scorch Shot is an increased mobility option for the Pyro in exchange for the Shotgun' close range DPS and the Flare/Manmelter' long range damage capability. &amp;nbsp; **Axtinguisher** &amp;nbsp; ~~**100% critical hits vs burning targets**~~ ~~*-25 Max health*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Will make Pyro lean towards the ""Pick class"" catagory when equipped and from my experience should always obey the rules ""Low health and high mobility/range""(similiar to the Scout, Sniper and Spy) which the Pyro does not follow currently. &amp;nbsp; **Powerjack** &amp;nbsp; ~~**+15% movement speed or +45 HU/s**~~ ~~*-25 max health*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Simple stats with a simple purpose. The faster speed can allow the Pyro to maintain a roaming playstyle. &amp;nbsp; **Third Degree** &amp;nbsp; ~~**All players connected via Medigun beams are hit, damage will multiply per player. Primary and Secondary are also effected by this stat.**~~ ~~*-25 max health*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Math : If there is one medic healing a diffrent class it will deal x2 damage. If there are 2 medics healing each other it will deal x4. If there are 3 players(A demoman and 2 medic for example) it will deal x3 damage. &amp;nbsp; **Sharpened Volcano Fragment** &amp;nbsp; ~~**On hit: +10 Seconds of afterburn. Primary and Secondary are also effected by this stat. Afterburn caps at 10 seconds for secondary weapons.**~~ ~~*-25 Max Health*~~ &amp;nbsp; * The Sharpened Volcano Fragment is considered unnecessary due to the fact that your primary already sets players on fire. I think it should be repurposed to increase the Pyro's heal blocking support capabilities. &amp;nbsp; **Homewrecker** &amp;nbsp; ~~**On hit: Destroys sappers**~~ ~~**+75 Max health**~~ ~~*Lowers users base speed to 70% or 210 HU/s*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Added stats to encourage playing defensively around Engineer sentry nests(AKA Pybro). I added them because the Homewrecker is a little underwhelming compared to the versatility of the Powerjack's speed boost and even the Backscratcher's health pack value increase. &amp;nbsp; **Backscratcher** &amp;nbsp; ~~**+25% Damage bonus**~~ ~~**Increases health from pickups by 100%.**~~ ~~*-80% healing from Mediguns*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Now more of a versatile unlock that allows the Pyro to deal 110 damage on hit vs burning players and turns Medium/Small health packs into Full/Almost-Medium health packs at the cost of losing the ability to be a pocket but can be pretty effective as a roamer."
462,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,"[IG] ""Weapon and Class Rebalances/Pyro Update wishlist part 2"" &lt;Demoman, Heavy, Engineer&gt;",0,6gu2kx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/6gu2kx/ig_weapon_and_class_rebalancespyro_update/,2017-06-13 04:21:39,"**Demoman** &amp;nbsp; **Loch-n-Load** &amp;nbsp; ~~**20% more damage to buildings**~~ ~~**Hold fire to load up to 2 grenades. Shots can be held and released at will.**~~ ~~*Launched bombs shatter on surfaces*~~ ~~*Launched bombs shatter 1 second after being fired*~~ ~~This weapon fires 2 grenades at once~~ &amp;nbsp; * Loch-n-Load grenades will shatter once they either hit a surface, players/buildings, and the second they travel 1216.6 HU/s(approximately). Added in because Grenades, on direct hit, will do 100 damage with no falloff so i think the grenades shattering after 1 second is a good substitute for that. But maybe just adding falloff might work or make it shatter faster than 1 second might be better. &amp;nbsp; **Iron Bomber** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Grenades have very little bounce and roll**~~ ~~**-60% fuse time on grenades. Fuse starts once an enemy approaches its blast radius. All grenades shot have the same fuse. Max of 4 grenades out.**~~ ~~*+4 degrees random projectile deviation*~~ ~~*-40% Damage penalty against players on direct hit*~~ &amp;nbsp; * I personally don't like how the Iron Bomber had somehow turned into a carbon copy of the stock Grenade Launcher. I think there should be a little bit more variety in unlocks for like for example the Direct Hit and the Gunslinger. * I think the Iron Bomber should be more Defence Oriented and Area Denial-ish but sacrifices the Demoman's close to mid-range damage. &amp;nbsp; **Ali Baba's Wee Booties/Bootlegger** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Generates 1% of charge per second. Shield only.**~~ ~~**+50 Max health**~~ ~~*-30% movement speed or 90 HU/s less*~~ &amp;nbsp; * I think the reason they nerfed the Demo Boots is because of it has contradicting stats that should not be together(""+25 Max Health"" and ""+10% movement speed"") which made the Stickybomb Launcher a bit ""overpowered"" in public servers. Not that its a problem in higher-levels since Grenades Are usually better but i think my solution may be the ""best of both worlds"" so to speak.(But correct me if i'm wrong and state the reason you think so.) &amp;nbsp; **Demoman Shields** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Changed charge automatic regen to build up by dealing damage. Demoman Boots will generate 1% of charge per second.**~~ ~~**Changed charge mechanic to ""100% critical hits with Melee for and movement speed is 250% for 8 seconds(Mini-crits if Tide Turner). User can cancel out of the Charge by switching to Primary.""**~~ ~~**Chargin' Targe: 800 Damage required to fill Charge. 40% Fire and Explosive resistance on wearer.**~~ ~~**Splendid Screen: 520 Damage required to fill Charge(35% less than Chargin' Targe). 25% Fire and Explosive resistance on wearer.**~~ ~~**Tide Turner: 240 Damage required to fill Charge(70% less than Chargin Targe). 15% Fire and Explosive resistance on wearer.While charging: Attack mini-crit.**~~ &amp;nbsp; * The Stickybomb launcher is incredibly versatile, able to both lead offensive pushes or to defend a given area with its area denial, choke spamming and crowd control. The Shields (Chargin' Targe, Splendid Screen and Tide Turner) has none of those and less while also replaces the Stickybomb Launcher slot. * Since the Stickybomb launcher has the ability to slow the game down with its area denial. The purpose of the shields should be stalemate breaking.(which happens far too often in competitive.) &amp;nbsp; **Bag Pipes** (Secondary weapon idea) &amp;nbsp; ~~**+50 Max health**~~ ~~**+2 Primary clip size**~~ ~~**+14 Primary ammo carried**~~ ~~**Grenades can deal direct hit damage(100 dmg) after bouncing**~~ ~~**Alt-Fire: Creates an explosion that propels user towards the crosshair at the cost of 48 health. Explosion can harm enemies within 146 HU of user.**~~ ~~*-75% Healing from Mediguns*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Just an idea i had. I'm not sure if it will be good in practice but the main point of this secondary is a Roamer Playstyle for Demoman at the cost of his defensive capabilities(Area Denial, Choke spamming and Medic pocketing capabilities). * Added the healing penalty so Medics can't keep the Demoman at 225 to 338 health. * Also a pretty fun Demoknight weapon to pair with the Demoman Shoes. &amp;nbsp; **Quickiebomb Launcher** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Able to destroy enemy stickybombs**~~ ~~**Has immediate bomb arm time**~~ ~~**Max charge time decreased by 70%**~~ ~~**Up to +100% explosion radius based on charge**~~ ~~*-50% clip size*~~ ~~*Stickybombs fizzle 4 seconds after landing on a surface*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Reapplied the fizzle timer because i think there should be more variety in unlocks and i think the current version is far too similiar to the stock version and not its own thing. * Now the purpose i think the Quickiebomb should have is a Close-Combat and Defense breaking weapon at the cost of his own Defensive capabilities. (Examples of defense breaking: Clearing sticky traps on objectives or walls, Sentry Guns at long ranges and Pyros &lt;since they cannot reset the timer&gt;) &amp;nbsp; **Scottish Resistance** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Increased max stickybombs out from +6 to +8**~~ ~~**Stickybombs are be pushed back 60% less by explosives and compression blasts**~~ ~~**Stickybombs cannot be destroyed by hitscan weapons**~~ &amp;nbsp; * Just a small buff to even out its slower bomb arm time because i think its fine where it is now.(Which is twice as long as stock.) &amp;nbsp; **The Claidheamh Mr** &amp;nbsp; ~~**On hit: Inflicts 5 seconds of bleed with Melee, Primary and Secondary weapons**~~ ~~**+2 seconds of maximum Charge duration**~~ ~~*-25 Max health*~~ ~~This weapon has an 80% larger melee range and deploys and holsters 100% slower~~ &amp;nbsp; * The Claidheamh Mr is the only Demo Sword that i have a serious problem with for good and obvious reasons. I repurposed the Claidheamh Mr to be a Support-Heal Blocking oriented sword. Of course at the cost of being ""Support"" the max health is reduced to 150. &amp;nbsp; **Heavy** &amp;nbsp; **All Miniguns** ~~**Minigun bullets can penetrate players.**~~ ~~**While spun up : -60% knockback from Airblast and Explosives**~~ ~~**Decreased movement speed penalty while spun up from 37% to 51%**~~ &amp;nbsp; * The reasoning for the penetration is to make Heavy be able to do damage more than a single target at a time similiar to the Explosive classes and make him slightly more effective in choke points. Although i am not sure of the max amount of players penetrated should be. &amp;nbsp; **Natascha** &amp;nbsp; ~~**+75 Max health. Does not change default overheal cap.**~~ ~~**Knockback Rage: Generate Rage by dealing damage. When fully charged, press the Special-Attack key to activate knockback.**~~ ~~*Base speed lowered from 77% or 231 HU/s to 51% or 153 HU/s*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Slowdown at all times can be frustrating and annoying to play against. So possibly making its slowdown mechanic only sometimes might fix the problem of it being incredibly frustrating. &amp;nbsp; **Brass Beast** &amp;nbsp; ~~**+75 Max health. Does not change default overheal cap.**~~ ~~**+35% damage bonus**~~ ~~*Base speed lowered from 231 HU/s to 153 HU/s*~~ ~~*-60% slower move speed while spun up*~~ &amp;nbsp; * The Brass Beast weapon further accentuates the Heavy's strengths and weaknesses, thereby making the Heavy even more of a niche class, as the Heavy is only able to be useful in a smaller subset of situations. The heavy becomes alike a Sentry Gun which is able to pick itself up and move. &amp;nbsp; **Huo-Long Heater** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Creates a ring of flames at range of 150 HU while spun up**~~ ~~**On hit: Inflicts 0.5 seconds of afterburn**~~ ~~*Consumes an additional 8 ammo per second while spun up**~~ &amp;nbsp; * Increased ammo drain from 4 to 8 because of the buff to Afterburn/Bleeding mentioned above. * Added the ""On hit: Inflicts 0.5 seconds of afterburn"" to make this minigun the go to Minigun to take on Medics and their Pocket with its Heal Blocking and its effective more damage with afterburn. &amp;nbsp; **Tomislav** &amp;nbsp; ~~**User moves at 77% or 231 HU/s while spun up**~~ ~~**+75% spin-up time reduction**~~ ~~**+50% more accurate**~~ ~~**Silent Killer: No barrel spin sound**~~ ~~*-50% slower firing speed*~~ &amp;nbsp; * The Tomislav is suited to a roaming playstyle and is best paired with the Sandvich and GRU for higher survivability without a Medic. The weapon's silent spin up is useful for preparing ambushes, and makes the heavy more viable as a flanking class. The 50% increase in accuracy also gives the Heavy better long range capability. Downside is that it has half the DPS of the stock Minigun(20 rounds per second from 40) resulting in 90 - 270 dps from 180 - 540 dps. &amp;nbsp; **Ammo Rezerv** (Name by Uncle Dane) &amp;nbsp; ~~**+400 Primary ammo carried**~~ ~~**Primary or Alt-Fire while weapon is active: Throw a full ammo pack at the cost of 200 Primary ammo**~~ &amp;nbsp; * Of course this is just a little improvement on Dane's weapon concept. I'm sure he can explain its use better than i can. &amp;nbsp; **Buffalo Steak Sandvich** &amp;nbsp; ~~**+35% Movespeed or +80.5 HU/s**~~ ~~*-75 Max health*~~ ~~While under the effects: Attacks mini crit and the player may only use melee weapons. Switching off from Melee will remove the effects.~~ ~~Alt-fire: Share with a friend (Medium Health Kit)~~ &amp;nbsp; * Moved the movespeed buff to be passive bonuses similiar to Soldier's Banners. Moved them because the increased movement speed was a little unbalanced since you don't lose anything if you use it unlike Blast jumping. Example being in competitive 5cp/KoTH Heavy can reach mid at almost Medic speed while still keeping his high health, 450 overheal and his damage. &amp;nbsp; **Dalokohs Bar** &amp;nbsp; ~~**+75 Max health**~~ ~~*-35% Movespeed or -80.5 HU/s*~~ ~~Alt-fire: Share with a friend (Medium Health Kit)~~ &amp;nbsp; * Like the Buffalo Steak, i moved the bonuses to become passive like the Soldier Banners so i could downsides to balance it out. Having good stats and bad for a small duration of time, like the steak, can be difficult to balance because its downsides are only active when its upside is also active. (Other examples: GRU, Eviction Notice, FoS.) &amp;nbsp; **Heavy Shotguns** &amp;nbsp; ~~**+50% Faster reload speed compared to most other classes**~~ ~~**Heavy has a passive reload while weapon is not active.**~~ &amp;nbsp; * My attempt to make Heavy's shotguns viable. &amp;nbsp; **Gloves of Running Urgently** &amp;nbsp; ~~*Lowered Base health to 200*~~ ~~When weapon is active~~ ~~**Move speed increases as the user becomes injured**~~ ~~*You are marked for death while active, and for short period after switching weapons*~~ ~~*-90% less healing from Medic sources*~~ &amp;nbsp; * A problem with the GRU is that it is always good all the time. Meaning its good in most situations like Rollouts, Heading back into the frontlines, repositioning and running away. I think a good way to fix this is to make it so its only good when you're low health.(Plus the Urgently part of its name will actually make sense) &amp;nbsp; **Fists of Steel** &amp;nbsp; ~~*Added ""-100% less healing from Mediguns while active""*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Added in the healing penalty because this weapon is incredibly frustrating to play against if the Heavy has a Medic healing him to 450 Health and with that resistance the Heavy is effectively immune to Fully Charged Headshots. &amp;nbsp; **Warrior's Spirit** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Added ""Crits whenever it would normally mini-crit**~~ ~~*Replaced ""30% damage vulnerability on wearer"" with ""-50 Max health""*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Added the ""Mini-Crit = Crit"" mechanic from the Bushwacka this weapon to make it synergise better with the Buffalo Steak similiar to how the Bushwacka and the Jarate/Cleaner's Carbine synergise well with each other. * ""You do 30% more damage with your melee and get 50 health back... but you take 30% more damage from all sources."" Not the greatest unlock design. &amp;nbsp; **Engineer** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Increased Base health from 125 to 150**~~ &amp;nbsp; **Widowmaker** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Added ""Damage increased by 5% for each building active and upgraded. Inactive Teleporters does not give increased damage."" This stat replaces ""10% increased damage to your sentry's target"".**~~ &amp;nbsp; * I think the reason they even added that new stat from Meet Your Match was because players using the Widowmaker weren't constructing and upgrading buildings like they were supposed to. Although the Widowmaker doesn't need the buff since its already a decent unlock for the Engineer. &amp;nbsp; **Pomson 6000** &amp;nbsp; ~~Weapon does not have Ramp-up damage~~ ~~Base damage changed from 60 to 45~~ ~~Projectile penetrates enemy targets for a max of twice in a row.~~ ~~**Increased projectile speed to 1200 HU/s**~~ ~~**Alt-fire : A charged shot that has no falloff and sets enemies on fire.**~~ ~~*Deals only 20% damage to buildings*~~ ~~*-34% Clip size*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Removed the whole Uber and Cloak draining mechanic because not only is it not fun to play against and isn't a good weapon is because Uber is pivotal and gives the team that's not using it a passive disadvantage similiar to the Dangershield and Vita-Saw. &amp;nbsp; **Rescue Ranger** &amp;nbsp; ~~**On hit: Repairs 50% of buildings health. Up to 100% if user is farther away.**~~ ~~**Alt-Fire: Use 100 metal to pick up buildings from long range**~~ ~~*Self mark for death on building pick up*~~ ~~*Per Shot: -50 ammo. Uses metal for ammo.*~~ &amp;nbsp; * As much as i like the concept for the Rescue Ranger, healing buildings away from splash damage and relocating them almost instantly all at the cost of self defence, i don't like how the Engineer can heal his buildings with no other sacrifice or cost to the user other than they can't defend themselves as well as if they has the Shotgun. &amp;nbsp; **Wrangler** &amp;nbsp; ~~Changed shield mechanic to be a seperate object from the Sentry Gun. Wrangler shield has 200 health and requires a 15 second recharge to reactivate if shield is destroyed. Wrench and Rescue Ranger will repair Sentry Gun normally but cannot repair the wrangler shield.~~ &amp;nbsp; * My attempt at making the Wrangler much easier to handle in a smaller team environment. &amp;nbsp; **Short Circuit** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Changed primary fire to have a 0.5 second cooldown between firing and have 35 Base Damage. Primary fire costs 15 metal per shot. Can track cloaked or disguised spys.**~~ ~~**Alt-fire: Delete projectiles at the cost of 50% base damage of the Projectile deleted. Alt-Fire only activates and uses metal if there is a projectile to be deleted.**~~ ~~*Engineer can not draw metal from allied Dispensers or Payload carts and not pick up buildings*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Changed the projectile deleting to metal spent more sensical. Now Rockets deleted take 45 Metal from the Engineer, Stickybombs take 60 metal and Grenades take 50 metal. Metal cost does not increase if Short Circuit deletes multiple of the same projectile at the same time(Example: Stickytraps and 2 of the same projectile at the same time). &amp;nbsp; **Stock Wrench** &amp;nbsp; ~~While upgrading: Uses 40 metal to upgrade buildings.~~ &amp;nbsp; * This is a stock only buff since currently its weakest out of the 5 Engineer melee unlocks. &amp;nbsp; **Jag** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Construction hit speed boost increased by 50%**~~ ~~**While upgrading: Uses 50 metal to upgrade buildings.**~~ ~~*-50% damage penalty vs buildings*~~ ~~*20% slower repair rate*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Replaced the faster swing speed and with an increased upgrade per hit because the swing speed stat and the repair penalty stat contradict each other. Sure when it calculate it it does turn out with a less healing per second from Stock but only by a small margin. * Also increased the Construction hit speed boost and sapper slaying penalty to really make buildings more disposable and easily replaced. &amp;nbsp; **Southern Hospitality** &amp;nbsp; ~~**User can build a max of 2 of each of the same building.**~~ ~~**On hit: Bleed for 5 seconds**~~ ~~*-75 Max health*~~ ~~*-25% movespeed while hauling from -10%*~~ ~~*While upgrading: Uses 25 metal to upgrade buildings*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Completely reworked the Southern Hospitality because currently its basically a carbon copy of the stock and its only upside was indirectly nerfed in Gun Mettle(Cloaking halves all status effects like bleeding and afterburn.) * I think the Southern Hospitality should be a hyper defensive version of the Stock by further accentuating the Engineer's strengths and weaknesses forcing the engineer to play more passively. * Math : Will bring the Engineer's max health from 150 to 75 and while hauling movespeed is lowered to 225 HU/s from 270 HU/s. &amp;nbsp; **Gunslinger** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Changed ""+25 max health on wearer"" to ""+15% movespeed on wearer.**~~ ~~**Added ""User gains healing beams that replenishes 20 health/sec, 40% ammo/sec and 60 Metal/5 sec, healing beams are 450 HU's in length, but User regenerates 10 health/sec, 20% ammo/sec, and 30 metal/5 sec"". (This is 2)**~~ ~~**Replaces Dispensers with a Healing Node. Healing Node's initial construction takes 5.25 seconds, cannot be upgraded, and exhibits the same stats as stat (2).**~~ ~~*If your Healing Node is active, it will remove stat (2)*~~ ~~While upgrading: Uses 40 metal to upgrade buildings.~~ &amp;nbsp; * With the Health/Ammo/Metal regeneration it will allow the Engineer to stay in fights for longer, which is something a wrench engineer can't do, simply because his health is too low and his damage output is subpar compared to the ""Power Classes"" like Demoman and Soldier, with the regeneration it gives the Engineer more survivability which is insanely important for a Support Class who's basic effectiveness revolves around being alive to maintain his support capabilities. With the regeneration of health and ammo, it will make the Engineer a frontline support rather than stationary and static backline defense that can occasionally stall Ubers. * The speed can be useful for getting out sticky situations, rollouts/positioning, getting buildings to where they belong faster, and closing the distance between enemies. Changed it mainly because Engineer already has a passive 150 health(As mentioned above) and the speed buff is to increase the Engineer's viability in fast paced games and despite being considered a ""Support"" class Engineer has always been the one that lags behind and always late &amp;nbsp; **Jigsaw** (Melee, Cybernetic Chainsaw Arm Extention) &amp;nbsp; ~~**Metal Reserves will act as Health, Damage will always hit Metal reserves first, Headshot crits ignore this stat**~~ ~~**Holding Alt-Fire while active : User moves at 450 HU/s but drains 5 metal every 0.5 seconds.**~~ ~~**Primary and Secondary weapons will have slight aim assist similiar to the Wrangler, team coloured beam of light included and gains +75% faster firing speed.(This is stat 3)**~~ ~~**User gains healing beams that replenishes 15 health/sec, 30% ammo/sec and 50 Metal/5 sec, healing beams that are 450 HU in length. But User regenerates 7.5 health/sec, 15% ammo/sec, and 25 metal/5 sec.(This is stat 4)**~~ ~~**Sentry Guns and Dispensers costs 50 metal each and start at 50% health on initial construction.**~~ ~~**+60% Damage bonus**~~ ~~*-125 Max Health*~~ ~~*-20% Movespeed*~~ ~~*Buildings cannot be upgraded, repaired, or construction boosted with this Melee. Friendly engineers also cannot repair or upgrade your buildings.*~~ ~~*If your Sentry Gun or Dispenser is active(currently able to heal/shoot), Maximum metal capacity will decrease by 50 and removes the benefits from stat (3, if Sentry Gun) and (4, if Dispenser)*~~ ~~This weapon has a large melee range and deploys and holsters slower.~~ &amp;nbsp; * Designed similiarly to the Gunslinger but with more increased movespeed which can be very useful for getting out sticky situations, rollouts/positioning, getting buildings to where they belong faster, and closing the distance between enemies.

While healing, patient also receives this stat on their Primary, Secondary and Melee.**~~ &amp;nbsp; * Since the Syringe Gun is supposed to be a ""Self-Defence"" weapon i thought giving the ability to bleed similiar to how TFC's Medic infects enemies. Bleeding blocks healing from Mediguns and Dispensers as mentioned in part 1. * My attempt at buffing Medic' primary weapons, the syringe guns. While this weapon is equipped the User will have an advantage over another Medic in fights but of course at the cost of not equipping the Crusader's Crossbow which can build uber a bit faster than the Stock Medigun and can heal up to +150 health from a distance. &amp;nbsp; **Blutsauger** &amp;nbsp; ~~**On Hit: Gain up to +3 health**~~ ~~**On Kill/Assist: User receives 50% of base health, whoever assisted also gains the healing.

The Blutsauger's purpose now is survivability for both the Medic and his heal target &amp;nbsp; **Overdose** &amp;nbsp; ~~**While active, movement speed increases based on berCharge and Health percentage to a maximum of +50% or 480 HU/s.**~~ ~~**On hit: 100% Chance to slow targets for 2.5 seconds**~~ ~~*-50% Clip Size*~~ ~~*While active, User is marked for death while active and after use for 1 second.*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Math: +10% Movespeed per 20% Uber. +10% Movespeed per 30 Health lost. Slowdown mechanic is identical to the current Natascha. * Since the Overdose' purpose is to run away from danger if Uber i think we should expand upon that concept and not change it too much from its original purpose. More of a selfish tool for the Medic to maintain Ubercharge and your life instead of a supportive tool like the other Primary weapons. &amp;nbsp; **Vaccinator** &amp;nbsp; ~~**bercharge provides a 2.5 second resistance bubble that blocks 75% base damage and 100% crit damage for Fire, Bullets and Explosives at once.**~~ ~~**While healing, provides you and your target with a constant 10% resistance to Fire, Bullets and Explosives at once.**~~ ~~*-66% Overheal build rate.*~~ ~~*Up to -100% Uber build rate if patient has been recently damaged. Builds back up fully after 10 seconds.*~~ ~~Charge fill speed : 2.5% /s while target is below 142.5% health and 1.25% /s when above 142.5% health~~ &amp;nbsp; * Nerfed its bercharge build rate because it is incredibly obnoxious to play against, causes horrible stalemates in competitive, it can effectively counter all other types of bercharge in most cases and it builds the fastest out of the four Mediguns while also having 4 charges they can use whenever they feel like making the Medic almost invulnerable. * Math : Build rate at normal Medigun speed, 1 Charge per atleast 10 seconds of healing and 2.5 seconds of uber per charge. &amp;nbsp; **Quick-Fix** &amp;nbsp; ~~**bercharge heals the Medic and Patient for 100.8hp /s for 2.5 seconds for a total of 252 Health per charge. User can build up to four charges.**~~ ~~**+40% heal rate.**~~ ~~*Up to -100% Overheal build rate if patient has been recently damaged. Builds back up fully after 10 seconds.*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Since the general Medigun buffs in Meet Your Match the Quick-Fix has taken a bit of a hit in terms of its viability. Right now the only reason to ever use the Quick-Fix in competitive is if you have an Uber Disadvantage and they aren't using the Kritzkrieg, and using it on King of the Hill maps when the team is pinched for time, and the Medic needs to deliver heals to the point quickly. * With the Ubercharge now segmented similiar to the Vaccinator the gameplay dynamic is changed for the Quick-Fix is now changing the game from Uber building for one big push to Uber micro-management and smaller, more focused pushes. Of course there are several weakness for this medigun which are focus firing, Sentry Guns, and other Mediguns such as the Kritzkrieg. * I just hope one day the comp community will use alternative Mediguns than stock for once. As effective as Invulnerability is the meta is definately getting a little stale with its ""Copy-Counter"" gameplay i think every medigun should be viable depending on what the other Medic is using and switching Mediguns to counter it. &amp;nbsp; **Sniper** &amp;nbsp; **Sniper Rifles** &amp;nbsp; ~~*Scoped shots deal reduced damage against enemies closer than 500 HU from the sniper. While scoped in, enemies outside this area are highlighted red/blue.*~~ ~~*100% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*25% slower charge rate*~~ ~~This doesn't apply to the Huntsman, Sydney Sleeper and Classic~~ ~~This damage decrease starts out at 20%, increasing as the sniper's target nears the sniper.

Damage is divided per player caught in the Headshot explosion.**~~ ~~**On hit: Inflicts bleed/jarate for up to 15 seconds based on charge.**~~ ~~*Cannot Headshot unless fully charged.*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Now designed for High Damage Crowd Control instead of a niche ""look around more"" version of the Stock that can't headshot. &amp;nbsp; **Huntsman** &amp;nbsp; ~~**On hit: Bleed for 5 seconds**~~ ~~**Headshots crit within 450 Units and Mini-Crit within 1536 Hammer units**~~ ~~**+25 Max health**~~ ~~**+15% Movespeed**~~ ~~**+90% healing from Mediguns**~~ ~~*Added 50% Falloff*~~ &amp;nbsp; * An option for the Sniper to take more of a mobile rather than its usual static playstyle. Health and increased medigun healing to provide more survivability(and also to nullify the some of the downsides from the secondaries). &amp;nbsp; **Darwin's Dangershield** &amp;nbsp; ~~**+25 Max health**~~ ~~**+15% Movement speed**~~ ~~*-25% Crit vulnerability on wearer*~~ ~~*-90% healing from Mediguns*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Changed the Dangershield's purpose from the crutch ""tank a headshot"" unlock to a more of a ""solo roamer playstyle"" for a class that is most of the time idle in certain spots. * The ability to tank a headshot is incredibly powerful to the point where if one sniper runs it the other will have to as well to avoid being at a passive disadvantage. Which is the reason why the Critical Hit vulnerability and medigun healing penalty was added. &amp;nbsp; **Razorback** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Blocks a single backstab. Razorback will recharge by picking up 2 full/4 medium/10 small ammo packs or by taking a new one from the Resupply cabinet.**~~ ~~**+25 Max health on wearer**~~ ~~*-90% Healing from Mediguns and user cannot be overhealed*~~ &amp;nbsp; * In public servers, the razorback is practically useless since there is no teamwork and the user will most likely be alone most of the time meaning its much easier for spys to 2-3 shot the user but in competitive, highlander/prolander specifically, the razorback is incredibly broken for reasons being that the Sniper will constantly be overhealed by the Medic meaning Snipers would be able to tank a quickscope headshot while also being immune to the class that is supposed to counter him in that situation. &amp;nbsp; **Cozy Camper** &amp;nbsp; ~~**While scoped in, user gains flinching and knockback immunity**~~ ~~**Up to +10 health regenerated on wearer**~~ ~~**+25 Max health**~~ ~~**+100% healing from pickups**~~ ~~*-90% Healing from Mediguns and user cannot be overhealed*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Similiarly redesigned like the Razorback, promoting playing without the need of a Medic. &amp;nbsp; **Shahanshah** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Increased Primary, Secondary and Melee firing speed, reload speed, and switch to/from speed as health decreases**~~ ~~While Active~~ ~~**Damage increases as health decreases**~~ ~~*-90% less healing from Mediguns*~~ &amp;nbsp; * Pretty much just Equalizer for the Sniper or i don't have much of an idea why the Shahanshah even exists so i just made it that way. &amp;nbsp; **Spy** * Increased base movement speed to 115% or 345 HU/s from 107% or 320 HU/s * Spy has a 60% faster weapon switch to and from speed than most classes. Only requiring 0.2 seconds to switch from and 0.2 seconds to switch to. * While invisible, user moves at 130% movespeed or 390 HU/s &amp;nbsp; **Stock Revolver** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Weapon mini-crits on headshot. On all revolvers, headshots inflicts 1 second of bleed**~~ ~~**Decreased weapon spread recovery from 1.25 to 0.8**~~ ~~*Increased firing speed from 0.58 to 0.8*~~ &amp;nbsp; * With the headshot mechanic added it can make the Revolver better at cleaning up low health enemies from a distance with its 54 damage on headshot and provide decent self defence with its 81 Mini-Crit headshot within close distances which is enough to kill 150 health classes in two hits. * Also don't you hate it when your crosshair is directly at somebody but the bullet spread makes you miss a majority of the time. * Stats do not apply to the L'Etranger. &amp;nbsp; **Ambassador** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Headshots deal critical damage within 450 HU. Can only headshot in that range**~~ &amp;nbsp; * Added a maximum range to headshot to lessen its lethality from a distance to make it more of Self-Defence version of the Stock but can't quite deal as much damage from a distance. &amp;nbsp; **Diamondback** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Increased base damage to 50**~~ ~~*Added ""Can only be fired with guranteed critical hits stored""*~~ ~~*Firing speed increased to 1.5*~~ &amp;nbsp; * ""You get guranteed critical hits which do 102 damage each for doing the exact same things you do usually."" &amp;nbsp; **Stock Sapper** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Increased sapper base damage from 25/s to 25% of buildings max health. Total of 4 seconds to destroy any type of building.**~~ ~~**On Unsap: There is a 1.5 second delay before the Sentry is active again.**~~ ~~*Requires 1 hit to unsap with the Stock Wrench and 2 hits from the Jag*~~ &amp;nbsp; * With these changes, interactions with Spys and turtling Engineers will be much more in the favor of the Spy. If the Engineer chooses to go for the unsap immediately, the increased delay time before the Sentry is active again will the Spy enough time to shoot two mini-crit headshots(effectively killing the engineer) and with the increased all around weapon deploy and holster speed for it will make the process much easier. Of course if all else fails continually re-sap the gun and it will go down in 4 seconds. &amp;nbsp; **Red-Tape Recorder** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Changed ""Reverses enemy building construction"" to ""Sapper now has a base damage of 10% of buildings max health. Total of 10 seconds to destroy any type of building""**~~ ~~**Requires 2 hits to unsap with the Stock Wrench and 4 hits from the Jag**~~ &amp;nbsp; * Made it much less frustrating for Engineers and much more if you are more Team-dependant rather than playing solo. With the increased time it takes for the Sentry to become active again it makes it very good for giving the team much more of an opening to take out the sentry gun. While if using the stock sapper its much more useful if you are destroying the sentry gun on your own. * Note: Red-Tape also has a 1.3 second delay before the Sentry is active again. &amp;nbsp; **Your Eternal Reward** &amp;nbsp; ~~**Silent Killer: No attack noise from backstabs**~~ ~~**Upon a successful backstab against a human target, you rapidly disguise as your victim and gain passive stats depending on disguise.**~~ ~~*Wearer cannot disguise*~~ ~~Disguise Stats~~ * Scout: User's movement speed is increased to 133% or 400 HU/s and gain the ability to double jump. * Soldier: Maximum health is increased to 200 and 60% explosive resistance. * Pyro: Maximum health is increased to 150 and user is immune to afterburn. * Demoman: Maximum health is increased to 175 and is 60% resistant to explosives. * Heavy: Maximum health is increased to 300 but cloaking and uncloaking duration is increased by 2 seconds. Total of 3 seconds to fully cloak/uncloak. * Engineer: Maximum health is increased to 150 and all enemy buildings will show a team coloured outline. * Medic: Maximum health is increased to 150, user will gain up to +10 health per second, and enemies calling Medic will be outlined. * Sniper: Primary weapon will critical hit on headshot from any distance. * Spy: All enemy players will be outlined with a team coloured glow. &amp;nbsp; * My attempt at making the Spy's worst melee(in competitive standards) viable. * The reason for the Spy disguise bonuses is because its very unlikely a Spy will encounter another Spy and also get a backstab on the Spy. &amp;nbsp; **Dead Ringer** &amp;nbsp; ~~*While invisible, user gains 35% damage resistance and critical hit immunity but headshots critcal hits ignores this stat and deal their usual damage.*~~ &amp;nbsp; * My attempt at removing all viability of the Headshot/Dead Ringer combo.

And no I did not make it. wish I did, though. URL With that said this is a improvement post, not a rebalance post. And I realize that it would most likely be a TF2.5 build, but things need to discussed. With that said, let's get started. **Changes to the Heavy stats** What do you think about the Love and War Heavy wind up nerf, the damage and accuracy is decreased unless you fire for 1 second? Kind of crap, eh? What if the wind up was just accuracy and maybe firing speed increase after 1 second of firing or more? Especially if the upside was something like 15% and I guess it could stack with the Tomi. *New Passive: Combat Surplus* What do you think of the classes having a mouse 3 function(and in the case of the medic mouse 2 on the primary and melee) that would help them out? For the Heavy specifically, mouse 3 is Combat Surplus. It works like this: Without food items. On kill: 2 small health packs that look like team colored candy bars. On assist: 1 team colored candy bar. Mouse 3 to throw the candy bar that acts like a map pickup. Killing a Heavy with several candy bars makes the heavy drop the candy bars. With food items. On kill:20% recharge back. On assist:10% recharge back. *Rage Mode* Also there is a thread on SPUF called called a Proper rework for a Heavy and it has a RAGE meter for the Heavy as a default. and yes headshots and backstabs still hurt as badly. you build it by doing and receiving damage, it is a 70:30 ratio. What this does is make the Heavy take more damage, thanks to the fact that the RAGE makes you more resistant to damage. unrevved but with some RAGE charge is 15% damage resistance, revved up is 25 to 30% of that, and when meter is at 70% and 100% 7 or 10 seconds of 45% damage resistance on all slots. And I had the idea to make RAGE mode have a additional function depending on the minigun. For the minigun RAGE this stuff is the effects over all the slots: Stock minigun RAGE effect would be extra damage, maybe 15% to 25%. Natasha would offer slow effect on activated RAGE. Brass Beast, ""On kill: 25HP(or more)"" stat as a RAGE ability for your loadout and you move around 50% of your movement speed with the BB revved up instead of 15% or at normal revved up Heavy speed. Tomislav, ""On kill:Speed boost for 4 seconds"" stat on everything in your loadout. Huo long Heater, with RAGE activated fire damage on everything in your loadout. And the minigun damage is the fire boosted one with the fire bullets. Switching away from the minigun burns you for degreaser afterburn damage. *minigun stuff* And there is a ""holster miniguns to be faster for 8%"" stat as well, which I think would stack with some speed booster items. As well as a LMG variant of the miniguns. which is about making the Holster miniguns for speed boost be in effect on your Primary, for the price of having your 200 ammo points by 4 bullets be 800 bullets total spread over 4 magazines and you need to relaod a Heavy primary and still have a Revv up. I have an idea to buff the Buffalo steak and the Warrior's spirit. First both of the items should have 35% damage vulnerability combined, so 15% damage vulnerability each? Also for a Steak that makes you go in to a melee only frenzy, there is no overheal for the Heavy? Full Overheal and a bit like the Kunai Overheal as overheal deteriorates slower, and maybe even HP on kill? Warrior's spirit, make it a fast hitting melee item, and add the 10HP on hit stat as well as the 50HP stat, with the option to Overheal the Heavy and maybe minicrits are crits if it is fair. What about the Brass Beast and Natasha? 20% resistance on kill, as well as the 50% HP activates the 20% resistance when spun up. Your thoughts on this? "

It has two designs in one weapon: help friendly engineers and hurt enemy buildings. Here are two buffs to the weapon, one that makes it better at support and one that makes it better at offense. 1. ~~**Alt fire / taunt: Pyro scratches their head and looks at the homewrecker with a puzzled expression. After a 3 second taunt they perform an overhead slam attack with the homewrecker dealing 500 damage to one enemy, or repairing a friendly building to full health (depending on what's in front of the attack).**~~ This gives the pyro another taunt kill, but more useful is it's repairing ability. Often as a pyro the best course of action is killing / chasing after a spy and letting the engineer take care of the sapper. The only times when the homewrecker is useful is if the engineer is dead or is using a jag. If the engineer is dead than it doesn't matter if the sapper is removed, the gun is likely to fall anyway. Being unable to repair or wrangle a sentry for 15+ seconds is a death sentence. This small ability would boost the power of the homewrecker on support by a substantial margin. The pyro will also have to pay however much damage he repaired from his own ammo reserves, to prevent spaming. 2. ~~**Immune to knockback while active**~~ ~~**+50% damage resistance to sentry fire while active**~~ ~~*+75% damage taken from all other sources while active*~~ This makes the homewrecker better at taking out sentries. While active he can survive 2.5 seconds of direct sentry fire. If he's being healed he can survive over 6 seconds! Of course this comes at the cost of him only having 100 effective health to all other attacks. Two shotgun shells, two body shots, a rocket, or a pill are all it takes to gib them. This is best used when ubered, since the damage vulnerability is irrelevant. I considered making the total resistance to knockback only apply to sentries, but I figured that taking almost double damage from an attack is harsh enough to discourage pyros from using this for non building combat."

Things like the Sandvich, Phlogistinator, and scout sodas. The banners have this feature too, but to a lesser degree of vulnerability. Partner taunts exist in the game, so what if the two were mixed? Here are two ideas for weapons that, when used by the equipped player, will have him offer a taunt. The familiar icon will appear, but a different color to help clarify that it affects gameplay. Anyone on his team (or enemy team if we want to allow friendlies) can complete the taunt to receive the benefit. **First Aid Kit** ~~**Fire: offer to patch up a teammate**~~ ~~**If the teammate is at full health they will instead use it on you**~~ I was thinking about who this would fit the best on, but can't come up with a good answer. The Heavy, Demo, Medic, and Engineer wouldn't use this, as they either have better healing options or really powerful secondaries. It's not in flavor for spy, but I could imagine scout, soldier, pyro, and sniper all bringing a first aid kit to the battlefield. Maybe it could be the first all class weapon. Stats: Taunt takes just as long as the Sandvich taunt (4.3 seconds) Taunt will replenish 75% of the targets health over the course of the taunt (will not overheal) First aid kit takes 30 seconds to regenerate but it is instantly regenerated by picking up a health kit at full health (identical to Sandvich). Visually inspired by the first aid kits in left 4 dead. **Inflammable Battle Lubricant** *Pyro secondary* ~~The Pyro excitedly holds out a jerry can of gasoline and invites another merc to be doused in fumes~~ ~~**Affected player gains a (whip) speed boost while they are on fire**~~ ~~*Lights the affected player on fire (afterburn deals 2 damage per half second for ten seconds, total of 40 damage)*~~ ~~*Speed boost ends immediately if the player is extinguished*~~ ~~Hopefully your teammates know that inflammable and flammable mean the same thing~~ The effect is most similar to release GRU, but that was broken because you could put the gloves away while doing bunny hops to avoid damage. You are still able to be extinguished by anyone on your team, which will cancel the speed boost. On the plus side if you get set on fire by enemy pyros you could theoretically keep your speed boost forever. Visually the affected player will have noticeable sparks coming off of his afterburn and the whip speed boost lines. Pyros are not able to be set on fire, but they probably would appreciate the effort nonetheless. I considered having it grant fire resistance or immunity to flare crits, but making pyro the counter to pyro isn't the best design. What are your ideas for partner taunt weapons? It's untapped design space that I haven't heard anyone mention."

Melee weapons aren't used much by any classes in general, but with Heavy and Pyro in particular, there is very little reason to use your melee instead of your primary, so in that way, their stock melee weapons are underpowered compared to the other classes. Heavy has the additional downside of being a very slow class - unless the enemy is also using melee, it's very hard even to hit the enemy. However, I'm ignoring him in this post because: - Using his primary reduces his speed even more, so there COULD be some situations where he needs the slight extra mobility but still needs to deal close-range damage. - He has the Buffalo Steak, which, while mostly a joke weapon, does give him a way to use his melees. - Heavy also has two utility-focused melees (GRU and FoS). ------ Out of all of Pyro's melees, there is only one true ""Utility"" unlock, i.e. that does not gain some enhanced on-hit effect - the Homewrecker. Some of the other melees are utility-focused, but all of them have some bonus to the attack, which suggests that they are at least partly designed to be actively used as melee weapons. However, unlocks are supposed to act as sidegrades when compared to the stock weapon, and since the stock fire axe is almost useless for Pyro, any unlockable weapon that is supposed to be used directly is also underpowered. Just for some numbers - the Fire Axe deals 65 damage every 0.8s - or about 81 DPS. The Flamethrower deals roughly 115 DPS (4.8-6.8 per particle, 23 particles a second). Maybe you think the enemy is on low health, and want to finish them off in a single hit? Even so, it takes 0.5s to switch weapons, during which time you could have dealt another 50-60 damage just by using your primary. ~~The Degreaser is necessary to give the melee unlocks ANY viability~~ Switching to melee will almost never be worth it, unless you are using the Degreaser. In my opinion, this is bad design - the Degreaser should ENHANCE the strength of your secondary/melee weapons, not be a REQUIREMENT for using them at all. Melee weapons that encourage active/direct use should be viable even if you're using the stock Flame Thrower. (Same goes for the Heavy's Buffalo Steak, really.) In fact, since the Flame Thrower overshadows the Fire Axe's role so much, it's probably better to balance melee unlocks against the Flame Thrower - taking into account that they're not ranged, don't have airblast, and only hit a single target per swing. As for specific weapons: **The Powerjack** By far, the most widely used of the Pyro melees. Has a passive downside for two active upsides, although the increased run speed is fairly passive (i.e. you can get a lot of use out of it even if you don't use the weapon directly) so it's not too badly designed. The health-on-kill is also alright - even though it's been reduced a lot, gaining health is still something that the Pyro can't do with his Primary, so there is a reason to use it to finish an enemy off. **The Backscratcher** This one's also alright, because again, it's mostly a utility weapon. The increased damage is fairly useless, but still occasionally comes in handy. **The Neon-Annihilator** Useful if there's a lot of water on the map, but useless on dry maps. It's like the Sun-on-a-Stick, but worse. Afterburn is at least fairly common, but relying on two unlockable secondary weapons (or the Sydney Sleeper, I guess), both with long recharge rates, in order to deal damage, is just pointless unless you're playing with a friend. **The Third Degree** The effect seems really original... but... it was hardly used before it got nerfed - even when it was a straight upgrade from stock (which again shows how underpowered Stock is, and how inappropriate it is to use the Fire Axe as a baseline for balancing sidegrades...). **The SVF** Awful weapon. The Fire Axe is weak because it does nothing that the Flame Thrower can't do - the SVF takes it a step further. The weapon looks really neat, so it would be nice if it could be reworked into something useable outside of Degroot. (I've previously suggested that it could apply a marked-for-death or fire/afterburn vulnerability debuff to the target.) **The Axtinguisher** I used to love the Axtinguisher - right back when it dealt full crits to burning players. Unfortunately, it hurts to say it but I've realised that this weapon is just awfully designed. The weapon's gimmick is that it deals extra damage to burning players... but for a Pyro, that means every enemy except other Pyros, so reduced damage on non-burning targets isn't much of a penalty at all. It was overpowered in its old state, but in order for it to be at all useful, it needs to be able to deal enough DPS so that there's a reason to stop using the Flame Thrower and wait 0.5 seconds before using it (not to mention waiting another 0.5 seconds if you need to switch back...). If its gimmick is just increased damage, then there isn't much of a middle ground between useless and OP. In its current state, it takes even longer to switch, and although it full-crits, the damage penalty applies even to burning players. So, unless you just happen to have it out when a burning player walks by, it's still only viable at all when paired with the Degreaser (and even then it's only mediocre). Here is my own rework of the Axtinguisher: ~~**Minicrits burning players**~~ ~~**On hit: Gain 40% Damage resistance for 1 second**~~ ~~*-20% Attack Speed*~~ ~~*-50% Damage vs non-burning players*~~ Instead of dealing full crits, the weapon only minicrits, and only attacks once every 0.96s, so it takes almost 3 seconds to take down a fully-healed Heavy (almost twice as long as with the old Axtinguisher). However, you now receive a large damage resistance as long as you keep hitting the enemy, so you can keep hacking away without becoming completely exposed and vulnerable yourself. ---------- Anyway, that pretty much sums it up. This is a huge long post, and is mainly ranting, so I doubt many people will even read it. If you do, thanks very much! For anyone who doesn't have that sort of spare time, here it is in short: **TL;DR** - Whereas most classes find use for their melees in some situations, there is NEVER a situation where it's better for a Pyro to use his melee (unless he's just completely run out of Ammo) - The Degreaser gives Melee weapons some viability, but since a lot of Pyro's Melee unlocks have some on-hit benefit or increased damage, they shouldn't require the Degreaser to be viable - using it should just ENHANCE secondary/melee viability. - Since the Flame Thrower overshadows the Fire Axe in every situation (except when out of ammo, or for random crits), any melee unlock that is designed to be used in preference to the Flame Thrower (i.e. any Non-Utility Melee), should either have a benefit that cannot be performed by the Flame Thrower, or deal very high burst damage in a situational way. (Also, take into account that not only does the Flamer have higher DPS, but is also ranged, deals afterburn, can reflect, can hit multiple targets at once, and also that without the Degreaser, there is a 0.5 second switch time between attacks.) - Most of Pyro's unlocks encourage using the weapon actively, at least partially, but almost all of the active bonuses are either too situational or just completely useless, since using the Flamer is almost always better."

Is the scout going to annoy the soldier by jumping around, avoiding all explosive radiuses? Well, but this way you have to be really chary because at the first mistake you're going to get more damage than usual. This will imho probably let this weapon become less viable (and it's a good thing, currently it's the most OP melee for scout) and more balanced for competitive game. Sorry for my banal explanation and my bad english, i just want to know what do you think about this balance and why it couldn't be applied. "

It discourages roaming - you will lose any fights with other Pyros, and take even more damage from Det/Scorch jumping, and you won't be able to move around the map nearly so fast. But, if you're playing close to your Engineer, you won't need that movement speed so much anyway (apart from chasing down Spies), and your team/Sentry will protect you from enemy Pyros. I wanted to add some other way for Pyro to help teammates directly - I thought about giving THEM health back when they're extinguished by this weapon, but that would discourage enemies to use Pyro at all. NB - I'm not saying roaming as Pyro is bad, or that Pybro should ALWAYS be the way to play Pyro, but this flamer will give you some nice bonuses if you're already planning to play close to your team."

This small buff of ~~**+15% faster move speed on wearer**~~ will make it a very good sidegrade to the stock Kukri as you can use that increased movement speed to get to the front lines quicker, escaping a sticky situation or to get an easy crit kill with the Jarate or Cleaners Carbine that you previously couldn't reach but of course, you take more damage from everything when you have the weapon active, basically making it the Powerjack for the Sniper. --- If there are any suggestions for changes to these stats that seem to be OP, UP or just need a slight change, let me know in the comments below and I will consider changing some of them if I think they are good enough."

Currently, the situation of Diamondback vs Ambassador is similar to the situation of the Phlogistinator vs Backburner. My new design of the Diamondback features an ability called ""Graviton"". Graviton takes 3 buildings destroyed, 3 backstabs, or a combination of these, to be built up. It is deployed by pressing Secondary attack while the Diamondback is active. This means that the Invis Watch will not activate if your Diamondback is deployed. Graviton lasts for 10 seconds. Graviton increases the mass of your bullets dramatically. After pressing secondary fire, primary fire can be used to drag you in the direction of the bullet (but not enemies). This can be used to get you up onto really high ledges, which normally few classes can reach. It would also mean that you would be able to suspend yourself against walls or ceilings (and the skybox, which would be useful for getting onto the ledges), but you would fall after the 10 seconds are up. Graviton can also pull you to the ground if you are airborne, or it can pull you horizontally. The speed at which Graviton pulls you is the same speed that the Spy swims (85%). While being pulled by Graviton, the Spy can move his camera view around. The Diamondback deals no damage; it is purely for moving around while under Graviton. The function times of the Diamondback are identical to the current one. This means that it has a clip and an ammo supply, among other things. While under Graviton, you take 20% extra damage from all sources and you cannot be disguised or invisible. Activating Graviton will immediately cause you to stop being invisible and to lose your disguise. ____________________ Original: **The Diamondback** *Level 5 Revolver* ~~**Gives one guaranteed critical hit for each building destroyed with your sapper attached or backstab kill**~~ ~~*-15% damage penalty*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~"

This can assist in Bushwacka (or any melee) combos. Let's face it, the Cleaner's Carbine's not very popular, and one reason is because it's pretty much useless when paired with the primary. It only really helps out your melee damage or the damage of the weapon itself. This can make it have some appeal over Jarate or the SMG (I don't want it to be a straight upgrade, though). Note that the mini-crits will only really bring up the damage to the normal amount of the Stock SMG. Notes: I reduced the firing speed penalty from 25% to 20%. I removed the clip size penalty. I lowered the damage by 25%.

With this weapon, you'll be able to render entire chokepoints unpassable or entire objectives unobtainable for 10 seconds at a time. However, you'll have to get a kill to do this. It is considerably difficult to do this, as your damage is very low with this weapon. However, using the Sniper Rifle to do the bulk of the damage and switching to the Laughing Matter for the kill can work. To make sure kills are still difficult, the weapon deploys slower. Also, after you finish taunting, you can't switch to your primary until your damage reflection phase is over. However, you can actually continue to fire the weapon itself while reflecting damage, and you can continue the chain if you get lucky.

With Miniguns and Flame Throwers, half of the ammo capacity is seen as the clip ammo capacity, so each Lorikeet bullet will restore 20 ammo. Also, if a Medic or Spy has their Medi Gun or Knife out, respectively, they will lose their Syringe Gun and Revolver ammo, respectively, but if the other way around, they won't lose anything. With the ammunition removal ability, even if the enemy already has full reserve ammo, the clip ammo can still be moved there, and will effectively give them extra reserve ammo. This means that ammunition isn't removed, it's just stockpiled. They are forced to reload their weapon after switching to it, but don't actually lose any ammo. This can waste a varying amount of time, depending on what weapon the enemy is using, but in general, it will only waste around 3 seconds. For Demomen especially, the downside of losing all of the clip ammo of their undeployed weapon is extremely devastating. (Particle effects will probably have to be in place for anyone whose ammo has been restocked or stockpiled.)

URL I was doubtful before, but now, far, far more so. Gonna limit my idea sharing to here (and probably r/truetf2) from now on :P This is a long list. Sorry in advance. **Afterburn changes** ~~**Invisible heat meter now added**~~ ~~**Heat meter goes up by 10 points per second while flames are on target (checking each 0.1s to see if user was hit by a flame particle in the past 0.1s, and adds 1 if true.

If it is a positive number (as in, the new AB would go out sooner), the new AB is applied for that shortened amount of time (If a person has burned for 9s of max Ab and gets hit with lvl 1 AB, they then take (5-1)=4s of lvl 1 AB after the lvl 3 ends)**~~ ~~**Duration of all AB levels halved by throwable liquids and airblast. Fully extinguished by water, and heals act for 6 heat points per second (So 3.3s of healing puts out max AB)**~~ ~~*remove 25% less heal on burners. Just not necessary.*~~ Afterburn is now far more threatening, but a bit more difficult to apply if you don't know what you are doing. **Flame thrower changes!** ~~**Flame thrower spread is now about 50% tighter.**~~ ~~*10% movement speed in the direction the player is firing the flame thrower (including downward or upward, which can either partially counteract or assist gravity). Reduced to 5% horizontally if crouching on the ground*~~ ~~**Remove crit damage falloff. Just why?**~~ Ok, so punishes w+m1 a little bit (but not considerably much). Rewards less spammy use of flames and encourages more tactical use (I am imagining holding m1 to get 100% speed while retreating instead of 90 or down to try and float between longer ledges) **Airblast changes. Don't kill me till you've read the rest** ~~*Airblasted rockets sputter out after 2s, becoming affected by gravity and detonating on impact with the ground.*~~ ~~**Airblasted pipes stick the ground like iron bomber pills for more reliable grenade jumping and not having to dodge a derpy pill rolling around crazily.**~~ ~~**No self mini crit dmg from reflected pills (bug I think but still)**~~ ~~*Pipes reset to a 2s fuse upon reflect.*~~ ~~*Players have full strafe control while air blasted, but lose momentum from before the blast*~~ Don't lose it. This forces pyro to be more careful, and pin his targets by catching them off guard. Even then, strafing out of if is pretty hard when you see it coming. To prevent the automatic m2,2,m1 reflexes that aren't so much skill as they are reflexes. Pyro has a lot more potential, and removing stun locks from the arblast all together makes it less annoying and forces a bit more skill from the pyro. Pyro can still reflect rockets and pipes for dmg, but he can't get mini crits from across the map from rockets. The biggest change IMO: *2 Grenade types added to pyro. Pressure and gasoline grenades.* **Grenades** ~~**Takes the 3rd weapon slot. Melee is pushed to 4th. Pick again to switch nades (like in cs:go)**~~ *Ammo count: 4* **Pressure grenade** ~~**Acts as an arblast for weakening Ab on teammates. Throws you up to 10 feet in the air and up to 20 feet away.

The Claid was always something of the mobility blade, allowing for longer charges in exchange for a damage vulnerability while active, before becoming the health+charge restorer it currently is. To get back to that route a bit, I've considered again changing the stats, this time to give the Claid a passive movement speed boost and damage vulnerability - more fragility for more mobility. The weapon can also deal random crits now, similar to the Skullcutter (though it lacks its damage output). Nothing too complex beyond the usual sword stats; just a simple weapon that lets you push the Demo into a somewhat more mobile, if easier to kill, class. (Also, though I'm still trying to find numbers on this, but the Demoman's movement speed seems to affect the distance covered by the shield charges (as demonstrated by the Skullcutter). Going by that logic, perhaps this CLaid would also increase the distance covered by shield charges once again, even if in a slightly different fashion). "

This is one big nerf, one small buff, and two medium buffs. I'm very excited about this rework. Buffalo Steak Sandvich is [banned in competitive play](URL and [not used very much in pubs.](URL This rework fixes both these key problems. Steak is banned in competitive because its flat speed boost allows Heavy to be ran to mid on time, for no downside other than losing his Shotgun. Heavy is very hard to kill, easy to kill with, and (subjectively) boring to play as and watch be played; both teams are forced to run a Heavy when BSS is allowed, and they don't like this. And in pubs, BSS sees little use because (according to other Heavies I've talked to, and from my own experience) it's so binary and easily shut down. If the enemy is faster than you or too far away, you're dead and there's almost nothing you can do about it. If the enemy is within your range and doesn't have the damage to kill you first, they're dead. The second situation occurs less than the first. Here's where my rework comes in. If taking damage triggered the speed boost, it could no longer be used to run to mid in comp; and in pubs, this would give the enemy a choice- ""do I attack Heavy to try and kill him, and risk him becoming super fast and hitting me in the face; or do I leave him alone, and escape or wait for my allies?"" This Choice means Counterplay For The Enemy Gamer, and the game becomes more fun. It's sort of like the Incredible Hulk: ""You wouldn't like Heavy when he's angry."" On Heavy's end, skilled Steak users can intentionally absorb enemy attacks to gain speed boosts, then dodge around their enemies to avoid taking more damage than is necessary. The removal of the damage vulnerability and addition of a heal will give Heavy greatly improved survivability during steak-fueled rage-fests. The healing would be 75 total, making the weapon more useful in both pubs and comp without superseding the Sandvich (due to having 1/4 the healing of Sandvich and locking the user to melee for 15s). This change would in theory have manifold benefits-- allow BSS to be unbanned in competitive, make BSS become used more in pubs, make it more fun to play against/watch, work better with the theme of the weapon, and open up a wide variety of melee unlocks to be used more often on Heavy (thus making him more fun to play). All the ""Demoknight""-like Heavy loadouts that would ensue: Bruiser/Saint/Chef/Hippie/Freedom/Mortal Kombat/Angry Cameraman/Meat-Beating/Wack-A-Mole/Thomas the Tank/Edgy Heavy (Steak+Fists and reskins) Heavyweight Champion (Steak+Killing Gloves of Boxing) Speed Demon (Steak+Gloves of Running Urgently) Hungry Bear (Steak+Warrior's Spirit) Soviet Main Battle Tank Heavy (Steak+Fists of Steel) (hit his weak point for Massive Damage!)

492,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[IG] &lt;MAKE PYRO GREAT AGAIN 2&gt;,15,5pl9k5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/5pl9k5/ig_make_pyro_great_again_2/,2017-01-23 12:24:47,"&gt;Didn't we already do this? Yes, but let's do it again anyways. &amp;nbsp; With an incoming Pyro overhaul, I decided it's time to tweak some of the Pyro changes I've suggested before. Whereas [&lt;MAKE PYRO GREAT AGAIN&gt;](URL was based mostly on Highlander and Pub Pyro playstyle tweaks, this post focuses on making Pyro a more viable class in 6v6 gameplay. I believe that Pyro is already a viable class at the pub level and many new players complain of the class being 'W+M1 too strong' so buffing the class all-around will make pubs into a nightmare and W+M1 Pyros will plague the game moreso than before. The challenge here is to make Pyro more viable in 6v6 gameplay without buffing W+M1 or making him any stronger in the hands of a new player. &amp;nbsp; *** &amp;nbsp; **AFTERBURN** Afterburn is now split up into 5 'stages'. Each stage lasts 4 seconds and regresses to the stage below it afterwards, barring stage 1 which simply extinguishes when it's timer runs out. This means each stage will hit a total of 8 times (once every half-second, for four seconds) assuming nothing happens to stop it. Every stage deals twice as much damage as the stage below it, starting at 1 for level 1 afterburn. Visually, these stages progress from Smoking &gt; Small Red Flames &gt; (normal) &gt; Orange Flames &gt; White/Blue Flames. The same visual effects are shown around the outside of the burning player's screen, increasing in intensity based on the Afterburn Level (never so much as to block view substantially.) Mini-crits and critical hits from Afterburn-inducing weapons inflict 1 more Afterburn Level than normal. Indirect hits from Flare Gun-type secondaries inflict 1 less Afterburn Level than normal. These stack with each other, so an indirect mini-crit from the Detonator or Scorch Shot will inflict the regular level of afterburn. Afterburn levels are lowered by various sources. Picking up a health kit will lower the Afterburn Level by 2, 3 or 4 depending on the size of the health kit. Jarate, Mad Milk and Airblasts lower Afterburn Level by 3. Activating a Dead Ringer lowers Afterburn Level by 3. Being submerged in water, activating the Spycicle, or touching a resupply cabinet will lower the Afterburn Level by 5. Being cloaked or being healed by a Dispenser, Medigun or Payload will increase the rate at which afterburn decreases by 100%. Fire Resistance increases the rate at which afterburn counts down by 100% (not multiplicative), this applies to active Fire Resistances, not damage resistance like the Battalion's Backup or passive resistances such as the Charge 'n' Targe. Flamethrowers will start out at Level 1 Afterburn, increasing to their normal Level as the exposure to fire is longer. A single puff of flame will only inflict Level 1 Afterburn, but the level increases by 1 for every 8 unique flame particles that hit afterwards (the flamethrower shoots 23 particles of fire per second). It takes roughly 0.75 seconds for the Flamethrower to reach it's full Afterburn Level (3). Lower Afterburn Levels will reset the timer on higher levels, but will not increase or decrease the level itself. **LEVEL 1** ~~**Deals 1 damage per hit. (8 over 4 seconds)**~~ ~~Restores 10 ammo when extinguished.~~ ~~Inflicted by Level 2 Afterburn.~~ **LEVEL 2** ~~**Deals 2 damage per hit. (16 over 4 seconds, 24 over 8 seconds)**~~ ~~Reduces healing from Medigun sources by 10%. Restores 20 ammo when extinguished.~~ ~~Inflicted by Degreaser, Detonator, Flare Gun, Manmelter, Scorch Shot, Level 3 Afterburn.~~ **LEVEL 3** ~~**Deals 4 damage per hit. (32 over 4 seconds, 56 over 12 seconds)**~~ ~~Reduces healing from Medigun sources by 20%. Restores 30 ammo when extinguished.~~ ~~Inflicted by Flame Thrower, Backburner, Phlogistonator, Level 4 Afterburn.~~ **LEVEL 4** ~~**Deals 8 damage per hit. (64 over 4 seconds, 120 over 16 seconds)**~~ ~~Reduces healing from Medigun sources by 30%. Restores 30 ammo when extinguished.~~ ~~Inflicted by Sharpened Volcano Fragment, Level 5 Afterburn.~~ **LEVEL 5** ~~**Deals 16 damage per hit. (128 over 4 seconds, 248 over 20 seconds)**~~ ~~Reduces healing from Medigun sources by 40%. Restores 30 ammo when extinguished.~~ This is based off of /u/TheSnowballofCobalt 's suggestion about afterburn changes [seen here.](URL &amp;nbsp; *** &amp;nbsp; **AIRBLAST** ~~**Knocking back an enemy with airblast boosts your weapon switch speed by 40% for 0.8 seconds.**~~ This lets any of Pyro's flamethrowers be used for combos, rather than only the Degreaser. Boosting his weapon switch speed after airblasting an enemy lets the Pyro become more dangerous in close range engagements without buffing the class all around. It also does nothing to help the Pyro become more reactive when using a W+M1 playstyle, meaning he is only stronger when he engages fights, but weaker when the enemy hits first. ~~**Reflected projectiles have their fuse times reset.**~~ This helps Pyro become more of a Demoman counter, as resetting the arm time of reflected stickybombs means you can protect your team from them and don't need to worry about a reflected stickybomb blowing up in your face. A Pyro is better at shutting down area denial like grenade spam and sticky traps by disabling the stickies while you're pushing the bombs back. ~~**Compression Blasts can remove 'wet' debuffs from allies.**~~ ~~Extinguishing allies now restores ammo rather than health.~~ I never understood why this was that big of a deal for Pyro, as he typically has two roles. Spychecking and reflecting spam near the combo (where you have a Medic, Dispenser, or both) and flanking, (where you are almost always alone, and thus won't have any teammates to extinguish). With afterburn returning ammo instead of health, Pyros who extinguish allies will return most of the ammo used to extinguish them, potentially more. This way a Pyro will never have to concern himself with figuring out if it's worth using up ammo to support your team. ~~Airblasts now push enemies away from the origin of the airblast, rather than in the direction the Pyro is looking.~~ Airblasts also push players further the closer they are to the airblast's origin, rather than a set amount back. Airblasting does not reset momentum, so you will move somewhat in the same direction you were moving before being airblast. This means that a skilled player will be able to more easily avoid M2-spam, but a skilled Pyro will also have more control over the direction in which the enemy is knocked back. &amp;nbsp; *** &amp;nbsp; **AIRBLAST DASHES** ~~**Airblasting while airborne will perform an 'Airblast Dash'.**~~ ~~*This can only be performed once per jump, reset when the Pyro touches the ground again.*~~ This knockback will launch you up to 196 hammer units vertically. If used at the peak of your jump, you will reach a total height of 268 hammer units (the minimum height needed to take fall damage is 269). The Airblast Dash maintains your horizontal (x,z) momentum and propels you upwards, so it can't be used to gain very much speed, but it will let the Pyro reach higher ground with ease. This is my idea for letting the Pyro gain extra mobility without turning him into a cheap copy of Scout or Soldier. Since Airblast Dashes are mostly vertical height you won't be able to chase down Scouts by jumping after them, but you can reach high ground with ease and ambush people from above. When combined with the increased control Pyros have over the direction and force of their airblast knockback, the Pyro now has a role of controlling high ground during pushes and controlling flanks during downtime. &amp;nbsp; *** &amp;nbsp; **FLARE GUNS** ~~**Projectile speed increased 20%**~~ ~~**Base damage increased to 35.**~~ Flare gun projectiles now move at 2400hu/s instead of 2000hu/s. This is partially to compensate for the decreased afterburn damage they deal and partially to compensate for flare punch combos being somewhat more difficult to pull off. Flare Guns will still be outclassed at mid-range by the Shotgun due to their lack of burst damage, but this helps make the weapons into stronger combo tools for the Pyro who likes to initiate fights. **PYRO** ~~**30% less self-damage taken**~~ This decrease in self-damage works the same way that Soldier and Demoman's self-resists do. You take less self-damage from all sources unless that source also damages an enemy, in which case you take full damage. The resistance does not reduce the knockback you receive from these sources so jumping with reflected projectiles as well as flare jumping will still work just fine. **BACKBURNER** ~~**+100% crits from behind**~~ ~~**+100% compression blast knockback from behind**~~ ~~**+15% jump height on wearer**~~ ~~*+150% slower airblast firing speed*~~ ~~*+25% airblast cost*~~ Fitting the role of the 'flanking flamethrower' the Backburner becomes stronger at ambushing enemies by increasing the knockback against them when the increased damage won't do. Your jump height is also passively increased to assist the user in reaching areas they couldn't before and increasing the distance your flare jumps will take you without forcing the user to use the Detonator in order to take advantage of this. The penalties are increased airblast cost (25 ammo instead of 20 ammo) and longer time between airblasting (1.85sec instead of 0.75sec). This lets the Pyro continue to support his teammates by extinguishing them as well as allowing the Pyro to continue using your Airblast Dash for mobility but for long sustained fights you'll begin to suffer more greatly. **DEGREASER** ~~**Weapon switch speed boosts are 50% stronger and last twice as long**~~ ~~**Airblasting enemies inflicts Level 1 Afterburn**~~ ~~*-1 Afterburn Level on flames*~~ ~~*-10% damage*~~ Fitting the role of the 'combo flamethrower' the Degreaser becomes stronger at hitting combos with your secondary and melee weapons by igniting them on airblast and having stronger switch speed boosts that last longer than before (60% faster weapon switch speed for 1.6 seconds), enough time to switch to your Flare Gun, fire and shot, then finish the enemy off with your melee weapon. The decreased direct damage as well as the weaken Afterburn Level from this weapon means that you won't be doing too much work with just your primary weapon. Since crits from Flare Guns deal stronger afterburn, you'll be making up for this weapons downsides if you use it properly. **PHLOGISTONATOR** ~~**Build 'Mmmph' by dealing fire damage**~~ ~~**Alt-Fire on full 'Mmmph': Taunt to gain 50 health and gain crits for 10 seconds**~~ ~~**Invulnerable while activating Mmmph**~~ ~~Airblast destroys projectiles~~ ~~*-100% airblast knockback vs enemy players*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ Finally, the Phlogistonator gains the ability to airblast. The alt-fire however does not reflect projectiles, but destroys them instead. It is also unable to knock back enemies, so you won't be able to combo with it well. It becomes a weapon for flanking and crowd control, most fitting the role the Pyro was originally intended to play (however successful that was). **DETONATOR** ~~**100% mini-crits vs burning players**~~ ~~*-25% damage penalty*~~ ~~Alt-Fire: Detonate flare.~~ ~~This weapon will reload automatically when not active.~~ Removing the self-damage from the Detonator also reduces the knockback you receive from it. With Pyro being able to extend his jump with Airblast Dashing, detonator jumping would become much more powerful as it allows the Pyro to gain a temporary horizontal speed boost. So while the detonator jump won't launch you as far or fast, it will still be a 'triple jump' of a sort for the Pyro and still be the best secondary weapon for gaining mobility. **FLARE GUN** ~~**100% critical hits vs burning players**~~ ~~This weapon will reload automatically when not active.~~ **MANMELTER** ~~**+25% projectile speed**~~ ~~**Does not require ammo**~~ ~~**Alt-Fire: Extinguish teammates to gain guaranteed critical hits**~~ ~~**Burning enemy deaths store one critical hit.**~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ The projectile speed boost has been lowered from 50% to 25%, but because of the overall increase to flare speed the speed is still the same as before (3000hu/s). The Manmelter now gains guaranteed crits from assists and afterburn kills, so it no longer relies on enemy Pyros in order to work effectively. **SCORCH SHOT** ~~**100% mini-crits vs burning players**~~ ~~**Flare knocks back target on hit and explodes when it hits the ground.**~~ ~~**Increased knockback on burning players**~~ ~~*-35% damage penalty*~~ ~~This weapon will reload automatically when not active.~~ **AXTINGUISHER** ~~**100% critical hits against burning players**~~ ~~**+10% damage per Afterburn Level on enemy**~~ ~~*-25% damage penalty*~~ ~~*Hitting enemies extinguishes 3 levels of afterburn*~~ ~~*-75% holster speed*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ This change, combined with the boosted switch speed from airblasting makes the Axtinguisher more powerful, but also more skill indexed. The Axetinguisher's damage being based on Afterburn Level means that quick combos with the Degreaser will deal less damage (161) but as you expose the enemy to more fire damage, the damage increases (up to 190 damage at Level 3 Afterburn). Slower holstering speed and extinguishing Afterburn Levels on hit means that you have to use this weapon as a finisher, or else you risk being very vulnerable to incoming damage. **BACKSCRATCHER** ~~**+50% health from packs on wearer**~~ ~~*-75% health from healers on wearer*~~ Removed the increased damage so it doesn't as strongly outclass the stock Fire Axe. **HOMEWRECKER** ~~**+100% damage vs buildings**~~ ~~**+75% resistance to knockback while deployed**~~ ~~**Damage removes Sappers**~~ ~~*-25% damage vs players*~~ Added a resistance to push force so an Ubered Pyro can take out a Sentry nest without getting pushed into the skybox. It also gives the Homewrecker a purpose when there are no Engineers in the server. **NEON ANNIHILATOR** ~~**Damage removes Sappers**~~ ~~**Damaging Sappers fills a Charge meter.**~~ ~~**Alt-Fire on full Charge: Taunt to triple melee swing speed for 10 seconds.**~~ ~~*-20% damage penalty*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ The charge meter fills 1/8th for every Sapper you hit and is not based off damage so breaking a Sapper alongside an Engineer will be just as rewarding as breaking one by yourself. This is enough so unsapping an entire nest is enough to fully charge the meter. Once charged, tripling melee swing speed allows you to destroy Sappers incredibly quickly (faster than the Homewrecker) or you can use it to take down an enemy or two or three. The faster melee swing speed will also stack with criticals, making the Neon Annihilator deal 591DPS under specific circumstances. This feature was added in place of the crits against wet players as it was weird to have a weapon that worked best on small areas of a handful of maps, or when used alongside two weapons, one of which gives you mini-crits anyways, the other of which is banned in 6s. **POWERJACK** ~~**While deployed:**~~ ~~**15% faster move speed on wearer**~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ ~~*-35% damage penalty*~~ Removed the health gain on kill in place of decreased damage. The Powerjack is still a weapon for increasing mobility and still fills that role, but is worse for self-defense. Because Pyro's mobility is now based on Primary-weapon Airblast Dashing Pyros will rely less on their melees for moving faster. **SHARPENED VOLCANO FRAGMENT** ~~**On hit: Target is engulfed in flames (Level 4 afterburn)**~~ ~~*-50% damage penalty*~~ The Sharpened Volcano Fragment is the only way for a Pyro to inflict Level 5 Afterburn and can inflict levels higher than 4 consistently. What you trade in damage, you make up for in powerful afterburn that can almost completely shutdown a Medic's healing. This works as a reverse-Axetinguisher, as the Axetinguisher is a finisher weapon to use against low-health enemies and the Sharpened Volcano Fragment is more for initiator against high-health enemies. **THIRD DEGREE** ~~**All players connected via Medigun beams are hit**~~ ~~Damage dealt scales with enemy health~~ *Damage scales between 33 damage at 50% health or below to 98 damage at 150% health or above.* This stops the Third Degree from being a straight upgrade to the stock Fire Axe without outright nerfing it. It has a unique function in dealing large amounts of damage to Medics who are pocketing classes but is terrible on it's own as a finisher. &amp;nbsp; *** &amp;nbsp; **NOT PYRO** &amp;nbsp; **MAD MILK** ~~**Players heal 60% of the damage done to an enemy covered with milk.**~~ ~~**Can be used to extinguish fires.**~~ ~~**Extinguishing allies refills 10% of the meter per afterburn level.**~~ Better skill-indexing for extinguishing allies. Scouts are more rewarded for reacting quickly to burning allies or extinguishing multiple allies at once. **SUN-ON-A-STICK** ~~**100% critical hit vs burning players**~~ ~~**-50% Afterburn damage taken while deployed**~~ ~~*-25% damage penalty*~~ The Sun-on-a-Stick no longer blocks damage from Flare Guns or direct Flamethrower damage, but is better at blocking damage from Afterburn. **COW MANGLER 5000** ~~**Does not consume ammo**~~ ~~**Alt-fire: Fire a charged shot that deals mini-crits and disables buildings**~~ ~~*-80% damage to buildings*~~ ~~*Cannot be crit-boosted*~~ Removed the afterburn from the charged shot so Soldiers can't shut down pockets with spam. **HUO-LONG HEATER** ~~**While spun-up: Creates a ring of fire inflicting Level 2 Afterburn to nearby enemies**~~ ~~**Sustained fire inflicts Level 1 Afterburn**~~ ~~*Consumes 6 additional ammo per second*~~ Since low-level Afterburn isn't too powerful, the Huo-Long by itself won't do too much work over the Stock Minigun. But even low-level Afterburn can extend the timer on higher level Afterburns, so it encourages working together with a friendly Pyro and extending his Afterburn damage, as well as preventing Medics from extinguishing their allies, giving Heavy the edge in Heavy vs. Heavy fights. This replaces the flat increase in damage against burning enemies in order to better skill-index work for the Pyro. **JARATE** ~~**Coated enemies take mini-crits for up to 8 seconds.**~~ ~~**Can be used to extinguish fires.**~~ ~~**Extinguishing allies refills 10% of the meter per afterburn level.**~~ Better skill-indexing for extinguishing allies. Snipers are more rewarded for reacting quickly to burning allies or extinguishing multiple allies at once."

Just to be sure, I will also say that the idea has been tweaked for balance. ----------- **Team Player** *Level X Hybrid Medi Gun* ~~**Press your reload key to cycle through buff types.**~~ ~~**While healing, provides your patient with a constant buff based on selected type.**~~ ~~*While healing, wearer suffers a debuff based on selected type.*~~ HIDDEN: ~~""Mini-crits"": Causes patient to do mini-crits. Wearer is marked for death.~~ ~~""Defense"": Patient is immune to crits and is granted 35% damage resistance from all sources (except sentries, whose damage is instead halved). 35% damage vulnerability on wearer from all sources.~~ ~~""Healing"": 35% of damage done by patient is returned to them as health. -2 health drained on wearer per second. Cannot build Uber.~~ ~~Ubercharge: Wearer is surrounded in an aura that applies all 3 buffs simultaneously to all nearby allies. Automatically switches selected buff to ""Mini-crits"".~~ Medic got jealous of Soldier taking all the credit because he beat some man to death with a piece of meat from some guy named ""Fatty,"" and calling the soon-to-be corpse a hippie. He got so jealous in fact, he borrowed (stole) Soldier's backpacks, went into Engineer's private crafting bench with his consent (kicked the door open while Engie was working, grabbed the Texan, threw him out of the room, slammed the door behind him, and locked it tight), and brilliantly crafted a marvelous weapon of war (slapped a bunch of rubbish together until he got what he wanted). Satisfied with his ingenious invention, he proudly walked out (knocked the door down like an enraged gorilla with the unconscious Engineer still in front of it) and strolled to battle. ------------ The Team Player provides Medic with a new playstyle, favoring helping your patient (and ultimately the rest of your team) with buffs, at the expense of your well-being. While each buff can assist your patients in many ways, the debuffs require you to be cautious as they can accelerate your doom. The mini-crit buff obviously gives your patient a better damage output, ignoring damage falloff and can pair well with other weapons from other classes. The downside of course makes you prey to the same thing you are providing your patient. The defensive buff can help you counter sentries, Kritzkrieg Medics, and help your patients retreat. The downside makes you more vulnerable to damage, which can make it harder to survive. The difference between this downside and the previous buff's downside is that Medic gets hurt more easily from crits, yet doesn't suffer from damage falloff. Last but not least, the healing buff can allow your patient to survive longer through damaging your foes, but affects your regeneration ability and halts your Ubercharge from building. This is more of a last ditch move to keep your patient alive and effectively increases their healing rate. The inability to build Uber while this buff is selected is mainly to discourage Medics from relying solely on this buff. The Ubercharge also distinguishes the Team Player from the others by applying the effects in an aura, helping multiple players at once instead of helping at minimum a single patient. The mini-crit buff is selected automatically so that the debuff is nullified by the defensive buff, since the effects apply to Medic as well. Of course, in spite of the fact it can be applied to everyone on your team, it's still balanced by the fact you can be picked off by a Spy, Sniper, or a different player who has outflanked you and dealt sufficient damage to finish you off, though this sort of thing can be done to any Medic that isn't invulnerable to everything from stock. ---------- Provide feedback below, but please keep it civil."

Disclaimer: These will mostly be nerfes, but I personally think the nerfs are for the better. Also, I really love the concept of Deploy/Holster speed, so expect to see that. ~~Primary Weapons~~ **Force-a-Nature** *Level 10 Scattergun* ~~**+50% Faster Firing Speed**~~ ~~**Knockback on the target and shooter**~~ ~~**+20% bullets per shot**~~ ~~*This weapon deploys 30% slower*~~ - Nerf ~~*This weapon holsters 10% slower*~~ - Nerf ~~*-15% less accurate*~~ -Nerf ~~*-66% clip size*~~ ~~This weapon reloads its entire clip at once~~ Added three negative attributes, and removed one. Deploy/holster speed has been lowered, as well as an accuracy penalty. This will hopefully discourage players from using it, although it will still rewarding for experienced users, as it no longer has the damage penalty. I also think that target knockback should be based on how many pellets that hit. **Shortstop** *Level 1 Peppergun* ~~**+42% faster firing speed**~~ ~~**+100% damage increase**~~ ~~**Clip based reload**~~ ~~**Alt-fire: shoves an enemy away from you**~~ ~~**This weapon deploys 20% faster**~~ - Buff ~~*-50% fewer pellets per shot*~~ - Buff ~~*-34% clip size*~~ ~~*20% increased push force taken*~~ - Nerf These stats are taken from the wiki. This is one of the primary weapons I see least used in TF2. Giving it a couple of buffs would be nice to make it a more viable option. Faster deploy speed, and a couple more pellets per shot is IMO a fair upgrade. The downside is that the increased push force is a constant instead of when deployed. **Soda Popper** *Level 10 Scattergun* ~~**+40% faster firing speed**~~ - Nerf ~~**20% faster reload**~~ - Nerf ~~**On hit: build Hype**~~ ~~*This weapon deploys 20% slower*~~ - Nerf ~~*-15% damage decrease*~~ - Nerf ~~*-66% clip size*~~ This gun should be nerfed. It's close to being a straight upgrade to the normal Scattergun. The nerfs will make it tougher to utilize, having a tad slower firing and reload than the FaN, but a bit faster deploy speed. It's also more appropriate to pair it with the Crit-a-Cola with these changes. **Baby Face's Blaster** *Level 10 Scattergun* ~~**On hit: Builds Boost**~~ ~~**Run speed increased with Boost**~~ ~~**+30% more accurate**~~ - Buff ~~*-10% damage decrease*~~ - Nerf ~~*-30% slower move speed on wearer*~~ - Nerf ~~*-34% clip size*~~ ~~*Accuracy decreased with Boost*~~ - Nerf ~~*Boost reduced when air jumping*~~ ~~*Boost reduced when hit*~~ The way I'd like to change this is to rework how the Boost works. As you start with the speed of a Sniper/Engie to begin with, you are compensated with higher accuracy to boot, but as you start speeding up, it will become less accurate. Actual speed/accuracy percentages have not been calculated with this change in mind. **Back Scatter** *Level ## Scattergun* ~~**Minicrits targets when fired at their back and at close range**~~ ~~**Successful kills from behind grants a speed boost**~~ - Buff ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~*-34% clip size*~~ ~~*-20% slower firing speed*~~ - Nerf ~~*-20% less accurate*~~ I want the Back Scatter to be a bit more rewarding, yet more challenging to use. The small speed boost would be the same as if a Soldier whipped you with the Disciplinary Action. The slower firing speed, to me, sounds like a reasonable nerf to compensate the buff. *Now, over to* **Secondaries** These changes will either be complete reworks, or slight changes. **Crit-a-Cola** *Level 5 Lunchbox* ~~**When drunk, all damage dealt is minicrits**~~ ~~*When drunk, all damage taken is minicrits*~~ I just want the Crit-a-cola to have it's original stats back. It was well balanced, and made drinking it a huge risk/reward item. **Winger** *Level 15 Pistol* ~~**+20% more damage**~~ - Buff ~~**+25% Greater jump height**~~ - Buff ~~**This weapon deploys 15% faster**~~ - Buff ~~*-60% clip size*~~ ~~*All damage taken while in air is increased by 15%*~~ - Nerf Giving the Winger a higher damage output, and a constant increased height in jump would be what this weapon needs. As a nerf, you take more damage while airborne. **Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol** *Level 10 Pistol* ~~**+25% Overheal health**~~ - Buff ~~**Overheal goes away 40% slower**~~ - Buff ~~**Wearer never takes fall damage**~~ ~~*-30% slower healing rate*~~ - Nerf ~~*-25% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*-20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ I was thinking this would be a fun solution for the healing factor of with weapon. When equipped, Medics can give you a bigger health buff, and it lasts longer. The health you gain is based on the medigun used. The downsides are the usual ones as of now, but getting health from medics and dispensers are slower. *The last stretch* **Melee weapons** Honestly, I think most of Scouts melee weapons are fairly balanced, but only in certain situation. So I'll only go through those I think needs some changes. **Fan o'War** *Level 5 Gunbai* ~~**On hit: One target at a time is marked for death, causing all damage taken to be mini-crits for 15 seconds**~~ ~~**Crits whenever it would normally minicrit**~~ ~~**This weapon deploys 60% faster**~~ - Buff ~~*-80% damage penalty*~~ - Nerf ~~*This weapon holsters 100% slower*~~ - Nerf The thoughts behind this would be making the Fan o'War more of a last ditch attempt to mark an enemy before dying, instead of marking them and killing them on your own. And those are my ideas for some changes that can be done with Scout's arsenal. Your own thoughts and ideas are welcome in the comments."
500,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,"[IG] ""Afterburn"" &lt;Pyro Mechanic&gt;",4,5r5zas,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/5r5zas/ig_afterburn_pyro_mechanic/,2017-01-31 15:11:26,"~~**Burning enemies have a damage vulnerability, starting at 25% and decreasing to 0% alongside their afterburn - early extinguishes will remove the vulnerability**~~ ~~**Burning enemies cannot receive healing from any source until they are extinguished - health pickups will only extinguish victims, Medigun / Dispenser healing will be blocked briefly until it's removed, and self-healing will contribute to reducing the afterburn's duration (where 6 health is equal to 1 second)**~~ ~~*Afterburn duration is equivalent to damage dealt - i.e. dealing 60 damage with your primary will make it last the full 10 seconds, whereas dealing 30 damage with your secondary will make it last only 5*~~ ~~*Flamethrowers and afterburn damage ignore the +25% vulnerability afterburn places on enemies*~~ ~~*Flamethrowers have their damage vs. burning enemies begins at -25%, and increases to -0% alongside the afterburn timer - early extinguishes will remove the damage penalty*~~ - The Pyro is classified as 'offensive support' by most players, but afterburn is too weak to reflect that. I wanted to use afterburn to help the Pyro become a class all about controlling and disabling the enemy, making them vulnerable and weak so that they can be finished off with a well-placed crit. - On the upside; burning enemies have a damage vulnerability. This buffs your damage pretty nicely, boosting a Flare Gun crit to 108 damage / a point-blank Shotgun to 125 damage at absolute most. This also makes the Reserve Shooter ludicrously overpowered, but it was always a mistake anyway. Hopefully this helps with player's frustrations that Pyro is constantly outclassed by close-quarter classes like the Heavy, mobile classes like the Soldier, and power classes like the Demoman by giving him some extra power. As the crown jewel of this buff, though, is its potential for team support; it weakens enemies, making it easier for teammates to deal with them, especially due to your more limited range. Afterburn will also negate healing on enemies while it's active - this adds to its value as a disabler, so not only does it force enemies to retreat and panic, it also temporarily blocks their supply of healing. Pickups won't heal them, forcing them to retreat further and seek more out, or extinguish it in advance - Medics will have to extinguish the flames before their healing resumes. Afterburn is often said to be too easy to extinguish, so here you go: no method can simultaneously extinguish and heal you. Self-healing like the Concheror, Cosy Camper, and Mad Milk will also reduce the duration, though, so certain unlocks can help dealing with it. - On the downside; the fire damage you deal is equal to the amount of afterburn inflicted. Every 6 fire damage dealt equals 1 second of afterburn, to a maximum of 10 seconds. Thus, a flamethrower needs to deal a minimum of 60 damage to get the full 10 seconds of afterburn on enemies. This also nerfs weapons like the Scorch Shot and Detonator, where spamming them can get favourable results; though this might mean that the Detonator gets buffed in its mobility, which wouldn't be a bad thing at all. In addition, your flamethrower is weaker against enemies who are already burning. This prevents W+M1 to some capacity and places further emphasis on your two alternate weapons, as they don't suffer from the same penalty, letting you finish enemies off with no problems. With any luck, this won't harm players who do prefer their primary in close-quarter areas, as the flamethrower's still a decently formidable weapon - especially as your main source of delivering afterburn. - Overall, I think this buffs afterburn to counter its weak points and bring it into being Pyro's main method of dealing with enemies; disabling their healing, damaging them to kill, and supporting your allies in finishing them off."

This has a cooldown of 4 seconds, and can be replenished instantly by hitting a target with this weapon**~~ ~~**This weapon holsters and deploys 35% faster**~~ ~~*You are marked for death while active, and for 2 seconds after switching weapons*~~ ~~*-25% damage penalty for 2 seconds after holstering this weapon*~~ - Based on Shadow Warrior 2's mobility and with an appearance resembling [combat shurikens](URL these twin blades offer directional mobility and speed as a trade for increased vulnerability and reduced damage. - On the upside; you can dash in the direction you're looking, moving extremely fast for a set distance, every 4 seconds. This offers a lot of mobility which the Pyro's lacking, even with the Detonator - it lets you move out of dangerous situations faster, get up close to enemies faster, and dodge projectiles you're prepared for. Things to note, though, is that you're not invulnerable to damage while dashing (in fact, you're more vulnerable), that it leaves a motion trail behind you, and that it has a cooldown - so time things carefully and use it when you most need it. This weapon must be active to dash, which ties into the other upside; you have +35% increased switch speed, both to holster and deploy, which makes the weapon switch required to dash less of a pain. This feature can also combo with your other weapons, letting you get up close to enemies quickly and rapidly deal massive damage to them. The ability to rapidly regain your dash upon hitting an enemy with your melee weapon also helps, encouraging you to target weaker enemies who'll die extremely quick once you get in range. The ones near death are preferable, as you can easily catch up to them when they're retreating, and you can finish them with a melee hit. All this makes for a weapon that gives you higher mobility and a focus on hit-and-run attacks, comparable to the bonuses a Scout's speed provides him. - On the downside; you are marked for death while it's active, and for a short period after switching weapons. This makes the holster and deploy bonus all the more effective, as you can minimise the time it's out, and evens the playing field when you try to dash towards an enemy prepared for you. Thus, you need to try and surprise enemies by attacking unexpectedly, giving them as little time to attack as possible, which is where the mobility advantage comes in. In addition to your increased vulnerability, you also deal reduced damage upon switching weapons. This is just to prevent Pyros from being able to instantly destroy weaker classes by dashing to them and planting a barrel full of buckshot into the back of their heads, or turning them into toast instantly. Your melee weapon remains as powerful as ever, though, which means it's still pretty effective within its range. Because you're vulnerable to mini-crits while it's active, though, be careful and don't let the enemy hit you. - Overall, the Pyro needs mobility and I want to give him some. At least if this idea doesn't work out here, I can pretty much just give this to the Spy."

One one hand, he's incredibly powerful, so you might imagine that nerfing him would be an ideal solution from a balance perspective. But on the other hand, when you join a pub server and see 4 of them on your team, you aren't exactly thrilled. Yet buffing him is out of the question. The important thing to do is to nerf Sniper in such a way that new players will hardly notice the nerfs, yet experienced players will have to change their strategy with him. That's not to say he should be less effective in their hands, but rather, less effective when playing his role incorrectly. &amp;nbsp; **SNIPER** ~~*Sniper Rifle attack interval increased to 2.0 seconds.*~~ *Previously 1.5 seconds* ~~*Sniper Rifles now deal 20% less damage within 512hu.*~~ *50(150)-150(450) damage at long range, 40(120)-150(450) damage at close range.* Sniper is meant to be a class that dominates long-ranged fights and specializes in area suppression, but is very weak up-close and difficult to use at mid-range. Sniper is meant to participate in fights from a distance while still relying on his team to keep him safe from ambushes. Unfortunately, at higher skill levels, Sniper ends up becoming the most powerful class in the game by a significant margin, with his weaknesses negated by simply quick-scoping enemies who get close. With these changes, the Sniper Rifle becomes less of an all-purpose killing tool and focuses more on precision, with every scope-in being a larger commitment. &amp;nbsp; ~~**SMGs crit on accurate headshots.**~~ ~~**SMG base damage increased to 9.**~~ *Previously 8* ~~*SMG base firing speed reduced 10%.*~~ *Was 0.1 seconds, now 0.11 seconds.* The SMG is notoriously underused due to it's low close-range damage output compared to the Sniper Rifle's. These changes slightly increase the damage it deals (from 10 8-damage shots per second [80 DPS] to 9 9-damage shots per second [81 DPS]) and also makes it's clip size last somewhat longer. The increased damage and ability to crit on headshot gives it the ability to deal a quick 27 damage from it's first shot, letting a Sniper finish off a 175 HP enemy after a headshot, in order to make up for his decreased finishing power from the Sniper Rifle nerfs above. This also gives him a slight increase in burst damage over what he had before, making the SMG a better option at close-range defense. Ultimately, these changes are meant to make the Sniper a bit more reliant on his SMG for self-defense, indirectly nerfing the backpack secondaries that dominate both the casual and competitive meta. &amp;nbsp; **BAZAAR BARGAIN** ~~**On Headshot: Gain 1 head**~~ ~~**Reload while scoped to consume 1 head and gain 50% charge over 0.6 seconds**~~ ~~*100% slower charge speed*~~ I'm not a fan of weapons that can gain permanent bonuses because of a small mistake on one team's part. The Bazaar Bargain is one of those weapons that punishes bad teams more-so than rewarding good players. This change allows a Sniper to gain momentum from his killstreaks, but the momentum wears off quickly if you don't maintain your level of damage output. You're also more committed to every scoped charge, as you can't refund the heads you consume after unscoping, so staring at a chokepoint with a fully charged bodyshot won't work. Visually, consuming a head will play a crit sound and there will be a gleam of light coming from the Sniper's scope, so you'll have some time to react if you see a Sniper scoping in at a distance. This also makes a more noticeable difference for a player fighting against a Sniper as before you had no way of telling if he's charging shots in 4 seconds or in 2. &amp;nbsp; **CLASSIC** ~~**Charge and fire shots independent of zoom**~~ ~~*-20% damage on non-fully charged shots*~~ *No zoom-in headshot delay* The Classic is underpowered as-is, with the upside not being anywhere close to making up for the downsides. With this change, it still fits the role of a more active Sniper, but still lines up with the ideals explained in the [developer commentary.](URL Additionally, because there is no zoom-in headshot delay, the Classic will also begin charging the shot earlier, making it a bit faster to reach a full or partial charge. &amp;nbsp; **SYDNEY SLEEPER** ~~**+20% charge rate per enemy coated in Jarate**~~ ~~**Headshots or fully charged shots cause an explosion of Jarate**~~ ~~*No crits on headshot.*~~ *Can extinguish allies (Extinguishing a teammate this way recharges 20% of your Jarate meter if equipped.)* The Sydney Sleeper is banned in competitive for having too fast of a charge time, letting a Sniper hit a fully-charged bodyshot on the enemy Medic from spawn quickly and safely. This change makes the weapon weaker than stock at first, but as you get more hits you can build up tons of momentum, becoming a massive threat as your near-instantly charged bodyshots are capable of taking whole crowds out of the fight. The charge speed would be based off the number of Jarate'd enemies at the time of scoping. If an enemy dies while you're scoped in, you won't lose charge speed, but you can gain charge speed if another enemy gets coated before you fire. A number at the bottom corner of the screen will show the current number of soaked enemies. &amp;nbsp; **MACHINA** ~~**Full Charge: +15% damage per shot**~~ ~~**Full Charge: Projectiles penetrate players**~~ ~~*Cannot fire unless zoomed*~~ ~~*Fires tracer rounds*~~ ~~*Taking damage reduces charge*~~ The Machina's major downside is that it fires tracer rounds, letting the enemy team know where you are, as well as being unable to fire without scoping. The nerf to close-range quickscopes that all Sniper Rifles now have is enough to make the 'Cannot fire unless zoomed' downside much larger, and the addition of losing charge as you take damage means that, as long as the enemy knows where you are, you won't be able to get a fully-charged shot off between the spam you're receiving. The charge drain would work similarly to the Baby Face's Blaster. You lose 4% charge for every 1 damage you take. Like every other Sniper Rifle, there's a 1 second delay before it begins charging, so spam will prevent you from hitting a fully-charged shot until it's taken care of. &amp;nbsp; **HUNTSMAN** ~~**+25 health on wearer**~~ ~~This weapon reloads passively when not active.~~ *Arrows have slight damage fall-off* [120 damage within 512hu up to 75 damage at max range] The Huntsman is meant to let a Sniper play more mobile and stay on the front-lines of a fight. In practice however, the Huntsman tends to be used to spam a no-falloff projectile into chokepoints and hope an enemy walks into it. It has the nickname 'Lucksman' for a reason. Adding fall-off to long-ranged bodyshots will prevent Snipers from spamming from the back of the map, but won't hurt players who use the weapon properly by playing on the frontlines, or by carefully aiming for headshots. The added health also helps to make the Sniper more viable on the front-lines, while not too strongly affecting the usual threats like Spies and other Snipers. Note that this only adds fall-off, not ramp-up and the max damage will remain unaffected. A max-range bodyshot will deal 75 damage but a max-range headshot will deal the full 360. &amp;nbsp; **DARWIN'S DANGER SHIELD** ~~**+25 health on wearer**~~ ~~**+15% bullet resistance**~~ ~~*+10% critical damage vulnerability*~~ This lets you survive a fully-charged bodyshot (even from the Machina), but you still die to uncharged headshots without an overheal. The increased health means you're more capable of maintaining an overheal from your Medic to give a slight advantage to a Sniper v Sniper, but assuming both Snipers have the same conditions, you won't instantly win any fights you would've otherwise lost. Only fights you would otherwise have tied. &amp;nbsp; **JARATE** ~~**Extinguishing teammates reduces cooldown by -20%**~~ ~~Coated enemies take mini-crits~~ ~~Can be used to extinguish fires~~ *Jarate's time reduced is now based on distance from the center of the explosion* After this change 'guessing' and 'spamming' with the Jarate is much less effective, and you'll need to line up your shots carefully or use it in closer range. The exact numbers for this are 8 seconds at the center of the explosion (the same as it currently is) and 4 seconds at the very edge of the explosion. &amp;nbsp; **RAZORBACK** ~~**Blocks a single backstab attempt**~~ ~~*-7% move speed on wearer*~~ In combination with the nerf to quickscoping and buff to the SMG, running a passive secondary is now much riskier for a Sniper. Combined with a slower move speed, the Sniper is now almost immune to Spies but more vulnerable to any class that gets in his face, as he can't as easily escape from somebody rushing into him and let his teammates deal with it. &amp;nbsp; **SHAHANSHAH** ~~Ignores damage resistances and vulnerabilities.~~ ~~*Cannot be crit-boosted.*~~ The Shahanshah will not gain a damage boost for hitting a Jarate'd Spy, nor can it score critical hits, even when boosted. The upside is that this weapon hits much harder against Dead Ringer Spies, or any cloaked Spy in general."

And no I did not make it. wish I did, though. URL With that said this is a improvement post, not a rebalance post. And I realize that it would most likely be a TF2.5 build, but things need to discussed. With that said, let's get started. What do you think about the Love and War Heavy wind up nerf, the damage and accuracy is decreased unless you fire for 1 second? Kind of crap, eh? What if the wind up was just accuracy and maybe firing speed increase after 1 second of firing or more? Especially if the upside was something like 15% and I guess it could stack with the Tomi. What do you think of the classes having a mouse 3 function(and in the case of the medic mouse 2 on the primary and melee) that would help them out? For the Heavy specifically, mouse 3 is Combat Surplus. It works like this: Without food items. On kill: 2 small health packs that look like team colored candy bars. On assist: 1 team colored candy bar. Mouse 3 to throw the candy bar that acts like a map pickup. Killing a Heavy with several candy bars makes the heavy drop the candy bars. With food items. On kill:20% recharge back. On assist:10% recharge back. Also there is a thread on SPUF called called a Proper rework for a Heavy and it has a RAGE meter for the Heavy as a default. and yes headshots and backstabs still hurt as badly. you build it by doing and receiving damage, it is a 70:30 ratio. What this does is make the Heavy take more damage, thanks to the fact that the RAGE makes you more resistant to damage. unrevved but with some RAGE charge is 15% damage resistance, revved up is 25 to 30% of that, and when meter is at 70% and 100% 7 or 10 seconds of 45% damage resistance on all slots. And I had the idea to make RAGE mode have a additional function depending on the minigun. For the minigun RAGE this stuff is the effects over all the slots: Stock minigun RAGE effect would be extra damage, maybe 15% to 25%. Natasha would offer slow effect on activated RAGE. Brass Beast, ""On kill: 25HP(or more)"" stat as a RAGE ability for your loadout and you move around 50% of your movement speed with the BB revved up instead of 15% or at normal revved up Heavy speed. Tomislav, ""On kill:Speed boost for 4 seconds"" stat on everything in your loadout. Huo long Heater, with RAGE activated fire damage on everything in your loadout. And the minigun damage is the fire boosted one with the fire bullets. Switching away from the minigun burns you for degreaser afterburn damage. And there is a ""holster miniguns to be faster for 8%"" stat as well, which I think would stack with some speed booster items. As well as a LMG variant of the miniguns. which is about making the Holster miniguns for speed boost be in effect on your Primary, for the price of having your 200 ammo points by 4 bullets be 800 bullets total spread over 4 magazines and you need to relaod a Heavy primary and still have a Revv up. I have an idea to buff the Buffalo steak and the Warrior's spirit. First both of the items should have 35% damage vulnerability combined, so 15% damage vulnerability each? Also for a Steak that makes you go in to a melee only frenzy, there is no overheal for the Heavy? Full Overheal and a bit like the Kunai Overheal as overheal deteriorates slower, and maybe even HP on kill?

The changes to the Red-Tape Recorder are identical. Note that these ideas don't have to all apply to the Stock Sapper. They can be applied to various Sapper unlocks. **Electro-Sapper** *Level 1 Building* ~~Disables various pieces of technology, including Objectives, Engineers' Buildings, Kits, Dropped Weapons, Hazards, and Doors.~~ ~~**Sapping Ammo Kits, Health Kits, Dropped Weapons, and Flags applies buffs/debuffs to them**~~ ~~**Sapping Engineers' Buildings, Hazards, Torches, and Doors, will cause them to be disabled**~~ ~~**Sapping Engineers' Buildings slowly destroys them**~~ ~~*Sapping Health Kits, Engineers' Buildings, Hazards, Torches, and Doors, will trigger a cool-down for the Sapper*~~ ~~While Active:~~ ~~**+1 Cap Rate while in range**~~ ~~**-1 Cap Rate for enemies while in range**~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ ~~*100% slower holster speed*~~ (This whole thing is probably a joke since Spy will become OP. But why not make Spy the new META? You guys can come up with some new downsides. Maybe less HP, less speed, less damage.) **Ammo Kits:** *(Map Ammo Kits, NOT Ammo Drops)* When Sapped, the Ammo Kit is always automatically transferred to the Spy (even if he has full ammo and invisibility) if he remains within around 5 metres of the Ammo Kit's respawn location. When Sapped, the Ammo Kit will leave a faint dusty trail whenever it travels to the Spy. It also respawns faster (every 5 seconds). If the Spy is killed, the Ammo Kit will continue to respawn faster for the next minute. Can only Sap one Ammo Kit at a time. Leaving the area will instantly remove the Sapper. This can be beneficial for friendly Engineers; alternatively, this rewards enemies greatly upon killing the Spy. **Health Kits:** When Sapped, a Health Kit will inflict Bleed on enemies that consume it (in addition to giving Health). The Sapper only lasts until the next usage of the Health Kit. There is no way to tell if a Health Kit is being Sapped. Sapping a Health Kit will trigger a 30-second cooldown on the Spy's Sapper. Sapped Health Kits don't inflict Bleed on teammates and are not Unsapped if this occurs. **Doors:** *(Sliding Doors, Garage Doors, NOT Spawn Doors)* Sapping a Sliding Door or Garage door will cause it to jam for around 3 seconds; this can be used as an escape mechanism, such as in Turbine. Sapping a door triggers a 10-second cooldown for the Sapper. **Saw Blades:** When Sapped, Saw Blades will cease movement for 10 seconds and won't damage teammates. Sapping Saw Blades triggers a 15-seconds cooldown for the Sapper. **Trains:** Sapping a Train Track while a Train is travelling on it will disable the Train for 10 seconds. Sapping a Train Track that doesn't have a Train on it will disable the warning lights for 10 seconds. Sapping Train Tracks triggers a 15-second cooldown for the Sapper. **Torches:** Sapping a Torch will cause it to go out for 10 seconds. Sapping Torches triggers a 15-second cooldown for the Sapper. **Dropped Weapons:** Sapping dropped weapons will cause them to have 0 ammo loaded or 0 Uber upon being picked up. Melee weapons will not be affected. **Payload Carts:** Sapping a Payload Cart will either slow it down or speed it up, depending on which team the player is on. This can force the defending/offence team to run a Spy if the other team has one. Sapping a Payload Cart doesn't use up the Sapper, but the Spy must always hold it out (and stand nearby, undisguised and uninvised) for the bonus to apply (making him defenceless). **Control Points:** Sapping a Control Point will either increase or decrease the cap rate, depending on which team the player is on. This can force the defending/offence team to run a Spy if the other team has one. This can be useful for Backcaps on the 5th point of 5CP. Sapping a Control Point doesn't use up the Sapper, but the Spy must always hold it out (and stand nearby, undisguise and uninvised) for the bonus to apply (making him defenceless). **Flags:** You can only Sap your own team's Flag. Sapping a Flag will cause it to slow down the next enemy that attempts to pick it up. Any other enemies that attempt to pick it up afterwards will not be slowed down. This will allow Spies to be useful for a defending team in CTF."

This would later be replaced by limiting the damage bonus to when you had no disguise and removing the cloak penalty, as well as slowing the firing speed and removing random crits. Finally, they nerfed it to what we have now, with a mostly useless damage bonus and a wonky, limited resistance-piercing effect and a small downside (two if on a pub) that outclasses its minor upsides (and the slightly faster spread recovery). As the weapon seems designed for a Spy more actively engaged in direct combat, I would rework the Enforcer to better allow for such a playstyle. It would reduce how long you could stay cloaked (think a reverse of the L'Etranger; this would also affect the Dead Ringer, unlike the original Enforcer) and would be less accurate, but would once again gain its damage bonus while undisguised, as well as mini-crit from at close-range (justifying the removal of random crits). Also, after some reading, I would remove the firing speed penalty as well, leaving this as the 'combat revolver', granting damage (and healing) at the cost of reliable stealth. =New Stats: ~~**While Undisguised: 20% damage bonus**~~ *(Note 1)* ~~**Mini-crits vs. targets at point-blank range**~~ ~~*50% shorter cloak duration*~~ ~~*50% longer decloak time*~~ ~~*25% less accurate*~~ ~~*No random crits*~~ * Spread Recovery: 1.25 seconds * (Note 1): Damage bonus doesn't come into effect until the disguise has completely worn off With my other changes taken into account, this would boost the base damage to 60 per shot, capable of ramping-up to 72  or better yet, 97 w/ a mini-crit) but reduce the accuracy to about that of a basic pistol, as well as limit your cloak and take away your random crits. A devastating alternative to the knife and revolver  if you can get close enough. ----- **Big Earner** =Current Stats: ~~**On Kill: Restores 30% cloak**~~ ~~**On Backstab Kill: Grants a speed boost (Disciplinary Action effect for 3 seconds)**~~ ~~*-25 max health on wearer*~~ The Big Earner is a powerful knife; in my opinion it borders on being overpowered in the game currently, due to how fast it makes the Spy on a backstab (135%, slightly faster than a Scout) while also refilling your cloak. Since I'm gearing the 'Man of Honor' set to be geared for direct combat at the cost of stealth and assassination (having you play more of a thuggish role), I'm thinking of something a bit radical: swap its role with that of the Conniver's Kunai, to an extent. * Big Earner will restore health on kill with overheal potential, instead of a health penalty * A Big Earner backstab will be weak, only able to take out classes around a Medic's health level (though other classes will have their health reduced). You also won't be able to backstab as quickly as the other knives * The Big Earner will provide a faster movement speed while active and uncloaked, allowing you to quickly catch up to even Scouts for a backstab (as well as allow for more mobility around the field and faster escapes). * Disguising while carrying a Big Earner will make you more vulnerable (ain't no one got time for spooks or snitches here) *shot for bad gang speak* =New Stats ~~**While Active and Uncloaked: 30% faster movement speed**~~ ~~**On Kill: Restores 50 health**~~ *Can overheal* ~~*While Disguised and Uncloaked: 40% damage vulnerability*~~ ~~*20% damage penalty*~~ ~~*Mini-crits on backstab*~~ ----- **Conniver's Kunai** =Current Stats: ~~**On Backstab: Absorbs the health from your victim**~~ ~~*-55 max health on wearer*~~ ~~Start off with low health. Kill somebody with this knife. Steal all of their health.~~ * Backstabs will always return at least 75 health * Health restoration is equal to the amount of health the victim actually lost. This can include overheal. * Health restoration can overheal you up to 210 HP (3x your base health with this weapon, which can also be called 200% overheal) * Overheal gained via a backstab will decay at a rate of 2 points per second (Kunai overheal will fully decay within 60 seconds if not replenished), rather than the typical decay rate (which would cause all overheal gained to decay within 15 seconds unless it were replenished somehow). This decay rate is not changed if the spy is healed by a Medic while overhealed by a backstab. However, Medic-granted overheal will still decay within 15 seconds. * Backstabs extinguish afterburn, stop bleeding and cure plague The Conniver's Kunai is a weapon I am...mixed on. The opinions of other players seem to vary between it's useful if you know what you're doing, but the health penalty is a massive downside to it's mostly useless because of how difficult it is to get that first kill. In my personal experience, it underperforms; it might allow you to overheal and cure damaging debuffs on a backstab, but actually getting there is incredibly difficult, and your overheal is fairly easy to rip through. I would like to know other people thoughts as well. In any event, I see these stats as better suited (at least the idea of health restoration) as something better suited to the Big Earner, as mentioned above, while I see cloaking as something more thematically fitting with the Kunai. As such, I'd suggest another radical change: make the Kunai a cloak-version of the Eternal Reward. You give up the use of your watches, their effects and reduce your health, but keeping the Kunai active will not only cloak you, but allow you to strike from cloak (hello Slender Fortress my old friend...). You become incredibly fragile and even easier to kill if discovered, but are also a massive threat until then, since enemies will only have split seconds to attack you once you begin your stabbing spree. =New Stats: ~~**While Active: User is cloaked**~~ ~~**While Active: Can attack while cloaked**~~ *(Note 1)* ~~**On Kill: 50% of cloak restored**~~ ~~*-65 max health on wearer*~~ ~~*Cloak is not restored by ammo crates or dispensers*~~ ~~*Disables watches and their effects*~~ * Maximum Kunai Cloak Duration: 10 seconds * Cloak Fade Time: 0.5 seconds * Decloak Fade Time: 1.0 seconds * Kunai Cloak Recharge Time: 30 seconds * No damage resistance while cloaked * If cloak runs out while the Kunai is active, the Spy's silhouette will be visible. The cloak will not fall however. * Switching to a different weapon causes the Spy to decloak * Cloak cannot regenerate while Kunai is active * (Note 1): Attacking while cloaked causes you to flicker"

The only other weapon capable of this is the Ambassador, which also comes with a slightly slower firing speed and requires you to be able to headshot in the middle of combat (not an easy thing to do unless your enemy is a Heavy or scoped Sniper, as I have humbly learned via my failure to use the weapon). This is a clear case of a weapon being overpowered, due to it having a minor downside easily countered and overcome by its upside. It needs a change; but how? Well, given that the weapon was designed to reward Spies for taking down Engineer nests originally, I would say it should lean back that way. Rather than crits, it can get mini-crits. Upon a building being destroyed with one of your sappers attached though? At that point, your weapon will crit whenever it would mini-crit for a few seconds. Still, the weapon needs a more significant downside; being able to ignore damage falloff is still a powerful thing, even if the damage is curtailed. Rather than follow the Ambassador's 'slow and precise' route however, I would have the Diamondback instead be 'powerful and fragile'. =New Stats: ~~**On Destroying a Building with a Sapper: Turn stored mini-crits into full crits for 10 seconds**~~ *(Note 1)* ~~**Gives one guaranteed mini-crit for every building destroyed with your sapper attached or backstab kill**~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ ~~*20% damage penalty*~~ ~~*No random crits*~~ * Max Crits Stored: 35 * (Note 1): This includes destroying a building with a sapper or assisting in the destruction of a building with a sapper. The Diamondback now serves as a weaker, more reliable version of the revolver when it comes to combo shots on backstabs. If, however, you are able to preserve these crits (and there happens to be an engineer playing) you can boost them to crits for a few seconds, allowing you a (hopefully) much easier escape from an Engineer's nest. Of course you still have to be careful, because you are easier to take down than a regular spy and aren't able to deal as much damage without your mini-crits/crits. "

It doesn't have a real downside. Looking at other speed boost weapons (except the Escape Plan), there's usually a set formula. 1. When weapon is active. 2. + Speed. 3. +Damage vulnerability. 4. -Damage dealt. (GRU, Eviction Notice, Overdose [sans vulnerability, but running around with Syringe Gun deployed and partial Uber...]). Some of these weapons even have a holster speed penalty. So, looking at the Powerjack, why does it not have a damage decrease? In its current state, it gives you 15% extra speed and 20% extra damage vulnerability, but both are only activated when the weapon is deployed. This allows you to bypass the downside by switching from the weapon at the correct moment.

The weapon will also heal 35 Health instead of 25, which is the amount that the Pyro gets from a small Health pack. The Healing can now result in Overheal. The Healing can negate the damage vulnerability if you decide to go into combat with the weapon. However, it must be earned, and again, you have no random crits. I also want to impose a 100% holster penalty. This makes it more difficult for the user to switch to another weapon to negate the damage vuln.

I'm giving the Stock Bonesaw, Amputator, and Vita-Saw the Medicating Melody Taunt, while the Ubersaw is retaining its Spinal Tap Taunt (Solemn Vow doesn't have a special taunt). The Ubersaw now switches slower and deals less damage instead of firing slower. The Vita-Saw now gives a faster charge rate in exchange for no regen. The Solemn Vow now has some damage penalties. The Amputator is getting a damage nerf in addition to the nerf of no longer being unique.

It has you rely on bleeding alone too much, while also giving 2 downsides that you will probably never notice in regular play. Seriously, when's the last time you fought a pyro when you had a wrench equipped? This new wrench is supposed to encourage you to stop turtling and become more aggressive with your sentry placements. It does this by applying active upsides that have you step away from your sentry gun in order to help other people and reveal spies. It also does this by applying a passive downside that will actively destroy you if you ever start turtling your buildings. now for the analysis ~~ ~~ ~~**On Hit: Remove all debuffs from a teammate**~~ This doesn't sound like much on paper at all, but let's think about this for a second. If you see a heavy walking towards you that is on fire or covered in jarate that seemingly appeared out of nowhere, your first instinct is to shoot him with your shotgun or discourage him from coming close with your pistol/wrangler. If he is a spy, then he's dead. If he isn't a spy, he'll try to find your dispenser for some health. Now, what happened in that dramatization? regardless of whether he was or wasn't a spy, you have nobody around you. Nobody is taking advantage of your area of denial and dispenser. If that spy wasn't debuffed, he would of probably killed you with a backstab and sapped the rest of your buildings. This stat would actively encourage randoms in pubs to take full advantage of all your buildings. Now take the same situation above and apply this stat to it. The heavy wasn't a spy, so your first instinct with this stat is to hit him with your wrench. Congratulations, you saved his life from fire/a random sniper that would of killed him if he still had the jarate debuff. The heavy will realize that you can support him easily with health and removal of debuffs when he comes back. He will now stay relatively close to your area of denial so that he will always have something to fall back on in case anything happens. And because he's staying relatively close to your area of denial, he's inadvertently keeping an eye on your buildings in case of a spy or a random power class from coming up and destroying your stuff. Eventually, all of the rest of your teammates will start doing the same thing, meaning that you are finally working with your team to stop the enemy team from getting in that area. They're all working with you instead of against you. ~~**On Hit: Bleed for 5 seconds**~~ Now that your team is working with you, a random person comes up with a debuff and you hit him with your wrench. He bleeds, everyone is immediately alerted that he's a spy and a pyro or a scout tries to get him. Even though he cloaked and now has 2.5 seconds to dodge eye contact before his bleed runs out, the scout and the pyro have done more than enough damage to kill him. Originally with the southern hospitality, this bleed effect had a highly specialized purpose of tracking down a spy, which rarely ever even worked. It would get you killed because, guess what, that spy could have easily matadored you, gotten away with sapping your stuff, and stood next to your dispenser/got away and found a health pack. If you were alone, that spy could have easily thrown himself at you because no one else was there to see. Now that you have teammates, you can throw yourself at a potential spy because even if he backstabs you, he won't have time to sap your stuff since everyone is going after him. ~~*+15% explosive damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ This one might be the most important one that discourages turtling the most. It only takes 2 stickies to destroy a sentry. If you are sitting there smacking away at your sentry for no reason, and that demo gets 2 stickies near that sentry, this stat just assures that you are going to die if you aren't aware of your surroundings. You would of probably died by that demo anyway regardless of the damage vulnerability, but that was more from the back assed sentry placement and being afraid to work with your teammates more than anything. Now, since you're encouraged to stay away from your buildings unless you're upgrading or moving them along with keeping them properly spaced, you could probably use your rescue ranger to get the gun out of harm's way/heal it or try to flank the demo that just destroyed your sentry, giving you more than enough time to build a new sentry and get it back to level 3. But since you have teammates with you, a scout or a pyro can try to flank him from behind without him noticing, or a heavy might walk in front of him with a revved up minigun. Now we're going to talk about how each weapon can synergise with it. ~~ ~~ **The Rescue Ranger** I think it goes without saying that The Rescue Ranger goes with this weapon well. You can put your sentry in a more open and aggressive spot while having the ability to get it out of there if it's getting destroyed too fast. Originally when you got your gun out of there, there was always a chance that a spy would backstab you at the right moment as to knock two birds out with one stone. Now, even if you're killed along with your sentry, your teammates will hold the same area of denial enough for you to build a level 3 sentry and teleport back to the same area. **The Frontier Justice** This weapon also pears well with the frontier justice. If you notice that your sentry is about to be destroyed, let it die, get your crits, one shot a power class, then go back and rebuild your sentry. Now, you can backpedal into your team's area of denial that you set up with your nest and quickly build a sentry again. **The Shotgun** It doesn't necessarily pair up that well with the stock shotgun, but since you're not that near your sentry, if a random spy comes up and tries to sap it, you have 6 shots to kill him, giving you plenty of room for error and allowing you to remove the sapper quicker and without harm. **The Wrangler** If a random ubered powerclass decides that enough is enough and goes after your sentry, you can have it wrangled to essentially waste their time for around 3 seconds while everyone still tries to maintain the area of denial. After their uber is up, you can try to rebuild your sentry while your teammates work with you by cleaning the area up for you to build your sentry safely. **The Pistol** I can't really think of any situations where it could work well with the pistol, maybe this weapon only really works well with unlockables, which would mean that competitive use could be not so viable with this weapon, not that this weapon could initially be a direct upgrade outside of valve casual and competitive servers. ~~ ~~ That's basically all I have for this post, i'm going to be accepting criticism for what i have currently posted and applying some edits for you guys. Just a quick heads up, the first few edits might be just for general formatting, in case of the post not actually looking like what it's meant to look like."

But what about the other melees? Let's take a look. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ **1** **The Back Scratcher** *Level 10 Garden Rake* ~~**+25% damage bonus**~~ ~~**+50% health from packs on wearer**~~ ~~*-75% health from healers on wearer*~~ After some analysis, I'd say this is one of the best-balanced weapons in the Pyro's arsenal. There's no ""while active"" rubbish. It's got a straight, permanent upside, and a permanent downside. It gives you 50% more Health from Health packs, making it very useful for a roaming Pyro who doesn't care for teamwork. As a downside, you get 75% less Healing from both Medics and Dispensers/Payloads. This makes the weapon very bad for a Pyro looking to have a Medic Pocket (or to just help his Medic in general), cap the Payload, or play Pybro with his Engineer friend (we'll get to this soon). This weapon is situationally mildly powerful while being situationally very weak at the same time. It also has a mild upside of +25% damage, which can be useful in any situation. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ **2** **The Homewrecker** *Level 5 Sledgehammer* ~~**+100% damage vs buildings**~~ ~~**Damage removes Sappers**~~ ~~*-25% damage vs players*~~ The Homewrecker isn't the pinnacle of game balance. It's got one main upside, which is that it destroys Spy's Sappers in a single hit (where other melees can't destroy them at all, and Engineers take 2 hits). It's also got an upside of +100% damage vs buildings, which, although it does help with Engineer buildings, is primarily there to increase the weapon's damage against Sappers (which are another type of building). In any case, this weapon won't be amazingly useful for killing buildings that don't shoot you, since any weapon can handle that fairly well. In the case of attacking Sentry Guns, it is mildly useful if you get the jump on them. However, it usually isn't very practical for a melee-wielding Pyro to go around attacking Sentry Guns (it can be effective, but other classes do it way better anyway, not to mention other Pyro weapons). Therefore, we'll view the weapon as having only ONE upside. So, what's the downside? The downside is only a 25% reduction in damage against players. Now, this isn't the biggest of downsides. However, we can say that this weapon is fairly well-balanced because the upside is EXTREMELY situational. It only benefits one class (although, that class then helps the entire team), and is targeted against a specific class's specific weapon (however, it does help to enhance the Pyro's already excellent anti-Spy abilities). Although it's the best in its field of work, the Homewrecker encourages a very specific playstyle, with a minor downside that is always noticeable regardless of the playstyle you have. For this reason, the weapon is fairly balanced. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ **3** **The Neon Annihilator** *Level 1-100 Sign* ~~**Damage removes Sappers**~~ ~~**100% critical hit vs wet players**~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~*-20% damage penalty vs players*~~ The Neon Annihilator is a very interesting melee weapon. It's got more damage against wet players, but less damage in general, which carries over through its crits. However, it doesn't have a damage penalty vs buildings. If it were to only have these attributes, I'd call it an UP weapon, seeing as it only sitationally deals more damage, while dealing less damage usually. It'd be like the Sun-on-a-Stick. Now, looking at the weapon again, it has a ""no random crits"" attribute. This, along with the other two aforementioned attributes, makes the weapon seem very underpowered. Random crits are a very powerful effect of melee weapons, as they have a 15%-60% chance to randomly crit. However, the Neon Annihilator has a 4th attribute. This is the ability to destroy buildings. Wow! Where have I seen that before? Oh right, the Homewrecker already does this, and it kills them in only one hit. Even though you might be a bit annoyed that the Neon Annihilator is treading into the Homewrecker's territory, rest assured, there's a reason why it has this (a very dumb reason). This weapon is basically the pinnacle of a troll weapon; it's designed for Pyroshark/Pybros, who like to hang out with Jellineers on 2Fort. Yep! In non-water related situations, the Homewrecker is better at Sentry, Player (the NA deals 5% more damage, at the cost of random crits), and Sapper combat. This means there is NO reason to use the Neon Annihilator over the HW in a regular game. However, in a wet map (or when players are wet from Jarate/Mad Milk), the NA becomes slightly better, with more versatility in its usage compared to the HW. Overall, this weapon is a downgrade from both the Stock Fire Axe and the Homewrecker in most situations, while being around equal (if not better) in wet maps. Given the fact that there aren't many wet maps and that the water is usually in a very specific spot, I'd call this weapon Underpowered. However, because it intrudes on the Homewrecker's attributes, it's now Overpowered, due to versatility. In general, this weapon was quite badly designed. I understand that it crits wet players and destroys Sappers because it is an electrical sign, but could Valve have not come up with better attributes? I think this weapon needs some rebalancing (I'll do it below). ______________________________________________________________________________________________ **4** **The Third Degree** *Level 10 Fire Axe* ~~**All players connected via Medigun beams are hit**~~ Okay, there's no denying that this weapon's pretty boring, and not much better than Stock. But there's also no denying that it's also a straight upgrade to Stock. It allows you to hit Medics through Medic Beams, such as Amputator Medics and Medi Gun Medics, by hitting their Heal Target. It also allows you to do the reverse, except for the Amputator one (because then you can damage the entire team in one swing). This ability isn't very amazing, but it's an ability that the Stock Fire Axe doesn't have, making the Third Degree a straight upgrade to Stock. So, what can we do? I think a complete rework is needed. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ **5** **The Sharpened Volcano Fragment** *Level 10 RIFT Fire Axe* ~~**On Hit: target is engulfed in flames**~~ ~~*-20% damage penalty*~~ Ah, the SVF. In theory, the weapon, as a weapon with no outside forces acting upon it, is pretty balanced. Not the most useful weapon, but still pretty balanced. It allows you to do damage-over-time in the form of Afterburn, at the cost of a 25% reduction in damage. However, the biggest problem with this weapon is that the Pyro's other weapons already have this upside without the downsides involved. Not only that, but the Pyro has more interesting and probably more useful melee alternatives, that are equally balanced (and one that's blatantly OP). ______________________________________________________________________________________________ **6** **The Axtinguisher** *Level 10 Fire Axe* ~~**100% critical hits against burning players**~~ ~~*-33% damage penalty*~~ ~~*20% slower attack speed*~~ ~~*This weapon deploys 75% slower*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ The Axtinguisher. Oh my. This once OP weapon is now one of the worst weapons in the game, period. It really needs a buff. The concept of the weapon was actually pretty good, but it just can't seem to find that sweet spot, that balance. It's either OP or UP, never in the middle. We have to try to fix this. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ **Conclusion** After analysing the Pyro's melee weapons, I've made a conclusion. Some weapons are OP, some are UP, and some are balanced. **1** **Balanced Weapons** ~~**The Back Scratcher**~~ ~~**The Homewrecker**~~ ~~**The Stock Fire Axe**~~ (obviously) **2** **Overpowered Weapons** ~~*The Powerjack*~~ ~~*The Neon Annihilator*~~ (this is where it becomes weird) ~~*The Third Degree*~~ (not by much) **3** **Underpowered Weapons** ~~*The Neon Annihilator*~~ (see what I mean?) ~~*The Sharpened Volcano Fragment*~~ ~~*The Axtinguisher*~~ ______________________________________________________________________________________________ Okay, so now that we've established that, let's try to rebalance the OP and UP weapons. No rush. **1** **The Neon Annihilator** *Level 1-100 Sign* ~~**100% critical hit vs wet players**~~ ~~**+15% faster firing speed**~~ ~~**Damage removes Sappers**~~ ~~*-35% damage penalty*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ **CHANGES:** ~~**Added +15% faster firing speed.**~~ (from 0.8 to 0.68 firing interval; not too OP, since melee weapons aren't usually used in sustained combat) ~~*Increased damage penalty vs dry players by 15%.*~~ (from the 65 damage of the Stock Fire Axe to 42 damage; this will make it not as useful as most other melees for combat, but it does have a slightly faster firing speed) ~~*Increased base damage penalty vs wet players by 15%.*~~ (crits against wet players deal a total of 127 damage; enough to 1-shot light classes) ~~*Added a 35% damage penalty vs Sentry Guns, Dispenser, and Teleporters.*~~ ~~*Added a 35% damage penalty vs Sappers.*~~ (takes 3 hits to destroy a Sapper, but the firing speed can negate part of the time taken; much worse than the Homewrecker, slightly worse than the Wrenches, and the same as the Jag) ______________________________________________________________________________________________ Okay! How does this rebalance work and what does it change? Well, firstly, we need to identify the problems with the Neon Annihilator. The first problem is that it's too situational. The second problem is that it's worse at combat than the Fire Axe. The third problem is that it's too similar to the Homewrecker. The fourth problem is that it's worse at combat than the Homewrecker. So what do these changes do? Well, firstly, if we're looking at it from an HW vs NA Pybro weapon viewpoint, the Neon Annihilator now destroys Sappers in 3 hits, while the Homewrecker only takes 1 hit. However, the NA fires slightly faster, making its penalty vs Sappers not as bad. Now, comparing all 3 weapons as general combat tools, the Neon Annihilator fires faster than both, but deals the least damage and has no random crits. Overall, worse, but not bad. Comparing the weapons as Pyroshark weapons, the Neon Annihilator is usually the best. However, its critical hits only do 127 damage, killing only the lightest of classes instantly. Not too powerful. Another thing to note is that the Neon Annihilator has a small damage penalty vs Sentries and the likes, but this isn't very important. Finally, the faster firing speed attribute makes the weapon useful in all situations. Looking back at these changes, I took inspiration mostly from the Jag (Engineer melee). However, the Neon Annihilator could possibly be given a slightly faster firing speed boost (from +15% to +25%), without becoming OP. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ **2** **The Third Degree** *Level 10 Fire Axe* ~~When weapon is active:~~ ~~This Weapon has a large melee range and deploys and holsters slower~~ ~~**On Hit Ally: Provides Ally with a 2.5-second Explosive Resistance Bubble**~~ ~~*Explosive Resistance Bubble draws from the user's primary ammo supply*~~ ~~*Per Explosive Resistance Bubble: -25 ammo*~~ (can correspond to the primary weapon's airblast cost) ~~*-20% damage penalty*~~ (give or take) ~~*20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ ______________________________________________________________________________________________ Okay, let's be honest. I have no idea what I'm doing with this weapon. But I don't think these changes are too bad... I have had this idea for quite a while, now. The weapon design draws heavily from the Demoman's swords, the Widowmaker, the Vaccinator, and the Disciplinary Action. Originally (4 months ago), the weapon wasn't going to draw from the user's FT supply. Also, the weapon was going to give Fire Resistance Bubbles, however, these probably weren't going to be very useful. The ""ERBs"" given by this weapon, granted, are one-quarter of the Explosives aspect of the weakest Ubercharge effect in the game. You might be thinking ""but you can just give one guy 2 entire Vaccinator explosive Ubers (or 8 mini Ubers)"". However, the weapon is a melee (albeit with increased range), making it far harder to hit teammates. It also doesn't provide any source of healing. Additionally, the Pyro himself can't really use his Flame Thrower or any other weapon while he's using the Third Degree, not to mention that he takes more damage from all sources, and switches back to his other weapons slower. Also, the weapon uses up 25 ammo per shield, which is 5 more ammo than a Stock Flame Thrower Airblast. Now, think to yourself, ""What's more worth it? Is -20 ammo in exchange for being able to reflect an explosive while mini-crit charging it, killing my enemy and saving my teammate, worth it? Or, is -25 ammo in exchange for being able to negate most of the damage of the explosive for my teammate, while I myself take more damage, worth it?"" To prevent the weapon from being better than Stock (not that it doesn't have its fair share of upsides and downsides), I've given it a 20% damage penalty. Depending on how OP you think the weapon is, I might increase or decrease this penalty. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ **3** **The Sharpened Volcano Fragment** *Level 10 RIFT Fire Axe* ~~**Afterburn deals 6 damage per tick**~~ ~~**Primary and secondary ammo slowly regenerate**~~ ~~*-50% damage penalty*~~ ~~*-20% primary weapon damage penalty on wearer*~~ ~~*-50% primary and secondary ammo from all other sources*~~ _____________________________________________________________________________________________ This weapon can now be used to regenerate your Primary ammo in a similar way to Health Regen. However, you receive less ammo from Payloads, Dispensers, and Ammo Kits. The weapon also allows any primary/secondary to deal 6 afterburn per tick, which is a total of 120 afterburn damage, at the cost of 20% primary weapon damage. Also, the Sharpened Volcano Fragment now deals 50% less damage than the Stock Fire Axe."

Unfortunately due to the comical nature of TF2, we have a meme injected Baguette muncher who laugh-snorts at the Scouts existence and dates his Mother. But I digress. The Spy is possibly the most hated, despised and loathed thing in the game next to Lime/Pink Scouts, Phlog Pyros, Mini Sentries &amp; Crutch Weapon users. Valve have done a pretty good job over the years when it comes to balancing out the Spies arsenal. There have been ups, downs, OP phases &amp; UP phases for some of the weapons. As it stands at the moment, the Spies arsenal is fairly well balanced. Almost everything is equally as viable as each other. Of course there are exceptions to this as is with every class. With Spy having 3 (Technically 4) weapons that are either unviable or so viable they are broken they are often overlooked or forgotten about. As a Spy Main, I feel I have the most valuable input on how the class can function, what it's absolute limits are and what can be done or needs to be done about certain things that are a little off balance. The main 4 weapons in question that I will be looking at and attempting to modify and further balance while keeping the integrity of their current unique identities and functions are; * *Your Eternal Reward/Wanga Prick* (The most unviable knife (Competitively) currently in the game. Sadly due to its nature and unique mechanics/identity, it will likely remain that way until the end of TF2) * *The Enforcer* (The most unviable Revolver currently in the game through coding error. This weapon has gone through quite a lot over the years and has no real identity) * *The Diamondback* (The most broken Revolver currently in the game. This weapon has been deemed incredibly OP throughout the community due to the extreme power its unique mechanics can provide) * *The Ambassador* (This Revolver is OP through Technicality) Along with these items, the rest of the Spies arsenal exists as the standard to be balanced to. But not all of the current items in this 'standard' are perfect either. After some recent posts by an avid item tweaker I was notified that some weapons, while the community thinks are perfectly fine have some very minor things to be addressed. In this post I will be addressing the existence of the 3 (4) items that need some love and punishment along with tackling the minor things on some of the other Spy items and presenting simple, effective fixes to further meticulously balance out these items. I will present the current stats, outline the problematic parts to the items then present my proposals. Let's start the New Year off with a stupidly long Spy post about the little things so meticulous that they most likely not even worth mentioning. Strap in and get your snacks people. It's gonna be movie length read. Welcome to 2017. ^^^^^There's ^^^^^a ^^^^^simplified ^^^^^TL;DR ^^^^^at ^^^^^the ^^^^^bottom ^^^^^for ^^^^^those ^^^^^who ^^^^^don't ^^^^^wanna ^^^^^read ^^^^^lots ^^^^^O ^^^^^wordy ^^^^^words. --- **The Diamondback** ~~**Gives one Guaranteed Critical Hit for each Building Destroyed with your Sapper attached or Backstab Kill**~~ ~~*-15% Damage Penalty*~~ ~~*No Random Critical Hits*~~ The Diamondback. Currently the strongest revolver in the game, and for good reason. This revolver has a very unique mechanic to it and can almost be compared as the Spies Frontier Justice as their mechanics are somewhat similar. ~~**Gives one Guaranteed Critical Hit for each Building Destroyed with your Sapper attached or Backstab Kill**~~ In theory this mechanic can be considered balanced as can any other mechanic in theory. In practice however this mechanic is very overpowered as has been shown by the competitive community (The masters of weapon balance, situational or not) and the rest of the community. This mechanic is the weapons unique identity, do things and be rewarded. As Spy is a very flimsy class it is harder to be aggressive with him than any other class as it will more times than not, result in death. This weapon rewards such aggression by granting a huge DPS boost in the form of free Critical Hits. Accompanied by the same damage reduction as the Ambassador but without the Firing Speed Penalty or Headshot Mechanic this weapon can essentially do what the Ambassador (A skill based weapon) can do but better. This weapon has been labeled ""The Special Needs Ambassador"" by a few people I know in the competitive community and ironically, they're not wrong when they say this as all of its raw damage stats line up perfectly with the Ambassador (excepting DPS potential) and both weapons have unique Crit functions. The Ambassador has the 'Crits on Headshot' function attached, enabling the user to aim, shoot and get Crits at anytime, in 0.96 or more second intervals as long as the shot hits the head. The Diamondback however has the stat listed above and can attain multiple Crits at once and fire them off every 0.58 seconds not having to worry about where on the enemy to aim. This is wherein lies part of the problem of the Diamondback, the unrestrained firing speed combined with the unique Crit mechanic. The Spy can build up to 35 Crits and unleash them at 0.58 second intervals. The Ambassador can only shoot once every 0.696 seconds and can only shoot Crits at 0.96 second intervals. In almost every sense of the manner, The Diamondback is a superior form of The Ambassador, which is the problem. My proposals for this weapon are as follows: ~~**Change the attained Critical Hits on Backstab and Building Destroyed to Mini-Crits**~~ I hold the firm belief that The Diamondback is intended to be the Spies DPS boosted weapon, you do things effectively, you get rewarded with extra damage. That's the unique function of the gun. Changing the Crits attained to Mini-Crits would severly lower the damage output this gun can achieve compared to it's current state, but compered to the overall balance of the game (or at least the dreamers state of balance) this would be easily enough to balance the weapons damage into a state of boosted but balanced damage output. It will do at any distance what a regular revolver will do at basically point blank range a little better. It's a DPS boost, but not too much of a DPS boost to be game changingly powerful. While we're here I also just thought of something else to modify that I can see emphasising the importance of certain picks. Stabbing Medics grants 2 Mini-Crits instead of 1. This might be a little over the top and I don't really have any reasoning behind it other than it emphasises the importance of a Medic pick. --- **The Enforcer** ~~**+20% Damage Bonus while Disguised**~~ ~~**Attacks Pierce Damage Resistance Effects and Bonuses**~~ ~~*20% Slower Firing Speed*~~ ~~*No Random Critical Hits*~~ The Enforcer. The weapon without a proper identity, king of the old Kritz exploits and 1 of 2 inhabitants of the Spies forgotten weapons arsenal. The Enforcer has seen a fair amount of changes over the past few updates. Most notably was when its damage buff was nerfed into becoming a select damage buff that could only be used coming out of disguise. Following that was the radical addition of the resistance piercing stat, which was welcomed by a lot of people as a fresh take on the weapon. Unfortunately this stat was miscoded and is broken and does not apply to certain weapons/items that have resistances. Now The Enforcer doesn't really have an identity or specific role to fill out anymore. It used to be the DPS boost but was a little too powerful of a DPS boost taking the rest of the Spies arsenal into account. Then The Diamondback arrived not too long afterward and outclassed it as the DPS boost, voiding the Enforcer of that role. Every revolver currently in the game has a role it fills; * The Stock Revolver &amp; All Re-skins fill the *Reliability* role. No upsides, No downsides. Just reliability for any task. * The Ambassador fills the *Skill* role. This weapon is designed to work well in comparison to the players skill level. * L'Etranger fills the *Self Utility* role. This weapon is designed to assist the Spy in all of his tasks which revolve around movement and stealth via cloak. * The Diamondback (I believe) is supposed to fill the *DPS Boost* role but is currently the *Token Broken*. The Diamondback I believe is designed to reward the player with more damage dealing capabilities for being effective at what he is designed to do. * The Enforcer does not currently fill any role, and is considered the *Token Useless* weapon for this category. (Every class has at least 1 of these) Now I believe that with the introduction of the Resistance piercing stat, The Enforcer can move into a new role centred around that. This role is catered towards team play, co-ordination and advantage creation. The *Team Utility*. The Enforcer can move into this weapon role, designed to work best with a team that can communicate well enough to act upon advantages when presented. My proposal for this new identity and its complete stat re-work is as follows: ~~**Attacks Pierce Damage Resistance Effects &amp; Bonuses and Negate all Damage, Health and Movement Bonuses for 6 Seconds**~~ (We shall refer to this as 'Tagging') ~~**Attacks do an extra 20% damage on top of all active Vulnerabilities**~~ ** ~~*'Tagged' players may not be tagged again for 12 seconds after the timer has expired*~~ ** ~~*-20% Firing Speed*~~ ~~*No Random Critical Hits*~~ ** This means ANY Vulnerability. It includes General Damage Vulnerabilities, Bullet Damage Vulnerability, Blast Damage Vulnerability, Fire Damage Vulnerability, Melee Damage Vulnerability, Critical Damage Vulnerability &amp; Marked for Death/Mini-Crit De-buff. ** Additional shots do not stack the timer, 1 attack creates a locked 6 second timer that cant have time added to or removed from it. Only 2 players may be 'tagged' at a time. A visual indicator will let only the Spy know which players are tagged. Attacking a player who cannot be tagged will still bypass Resistances, it just wont tag them. Meet the new Enforcer! A team oriented weapon that enables the Spy to weaken targets, communicate to the team and let them work off the weaknesses. I believe that giving the Spy, (already a utility himself to be used by the team) a utility weapon that the team can work with to gain advantages can be powerful enough to make the Enforcer as viable as every other Revolver but not so powerful that it is deemed too strong. Now I will have to clarify the details and technicalities with the stat negations as the way the stat is worded can leave it open to interpretation. * The 'Tagging' attack will ignore any Resistances applied, deal the damage then negate the Resistances &amp; Bonuses. * Health bonuses negated include the following: * Health-on-Hit effects like The Black Box, PBPP, Mad Milk &amp; Blutsauger. * Health-on-Kill effects like The Warriors Spirit, Powerjack, Half-Zatoichi &amp; Claidheamh Mr. * Health Regenerating items such as the Sandvich, Dalokohs Bar, Cozy Camper and un-blown passive effects of the Concheror. * Increased Healing from sources. * Health Bonuses unaffected include the following: * General Healing from Health packs &amp; Medics, The Crusaders Crossbow &amp; The Medicating Aura Taunt. * The Medic's Self Regeneration. * Extra Base Health. * The Effects of the Blown Concheror Banner. * Pyro Extinguishing Teammates. * ALL Damage Resistances can be bypassed by the Enforcer. Passive or Active. The only 2 exceptions are invulnerability from Bonk! Atomic Punch &amp; Stock bercharge. * Damage Resistances &amp; Bonuses that cannot be NEGATED are as follows: * Blown Buff Banner. * Blown Battalions Backup. * Mechanical/Situational Crits &amp; Mini-Crits. (ie. Headshots, Direct Hit, Jarate &amp; Fan-O-War) * The Wrangler Shield. * ALL Medi-gun Passive effects &amp; bercharges. * The Razorbacks Backstab Prevention. * The Shahanshah's Unique Mechanics. * Cloaking. * Movement bonuses negated means exactly what it says. If the player is granted a movement bonus by a weapon or item (eg, Powerjack) that bonus will be negated for the time period. * Movement Bonuses that cannot be NEGATED are as follows: * Knockback Bonuses (ie. Self Knockback Bonuses, Force-A-Nature Knockback, Air-Blast &amp; Detonator/Moon Jumping) * Baby Face's Blaster Meter * Shield Charging * Quick-Fix Blast Mirroring &amp; Knockback Immunity from its bercharge. * Dead Ringer Speed Boost Now some of the affected abilities/bonuses are open to change. I'm gonna keep an open mind. Let me know what and why you think and if I agree I will change it. (I might even put up a seperate post specifically for my Enforcer re-work to be discussed there) --- **Your Eternal Reward/Wanga Prick** ~~**Upon a Successful Backstab against a Human Target, you Rapidly Disguise as your Victim**~~ ~~**Silent Killer: No Attack Noise from Backstabs**~~ ~~*Wearer cannot Disguise*~~ [Your Eternal Reward.](URL Pub Stomper, Aladdin reference and 1 of 2 inhabitants of the Spies forgotten weapons arsenal. Now complete with a forgotten Re-Skin! Your Eternal Reward is a simple knife with a simple concept. Sacrifice manual disguising for instant disguising on backstabs. The thing is, this concept only works on players with average awareness and those not expecting it, and since it removes manual access to a vital part of the Spies arsenal (The Disguise Kit) this weapon relies on there being no Engineers or sentient people to work at maximum effect. Sadly the way that this weapon is designed will force it to remain as the least viable knife available to the Spy. While this weapon may be the most unviable to use in a competitive sense it is fun to use in pubs and other servers or gamemodes. This weapons unique identity/function, I believe should stay the same as it is still a good and fun weapon to use from time to time. The only gripe that can be had with it is that it is very easy for you to be killed unless you're under disguise. Even then it's still somewhat easy to be killed. My proposals for this weapon are as follows: Add a passive ~~**15% Damage Resistance while Undisguised**~~ to Your Eternal Reward to up the survivability of the Spy. Since the Spy has no access to the Disguise Kit which is a vital part to the Spy blending in and surviving among the enemy, he has to rely on getting that first stab, (which can be difficult) to ensure some form of blending in or surviving. Adding this would help the Spy secure that first kill more easily and make him a little less flimsy. I would also like to add ~~**Match Disguises Speed**~~ I would argue that adding this would make sense as the knife is designed around disguises and having the most realistic disguises would greatly benefit this already marginally weak knife. (It's mostly for Scout disguises now that I think about it :/) And finally I would like to add ~~**Disguises Provide Damage Resistances**~~ This could be worded better but what this is intended to do is provide Damage Resistances relative to the classes the Spy has Disguised as. The Resistances wouldn't be too varied nor would they be too large. It would help the Spy survive a little easier. Disguise Damage Resistances are as follows: * Scout: 15% Damage Resistance * Soldier: 25% Damage Resistance * Pyro: 25% Damage Resistance * Demo: 25% Damage Resistance * Heavy: 35% Damage Resistance * Engineer: 15% Damage Resistance * Medic: 20% Damage Resistance * Sniper: 15% Damage Resistance * Spy: 15% Damage Resistance --- **The Spy-cicle** ~~**On Hit by Fire: Fireproof for 1 second and Afterburn Immunity for 10 seconds**~~ ~~*Backstab turns Victim to Ice*~~ ~~*Melts in Fire, Regenerates in 15 seconds and by picking up Ammo*~~ The Spy-cicle. Loved by Spy mains, detested by Pyro mains, seen as a crutch by some casual players and very powerful when combined with the Dead Ringer. This weapon is the best sidegrade to stock if the Spies aim is to survive and out maneuver the enemy Pyro. Dubbed by the casual community as the survivalists knife (Part of the survivalists set; Any Revolver, Spy-cicle, Dead Ringer) this knife has the unique ability to evade Spy-checking from Pyros with relative ease at the cost of using this knife for 15 seconds or less. This knife has seen mixed feelings, reviews reactions and other from the community after it was heavily buffed in the Gun Mettle Update, and for good reason. ~~*Melts in Fire, Regenerates in 15 seconds and by picking up Ammo*~~ Now, of course once the knife is sacrificed for the abilities it provides, the Spy needs to be able to get it back to do his job. It used to take 15 seconds to get the knife back, but after Gun Mettle rolled around the Spy could now replenish the knife with Ammo Boxes, which effectively meant that if the Spy knew where all the Ammo Boxes were or had a Dispenser to fall back to, they could get their knife back in less than 15 seconds. From my experience I have regularly been able to get the Knife back in about 7-8 seconds or less. That's about half of the original timer set for the regeneration, which meant that the Spy could have the Spy-cicle ready twice as much as before, and potentially have an effect stack if the second knife is immediately melted, which is a pretty major thing. While my proposal is a pretty minor alteration it will have a somewhat significant impact on the weapon. My proposal for this is as follows: Alter the amount of knife regenerated from ammo boxes. Let's say the current amount received is 100%, the base of my numbers. ~~*Reduce the current amount regenerated from Ammo Boxes by 30%*~~ It would lower the potential to immediately receive the knife back and force the time waiting on the knife to extend a little. --- **The Big Earner** ~~**+30% Cloak on Kill**~~ ~~**Gain a Speed Boost on Kill**~~ ~~*-25 Max Health on wearer*~~ The Big Earner as it currently stands, is an incredible sidegrade to the stock knife. Designed to excel at chainstabs and escaping after picks at the sacrifice of durability this knife has proven to be an exceptional knife to use both casually and competitively. However, like all weapons in TF2, it is not 100% perfectly balanced. It's more like 99% balanced with just that last 1% to nitpick at. That 1% is; ~~**+30% Cloak on Kill**~~ This stat can be a little problematic for when it comes to attempting to kill someone using this weapon without the use of burst damage exceeding 90+dmg. They will almost always have full cloak/feign charge after the stabbing sprees because of this. Not to mention compounding on top of this is the fact that every enemy drops a medium sized ammo pack, resulting in a gain of more than just 30% Cloak on Kill. Since medium ammo boxes provide up to 50% cloak meter, (depending on the watch) the total cloak gained on kill can come to about 80% depending on the watch used. That's almost basically full cloak for just stabbing one person, and since this weapon is designed and crafted around excelling at chainstabbing and picking multiple targets the user will always have full cloak after a minimum of 2 stabs assuming they go into the fight with 0 cloak, which no good Spy will do. A good Spy will go into a fight with at least 50% of their cloak so as to make an escape if needed, and in the case of the Dead Ringer they should go in with 60%-70% and fill the rest of the cloak with a single ammo box dropped on the first stab. The Big Earner can basically do what a knife that would be designed for a single, almost always guaranteed pick then escape tool along with a knife that is designed for killing multiple people in a fell swoop. Now this stat can be weakened and another stat added to further lessen the insane strength of this feature without interfering with any of the other stats. My proposals for this are as follows: Weaken the ~~**+30% Cloak on Kill**~~ to just ~~**+15% Cloak on Kill**~~ Still providing some cloak on kill as was the knifes original design. And add ~~*-15% Cloak meter from Ammo Boxes*~~ This last stat can be either compounding or additive alongside other stats of the same nature on the Cloak &amp; Dagger and Dead Ringer. My math skills are pretty shitty so I'd say whichever one has less impact on cloak received. It will end up bringing to total cloak on kill received to under about 60% I think. (Someone can correct me if I'm wrong) But my reasoning behind these are that, this weapon excels at chainstabbing. ie. killing multiple people at a time. Rather than have basically full cloak and the ability to escape after a single stab, why not extend that to 2 or more stabs since that's its strength. Instead of having the option to kill one person then pull out with cloak why not make this weapon emphasise a 'go big or go home' esque play-style. Go for the larger plays and get more picks at a time if you want to get away each time. *!REMEMBER!* All of these calculations and reasoning are done under the assumption that the Spy runs in with 0% cloak in the meter. No good Spy will ever do that unless 100% desperate or ready to die for a single pick. --- **Connivers Kunai** ~~**On Backstab: Absorbs the Health from your Victim**~~ ~~*-55 Max Health on wearer*~~ The Connivers Kunai. The ultimate weeaboo weapon. The Spies token 'health weapon' and overall a well balanced sidegrade to the stock knife. The Kunai presents a unique function of health &amp; over-heal on kill at the sacrifice of part of the base health pool. The Spy can effectively live with around 200 health forever with this knife if the stars align and you know every itty bitty aspect of this class, including the lesser known or even relatively unknown things. The Kunai is definitely a different weapon and one that takes a little bit of getting used to if you play a relatively passive style of Spy. The Kunai is designed for the aggressive Spy and to be able to keep up said style of play without having to worry too much. The Kunai could use a small addition to help combat the severity of the following stat; ~~*-55 Max Health on wearer*~~ Now, there is nothing wrong with this stat per say. It works perfectly fine and is a perfectly reasonable downside considering what this knife does for the wielder. This addition is not as needed as other changes in this post, so please approach this change with an open mind. I myself am a little hesitant on the necessity of this addition. ~~**15% Damage Resistance when under 100 Health**~~ This could be a neat little mechanic to boost the strength of an already very strong knife, the reason I have decided to include this and touch upon it is because in a conversation about the Kunai recently a few people told me that they struggled to get that first kill and gain the over-heal necessary to get the ball rolling and function as an effective, aggressive Spy. The reason I said I was hesitant about this was because this particular problem can round back to player skill (Not that most or all problems can't) and knowledge of the Spy as a class, and how to act appropriately on certain things. I myself have no issue with getting this first kill and getting going, but that's probably because I spend most of my time playing Spy as I am a competitive Spy main, so I know the ins and outs of Spy and to do things the average player might not. This stat could help the players who find it harder to use the Kunai effectively and make minimal impact on the overall performance of the knife. Since the Spy only has 70HP with this equipped, being cloaked at base health wouldn't affect the quickscoping capabilities even with the now 35% damage resistance. And since the extra resistance only applies to the user if they are under 100HP it has no impact on a cloaked Spy with a buff of any kind exceeding 100HP. Make what you will of this. It's implementation isn't really necessary, but it would be kinda cool to help out the less skilled players IMO. --- **The Ambassador** ~~**Crits on Headshot**~~ ~~*-15% Damage Penalty*~~ ~~*20% Slower Firing Speed*~~ ~~*No Random Critical Hits*~~ Ah The Ambassador. The cream of the crop. ^^^^^hehe The Skill Weapon, the top competitive choice and one hell of a gun in the right hands. The Ambassador acts like the Spies Sniper Rife without a scope or ability to charge a shot for extra damage. Any player with good enough aim would be able to shoot at timed intervals and acquire consistent Headshots. This however means that effectively, all downsides can be nullified as the user can deal consistent 102 Damage Headshots every second. While this is considered the problem of The Ambassador, very few people have achieved such god-like aiming capabilities. And thus The Ambassador conundrum is this; ~~The Ambassador is considered perfectly balanced until a player reaches a skill level high enough to aim perfectly and consistently~~ On a technical principle, the Ambassador is a broken weapon. But since the majority of players don't have aim good enough to nullify the downsides, the Ambassador is perfectly fine. This is the problem with skill-based weapons, once the skill level to use them effectively enough to nullify all downsides has been reached, they become broken. But majority of the TF2 playerbase does not take the game seriously enough to reach said skill, thus meaning that skill-based weapons are also perfectly balanced. Skill-based weapons unfortunately are a very grey area when it comes to weapon balancing. I have no real solution to the problem this and other skill-based weapons present, as there is no real problem per-say to be solved. As long as a skill-based weapon exists, it will have problems like this or similar to it. Like I said, grey area. I do however have alternatives that can help to lessen the impact of the broken nature this skill-based weapon presents; **Alternative #1** ~~**Mini-Crits on Headshot**~~ ~~*30% Slower Firing Speed*~~ ~~*No Random Critical Hits*~~ If I'm not mistaken this is somewhat similar to the original design of the Ambassador. Mini-Crits on Headshot but without the Damage Penalty and a slightly further Slowed Firing Speed. It would present a more controlled form of extra damage on demand. Up to 80 Damage on Headshot and as low as about 60 if I'm correct. Functioning like a normal revolver that fires slower with an always accessible extra damage option. I feel that this is a suitable alternative to lessen the impact of the almost limitless potential the Ambassador can currently obtain. **Alternative #2** ~~**Crits on Headshot**~~ ~~*-20% Damage Penalty*~~ ~~*30% Slower Firing Speed*~~ ~~*No Random Critical Hits*~~ So this one probably presents the least amount of change stats wise compared to the current iteration. All I've done for this one is raise the damage penalty by 5% and raise the firing speed penalty by 10%. This puts the Headshots at 96 Damage, still respectable and fear inducing worthy but not so powerful as to and the firing intervals at 0.754 Seconds, giving whoever has been headshot, standing still or moving a slightly longer period of time to react. But with this I am also increasing the Spread Recovery from 0.95 Seconds to 1.10 Seconds. The bullet spread recovery is now just under the reload time and should impact the strength of the weapon enough to weaken it but not so much that it becomes difficult to use or unviable. &amp;nbsp; Ok. So. ~~TL;DR~~ Each weapon presented has had very minor touch ups to further refine their balance, complete overhauls to give them a new purpose or has been presented as a discussion topic to further expand upon in the future. * *Diamondback* Changed Crits on Backstab/Building Destroyed to Mini-Crits. * *Enforcer* Complete Overhaul. Granted a new identity as the Team Utility Weapon. * *Your Eternal Reward* Granted several damage resistances to enhance survivability. * *Spy-cicle* Altered the amount of knife regenerated from picking up Ammo Boxes. * *Big Earner* Lowered the strength the cloaking stat on the knife presents. * *Connivers Kunai* Added a mild damage resistance to assist with attaining the first kill. * *Ambassador* Created an open discussion topic on Skill-based weaponry and offered suitable remedies for the Ambassador. As usual, if I have missed anything, borked any formatting, spelling, grammar or other, let me know. Cheers M'Dudes!"

Well, we should make it work well with the Phlogistinator. In the same way that the Manmelter gives a Phlogistinator-wielding Pyro a way to douse teammates, the Third Degree can give a Phlogistinator Pyro a way to protect teammates from Rockets/Grenades/Stickybombs. ______________________________________________________ **The Third Degree** *Level 10 Fire Axe* ~~When weapon is active:~~ ~~This Weapon has a large melee range and deploys and holsters slower~~ ~~**On Hit Ally: Provides Ally with a 2.5-second Explosive Resistance Bubble**~~ ~~*Explosive Resistance Bubble draws from the user's primary ammo supply*~~ ~~*Per Explosive Resistance Bubble: -25 ammo*~~ (can correspond to the primary weapon's airblast cost) ~~*-20% damage penalty*~~ (give or take) ~~*20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ ______________________________________________________ This weapon design draws heavily from the Demoman's swords, the Widowmaker, the Vaccinator, and the Disciplinary Action. Originally (4 months ago), the weapon wasn't going to draw from the user's FT supply. Also, the weapon was going to give Fire Resistance Bubbles, however, these probably weren't going to be very useful. The ""ERBs"" given by this weapon, granted, are one-quarter of the Explosives aspect of the weakest Ubercharge effect in the game. You might be thinking ""but you can just give one guy 2 entire Vaccinator explosive Ubers (or 8 mini Ubers)"". However, the weapon is a melee (albeit with increased range), making it far harder to hit teammates. It also doesn't provide any source of healing or resistances of other types. Additionally, the Pyro himself can't really use his Flame Thrower or any other weapon while he's using the Third Degree, not to mention that he takes more damage from all sources, and switches back to his other weapons slower. Also, the weapon uses up 25 ammo per shield, which is 5 more ammo than a Stock Flame Thrower Airblast. Now, think to yourself, ""What's more worth it? Is -20 ammo in exchange for being able to reflect an explosive while mini-crit charging it, killing my enemy and saving my teammate, worth it (the Phlogistinator has 0 Airblast, though)? Or, is -25 ammo in exchange for being able to negate most of the damage of the explosive for my teammate, while I myself take more damage, worth it?"" To prevent the weapon from being better than Stock (not that it doesn't have its fair share of upsides and downsides), I've given it a 20% damage penalty. Depending on how OP you think the weapon is, I might increase or decrease this penalty. I might also increase the ammo usage of the weapon based on how efficient at Airblasting the primary is. eg: Stock --&gt; 20 Airblast --&gt; 25 Explosive Resistance Bubble Degreaser --&gt; 25 Airblast --&gt; 31 Explosive Resistance Bubble Backburner --&gt; 50 Airblast --&gt; 50 Explosive Resistance Bubble Phlogistinator --&gt; No Airblast --&gt; 50 Explosive Resistance Bubble"

The Scorch Shot and Detonator have greater knockback from jumps. The Pyro's speed is now 110%. The Pyro's health is now 160. By default, the Pyro switches his weapons 20% faster than other classes. The Flame Thrower now has 0.5 metre increased range and fires a larger projectile at a slower rate (but consumes the same amount of ammo). ______________________________________________________ **Primaries** **1** **The Backburner** *Level 10 Flame Thrower* ~~**100% critical hits from behind**~~ ~~**+15% damage bonus**~~ ~~**Extinguishing teammates restores 50 health**~~ ~~*+150% airblast cost*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~*-10% move speed on wearer*~~ Now it's a little harder to W+M1 (100% speed, 160 hp). However, if enemies get into your range (which is now 0.5 metres longer), they'll be faced with a weapon that deals 15% more damage to the front and crits to the back, which is sure to put them off attacking you. Unfortunately, airblast costs 50 ammo, and you cannot deal random critical hits. To somewhat compensate for the airblast cost, any teammates give you 50 health upon dousing them. **2** **The Degreaser** *Level 10 Flame Thrower* ~~**This weapon deploys and holsters 50% faster**~~ ~~**Extinguishing teammates restores 25 health**~~ ~~*+25% airblast cost*~~ ~~*-10 max health on wearer*~~ This weapon allows for deadly combination attacks, with its 50% faster switch speed. Light an enemy on fire and/or airblast them, then follow up with a secondary/melee hit. However, you have 10 less max health than usual (150), which allows many things to kill you faster. Most notably, Sniper Rifles can now kill you in a single fully charged body-shot or uncharged headshot. You also spend 25 ammo on airblasts, but receive 25 healing as compensation for dousing teammates. **3** **The Phlogistinator** *Level 10 Flame Thrower* ~~Projects a short laser beam that behaves similarly to fire~~ ~~**100% mini-crits vs burning players**~~ ~~**Build 'Mmmph' by dealing laser damage**~~ ~~**Alt-Fire on full 'Mmmph': Taunt to gain crit for several seconds**~~ ~~**Invulnerable while 'Mmmph' taunting**~~ ~~**Regenerate all health while 'Mmmph' taunting**~~ ~~*No airblast*~~ ~~*No afterburn*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ The Phlogistinator cannot reflect projectiles, push enemies back, or douse fires. It also cannot create fires or achieve random critical hits. However, unlike other Flame Thrower unlocks, it doesn't decrease your movement speed or max health. One main upside of this weapon is its mini-crits vs burning targets. This may seem OP, however, the weapon itself can't actually set anything on fire. It requires the use of the Flare Gun, Detonator, Scorch Shot, or Third Degree to set people on fire. This encourages reverse combo-attacks. It also charges up a Mmmph meter upon dealing damage. Previously, afterburn was able to contribute to this Mmmph meter. However, now, only laser damage from the weapon itself or the Manmelter can contribute to the Mmmph meter. Note that the damage increase due to fire-based secondaries/melees can indirectly assist in building the Mmmph meter. Once Mmmph is full, taunt to gain full-crits for several seconds afterwards, in addition to refilling all your health and becoming invulnerable to damage for around 2 seconds for the duration of the taunt. ______________________________________________________ **Secondaries** **1** **The Flare Gun** *Level 10 Flare Gun* ~~**100% critical hit vs burning players**~~ ~~**Deals afterburn damage**~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~This weapon will reload when not active~~ This weapon sacrifices the reliable hitscan of the Shotgun, in exchange for the ability to light enemies on fire from a distance, as well as the ability to Flare Jump. There are several other Flare Gun unlocks, but this is the only one that can gain full 90 damage crits on burning enemies. This encourages deadly combo play with fire-lighting primaries or melees, or even the weapon itself. The Flare Gun fires projectiles that need some skill to aim. The Flare Gun cannot destroy stickybombs. **2** **Detonator** *Level 10 Flare Gun* ~~Alt-Fire: Detonate flare.~~ ~~**100% mini-crits vs burning players**~~ ~~**Deals afterburn damage**~~ ~~**+30% self damage force**~~ ~~*-25% damage penalty*~~ ~~*+50% damage to self*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~This weapon will reload automatically when not active.~~ The Detonator is very similar to the Flare Gun, but it deals a lot less damage. Instead, its main function is the ability to detonate flares mid-flight, which can assist in aiming and/or set large groups on fire. The Detonator also features a higher Flare Jump that deals more damage to yourself. The Detonator's mini-crits can be useful for combo combat. The Detonator can destroy stickybombs. **3** **The Reserve Shooter** *Level 10 Shotgun* ~~**Mini-crits targets launched airborne by explosions, grapple hooks or enemy attacks**~~ ~~**40% more accurate**~~ ~~*-20% firing speed*~~ ~~*-34% clip size*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~*This weapon deploys 15% slower*~~ The Reserve Shooter is based off the Shotgun. It allows you to mini-crit targets launched airborne by explosives, grappling hooks or airblast, encouraging combo-play with weapons like the Degreaser or Stock Flame Thrower. It also fires 40% more accurate shots, allowing for deadly aerial attacks. However, the weapon fires 20% slower and only holds a clip of 4 shots. It also deploys 15% slower and cannot deal random critical hits. The Reserve Shooter destroys stickybombs. **4** **The Manmelter** *Level 30 Indivisible Particle Smasher* ~~Fires a laser projectile that behaves similarly to flares~~ ~~**100% mini-crits vs burning players**~~ ~~**+30% projectile speed**~~ ~~**Does not require ammo**~~ ~~**Alt-Fire: Extinguish teammates**~~ ~~**Extinguishing teammates restores 10 health**~~ ~~*No afterburn*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~This weapon will reload automatically when not active.~~ The Manmelter cannot achieve random critical hits. However, it can achieve mini-crits if it hits a burning target. Unfortunately, like the Phlogistinator, it cannot set people on fire. However, it contributes to the Phlogistinator Mmmph meter, unlike other secondaries, and it also can be used in conjunction with fire-based primaries and melees to deal the increased damage. The Manmelter somewhat covers for the Phlogistinator's lack of airblast, by allowing you to douse teammates for 0 ammo and receive 10 health. However, it still cannot reflect projectiles or push back enemies. The Manmelter also uses 0 ammo for its own flares and has flares that travel 30% faster than the Flare Gun. Don't forget that this weapon is still capable of Flare Jumps, like other Flare Guns. The Manmelter cannot destroy stickybombs. **5** **The Scorch Shot** *Level 10 Flare Gun* ~~**100% mini-crits vs burning players**~~ ~~**Flare knocks back target on hit and explodes when it hits the ground**~~ ~~**Increased knockback on burning players**~~ ~~**Deals afterburn damage**~~ ~~**+20% self damage force**~~ ~~*-35% damage penalty*~~ ~~*+30% damage to self*~~ ~~This weapon will reload automatically when not active.~~ The Scorch Shot deals less damage than all other Pyro secondaries. However, it does grant an explosive that is similar in nature to the Detonator, as well as a slightly higher Flare Jump. The Scorch Shot's main feature is its increased knockback to enemies, especially burning enemies, and its double-hit flare. Its explosive detonates automatically upon hitting a surface, unlike the Detonator. The Scorch Shot can be useful for combo combat. The Scorch Shot destroys stickybombs. **6** **The Panic Attack** *Level 1-99 Shotgun* ~~Start with 0 shots loaded~~ ~~Hold fire to load up to 4 shots into the weapon~~ ~~Fire can be released at any time to release the shots~~ ~~If 4 shots are loaded, the weapon can be loaded indefinitely~~ ~~**50% faster reload time**~~ ~~**This weapon deploys 100% faster**~~ ~~**30% faster firing speed**~~ ~~**Firing speed increases as health decreases**~~ ~~*-34% max clip size*~~ ~~*Cannot switch weapons while ammo is loaded*~~ ~~*No ammo from dispensers when active*~~ ~~*This weapon holsters 50% slower*~~ The Panic Attack is a weapon that starts unloaded. However, when loaded, it fires a super fast barrage of bullets. It can fire up to 4 bullets in one barrage, and it fires even faster when you are low on health. The Panic Attack is a very good weapon for self-defence. It also loads shots faster and deploys faster, however, it holsters slower. The Panic Attack cannot be switched away from and you cannot gain ammo from dispensers while it is active. The Panic Attack's barrage doesn't have as many shots as a full Shotgun clip, but the weapon can function fairly well as a single-fire weapon if shots are individually loaded into the weapon. The Panic Attack can destroy stickybombs. ______________________________________________________ **Melees** **1** **The Axtinguisher** *Level 10 Fire Axe* ~~**100% critical hit vs burning players**~~ ~~*-50% damage penalty vs non-burning players*~~ ~~*-20% damage penalty vs burning players*~~ ~~*This weapon deploys 50% slower*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ The Axtinguisher functions well as a finisher weapon. It pairs very well with the Degreaser and the Stock Flame Thrower. However, it is probably best not to use this weapon with the Backburner or Phlogistinator, due to the downsides on those weapons. The Axtinguisher deals 156 damage to burning enemies, usually killing them in one blow. However, it deals less damage to non-burning targets, and cannot achieve random critical hits. The weapon also deploys 50% slower. Hits against non-burning enemies deal 33 damage. **2** **The Homewrecker** *Level 5 Sledgehammer* ~~When weapon is active:~~ ~~**Damage removes Sappers**~~ ~~**+100% damage vs buildings**~~ ~~**-80% damage and knockback from sentry bullets**~~ ~~*-25% damage vs players*~~ ~~*+40% damage from sentry rockets, engineer shotguns and engineer pistols*~~ ~~*-10% move speed on wearer*~~ The Homewrecker's primary use is to destroy Sappers in a single hit, which can benefit friendly Engineers, which also benefits the rest of the team, including yourself. However, the weapon deals less damage to enemies and has no PvP perks, making it a poor choice for that form of combat. The Homewrecker, when actively held, can be used to either bypass Sentries or run towards Sentries. It heavily reduces hitscan damage and knockback from Sentries while it is held. The weapon also deals double damage to Sentries, taking out Mini-Sentries in 1 hit and other buildings in 2. However, if the Sentry is level 3, bypassing it may not be so easy, as you take more damage from the rockets. Also, an alert Engineer can easily finish you off himself, with his own handheld weaponry. As a further downside, you receive a 10% speed penalty when the weapon is deployed (100% forward speed). **3** **The Powerjack** *Level 5 Sledgehammer* ~~When weapon is active:~~ ~~**10% faster move speed on wearer**~~ ~~**+75 health restored on kill**~~ ~~*-25% damage penalty*~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ The Powerjack gives a passive speed boost while it is active, increasing your speed to 125%. However, you receive 20% more damage from all sources while it is active, making it risky to use in combat. Not only that, but the weapon deals 25% less damage than the Stock Fire Axe. To slightly reward you for getting risky melee kills, the Powerjack grants 50 health on a kill, with Overheal. **4** **The Back Scratcher** *Level 10 Garden Rake* ~~**+30% damage bonus**~~ ~~**+50% health from packs on wearer**~~ ~~*20% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*-75% health from healers on wearer*~~ The Back Scratcher deals a whopping 85 damage on melee swings. However, it swings 20% slower than the Stock Fire Axe. The Back Scratcher also gives you 50% more health from backs, which is useful for a roaming Pyro. However, team-player Pyros should be wary, as they receive 75% less healing from Medics, Dispensers, and Payloads. As a side-effect, the 75% less healing from Medics can be useful for building up an Ubercharge for the Medic. **5** **The Sharpened Volcano Fragment** *Level 10 RIFT Fire Axe* ~~**Regenerate 4 primary ammo per second on wearer**~~ ~~**+30% ammo from packs on wearer**~~ ~~*-35% damage penalty*~~ ~~*+15 airblast cost on wearer*~~ ~~*-50% ammo from dispensers on wearer*~~ The Sharpened Volcano fragment grants powerful passive upsides and downsides. You regenerate 4 primary ammo per second and receive 30% more ammo from packs, at the cost of a 50% decrease in ammo from dispensers and payloads. It is advised that you do not use this weapon with the Backburner, as airblast will be increased to 65 ammo per attack. The Stock Flame Thrower will spend 35 ammo per airblast, while the Degreaser will spend 40 ammo per airblast, making the cost not too severe, but still worse than usual. However, the Phlogistinator can't airblast at all, so it isn't affected by the airblast downside. The melee weapon itself deals 35% less damage than the Stock Fire Axe. **6** **The Third Degree** *Level 10 Fire Axe* ~~When weapon is active~~ ~~**100% mini-crits vs burning players**~~ ~~**On Hit: Target is engulfed in flames**~~ ~~**This weapon deploys 50% faster**~~ ~~*-20% damage penalty*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ The Third Degree mainly serves as the only source of afterburn for the Phlogistinator/Manmelter/Third Degree set. Its afterburn will increase the damage outputs of both of the other two weapons, encouraging you to light enemies on fire with the melee first, before attacking with the other weapons. To make this easier, the weapon deploys 50% faster. However, be aware of the 20% damage vulnerability you will receive while you are holding the weapon out. The Third Degree is somewhat useful for other loadouts, however, it isn't too amazing. It deals mini-crits against burning targets, meaning that it can combo with itself for a sequence that reads ""52-70 etc"". It also combos with other fire-based weapons, dealing 70 damage instead of 65, and deploying 50% faster. However, the damage vulnerability and lack of random crits may deter anyone from using this strategy. Also, this weapon is not as effective at this strategy as the Axtinguisher. **7** **The Neon Annihilator** *Level 1-100 Sign* ~~**100% critical hit vs wet players**~~ ~~**Second hit in a row wets enemies**~~ ~~**25% faster firing speed**~~ ~~**20% faster swim speed on wearer**~~ ~~*-50% damage penalty vs dry players*~~ ~~*-20% damage penalty vs wet players*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ The Neon Annihilator turns any Pyro into an amphibious monster, swimming at 110% speed in and out of the water. Such a Pyro also deals 156 damage critical hits to enemy players in water or dripping wet. However, the Neon Annihilator only deals 33 damage to dry players and cannot achieve random critical hits. If the weapon is used outside of the water, it can be turned into a combo weapon. The first two hits will deal 66 damage in total, while the last hit will deal 156 damage, due to the 2nd hit causing the enemy to be covered in liquid. A 25% faster firing speed may assist a player in performing such a combo. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ **Edits** The Backburner now has a 15% damage bonus instead of frontal mini-crits. The Powerjack boosts your speed by 10% but heals 75 health on kill, instead of a 15% boost and 50 health on kill. The Sharpened Volcano Fragment no longer causes an airblast delay."

The Scorch Shot and Detonator have greater knockback from jumps. The Pyro's speed is now 110%. The Pyro's health is now 160. By default, the Pyro switches his weapons 20% faster than other classes. The Flame Thrower now has 0.5 metre increased range and fires a larger projectile at a slower rate (but consumes the same amount of ammo). ______________________________________________________ **The Phlogistinator** *Level 10 Flame Thrower* ~~Projects a short laser beam that behaves similarly to fire~~ ~~**100% mini-crits vs burning players**~~ ~~**Build 'Mmmph' by dealing laser damage**~~ ~~**Alt-Fire on full 'Mmmph': Taunt to gain crit for several seconds**~~ ~~**Invulnerable while 'Mmmph' taunting**~~ ~~**Regenerate all health while 'Mmmph' taunting**~~ ~~*No airblast*~~ ~~*No afterburn*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ The Phlogistinator cannot reflect projectiles, push enemies back, or douse fires. It also cannot create fires or achieve random critical hits. However, unlike other Flame Thrower unlocks, it doesn't decrease your movement speed or max health. One main upside of this weapon is its mini-crits vs burning targets. This may seem OP, however, the weapon itself can't actually set anything on fire. It requires the use of the Flare Gun, Detonator, Scorch Shot, or Third Degree to set people on fire. This encourages reverse combo-attacks. It also charges up a Mmmph meter upon dealing damage. Previously, afterburn was able to contribute to this Mmmph meter. However, now, only laser damage from the weapon itself or the Manmelter can contribute to the Mmmph meter. Note that the damage increase due to fire-based secondaries/melees can indirectly assist in building the Mmmph meter. Once Mmmph is full, taunt to gain full-crits for several seconds afterwards, in addition to refilling all your health and becoming invulnerable to damage for around 2 seconds for the duration of the taunt. ______________________________________________________ **The Manmelter** *Level 30 Indivisible Particle Smasher* ~~Fires a laser projectile that behaves similarly to flares~~ ~~**100% mini-crits vs burning players**~~ ~~**+30% projectile speed**~~ ~~**Does not require ammo**~~ ~~**Alt-Fire: Extinguish teammates**~~ ~~**Extinguishing teammates restores 10 health**~~ ~~*No afterburn*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~This weapon will reload automatically when not active.~~ The Manmelter cannot achieve random critical hits. However, it can achieve mini-crits if it hits a burning target. Unfortunately, like the Phlogistinator, it cannot set people on fire. However, it contributes to the Phlogistinator Mmmph meter, unlike other secondaries, and it also can be used in conjunction with fire-based primaries and melees to deal the increased damage. The Manmelter somewhat covers for the Phlogistinator's lack of airblast, by allowing you to douse teammates for 0 ammo and receive 10 health. However, it still cannot reflect projectiles or push back enemies. The Manmelter also uses 0 ammo for its own flares and has flares that travel 30% faster than the Flare Gun. Don't forget that this weapon is still capable of Flare Jumps, like other Flare Guns. The Manmelter cannot destroy stickybombs. ______________________________________________________ **The Third Degree** *Level 10 Fire Axe* ~~When weapon is active~~ ~~**100% mini-crits vs burning players**~~ ~~**On Hit: Target is engulfed in flames**~~ ~~**This weapon deploys 50% faster**~~ ~~*-20% damage penalty*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ The Third Degree mainly serves as the only source of afterburn for the Phlogistinator/Manmelter/Third Degree set.

Today I'm tackling the Southern Hospitality. This is a weird weapon. You know how Valve has the weirdest ways of balancing weapons, it's one of those. It's considered better than stock in competitive, but in casual, it's a niche weapon, the nichest of weapons, so it's not as used as other wrenches. At the end of the day, it's best to change this, whatever the reason. Current Stats ~~**On Hit:Bleed for 5 seconds**~~ ~~*No random Crits*~~ ~~*20% fire vulnerability on wearer*~~ New Stats ~~**+100% damage vs Sappers**~~ ~~**+25% faster repair rate**~~ ~~**+25% damage vs Players**~~ ~~*-15% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*Construction hit speed boost reduced by 30%*~~ I'm leaving at that for further input, cause I'm curious on your guy's opinion for this direction. The Southern Hospitality is an anti-Spy weapon, which kinda works, but it encourages the bad habit of getting close to spies, which they like, instead of shooting them, which they don't like. Plus you only get 2 seconds of bleed on them, which if you can hit them in that space of time, you can shoot them. This serves as an anti-spy in a more efficient way, trading metal for extra time. Any suggestions are welcomed EDIT: changed to reverse Jag"

It was meant to be a minigun that restored the Heavy's health at the cost of damage output, but ended up being replaced by Natascha; most likely this is due to the original Ludmilla design being overpowered (it operated like a regular minigun with primary fire, while restoring 3 health on hit and dealing only 75% damage with the alt-fire. The downside would be that you could never stay spun up without wasting ammo, which isn't actually a major downside most of the time even considering Heavy's modern nerfs). So, here's my take on how the forgotten gun might be made to work in a more balanced sense: **Ludmila** ~~Energy Weapon: This weapon cannot deal critical hits, deals reduced damage to buildings, and does not require ammo~~ ~~**While Spun-Up: Wearer moves 25% faster and restores the health of allies**~~ ~~**100% more accurate**~~ ~~*While Spun-Up: 50% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ ~~*Consumes an additional 5 ammo per second while spun-up*~~ ~~*3 fewer bullets per shot*~~ * Uses a regenerating charge meter (called 'Ludmilla') rather than conventional ammo * Max Charge: 200 points * Recharge Speed: 10 points per second * Damage Penalty vs. Buildings: 80% * When crit-boosted, energy weapons will deal mini-crits instead of full crits * Minimum Health Restoration: 10 HP/s * Maximum Health Restoration: 30 HP/s * Healing Radius: 80 HU (5 ft) * Minigun healing also affects the wielder * Healing ramps up after 10 seconds, capping 5 seconds later * Healing is reset whenever the wielder takes damage * Faster movement speed while spun-up does replaces the normal movement speed penalty. It does not stack with it."

Assuming that there is no way the Claid would be reverted to its old stats, I've tried to balance the new Claid into a weapon that's actually worth using. These changes serve to make the new Claid what it was intended to be, a weapon for the half-knight. The Tough Break holster/deploy penalties have been completely removed from the weapon, and replaced with a holster/deploy speed increase. The health regained on kills has been very slightly increased and allowed to overheal, to make it somewhat more noticeable (though still not as powerful as the health gain of the Zatoichi). The reduced max ammo on secondary weapons stops the weapon from being a straight upgrade to the bottle for sticky-using demomen, as the damage vulnerability on its own is quite small and rarely noticeable for a class that doesn't focus on melee combat. The slight damage vulnerability while the weapon is active also encourages the user to switch away from the weapon as soon as they've finished using it. As always, all feedback is very much appreciated.

Projectiles that hit while raising your shield are deflected as mini-crits~~ ~~*-25% explosive vulnerability*~~ ~~(Hidden -) Deflected projectiles are 'mirrored' on impact, ricocheting at the same angle as they landed. In order to reflect them back, the wearer must face projectiles head-on. Damage resistance is gained upon raising the shield, with it dropping off to 0% after 3 seconds~~ - A more passive version of the existing shields, the Killegray Kite exists to serve those who prefer a focus on ranged combat with self-defense as an option; using damage resistance and the ability to deflect projectiles off your shield over charging headlong towards the enemy for melee kills. - On the main point; you gain the chance to deflect projectiles. When they hit you from the front, they will ricochet or bounce off and continue on at the same angle as they landed (e.g. if the centre of your front is hit from a 36-degree angle by a rocket from your left, it will be sent off to the right at a 36 degree angle) - so, if you want to reflect like a Pyro, look at where the projectiles coming from. I gave this deflection rather than reflection because of the ability to keep the shield raised constantly, rather than have to be ready for everything that might be coming at you and likely die to a Beggar's. The ability to deflect also comes with skill-based timing, like airblasting, with the opportunity to turn projectiles that land during the 'shield raising' phase into mini-crits; however, if you don't want to deal with that, you can simply keep your shield raised constantly at the cost of your movement speed and you'll deflect every projectile coming at your face easily. You also gain damage resistance while the shield is raised, starting at 75% from the moment it enters the raising phase and ending at 0% 3 seconds afterwards. This allows you to protect yourself with timing, like a Pyro, even against enemies that rely on bullet-oriented weapons like Heavies and Scouts. Lastly, it grants you the ability to tank enemy fire when it's directed your way - stand in front of them, raise your shield, take the enemy's spam for your team, and lead them to victory with copious amounts of explosives and alcohol. - On the downside; you're more vulnerable to explosives. Because this gives you the ability to deflect literally all of them, no matter how long that shield's raised, so it punishes you for failing. Yeah. Also, watch out for when they shoot just a little behind you. And rollers. - Overall, this little foray into a passive shield defense for the Demoman has given me a few ideas for what to do with the mechanics of airblast, too. So I'm glad I wrote all this up at 6:30 in the morning."

Deals 65 damage to enemies.~~ ^^^^^^^. **Ubersaw** *Level 4 Bonesaw* ~~**On hit: 25% of the user's Ubercharge meter is filled**~~ ~~*Fires 20% slower*~~ ^^^^^^^. **Vitasaw** *Level 1 Bonesaw* ~~**On death: 20% of the current ubercharge meter is retained**~~ ~~*-10 max health on user*~~ ^^^^^^^. **Amputator** *Level 10 Bonesaw* ~~**While active: Up to +3 health regenerated per second**~~ ~~**On taunt: Nearby teammates regain health, increasing with time out of combat**~~ ~~*Deals 20% less damage*~~ ^^^^^^^. **Solemn Vow** *Level 2 Bust of Hippocrates* ~~""Do no harm.""~~ ~~**User can see enemy health**~~ ~~*Fires 10% slower*~~ ^^^^^^^. **** ~~Changed Stats:~~ ^^^^^^^. **Medic** *Level 4 Field Doctor* ~~**Base 160 HP (up from 150 HP)**~~ ~~*When headshot, health regeneration is briefly disabled for 3 seconds*~~ ~~Note(s): This change is meant to give Medics a better chance to survive against Snipers. Of course, Snipers who are smart enough to shoot twice, or to charge their shots, won't have much trouble, as the Medic will be extremely vulnerable at only 10 HP for a few seconds.~~ ^^^^^^^. **Syringe Gun** *Level 4 Syringe Gun* ~~A weapon that fires syringes at eneies, which travel in an arc. Carries 200 ammo, with 40 syringes per clip. Fires roughly 10 syringes per second.~~ ~~**On hit: 0.5% of the user's Ubercharge meter is filled**~~ ~~Note(s): A direct upgrade to the default weapon of the Medic, the Syringe Gun can now build uber with every shot it lands (or, depending on how the game is coded, every two shots). Certainly a buff to Battle Medics, and a nice sidegrade for those who can't afford a Crusader's Crossbow. The base ammo is also more consistent, meaning a Medic who doesn't pick up ammo packs and uses all their syringe ammo will still consistently have 40 syringes per clip.~~ ^^^^^^^. **Blutsager** *Level 1 Syringe Gun* ~~**On hit: Gain health increasing with distance (min +3, max +5)**~~ ~~**On hit: 1% of the user's Ubercharge meter is filled**~~ ~~*25% smaller clip*~~ ~~*Health regeneration on user reduced (min +1 hps, max +4 hps)*~~ ~~Note(s): Even better for Battle Medics, the new Blutsager has higher uber buildup per syringe hit than the default Syringe Gun. Of course, given the smaller clip (30 vs 40), that's only a slightly higher amount overall (with all shots in a clip landed, the Syringe Gun can build 20% Uber, while the Blutsager can build 30% Uber), so it'll take some skill to do so. Meanwhile, the health per syringe hit is buffed, with an increase in health by distance.~~ ^^^^^^^. **Crusader's Crossbow** *Level 10 Crossbow* ~~Fires special bolts that heal teammates and damage enemies~~ ~~**Bolt healing provides a basic Ubercharge buildup (unaffected by stock Syringe Gun change)**~~ ~~**Bolt healing and damage increases with distance between user and target**~~ ~~**This weapon automatically reloads when not active**~~ ~~**On headshot: Bolt healing to teammates increased by 35%**~~ ~~**On headshot: Enemies take minicrit damage**~~ ~~*-75% max primary ammo on user*~~ ~~*-98% smaller clip*~~ ~~Note(s): Ehhhhhhhhh, I didn't want to piss off Medic mains, so I just stuck with mostly sidegrades instead of nerfs to the Crossbow. I did add a headshot bonus to the Crossbow for those who like to do trickshots, though, so there's that. It should also be noted that the new uber buildup from syringes doesn't apply to the Crossbow, which already doesn't have syringes and currently can build Uber on hits.~~ ^^^^^^^. **Overdose** *Level 2 Syringe Gun* ~~**25% of current Ubercharge meter is provided as a speed bonus to the user and their healing target**~~ ~~**50% of the current Ubercharge meter is provided as a jump height bonus to the user and their healing target**~~ ~~*15% of the current Ubercharge meter is provided as a damage penalty to the user and their healing target*~~ ~~*Deals 20% less damage*~~ ~~Note(s): Holy buffs, Batman! The Overdose now provides more than just a measly escape bonus for Medics. It's a direct bonus to both the healer and his patient, making them faster and better at jumping. Of course, users should be wary, as their speed comes at a price - vulnerability, as well as lower damage output with the weapon.~~ ^^^^^^^. **Medigun** *Level 4 Medigun* ~~Unchanged. Don't want to piss anyone off.~~ ^^^^^^^. **Kritzkrieg** *Level 1 Medigun* ~~Ubercharge: User and healing target gain guaranteed critical hits for 8 seconds~~ ~~**+25% faster charge buildup rate**~~ ~~Note(s): A small buff for Battle Medics. The Medic can still use crits if they switch to their primary or melee now.~~ ^^^^^^^. **Quick-Fix** *Level 10 Medigun* ~~Ubercharge: User and heal target gain +300% heal rate and immunity to stunning for 8 seconds~~ ~~**+40% faster heal rate**~~ ~~**+10% faster charge buildup rate**~~ ~~**User performs the blast jumps, double/triple jumps, knockback, and shield charges of their target**~~ ~~*While Ubercharged: User and healing target cannot push carts, carry intelligence, or capture points*~~ ~~*Healing targets gain 50% less overheal*~~ ~~Note(s): Just added a few extra maneuverability things that should be applied to Medics from their healing target(s).~~ ^^^^^^^. **Vaccinator** *Level 2 Medigun* ~~Press Reload to cycle through specific resistance types (Bullet, Explosive, Fire)~~ ~~Ubercharge: User and healing target receive 100% crit resistance and 75% damage resistance, both based on the selected resistance type, for 3 seconds~~ ~~**+67% faster charge buildup rate**~~ ~~**User receives +20% resistance to the selected resistance type**~~ ~~**While healing, the healing target receives a passive +10% resistance to the selected resistance type**~~ ~~*While healing, the healing target receives a passive +15% damage vulnerability to the currently unselected resistance types*~~ ~~*Overhealed targets provide a 33% slower charge buildup rate*~~ ~~*-67% overheal buildup rate*~~ ~~Note(s): Quite a few changes here and there. Firstly is the small increase in Uber time (2.5 secs to 3 secs) just for consistency. Next is much more important: the user gains a passive resistance to the selected damage type, regardless of whether or not they're healing someone or if the Vaccinator is active. This is a godsend for smart Battle Medics, who can now choose their targets carefully and go after them with the proper damage resistance. The healing target, meanwhile, gains a small damage resistance to the selected type while being healed, but gains vulnerability elsewhere. This is mostly to help take down tanky enemies who become impossible to kill when Vacc'd (looking at you, DDS Snipers).~~ ^^^^^^^. **Bonesaw** *Level 4 Bonesaw* ~~Basic melee weapon. Deals 65 damage to enemies.~~ ~~**On hit: 12.5% of the user's Ubercharge meter is filled**~~ ~~Note(s): Another big buff! Now all Medic melees (unless specified otherwise) will provide uber buildup on melee hits. The Bonesaw takes 8 hits to completely fill the uber meter.~~ ^^^^^^^. **Ubersaw** *Level 1 Bonesaw* ~~**On hit: If the user's health is 50% or higher, 25% of the user's Ubercharge meter is filled**~~ ~~**On hit: If the user's health is lower than 50%, 50% of the user's Ubercharge meter is filled**~~ ~~*Fires 20% slower*~~ ~~*Deals 10% less damage*~~ ~~Note(s): Now that the Ubersaw isn't the only weapon that provides uber buildup on melee hits, it needs something to make it stand out. Already it builds uber much faster than default (4 hits vs 8 hits to full uber), but now, at low health, Medics can get a whopping 50% of their uber meter filled! Of course, this comes with a small nerf to damage output (though considering the Ubersaw always crits, this isn't too much of a downgrade).~~ ^^^^^^^. **Vitasaw** *Level 10 Bonesaw* ~~**On death: 20% of the Ubercharge meter built via melee hits is retained**~~ ~~*Ubercharge buildup via melee hits decreased by 60% (+5% on hit instead of 12.5% on hit)*~~ ~~*Deals 20% less damage*~~ ~~Note(s): While I doubt this will make Vitasaws legal in comp, it should now be much more useful in pubs. The uber you keep when killed depends on how much uber you built with melee hits, rather than how much uber you built overall. Of course, the melee uber buildup is smaller for compensation (20 hits vs 8 hits for full uber), and the weapon deals minimal damage. These penalties will hopefully be much more consequential than the measly -10 max health penalty it previously had.~~ ^^^^^^^. **Amputator** *Level 10 Bonesaw* ~~**While active: Constant +3 health regenerated per second**~~ ~~**On taunt: Nearby teammates regain health, increasing with time out of combat**~~ ~~**Taunt healing increase rate is not affected by damage ticks**~~ ~~*Ubercharge buildup via melee hits decreased by 20% (+10% on hit instead of 12.5% on hit)*~~ ~~*Deals 25% less damage*~~ ~~Note(s): As it currently stands, the Amputator is a bit useless as damage ticks and rampup keep the Amputator's healing abilities from reaching their maximum. With these changes, the Amputator provides more consistent health to the user and teammates, in exchange for weaker uber buildup from melee hits (10 hits vs 8 hits for full uber) and minimal damage output.~~ ^^^^^^^. **Solemn Vow** *Level 2 Bust of Hippocrates* ~~""Do no harm.""~~ ~~**User can see enemy health**~~ ~~**Deals 10% more damage**~~ ~~*Fires 15% slower*~~ ~~Note(s): I never understood the appeal of the ability to see enemy health, but it's a bonus all the same so it deserves a penalty. I feel there should be something more to it, though, so here we have a small damage bonus (it's a marble statue, after all, so I imagine that would be more damaging than just a saw that you swing once). To compensate, the firing speed penalty has been increased to 15% (up from 10%). This means you should be dealing only a slightly higher amount of damage than the default Bonesaw, assuming you land all your hits.~~"

Often, due to the minor bullet vulnerability, it is seen as an upgrade to the stock melee on the Payload and CP maps, while being a downgrade on any other map (or while playing Defense). To make it more useful as well as remove its 'upgrade or downgrade' status, I would have it grant a movement speed boost while carrying an objective (so intels, PASS balls, and Souls/Beer), at the cost of increasing the damage vulnerability. I would also allow the Pyro to equip the weapon, since it seems like something that could give him more use (and fits with the rest of his weapons, being a broken Axtinguisher handle with a railroad spike driven through it). =New Stats: ~~**+1 capture rate on wearer**~~ ~~**While Carrying an Objective: 20% faster movement speed on wearer**~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ ----- Thoughts?"

It's range (as far as I'm aware) is also 70% larger than most melee weapons, surpassing even the Demoman's swords. To make the weapon an actual side-grade (and better match a riding crop), I would remove the range bonus entirely, tweak the boost so it only affected the ally hit (while also once again affecting them for 3 seconds), having it grant a passive speed boost to the Soldier, and have it grant a passive damage vulnerability on the Soldier. =New Stats: ~~**On Ally Hit: Boost ally's movement speed by 30% for 3 seconds**~~ *No more restrictions based off class* ~~**30% movement speed boost on wearer**~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ *Applies to self-damage as well* ~~*60% damage penalty*~~ With these changes, the Disciplinary Action would continue to serve as a way to speed up allies as well as yourself, though these effects are now separated. On top of this, the Soldier using the Disciplinary Action would be better able to catch up to allies (to boost them) as well as keep up with enemies during the fight without rocket jumping, which would be good (since the vulnerability would apply to your own rockets as well). You are faster and can speed up your allies as well, but in exchange you give up some of your durability (as well as effectively any damage capabilities of your melee weapon). (Other Notes): I was also considering having a health penalty of 50 instead of a damage vulnerability, but I thought that might be too harsh; not sure what any of you might think. Also considered having the boost knock the intelligence off allies/enemies, or have knockback on enemies, but also thought better of that: as much as we would love to use it on teammates who refuse to capture or to knock the intel off an escaping enemy, it'd be too limited I feel. That, or people would constantly get whipped off cliffs or into sawblades or something. ----- Any thoughts?"

Each degree lasts 5 seconds by default~~ ~~Lower degrees will always follow higher degrees (i.e. second degree ends, first degree immediately begins)~~ ~~Grabbing health packs will only cause the present afterburn degree to end immediately.

Unfortunately, the third degree ends without going into second and first (cause I'm not an asshole) cause a full 120 AND critical hits would truly be too much. However, you can take advantage of those 5 seconds of burn with a 15% extra damage boost to the enemy that will inevitably turn around or get out of the position you got to to get to their back, plus about 65% less healing for any enemy that might get some triage! Amazing. As a plus, with the airblast now refunding your ammo should you extiguish a teammate, you can now use the expensive airblast no problem for supporting your teammates against Pyros, which should highly increase this weapon's defensive viability. However, the longer airblast time means you are now liable to not reflect well against Soldiers and Demos, as their weapons now shoot faster than you can airblast, so self-defense is now a bigger downside. Still, this should be enough extra power in the burn to compensate for. **Degreaser** *Specialty: Combos/Self-Defense* *Downfall: Debuffing/Power* ~~Afterburn: First degree~~ ~~**-65% holster time**~~ ~~**-40% deploy time**~~ ~~*Healing/Shield penalty on direct damage is now 5%/10%*~~ ~~*-25% damage (~118.1 damage/second)*~~ ~~*Deflected projectiles do not minicrit*~~ ~~*80% more particles needed to apply afterburn (20 particles)*~~ Ah the weapon that stole the stock's thunder for so long. Well here I want to give even more drawbacks due to the immense strength of granting better deploy time for your secondary and melee can give. First off, the afterburn down right sucks compared to the Stock, Backburner, and Phlog. This is coupled with the nerf to healing and shield resist reduction from direct damage with the flames. But I'm not done yet. To decrease the general power of this weapon further, deflected projectiles won't mini-crit, which means even more damage is lost. End all of that with harder to apply afterburn and you now have a flamer that needed even better aim for less damage overall, all for the upside of making your entire arsenal more powerful. Yet the damage is still high enough that light classes will still fear your fire, so it shouldn't be too bad. **Phlogistinator** *Specialty: Flanking/Clearing defense/Turning the Tables* *Downfall: Support/Self-Defense/Reliability* ~~Afterburn: Second degree~~ ~~Build up Mmmph by dealing 500 of any form of damage~~ ~~Alt-Fire: Activate Mmmph. Will taunt to activate~~ &gt; * ~~**Invulnerable to knockback and damage during the taunt**~~ &gt; * ~~**Gain guaranteed critical hits, 15% faster move speed, 30 health regen per second, and knock back invulnerability for 7 seconds (taunt no longer eats up Mmmph time)**~~ &gt; * ~~**Will strip all buffs from any hit enemies (Will not work on Ubercharges)**~~ ~~*40% shorter particle lifetime*~~ ~~*No airblast*~~ I really wanted this flamethrower to be a niche bunker buster and flanking weapon, yet still keep the weakness of having to wait around before getting off that one moment of complete death and destruction. So to increase the viability of the actual Mmmph buff by giving some tankiness and movespeed for the brief period of time Pyro becomes god. The knockback immunity is to give some better ways to get in a hunkered down position like Gravelpit point B or (to a lesser extent) point C. Also, Pyro will strip any buffs on enemies that could stop the onslaught, like Battalion's Backup. Unlike my proposed Third Degree changes, it will not work on Ubercharge buffs. As a little extra, you no longer have to deal only fire damage to gain Mmmph, meaning your options for secondary weapons open up a bit, and you can now use the buffed melees to deal so close range hurt if needed. To counter this god Pyro, the key is to stay back and focus him down as always. To further emphasize this weakness, the Phlog now has the shortest range of all Flamethrowers making it not only harder to kill people with if they run away, but to even accumulate some good damage to get your Mmmph in the first place. Overall, these changes will probably make it worse for pubs, but these balance changes aren't centered around pubs so... (nor should they be) ----------------- **Secondaries** ----------------- **Flare Gun** *Specialty: Burst Damage/Range* *Downfall: Precision/Slow* ~~Afterburn: First degree~~ Pretty simple change. Technically a nerf until you remember that the new afterburn gives extra damage and lowered healing, so a Flare Gun crit will actually do 95 damage if they were hit before hand. Plus, 5 seconds of burn as opposed to 10 is still more than enough time to do any combo or finisher that you wish. **Detonator** *Specialty: Mobility* *Downfall: Reliability* ~~Afterburn: Second degree~~ ~~Alt-Fire: Will make flare explode~~ ~~*Minicrits on burning targets instead of crits*~~ ~~*+30% self damage (Should still launch the Pyro the same height)*~~ ~~*35% slower reload (2.7 seconds)*~~ Gives Pyro some much needed mobility, which is why this I decided this needed a bit of a nerf. Specifically with the actual offensive reliability and power of the gun. Not only do you have to deal with mini-crits instead of crits but also a slower reload. Trading firepower for a better burn should be fair enough. The increased self-damage is to counteract the self damage resistance I gave the base Pyro. Hopefully the jump height is still the same. **Scorch Shot** *Specialty: Debuffing* *Downfall: Power* ~~Afterburn: First degree~~ ~~**+100% afterburn duration (60 damage total over 10 seconds)**~~ ~~**+70% flare radius when directly hitting an enemy**~~ ~~*-50% damage (15 damage)*~~ ~~*Does not crit burning targets*~~ First off, the decrease in damage, plus the self-damage resistance I gave the base Pyro should make flare jumping with this weapon non-existent, and thus donning that specialty to only the Detonator. To counteract this? You will now be rewarded with direct hits by increasing your burn influence immensely. Not only that, but with the first degree afterburn's 5% extra damage and 15% lower healing, this weapon overall becomes a far range debuffing tool that it should've been. **Manmelter** *Specialty: Support/Power/Sniping* *Downfall: Situational* ~~Afterburn: Second degree~~ ~~Alt-Fire: Use a vacuum to get rid of all degrees of afterburn on allies in a short range~~ &gt; * ~~**Each extinguished ally gives one guaranteed critical hit**~~ ~~**Does not use ammo**~~ ~~**+40% projectile speed**~~ ~~*-20% damage (24 damage, 72 critical)*~~ ~~*20% slower firing speed (2.4 seconds)*~~ ~~*Does not crit on burning targets*~~ Like the Sharpened Volcano Fragment, this is another clever way to buff a weapon indirectly through the afterburn changes. Since Flamethrowers have to airblast each degree of burn off individually now, the Manmelter, with its extinguishing all at once, is now the best way to get around the new afterburn. This alone should help it see more use. The main downside of this weapon still comes from its situational use, as only against Pyros will it be useful. However, some extra projectile speed should give it some better sniping ability. To compensate for this, some damage needed to be lost, but don't fret, cause if hitting a crit on your burnt player, you will actually deal 79 damage; not much decrease for helping your teammates right? :) **Reserve Shooter** ~~*Removed from Pyro*~~ Great! Controversy is just what I need on one of these kinds of threads, but hear me out. What the Reserve Shooter does for the Pyro far outweighs anything it does for the Soldier, we all know this. However, any changes to nerf the Reserve Shooter for Pyro will be felt by the Soldier, giving one more reason not to use it on him. I couldn't find a way to keep the Reserve's main playstyle intact without either buffing it for the Pyro too much to give something to the Soldier, or nerfing it, which will inevitably be felt by the Soldier. So this is a better solution, especially when you remember that the Reserve Shooter's stats were placed with Soldier in mind, not Pyro. **Panic Attack** *Specialty: Turning the Tables/Last Resort* *Downfall: General Use* ~~Hold Fire to load shells into the weapon and release to fire~~ &gt; * ~~*Cannot switch weapons until all shots are unloaded*~~ ~~**Up to -90% deploy time at low health (0.05 seconds minimum)**~~ ~~**Up to 85% faster reload speed at low health (0.15 seconds (first), 0.075 seconds (consecutive) minimum)**~~ ~~**Up to 85% faster firing speed at low health (0.094 seconds minimum)**~~ ~~*15% slower reload speed at full health(1.15 seconds (first), 0.575 seconds (consecutive) maximum)*~~ ~~*15% slower firing speed at full health (0.719 seconds maximum)*~~ ~~*-33% clip size*~~ ~~*+20% holster time*~~ Last, but certainly not least, the Panic Attack has gone through some buffs for a while now. However, the increased spread while at low health is without a doubt its biggest problem. Unlike other huge downsides given to weapons, this one goes against what the Panic Attack wants to do, which is kill people quickly before they kill you. So I removed it for some more lenient nerfs. While you have bullets load, you can no longer switch weapons until the clip reaches 0. This combined with the extra holster time should discourage using this weapon while not under pressure. Plus, the loading up time is slightly increased, as well as damage decreased while healthy, so it still won't be great for general purposes. However, while at low health, you might as well have a semi-automatic considering the reload and firing speeds it can get to. All without the downside of bullet spread increasing. This should give it some actual power in ""powerless"" situations with any other secondary. ------------------ This concludes my long winded and vomit/rage inducing threads on how to hopefully (but not likely) change Pyro for the better in both Highlander and 6s. Next time is Hoovy's turn. :D "

Both Soldiers and Demomen can use the Half-Zatoichi, being able to one-shot each other if both have the Zatoichi active. On the Soldier it's always been a fairly balanced weapon, since he lacks movement speed and must rely on rocket jumps to get close quickly. The Demoman, however, has the shields, which let him get guaranteed critical melee hits and passive damage resistance. Or, more importantly, can almost instantly recharge his crit charge on kill, in the case of the Tide Turner. He also gains boots that increase his maximum health and, potentially, his movement speed, as well as allowing further restoration of his charge. This leaves us with a dilemma: the weapon has no true downsides if you can kill with it or are using it in an emergency, it is balanced (if weak) on the Soldier, and it is overpowered (compared to stock) on the Demoman. Trying to balance for both classes will be nearly impossible so (though I will offer a suggestion in that vein) I would prefer to split the weapon into two different Zatoichi (similar to how the Scout and Engineer have different pistols, despite sharing the same pistol model). This would also go along with my changes to the stock melee weapons for the [Demoman](URL which leads to the following differences: * Soldier - Stock Melee (Shovel): 65 damage, 0.8 second firing speed * Demoman  Stock Melee A (Bottle): 50 damage, 0.8 second firing speed * Demoman  Stock Melee B (Sword): 65 damage, 0.8 second firing speed, 100% longer deploy/holster speed, 37% longer range =New Stats (Option A) (Used by both classes): ~~Used by Demoman and Soldier~~ ~~Demomen and Soldiers can kill each other in one shot if they both have this weapon active~~ ~~This weapon has a large melee range and deploys and holsters slower~~ ~~**On Kill: Restores 50% of max health**~~ ~~*Honorbound: Once drawn sheathing deals 50 self-damage unless it kills*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ * Cannot overheal ----- =New Stats (Option B) (Soldier Zatoichi): * Model: A short katana with a mostly-black blade with a strip of gray/white metal along the back. ~~Demomen and Soldiers can kill each other in one shot if they both have this weapon active~~ ~~**On Kill: 100% health restored and debuffs cured**~~ ~~**While Active: 25% faster movement speed**~~ ~~*While Active: User continually suffers bleeding*~~ ~~*Honorbound: Once drawn, sheathing deals self-damage equal to 50% of max health unless it kills*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ * Can be sheathed no matter what (deaths by sheathing will have a unique icon or death statement) * Cannot overheal * Bleed effect is applied when drawn and every second while active after that * Bleed effect changes: 2 damage per tick, 5 second duration, damage stacks with itself, bleeding removed by 1 second of continuous healing by a healing beam/health kits/CC bolts, victim suffers 20% damage vulnerability ----- =New Stats (Option B) (Demoman Zatoichi): * Model: A long katana with a mostly-gray/white blade with a strip of black metal along the back. ~~Demomen and Soldiers can kill each other in one shot if they both have this weapon active~~ ~~This weapon has a large melee range and deploys and holsters slower~~ ~~**On Hit: 25 health restored**~~ ~~*While Active: 20% damage vulnerability*~~ ~~*Honorbound: Once drawn, sheathing deals 50 self-damage unless it kills*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ * Can be sheathed no matter what (deaths by sheathing will have a unique icon or death statement) * Can overheal"

These bladed melees are unbalanced to one degree or another, either when combined with a shield and boots, bringing about the pure Demoknight playstyles, or when mixed with a shield and grenade launcher (the hybrid knight, the original Demoknight playstyle). The typical stats of the Demoman's bladed melee weapons are as follows: * Damage: 65 * Swing Speed: 0.8 seconds * Taunt: Execution (Kill taunt) * 37% longer melee range * 100% longer deploy speed * 100% longer holster speed (guessing on the speeds, since I haven't found the actual numbers anywhere. Feels right though) * No random critical hits =(The Zatoichi isn't included here intentionally. That weapon can be found [here](URL If I may mention: one idea I had was removing the 'no random crits' attribute from the swords and placing it on the shields, since the shields are what enable guaranteed crits on melee weapons, not the weapons themselves (putting it on the shields would apply it to all weapons the demoman is currently carrying, including his grenade launchers). Any thoughts? ----- **Eyelander** =Current Stats: ~~This weapon has a large melee range and deploys and holsters slower~~ ~~*-25 max health on wearer*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~Gives increased speed and health with every head you take~~ * Health Bonus per Head: 15, capped at 60 * Speed Bonus per Head: 8%, capped at 32% * Shield Bash Bonus per Head: 10%, capped at 50% The Eyelander was the first melee unlock for the demoman. It boasts the typical increased sword range as well as the slowed switch speeds, as well as a passive health penalty. The benefits it offers, however, are quite massive if the player can take advantage of them: for every melee kill, the sword will collect a head. For every head collected, the Demoman will move 8% faster and have 15 more max health, capping at 4 heads (subsequent melee kills will restore 15 health each, as well as continue to increase the head counter). The number of collected heads will also increase the ramming damage done by any equipped shield by 10% per head, this one capping at 5 heads. These bonuses never decay, only resetting if the Demoman wielding the weapon swaps it out for something else or is killed. Many have called the weapon overpowered, since getting two heads completely removes every downside besides the lack of random crits and the slower switch speeds (minor, considering players should rarely be using their melee and Demoknights usually only have a melee weapon+shield for combat), and the bonuses don't decay overtime like other 'chargeable' effects. I am inclined to agree, which is why I'd suggest a change to how the 'Heads' mechanic works, as well as an new penalty to movement speed. =New Stats: ~~This weapon has a large melee range and deploys and holsters slower~~ ~~*-25 max health on wearer*~~ ~~*-10% movement speed on wearer*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~Gives increased speed and health with every head you take. Drains health if you have no heads.~~ * Health Bonus per Head: 15, capped at 75 * Speed Bonus per Head: 8%, capped at 40% * Shield Bash Bonus per Head: 10%, capped at 50% * Passive Health Decay: Up to 4 per second. The drain rate increases the longer you stay out of combat (same rate as the Concheror and Medic regeneration). Reaches -4 per second after 10 seconds out of combat. * Passive Head Decay Speed: every 10 seconds without a melee kill (lose 1 head for every 10 seconds that go by without you getting a melee kill on someone). These changes would allow the Demoman to potentially have 225 to 250 health alongside a Scout-challenging movement speed. However, unlike currently, these bonuses would only be temporary, requiring you to gain multiple melee kills to maintain the boost. In addition, the weapon will now also slow down your movement speed to start out, and will drain your health until you gain your first head, penalizing you for staying out of combat or retreating. ----- **Scotsman's Skullcutter** =Current Stats: ~~This weapon has a large melee range and deploys and holsters slower~~ ~~**20% damage bonus**~~ ~~*While Active: 15% slower movement speed*~~ The Skullcutter holds a distinguishing position among the Demoman's melee weapons: it is the only one that can randomly crit. Combined with its increased damage, it is able to one-shot any non-Heavy class (save an overhealed Soldier). The slowed movement speed alongside the slowed switch while active helps keep this in check, as you can't just run up to someone and quickly whack them for a solid 78 or 234 damage, depending on if you crit or not. While a solid weapon, I personally dislike how the movement speed penalty is now a passive penalty. I personally prefer melee weapons, when their stats affect the user's health or mobility, to have their stats be passive, rather than active, as making them active makes it far easier for them to effectively upgrades to the stock options (though I admit that the slower switch-speeds counter this in the cases of the Demoman's blades). However, since a passive downside also shouldn't exist without a passive upside, I'd think it's only fair to grant a passive upside to the Skullcutter as well: in this case, a +25 health bonus. =New Stats: ~~This weapon has a large melee range and deploys and holsters slower~~ ~~**+25 max health on wearer**~~ ~~**20% damage bonus**~~ ~~*15% slower movement speed*~~ With these changes, you are effectively a Grenade Launcher/Sticky Launcher-wielding Soldier, sharing his health and moving only 1% slower. The increased health gives you some boosted survivability and, if you get forced into a melee fight, will allow you to survive a melee crit from most weapons if you are at full health. The slower switch and slowed movement speed still keep this weapon from being an upgrade, but the boosted health does expand on how much the weapon can be used. ----- **Claidheamh Mr** =Current Stats: ~~This weapon has a large melee range and deploys and holsters slower~~ ~~**On Kill: 25 health restored (cannot overheal)**~~ ~~**On Kill: 25% of charge restored**~~ ~~*While Active: 15% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ The Claid we know now is effectively an entirely new weapon added in the Tough Break update, as it removed the weapon's signature boost to how long you could charge, as well as exchanging the health penalty for a damage vulnerability while active. In exchange for the loss of the boosted charge, the Claid now restores a small amount of health and charge on kill. If I may perform some necromancy (just let me get Merasmus, the Scout and Archimedes over here to assist the Medic and I), I would like to return the Claid to its original state, or at least something similar. Let's see: =New Stats: ~~This weapon has a large melee range and deploys and holsters slower~~ ~~**Crits when it would mini-crit**~~ ~~**With Shield: 50% longer charge duration**~~ ~~**Without Shield: 15% faster movement speed on wearer**~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ So, at the cost of a passive damage vulnerability the Demoman cannot negate (unlike the Eyelander's health penalty) and no random crits, the Claid will crit when it will mini-crit (increasing the time in which it can crit with a shield charge), and can either increase the duration of shield charges to 3 seconds or can increase the Demoman's movement speed to that of Medic, depending on whether or not he has a shield. ----- **Persian Persuader** =Current Stats: ~~This weapon has a large melee range and deploys and holsters slower~~ ~~**Ammo boxes collected give charge**~~ ~~**On Hit: Refills 20% of charge**~~ ~~*80% less max primary ammo on wearer*~~ ~~*80% less max secondary ammo on wearer*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ The Persuader has been reworked from its original stats, which converted ammo to health and completely removed your ability to gather more ammo for your Launchers (save from resupply lockers). In both its original incarnation and current incarnation it's had no downside for Demoknights, while having a disproportionate downside for your guns (more severe now, as you will never have more than a clip and only 3 to 5 bombs in reserve, depending on the launcher). Its upside isn't as effective now either, as your shield charge already recharges automatically, and only hitting an enemy (without killing them) is a surefire way to get yourself killed. I would prefer to change it back to how it was before (ammo collected is converted to health instead of ammo and no ammo reserve penalties). Rather than return the faster recharge however, I would replace the current 'on hit' restoration with a larger 'on kill' restoration, effectively simulating what the blade did before (and improving on it if you can kill quickly). I would also allow for melee kills to restore ammo. As for downsides (besides not being able to collect ammo from crates), I would reduce the amount of health restored by healers and health packs (including ammo crates). =New Stats: ~~This weapon has a large melee range and deploys and holsters slower~~ ~~**On Kill: 50% of ammo for all equipped weapons restored**~~ ~~**On Kill: 50% of charge restored**~~ ~~*-25 less max health on wearer*~~ ~~*50% less health from healers on wearer*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~Ammo collected restores health instead of ammo~~ * Ammo crates and Dispensers restore health at an equal rate to their health-focused counter parts These changes should allow for a far more aggressive playstyle (as is typical of the Demoman's blades), allowing you to once again bombard enemies and set traps while also allowing you a (still dangerous) method of reloading your weapons. The rapid charging potential and new overabundance of medium health packs is balanced, however, by the penalties to your health and health recovery, as Medics won't be able to reliably heal you (Dispensers are relatively unaffected, since their ammo-dispensing capabilities will burst heal you in addition to its penalized standard heal). ----- Thoughts?"

It also has a quicker holster speed to emphasize its utility nature and to encourage users to use other weapons for actual damage. For penalties, the weapon retains the older damage penalty, gains 100 HP less from overheals to discourage pocketing, and has a reduced health regeneration rate to encourage use of the Natascha in the regen function's place.)~~ ^^^^^^^. **Brass Beast** *Level 1 Minigun* ~~**+25% faster firing rate**~~ ~~**+50% primary ammo**~~ ~~*30% slower spin-up speed*~~ ~~*10% slower movement speed on user*~~ ~~*50% less damage resistance from continuous fire*~~ ~~(Notes: The Brass Beast now no longer makes you a living sentry. The negligible damage bonus is replaced with a faster firing rate, which should result in higher damage dealt overall if you land your shots. To make up for the ammo consumption this will cause, you now start with 300 primary ammo instead of 200. The penalties, too, have been reduced; the spin-up rate is the same as the old Natascha, and instead of a terrible movement speed while the weapon is spun up, the user is slightly slower overall. The user also receives much less damage resistance from continuous fire, for a max bonus of 10% damage resistance. This is to encourage users to turtle less and to kill more.)~~ ^^^^^^^. **Tomislav** *Level 10 Minigun* ~~**20% faster revving speed**~~ ~~**20% more accurate**~~ ~~**Silent Killer: No revved-up noise after initial spin up**~~ ~~*Fires 20% slower*~~ ~~(Notes: Nothing changed here, except for the damage resistance from continuous fire added for all miniguns. The Tomislav already works well as a good side-grade to the Minigun when you need to be quick and stealthy, and that shouldn't change.)~~ ^^^^^^^. **Huo-Long Heater** *Level 2 Minigun* ~~**On hit: victim is ignited by fire, sustaining 5 seconds of weak afterburn**~~ ~~**Press Reload while spun-up to ""puff"" a special team-colored Ring of Fire around the user**~~ ~~**Holding Reload keeps the Ring of Fire sustained**~~ ~~**Deals minicrits vs players 1 second after they are ignited by fire**~~ ~~*20% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*10% less accurate*~~ ~~*Ring of Fire costs 4 ammo to activate and 4 ammo per second to sustain*~~ ~~Unlisted: Afterburn inflicted by Ring of Fire can only be extinguished by resupply lockers~~ ~~(Notes: Instead of it being default, the Huo-Long Heater's Ring of Fire can now be activated and controlled by the user; this should be more helpful for close range defense as well as personal spychecking. The Ring of Fire now permanently damages enemies hurt by the weapon, unless they can head back to their spawn room and remove it. In addition, the minigun can briefly ignite enemies, and afterburn victims take minicrit damage from this weapon 1 second after they are ignited. As trade offs, the weapon has a slow firing rate and lowered accuracy, so your shots will have to count. The ammo consumption is refitted for the new Ring of Fire functions, but essentially amounts to the same penalty as before.)~~ ^^^^^^^. **Shotgun** *Level 4 Pump-Action Rifle* ~~Standard mercenary weapon. Holds six bullets at a time, each firing in spread shots.~~ ~~**Heavies deploy all shotguns 15% faster (does not stack)**~~ ~~(Notes: Of course mostly unchanged, as this is a multi-class weapon. Took the time to add here, though, that ALL shotguns on the Heavy may be switched to faster. Shotguns on Heavies have always been emergency weapons, so it would make more sense for Heavies specifically to have a universal faster deployment speed on all their shotguns.)~~ ^^^^^^^. **Family Business** *Level 1 Pump-Action Rifle* ~~**+33% larger clip**~~ ~~**+15% faster firing speed**~~ ~~*Deals 15% less damage*~~ ~~(Notes: No direct changes here, either. The Family Business is solid. Still gets the passive bonus for all shotguns listed above, of course.)~~ ^^^^^^^. **Panic Attack** *Level 10 Drum-Magazine Rifle* ~~**50% faster reload speed**~~ ~~**This weapon deploys 50% faster**~~ ~~**Holds up to 4 shells that fire rapidly, with increasing speed as health decreases**~~ ~~**Weapon spread increases as health decreases**~~ ~~(Notes: Same here. Didn't think I'd say this about a year ago, but the Panic Attack is pretty solid as well. Should be noted, however, that the deployment bonus on this weapon remains at 50%, considering the deployment bonus above does not stack.)~~ ^^^^^^^. **Sandvich** *Level 2 Lunch Item* ~~A sandwich. Press Fire to perform an eating taunt for 3 seconds, consuming the item for 30 seconds. Press Alt-Fire to toss this item to the ground, where it may heal allies with the bonus of a medium health pack. Sandvich recharge time may be negated by finding a health pack, or halved by letting a teammate consume one.~~ ~~**On consumption by user when below 100% health: Restores up to 300 health**~~ ~~**On consumption by user when at 100% health or more: Perform a brief taunt with no effect and retain the Sandvich for future use.**~~ ~~**Users who step on a tossed sandvich, including one they toss on their own, heal 100 HP and have afterburn extinguished**~~ ~~(Notes: The old toss-and-heal method is back! While the health regained this way has been reduced to 100 from 150, the afterburn extinguishing factor remains. In addition, sharing a Sandvich with a teammate is now encouraged, thanks to the halved recharge time one gets when a teammate picks up your tossed Sandvich. Lastly, Sandvich consumption time has been slightly reduced from 4 seconds to 3 seconds, just as a slight buff.)~~ ^^^^^^^. **Dalokohs Bar** *Level 4 Chocolate Bar* ~~**Cardiac Killer: Can eat once at 50% charge and twice at 100% charge**~~ ~~**May toss this item twice, losing 50% charge with each toss**~~ ~~**+66% faster consumption speed**~~ ~~*66% less health restored on consumption*~~ ~~*When tossed: acts as a small health pack instead of a medium health pack*~~ ~~*50% less recharge bar restored from teammates picking up tossed sandviches*~~ ~~Unlisted: Tossed items refill recharge bar by 50% instead of providing health and removing afterburn~~ ~~(Notes: Basically a quicker version of the Sandvich. You can eat this twice, taking a very quick bite to immediately gain 100 HP back with each consumption for a total of 200 possible health you can restore. This is for emergencies, when you REALLY need to get some health back fast but can't find a safe spot to eat your normal Sandvich. Users can also toss twice as many Sandviches to teammates for less health, so as to help more folks out than just one. The user, meanwhile, gets less of a reduced recharge time from teammates picking up sandviches. The user also cannot get rid of afterburn or heal immediately from tossing their items to the ground.)~~ ^^^^^^^. **Buffalo Steak Sandvich** *Level 1 Steak* ~~**50% faster consumption speed**~~ ~~**On consumption: Melee attacks deal guaranteed minicrits for the duration of the effect (user may still deal full crits)**~~ ~~**On consumption: While melee is deployed, user moves 25% faster for the duration of the effect, and gains 5% movement speed with each kill (max 20% extra, total 45%)**~~ ~~**Above effects are increased by 5 seconds with each kill**~~ ~~*On consumption: User is locked to melee for 15 seconds*~~ ~~*No health restored on consumption*~~ ~~Initial consumption effects last for at least 15 seconds.~~ ~~(Notes: Now THIS is more like it. Eat this to gain faster speed, minicrits from melee damage, and locked-melee status for at least 15 seconds. Speed bonus and melee minicrits may be extended with each kill, meaning you can retain them after the locked melee status is lost. HOWEVER, they are ONLY active when the melee is out. So even if you are freed from the locked melee status, you will still have to switch back to the melee in order to get these bonuses, for however long they last. The BSS is also eaten faster now for quicker utilization, and has no damage vulnerability penalty because that penalty is stupid - something I think we can all agree on.)~~ ^^^^^^^. **Fists** *Level 10 Fists* ~~Basic melee weapon of the Heavy. Deals basic melee damage to enemies.~~ ~~Unlisted: Pressing Fire throws the left hand forward, and pressing Alt-Fire throws the right hand forward. This is merely an aesthetic effect.~~ ~~(Notes: Nothing to change here.)~~ ^^^^^^^. **Killing Gloves of Boxing** *Level 2 Boxing Gloves* ~~**On kill: User deals guaranteed critical hits on all weapons for 5 seconds**~~ ~~*10% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~(Notes: It's surprising that the KGB hasn't gotten the infamous ""no random crits"" stat, but I think, maybe it's time it got that. Now, I dunno about you, but the slower firing speed of the KGB kind of makes getting the crits difficult outside of Medieval Mode - so now, here we go, with a reduced penalty of only 10% instead of the old 20% slower firing speed.)~~ ^^^^^^^. **Gloves of Running Urgently** *Level 4 Boxing Gloves* ~~**While active: 30% faster movement speed on user (stacks)**~~ ~~*-50 max health on user*~~ ~~*Max overheal reduced to 350 HP*~~ ~~*Deals 25% less damage*~~ ~~*No base health regeneration on user*~~ ~~(Notes: Damage vulnerability and slower deployment speed tossed out in favor of lowered health on the user. The reason this weapon is disregarded in competitive play is because it allows the user to get to objectives with a high wall of health, thus the tradeoff here should negate that. The user also loses their health regeneration bonus, so they'll either have to rely on a Medic - which they most likely already will in competitive play - or utilize the Natascha for a health bonus of any sort.)~~ ^^^^^^^. **Warrior's Spirit** *Level 1 Bear Arms* ~~While active:~~ ~~**Deals 30% more damage**~~ ~~**On kill: 100 health is restored (may overheal this way)**~~ ~~*+10% damage vulnerability on user*~~ ~~*-1 health gained from health regen (now: min +2 HP per second, max +5 HP per second)*~~ ~~(Notes: A questionable tool before, now becomes an excellent tool for healing. A negligible bonus of 50 HP has been increased to 100 HP that may overheal the user, encouraging use of the item in clutch moments. The damage vulnerability, too, has been reduced to 10%, so as to punish player less for getting in close, which you'll obviously be doing with melee weapons...meanwhile, the user gets less base health regen while the weapon is active. Pairing this with the Natascha means no health regen while the weapon is active, which I imagine this new weapon would be used this way often.)~~ ^^^^^^^. **Fists of Steel** *Level 10 Metallic Gloves* ~~**40% damage resistance vs ranged attacks**~~ ~~*100% damage vulnerability vs melee attacks*~~ ~~*User cannot capture intelligence or defend control points*~~ ~~(Notes: Mostly left unchanged, however the slower switch penalty has been tossed out and, in it's place, the user can't capture intel or defend points. They still may, however, capture points and push carts.)~~ ^^^^^^^. **Eviction Notice** *Level 2 Brass Knuckles* ~~**40% faster firing speed**~~ ~~**While active: 15% faster movement speed on user (stacks)**~~ ~~**35% faster weapon switch speed on user**~~ ~~*Deals 60% less damage*~~ ~~(Notes: I always loved the EN for its quick and weak attacks, but the damage vulnerability and speed boost make no sense. Maybe one taken away from the other might be sensible, but together they're just...bizarre. Why be vulnerable to damage when you get a bonus for being in close range, where you're susceptible to damage the most...? In any case, both have been removed, and instead a switch speed bonus has been given to the user. Makes this weapon good for all-around utility, in exchange for its very weak damage output.)~~ ^^^^^^^. **Holiday Punch** *Level 4 Festive Gloves* ~~**On critical hit: victims are forced to perform a laughing taunt**~~ ~~**Guaranteed critical hits from behind**~~ ~~*Critical hits deal no damage*~~ ~~Users wearing the Holiday Punch will always laugh when hit by this weapon~~ ~~(Notes: Holiday Punch is one of my favourite weapons, simply because it's fun. I'm not gonna mess with it, lest we end up with another Caber situation...)~~"

Like many of the Medic's weapons, they can effectively be called upgrades to stock (save for the Quick-Fix, which is a side-grade to the other Medi Guns like rest of the Medic's secondaries). I would change these weapons to further improve healing, while making the Medic more vulnerable. ----- =[General Medic Changes](URL * Movement Speed increased to 110% * berCharges no longer affect the Medic while he is healing a patient. * A Medic who is not healing a patient during an berCharge will instead ber himself, even if he switches weapons (meaning a Medic can now do things such as combo a Kritz+Syringe Gun on himself). * During an active berCharge, the Medic will be healed (and potentially overhealed) by his equipped Medi Gun, if possible. ----- **Overdose** =Current Stats: ~~*15% damage penalty*~~ ~~While active, movement speed increases based on berCharge percentage, to a maximum of +20%~~ The Overdose is an upgrade to the stock Syringe Gun. Suffering from a negligible damage penalty, it allows the Medic to have an escape tool if their patient is killed or a situation otherwise sours. I would change the Overdose to apply the full speed boost to the patient and Medic, as well as a boost to damage resistance, but only while the berCharge is active. As for a downside, I'm thinking reduced max health on the Medic. =New Stats: ~~**berCharges now grants 20% faster movement speed and 20% damage resistance to patient**~~ ~~**While Active: 20% faster movement speed**~~ ~~*-25 max health on wearer*~~ ----- **Solemn Vow** =Current Stats: ~~**Allows you to see enemy health [and name and berCharge]**~~ ~~*10% slower firing speed*~~ The Solemn Vow is effectively a minor upgrade to the Bonesaw, allowing you to see enemy health and, for Medic's, their ber, similar to the Spy. This is apparently very powerful in Comp, as it allows Medics to callout the enemy Medic's current berCharge as well as call out weakened enemies. I'd like to put more emphasis on the 'Do No Harm' bit of the Solemn Vow; let's see: health regeneration reset when dealing damage, rather than when receiving it, and a damage vulnerability when not healing. I'd also give it a modified Kritzkrieg taunt, allowing the Medic to heal himself with his own Medi Gun for one second, at the Medigun's current heal rate (stock Medi Gun would restore 24 health in this instance, for instance). =New Stats: ~~**Health regeneration does not reset when damaged**~~ ~~*When not Healing: 20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ ~~*Health regeneration reset upon dealing damage*~~ ----- **Quick-Fix** =Current Stats: ~~berCharge triples healing and grants immunity to movement-impairing effects~~ ~~**40% faster heal rate**~~ ~~**10% faster berCharge rate**~~ ~~*50% less max overheal*~~ ~~Mirror blast jumps and shield charges of patients~~ The Quick-Fix is a powerful weapon. It increases your healing rate heavily, as well as lightly increasing your berCharge rate, and allows you to increase your mobility by by mimicking Soldier/Demoman blast jumps and shield charges; the berCharge itself triples the already heavy healing rate and makes it impossible for you and your patient to be moved by knockback or airblasts, and makes both of you immune to stuns and slowdown. I've always found the Quick-Fix to be decently designed, but I feel the stats should be switched with the Vaccinator (which I will go into further below). A Quick-Fix comes across as something that will only protect you and your patient for a short time, rather than something that will quickly get you back in the fight (though that will probably be the end result regardless). Never liked the mirroring-effects either: very easy for your movement to be fucked with if a Soldier or Demo unexpectedly blast jumps (or charges, for Demomen), while the speed boost from latching onto Scouts allows the Medic to be a bit too mobile (in my eyes at least). My redesign will slightly improve the Quick-Fix's higher heal rate, but reduce the berCharge rate and remove overheal. However, like the Vaccinator, the Quick-Fix will have it's ber split into 4 sections (2 seconds each instead of 2.5 seconds each) that will remain active even if the Medic stops healing the patient or switches to a different weapon. Pressing 'Reload' will change the type of damage being resisted, and the berCharge will grant temporary and limited damage resistance and crit immunity to the resisted damage =New Stats: ~~**50% faster heal rate**~~ ~~**On Patient: 25% damage resistance**~~ ~~*25% slower berCharge rate*~~ ~~*Cannot generate or maintain overheal*~~ ~~berCharge grants a 2 second resistance bubble that grants 75% damage resistance to the Medic and patient~~ * Healing Rate: 36 HP/s (in combat) to 108 HP/s (10 seconds out of combat) * Base Ubercharge Rate: 1.875% per second (roughly 53 seconds to reach 100%) * Ubercharge needed for 1 Ubercharge: 25% (roughly 13 seconds of charging) * berCharge damage resistance does not stack with damage resistance granted by healing * Bubble can be 'stacked' on one target up to 4 times, enabling it to still grant an 8 second uber (one that doesn't have to be actively maintained either). * Quick-Fix uber now has a hud icon for the patient (a Bandage). This icon will light up when player has an active ubercharge, and will have a 'x2', 'x3', or 'x4' if the uber is 'stacked' with itself. ----- **Vaccinator** =Current Stats: ~~Press 'RELOAD' to cycle through different resistance types~~ ~~**67% faster berCharge rate**~~ ~~**Provides patient and Medic with 10% resistance to the selected damage type while healing**~~ ~~*33% slower berCharge rate on overhealed patients*~~ ~~*66% slower overheal rate*~~ ~~berCharge grants a 2.5 second resistance bubble that grants 75% base damage and 100% crit damage of the selected damage type to the Medic and patient~~ The Vaccinator is a weapon that is difficult to utilize but potentially powerful, so long as you are fine with a bit of micro-management for your resistances. Like I said above, I find that the Quick-Fix and Vaccinator should have their bers switched, more or less. My new Vaccinator would heal slowly but build ber rapidly, with the overheal penalties removed. ber would still be split into 4 separate berCharges, but with different effects. These would be: a burst heal on ber, an instant curing of and protection from all debuffs, knockback immunity and a movement speed boost. =New Stats: ~~**50% faster berCharge rate**~~ ~~*25% slower heal rate*~~ ~~berCharge grants a 2 second buff to the patient and Medic, instantly healing the patient for triple the base healing rate, granting debuff and knockback immunity, stopping overheal decay and boosting movement speed by 20%~~ * Heal Rate: 18 HP/s (in combat) to 54 HP/s (10 seconds out of combat) * Base Ubercharge Rate: 3.75% (roughly 26 seconds to reach 100% uber) * Ubercharge needed for 1 Ubercharge: 25% (roughly 6 seconds of charging) * Uber Burst Heal: 54 * Debuffs Removed and Negated: Marked for Death; Jarate; Mad Milk; Afterburn; Bleed; Plague; Slowdown; Stun * Ubercharge Buff can be 'stacked' on one target up to 4 times, enabling it to still grant an 8 second uber (one that doesn't have to be actively maintained either). * Quick-Fix uber now has a hud icon for the patient (a Needle). This icon will light up when player has an active ubercharge, and will have a 'x2', 'x3', or 'x4' if the uber is 'stacked' with itself. ----- Edit 1: Extended the new Quick-Fix damage resistance to cover all forms of damage and removed resistance cycling.

UC increases cap rate of both healer and patient to x3. After 8 seconds, this becomes x2. After 15 seconds, this becomes x1. The speed-boost +50% is eg. from 80% to 130% or from 107% to 157%. It decreases at a gradual, steady pace, from +50% to +30% over 15 seconds. After 15 seconds, the effects completely wear off. Note: The Medic and Patient can obviously cap when they are UCed, unlike with other Medi Guns.) Summary: With this Medi Gun, you'll be charging UC incredibly slowly. However, the UC can practically guarantee capture of points/flags and is potentially more powerful than Stock or the Kritzkrieg. To compensate for not having a defensive Uber, the weapon has a passive effect active when the healing beam is attached. However, the passive effect gives resistances and vulnerabilities. In this way, a Medic must decide whether or not to heal a player, depending on the enemies he can see. The faster Overheal build helps to sustain Overheal between disconnecting and connecting the beam constantly (which will reduce your Overheal build rate anyway). It also helps with pushes and moving out of spawn. **The Inspiration Injector** *Level 8 Medical Apparatus* ~~berCharge increases the capture rate of the Medic and Patient by up to +200% and increases their movement speed by up to +50% over a period of 15 seconds.~~ ~~**+50% Overheal build rate**~~ ~~**+35% resistance for the Medic and Patient to explosives while healing beam is attached**~~ ~~*-15% berCharge rate*~~ ~~*+35% vulnerability for the Medic and Patient to bullets and fire while healing beam is attached*~~ ~~*berCharge effects slowly deteriorate after activated*~~ ~~Gewalt ist nicht die Antwort.

Stores 2-8 shots in a clip. each +50% will grant +1 ammo in a clip. This weapon DOES NOT reload all of its shots at once. The damage of each Syringe is the same as the Force-A-Nature's pellets. The amount of Syringes per shot is 10.) Summary: This weapon offers an alternative to Crossbows and Assault Rifles (Syringe Guns). This weapon is a projectile-based Shotgun for the Medic. It fires 10 syringes in a Shotgun-like cone that are 50% closer together than a regular Shotgun. Each shot is fired at a 50% faster interval than a regular Shotgun and deals the same damage as a regular Shotgun. However, you only have 2 shots in a clip with 8 in reserve. Obviously, this isn't a lot. Also, your weapon doesn't reload all the shots at once, for very good reason. The defining stat of this weapon is its ability to increase its clip size by 1 for every 2 kills made by your heal target. Players that contributed to your clip will also get rid of their contribution once they die. You will obviously also lose all your clip size increase upon death. The clip size goes up to 8 shots with 8 reserve, allowing you to do barrages of shotgun shots with a 50% faster firing speed and 50% more accuracy. To balance this, the weapon doesn't reload all of its shots at once, initially and afterwards. **The Coroner's Condolences** *Level 5 Medical License* ~~Each kill made by the heal target will increase the clip size by 25%.

[Kill yourself before they do. Become a ghost and haunt your enemies. Respawn.] [If you've ever played Medic, you'll have heard about things such as ""overextending"" or ""being too cautious"". Being too cautious is when you play it safe too often, leading to fewer pushes and poorer results. Overextending can cause a waste of time, effort, and Charge, due to either getting yourself killed or by running away from enemies for ridiculous amounts of time. With this weapon, the ability to kill yourself is basically a completely irreversible decision that will allow you to rampage around and stun people after dead, then respawn 10 seconds later. You will always respawn after 10 seconds and you will be then able to get back into the fight. The part about getting back to the fight might be negated if your team has a Teleporter up. Essentially, what this weapon breaks down to is killing yourself earlier if you know that you're already going to die in vain. This weapon will introduce more thoughtful gameplay from Medics as they learn to predict and decide their fates at the touch of a button. Sometimes, the Suicide can be beneficial (a successful acceptance of defeat, followed by a short rampage and quick return to battle afterwards) or detrimental (an unsuccessful acceptance of defeat, wherein you would have been able to fight for longer, kill a few people, finish the objective, deploy a Charge, etc., if you hadn't killed yourself). This weapon requires extremely good judgement to use.] Summary: This weapon will allow you to kill yourself by pressing Alt-Fire. Usually, killing yourself would be a last resort if you are either going to die to enemy hands anyway or are wasting a lot of time running away from enemies or getting out of various sticky situations. If you do decide to kill yourself, you'll go into a ghost phase where you spend the entirety of your respawn time trying to stun/slowdown enemies. After 10 seconds are up, you'll respawn with a 10 second berCharge build rate penalty (50% slower). The weapon also deals -50% damage. **The Death Wish** *Level 10 Razor* ~~Upon suicide, you will transform into a ghost for 10 seconds. In ghost form, you can stun your enemies by touch.

You give up your reliable ranged self-defense weapon (which gets to be used less and less the better you get with the Sniper Rifle) and gain a powerful debuff weapon that can be applied at a decent range to a group of enemies that is difficult to dodge (due to the splash radius). It isn't a game-breaking weapon, but it does make the Sniper more capable of self-defense than otherwise (since Jarate will often force the victim to back off), as well as making him far too effective at assisting against groups. While not a game-breaking weapon (though like usual I can't speak for Comp), it is broken by its design. I have a few stats in mind, some of which I am sure should be added, and others I am undecided on, which will be mentioned below. All are meant for the express purpose of bringing it more in-line with the shields/backpack and SMGs (primarily on pubs) and reducing its massive debuffing power. =Added/Changed Stats: * Projectile Speed: 1,024 ft/s (64 ft/s) * Starts with no charge. * Cannot be recharged at a Resupply Locker * Jarate can't be 'healed off' by Medi beams * Jarate can be washed off by water or any friendly 'soaking' item (Jarate or Mad Milk) at the cost of soaking the target for 5 seconds (the water effect, not the item's debuff), or dried by the Degreaser's airblast. * The user can coat themselves in their own Jarate if caught in the blast (better make sure you killed that Pyro before you try to extinguish yourself!) * Removed the faster recharge on extinguish =Other Suggested Stat Changes: * A): Reduce Splash Radius to: 4.5 ft (72 HU) * B): Replace mini-crits with a penalty of 50% damage vulnerability (no longer removes damage falloff) * C): Reduce the duration to 5 seconds ----- I have mentioned my changes to the Bushwacka in [another post](URL but I will mention it here as well, since it would also be heavily affected by the Jarate change: **Bushwacka** =Current Stats: ~~**Crits when it would mini-crit**~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~*While Active: 20% damage vulnerability*~~ The Bushwacka, on its own, is a good sidegrade to the Kukri. No random crits, and you are more susceptible to damage while it's active, but you can also take advantage of enemies vulnerable to mini-crits to take them out. However, this balance becomes overpowered when mixed with two of the Sniper's secondaries: Jarate and the Cleaner's Carbine. Both grant the Sniper guaranteed mini-crits, allowing the Sniper to be come a crit machine for a couple seconds; each strike dealing 195 damage. Within four strikes every class, even a fully overhealed Heavy, will fall to this weapon. Not only is this a bit overpowered, but it also doesn't balance well with the rest of the set, which trades damage and self-defense for durability or team support. The Bushwacka should continue this trend; for this, I would suggest it increase the Sniper's movement speed while active, allowing it to be used as an escape tool, or a method of keeping distance in a melee fight (besides that, I already gave the 'crits when it would mini-crit' attribute to the Sleeper, where it seems more fitting); this would take advantage of the DDS's increased durability, as well as allow for easier positioning/escaping with the Sleeper and other rifles. =New Stats: ~~**While Active: 20% faster movement speed**~~ ~~**20% damage bonus**~~ ~~*While Active: 20% damage vulnerability*~~"

Not only do they fail to flow as a set, they're terrible. The boost vanishes in a second, and while the health on hit is nice with the PB&amp;J the damage penalty not only painful but it ruins your boost as well. From my own personal testing, you need to deal 100 damage to fill your boost, and only need to take 25. 25 damage. 2 shots from a pistol and the one benefit of this weapon is gone. So with this wall of text out of the way, here are my changes. Current: **THE BABY FACE'S BLASTER** *Level 10 Scattergun* ~~**On Hit: Builds Boost**~~ (100 damage) ~~**Run speed increases with Boost**~~ ~~*-34% clip size*~~ (4 shots) ~~*10% slower move speed on wearer*~~ ~~*Boost reduced on air jumps*~~ ~~*Boost reduced when hit*~~ (25 damage) New: **THE BABY FACE'S BLASTER** *Level 10 Scattergun* ~~**On Hit: Builds Boost**~~ (100 damage) ~~**Run speed increases with Boost**~~ ~~*-34% clip size*~~ (4 shots) ~~*10% slower move speed on wearer*~~ ~~*Boost reduced when hit*~~ (1/5 per hit) What does this do? Firstly I removed the double jump penalty. Even in it's prime I hated that stat. The weapon that gives scout even more mobility removes his largest source of mobility. As for the boost reduced when hit, I like it. While waaay too harsh, it adds a skill element: don't get hit, run fast. But here's how it works: every shot you take damage from reduces boost by 1/5th. While weapons like the scattergun shoot 9 hitscan projectiles, it would be registered as one hit. This means consistent damage weapons get an edge over you. But burst damage weapons like rocket launchers, scatterguns etc. lag behind. As the publicity blurb says, it's meant to take on big guns. &gt;Aaah this gun takes me back. Roaming the streets, shooting up anything or anyone I felt like, being on the run from the law, hiding out while the big guns sweep through then BAM! YOU'RE DEAD PAL! Oh wait, that was yesterday. I have the best. Job. EVER! Now for the PBPP Current: **PRETTY BOY'S POCKET PISTOL** *Level 10 Pistol* ~~When weapon is active:~~ ~~**On Hit: Gain up to +5 health**~~ ~~**Wearer never takes falling damage**~~ ~~*25% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ New: **PRETTY BOY'S POCKET PISTOL** *Level 10 Pistol* ~~**+15 health**~~ ~~**This weapon deploys 50% faster**~~ ~~*-50% clip size*~~ Once again the purpose of this weapon is completely changed. Based off the [Colt Model 1908 Vest Pocket](URL used by gangster Charles ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd, the 1908 was &gt;a small concealable firearm which could be easily tucked into a vest pocket for unobtrusive carry. With only 4 shots, the BFB doesn't always get the job done. In that case, you can quickly pull out this tiny gun and finish off a target. But with only 6 shots, it can't really hold it's own and is stuck as a finisher. The health increase was returned to give you even more of an edge against burst damage classes, and the damage penalty was too painful to deal with, plus the -6 shots ballances it just fine. EDIT: If -6 shots is too big a deal, an alternative would be only -4, but added bullet spread. This would make it more useful in close quarters where you would be finishing a target off, but no good at range."

The upside is so powerful that it needs a severe passive penalty to balance it, along with the addition of a passive upside to stop the weapon from becoming useless with a harsh passive downside. This new powerjack would be focused on making it easier for the pyro to survive away from his team. The speed boost while the powerjack is active would allow a pyro to move swiftly around the map and flank behind his enemies easier. On a kill with any of the pyro's weapons, the pyro is rewarded with 30 HP (which can go into overheal). This is a little less than the amount of health the pyro would get for picking up a small medkit. In exchange for being able to heal himself and flank easier, the pyro is discouraged from using the melee in combat and from playing with his team. The damage vulnerability while the weapon is active dissuades the use of the powerjack in fights, as enemies will easily be able to kill the vulnerable pyro while he has the weapon out. The overheal penalty makes the pyro much worse as a medic bodyguard and discourages the pyro from playing with his team, as the medic can only buff the pyro half as much as normally. As always, all feedback is very much appreciated.

You have a much larger hitbox to make it easier for your opponents to time the hit (even though your swords have long reach, you will always be within the opponent's melee range first, no matter what weapon they're using). Regardless of whether you get a kill, you will be able to pull back out using the extra 3 seconds (which give you full turning control) - i.e. to simulate cavalry charge and retreat tactics.

Looking at the weapon, an the discussions I've had on [this post](), the main draw seems to be the ability to operate even more independently of your team and health/ammo packs, rather than the 'no-flinch' attribute itself (which, while the original use of the weapon, was considered overpowered, since it takes away one of the only ways a Sniper can be countered by other classes. With this in mind, and knowing the issues people have with the DDS, I would suggest the following: remove knockback resistance and the 'no-flinch' attribute from the Cozy Camper and replace them with a boost to your max health and your max ammo, as well as improving the health regeneration to be a flat +4 per second while scoped only; as a trade-off however (and since you won't be moving too much once you are in position) you suffer a passive 10% movement speed penalty. =New Stats: ~~**While Scoped: +4 health regenerated per second on wearer**~~ *(Note 1)* ~~**+25 max health on wearer**~~ ~~**+40% max ammo on wearer**~~ *(Note 2)* ~~*10% slower movement speed on wearer*~~ * (Note 1): Health regen has a 1 second delay after scoping and ends instantly upon unscoping.

Rather than increase your health, it will instead make it easier for you to take your shots by removing flinching completely, but will also make all the damage you take while scoped mini-crit as a trade-off. It'll also protect you from explosives by reducing their damage and increasing their knockback, but will leave you more vulnerable to melee attackers as a result (so beware Demoknights). (For a look at what I was originally intending with the DDS and its companion weapons (Sleeper and Bushwacka), please see [this post](URL but also please note that I am probably going to replace it with a more up-to-date version soon.) =New Stats: ~~**While Aiming: No flinching**~~ ~~**40% explosive damage resistance on wearer**~~ ~~*While Aiming: All damage taken mini-crits*~~ *(Notes 1)* ~~*20% increase in push force taken from damage and airblast*~~ ~~*100% melee damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ * (Note 1): This would not reduce crit damage to mini-crits.

In reality, while a powerful weapon, it is balanced by how its projectiles can still be dodged (unlike Sniper Rifle bullets) and its reduced damage cap. It still has the chance to get a random headshot when someone passes in front of an incoming arrow (especially when passing a corner), but this is no worse than explosive spam. There are a few minor changes I'd make to the Huntsman; the only major change would be reducing the base damage to 40 and increasing the charge bonus to +200%, preventing people from getting lethal headshots by firing uncharged shots while still allowing them lethal headshots at full charge. =New Stats: * Damage: 40 * Maximum Charge Damage Bonus: 200% (120 damage) * Attack Interval (Firing Speed/Reload Speed): 2.0 seconds (0.5 seconds/1.5 seconds) * Ammo Capacity: 15 * Movement Penalty while Drawn: -50% ----- **Razorback** =Current Stats: ~~**Blocks a single backstab attempt**~~ The Razorback has had a major problem for a long time. In typical pubs/casual matches, it is an underpowered chunk of wood in a place where one of the other secondaries would be better suited. On the other hand, it is overpowered in Comp (from my understanding) due to the smaller teams and higher average skill levels. This is due to the Razorback's sole attribute: the stopping of backstabs, which forces a Spy to use a revolver to take out the Sniper (which forces him to give up his disguise if he has one as well as leaves him vulnerable to being countered after altering the enemy of his presence). This isn't even getting into the problem of it being designed to specifically counter 1 class, the Spy (the Sniper's primary counter no less). To make it more effective, I would make it repairable as well as have it grant a 40% bullet resistance to the user while charged (still just barely allowing the Sniper to be quick scoped by enemy Snipers). This gives it some pub use and further hampers a Spy's ability to kill the Sniper. However, I would also make the weapon stun mutual: the Spy's knife is disabled for 3 seconds (1 second larger than usual, though it would now force him to his revolver) and the Sniper's ranged weapons (sniper rifles or huntsman) are disabled for 10 seconds (which would force him to his melee weapon). I am also toying with the idea of having a Razorback disable/damage the Sniper's nearby allies and their buildings upon being destroyed, to discourage Sniper's from camping near friendly buildings and allies, though I would like people's opinions on such a stat first. Edit 1: So, i got rid of the backstab immunity. In exchange, the Sniper now resists fire and bullet damage heavily, and will temporarily cripple the Spy's ability to backstab enemies. However, the Sniper himself is far more difficult to heal as a trade-off. =New Stats: ~~**50% fire resistance on wearer**~~ ~~**50% bullet resistance on wearer**~~ ~~**When Backstabbed: Killer cannot backstab for 10 seconds**~~ ~~*Wearer cannot be overhealed*~~ ~~*40% less health from outside sources*~~ * No longer blocks backstabs ----- **Tribalman's Shiv** =Current Stats: ~~**On Hit: Bleed for 6 seconds**~~ ~~*50% damage penalty*~~ The Tribalman's Shiv is often passed over as a useless weapon, outclassed by the other unlocks (especially Jarate). The ability to track Spies, especially with their increased movement speed and assortment of tools, is not a job well performed by the Tribalman's Shiv. Couple that with its reduced damage and the weapon effectively is useless. I would counter this by not only improving the Bleed effect, but also by having the Shiv be used as an emergency weapon of sorts, boosting your movement speed while active at the cost of making you more vulnerable (good for getting into position to start off, good for chasing after enemies like spies, but not as good for escapes. =New Stats: ~~**On Hit: Bleed for 5 seconds**~~ ~~**While Active: 20% faster movement speed on wearer**~~ ~~*While Active: 20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ ~~*40% damage penalty*~~ =Bleed Changes (universal for all Bleed weapons): * Damage per Tick: 2 * Duration: 5 seconds * Debuff on Victim: 20% damage vulnerability (does not stack with itself) * Stacks with itself additively (subsequent hits both refresh the duration and increase the damage done per tick) * Bleeding victims have a constant 'blood droplet' effect, similar to Jarate and Mad Milk, in addition to the periodic blood spurt. ----- Edit 1: Altered the Razorback"

The downside is that you lose your speed boost after some time and can't sustain it during a firefight. The RR allows a Heavy to take ground or retreat between pushes, letting him change positions at a moment's notice. It doesn't increase his speed in such a way that he can run to mid from spawn like the GRU allows.

562,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[Detailed Suggestion] How to Balance All the Pyro Melees Without Nerfing the Powerjack,15,5iwehd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/5iwehd/detailed_suggestion_how_to_balance_all_the_pyro/,2016-12-18 07:23:00,"**(NOTE: X-Post from /r/tf2)** #Prelude Currently, Pyro has three melees that are any good: the Powerjack and, to a lesser extent, the Homewrecker and the Back Scratcher. It's easy to look at Pyro's melee arsenal and think, ""There's no way that X will ever be as good as the Powerjack."" But with one across-the-board change alongside a few follow-up changes, I believe that *all* Pyro melees can be made viable, without nerfing the ones that are currently useful or making a lot of Pyro's melees situationally overpowered or overly annoying. ___ ___ #The Biggest (and Most Important) Change I posit that there is one very important change that must be made for all Pyro melee weapons to be ""viable"" without further nerfing the Powerjack. This is because the Fire Axe, even at TF2's very beginning was a weapon that was only to be used if you were counting on getting a random melee crit or if you were completely out of ammo. The Fire Axe is inherently ""useless"", whereas almost all Pyro's other melee weapons introduced since 2007 *have* a use, and that creates a major problem if you truly wish to balance ""all"" the Pyro melees. In particular, even if you never use it in battle as a finishing weapon (as it was designed for), the Powerjack is an incredibly convenient mobility tool which is at least somewhat useful in any life. That extra mobility is *really important* for the Pyro, and the reason why all the Pyro's other melees are at least partly situational is that they're balanced around the Fire Axe, a weapon inherently situational to the point of uselessness, instead of around the Powerjack, a weapon which is inherently useful. So how can we balance *all* the Pyro melees, without nerfing the Powerjack in a way that makes it as situational as the rest of Pyro's melee weapons and thus nerfing Pyro as a class, like Valve did with the Degreaser changes? &amp;nbsp; Here's my proposal: **By default, Pyro moves +15% faster while melee is active.** &amp;nbsp; You could then balance various weapons around that change. If it is thought to be truly necessary, you could *add some damage vulnerability* by default, too, but I personally don't think that that is important, for reasons that I will touch upon later as I make some suggestions as to how melee weapons could be further rebalanced. But before I do that, let me clarify this major change by explaining why I believe it would work and by addressing some likely early negative reactions. ____ ###Why This Change Would Promote Weapon Balance The Powerjack is the go-to weapon for most Pyros because its upsides are not situational; no matter what playstyle you're using, it can help you at no cost with its very convenient - if relatively small - speed boost. The damage vulnerability is very minor, and only really makes the Powerjack risky to use in *combat*, not for general use in getting to where you need to go a little faster. Compare that to the Neon Annihilator (only useful on maps with lots of water if you can get in melee range of a wet enemy), the Homewrecker (only comes in handy if you're hanging around buildings or happen to be near one when it gets sapped), the Back Scratcher (not worth using if your team has a Medic, unless you're playing roamer), or the Fire Axe (useful if you're completely out of ammo and you don't own the Back Scratcher). The Powerjacks convenient speed boost, in stark contrast, is useful to any Pyro playstyle that involves moving around even a little, and by picking a different melee, you have to give up that convenience for a situational use. Instead of massively buffing each Pyro melee weapon individually by making each of their upsides so useful or so situationally good that players would consider using it over the Powerjack, I believe that the simplest, cleanest solution is changing Pyro as a class so that it has benefits from that convenient melee-only speed boost *by default.* Then Pyro melee would no longer have to be a choice between a convenient weapon and a serious of situationally useful ones, but rather a choice from an array of worthy options. ___ ###Addressing Common Objections This is a relatively big change, so I will try to address any objections raised in the comments. However, I will address several of them in advance. - **It would require the non-standardization of melee.** While it's true that most class's melees have identical stats, Scout's bat is completely different, so there is at least precedent there. - **Too confusing for new players.** Having faster movement speed when your melee is out is a gameplay element already found in Counter Strike, so the mechanic itself wouldnt be too unfamiliar for most newcomers. As for Pyro being the *only* class which benefits from this melee speed boost, Valve could put the movement speed attribute either on the Pyro's melee weapon description (similar to how Valve put a description for the backstab mechanic on the butterfly knife) or in the list of class stats on the loadout screen, and/or add a ""speed"" icon to the HUD when your melee is out. And even if a player doesn't realize at first that they can boost their movement speed as Pyro in this way, it's a small enough difference for newcomers that it shouldn't greatly affect their enjoyment of the game, just like the weapon movement speed variation in CS:GO. - **It would make the Pyro too good.** Any Pyro worth their salt currently uses the Powerjack by default and only occasionally uses other melees. As such, applying that same Powerjack's movement speed buff to Pyro melees *in general* would only buff Pyro as a class in that Pyros could benefit from that melee speed boost without +20% damage vulnerability (assuming that damage vulnerability when active wasn't added to all melees, too). As that's a pretty small downside, it would make for a relatively small buff, one that would be significantly smaller than the Spy's movement speed buff from MyM. No, the true purpose of this across-the-board change is not to meaningfully buff Pyro, but to *improve the variety of viable melee options for Pyros*. ...However, just because Pyro *as a whole* wouldn't change too much doesn't mean that certain *weapons* wouldn't become overpowered by blindly adding a +15% speed boost to every Pyro melee; on the contrary, further tweaks to individual weapons must be made with this overall speed boost in mind. ___ ___ #Individual Weapon Changes Now that I've defended adding a convenient when-active speed buff to all Pyro melee weapons by default - thus putting them all on a level playing field with the Powerjack - I would like to propose further changes to ensure that individual melee weapons are kept relatively evenly balanced. ###The Fire Axe, the Third Degree, and the Powerjack Now that the **Fire Axe** actually has a use, there's no longer an excuse for the **Third Degree** being a direct upgrade. As such, it should have a relatively small, commensurate downside that would be noticeable in regular play, but not annoying enough to discourage its use altogether. I feel like the best downside would be slightly longer deploy or holster speed, because those would mildly affect the convenience of the speed boost. The Third Degree's downside definitely *shouldn't*, however, be longer swing speed (because unlike the Medic's Bonesaw, the Pyro's stock melee still won't be particularly useful as a weapon, so that wouldnt be significant enough a downside) or lower damage (because that would specifically reduce the Third Degree's effectiveness in the one situation in which it differs from the Fire Axe). Overall, the Fire Axe and Third Degree should be kind of like the Rocket Launcher and the Original; effectively identical most of the time, but situationally different. Now, after giving all Pyro melees +15% movement speed when active by default, the **Powerjack** no longer has a ""niche"" of convenient mobility (although calling convenient mobility a ""niche"" in the context of TF2 weapon attributes is somewhat like calling Walt Disney Animation/Pixar movies a niche in the space of great animated movies). Even without the massive advantage previously afforded to it by that attribute, however, the Powerjack still offers a risk/reward system for using it as a ""finishing weapon""; i.e. a weapon used to deal the finishing blow in combat. The Powerjack will differ from the other Pyro melees by having damage vulnerability on the wearer (or simply *more* damage vulnerability on wearer, in the scenario in which Valve gave that particular attribute to Pyro melees by default as well) and restoring health on kill. As such, it's a slightly riskier weapon to use in and around combat compared to the Fire Axe and the Third Degree, but unlike those weapons, it can be worthwhile using the Powerjack to finish off enemies. Exact amounts of damage vulnerability and health gained on kill to properly balance the Powerjack with the Fire Axe/Third Degree can and likely should be tweaked after gathering player data, but I'd start with +20% damage vulnerability and +50 health on kill (and allowing this to overheal again as it once did). &amp;nbsp; **New Fire Axe:** - (+15% move speed on wearer) &amp;nbsp; **New Third Degree:** - (+15% move speed on wearer) - All players connected via Medigun beams are hit - This weapon deploys and holsters 15% slower &amp;nbsp; **New Powerjack:** - (+15% move speed on wearer) - +50 health restored on kill - +20% damage vulnerability on wearer &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ___ ###The Back Scratcher and the Homewrecker Unlike most other Pyro melees, the **Back Scratcher** was actually a relatively useful weapon *without* the convenience of the Powerjack's speed boost. As such, it would be imbalanced to give the Back Scratcher a full +15% speed boost without nerfing some of its other characteristics, so I think that in order to preserve the integrity of the original weapon, it should merely be given a *reduced* speed boost. This boost will serve as a nice little buff to the Back Scratcher overall, but because its a lower speed boost than that of other weapons, the Fire Axe/Third Degree won't completely outclassed by the Back Scratcher whenever there's no Medic, and the extra damage doesn't make the Back Scratcher completely outclass the Powerjack in the niche of finisher weapons. I would start it off with a *+7.5% speed boost* and adjust it as needed. Similarly to the Back Scratcher, the **Homewrecker** was not useless pre-speed boost, either. While I think that giving a speed boost when active will somewhat improve the Homewreckers attribute of dealing extra damage against buildings by making it better-suited for rushing a minisentry, the fact that the Fire Axe still isn't worth using as an actual weapon (as I mentioned before) means that the Homewrecker's small damage penalty isnt reason enough not to use it over Stock. As such, like the Back Scratcher, the Homewrecker should grant a smaller speed boost. I think the Homewrecker is just a bit more situational than the Back Scratcher in everyday Pyro play, however, so I would start it out with a *+10% speed boost*, which is slightly more than that of the Back Scratcher. If necessary, then I could see it getting nerfed later down the line and requiring *two hits* to take out a sapper instead of one for the sake of Spies everywhere. &amp;nbsp; **New Back Scratcher:** - +25% damage bonus - +50% health from packs on wearer (passive) - -75% health from healers on wearer (passive) - -50% speed boost on wearer (i.e. +7.5% move speed on wearer) &amp;nbsp; **New Homewrecker:** - +100% damage vs buildings - Damage removes Sappers - -25% damage vs players - -33% speed boost on wearer (i.e. +10% move speed on wearer) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ___ ###The Neon Annihilator If the **Neon Annihilator** is going to give a +15% speed boost when active, then no random crits and a small damage penalty are not good enough downsides, since - like the Homewrecker - it can remove sappers. The simplest solution would be to remove the sapper removal function altogether, making it basically Stock, but dealing less/more damage on dry/wet players. However, I would go further and have the Neon Annihilator give slightly *extra* movement speed to the wearer while ""wet"" (i.e. having recently touched water) and also let it allow the wearer to swim faster (i.e. suffer less slowdown from moving while underwater). This would enable Pyros to make much more consistent use of water/""wetness"" when using the Neon Annihilator; for example, by retreating faster when covered in Jarate, choosing a route to the objective through which you cross over a puddle to speed yourself up, or sneaking behind enemy lines faster using underwater flank routes on maps like Well, Watergate, and Freight. To me, those would be much more interesting uses for the Neon Annihilator than simply getting free one-shots on anyone who touches water, and it would be far less situational than simply hoping that you get the opportunity to be in melee range of a wet enemy. Now, to compensate for this faster swimming speed, the damage done with the Neon Annihilator's crits should be reduced so that Pyrosharks aren't *too* monstrous; I'd say they should still be able to one-shot Scouts if they can get away with it, but probably not full-health Medics. As such, lets raise the damage penalty against players from -20% (crits deal 156 damage) to -25% (crits deal 144 damage). &amp;nbsp; **New Neon Annihilator:** - (+15% move speed on wearer) - 100% critical hit vs wet players - +5% extra move speed on wearer while wet - -35% move speed reduction on wearer while swimming (passive) - No random critical hits - -25% damage penalty vs players &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ___ ###The Sharpened Volcano Fragment Even with the speed boost, there's no real reason to use the **Sharpened Volcano Fragment (SVF)**. Neither the Fire Axe nor the SVF are worth using in combat over your other weapons in the first place, but at least the Fire Axe can deal a lot more damage with random crits in pubs. The SVFs one upside of setting enemies on fire only really makes sense in Medieval Mode, in which the Pyro only has a melee weapon, because in that mode, it's like, ""Why should the Sniper be able to set people on fire but not the Pyro?"" ...But I digress. Now, I have an interesting idea for the SVF. You could probably just give the SVF minicrits against burning players, reduce the speed boost it gives by 2.5%, and call it ""balanced"", and maybe it would be, but Id like to propose another, much more interesting possibility. We'll start with the SVF giving afterburn on hit, having reduced damage, and dealing minicrits to burning players (for a total of 70 damage per swing, mind you; giving it minicrits against burning players don't suddenly make the SVF a powerful melee weapon). From there, lets make it so that the SVF only boosts movement speed by *+10% by default*. However, for each enemy player suffering from afterburn inflicted by the wearer (including afterburn caused by your flamethrower or flare gun), that boost *goes up by +5%*, so while you have a single enemy on fire, the speed boost given by the SVF becomes equal to the base speed boost of +15%. These ""boost enhancements"" stack, with each enemy currently suffering afterburn inflicted by you adding an extra +5% to the SVF's speed boost, up to a maximum of *+35% move speed* at five players burning. In comparison, Scouts run at 133% base speed, so youll be able to temporarily move a tiny bit faster than a Scout while holding your SVF after setting about half the enemy team on fire. I see this as being a utility tool that encourages a *""disruptive""* playstyle. You can flank the enemy, rush in and set a bunch of people on fire with your flamethrower, and then switch to your melee and run away at Scout speed. Alternatively, you can set several enemies on fire from afar with a flare gun (ideally the Scorch Shot or the Detonator) and use the resulting speed boost enhancement to relocate faster and harass the enemy from a different angle. Setting lots of enemies on fire can be just as helpful to your team as killing an individual enemy or two, and the speed boost afforded by this new SVF allows you to make an escape after lighting up a group or constantly be moving around when harassing large groups from a distance. I don't think that this SVF is overpowered, since it's surprisingly hard to keep 2-3 enemies on fire for more than a couple of seconds at a time while your melee is out, let alone 5, but if it turned out to be a bit annoying, you could always nerf it by appropriately adjusting the numbers involved with its ""boost enhancement"" attribute. The weapon's main drawback is that the quality of the speed boost the provided by the SVF is lower than that of the Fire Axe/Third Degree/Powerjack/Neon Annihilator most of the time, unless you're constantly setting enemies on fire. In particular, the SVF provides only +10% movement speed for actually getting to battle, so it is inherently less useful when there are no enemies around. Overall, I think these changes to the Sharpened Volcano Fragment would make for a weapon with a very interesting niche that serves unique Pyro playstyles. &amp;nbsp; **New Sharpened Volcano Fragment:** - On hit: target is engulfed in flames - 100% minicrits against burning players - -20% damage penalty - By default, only boosts wearer's move speed by +10% when active - Speed boost is increased by additional +5% for every enemy player currently suffering from afterburn inflicted by the wearer, with a maximum speed boost of +35% &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ___ ###The Axtinguisher With the **Axtinguisher**, I think it makes sense for its main downside to be that it offers *no* speed boost while active, since it's historically been the only melee that's properly useful specifically as a weapon. I'll be honest, though; the Axtinguisher is a very controversial weapon, and no matter what stats I suggest, I know I'm going to catch flak for it from a large section of the community. As such, I defer to you readers to suggest balanced stats for the New Axtinguisher that would make it useful for a Pyro yet not overly unpleasant to play against for a *non*-Pyro. *If you have ideas for a ""New Axtinguisher"", please leave the stats in a comment!* &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ___ ___ #Conclusion So, thats how Id rebalance the Pyros melee weapons. But what do you think? Do you think that the core change of applying the movement speed boost to Pyro melee by default is a good one? If so, would you include the Powerjack's damage vulnerability by default as well? Do you agree or disagree with specific weapon changes Ive suggested? What changes would *you* make to make Pyro melees balanced? I look forward to reading your comments! ___ ___ ___ **TL;DR** Summary of my suggested changes: - *Most Important Change: By default, Pyro moves +15% faster while melee is active.* - *Fire Axe* would be go-to melee, with no downsides and a convenient, consistent speed boost - *Third Degree* would be an Original-style alternative to Fire Axe, with a situational upside in exchange for slightly longer deploy and holster times - *Powerjack* would be risk/reward finisher weapon instead of the utility/mobility tool it currently is, having downside of damage vulnerability but giving +50 health on kill - *Back Scratcher* would only give +7.5% speed boost when active instead of full +15% - *Home Wrecker* would only give +10% speed boost when active instead of full +15% - *Neon Annihilator* would no longer remove sappers and wouldnt do enough damage to one-shot full-health, wet Medics, but would offer better mobility to Pyros when wet or underwater, allowing for more dynamic and interesting uses on maps with shallow water and/or underwater sections that don't involve simply hoping that enemies go into the water so you can hit them - *Sharpened Volcano Fragment* would have lower speed boost by default, but that speed boost would increase relative to the number of enemies currently suffering from your afterburn, making for a weapon that encourages a disruptive playstyle in which you focus on pestering lots of enemies with afterburn whilst constantly repositioning yourself "

The Cow Mangler now reloads faster and has unlimited reserve ammo. These two combined make it incredibly powerful in PvP as it has no conventional downsides in damage. The Cow Mangler also features a charged shot that now only requires 2 rockets to achieve the same thing as it previously did. It also benefits from a faster reload speed. The downsides to this weapon include its low damage to buildings. This makes it worse for team play. The weapon has now regained use of random critical hits and crit-charging. A new downside for this weapon include mini-crits being obtained from crits. This means a Kritzkrieg charge or a random crit will only give you mini-crits. Another downside of this weapon is a 20% extra damage resistance for the enemy if they have any relevant damage resist/vuln. For example, a Vaccinator explosive damage Uber will now resistance 95% of your rocket damage, a Darwin's Danger shield will now have 0% vulnerability to explosives, a Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol will have 0% vulnerability to explosives, a Fists of Steel will resist 60% of rocket damage, etc. This also applies to Mark-for-Death from the Fan O'War, Rescue Ranger, Gloves of Running Urgently, or Escape Plan. It doesn't apply to mini-crits from the weapon itself."

Such a fun-looking set, yet it almost completely disappoints. The set seems to imply a slow and powerful Russian meat tank, but the Buffalo Steak Sandvich and Warrior's Spirit are weak and counter productive to their goals most of the time (BSS = melee speed and damage, WS = more damage and finishing for health recovery, both at the cost of vulnerability), while the Brass Beast doesn't have an effective damage boost or resistance boost (anymore at least). (Please keep in mind, while the following stats should work with the current Hibernating Bear weapons, they are made with [my previous Heavy changes](URL in mind). **Brass Beast** =Current Stats: ~~**20% damage bonus**~~ ~~**20% damage resistance when spun up and below 50% health**~~ *(Note 1)* ~~*50% slower spin-up time*~~ ~~*60% slower movement speed when spun up*~~ * (Note 1): [This has actually been tested by Sigsegv, showing that the resistance is applied whenever you take damage that would put you below 50% health, rather than just when you are below 50% health.](URL The Beast is an unappreciated and underpowered weapon. Its bullets are slightly more damaging than the stock minigun's, a difference usually too small to make a difference in any case, while also having a slightly slower spin-up and a significantly slower movement speed. While a bit more true to the minigun's original design (slow and powerful), it easily demonstrates why the Heavy's spin-up penalty and speed penalties were lessened. Despite having an increase in damage, a Heavy (even one on defense, near a dispenser or riding a cart) is incredibly vulnerable and fairly easy to remove from play while spun-up. My changes are meant to change this, making the gun more damaging and dangerous by changing the number of bullets shot instead of the firing speed, as well as slightly reducing the speed penalty and spin-up speed penalty. I'm also replacing the damage resistance with crit resistance while spun up (in honor of the set's original bonus) as well as to prevent the increased chance of landing shots from becoming too strong. =New Stats: ~~**2 more bullets fired with each shot**~~ ~~**60% crit resistance while deployed**~~ ~~**50% larger ammo capacity**~~ ~~*40% longer spin-up time*~~ ~~*50% less healing from outside sources while deployed*~~ ~~*70% movement speed penalty while deployed*~~ *(Note 1)* * All miniguns are unable to load more ammo while spun-up (part of my Heavy tweaks) * All miniguns, as a basis, take a full second after spinning up to reach full accuracy and firing speed. This is affected by any buffs or penalties to the equipped minigun's spin-up speed (part of my Heavy tweaks). * (Note 1): This is reworded to show that it isn't tacking on a new penalty like the current Brass Beast, but instead is changing the minigun's natural penalty to 70%, which is slightly faster than currently (about 23% compared to the current 15%). Currently, the penalty is stacked on top of the natural minigun's speed penalty, which is why the movement speed when revved with the Beast is roughly 15% only, not the 31% some people might think it should be from a quick glance. These changes make the weapon noticeably more effective, giving it a better chance of hitting enemies at mid- and long-range on top of heavily increasing the damage output, at the cost of your movement speed and ability to spin-up in an emergency. You also can tank a headshot when overhealed and spun-up, as well as provide a wall to crits, but will be vulnerable to all other forms of damage (since you can't dodge). The healing penalty (and the minigun-wide penalty to reloading ammo) serve to prevent players from camping Dispensers and carts, forcing them to spin-down now and then to recover, giving enemies a window of opportunity to pierce the defenses if they haven't already done so. Outside of this, the extra ammo allows you to stay in the fight for longer, reducing your need to spin down and hunt for ammo. ----- **Buffalo Steak Sandvich** =Current Stats: ~~Alt-Fire: Share with a friend!

While a wonderful idea for dinner, it is lackluster in actual gameplay (outside of Medieval). The damage vulnerability and restriction to melee relegates it to a rollout secondary with the ability to heal allies if needed. To try and make it more useful in general (as well as make it stand out more from the classic Sandvich), I'd like to refocus it on its set theme: slow and powerful. A lunch that makes you hard to take down without teamwork if you play your cards right. =New Stats: ~~Eat to restore 50% of your max health.

Can be reloaded by picking up a large health kit or visiting resupply lockers) * Cooldown: 30 seconds (Cannot eat again until this timer is finished, even if another BSS is obtained). * Taunt Duration: 3 seconds * (Note 1): This does not act like a health kit. Like my ideas for the other lunchbox items, it only provides health restoration (instant in this case, rather than regeneration over a a few seconds). It does not cure afterburn or bleeding effects; however, it will be able to overheal those who pick it up if possible. With these changes, the BSS can combo with miniguns as well as the Heavy's melees (namely the Beast and the Spirit), allowing you to temporarily buff your maximum health and deal damage at long range, at the cost of also taking increased damage from long-ranged sources. You won't be able to be healed much for the duration, but you'll be able to output a massive amount of damage. Combine it with a minigun and you become practically a lumbering sentry, while combining it with a melee weapon allows you to rip apart your enemies like only a shaved bear can. ----- **Warrior's Spirit** ~~**30% damage bonus**~~ ~~**On Kill: 50 health restored**~~ ~~*30% damage vulnerability*~~ The Warrior's Spirit's major flaw is the damage vulnerability, due to a simple thing: the Heavy is too slow. He has no way of countering the damage vulnerability, meaning he is hurt more by the weapon than he is helped. While another class might be able to use the damage and health-on-kill as a quick finisher to restore a good chunk of health (ala Zatoichi and Powerjack), the Heavy is too slow (and, usually, revved) to take advantage of that (his health is also so high that a small health kit would be more beneficial in all regards). What options do we have for the Spirit though? There are a few ideas, but what do the Heavy's melees already cover? The GRU cover movement speed, the Fists of Steel cover tanking, the Eviction Notice is a proto-GRU, KGB covers damage boosts damage, and the Holiday Punch is a stun weapon. Perhaps something to do with recovery, or countering enemies? Perhaps...the original Equalizer holds the answer? =New Stats: ~~**While Active: Firing speed and movement speed increase as the user becomes injured**~~ *(Note 1)* ~~**While Active: 4 health regenerated per second on wearer**~~ *(Note 2)* ~~*While Active: Blocks healing from all outside sources*~~ *(Note 3)* ~~*While Active: 25% damage vulnerability*~~ * (Note 1): Similar to the original Equalizer/current Escape Plan, the boost to movement speed would cap at 60% when you are at or below 20% of your max health (60 health left). Unlike the original and current Equalizer, the firing speed would receive the same boost at the same rate, also capping at 60%. * (Note 2): The health regeneration would be a flat 4 points per second while active, rather than the shift into adjustable rates that Valve has been favoring as of late. * (Note 3): This will prevent the Heavy from restoring their health with Medics and health kits while active. Only the Spirit's regeneration and your lunchbox effects would be able to restore your health. With these changes, the Spirit now better fits the concepts of both a hibernating bear and a warrior. You start out as your usual slow self, but as you are beaten up you gain melee speed and potential damage. Since this would eventually mean a roughly 120% speed heavy with 'Consecutive Normal Punches' and regeneration that can quickly counter or escape, the Heavy is healed less by Medics at all times. Unlike the Back Scratcher, the Heavy's reliance on outside sources for healing most of the time makes this a major downside, as does the healing blocking while the weapon itself is active. ----- Edit 1: Changed the ""Warrior's Spirit"" passive healing penalty of 50% to a 'While Active' damage vulnerability penalty of 25%."

Oh, how we miss ye! (Or, depending on your main, hate ye, but that's just a matter of opinion.) It used to be regarded as the epitome of ""fun"" in the game, being able to go all-out suicide bomber and take an enemy out instantly, along with yourself if you weren't careful. It was either loved for the wacky antics it could be used for, or hated by targets as a stupid tool that denied a kill that should have been theirs. The true problem with it, you see, was that it only appeased one side while the rest found it annoying to fight back against. Well, I say we need to balance it as both fun for explosive madmen and their targets. Current shit-tier stats: **Ullapool Caber** *Level 2 Stick Bomb* ~~*20% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*This weapon deploys 100% slower*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~*Unlisted: ??% chance to misfire (probably a bug but worth mentioning)*~~ ~~Unlisted: Deals 15% less base damage with an added 75 explosive damage~~ ~~Unlisted: Has a unique taunt that, upon contact with a surface, detonates the weapon~~ Here's where the Caber currently stands. It's complete garbage, and undoubtedly one of the worst weapons in the game. The problem with it is that the last changes made to it did not reduce the overall ability to deal high damage to enemies, but instead just made it extremely difficult to utilize successfully. The bugginess of the weapon didn't help at all, making many Demomen leave this once beloved weapon in the garbage. Suggested stats: **Ullapool Caber** *Level 4 Stick Bomb* ~~Upon contact with the first enemy, this weapon explodes, dealing 145 damage to the target and user, as well as 80 explosive damage to anyone caught in the blast radius~~ ~~Deploy speed changes based on current health, from a minimum of 70% slower deploy speed at 100% health to a maximum of 70% faster deploy speed at 1% health~~ ~~**Explosive recharges 15 seconds after an unsuccessful detonation and 6 seconds after a successful detonation**~~ ~~**Deploy speed penalties are negated while explosive jumping**~~ ~~*Deals 15% less damage after detonation*~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability from fire and syringes*~~ ~~*No random critical hits while the explosive is present*~~ ~~Unlisted: Has a unique taunt that, upon contact with a surface, deals 250 damage to anyone caught in the blast radius, including the user~~ Now THAT'S more like it! With these stats, the pointless damage penalty while the explosive was still equipped has been removed, leaving an overall base of 65 damage for victims unfortunate enough to be the Demoman's initial target. This is more than enough to kill pesky low-health classes like Scouts (who shouldn't be in close range), Spies (who shouldn't be visible), Engineers (who should be hiding behind a Sentry), and of course, Snipers (who IMO should be the ultimate target of Cabers). However, this still leaves enemies with 150 health and higher, particularly Medics (whom I honestly think don't deserve to be oneshot by Demos, but should still be hiding behind another player anyways), with a chance to escape with their lives. The additional damage from fire and syringes should allow both Pyros and Medics to effectively counter any suicide-bombing Demoman charging at them. As for the swing speed penalties, they make the weapon geared more for a last-resort playstyle, in which the user can whip it out in order to take someone with them as they die. The last resort idea appears to have been the original intention, after all, and this would serve that purpose well. Meanwhile, the explosive itself finally gets to recharge after a while, with an even shorter recharge time to reward players who hit their targets properly. Even better, the player can embrace the classic sticky jumping method to get rid of the deploy speed debuffs (if any are present) to quickly whip out their weapon and smack some enemy heads. Additionally, the taunt now does what it should have done the entire time - does an instakill to all classes, barring the Heavy. Let's face it - if you're gullible enough to get hit after hearing ""AHM GON' TA BLAST YA INTA THIN GLEW!!!"", you deserve to die. And hey, the Demo dies too, so it's not exactly one-sided. These changes, I believe, will make the weapon more fun for the user, and less of a hassle for other players, particularly Medics (an unfortunate victim) and Pyros (who as a Demo's hard-counter should be able to fight back effectively)."

People have often asked that the Heavy gain an additional slot for his lunchbox items. Personally, I see this as a foolish idea, as you would now be giving the tank class of the game all of his weapons and an item that can either restore his health/an ally's health or, in the BSS's case, buff his other stats. Rather than do this, I was wondering if it would be possible to make the Lunchbox items multi-slot weapons, meaning you could equip, say, a Sandvich as a primary weapon or a secondary weapon. You'd only be able to have one lunchbox item equipped at a time, but it could actually solve the issue of the Heavy being relatively useless on the front lines in certain situations (as he'd still have a secondary weapon to fall back on if he brought a lunchbox instead of a minigun) without making him too powerful. The same could also be done for things like the Soldier's backpacks or the Scout's drinks. It would allow different combinations of weapons that would allow different playstyles to have some legitimate use in regular play (going back to Scout Heavy, he'd now have an easier time keeping up with the team and would be able to provide allies with intermittent healing, at the cost of his primary source of damage. What do you guys think? ----- **Sandvich** =Current Stats: ~~Consume to regain up to 300 health~~ ~~Alt-Fire: Share with a friend to regenerate their health~~ *Medium health kit* The Sandvich, while not an overpowered weapon, typically outweighs the usefulness of the Heavy's shotguns in many if not most situations. Besides trading the Heavy's shotgun for an SMG and the idea I mentioned above, I'd imagine a decent reworking of the Sandvich would be making it a more restricted recovery-over-time item. =New Stats: ~~Consume to regenerate health~~ ~~Alt-Fire: Share with a friend to regenerate their health~~ * Taunt: 4 seconds * Duration of Effects: 15 seconds * Health Regeneration per Second: 20 (No longer cures debuffs) * Ammo: 2 (Does not naturally recharge. More ammo can be found by picking up medium/large health kits or visiting a resupply locker). * Cooldown: 30 seconds (You cannot consume another lunchbox item for 30 seconds. You can still throw those you have to allies who haven't eaten a lunchbox item recently however.) So, eating the Sandvich before a fight would give you a bit of extra durability in a fight, or could be used after the fight to quickly recover health. Sharing with an ally would also cause them to recover 20 health per second (or, alternatively, restore 6.66% of the consumer's health per second if a flat 20 is proven to be too powerful, which would mean a minimum of 8 health per second on 125 health classes. The health regeneration could also simple be halved to 10 per second). Removing its ability to stop bleeding and extinguish fires removes some of its overwhelming utility, but the health regeneration would still be enough to neutralize either effect the majority of the time. The Sandvich also would not be able to regenerate naturally, and would have to be resupplied at resupply lockers or by medium health kits (1 Sandvich) or large health kits (2 Sandviches). Finally, the cooldown prevents this item from being spammed on self and allies, which would allow player to maintain the hefty health regeneration for an even longer period of time. ----- **Dalokohs Bar** =Current Stats: ~~Consume to gain up to 100 health~~ ~~Alt-Fire: Share with a friend to regenerate their health~~ *Small health kit* ~~**Adds +50 max health for 30 seconds [and can overheal]**~~ The Dalokohs Bar acts as a baby Sandvich, healing only a third of the health with the added bonuses of regenerating quickly and slightly increasing you max health (though not for the purposes of overheal). I've seen it called useless before, and while I don't think this is true (it is particularly useful as a portable mini health kit compared to the Sandvich and Buffalo Steak), but it is lacking in strength. I would actually switch its overheal properties with the speed boost and damage vulnerability of the Buffalo Steak, without the melee restriction. =New Stats: ~~Consume to regenerate health~~ ~~Alt-Fire: Share with a friend to regenerate their health~~ * Taunt: 2 seconds * Duration of Effects: 15 seconds * Health Regeneration per Second: 4 (No longer cures debuffs) * Speed Boost: 35% * Damage Vulnerability: 35% * Ammo: 3 (Does not naturally recharge. More ammo can be found by picking up small/medium/large health kits or visiting a resupply locker). * Cooldown: 15 seconds (You cannot consume another lunchbox item for 30 seconds. You can still throw those you have to allies who haven't eaten a lunchbox item recently however.) The Dalokohs now serves as a small health kit for the Heavy that can be shared with allies, with the added bonus of granting the Heavy an increased movement speed for a time (one that increases his speed with a minigun as well) at the cost of being more vulnerable (effectively having 210 health). It still retains its fast recharging in the way of a faster cooldown and 3 available charges before requiring more ammo, as well as having a faster consumption speed to allow more time to use it. "

Typical referring to illegal dealings, here it refers to one of the Heavy's more premier sets. Consisting of the Tomislav, Family Business and Eviction Notice, it is themed around mafias and mobsters, with gameplay attributes typically pushing for ambushing and speed on the Heavy's part at the theoretical cost of his damage output in prolonged combat. Does this really apply in practice? ...Somewhat? Let's see. (Please keep in mind, while the following stats should work with the current Black Market Business weapons, they are made with [my previous Heavy changes](URL in mind, which include changing the Heavy's minigun warm up, increasing the damage of his fists, and replacing the Shotgun with an SMG). **Tomislav** =Current Stats: ~~**20% faster spin-up time**~~ ~~**20% more accurate**~~ ~~**Silent Killer: No barrel spin sound**~~ ~~*20% slower firing speed*~~ Tomislav is a minigun that spins up somewhat faster a fires a tad slower, with a fairly noticeable boost to accuracy (allowing you to hit more of your shots if you can keep track of your targets,a s well as deal more consistent damage at longer ranges). It's also silent, which make sit easier to catch enemies off-guard. As for an ambushing weapon though...yes, it serves that purpose, but you typically don't ambush people at long range. Typically you would pull a Scout, Spy or Pyro and get close to them, then surprise them with some quick burst damage. The Tomislav instead serves as little more than a slightly weaker minigun with longer range, silence, and a quicker draw. Once it was called overpowered, now it is often called an upgrade to the stock, and others (whom I agree with) call it a boring weapon that doesn't specialize much in any role (like the unlocks are supposed to). This is something I see as a problem. To try and remedy this, I am going to heavily reduce the damage it deals unlike now, by reducing how many bullets it fires per shot. In exchange (and to help improve it's ambushing capabilities), I'm going to boost back up its spin-up speed, as well as make it lighter (reducing the penalty to movement while deployed and increasing the Heavy's jump height while equipped). As the Tomislav is both based off a rather inaccurate gun and is meant more for ambushing, I'm going to also replace its increased accuracy with a slight, passive movement speed boost on the Heavy (this is especially because Natascha is a gun that would better fit as a long range gun, given its description). =New Stats: ~~**40% faster spin-up speed**~~ ~~**10% faster movement speed on wearer**~~ *Passive* ~~**25% greater jump height on wearer**~~ *Passive* ~~**10% movement speed penalty while deployed**~~ *(Note 1)* ~~**Silenced: No barrel spin sound**~~ ~~*2 less bullets fired with each shot*~~ * All miniguns are unable to load more ammo while spun-up (part of my Heavy tweaks) * All miniguns, as a basis, take a full second after spinning up to reach full accuracy and firing speed. This is affected by any buffs or penalties to the equipped minigun's spin-up speed (part of my Heavy tweaks). * (Note 1): This attribute is changing the minigun's natural movement speed penalty to 10%, rather than stacking a 10% movement speed penalty on top of the minigun's natural movement speed penalty, allowing for faster movement speed while revved. With these changes, the Tomislav becomes something akin to a two SMGs welded together. While it still outputs a respectable amount of damage (180 damage a second at mid range, assuming all bullets hit), the reduced bullet count and lack of an accuracy buff make it less reliable than other miniguns at long range (a reverse of before). The major draw of the weapon, now, are its passive upsides: in exchange for the severely weaker minigun, the Heavy is now better able to navigate maps, being almost as fast as a demoman and having a slight boost to his jump that can help him get to unpredictable places. Combine these abilities with the retained silence and you can have a Heavy dropping out of nowhere (as far as the enemy is concerned) with a minigun firing or a Shotgun/SMG filling them with holes. ----- **Family Business** =Current Stats: ~~**33% larger clip size**~~ ~~**15% faster firing speed**~~ ~~*15% damage penalty*~~ The Family Business is in a similar but more severe situation to the Tomislav. It's a slightly faster, slightly weaker shotgun with a slightly larger clip. And... that's it. Beyond it's appearance, there isn't any different playstyle the Family Business helps with. It's just a shotgun that lightly rewards consistent shots with more damage, though it typically is equal to the stock shotgun in regular combat, as it takes about the same time to take out all but other Heavies within 6 shots with either shotgun. Now, if you've read my post on the Heavy's class and stock weapons, you know I want to exchange the Heavy's shotgun for the SMG. In such a case, I would either have the Family Business fire like an SMG, or have it be like the Soldier's Righteous Bison and be the Heavy's only shotgun alternative, with the stats it currently has. In either case, I feel the Family Business needs a boost to its deployment speed at least. If converted into an SMG though, what would be the purpose of the Family Business? The SMG is meant for self-defense when moving from one location to another, as well as consistently putting out bursts of damage at ranges longer than what the miniguns are typically capable of. The redesigned Tomislav retains decently heft damage and allows the Heavy to have greater mobility at all times. So, perhaps have the Family Business capitalize on that? On top of a faster deployment speed, decrease its accuracy, increase its damage and reduce its clip size: =New Stats (Family Business SMG): ~~**40% faster deployment speed**~~ ~~**Builds charge on kills and assists**~~ ~~**Secondary fire when charged grants mini-crits for 8 seconds**~~ *(Note 1)* ~~*60% smaller clip size*~~ ~~*20% smaller ammo reserve*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ * (Note 1): This meter would be called Crackdown. It would take 5 kills or 10 assists with any equipped weapon to fully charge the meter from 0%. The mini-crits would extend to all equipped weapons. Cannot be charged while the meter is activated. This effectively gives the Heavy his own Cleaner's Carbine, though with a smaller clip and ammo reserve instead of a slightly smaller clip and slower firing speed. Rather than building charge through dealing damage, the gun requires either kills or assists with any weapon to build its charge, which can then be used with the minigun or melee weapon if needed, or just used with the Family Business itself to take advantage of its range and accuracy over the minigun (as well as its ability to fire without spinning up). ----- **Eviction Notice** ~~**When Active: 15% faster movement speed**~~ ~~**On Hit: Gain a movement speed boost [40% faster]**~~ ~~**40% faster firing speed**~~ ~~*When Active: 20% damage vulnerability*~~ ~~*60% damage penalty*~~ The Eviction Notice is not a bad weapon, at least not anymore. However, it also doesn't serve any unique role, as it overlaps with the GRU as a speed-boosting weapon primarily meant for reaching the front lines (with the added bonus of making a quick escape). Some would even call it an upgrade, since it lacks the marked-for-death of the GRU and can be used for an escape if you get a quick punch on an enemy. Considering that, and the passive speed boost of the Tomislav, I'll suggest changing the Eviction Notice into something more fitting to its name: in the simplest of terms, a Pain Train for the Heavy, with the addition of Bleed and a damage penalty. =New Stats: ~~**On Hit: Cause your victim to bleed**~~ *(Note 1)* ~~**+1 capture rate on wearer**~~ ~~**20% faster movement speed when carrying an objective**~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ ~~*40% damage penalty*~~ * (Note 1): I would also change how Bleed works, to differentiate it a bit more from Afterburn and give it some use. Specifically, I'd change the duration of Bleed to 5 seconds for all Bleed-inducing weapons (no more 6 second Tribalman's Shiv), reduce the damage to 2 per tick and allow it to stack with itself (so if you hit a bleeding target with the Eviction Notice multiple times, for instance, the bleeding damage they would suffer per tick would increase with every strike on top of refreshing the duration), as well as give victims a 20% damage vulnerability for the duration. With these changes, the weapon now has a unique use on most maps. In exchange for making the Heavy slightly more vulnerable, you gain the ability to cap points and payloads like a Scout as well as move faster if you are carrying an objective in a CTF mission. The bleed effect also fits the model (with spikes like that, it's surprising it doesn't already have such a boost) and (with the damage vulnerability) serves to force an enemy retreat, unless they want to fight in a weakened state. (Typically this wouldn't come up in battle though, since you would normally have your minigun or secondary weapon out instead). "

The reversed damage falloff, meanwhile, punish players for trying to out-range the Heavy and not confronting him at close range, where he would be weakest with this weapon. ----- Edit 1: Changed the description of my change a bit.

576,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,"[IG/OP/UP] ""Tweaking the Classes - Engineer Wrenches"" &lt;Engineer Melees&gt;",1,5ahsju,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/5ahsju/igopup_tweaking_the_classes_engineer_wrenches/,2016-11-01 18:13:16,"So, the Engineer's wrenches. While there are a few differences between them, none of them really shake up the Engineer's playstyle. This is something I find to be a major problem, since wrenches are (next to the buildings themselves) effectively the Engineer's primary weapon. They should have more of an impact on the class itself, rather than only slightly tweaking how the Engineer does his job. I aim to fix this, partially by following the idea of project management (do you want things built fast, built well, or built cheap? You may pick two in exchange for the third). Now, if you saw my [post on the changes to the Engineer as a whole](URL you know that I feel the wrenches should put most of their emphasis on how they change the attributes of the buildings built with them as well as changing the appearance of the buildings constructed. Here, I will be going into three of the four wrench unlocks and offer ways they can do just that (for the Eureka Effect, please see [this post](URL ----- **Southern Hospitality** =Current Stats: ~~**On Hit: Bleed for 5 seconds**~~ ~~*No random crits*~~ ~~*20% fire vulnerability on wearer*~~ *Passive* The Southern Hospitality is effectively an upgrade to the Wrench outside of Pubs (where random crits can make a difference in an emergency with the wrenches), yet sees little use due to its minor buff and its superior alternatives. Going along with my idea of buildings having their stats and appearance changed based off the wrench used to construct them, I would have the Southern Hospitality construct buildings that are cleaner and more detailed than the simple design of the stock buildings (some extra reinforcement on the corners of the buildings, an image worked into the sentry's main body, a few decals here or there, etc). With all that said, I plan on reworking the Southern Hospitality to be a wrench for defensive use, allowing for stronger, cheaper buildings that are harder to move and slower to build, while also retaining the wrench's own self-defense capabilities. =New Stats: ~~**On Hit: Causes your victim to bleed**~~ *(Note 1)* ~~**20% damage bonus**~~ ~~**+50% max building health**~~ ~~**Buildings cost 25% less metal to build, repair and upgrade**~~ ~~*25% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*Buildings have a 50% movement speed penalty when hauled*~~ *(Note 2)* ~~*Buildings construct 50% slower*~~ *(Note 3)* * (Note 1): I would also change how Bleed works, to differentiate it a bit more from Afterburn and give it some use. Specifically, I'd change the duration of Bleed to 5 seconds for all Bleed-inducing weapons (no more 6 second Tribalman's Shiv), reduce the damage to 2 per tick and allow it to stack with itself (so if you hit a bleeding target with the Eviction Notice multiple times, for instance, the bleeding damage they would suffer per tick would increase with every strike on top of refreshing the duration), as well as give victims a 20% damage vulnerability for the duration. * (Note 2): This would replace the standard movement penalty placed on players by hauling buildings, rather than stack with it. * (Note 3): This would add a 0.50 penalty to the construction speed of all Southern Hospitality buildings. With these changes, the Southern is now very useful when a cheap nest is needed but time is not an issue. Buildings are slow to build but are easy to maintain and hard to take out; however, they are difficult to move once built, meaning you have to be careful about where exactly you put them. The Hospitality also retains its (still rarely used) use in spy checking with the altered bleed, which can also be used to weaken enemies attacking your base. And remember the old phrase: Many hands make light work. ----- **Jag** =Current Stats: ~~**Construction hit speed boost increased by 30%**~~ ~~**15% faster firing speed**~~ ~~*20% slower repair rate*~~ ~~*25% damage penalty*~~ ~~*33% damage penalty vs. buildings*~~ The Jag is often considered an upgrade to the Wrench nowadays. With it's faster firing speed almost completely countering the repair penalty, the only major downside is the difficulty in taking down Spy sappers. This leaves the jag a bit too powerful in comparison to its fellow wrenches, which means it should be nerfed slightly (along with buffing the other wrenches). In this case, I am going to be reworking the Jag to better fit along the lines of being fast and cheap, at the cost of quality. Good for offense or a quick defense, but not much else. Jag buildings are going to look more rusted and poorly made than other buildings (chipping paint, rusty metal, dents and nicks, etc). =New Stats: ~~**Construction hit speed boost increased by 50%**~~ ~~**25% faster firing speed**~~ ~~**Buildings cost 50% less metal to build, repair and upgrade**~~ ~~*50% slower repair rate*~~ ~~*-50% max building health*~~ ~~*60% damage penalty*~~ With these changes, the Jag can build and upgrade buildings anywhere on the fly, fast and cheap. However, don't expect to be able to keep them up long; the Jag is pitiful when it comes to repairing damage and removing sappers, and the buildings themselves are far less durable. Luckily, the repairs are cheap too; you just can't rely on them. ----- **Gunslinger** =Current Stats: ~~**+25 max health on wearer**~~ ~~**Sentry build speed increased by 150%**~~ ~~**Third successful punch in a row always crits**~~ ~~*No random crits*~~ ~~Replaces sentry with a mini-sentry~~ The Gunslinger is unique among the wrenches since it is, well, not a wrench. It's the Engineer's hand, after he cut off his old one. Perfectly reasonable decision, honestly. The Gunslinger is currently known for the mini-sentry, as well as for passively increasing the Engineer's maximum health; both of these traits gear the Engineer to be more directly involved with combat, rather than relying on his sentry and teammates: these traits, especially the mini-sentry, are the cause of many people's problems with the Gunslinger. Beyond that, the Gunslinger only has the +25 max health as its benefit. Not particularly useful, since the Engineer still isn't designed for combat. For this rework, I'm removing the mini-sentry from the Gunslinger and making it a building that can be swapped with the regular sentry via the PDA in the loadout menu (could be an unlockable blueprint or some-such, could be part of the stock options). The Gunslinger itself will continue to be more offensively geared, just not for direct combat by the Engineer. Buildings constructed by the Gunslinger will have a more streamlined, almost skeletal appearance (smaller Red/Blue sections, with some exposed circuit-like areas), with orange tubes (similar to the Gunslinger) hanging from or connecting various pieces. =New Stats: ~~**+25 max health on wearer**~~ ~~**Buildings construct 100% faster**~~ *(Note 1)* ~~**Buildings only have a 10% movement speed penalty when hauled**~~ *(Note 2)* ~~**Third successful punch in a row always crits**~~ ~~*-25% max building health*~~ ~~*20% less metal from pickups and dispensers*~~ ~~*Cannot boost building construction speeds*~~ ~~*No random crits*~~ * (Note 1): This adds a 1.00 boost to the construction speed of all Gunslinger buildings. * (Note 2): This goes along with my Engineer changes, which return the Engineer's movement speed while hauling most buildings to 75%, a 25% movement speed penalty. With the current game, this bonus could simply be a removal of the movement penalty while hauling. With these changes the Gunslinger remains well suited for an Engineer on the front lines, or one covering other Engineer's buildings. Buildings constructed by it take half the time to construct, and are easier to move around the map. However, these buildings are slightly weaker than the standard building, while the Engineer himself will have a harder time getting metal for his buildings while one the move. "

578,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[IG] Changes to the Pyro Class (WARNING: VERY LONG),5,5atzrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/5atzrq/ig_changes_to_the_pyro_class_warning_very_long/,2016-11-03 12:32:03,"So, as someone who plays a lot of Pyro, I'm really excited for the upcoming Pyro Update. Maybe you don't agree wit hmy changes, but that's ok. It's normal to have different opinions on certain topics. (Except Casual. That thing should rot in hell.) Also, be aware that I'm not a native englisch speaker, so don't rage about me if I make a typo. Anyway, let's start! **General Changes** ~~**Reflected projectiles now won't mini-crit the player who reflected them**~~ ~~**Reflected projectiles do 30% less damage to the player who reflected them**~~ ~~**Reflected Projectiles have their fuse timer reset**~~ I think I don't have to say a lot about these changes. Pyros use projectiles not only to damage enemys, but also to perform rocket jumps, so a little buff to this would help. ~~**While on fire, players will receive 10% less healing from Medics, Dispensers and Payload Carts**~~ ~~**While on fire, players will recieve 50% less health from healthpacks**~~ ~~**Medics, Dispensers and Payload Carts now have to heal players for 2 seconds to extinquish them**~~ This shouldn't need a big explanation either. Afterburn today is just a bad joke and completely useless. Maybe you could expand on the whole ""Less health while burning"" idea, but I didn't want to make it completely annoying. ~~**Base movement speed of the Pyro is increased to 107%**~~ This change was mentioned a lot when it was announced that a Pyro Update would come. This is because Pyro, the close-range class, has terrible mobility. A small speed buff would help the class. Also, it punishes slower classes to get to close to a Pyro more. **Primary Weapon Changes** ~~**All Primary Flamethrowers are now hitscan and the flame particles better match the actual hitbox**~~ I think I don't need to explain this either. The flamethrower hitboxes are broken and making all Primarys hitscan would fix this. This would also make primary firew and airblasts have the same, consistent range. ~~**Increased general primary DPS from ~153,5 to 170**~~ The flamethrower, Pyro's main weapon, has a horrible damage output and gets outdamaged by the Shotgun, a SECONDARY weapon. I know, people will complain ""But this will make W+M1"" stronger"" and to this statement I have 2 things to say: First, if you get to near to a Pyro, it's your fault and secondly, you could add something like an overheating mechanic to the game (=Holding down M1 will decrease the damage over longer time) **Stock Flamethrowe** ~~Extinguishing teammates now restores 20 ammunition~~ Many people have said that the health bonus you gain from extinguishing is counterproductive because it actually helps the enemy Pyro out by a lot. So, changing the health bonus to a ammo bonus wouldn't destroy the system, but makes it fairer. **Backburner** ~~Extinguishing teammates restores 35 ammo~~ ~~**100% Critical hits when attacking from behind**~~ ~~**+100% compression blast knockback from behind**~~ ~~*Airblasts cost 150% more ammo*~~ ~~*-10% damage penalty*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ So, the higher knockback from behind would be good for flanking Pyro, the playstyle this weapon already supports. The -10% damage penalty results from the general damage increase of Flamethrower so it wouldn't be too OP. **Degreaser** ~~**+50% faster deploy and holster speed**~~ ~~*-20% damage penalty*~~ ~~*Airblasts cost 25% more ammo*~~ ~~*Deals 66% less afterburn damage*~~ The 50% faster deploy and holster may seem like a small nerf at first, because it would normaly deploy 60% faster, but let's be real here. The Degreaser is only used to do combos with you secondary, so the holster speed is more important and those 50% would really help doing combos. The damage penalty, again, comes from the general damage buff, but it's that high because if you want to do combos, you don't need high primary damage. **Phlogistinator** ~~**Upon dealing enough fire damage, secondary fire initiates 'Mmmph', which gives guaranteed Critical hits over a short period of time and heals the player for 100 HP. No damage is taken during the taunt**~~ ~~*Knockback during the taunt will stop the taunt and no healing or critical hits are recieved, but the ""Mmmph"" meter is still full*~~ ~~*No compression blast*~~ ~~*-15% damage penalty*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ With the changes, you gain health again from taunting, but if knocked back during the taunt, you won't gain crits or health, but the ""Mmmph"" meter is still full. This would encurage players to not activate their Mmmph in the middle of the fight, but rather around a corner and suprise the enemy. The damage penalty, again, is because of the general damage buff. **Secondary weapon changes** **Detonator** So I can't write the changes here in stats, but I want the Detonator to have stronger self knockback. Why? Because it would result in higher ""Detonator-Jumps"", the main feature of the weapon in normal use. Right now, it's nearly outclassed by the Scorch Shot, but this small buff would change this. Now, every Flare Gun has it's own style: The Flare Gun = Damage Detonator = Mobility Scorch Shot = Spam Manmelter = Utility And speaking of the Manmelter.. **Manmelter** ~~Alt-fire: extinguishes teammates. Doing so gives 1 guaranteed crit per teammate extinguished~~ ~~Reload: Consume a stored crit for a small speed boost for several seconds~~ ~~Extinguishing teammates now restores 20 hp and 10 primary ammo~~ ~~**Does not require ammo**~~ ~~**+100% projectile speed**~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ Consuming a stored crit for a speed boost would make this weapon way better than it's now. The speed boost could be used for a lot of thing, but mainly, it inproves Pyro's mobility. And now fo the 100% faster projectile speed. The weapon in real has a 50% faster projectile, but in tetsing, I realised that this bonus either doesn't work right or is so minor that the advatage is only noteable when firing at extreme long range and even there, the hit is around 0.5 seconds faster. So short: The 50% faster projectile doesn't do anything. Increasing it would seem reasonable. **MEELE WEAPON CHANGES** **Axtinguisher** ~~**100% critical hits against burning targets**~~ ~~*-20% damage penalty*~~ ~~*-10% slower swing speed penalty*~~ ~~*-50% slower holster speed penalty*~~ ~~*Cannot be switch boosted*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ The Axtinguisher at it's state now is really bad, so tweaking the damage and swing speed penalties would help. Also, changing slower deploy speed to slower holster speed would also help. Before, you needed 10 years to take out your weapon and at this time, the enemy either escaped or the afterburn stoped. But now you can take it out and deal good damage, but are stuck on it and have to put it away slowly, so you're vulnerable to ranged damage. This would make the user think if he should use it now or just stick to his primary because oyu could easily get shot. The ""No switch boost"" stat makes it so that with the Degreaser, you can't take it out in an instane and make the holster speed way less bad. **Homewrecker** ~~**+100% damage bonus against buildings**~~ ~~**Able to damage Sappers**~~ ~~**+50% resistance to knockback while deployed**~~ ~~*-25% damage penalty against players*~~ The Homewrecker is nearly only used to destroy Sappers and hel pyour Engineer, but the original concept, destroying buildings, was completeley forgotten. This is because the building you want to destroy the most is the Senry Gun. The problem is that the sentry knocks you back so you can't damage it. A knockback resistance would help Pyros who want to use the Homewrecker that way. **Powerjack** ~~**On Kill: Restores 50 HP**~~ ~~**Kill Reward may overheal the player**~~ ~~**+10% faster movement speed while active**~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability while active*~~ The Powerjack was used to get to the enemy, kill them, get health and get out fast. But then they nerfed the HP you gain from Kills and the Overheal. After the nerfs, it was only used to be fast. With that buff, the weapon may be used again for its original purpose. Also, I've lowered the speed boost because of the general speed buff the Pyro gained. **Sharpened Volcano Fragment** ~~**On Hit: Target is engulfed in flames**~~ ~~**While deployed: All afterburn damage is recovered as health**~~ ~~*-20% damage penalty*~~ ~~*-20% slower deploy speed*~~ The SVF is useless, we all know that. This buff may make is useable. It makes the weapon focused around setting the enemy on fire to gain health. If you have the weapon out for the entire duration of afterburn, it would result in a total of 60 HP of healing. The deploy speed penalty is made so you switch slower to the weapon. This would make it more usefull if you take out your weapon in advatage to gain as much healing as possible. **Third Degree** ~~**Critical hits all players connected via a medigun beam**~~ ~~*-35% damage penalty*~~ ~~*-25% slower swing speed penalty*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ The Third Degree is the only straight upgrade in the game, and not even good. This change would make it more deadly to Medics, dealing a total of 126 damage to them. If the Medic can't react fast enough and disconnects his beam from the target, he's dead fast. **Final Words** To all who made it this far, thanks for reading the entire post and I hope you like my proposed changes. If you have other ideas, post them in the comments, because I really want to see them. If you disagree with my changes, it's ok. I'm not god or anything and cannot make everybody happy. Have a good day Edit 1: Changed the ""-20% damage"" on the SVF to be a negativ stat; Replaced ""-50% afterburn damage"" on the Degreaser with ""-66% afterburn damage"""
579,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,"[IG] ""The #1 Fan"" and ""The Public Enemy"" &lt;Scout Item Sets&gt;",8,5az20x,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/5az20x/ig_the_1_fan_and_the_public_enemy_scout_item_sets/,2016-11-04 07:06:09,"**Soda Popper** *Level 10 Scattergun* Current Stats: ~~**+50% faster firing speed**~~ ~~**25% faster reload time**~~ ~~**On Hit: Build Hype**~~ ~~*-66% clip size*~~ ~~When Hype is full, Alt-Fire to activate Hype mode for multiple air jumps.~~ ~~This weapon reloads its entire clip at once.~~ The main gripe with the Soda Popper today is that it exceeds the DPS of the Scattergun while still having the benefits of Hype mode, making it a direct upgrade if in the right hands. New Stats: ~~**+50% faster firing speed**~~ ~~**On Hit: Build Hype**~~ ~~*-66% clip size*~~ ~~When Hype is full, Alt-Fire to activate Hype mode for multiple air jumps.~~ ~~This weapon reloads its entire clip at once.~~ Simply removing the faster reload time, making it on par with the Force-a-Nature, reduces the DPS of the Soda Popper to below that of the regular Scattergun. **Winger** *Level 15 Pistol* Current Stats: ~~**+15% damage bonus**~~ ~~**+25% greater jump height while active**~~ ~~*-60% clip size*~~ The Winger is honestly all over the place. It's a shitty pistol with a function that can be replicated pretty well by the Atomizer while not sacrificing a secondary slot. That might be a problem with the Atomizer, but I tried to clean things up a bit and give the weapon a more defined purpose. New Stats: ~~When weapon is active:~~ ~~**+25% greater jump height on wearer**~~ ~~**Wearer never takes fall damage**~~ ~~*-50% clip size*~~ I never understood why the Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol (which I'll be getting to later) had negation to fall damage but the super-jump pistol didn't. This remedies that. The damage bonus was out of place, so it was removed in favor for a small boost to clip size. **Atomizer** *Level 10 Bat* Current Stats: ~~**Grants Triple Jump: The third jump deals 10 damage when used**~~ ~~*-30% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*-20% damage vs players*~~ Pretty much THE best Scout melee. Having an extra air jump for a measly 10 damage taken is HUGE when that extra jump can be used to dodge an 80 damage rocket or 100 damage pipe. And the downsides are negligible; you almost never use your melee as a Scout in a serious environment. New Stats: ~~**+100% air jumps on wearer**~~ ~~*-6 health drained per air jump*~~ ~~*-20% damage vs players*~~ ~~(Hidden: Will no longer let you jump if doing so will cause your death)~~ This still allows you to have your second air jump, but you take 6 damage EVERY TIME you air jump, making you think before you air jump at all. Also, this can be combined with the Soda Popper's Hype Mode for a total of 11 JUMPS (1 regular jump, and 5(200%) = 10 air jumps for 11 total). Add the Winger and the amount of mobility this gives you is absolutely batshit insane. Sure, it takes half your health, but you don't take fall damage and health packs and Medics exist for a reason. Also, you aren't allowed to air jump if it'll kill you because that's stupid. **Baby Face's Blaster** *Level 10 Scattergun* Current Stats: ~~**On Hit: Builds Boost**~~ ~~**Run speed increased with Boost**~~ ~~*-34% clip size*~~ ~~*10% slower move speed on wearer*~~ ~~*Boost reduced on air jumps*~~ ~~*Boost reduced when hit*~~ Kind of interesting how the introduction of one stat made this go from the best scattergun to unarguably the worst. It only takes 25 damage to go from 100% Boost to 0, which is just absurd. New stats: ~~**On Hit: Builds Boost**~~ ~~*-34% clip size*~~ ~~When Boost is full, Alt-Fire to activate Boost mode for increased running speed. Cannot air jump while Boost is active.~~ Now Boost is more like Hype and triggered instead of a passive meter that can go up or down. Also, instead of air jumping just killing your momentum, you can't air jump at all, which means you need to rely on your speed to dodge. You can still air jump when not in Boost, though. **Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol** *Level 10 Pistol* Current stats: ~~When weapon is active:~~ ~~**On Hit: Gain up to +5 health**~~ ~~**Wearer never takes falling damage**~~ ~~*25% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ So, this thing is a mess as well. It doesn't synergize well with the BFB; you take no fall damage, but the most likely scenario for taking fall damage is from an air jump, and air jumping just kind of cripples you with the BFB. Also, its own stats don't even synergize well; you recover health for doing damage...but you take more damage for having it out. New stats: ~~**On Hit: Gain up to +5 health**~~ ~~**+35 health restored on kill**~~ ~~*25% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*30% slower reload speed*~~ Now the weapon explicitly trades firepower for survivability, much like the Black Box. You gain health on hit AND on kill, but you both fire and reload slower. Thanks for reading.

Whereas the current sandman is broken, the current Wrap Assassin is just underwhelming and doesnt fit a role. It allows you to throw a projectile that causes bleed at the cost of the scouts melee. Scouts dont usually use their melees for killing people, hence why utility melees are considered better. This weapon offers an underwhelming upside for a pitiful downside. I recommend reading my sandman post after reading this one to possibly help understanding. ~~**Deal damage to fill Festive Meter**~~ ~~**On full meter: Alt-Fire to launch a festive ornament that shatters causing bleed**~~ ~~**Bleeding enemies suffer +25% bullet damage vulnerability from Secondary weapons**~~ ~~(Hidden) 350 damage required to fill meter~~ Much like my sandman balance changes, this makes it so that the scout does not have the ball as soon as the gates open or the round starts. It makes this weapons upside a reward. My fix for the sandman turns the weapon into a reward that can potentially turn the tide of battle if used on the right person at the right time without being overpowered. This weapon fits a different role though, being more of a combo weapon. Once you hit an enemy not only do they bleed for the usual forty damage but they are also extra vulnerable to secondary options. This makes it easier to pepper down enemies with the pistol or even do a bit extra damage with the initial hit from a cleaver. Im honestly unsure of the damage vulnerability to secondary attacks so leave your opinion on the matter. The damage required to fill the meter is also debatable. ~~**Ornament recharges if it does not hit a target**~~ ~~**+25% increase in recharge rate**~~ This is to make the weapon more forgiving to use. You wont have to deal all the damage back if you miss. It would make the cycle of using the weapon go like this: Deal damage. Throw. Miss? Wait a 15 second recharge. Throw. Hit. Repeat. ~~(Hidden) increased shatter range~~ ~~(Hidden) splash damage from shatter causes half the bleeding of a direct hit~~ These make it easier to land hits with the ball and was just a fun little way to make the weapon a little stronger. ~~*-75% damage penalty*~~ ~~*-5 health on wearer*~~ I added a very small health penalty because this weapon is kind of an alternate to the sandman I made. You could either chose to lessen the reliability of an opponent with the sandman or pack more of a punch with the Wrap Assassin. The damage penalty was increased to balance things out a bit more. Thank you for reading and please comment your opinions. Have a wonderful day :) [EDIT] Made a few changes to the weapon. -ThatFeelin (On YT)"

The rifle has often been considered underpowered, while the shield and machete are often considered aggravating or overpowered. So, what can be done to fix this? What is this set meant for? Looking at it, it seems like it's geared for survival closer to the front lines at the cost of your headshot kills, as well as making it easier to kill lighter classes while making it harder to kill heavier classes. So, perhaps more focus on that. ----- **Sydney Sleeper** =Current Stats: ~~**+25% charge rate**~~ ~~**On Scoped Hit: Jarate target for 2 to 8 seconds based on the amount charged**~~ ~~**Headshots and fully charged shots cause an explosion of Jarate**~~ ~~*No headshots*~~ ~~*No random crits*~~ The bodyshot rifle, as it's also called, is a decent weapon (especially with the inane jarate explosion and the extinguishing of allies), able to weaken enemies for your team to take out as well as charge somewhat faster. You effectively give up most of your damage potential to weaken enemies for your allies, or otherwise take out light classes quickly (up to a Medic). It can be considered more reliable than the other rifles as well, as its main power comes from easier bodyshots, rather than quickscopes that have a decent chance of missing even among skilled players/charged headshots that can take out any class. To strengthen this rifle, I would make the 'Headshot immunity' feature exclusive to this rifle, not the DDS. You can't deal headshots and, in turn, you can survive them as well. I'd also make it a bit more stealthy and unique, as it still requires waiting in one spot for a fairly long period to gain it's bonus. However, I would remove the jarate explosion and extinguishing effects it has recently gained (as Sniper is meant to be focused on individual classes, and there are already enough ways to extinguish afterburn). =New Stats: ~~**On Hit: Jarate target for 2 to 8 seconds based on the amount charged**~~ *(Note 1)* ~~**While Scoped: 60% bullet damage resistance**~~ *(Note 2)* ~~**Stealth Killer: No sniper dot or kill sound**~~ *(Note 3)* ~~**+25% shorter charge time**~~ ~~**Crits when it would mini-crit**~~ ~~*40% damage penalty*~~ ~~*No crits on headshot*~~ * (Note 1): This means that unscoped shots will coat targets in jarate for 2 seconds as well. * (Note 2): This would reduce the damage taken from sniper rifles to 20 damage while scoped, which also reduces the damage taken from headshots to 120 points. * (Note 3): Enemies killed by this weapon will either collapse silently or have the 'Headshot' animation silently when killed by this weapon. The sniper rifle dot present on other rifles also will not appear while this rifle is scoped, allowing you to not alert enemies while aiming at targets. A lot of changes, I know. First, the bullet resistance while scoped: this would allow for the Sydney Sleeper to retain the set's original purpose (headshot survival) without forcing the enemy to also use the same weapon. The Sleeper only grants the resistance to bullets while scoped, where you would also be trying to bodyshot. You give up your headshots, and can't be headshot in turn. The decreased damage, as well as the no-scope jarate on hit and the crits to mini-crits are to allow the weapon a more reliable, but not overpowered, use on the front lines (either for 1v1 combat or supporting allies). With this, the Sniper would be able to deal 210 damage with 3 consecutive no-scope shots (raised to 270 if you open up with a fully charged scope shot), allowing you to quickly take out even soldiers fairly quickly if you are good at firing from the hip, despite lacking the burst damage of the Sniper Rifle. (This isn't even considering combining this weapon with the Cleaner's Carbine or Jarate). Of course, you still don't get headshots, but that's something you can more easily work around now, if you're skilled. Finally, the stealth attributes. All the rifles, even the Hitman's, shine a laser dot on whatever surface they are aiming at while zoomed in; the only exception in the Huntsman, a bow. Given the Sleeper's weaker shot (and the concept of being a poacher's weapon), the lack of a dot and kill sounds means that it will be easier to take out enemies before they realize where you are. As also mentioned, the Sleeper's shots would no longer explode on headshots or at full charge, nor would it extinguish allies. Now, there are a couple other ideas I'd like to discuss that I thought might fit on the weapon, but did not put on (too many stats and all that). I'll just list them below: * Replace the jarate effect with a unique 'Weakened' effect, which would have a HUD icon and reduce either the victim's firing speed and reload speed or their damage dealt along with a damage vulnerability. The 'crits when it would mini-crit' could be replaced with 'crits on Weakened targets' or 'crits on debuffed targets'. * A faster reload speed, allowing for more shots (possibly include an increased charge rate/reduced charge time) ----- **Darwin's Danger Shield** =Current Stats: ~~**+25 max health**~~ ~~**15% bullet damage resistance on wearer**~~ ~~*30% explosive vulnerability on wearer*~~ The Danger Shield is not an overpowered weapon, but is often considered an unfair weapon in competitive matches due to the advantage it gives in Sniper vs. Sniper duels. Many suggestions involving manipulating how much overheal you can have, or how fast it decays, or some other sort of downside has been made to make up for this. I simply say scrap the bullet resistance of this weapon and place it on the Sleeper (as explained above), and rework the purpose of this weapon. Speaking of such, what is the purpose of this weapon? As it is part of the Croc-set, I'd say it's always been about survival, trading self-defense (via the SMG) for durability. So, since a scoped Sleeper can handle bullet resistance, why not focus on the other two types of damage? As for a downside...perhaps more vulnerability while scoped, and more vulnerability to melee weapons? =New Stats: ~~**+25 max health**~~ ~~**40% fire damage resistance on wearer**~~ ~~**40% explosive damage resistance on wearer**~~ ~~*While Charging: All damage taken mini-crits*~~ *(Notes 1)* ~~*100% melee damage vulnerability*~~ * (Note 1): This would not reduce crit damage to mini-crits. It would only raise all basic damage taken to mini-crit levels while scoped. This would also apply to the Huntsman. With these changes, moving through the map is a fair deal easier, as you are more resistant to Pyros, Demomen and Soldiers (as well as to damage in general, due to your boosted health and potential overheal) as long as you keep moving, but are weaker when you are actually scoped in. In addition, you are still two shot by melee weapons unless you are being actively overhealed; even then, it's unlikely you'd survive two seconds with any other class's melee weapon. ----- **Bushwacka** =Current Stats: ~~**Crits when it would mini-crit**~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~*While Active: 20% damage vulnerability*~~ The Bushwacka, on its own, is a good sidegrade to the Kukri. No random crits, and you are more susceptible to damage while it's active, but you can also take advantage of enemies vulnerable to mini-crits to take them out. However, this balance becomes overpowered when mixed with two of the Sniper's secondaries: Jarate and the Cleaner's Carbine. Both grant the Sniper guaranteed mini-crits, allowing the Sniper to be come a crit machine for a couple seconds; each strike dealing 195 damage. Within four strikes every class, even a fully overhealed Heavy, will fall to this weapon. Not only is this a bit overpowered, but it also doesn't balance well with the rest of the set, which trades damage and self-defense for durability or team support. The Bushwacka should continue this trend; for this, I would suggest it increase the Sniper's movement speed while active, allowing it to be used as an escape tool, or a method of keeping distance in a melee fight (besides that, I already gave the 'crits when it would mini-crit' attribute to the Sleeper, where it seems more fitting); this would take advantage of the DDS's increased durability, as well as allow for easier positioning/escaping with the Sleeper and other rifles. =New Stats: ~~**While Active: 20% faster movement speed**~~ ~~**20% damage bonus**~~ ~~*While Active: 20% damage vulnerability*~~"

Often has the suggestion been made to combine the two of them, and often has this suggestion been shot down. I myself see it as a potential solution that should be considered, but not actually necessary. However, both weapons do need to be looked at regardless. I'd like to go into that here. First though, I'd like to list a few changes I made in [a previous post on the Soldier](URL which would combine nicely with these changes: * Soldier and Demoman no longer have any natural self-damage resistance * Rockets no longer have damage falloff or damage ramp-up * Rockets deal 80 damage instead of 90 * (Potentially): The Soldier's movement speed is increased to 90%, but his Rocket Launchers impose a hidden 11% movement speed penalty while active, reducing his movement speed to 80%. Anyways, consider or ignore the above when looking over the stats (everyone always does), and let me know what you think: ----- **Gunboats** =Current Stats: ~~**-60% blast damage from rocket jumps**~~ The Gunboats are a simple weapon. Replace your shotgun for reduced damage from your rocket jumps, reducing your mobility. However, while this seems to be a balanced option in Comp, it's more often than not an overpowered one in pubs, as giving up the backup firepower of the Shotgun is far outweighed by the combined mobility and firepower allowed by the Gunboats. You no longer are as reliant on a Medic, and you will typically have both a durability and height advantage over any enemies you run across. Since mobility and durability are usually granted at the cost of one another, I would say we should take have the Soldier trade some of his durability for his potential mobility, to balance it out to be true side-grade to the Shotgun. =New Stats: ~~**-75% explosive self-damage on wearer**~~ *(Note 1)* ~~*-25 max health on wearer*~~ * (Note 1): This would reduce the damage you take from rockets at close range at all times, not just on rocket jumps. Would allow you more safety to use the rocket launcher in close quarters, as well as no longer have to worry about your resistance being ignored because you happened to clip an invisible spy or an enemy who was too close. These changes would reduce the Soldier's health to that of a Demoman or Pyro, reducing the health he'd receive from health packs as well as reduce his potential overheal, on top of making him slightly easier to kill. In exchange for this however, the Gunboat's original 75% rocket jump resistance has been returned and improved, now reducing all self-damage taken from your rockets and the Equalizer/Escape Plan taunt, not just the damage that doesn't affect an enemy. ----- **Mantreads** =Current Stats: ~~**-75% reduction in push force taken from damage**~~ ~~**Deal 3x falling damage to the player you land on**~~ The Mantreads are often considered a gimmicky downgrade to the shotgun, as the knockback resistance does not affect airblasts while the stomp is both hard to pull off and rarely effective. If not combined with the Gunboats or turned into a reskin of that weapon, I would suggest the Mantreads being made into the polar opposite of the Gunboats, meant to help the the following changes to the stats: =New Stats: ~~**-75% reduction in push force taken from all sources**~~ *(Note 1)* ~~**+50 max health on wearer**~~ * (Note 1): Like a glitch originally caused, this would also reduce how far your own rocket jumps would be able to send you. Now, the Mantreads are now both useful and very different, compared to the Gunboats, without being too powerful compared to the Shotgun. With 75% resistance to all sources of knockback, it will be harder for Pyros, sentries, crits, and all other knockback sources to push back or juggle the Soldier. On top of that, your health has been increased, granting you more health from health packs as well as granting you an overheal of 375. However, your rocket jumps are almost nonexistent, limiting your potential mobility to only slightly above that of a Heavy. ----- =OPTIONS B and C: Make the Mantreads a reskin of the Gunboats. Either combine their stats, move the Mantreads stats onto a new weapon, or move the knockback resistance onto the Battalion's Backup (can give an additional bonus to the Buff Banner to keep them equal). =Stats if Combined: ~~**-50% explosive self-damage on wearer**~~ ~~**While Grounded: 50% knockback resistance from all sources on wearer**~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ This combination would increase your mobility and make it harder for enemies to stop/juggle you, but would also make you more vulnerable to damage in general. However, unlike the changes above, it wouldn't affect how much overheal you can receive or how much health you can restore via health packs. ----- As a final note, though I would get rid of the stomp from the Mantreads, if people really want it in-game, I would suggest just making it a universal stat of the Soldier's boots (hell, maybe add the Demoman's boots too). It's a gimmicky stat that doesn't rarely affects any match regardless, so it should be fine making it universal to all the boots."

These hidden stats will also make the shatter effect more useful since the current shatter effect is basically pointless and useless as youll never get a kill or have any major effect on players with the shatter effect. It can now inflict bleed onto other players even if you dont hit them which can also apply the crit effect onto them while increasing the radius you can bleed other targets from small to medium so its easier to damage a large group of enemies from a distance who are on a control point or a payload cart, however a normal damaging shatter effect is only 4-5 damage but a crit will deal around 12-15 damage which isnt that big, but definitely an improvement since it can also bleed other players in the radius. --- If there are any suggestions for changes to these stats that seem to be OP or UP, let me know in the comments below and I will consider changing some of them if I think they are good enough. EDIT: I've added ""20% damage vulnerability while active"" so it doesn't seem like a direct upgrade to stock since you aren't going to be dealing damage with your melee all the time."

I did work hard on these changes though, so feedback would be nice. Primary and Secondary changes will be up soon, but I don't want to overload you guys (or myself) ;P First up, some refreshers from the last two threads before we move ----------------- **Afterburn Changes** ~~**Afterburn now completely ignores all non-fire damage reduction**~~ ~~Afterburn now comes in three degrees of intensity. Each degree lasts 5 seconds by default~~ ~~Lower degrees will always follow higher degrees (i.e. second degree ends, first degree immediately begins)~~ ~~Grabbing health packs will only cause the present afterburn degree to end immediately. Does not stop the health pack from healing~~ ~~Being healed by medics/dispensers will cut the degrees timer in half (More or less what it does now, but by each degree instead of all at once)~~ ~~If already on fire, getting hit by a lower degree burn will not cancel out the higher degrees (i.e. if presently under second degree burn, getting hit by a first degree burn applying weapon will not downgrade the second degree burn)~~ ~~However, higher degree burns will trigger~~ ~~First degree:~~ &gt; * *3 damage per 0.5 seconds (Total: 30 damage)* &gt; * *All incoming damage on victim increased by 5%* &gt; * *All incoming healing on victim reduced by 15%* ~~Second degree:~~ &gt; * *4 damage per 0.5 seconds (Total: 70 damage)* &gt; * *All incoming damage on victim increased by 10%* &gt; * *All incoming healing on victim reduced by 30%* ~~Third degree~~ &gt; * *5 damage per 0.5 seconds (Total: 120 damage)* &gt; * *All incoming damage on victim increased by 15%* &gt; * *All incoming healing on victim reduced by 45%* ------------------ **Base Pyro Changes** ~~**All self-damage resistance increased to 35%**~~ ~~**All debuffs placed on Pyro will have their duration decreased by 50%**~~ ~~**If any enemy with a buff hits Pyro, the buff's power will be decreased by 75%**~~ ~~**Incoming knockback resistance on Pyro increased by 35%**~~ ------------------ **Base Fire Axe Changes** ~~**General deploy time decreased by 30%**~~ ~~**Base damage increased from 65 to 80**~~ ~~**Base swing interval decreased from 0.8 to 0.55**~~ ~~**On hit: Creates a gash on the enemy for 20 seconds**~~ &gt; * *Gash will be cured when grabbing a health pack, but in turn will not restore any health* &gt; * *Gash cannot be cured by Medics or Dispensers (they will still heal normally)* ------------------ ------------------ **Axtinguisher** *Specialty: Burst/Finisher* *Downfall: Debuffing/Combos* ~~**100% chance to crit against burning players (132 damage)**~~ ~~*-75% gash duration (5 seconds)*~~ ~~*A successful hit will dispel all debuffs from the enemy*~~ ~~*-45% damage penalty (44 damage)*~~ ~~*80% slower swing speed (0.99 seconds)*~~ ~~*+75% holster time*~~ So the Axtinguisher is supposed to do a lot of burst damage, so that is what it does. The longer deploy time is replaced with a longer holster time, because that stat is directly counterintuitive to the Axtinguisher's use, so there's that. It also gives the Pyro a decision on whether to do a burst to kill say a Medic really quick but be highly vulnerable for much longer than if he had the regular Fire Axe. But to keep it from not being a direct upgrade to the improved Fire Axe, it has a lot of downsides mostly involving using it for more than one swing. Also, the dispelling is to further make sure the Axtinguisher doesn't outshine it's stock counterpart. Hopefully this isn't too many downsides, cause the upside of killing light classes instantly should be more than enough reason to use this weapon. Lastly the gash duration is not completely removed so if you axe some heavier classes, they won't simply brush off your assault immediately after. It also can help with killing people who are close to getting a medpack. :D **Homewrecker** *Specialty: Supporting/Sentry Dodging* *Downfall: Power/Fighting/Debuffing* ~~While active: Enemy sentries will ignore you for up to 8 seconds. Ends prematurely if you hit a sentry~~ ~~**-50% sentry knock back while active**~~ ~~*-60% damage to players (32 damage)*~~ ~~*Does not create gash on hit*~~ A really powerful option that Pyro doesn't yet have, this weapon alone can give Pyro a huge advantage in offense. So huge in fact, that I needed to remove the gash effect completely, and remove the increased damage to buildings. However, I still wanted a bit of sentry bashing capability, so now the Pyro takes less knockback, allowing a frontal assault on a sentry, something the old Homewrecker lacked anyway. It deals piddly damage however, but considering how melee is balanced, that shouldn't be too much of a problem. Out of all my changes, this is the weapon I'm most afraid will become a straight upgrade to stock, something I want to avoid, so please tell me if you guys feel the same. **Powerjack** *Specialty: Mobility* *Downfall: Fighting/Vulnerability/Defense* ~~**While active: +15% move speed**~~ ~~*While active: Any damage taken will prevent the user from switching weapons while also slowing them by 80% for 0.75 seconds*~~ ~~*While active: 25% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ ~~*-15% damage (68 damage)*~~ ~~*Does not create gash on hit*~~ Like the Axtiguisher, many downsides for one upside is what we have for our overused car jack weapon today. Not only does it not heal on kill anymore, nor do the gash effect I added, but it will be the death of you should you simply try to escape. And if someone sneaks up on you, you will be defenseless as you can only stare them down until they kill you because of the fact that you'll be more or less stunned while holding it. Basically, this weapon has turned into a way to get into position, not to fly across the battlefield. Hopefully this promotes wise use of the movespeed. **Back Scratcher** *Specialty: Power/Flanking* *Downfall: Teamplay/Holding Positions* ~~**+15% damage (92 damage)**~~ ~~**+60% health given from health packs**~~ ~~*-75% health given from Medics and Dispensers*~~ Not much change since this is the weapon most balanced with the stock as it is. Some small number changes to accomodate for the Fire Axe changes of course. **Sharpened Volcano Fragment** *Specialty: Debuffing* *Downfall: Power* ~~Afterburn: Third degree~~ ~~**On hit: Causes afterburn**~~ ~~*-35% damage (52 damage)*~~ ~~*+60% swing speed (0.88 seconds)*~~ A clever way to buff this joke of a weapon, it now deals the devastating third degree burn to enemies, as well as still doing the gash effect. This will truly cripple anyone it hits for quite a while, as they will take 15% extra damage and 45% less healing. Plus, the 120 damage should they not get a healing source. I don't think I need to explain much further than this. ;) **Third Degree** *Specialty: Dispel Buffs* *Downfall: General Use/Combos* ~~**All enemies connected by Mediguns or team buffs will be hit by minicrits**~~ ~~**On Hit: All buffs on all enemies hit will be removed (Will work on Ubercharges)**~~ ~~*Will break after three swings (Can regain weapon by resupply or dying)*~~ ~~*+85% deploy time*~~ ~~*+40% holster time*~~ However, I might need to explain this. Your eyes likely stuck onto the ""works on Ubercharges"" in the description. Well remember that a watchful Medic can see a Pyro about to attack his patient with the Third Degree, especially when you take into account the abysmal deploy time. This should give a lot of leniency for Medics to simply stop healing the enemy Pyro's target. Not only that, but since the Pyro has a limited amount of uses, he can't afford to miss the Medic Ubering, so this will encourage flanking and attacking when the time is right. As for the other stuff, like the minicrits on connected targets and those connected targets also including team buffs like the Soldier's backpacks, that is mostly there to both reward Pyros for using this situational weapon well, and giving more situations where they can. **Neon Annihilator** *Specialty: Assurance* *Downfall: Fighting* ~~**-40% swing speed (0.33 seconds)**~~ ~~*-50% damage (40 damage)*~~ ~~*While active: 25% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ ~~*Does not create gash on hit*~~ ~~On Hit: Electrocute enemy for 20 seconds~~ &gt; * ~~If the enemy has any afterburn on them removed prematurely, ""electrocution"" debuff will end and the following will occur:~~ &gt; * *Enemy will have their location revealed for 10 seconds* &gt; * *Enemy will bleed for 10 seconds* &gt; * *-50% bleed damage (40 total)* &gt; * *Enemy will be unable to reload weapons for 10 seconds (this includes clipless weapons that need to reload like Sniper Rifle, Flare Gun, etc.)* &gt; * *Medics and Dispensers will shorten the duration of the activated electrocution* I wanted at least one weapon where I traded the gash effect for something totally different, and what better candidate than the strange Chinese sign weapon. The idea of electrocution is to give teammates an idea of where to finish off targets that might just escape your grasp or kill you (which is easier while using this weapon) as well as to punish any and all ways that the game gives to shorten your afterburn. The lack of reloading can create some desperation and downtime on the enemy's part so they become even more vulnerable to ally attack. That's what I wanted this weapon to mostly turn into: a way to further punish your enemy using there resources simply to get rid of your afterburn, and considering how strong I made afterburn, this should now be a worthy pickup. I also made it swing faster to be able to electrocute as many people as possible, for obvious reasons. ------------------- So yay or nay? Hopefully it isn't too awful. :/"

Reducing the max health of the Scout could be an even trade for the mobility boost on his already incredible mobility. You have the ability to literally dance around the enemy and deal damage without taking any/very much while under Hype. Lowered health would mean that the Scout using this weapon would need to completely out-think whoever they face off rather than just rely on the mobility boost. Just about any damage could either kill them or hurt them so critically they are forced to retreat immediately. Having incredible mobility for less health seems like a logical thing to me. --- **Crit-a-Cola** ~~While Under the Effects: +25% movement speed, your attacks mini-crit, you are marked for death for the duration of the effects.~~ ~~User is marked for death for 2 seconds after effects have worn off.~~ I'm pretty sure this was what the original request of the community was (Minus the 2 seconds after) Keeping the 2 second mark after seems like a neat thing to do as well. --- **Sandman** ~~**Alt Fire: Launches ball that marks opponent for death**~~ ~~*50% Slower Swing Speed*~~ OR ~~*15% slower weapon deploy and holster*~~ ~~{Hidden} The distance the ball travels determines the length of time the target is marked for death.

(I'm lookin at you Soldier &amp; Demo mains) It was found that in a 1v1 scenario the Engineer could easily shutdown a projectile class with the Alt Fire if they were proficient enough with the Short Circuit. My thought is to make the Engineer think more about metal consumption and only use it as a defensive weapon rather than run in and just spam willy nilly to shutout projectiles. I also added no metal from dispensers as a measure to prevent sitting on one and just spamming projectiles away. The increase in distance for the primary fire is to show it a little love and make it less useless, it's basically useless at the moment. Seriously who uses the primary fire of the Short Circuit over the Primary Weapon? --- **Southern Hospitality** (Note: Not Actually Banned) ~~**On Hit: Bleed for 5 seconds**~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~*20% Damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ This thing is basically a straight upgrade in competitive.

The upsides aren't enough and the downsides are too much. My suggested changes are to change the damage vulnerability while active to a damage vulnerability while double jumping. The reason for the damage vulnerability is to compensate for the no falling damage upside, but it just sort of ruins the weapon since it always applies while the weapon is out, so just make it so that it only applies when someone is using it for that stat, and that downside will be fine with the upside. Next, the 25% slower firing speed is a huge downside on a pistol, but only +5 health per hit really does not make much difference at all, despite Scout not having much health. I suggest making so that it can heal up to +15 health on hit depending on the damage dealt, and since it is a pistol the damage dealt depends on range from the target. So if you are daring and closer to an enemy, the more health you will get for that, and you will always get a minimum of +5 health even when you are at the longest range. I think that this would balance out the weapon fairly well without making it too good. Let me know what you think below, and any recommendation or constructive criticism is welcome. ~~Changes from its current form:~~ -Changed -20% damage vulnerability while active to -20% damage vulnerability while double jumping -Increased health gained on hit from +5 to up to +15.

So long as one stays of the frontlines while it's active, it's practically irrelevant. It's for this reason that I suggest that, along with the markee taking minicrits, they also be given a team-coloured glow while it's active, similar to the intel in ctf, or the glow which all teammates have upon spawning. Essentially, not only do you take more damage, but all of the enemy team knows where you are and that you're weak. The knock on effects for this are huge, as the Marked For Death mechanic is used by a number of problematic weapons. Firstly, it's a significant but non-crippling nerf to the Gloves of Running Urgently. In pubs, where the GRU isn't too overwhelming a factor, it doesn't matter so much, but in any competitive format it's a huge balancing factor. Yes, you can use the GRU to speed up your heavy's rollout, but in doing so you give up any element of surprise, which is a major tactical advantage. If the enemy team communicates effectively, they can concentrate firepower and take down the heavy very quickly, because they know exactly where he will be. Secondly, it's a nerf to the Crit-A-Cola. This one's not as game-changing, but it means that Scouts using it must be much more careful in their getaways, as they can't hide during their period of vulnerability. Thirdly, it's a major buff to the Fan-O-War. Hitting an important target, such as an enemy medic or heavy, now makes them a beacon for the incoming firepower of your entire team, and they can run but they can't hide. Still, in most situations it will be better to take a meatshot, but this would give the FoW a use-case in spam-fests where one can't hang around for a second hit. To conclude, I think this is an interesting idea because it's a soft power. It doesn't just deal straight-up more damage, instead it offers a weakness for the enemy team to exploit with good gamesense and tactical play. In addition, it helps balance several broken weapons in an interesting manner. Please, share your thoughts!"

I and a lot of others thought that the bonus charge duration that it previously had was fine, but it seems like through the change the TF Team tried to make it a cross between the Half Zatoichi and the Eyelander without any major downside, but it just did not work out. I have 2 ideas for how this weapon can be balanced. The first is to add back the bonus charge duration stat, but to compensate for this the damage vulnerability is increased from 15% to 25% and it has a new unique downside of it deploying and holstering 25% slower than all of the other sword weapons to also compensate for the longer charge. If the idea of a longer charge duration on a swords is too overpowered though, the other idea of balancing it that I has was to make it more of a cross between the Half Zatoichi and Eyelander. I would increase the health gained on kill from +25 to +50 to make it better than the Eyelander for the health gained, but not as much as the Half Zatoichi. To compensate, the damage vulnerability would be increased from 15% to 20%. Overall I think that either of these balances would balance out the weapon fairly well. All feedback and constructive criticism is welcome. ~~Changes from its current form:~~ -Added stat: +50% longer charge duration -Increased damage vulnerability while deployed from 15% to 25% -Added downside: This weapon deploys and holsters 25% slower than all other swords Or -Increased health gained on kill from +25 to +50 -Increased damage vulnerability from 15% to 20%"

Firstly, it is banned in many Competitive Leagues do to it making Heavy too fast with its movement speed bonus, and the other issue is that it just isn't good enough otherwise. My suggested changes are to reduce the movement speed bonus from +35% to +15% so it is not overpowered in that aspect. Next, I would completely remove the 25% damage vulnerability while under the effects to compensate and because that just should not exist at all if it is forcing the Heavy to use his melee weapons to kill enemies. I would actually add a 20% resistance from all ranged sources stat while under the effects to compensate for the movement speed bonus decrease and to make it so that the Heavy has a chance at getting close to enemies to melee kill them while taking damage from their ranged weapons. Lastly, to compensate for this big buff I would add a marked for death debuff for 3 seconds after the effects wear off similar to the Crit-a-Cola. I think that this would make the weapon more usable and overall balanced. All feedback and contructive criticism is welcome. ~~Changes from its current form:~~ -Reduced movement speed bonus while under the effects from +35% to +15% -Removed damage vulnerability while under the effects -Added downside: The user is marked for death for 3 seconds after the effects wear off -Added +20% resistance from ranged source damage while under the effects"

I decided to move his drinks to their own post, as they are their own type of beast. The Scout's drinks take up his secondary slot, replacing his pistol and forcing him to rely on his Scattergun and Bat for combat. This means the Scout is lacking an effective weapon to fall back on when he runs out of Scattergun ammo and lacks the time to reload, as well as lacking an effective finishing weapon for escaping enemies. So what do the drinks offer in exchange for this? Bonk!, the oldest of the drinks, makes the Scout immune to damage for 8 seconds and allows him to see in the third person, at the cost of being unable to attack for the duration. Crit-a-Cola, on the other hand, allows you to deal mini-crit damage for 8 seconds with a decent boost to your already fast movement speed, as the cost of a marginal increase to the damage you take from all sources and a Mark for Death debuff for two seconds after the effect wears off. Effectively, the drinks act as partial on-hand bers, exchanging your back-up firepower for an immediate, recharging boost. Crit-a-Cola borders on an overpowered version of this boost but is often forgotten about in regular play, while the Bonk! is often underutilized despite its massive strength. They could use some tweaking, both individually and in general. A few generic changes I would make to them, as well as all weapons that aren't Jarate-styled, would be a removal of recharging, replaced with limited charges that must be recharged by crates, health kits, and the like. The drinks would have the following stats to limit their use, for instance: * Ammo Carried: 3 * Effect Duration: 8 seconds (same as now) * Cooldown: 30 seconds (begins as soon as drink is consumed. Drinking during this time will harm the player in addition to granting the usual effects, as well as reset the cooldown.) * Recharge Methods: Collect a small, medium or large health kit (1, 2 or 3 charges respectively) or visit a resupply locker. Dispensers would not dispense consumable items. I also considered the idea of making the drinks possible to share, like the Heavy's lunches. Pressing alt fire while an ally is within melee range of you will consume one ammo, imbuing that ally with the basic benefit of your equipped drink. Likewise, if killed while this is active, players run over your cola to gain the same basic effect for the duration. ----- **Bonk! Atomic Punch** ~~Drink to become invulnerable for 8 seconds. Cannot attack during this time.~~ A classic Scout utility, Bonk allows you to avoid damage altogether (barring certain environmental hazards) in exchange for being unable to attack. Apparently is used to have a fatigue penalty after its effect wore off, hence the achievement Retire the Runner. Useful for distracting sentries and passing through the enemy line. I don't personally have a problem with it, but I've seen tell that it's both overpowered and underpowered. Not sure what could fix that situation, but I have a few suggestions. I would suggest one of the following combinations of stats: A): Allow the Scout to fight while under the effects: * ~~Drink to evade most damage for 8 seconds.~~ *Evasion chance is 90%. Damaging entities the Scout evades (registers as 'MISS') pass through the Scout harmlessly but can still affect the area or other players. However, Damage over Time (burning, bleeding, ect) and cannot be evaded.* * ~~**+25% faster movement speed**~~ * ~~*You move 25% slower afterwards for 4 seconds*~~ * ~~*You have 20% damage vulnerability afterwards for 4 seconds*~~ B): Improve the current effects, but give them a cost to level the playing field for your enemies: * ~~Drink to evade all damage for 8 seconds~~ *Almost the same as current effect. However, the effect no longer stops damage over time effects like bleeding and afterburn, meaning you can be damage through it indirectly.* * ~~**Immune to all movement-impairing effects for 8 seconds**~~ *Makes it impossible for you to surf damage, but also prevents enemies from controlling your movement* * ~~*You move 25% slower afterwards for 2 seconds*~~ * ~~*You have 20% damage vulnerability afterwards for 2 seconds*~~ C): Replace the evasion effect, mechanically, with damage resistance (grazing shots effectively). Possibly allow you to fight while under the effects: * ~~Drink to reduce all damage taken by 75% for 8 seconds~~ *No longer allows you to evade damage, but allows you to surf damage with relative safety* * ~~**+25% faster movement speed for 8 seconds**~~ * ~~*You move 25% slower afterwards for 3 seconds*~~ * ~~*You have 20% damage vulnerability afterwards for 3 seconds*~~ ----- **Crit-a-Cola** ~~For 8 seconds:~~ ~~**All your attacks mini-crit**~~ ~~**+25% faster movement speed**~~ ~~*-10% damage vulnerability*~~ ~~*You are Marked for Death afterward for 2 seconds*~~ The second Scout utility created, Crit-a-Cola has been buffed over the years. Originally granting only mini-crits as the cost of receiving mini-crits, it has since been buffed with a speed boost and a replacement of 'damage taken mini-crits' with a negligible '-10% damage vulnerability', which does hardly anything to increase damage taken. Like others have suggested, I would return it to its original stats of both dealing and receiving mini-crits. However, I could see keeping the movement speed boost and/or perhaps even adding an identical boost to jump height as well, at the cost of making it difficult/impossible for medics to heal you while under the effects.

The best way to use this weapon in my experience is knowing where the team is and finding a good blind spot, and wait to strike, but your very vulnerable without that airblast, especially when there's a soldier near by. So by taking both of these facts into account I suggest this: **PHLOGISTINATOR** *Level 10 flame thrower* ~~**Build 'Mmmph' by dealing damage.

You get the speed boost regardless of the building's team or distance, as long as it is in your line of sight. Oh, and you need to have this weapon active to get the effect. The purpose of this is to allow you to reach your buildings faster in order to perform a quick repair or remove a sapper. This means you can stray further away from your nest without having your buildings get fucked over by a Spy too much. &gt; ~~**+10% move speed while hauling**~~ Pretty much just allows hauling without the -10% move speed penalty. You actually need +11.11% speed bonus to negate the hauling speed penalty, but just make it +10% because it looks nicer in the stats. &gt; ~~**Primary Fire: Pull in ammo packs**~~ I like how we can use explosions to knock dropped ammo packs to pick them up from a long distance, but that seems more useful for the Engineer. Too bad Engineer has to stand up and walk towards ammo packs to pick them up, but that can be changed. So, when you have this weapon active, you hold down primary fire while pointing at ammo packs to pull them in towards you from a long (but limited) distance. I don't know if it should be super duper fast like using the Gravity Gun from HL2, or only kinda-fast like reeling them in with a fishing pole line. If you have a full 200 metal supply, then maybe you can carry an ammo pack in the air (like grabbing something in HL2) so you can give them to your friendly Engineers. Also, using primary fire on ammo pickups (the floating ones which give 40/100/200 metal) would turn them into a physics object so you can also pull them in like the ammo packs dropped by players. Maybe also allow pulling in stickybombs? You could remove stickybombs from their position, but you risk having them detonate on you since you're pulling them in towards you. Kinda some sort of risk-reward thing. You could save your Sentry by pulling out the three stickies under it, but there's a huge risk of the Demoman blowing you up instead. &gt; ~~**Alt-Fire: +15% move speed while held down but drains 8 metal per second**~~ When you have this weapon out and you hold down alt-fire, you'll get +15% forward move speed and -15% backward move speed, however it drains 4 metal every 0.5 seconds until alt-fire is released. You don't get the speed boost if you have 0 metal, and it doesn't stack with the speed boost from pointing at buildings. The purpose of this is to allow the Engineer to reach the frontline faster so he can keep up with the other classes. It can also be used by combat Engineers to get in and out of fights faster."

There are not enough ways to cause fire damage for the Sun to outweigh its damage penalty, and the Sun also fails to outdo a Scattergun's damage against anyone (besides possibly light classes). The resistance to fire is nice but again, does not really help the weapon since only one class uses fire damage on a regular basis. My redesign of the weapon aims to make the weapon something of a hybrid of the Boston Basher and the Sandman (not including stun, don't worry) with fire in place of bleed, allowing it to combo with the Pyro's Axtinguisher and Sharpened Volcano Fragment (and weapons in general) without needing to rely on them: ~~**Alt-Fire: Launch a fireball that burns opponents**~~ ~~**100% crits vs. burning targets**~~ ~~*On Hit: Extinguish victim*~~ ~~*On Miss: Hit yourself.

I feel that Bonks! damage evasion mechanic should not be tampered with, it's what makes the weapon unique to everything else. I do however think the time you can evade for should be reduced, I changed it from 8 to 6 (Possibly even 5). A fair bit can happen in 2-3 seconds. I also extended the other downsides as with Bonks! damage evasion there needs to be some other form of after effect, otherwise it's essentially free damage evasion. The biggest change is the 100% force vulnerability, if the team co-ordinates properly they can propel the Scout far enough away that it essentially negates the Bonk!. --- **CRIT-A-COLA** ~~~~ ~~While Under the Effects: +25% Movement Speed, your Attacks mini-crit, you are Marked for Death for the duration of the effects.~~ ~~*User is Marked for Death for 2 seconds after effects have worn off*~~ --- **MAD MILK** ~~**Extinguishing teammates reduces cooldown by -20%**~~ ~~Players heal 50% of the damage done to an enemy covered with milk~~ ~~Can be used to extinguish fires~~ ~~{Hidden} For every enemy player covered in Milk -1 second of effect time~~ (I would also apply this mechanic to Jarate but I'll save that for another post) My thinking behind this initially was to change the way the Mad Milk functions to be similar to the Wrap Assassins Bauble. However that still doesn't solve the fact that 10 seconds of health regeneration for one team is very one sided. I instead thought about cutting that time down for every player affected by the Milk, which to me means that it instantly becomes less effective in groups of people and more effective in a 1v1 scenario. Milking all 6 players at once in a 6s match would cut the total time Milked to 4 seconds. The only issue I can see with this is that milking more than 9 players means the Milk is effectively cancelled out. I'm tossing up on wether to counter this by boosting the max Milk time (In a 1v1 scenario) to 12 seconds. This seems a little OP tho. Maybe someone could help me solve this. --- **ATOMIZER** ~~**Grants Triple Jump: The Third Jump deals 15 Damage when used**~~ ~~*-20 max health on wearer*~~ Before I'm crucified for the health reduction hear me out. I've put the health reduction there because (to me) it makes sense that if you have the passive ability to essentially dodge damage (ie. a 60+ damage rocket) for a measly 15 health, then you shouldn't be able to take said damage and live in the first place. I also upped the jump penalty from 10 to 15 to make it more risky to use the jump. Rather than running into battle, guns blazing and using the jump willy-nilly, The Scout now has to think when the appropriate time to use it is and use it accordingly. --- **SANDMAN** ~~~~ ~~Alt Fire: Launches Ball that Marks opponents for Death~~ ~~**On Headshot: Marked for Death duration is doubled**~~ ~~*30% Slower Weapon Deploy and Holster*~~ ~~{Hidden} The distance the ball travels determines the length of time the target is marked for death. (Same scaling as the current stun feature)~~ ~~{Hidden} The ball Marks for an extra 2 seconds on a critical hit.~~ (This is on the wiki. I didn't even know this was a thing) Note: The Bonk sound will still play upon a successful hit with the ball as it does now. Note: The initial charge time of the ball has also been left untouched. It currently sits at a 15 second re-charge, which prevents it from becoming a constant spammable to Stun (or in my re-works case Mark for Death) from a distance. However getting the ball back will still immediately re-charge the meter. I placed this rework on the Highlander Whitelist as well, but I was unsure for an appropriate downside. I decided upon the slower deploy &amp; holster over slower swing speed and doubled the penalty from 15% to 30%, meaning that you now have to somewhat time its use. I also added something that I saw suggested on another post about The Sandman. ""What if the ball could headshot?"" Now it wont do critical hit damage because that would mean little as the ball only does about 15 damage and it would only bring it to 45 if it did do crit damage. So I started thinking, what could make this even more unique and add the headshot function. The answer: Double the Marked for Death Duration. If a Scout can land the ""headshots"" with the ball I think that they should be rewarded for accuracy. It also incentivizes getting good at aiming it for a potential of Marking an enemy for Death for a maximum of 16 seconds. *Potential extra mechanic?* A thought crossed my mind, while my re-work of the Sandman is pretty balanced I thought about potentially adding the Beggars Bazooka deviation mechanic to the ball. While I know random chance mechanics are bad (That's common knowledge here) and TF2 is not a very realistic game, (...duh) my mind went straight to the mechanic after watching my friend try to hit a ball in the same spot multiple times with a bat and failing. The random deviation mechanic works for the Beggars Bazooka and it kinda adds some realism to the bat. I don't particularly think this is necessary but I thought it sounded pretty cool to apply. The deviation would probably only be about 1 or 2 rather than 3. Still an impact but not as heavy as the impact on the Beggars Bazooka. Take it or leave it, this mechanic is food for thought. --- **DISCIPLINARY ACTION** ~~**On Hit Ally: Boosts both players' speed for 2 seconds**~~ ~~*-25% Damage Penalty*~~ ~~*Consecutively Whip Boosting a single target will become less effective for the target after each consecutive boost, to a maximum of 60% less effectiveness*~~ (1st Boost Normal/2nd Boost -15%/3rd Boost -30% Effect/4th Boost -45% Effect/5th Boost -60% Effect) ~~*Whip target cannot be Whip Boosted for 2 seconds after a boost*~~ ~~{Hidden} Whip Boost does not stack with the Speed Boost granted by the G.R.U~~ Credit to my friends Caramel Slice &amp; Talon_Card for the mechanic alteration ideas. The point of running the Whip in 6s is to force the Heavy to mid faster with the rest of the team, (Who are most likely a lot further in front of the Whipper &amp; Whippee and will reach mid before them) effectively making the arrival earlier than natural for one class and a little later than desired for another. The idea for the changes proposed are that the Heavy would get to mid a lot later with the Soldier, who is babysitting him to mid. The consecutive Whip boosting de-buff would take effect quite quickly, slowing the advance a little. (Note: When I say consecutively Whip boosting this refers to Whip Boosting a single player repeatedly. This can be reset by Whip Boosting another player then going back to the intended target) To somewhat counter the way the previous function works so that it doesn't basically make Whip Boosting useless on a single target before getting halfway to mid, nor can it be severly broken by adding another player. I placed a de-buff of sorts to players who have been recently Whip Boosted disabling the Whip Boost for a short period after a short time. This means that to effectively rollout with Heavy to mid the Medic or another player would need to accompany them, effectively slowing the entire rollout for 3 players to mid &amp; being at a disadvantage at the start of the fight. Rolling out with just the Heavy &amp; Soldier going alone would make the Heavy arrive later than he would at the current rate of the weapon but still earlier than naturally intended. There was a lot of math involved in this particular re-work, the following is the math done to show the negative consecutive effectiveness downside and its effects on each class' speed. | Base Movement Speed (HU/s)| Speed Boost (HU/s) + % {1^st Whip} ~~0%~~| Speed Boost (HU/s) + % {2^nd Whip} ~~*-15%*~~| Speed Boost (HU/s) + % {3^rd Whip} ~~*-30%*~~| Speed Boost (HU/s) + % {4^th Whip} ~~*-45%*~~| Speed Boost (HU/s) + % {5^th Whip} ~~*-60%*~~| --------- | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | ~~Scout~~ | 400 | 505----26.3% | 489----22.4% | 473----18.4% | 456----14.5% | 442----10.5% ~~Soldier~~ | 240 | 336----40.0% | 321----34.0% | 307----28.0% | 292----22.0% | 278----16.0% ~~Pyro~~ | 300 | 405----35.0% | 389----29.75% | 373----24.5% | 357----19.25% | 342----14.0% ~~Demo~~ | 280 | 385----37.5% | 369----31.9% | 353----26.3% | 337----20.6% | 322----15.0% ~~Heavy~~ | 230 | 322----40.0% | 308----34.0% | 294----28.0% | 280----22.0% | 266----16.0% ~~Engy~~ | 300 | 405----35.0% | 389----29.75% | 373----24.5% | 357----19.25% | 342----14.0% ~~Med~~ | 320 | 425----32.8% | 409----27.9% | 393----23.0% | 377----18.04% | 361----13.1% ~~Sniper~~ | 300 | 405----35.0% | 389----29.75% | 373----24.5% | 357----19.25% | 342----14.0% ~~Spy~~ | 320 | 432----35.0% | 415----29.75% | 398----24.5% | 381----19.25% | 364----14.0% ~~Spy-2~~ | 320 | 425----32.8% | 409----27.9% | 393----23.0% | 377----18.04% | 361----13.1% Footnote: There are 2 Spy rows because the wiki lists the Spy as having the same Boost formula as the base classes but has the same speed as the Medic.

Since this item is not likely to be used in combat and more-so to get to Mid faster, I changed the damage received under the effects back to pre-MYM (With an extra 5% added I think) so the play-style this item presents in pubs is not forever lost (I like my Steak. The MYM change to it made me a little sad). The major change I proposed for this to work in competitive was to add a marked for death period for a lengthy period of time after the effects have worn off. This essentially means the Heavy arrives at mid and would either need to hide and be a liability or become a glass cannon in the fight. --- **DALOKOHS BAR** Since this weapon is banned due to a bug there is no need for a re-working.

I am assuming that it's ban is also Medic related as this item on its own would not last too long as every class in the game can chase the heavy down and merely being a damage sponge would only work for a few seconds at the most. My idea was to prevent a scenario wherein the Heavy can soak up massive amounts of damage and stay at the same health. Logically this makes sense although I am somewhat unsure if this fully addresses the problem at hand. --- **GLOVES OF RUNNING URGENTLY** ~~When weapon is active:~~ ~~**+30% Faster Move Speed on Wearer**~~ (Brings heavy to 99.67% Move Speed) ~~*-25% damage penalty*~~ ~~*You are marked for death while active, and for 8 seconds after switching weapons*~~ ~~*This weapon holsters 50% slower*~~ ~~*-60% Less Healing from Medic Sources*~~ Before I get the ""Why apply a healing penalty?"" question keep in mind that it's only in use when the weapon is active. This item is banned for the same reason as the Buffalo Steak Sandvich &amp; The Disciplinary Action, it allows the player to run Heavy to mid quickly with essentially no consequences. I applied the same thing to the G.R.U as I did the Fists Of Steel (In terms of the healing penalty) because in this scenario a Heavy arriving faster to the mid fight with a full buff for essentially no consequence is kinda dangerous. The other counter to the Heavy arriving at mid early I proposed was an extended Marked for Death period after the gloves are holstered. Much like my proposal for the Buffalo Steak Sandvich it is intended for the Heavy to either get to the mid fight and hide, being somewhat of a liability or become a glass cannon. With the G.R.U however the Heavy also has the option to holster the Gloves early and arrive at mid a little later without the Marked for Death penalty and keep the mid fight going. Kinda like my proposal the Disciplinary Action. --- **POMSON 6000** ~~~~ ~~**Does not require ammo**~~ ~~**Projectile cannot be deflected**~~ ~~**Projectile penetrates enemy targets**~~ ~~*Projectile damage reduced by 25% for each enemy penetrated*~~ ~~*Deals only 20% damage to buildings*~~ Taken from my Highlander Whitelist Post.

I also added no metal from dispensers as a measure to prevent sitting on one and just spamming projectiles away. The increase in distance for the primary fire is to show it a little love and make it less useless, it's basically useless at the moment.

While this is not exactly the same as his [Original Post,](URL I believe that with my changes it has been better refined to fit the Medics intended play-style. I placed this rework on the Highlander Whitelist as well, I received some feedback and thought it necessary to add the hidden stat listed on this Whitelist. It makes sense, If you build up the ""bers Popped"" with a Kritz, Quick-fix or Vaccinator you should not be able to pick up an ber and keep the faster built effects. Yes this item does mean the Vaccinator reaps its rewards infinitely more effectively than any other Medigun. No I didn't just realise that. You can't prove that. ^^^^Fuck... --- **SYDNEY SLEEPER** ~~**+10% Charge Rate per Enemy you have Coated in Jarate at the time of Scoping**~~ ~~**On Scoped Hit: Jarate target for 2 to 8 seconds based on amount charged**~~ ~~**Headshots or Fully Charged Shots cause an Explosion of Jarate**~~ ~~*Base charge rate decreased by 20%*~~ ~~*No Random Critical Hits*~~ ~~*No Headshots*~~ ~~{Hidden} For every enemy player covered in Jarate -1 second of effect time~~ (Same as Mad Milk) Credit to this items charge rate re-working goes to u/veidogaems. This item is banned because it can charge faster than a stock Rifle and still one shot Medics with it. The 25% faster charge meant that a Sniper could easily charge up a bodyshot, ready to drop the enemy Medic before anyone could react to you. Changing that to increased charge per enemy coated still allows a skilled Sniper to put out charged shots quickly, but only after gaining prior momentum, which with the coated player timer mechanic I added would be somewhat difficult. So the charge rate can't be boosted by using plain Jarate first I also lowered the base charge rate by 20%, not too much but not enough to completely nullify the upsides. It enables (In 6s) a potential maximum charge bonus of up to 40%. Note: Throwing the Jar of Jarate, soaking people the scoping will work the same as Shooting someone and coating them. --- **DARWIN'S DANGER SHIELD** ~~**+25 Max Health on Wearer**~~ ~~**+15% Bullet Damage Resistance**~~ ~~*+10% Critical Damage Vulnerability*~~ Credit to this glorious item re-working goes to u/veidogaems. This item is banned because it can enable the Sniper to survive a Headshot from another Sniper, forcing a constant advantage over the enemy Sniper if they too do not use it. This re-work lets you survive a fully-charged bodyshot (even from the Machina), but allows you to still die to uncharged headshots (Quickscopes) without an over-heal. I think Veidogaems has solved the Darwins Donger Problem... --- **RESERVE SHOOTER** This weapon is a doozy. I've tried my hand at balancing this and have failed many a time. I did however find a proposal that seems incredibly well balanced and actually appears to be a good fix. Credit to this re-work goes to u/TheRedstoneBlaze. I shall link back to his [original post](URL but there are some aspects that I have modified and I have simplified some of the notes so I will place it all here as well with my minor alterations and reasons for them. **THE FIRE MARSHALL** (Pyro Secondary) {No Modification to OP} ~~**This Weapon Deploys 20% faster**~~ ~~**Mini-crits vs. Burning players**~~ ~~*Damage dealt to Burning players decreases after-burn duration by 1 second for every 10 damage dealt*~~ ~~*-34% clip size*~~ NOTE: Dealing say, 80 damage to someone who has been burning for 2 seconds would extinguish them. **THE RESERVE SHOOTER** (Soldier Secondary) {Slight Modification to OP} ~~**This Weapon deploys 50% faster**~~ ~~**Mini-crits vs. targets launched airborne by explosions, grapple hooks or enemy attacks**~~ ~~**Weapon reloads while inactive**~~ ~~*-50% clip size*~~ ~~*-50% reload speed*~~ Splitting The Reserve Shooter was the only real way to properly balance it between the Soldier &amp; Pyro. The Fire Marshal split keeps the current aspects of the Reserve Shooter while ever so slightly modifying them to cater solely to Pyro by replacing Airborne with on Fire. However, it also has a new downside, damage done by this weapon will decrease after-burn duration. This makes it so that you can't get 10 full seconds of mini-crits on anyone you ignite. The Reserve Shooter itself for the Soldier is relatively fine, I changed the Crits on launched targets back to Mini-crits as top level players will most definitely abuse that feature heavily. I also removed the Crits on blast jump because again, high level players could abuse that by simply being lobbed up by any blast and get free hit-scan Crits. --- **THE B.A.S.E JUMPER** ~~(Hidden) Cannot deploy Parachute multiple times in the same blast jump~~ ~~*-50% Turn Rate while Deployed*~~ What I have been told is the reason for the B.A.S.E Jumpers ban is that Soldiers are able to stay waaaaaaay above the rest of the playing field and spam rockets down on everyone all the while being able to strafe away from most damage with the exception of hit-scan damage. With those reasons in mind I thought it necessary to make it so that once the parachute is deployed the player must land before being able to deploy it again. The other issue being the air strafing I have halved the effectiveness or ability to strafe as of the current models stats. --- Omitted Item Balances: These items (to me at least) don't seem to be able to be balanced adequately for the 6s gamemode. &amp;nbsp; **The Flying Guillotine** ~~*Ban Reason*~~ It is possible for people to spam this weapon through a choke point and hit players, dealing free damage via the Bleed debuff and encountering effectively no consequences. Increasing the re-charge timer (To about 9 or 10 seconds from 6) crossed my mind but that seemed like an idea that works on paper and not in action, not to mention its DPS would fall too far below the Pistols, making it unviable. While we don't want it banned for being ""OP"" or ""Being Abused"", at the same time we don't want it at the opposite end of the spectrum. I am still thinking for solutions on The Guillotine. Feel free to leave a suggestion or your thoughts on it if you have one. **The Wrangler** ~~*Ban Reason*~~ Sentry Guns slow the game down to almost a snails pace. The Wrangler enables a normally 300HP Sentry to have effectively 600HP with its damage reducing shield. Changing anything about this to address its problem that I can think of would alter the items unique identity, not to mention it would make the wrangler an almost unviable weapon in most situations if the shield (The main issue) were removed. **The Quck-Fix** ~~*Ban Reason*~~ This weapons boosted healing rate can essentially negate all damage the enemy team deals, not to mention that just to compete with your boosted healing the enemy Medic is also forced into running this weapon which then results in stalemates. I just can't think of anything to adequately balance it and not ruin the item. There was a little talk from B4nny a while ago about testing it out since it was altered slightly after MYM. Maybe he did and I missed it, maybe he didn't. In any case if you wanna go by the Quick-Fix's ideals of doing things quickly then I would suggest a shorter bercharge, but that still doesn't quite solve it basically negating the damage only 6 people can output. Altering the main issue with the Quick-Fix would alter it's identity as ""The Medigun to do it faster"". --- **NOT BANNED ITEMS** (But Should Probably Be &amp; Need Re-works Anyway) **MACHINA** ~~**On Full Charge: +15% Damage per shot**~~ ~~**On Full Charge: Projectiles Penetrate players**~~ ~~*20% Damage Vulnerability while Scoped In*~~ ~~*Cannot Fire unless Zoomed*~~ ~~*Fires Tracer Rounds*~~ Original poster for these stats is u/xXMisterDiscoXx however credit to the added stat goes to Aegis who thought of it on a stream. This change does make sense, to fully reap the rewards for this weapon the user must be Scoped in for a lengthy-ish period of time. Adding a damage penalty while Scoped turns the Sniper essentially into a glass cannon, but would not punish them when it becomes harder to retaliate. (Un-scoped) Note: While this weapon is not banned in the 6s Whitelist it is actually banned on Highlander Whitelists on the grounds of being a technical straight upgrade to stock. **AIRSTRIKE** ~~**-15% Blast Damage from Rocket Jumps**~~ ~~**Increased Attack Speed and Smaller Blast Radius while Blast Jumping**~~ ~~**Clip size increased on kill**~~ ~~*-25% clip size*~~ ~~*-15% damage penalty*~~ ~~*-10% explosion radius*~~ *The following transcript was taken from wiki &amp; altered to better communicate the re-works I proposed* While rocket jumping, its attack speed is increased by 50% {Was 65%}, explosion radius is further reduced by 20% (which is 28% smaller compared to a standard rocket's splash radius), and the rockets fired produce white contrails. In addition, on each kill using the weapon, its clip size is increased by one, up to 6 rockets after 3 kills. {Was 8 &amp; 4 respectively} My idea for these re-works are essentially lowering the insane amount of burst damage this weapon can acquire (Lowering max clip) along with lower said damage capability ever so slightly, so that it isn't complete and utter annihilation when this thing is fired. This is the best I can think of for this weapon and I'm still somewhat dissatisfied with it as it can still be considered a little OP. Note: While this weapon is not banned in the 6s Whitelist it is actually banned on Highlander Whitelists. I am also hold the firm belief that once somebody uses this weapon correctly in 6s it will be banned again. **LOCH-N-LOAD** ~~**+20% damage vs buildings**~~ ~~**+25% projectile speed**~~ ~~*-20% Damage vs Players*~~ ~~*-25% clip size*~~ ~~*-25% explosion radius*~~ ~~*Launched bombs shatter on surfaces*~~ Taken from my Highlander Whitelist re-work. While it is not the intention to turn the Loch-n-Load into the ""Designated Building Destroyer"" that's essentially how it needs to be balanced. Good Demomen who can and will/do land direct pipes do the same damage as the stock Grenade Launcher with faster projectiles and have a damage boost against buildings. There is nothing balanced about that. Rollers are good for spam and pressure yes (The roller argument is a popular argument I've seen for this one) but it doesn't compare to a quick peek and a speedy 100+ damage you can't react to. Lowering the damage to players is what is needed for this weapon. Note: While this weapon is not banned in the 6s Whitelist it is actually banned on Highlander Whitelists. &amp;nbsp; Welp. Perfect game balance is the ultimate goal. Let me know if I've overlooked anything or majorly fucked something up. Cheers if you read the entire thing. ^(I wonder if I can call this a Megathread...)"

Originally it was considered -the- pistol, granting 15 extra max health and passive fall damage immunity at the cost of a heavy fire vulnerability and a slow firing speed. Now many call it the weakest of the Scout's pistols, with its damage vulnerability and slow speed countering the variable health gain. Only the fall damage immunity remains useful, but even this is limited by how you must now have the weapon out in order to activate it.

Will post links later **Scatter-gun** *The Double Barreled Deathmatch tool of the Scout, gets 2 ejection ports(the oval panel thing or the right side of the scattergun's circular part is on both sides, in laymans terms) and a mode changer near the trigger for safe, single shot and two shot modes.* &amp;nbsp; ~~**You reload as fast as before, but you reload not by working the lever, but with putting shotgun shells into the scattergun.**~~ ~~**You work the lever just as fast as the firing speed in the current version**~~ ~~**You can use alt fire to change firing mode from single shot to two shot.**~~ &amp;nbsp; This means that your 6 shots are 3 shots, and the two shots act like a single Force A Nature shot. And it might be 3 FaN Shots, but it is 1 FaN Shot for the price of 2 scattergun shots. And unlike the Fan that reloads its entire magazine at once, the scattergun reloads one at a time, so something to consider when commentating. &amp;nbsp; ~~*you reload one shotgun shell at a time, regardless of the firing mode.*~~ ~~*Like for the FaN, the shots send you flying and mess up your aim. But it is good for crowd control and two shot boosts.*~~ ~~The awesome Scattergun has much more use now and hopefully the changes to the Soda Popper I made are not that OP now.~~ &amp;nbsp; **Stock Pistol, both scout and Engie.** *TF Industries standard service pistol. needs the Ejection port on the right side of the gun* ~~**Alt Fire is a mode change from single shot to 3 shot burst, and the opposite applies, aka from burst to single shot.**~~ ~~*For the burst shot it is inaccurate at longer ranges, but great at close range.*~~ ~~Still great and reliable magazine reloading pistol.~~ **Stock Bat** *A metal bat for the Scout as a melee and most useful as a finisher.* &amp;nbsp; ~~**Press alt fire to ""Wind up"" a strike.**~~ ~~**Wind Up is a minicrit charged up melee attack that can be done while under the effects of Bonk dodge Mode in a Can.**~~ &amp;nbsp; ~~*Buuuuut, the Wind up slows your movement down by 10 to 20% and you cannot double jump when winding up.*~~ ~~The wind up allows the stock melee to have a use.~~ Demoman's Bottle would have a 25 Hp on drink aka on taunt and +25 overheal, which is not much vs Medic Overheal.&lt;an example for other class stock melee betterment. **Scattergun changes.** This makes the Scattergun already better then it is, and offers more use. However, the reload one shot at a time is still a downside even for the twoshot. And while awesome, the two shot FaN characteristics, both behavior and damage wise it is more situational, and a two shot then single shot is the combo when in battle. Even Single Shot then two shot to evade then double jump is a way to use the two shot, because the single shot is the reliable damage dealing part of the weapon. **Stock Pistol** The thread with my pistol changes URL this Pistol on its own, offers great accuracy with its single shot mode, and a good burst shot mode with the alternate fire mode. however Single shot is good for long range shots and Burst fire is better at close range. couple this change to the Winger ideas, as in alt fire to charge up shots with minicritz, meaning minicrit damage and no falloff. winger is a pistol as a Sniper rifle. the PBPP ideas which are fall damage is a crouch special passive(good when you cannot double jump.) damage vulnerability is damage decrease and primary mode is HP on kill and alt fire changes it to 5 HP on hit, give the PBPP the role of the Finisher Pistol. **And that is why the Mad Milk needed changes. Because of the PBPP changes** Means that the Stock pistol and the Winger Pistol and the pocket Pistol have different uses, in this case: Stock Pistol is a all arounder, good at range with the normal single shot fire, and the 3 shot burst modes are good for close range. Winger has the jump height when active, but also the alt fire inspired by the Doom 2016 Pistols and their Mod Ability which is the charged shot. In TF2 that translates to minicrtiz(upgraded to critz in MvM) which have no falloff damage and because of that charged shot it is a good pick weapon and long range harass. PBPP is a finisher weapon, and as such it is scattergun blast and PBPP shoot and not PBPP is the main damage dealer, and the HP on hit mode is good for sort of regenerating you. Mad Milk was good for all around regeneration and team play and with addition of taunt is drinking it for 30HP and -20% charge, and +20% charge when exinguishing someone and 30HP milk bottle alt fire throw, that makes the Tweaked MadMilk a better support weapon that can be a proper vs to the Tweaked PBPP. &amp;nbsp; **Stock Bat** Ah the Stock Bat, so underused, so shunned in favor of the likes of Boston Basher and Atomizer and the Candy Cane, just to name a few. We know how to fix that. Adding a alt fire move called Wind Up Strike, allows for minicrit damage, and knockback. You might be slowed, and you might not use double jumps while charging the strike, but you will deal pain and a weaker version of the Atomizer shield ability. This makes the Atomzer a utility and Defense Melee while the Stock Bat gets the Damage Strike even when bonked. Only melee that can do that, by the way. How is that for a upside? This was taxing, but hopefully worth it. I hope you have a good rest of your day. What do you think? Good, Bad? OP, UP? No flaming and or trolling and no downvotes without comments please and thank you. "

I find that they either aren't particularly useful or are too costly to use. I'd rather them be combined into a single weapon, but since that isn't likely, I'd like toa sk people's thoughts on the following changes instead **Wrap Assassin** ~~**Alt-Fire: Launch a festive ornament that shatters causing bleed**~~ ~~**+25% increase in recharge rate**~~ ~~*65% damage penalty*~~ One of the two Smissmas update weapons for the Scout. It is a weak weapon that allows you to hit a weak projectile that causes bleed on hit and can shatter on impact, dealing minuscule damage in minuscule radius that leaves it useful primarily for retreating or long-range irritation. Since the Scout doesn't use his melee often however, it can be seen as a direct upgrade outside of Medieval mode. Instead of that, I'd offer the following changes: ~~**Alt-Fire: launch a festive ornament that shatters on impact, causing bleed to enemies in a small radius**~~ ~~*15% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ ~~*-60% damage penalty*~~ * Ornament Damage: 5 to 15 (reverse damage falloff). Crits on headshot * Splash Radius: 2.5 feet (40 HU) * Ornament no longer recharges. Scout instead carries one ornament on his person that must be resupplied at Dispensers, resupply cabinets or ammo crates* Edit: I forgot to mention: I would also change how Bleed works, to differentiate it a bit more from Afterburn and give it some use. Specifically, I'd reduce the damage and allow it to stack with itself (so if you hit a bleeding target with multiple baubles, for instance, the bleeding damage they would suffer per tick would increase with every strike on top of refreshing the duration), as well as give victims a damage vulnerability for the duration: * Bleed Damage per tick: 2 damage * Bleed Duration (standard for all weapons that cause Bleed): 5 seconds * Damage Vulnerability while Bleeding: +20% ----- **Candy Cane** ~~**On Kill: A small health pack is dropped**~~ ~~*25% explosive damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ The other Smissmas weapon. Its usefulness varies with whether or not you, an ally or an enemy reach the dropped health pack first, though the fact that the effect applies whenever you kill with any weapon is a nice feature. The price is a 25% explosive vulnerability, which gives rockets and grenades the potential to one-shot you if you miss a dodge or are caught off-guard. Due to the variable nature of this weapon, I would slightly tweak the stats to the following: ~~**On Kill or Assist: A small health pack is dropped on killers**~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ ~~*On Death: A small health pack is dropped on killers*~~ With this change, the health is now almost guaranteed to be gained by the Scout, as well as anyone whom he helps or who helps him finish off an opponent. However, not only is the Scout vulnerable to more sources now, but the Scout getting killed will heal whomever killed him. This weapon thus pushes the Scout to assist allies rather than go out on their own entirely, assisting allies in surviving fights while forcing them to avoid damage even more. ----- -Edit 1: Added suggestion for Bleed change."

More importantly, I find at least, is that the weapons do not offer the Pyro a new way to play. As it's been said before, the only thing these weapons do is let the Pyro play Pyro... better. That is sub-par, to say the least. Rather than let the weapon remain that way, I'd suggest the following changes to the Gas Jokey weapons. Rather than have them be nothing but semi-improved stock, I suggest they go with what the name implies: a support set, one that allows the Pyro to support Its allies at the cost of much of Its combat capabilities (with a special focus on the art of the Pybro). ----- **Degreaser** =Current Stats: ~~**This weapon deploys 60% faster**~~ ~~**This weapon holsters 40% faster**~~ ~~*66% afterburn damage penalty*~~ ~~*25% higher airblast cost*~~ The first attraction on our list, the Degreaser's major feature is the faster weapon switching it allows for. While nerfed from its original (near) instant switching, it is still extremely powerful, as it allows you to have an airblast on-hand with effectively any weapon active, as well as making weapon combos much easier than with any other weapon. Consensus is divided on weather or not this makes the weapon skilled; I side on the side of it makes the weapon unskilled, as it makes it easy to take out individual targets but removes your ability to attack groups effectively (the main purpose of a Pyro, albeit its a purpose not well realized). Since most of my Pyro changes are focused on improving his mobility and ambushing capabilities on one way or another, the Degreaser is going to focus on a more defensive-aspect, giving up much of its fire damage and its afterburn for the ability to dry soaked allies in addition to extinguishing them, which can be coupled with the ability to restore the health of friendly buildings. However, the weapon will no longer increase your switch speed. =New Stats: ~~**Airblast dries soaked allies and renders them immune to afterburn and soak effects for 5 seconds**~~ ~~**Repairs friendly buildings on damage and airblast**~~ *(Note 1)* ~~**100% crits vs. soaked and burning targets**~~ *(Note 2)* ~~*75% damage penalty*~~ ~~*Does not ignite targets*~~ *(Note 2)* * (Note 1): The rates would be: 50% of base damage on primary fire (effectively 1 health per particle with my damage nerf, or 25 health per second), and 50 health with an airblast. * (Note 2): The Degreaser would no longer ignite targets, a trait unique among the flamethrowers (and, since most weapons no longer rely on crit combos with my changes mentioned in my other posts, not as massive a downside as it would be otherwise). However, it has been reversed in its role as a combo weapon as a result. Rather than set up combos, the Degreaser now finishes them, dealing damage that pierces any flame resistance the enemy might have for the time that they are soaked or burning. This effectively caps the max amount of damage the Degreaser can do, but also allows it to counter enemies that might otherwise be resistant to a flamethrower. ----- **Powerjack** =Current Stats: ~~**When Active: 15% faster movement speed on wearer**~~ ~~**On Kill: 25 health restored**~~ ~~*When Active: 20% damage vulnerability*~~ The Powerjack is considered by many to be the best melee weapon the Pyro has, as it allows them to navigate the map faster than than they could otherwise, a massive boost in power for the class. As I have made this speed boost a passive for the class, it has been removed from this weapon. To replace it, I've improved its ability to deal damage slightly and made it more of a support weapon when working with friendly Engineers, especially those trying to move to the front lines. =New Stats: ~~**100% mini-crits vs. soaked targets**~~ ~~**Boosts building construction speed on hit**~~ *(Note 1)* ~~*While Active: 20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ ~~*20% slower firing speed*~~ *(Note 2)* * (Note 1): This boost will be equal to 1.25x added to the sentry's 'construction speed on hit' boost, 0.25 less than the stock wrench's. * (Note 2): The reduced firing speed is only to be made to keep the Powerjack firing speed in line with the stock wrench if my stock Pyro changes are put into practice (which include increasing the stock fire axe's damage and firing speed). Please ignore if assuming the game's current stock fire axe."
617,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,"[OP] ""Tweaking the Classes - Back Scratcher"" &lt;Pyro Melee&gt;",0,58kdw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/58kdw6/op_tweaking_the_classes_back_scratcher_pyro_melee/,2016-10-21 11:24:22,"**Back Scratcher** =Current Stats: ~~**25% damage bonus**~~ ~~**50% more health from health packs on wearer**~~ ~~*75% less health from healers on wearer*~~ *Includes dispensers, payload carts and Medics* The Back Scratcher is a weapon originally designed with Medieval mode in mind, while still retaining its use in regular play. Effectively an upgrade to the Fire Axe (increased damage and healing from packs at the cost of receiving less healing from Medics? Not only does that allow a Medic to milk you for ber if you have a Detonator or Scorch Shot, it also doesn't normally come into play since you should be ambushing enemies while going solo), it is considered one of the best of Pyro's melee weapons. I aim to tweak the weapon to continue assisting the solo Pyro, without it being a practical upgrade in the absence of payload carts, Medics and dispensers as well as making it more difficult to play with a team. (Please keep in mind, while the following stats should work with the current Back Scratcher, they are made with [my previous Pyro changes](URL in mind). =New Stats: ~~**On Hit: Make your victim bleed!**~~ *(Note 1)* ~~**On Kill: 50 health restored**~~ *(Note 2)* ~~*40% slower firing speed*~~ *(Note 3)* ~~*While Active: 20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ * (Note 1): I would also change how Bleed works, to differentiate it a bit more from Afterburn and give it some use. Specifically, I'd change the duration of Bleed to 5 seconds for all Bleed-inducing weapons (no more 6 second Tribalman's Shiv), reduce the damage to 2 per tick and allow it to stack with itself (so if you hit a bleeding target with the Back Scratcher multiple times, for instance, the bleeding damage they would suffer per tick would increase with every strike on top of refreshing the duration), as well as give victims a 20% damage vulnerability for the duration. * (Note 2): Health is also restored when a victim dies while suffering from the Bleed caused by this weapon. Also considering having it be like the Candy Cane and a kill with enemy weapon will restore the Pyro's health. * (Note 3): The slower firing speed is only necessary if my changes to the stock Fire Axe are implemented. Otherwise, please ignore this change. With these changes, the weapon is no longer such a massive upgrade to the Fire Axe. It can be used as a finisher to restore a chunk of your health or used as an opener against an enemy to weaken them in an ambush, but otherwise is weaker than the stock Fire Axe and leaves you slightly more vulnerable (not enough to be considerable most of the time though. 10% extra from anything is barely noticeable). ----- Edit 1: Changed the damage vulnerability to only be present while active. It should only be passive if the health-on-kill applied to all weapons while equipped."

After posting ideas for re-works that address the issues with said weapons being banned I received a lot of feedback on some items. Here are the fine tuned re-works of said items with the feedback taken into account. &amp;nbsp; **BONK! ATOMIC PUNCH** ~~Drink to Evade all Damage for 6 seconds~~ ~~*While under effects: 100% Vulnerability to Push Force taken from Damage*~~ ~~*25% Slower Move Speed for 3 seconds after effects have worn off*~~ ~~*20% Damage Vulnerability for 3 seconds after effects have worn off*~~ Changed Damage Vulnerability from 6 seconds to 3. 6 seconds was a little too long to be sustaining that much extra damage. A single anything would have effectively meant death. --- **CRIT-A-COLA** ~~While Under the Effects: +25% Movement Speed, your Attacks mini-crit, you are Marked for Death for the duration of the effects~~ ~~*User is Marked for Death for 3 seconds after effects have worn off*~~ Changed Marked for Death period after-effect from 2 to 3 seconds. My logic behind this isn't quite solid, I'm actually not entirely sure whats driving me to up the period but I get a feeling nobody will complain about it being too harsh considering what the Crit-A-Cola does for the Scout. --- **MAD MILK** ~~**Extinguishing teammates reduces Cooldown by -20%**~~ ~~Players heal 50% of the damage done to an enemy covered with milk~~ ~~Can be used to extinguish fires~~ ~~{Hidden} For every enemy player covered in Milk -10% effect time~~ (Compounding) The initial idea I had was to reduce the coat time by 1 second for every enemy coated. Seeing as that essentially breaks the item in HL &amp; pubs it was suggested by u/TheRedstoneBlaze to make it reduce by 10% compounding for each player coated in the substance. This both prevents it from breaking when used on larger groups of players and keeps a decent coat time on the enemy. Specifically for 6's this rework essentially halves the time the Mad Milk would currently be applied for if it were used. meaning there is less time to act upon the utility the item provides. I also kept the reduced healing. (Was 60% now 50%) Math Below: Formula: *10 x 0.9^victims* Formula| Seconds Coated| --------- | :---------: | 10 x 0.9^1| 9 Seconds Coated 10 x 0.9^2| 8.1 Seconds Coated 10 x 0.9^3| ~7.3 Seconds Coated 10 x 0.9^4| ~6.6 Seconds Coated 10 x 0.9^5| 5.9 Seconds Coated 10 x 0.9^6| 5.3 Seconds Coated 10 x 0.9^7| ~4.8 Seconds Coated 10 x 0.9^8| 4.3 Seconds Coated 10 x 0.9^9| ~3.9 Seconds Coated 10 x 0.9^10| ~3.5 Seconds Coated 10 x 0.9^11| 3.1 Seconds Coated 10 x 0.9^12| 2.8 Seconds Coated Note: All times marked with ~ have been rounded up to the nearest tenth, everything else is either exact or rounded down following the normal rounding rule. **JARATE** ~~**Extinguishing teammates reduces Cooldown by -20%**~~ ~~Coated enemies take Mini-crits~~ ~~Can be used to extinguish fires~~ ~~{Hidden} For every enemy player covered in Jarate -10% effect time~~ (Compounding) Note: The change applied here is the same as the Mad Milk change. It makes sense to apply it to Jarate as well as the Mad Milk --- **SANDMAN** ~~**Alt Fire: Bruiser! Launches Ball that applies a 15% Damage Vulnerability**~~ ~~**On Headshot: Damage Vulnerability is doubled to 30%**~~ ~~*50% Slower Weapon Deploy and Holster*~~ ~~{Hidden} The distance the ball travels determines the length of time the Damage Vulnerability is applied~~ (Same scaling as the current stun feature) ~~{Hidden} The Damage Vulnerability is applied for an extra 2 seconds on a Critical Hit~~ ~~{Hidden} 2 Random Deviation applied to Ball~~ Re-worked Marked for Death Mechanic. Now applies a 15% Damage Vulnerability for a timed period upon a successful ball hit. I was told that this combo'd with any power class would effectively mean a Medic could be killed with one hit (Or a one-two combo in a second or two), not to mention hiding would become a little more difficult as there is a giant Skull &amp; Crossbones above the victims head. I also never got feedback on the  deviation thought. As there is little in the way of downsides for this weapon I have added that, but I am unsure if it is too harsh considering the randomness of the mechanic. I also upped the holster &amp; deploy time to further emphasise the importance if timing such a crucial power (The Ball) correctly. I am tossing up wether or not to add ~~*30% Less Over-heal from Medics*~~ to the fray. I'm unsure if it is needed as the hidden ball deviation could already be enough of a downside. Let me know eh? --- **BUFFALO STEAK SANDVICH** ~~While under the effects: Movement Speed is Increased (By roughly 35%), Attacks Mini-crit, Damage taken will be increased by 15%, and the player may only use Melee Weapons for 15 Seconds~~ ~~*Player is restricted to Melee weapons for 5 seconds after the effects have worn off*~~ ~~Alt-fire: Share with a friend (Medium Health Kit)~~ Changed marked for death period to melee restriction. The idea behind doing this was to encourage the Steaks use to be a melee enhancement rather than just a rollout tool in 6s. Granted melee fights in 6s aren't really a thing but I'm more-so looking towards casual and pubs for this part, so as to not loose this little gem of a weapons unique &amp; hilarious play-style to the competitive re-balances. It conveniently balances it for 6's as well, since the Heavy can get to mid faster but essentially can't do anything when he gets there until the restriction wears off. --- **GLOVES OF RUNNING URGENTLY** ~~When weapon is active:~~ ~~**+30% Faster Move Speed on Wearer**~~ (Brings heavy to 99.67% Move Speed) ~~*-25% damage penalty*~~ ~~*You are marked for death while active, and for 5 seconds after switching weapons*~~ ~~*This weapon holsters 50% slower*~~ ~~*-60% Less Healing from Medic Sources*~~ Reduced Marked for Death period from 8 seconds to 5 seconds. 8 seconds is too much time to have a Marked for Death period. (The current Marked for Death period after switch is 3 seconds, upping it by 2 seconds seems like a good thing) --- **SYDNEY SLEEPER** ~~**+10% Charge Rate per Enemy you have Coated in Jarate at the time of Scoping**~~ ~~**On Scoped Hit: Jarate target for 2 to 8 seconds based on amount charged**~~ ~~**Headshots or Fully Charged Shots cause an Explosion of Jarate**~~ ~~*Base charge rate decreased by 20%*~~ ~~*No Random Critical Hits*~~ ~~*No Headshots*~~ ~~{Hidden} For every enemy player covered in Jarate -10% effect time~~ (Compounding) Applied the Jarate coat time Mechanic as seen earlier. --- **THE WRANGLER** ~~Take manual control of your Sentry Gun~~ ~~Wrangled Sentries gain a 250 health Shield that absorbs Damage &amp; Repair by 66%~~ ~~The Shield takes 3 seconds to fully charge~~ ~~Sentries are disabled for 3 seconds after becoming un-wrangled~~ ~~{Hidden} As the Shield charges the Health of the Shield scales with the charge~~ ~~{Hidden} The damage blocked by the Shield is applied to the Shield itself. No damage is completely nulled like the current Wrangler. The Damage is split between the Shield &amp; Sentry Gun~~ ~~{Hidden} After taking 250 Damage the Shield Shatters and will not begin recharging for 5 seconds~~ ~~{Hidden} The Shield gains an extra 15% resistance boost to the first type of damage it takes. Resistance is reset upon un-wrangling~~ (Sentry must re-activate to be counted as Un-wrangled, not just switching weapons.) *Resistance boost is calculated and applied after the general resistance calculation is made* Note: The Shields health functions the same way an upgrading, re-deployed Sentry Guns health works. If it takes damage while being charged it will reach 100% charge and have minus health dependant on the amount damage it took before the charge was complete. Time| Charge %age| Shield Health| --------- | :---------: | :---------: | 0 Seconds| 0%| 0HP 0.5 Seconds| 16.5%| ~41HP (41.25) 1 Second| 33%| ~82HP (82.5) 1.5 Seconds| 50%| 125HP 2 Seconds| 66.5%| ~166HP (166.25) 2.5 Seconds| 83%| ~207HP (207.5) 3 Seconds| 100%| 250HP The idea for this was to nerf/re-work the shield aspect of the Wrangler as that is one of, if not the prime reason for its ban in the 6's Global Whitelist. The current Wrangler Shield can take 8 Rockets at point blank range to before the sentry gun is destroyed. (Assuming the Engineer is not repairing) That's approximately 800-900 total Damage that's been output. Since they are not treated as separate entities individually affected by damage at the moment, the shield can literally void a significant amount of damage and not be affected whatsoever. My idea to fix this was to make the shield affected by damage, a similar-ish way to how Reinhardts Shield works in Overwatch now that I think about it. That's what a shield is supposed to do, take some damage and break after taking its limit, not entirely void damage and be unaffected. I decided to keep its flat 66% resistance, but change said resistance to a division. (If that makes sense) None of the damage is voided like the current Wrangler, it is divided between the Sentry Gun &amp; the Shield. If the shield needs to be toned back a little let me know. I'm still a little unsure about 250... --- ***EXPERIMENTAL*** **THE QUICK-FIX** ~~berCharge increases healing by 350% and grants immunity to movement-impairing effects~~ ~~**+20% Faster Crit Heal Ramp-up**~~ (Crit Heal Ramp-up is now 8 Seconds, 10 Seconds &amp; 13 Seconds rather than 10 Seconds, 12.5 Seconds &amp; 15 Seconds) ~~**+10% berCharge rate**~~ ~~*25% Shorter bercharge*~~ ~~*50% max over-heal*~~ ~~Mirror blast jumps and shield charges of patients~~ I am in the process of attempting to get a mod made to accurately calculate the numbers and HP/s and wether or not it makes a significant impact in a game of 6's. If anyone knows any modders by chance, could you please let them know &amp; spread this about. Also if somebody wants to run the numbers and reliably give solid answers I'll take those too. Just know that this one is still in the works and incomplete due to the numbers issues. (I can't math :/) Specifically when I ask to run numbers I'm asking a comparison of the Quick-Fix's current state vs. this new proposal and their Healing capabilities along with a stock comparison. ie. * Quick-Fix current healing at normal ramp up (10, 12.5 &amp; 15 Sec) is 33.6HP/s, 67.2HP/s &amp; 100.8HP/s. * My proposal with accelerated ramp up (8, 10 &amp; 13 Sec) is 24HP/s, 48HP/s &amp; 72HP/s. * Stock healing &amp; ramp up (10, 12.5 &amp; 15 Sec) is 24HP/s, 48HP/s &amp; 72HP/s. In the 15 second time period of a normal ramp up I would like to know how much total healing the Mediguns can dish out. If this all seems oddly specific feel free to PM me and ask for more details on the matter. (If you're running numbers) I'm still going to try to get a mod made to test it in game tho. Credit to u/Thesteam for the Crit Heal Ramp-up idea. &amp;nbsp; Fuuuuuuck... Re-working/re-balancing the Wrangler &amp; Quick-Fix were both really stressful for some reason..... I also regret to say that the Guillotine was just doing my head in, I've given up trying to balance that."

They are mostly W-M1 weapons that are not fun to play against, but also underpowered. Both share one flaw: Severe nerfs to airblasting. Nerfing airblast makes a flamethrower pretty much worthless, it's a core part of the class. It would be like making a medigun without uber. So I purpose, for the most party, just taking away MOST penalties to airblast and replacing them with something else. Let's start with the Phlog. The Phlogs has two problems. No airblast means its not fun or effective for you for most of the time. Then you build Mmmmph and no one has fun for about ten seconds. I decided to nerf Mmmmph but make the Phlog better when you dont have Mmmph. **The Phlogistinator** ~~**Dealing damage builds ""Mmmmph."" Hit alt to taunt and use your Mmmmph. You can have up to 500 damaged stored and for every 2 damage, your Mmmmph heals one point. For every 5, you get a 1% speed boost. If you dealt at least 250 damage, you get minicrits. Effect lasts for 1 second for every 50 damage dealt.**~~ ~~*-20% damage when below 50% HP*~~ ~~*30% less healing from all non-Mmmmph sources.*~~ This one seems complicated but I think its a good idea overall. It can help lonewolf pyros, and Mmmph can be used before a fight to turn the tide, but its not so OP so you can rush in with impossible odds and still win. I took out no airblasts and replaced it with stuff to discourage W+M1. Might need to rework the downsides The next weapon to be reworked is the Backburner. It pretty much has no use but W+M1. I tried to discourage that and encourage ambush tactics instead. **The Backburner** ~~**Full crits from behind, in a 120 degree angle**~~ ~~*20% more damage vulnerability when you have the backburner out*~~ ~~*10% slower movement if youve fired the Backburner in the past 3 seconds. (You can air blast, but no flames.)*~~ I would hope would-be W+M1ers would see the slow movement and damage vulnerability and switch weapons. Also still being able to airblast means it can be used seriously as a flanking weapon. You need to be careful not to incur the movement penalty, which forces you to think first flame later. Im not too good at weapon design, really I think that the debuffs mostly need work. But I hope this is a good start to what could re-balance two weapons that seem like they would be fun to use, if they were tweaked. "

[Video in Question](URL --- Basically, the problem with this weapon isn't on pubs, but mainly in Competitive. In pubs the current downsides are somewhat noticeable with the tracer rounds and Sniper's usually staying in one spot plus there's around 24 players in pubs, but in competitive there are basically no downsides. Because one; the ""Cannot fire unless zoomed"" downside is kinda useless in Competitive because usually all Competitive Snipers never fire while unscoped, they will most likely try to go for the headshot and not the noscope bodyshot and with these high skilled Platinum Snipers they can land that headshot most of the time and two; the ""Fires tracer rounds"" downside isn't going to effect the Sniper that much, if the Sniper hits or misses then everyone would know where he is and would know that they have a Sniper on the enemy team however in competitive, Snipers tend to go for one or two shots and after a successful or non-successful hit they move into another spot and take another few shots and visa versa Overall, this weapon in Competitive (and even in pubs sometimes) has no downsides, it deal more damage and the downsides basically negate the upsides and no different playstyles as it basically is the stock Sniper Rifle but deals more damage and is [banned from most of the Competitive leagues for a good reason.](URL Now for the idea for a nerf to this weapon, when I was on Aegis stream a few days ago I asked him what nerf would he give to the Machina so it would be unbanned from most of the Competitive leagues and he said that it should have a damage vulnerability while active which after thinking about it was actually a good idea, now you would get one shot from explosives with and without the Darwin's Danger Danger Shield making you more of a glass cannon (dealing more damage while taking more damage) which is a good trade off in my books."

I think that for starters the two items combined(meaning steak and claws) should have 35% damage vulnerability aka mincrits on wearer. This ensures that it is somewhat usable compared to the 55% damage vulnerability of the steak and claws. **Buffalo Steak Sandwitch** *While under the effects, move speed is increased, attacks mini-crit, damage taken will be increased 25%, and the player may only use melee weapons. Alt-fire: Share with a friend (Medium Health Kit)* ~~**Minicrits when you use it.**~~ ~~*25 percent damage vulnerability, and the fact that most melees have some downside.*~~ ~~A raw steak for a Heavy.~~ My suggestion is the following **Buffalo Steak Sandwich** *While under the effects, move speed is increased, attacks mini-crit, damage taken will be increased 20%, and the player may only use melee weapons. Alt-fire: Share with a friend (Medium Health Kit)* ~~**minicrits, and the fact that you can stack the speed with the speed increasing melees, so Eviction notice and this is a good combo.**~~ ~~*15% damage vulnerability, and melee only for the duration for the effects. Changed vulnerability from 20% to 15%.*~~ ~~can have some good combos and manageable ones at that. Would the Speed boost stacking be a just so you know neutral attribute or not?~~ ~~This is a Steak cooked rare with some spices that activate a Battle Frenzy effect on the Heavy. much better than a raw steak. /joke~~ This makes it a bit more manageable but still rewarding to use on a Heavy. Combine the minicrits and the speed stacking and you could be a fast Heavy, well faster than the normal Heavy at any rate. Also this is a random idea, but maybe overheal of 25 HP when you eat the Steak might help a bit for the tanky class, right? The Steak(which is probably cooked rare and has some spices with Battle Frenzy effects) is supposed to Psyche you up for fighting. And small HP overheal(considering that the Heavy with a small Med Pack gets 60 HP) of 25 HP is kind of a good thing in that regard, yes? **Warriors Spirit** *These are Bear Claws with team colored tape as a fist weapon.* ~~**On kill, you get 50 HP.**~~ ~~**30% more damage.**~~ ~~*30% more damage when active.*~~ ~~No neutral attribute~~ My suggestion for the Warrior's Spirit is the following: **The Warrior's Spirit.** *Bear claws with team colored tape wrapped around the Heavy's hands.* ~~**On hit: get 10HP.**~~ ~~**On kill: get 50HP.**~~ ~~**Minicrits are crits**~~ ~~**it has the increased damage, but maybe switch the damage and swing speed with the Eviction notice?this way, the Claws are about quick slashing and kills for HP, while the Knuckledusters are hardhitting speed related on hit and on kill.**~~ ~~*15% damage vulnerability when active.*~~ ~~*No random crits.*~~ ~~the Healing can overheal. And slower holster time.~~ Before you go into a rage about the HP on hit and kill and overheal of both actions, a reminder that the Small MedPack is 60 HP for a Heavy. Therefore the fact that on hit you get 10 Hp on hit and on kill you get 50 HP is practically a small Medpack for the Heavy. And overheal is for rewarding the Heavy player that wants to charge into battle and get some melee kills in. You can say it rewards a Heavy who has the Spirit of a Warrior?/joke. I hope that this is somewhat satisfactory as a proposed change to these items. I had help when I did research for this with information from the Heavy Main Rydercycle. He has a youtube chanel. Edit, maybe switch the damage and swing speed of the Warrior's Spirit with the Eviction notice? that way, you have hard hitting Knickledusters for a Heavy that wants speed, and Fast slashing Bear Claws for HP. What do you think of my suggestions? Are they Op,UP? good Bad? No trolling and or flaming please and thank you. "

My set changes idea is a maybe. Edit, what about 5 shots, but killing with the Winger increases the magazine size by 1 to a max of 4 kills, caps at 9 shots? In dual wield mode that is 2 shots per kill, meaning start from 10, and get 18 shots. Also, in MvM the shots on kill do not count as base magazine size, but it is mag upgrade from 5 shots plus shots from kill. Alternatively, the No1 Fan Set change, no damage increase but yes to a magazine increase and no random crits, but the Winger and the Atomizer are minicritz are critz weapons. As well as the Wnger being the jump height. **Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol** PBPP, needs the damage vulnerability changed to damage decrease of the pistol, yes by 20% and the HP on hit to HP on kill, that overheals, 30 or 40 HP on kill will be satisfactory for the kill, but the overheal is 25HP. Edit: also dual wield has the HP on hit instead of the HP on kill. **Some ideas related to the Dual wield** Actually what if the secondary could have an off hand type of thing? Like you can have a Pistol as well as some of the Colas? Or cleaver and pistol. milk and a Pistol. Engies pistol and short circuit, or Wrangler. Hell that would mean that Heavy could get Shotguns and the foods for primary and secondary fire, respectively. although that would mean that you eat on taunt and throw on alt fire. **Idea for the Engie** Also, what if the Engie could use the Scouts pistols?

Watch with glee as enemies slip up and go flying all over the place! **** **Cosmonaut's Capable Compatibility Pack** *Level 1 Spaceflight Gear* ~~**May be equipped in either the Primary or Secondary slot**~~ ~~**Wearer cannot drown while submerged in water**~~ ~~**+5 health returned per second on wearer (doubled if equipped in the Primary slot)**~~ ~~**+15% faster movement speed on wearer**~~ ~~**Wearer jumps 30% higher than normal (doubled if equipped in the Primary slot)**~~ ~~*+15% bullet vulnerability*~~ This cosmonaut's backpack is a very special item, not quite replacing either the Minigun or the Shotgun for the Heavy. It provides plenty of stat boosts on the wearer, some of which are doubled if the user equips the CCCP in their Primary slot. Of course, to compensate for all these boosts, the user gains a vulnerability to bullets - spacepacks are not suited for combat, after all. **** **Houston's Problem** *Level 10 Spaceflight Gloves* ~~**Hitting an enemy deals huge knockback, sending the victim flying away**~~ ~~**Wearer jumps 30% higher and falls 50% slower than normal while active, and for 3 seconds after this weapon is holstered**~~ ~~**+30% faster switch-to speed**~~ ~~*Deals 85% less damage*~~ Capture the essence of low gravity by sending enemies flying as though you're both up in orbit! If you find yourself being pursued by a foe, just whip out this weapon and slap them back where they came from! Plus, you can use the additional stats while the weapon is active to get in places that are hard to reach, or perhaps even to do some surprise mid-air shots with your Minigun/Shotgun after switching away from the weapon."
639,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,"[IG/OP] ""Overpowered Weapon Changes"" &lt;Multiple Classes, Multiple Slots&gt;",1,4uh396,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/4uh396/igop_overpowered_weapon_changes_multiple_classes/,2016-07-25 15:54:24,"A lot of people seemed to really like most of my changes from [my previous thread](URL so I decided to make a new list of my proposed weapon changes. These are for nerfing weapons that are too unfun or unfair to play against while keeping it balanced and still fun for the player to use. So without further ado, let's get started. Note that since these are weapons I'd like to see nerfed, some weapons I may be very uncertain about, so feedback for this one is DEFINITELY appreciated. -- **The Soda Popper** *Level 10 Scattergun* ~~**+25% faster firing speed**~~ ~~**25% faster reload time**~~ ~~**On Hit: Builds Hype**~~ ~~*-66% clip size*~~ ~~When Hype is full, Alt-Fire to activate Hype mode for multiple air jumps.~~ ~~This weapon reloads its entire clip at once.~~ With this nerf, the Soda Popper's firing speed is halved so that its DPS wasn't higher than the Scattergun's like it was before. There's not really much to talk about this one except that a lot of people thought that people could die too quickly to a Soda Popper Scout even without the Hype meter full. -- **Crit-a-Cola** *Level 5 Lunch Box* ~~While under the effects,~~ ~~+25% movement speed, your attacks deal +35% damage, damage taken increased by 20%, and cannot be crit-boosted.~~ ~~You are marked for death afterward for 4 seconds.~~ While nerfed in the Meet Your Match update, this weapon continues to be imbalanced, as the marked for death penalty is too small to be taken advantage of. Complaints about this weapon are that the Scout's damage vulnerabilities are too low and that the Scout's damage output is too high from mid range because of mini-crits ignoring damage fall off, allowing for meatshot damage at further distances. To balance this, I propose that the mini-crits are replaced with a +35% damage bonus, which allow for the same damage at close ranges, while less damage occurs from further ranges. To also discourage Medics using Kritzkriegs to further the damage, the Scout may not be crit-boosted under its effects. A small thing to add, but I think necessary. Along with the mini-crit removal, the Crit-a-Cola also comes with an increased vulnerability, making the Scout able to be one shot from a meatshot or close range rocket, which makes 1v1s a bit more fair to go against. I also doubled the marked for death penalty so that the Scout would be in more danger after the effects wear off, which can be prevented if the Scout retreats from the battle for a long enough time. -- **Quickiebomb Launcher** *Level XX Stickybomb Launcher* ~~**-0.2 sec faster bomb arm time**~~ ~~**Max charge time decreased by 50%**~~ ~~**Up to +25% damage based on charge**~~ ~~**Able to destroy enemy stickybombs**~~ ~~*-25% clip size*~~ ~~*-15% damage penalty*~~ ~~*Stickybombs fizzle 4 seconds after landing*~~ The Quickiebomb Launcher is another weapon that I'd like to see nerfed, but only back to its original form back before the update. The weapon was already a powerful weapon in the right hands, but now it is just ridiculous. A single charged up sticky can deal 142 damage, which can one shot any light class, and the quicker bomb arm time makes the Demoman able to deal with Scouts even easier. Traps now deal even more damage than before when stickies are charged up, and though the clip size can hurt in some situations, in any other situation, it seems that this weapon surpasses the stock Stickybomb Launcher in every way. From my experience in my competitive matches, I've found myself abusing the Quickiebomb Launcher every time, and it feels too easy to use. -- **Darwin's Danger Shield** *Level 10 Shield* ~~**+25 max health on wearer**~~ ~~(Unlisted: bullet resistance is moved to the Sydney Sleeper, which is increased to +20%)~~ When this weapon first came out, the Sydney Sleeper, Bushwacka, and Ol' Snaggletooth could be worn together so that the wearer could be unable to die from a headshot (which I'm glad was changed because honestly if Valve did the same thing now, there would be a shitstorm brewing with all the complaints about the game going P2W). When the set bonus was removed, they gave the Danger Shield the bullet vulnerability so that Snipers still had 7 health when hit by a headshot. Considered to be the most annoying weapon in the game, removing all vulnerabilities and resistances hopefully will allow the Sniper to gain survivability in the middle of a fight, while still making him vulnerable against his counter: other Snipers. In order to keep the original set's intentions alive and well, the bullet resistance the shield gains will be moved to the Sydney Sleeper, and will be increased to +20%. This means that a headshot with just the Syndey Sleeper equipped will leave the Sniper with 5 health, while with the shield it leaves the Sniper with 35 health. Since the Sydney Sleeper does not deal headshots, I feel that this would be an appropriate change, and hopefully the bullet resistance will urge Snipers to use the Sydney Sleeper more. -- **The Red-Tape Recorder** *Level XX Sapper* ~~**Reverses enemy building construction**~~ ~~**Building deconstruction increased by +25%**~~ ~~*-100% Sapper damage penalty*~~ ~~*When sapper is destroyed, buildings will rebuild to their original state when sapper was applied*~~ I shouldn't put this really as an OP weapon, but it still VERY annoying to use against Engineers. It only takes a little less than 3 and a half seconds to downgrade a building, making more work for the Engineer if he isn't glued to his buildings. This change makes it so when RTR sappers are removed, they rebuild to the same level they were when they were sapped, so if a Level 3 Sentry was sapped and the sapper was removed, it will rebuild into a Level 3 again. There will still be a delay as the buildings upgrade again though, which allows the Spy who sapped it to deal some damage to the Engineer to kill him, or at least hurt him enough before sapping the building again or cloaking away. With this change, the Spy can still perform his duty of nullifying the Engineer's buildings and destroying them, while destroying the sappers for the Engineer aren't as a pain as before to deal with."

I've also added in some HP recovery when eating it, to allow the Heavy to heal up before a push should he need to. **Dalokoh's Bar** ~~**Adds +50 max health for 30 seconds.**~~ ~~**While under the effects: Regenerate 5 HP/sec**~~ ~~Alt-fire: Share with a friend (Small Health Kit)~~ A slight buff, the Dalokoh's Bar has always been the Secondary for Heavies who don't have a Medic to take care of. It's also slightly better for initiating a fight with increased HP while the Sandvich has been about recovering after or during a fight. The health regen. effect increases the Heavy's ability to support himself without a Medic, while also increasing synergy with the Warrior's Spirit, as you'll heal 350 HP over the next 30 seconds rather than the 200 HP you'd get if you weren't stacking the effect with the Warrior's Spirit. ***** A few numbers about the Warrior's Spirit + Buffalo Steak Sandvich combo.

642,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,"[IG] ""Heavy"" &lt;Heavy, All Slots&gt;",5,4v4y0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/4v4y0y/ig_heavy_heavy_all_slots/,2016-07-29 14:51:21,"It's well understood by the community that Heavy has often received the short stick. Hell, his motto has practically gone from ""Shooting good!"" to ""It's nerf, or nothin'."" So today, I wanna suggest some changes to the Heavy, from weapon balances to class balances, and everything in between. **** **Heavy** *Level 2 Mistreated Mascot* ~~Moves at 80% speed. Heals 3 Health per second when not connected to a Medigun or Dispenser beam.~~ ~~Damage received builds an ""URAH!"" Meter. When full, press the Special Key to provide minicrits, damage resistance, and a speed boost to the user and allies within a radius for 8 seconds.~~ The first change is a slight speed buff to make the Heavy as fast as the Soldier. It's not a terribly good or bad change, but it makes it so that he's not horrendously slow anymore. The second change has him recovering 3 health per second, so long as he isn't being pocketed or standing near a dispenser. This gives him more viability outside of just being a pocket target. Lastly is the big class change: a supportive buff. If the Soldier can use backpacks to give a nice boost to nearby allies (as well as himself), then surely Heavy should have something similar? After all, the Heavy can take more damage, and would thus be able to utilize a supportive buff better. **** **All Heavy Primaries** *Level 4 Miniguns* ~~**Damage dealt builds a ""BULLET!"" meter. When full, press Reload while the primary is deployed to deal minicrits for 6 seconds.**~~ The miniguns are already the Heavy's best tools, but more often than not they can be outmatched by a quicker class. Thus, I think the Heavy, as someone who can deal plenty of damage output, should be able to build up a meter with his primary weapons and get some minicrits. These could be used in a life-or-death situation, such as when a class gets too close (think Pyro or Scout); activate the minicrits, and stop them before they deal too much damage. **** **Natascha** *Level 1 Minigun* ~~**On hit: Enemies are marked for death**~~ ~~**Increased knockback against players**~~ ~~**+40% faster spin up and spin down time**~~ ~~**+30% faster holster speed**~~ ~~*Deals 40% less damage*~~ ~~*Does not deal increased damage on players that are marked for death*~~ The Natascha has been vastly revised here. For starters is the Marked for Death effect on enemies hit by this weapon. Though the Heavy cannot utilize the status effect with this weapon, the quick holster speed and spinning time allows him to switch to his melee or shotgun and take down his opponents - that, or have a nearby teammate do the job, making the Natascha a good support weapon. The holster speed also makes this an excellent weapon for Shotgun Hoovies, aka Fat Scouts; now they'll be able to utilize their ""primary"" much faster than normal. The large knockback against players, too, is good for area denial, while being not quite as annoying as decreased speed. This leaves, of course, the large damage penalty, making it particularly weak as a weapon but good for applying status effects to enemies for other teammates to utilize. **** **Brass Beast** *Level 10 Sentry Experience* ~~**+50% faster spin time**~~ ~~**+60% faster move speed while spun up**~~ ~~*Deals 20% less damage*~~ ~~*+20% damage vulnerability when spun up and while health is more than 50%*~~ I've always firmly believed that the best way to buff the Brass Beast is to simply change its stats. The increased spin speed and spun-up mobility makes this a quick-deploy, quick-kill tool, great for ambushing and fighting in a pinch. The damage penalty, too, should be negatable to some degree. The only major downside is the damage vulnerability while spun up with more than half of your health, though considering the user should be able to shoot and move quickly, I don't think it'll be too bad for players with good awareness. **** **Tomislav** *Level 2 Mafia Negotiation Tool* ~~**30% faster spin time**~~ ~~**20% more accurate**~~ ~~**Silent Killer: No spin-up sound**~~ ~~**""BULLET!"" meter deals full crits upon activation**~~ ~~*-66% ""BULLET!"" meter duration*~~ ~~*20% slower firing speed*~~ The Tomislav is already on-par with the main minigun, but I think it could do better. A slight increase to the spinning speed has been introduced to compete with the new Brass Beast. However, the big thing here is the full crits from the BULLET! meter. This makes it a deadly weapon in a pinch, however the reduced meter duration (2 seconds) makes this better for ambushes than anything. **** **Huo-Long Heater** *Level 4 Representation of Sino-Soviet Relations* ~~**While spun up: Creates a large ring of flames around the user, which decreases as health decreases**~~ ~~**While active: Jump height increased by 100%, producing a very short puff of flames beneath the user**~~ ~~**Upon death: User explodes, dealing explosive damage and afterburn to enemies within the explosion radius**~~ ~~*20% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*Deals 10% less damage*~~ ~~*Consumes an additional 4 ammo per second while spun up*~~ The Huo-Long Heater is now a utility tool! For one thing, the flame ring bonus is better while you have more health, providing a deterrent for enemies like Spies that wish to backstab you. For another thing, the Heavy can use the weapon to reach new heights. Additionally, if players get too close when killing the Heavy, they will receive afterburn and explosive damage. This comes at the additional cost of a slower firing speed, but as the weapon is now more utility focused than anything, that shouldn't be too much of an issue. **** **All Heavy Secondaries** ~~Heavies may now equip the Buff Banner, Battalion's Backup, and Concheror in the secondary slot.~~ ~~*Heavies do not have access to ""URAH!"" meter while backpack weapons are equipped in the secondary slot.*~~ As I said with the URAH! meter suggestion, Heavies can deal plenty of damage output and sponge up damage themselves, arguably better than Soldiers can at times. Why don't they get to have access to these weapons? Of course, to balance things out, Heavies do not have their URAH! meter with the backpacks equipped. One supportive bonus is enough as it is. **** **Family Business** *Level 1 Mafia Negotiation Tool* ~~**+33% clip size**~~ ~~**+15% faster attack speed**~~ ~~**+15% faster deploy speed**~~ ~~*Deals 15% less damage*~~ This small buff - a faster deployment speed - makes the Family Business go great with the new Natascha. Fat Scouts, rejoice! **** **All Sandviches** *Level 10 Foods* ~~**Upon tossing on the ground, walking back over the item restores health.**~~ ~~All Sandviches moved to a special, Heavy-only 4th weapon slot.~~ ~~All Sandviches recharge after 20 seconds, or after 5 seconds if used to heal another player.~~ I never understood why Valve made it so that Heavies couldn't toss forward their sandviches and walk over them to get a quicker and weaker health return - for instance, to remove afterburn, or to make for a quick escape. This needs to be fixed, period. More importantly, all Sandviches can be equipped in a special 4th slot for the Heavy, much like how Spies have access to a cloak slot, or how Engineers can access PDAs. This should be another big buff to Fat Scouts and Heavies in general. Lastly, the recharge time has been reduced overall to 20 seconds, and reduced further to 5 seconds if used to heal an ally. **** **Sandvich** *Level 2 Well-Balanced Meal* ~~Press M1 to stop and perform an eating taunt, which restores 300 health over the course of 3 seconds. This eliminates any negative status effects.~~ ~~Press M2 to toss the Sandvich on the ground, acting as a single-use medium health pack. Sandvich disappears if not used after 20 seconds.~~ Eat healthily! Using this item normally (non-tossed) eliminates any status effects on the user. **** **Dalokohs Bar** *Level 4 Poorly-Balanced Meal* ~~Press M1 to perform an eating taunt, which restores 100 health over the course of 1 second.~~ ~~Press M2 to toss a Dalokohs Bar on the ground, acting as a single-use small health pack. Dalokohs Bar disappears if not used after 10 seconds.~~ ~~User starts with two Dalokohs Bars. Consuming or tossing a Dalokohs Bar reduces the Sandvich charge by 50%. One Dalokohs Bar is available at 50% charge; two are available at 100% charge.~~ While the Dalokohs Bar is equipped, the Heavy will have access to not one, but TWO of them! These are quick-heal items for sure, which can overheal the user. The great benefit of the item comes from its multiplicity. If the user eats one, they'll still have another left for either themselves or an ally. Of course, this all comes with a reduced overall health bonus - but still, this should be more than enough to make up for the additional Dalokohs Bar's availability. **** **Buffalo Steak Sandvich** *Level 1 Seriously Valve Why Did You Nerf This* ~~Press M1 to perform an eating taunt that lasts for 2 seconds, activating the item for 20 seconds and restoring 100 health on the user, extinguishing afterburn.~~ ~~Press M2 to toss the item on the ground, acting as a single-use medium health pack. Item disappears if not used after 20 seconds.~~ ~~**Upon activation, user deals minicrit damage to enemies and moves 35% faster**~~ ~~*Upon activation, user may only use melee weapons*~~ ~~Unlisted: Speed bonus upon activation stacks with other speed bonuses~~ The Buffalo Steak Sandvich did not need a nerf. Instead, it should've been buffed right back to glory! So here's the changes it needs to get melee Hoovies back on their feet: First is the removal of the received damage penalty. The melee only penalty is a big enough penalty as it is; ranged players can simply take down the Heavy from afar if need be, and Pyros can airblast the Heavy away. The additional damage received shouldn't be there, period. Next is the unlisted merger of speed bonuses, which should go well with support buffs and melee weapon speed boosts. Lastly is the big one: health returned upon consumption, which also removes the afterburn status on the user. This should go well for Heavies who have the BSS in the field, and are having an emergency. **** **Fists** *Level 10 Semi-Decent Stock Item* ~~**+25% damage when primary ammo is empty**~~ Though the Heavy can dish out some major damage with their main weapons, they often run out of ammo quickly. Thus, this is meant to provide additional support to Heavies by making them stronger in a pinch with their default melee weapon. **** **Killing Gloves of Boxing** *Level 2 Nuanced Kombat of Varied Discretion* ~~**On kill: grants 5 seconds of guaranteed critical hits for all weapons**~~ ~~**20% slower firing rate**~~ No changes here, this weapon is perfect. Please don't change this, Valve. **** **Gloves of Running Urgently** *Level 4 Nuanced Kombat of Varied Discretion* ~~**While active: +30% faster movement speed**~~ ~~*While active: User takes minicrit damage, and for 3 second after being holstered*~~ Honestly, this weapon doesn't need that many penalties. It's a good utility tool, but the damage and holster penalties just make it difficult to use with some other weapons. Hence, those penalties here have been removed, leaving only the movement speed and the minicrit reception for the user. **** **Warrior's Spirit** *Level 1 Rightly-Possessed Bear Arms* ~~**+30% damage**~~ ~~**+30 health returned on kill (may overheal user)**~~ ~~**While deployed: Lunchbox items recharge 34% faster**~~ ~~*-50 max health*~~ The Warrior's Spirit could be good, methinks, but as it stands...well, it feels a bit bad. Damage vulnerability means the user will probably take more damage while it's out, meaning any health returned from kills will be useless, giving the user a net loss of health. Thus, the weapon now serves a good utility purpose: recharging Sandviches faster while active. It also retains its health from kills, albeit it has been reduced to only 30 health (which can actually overheal the user!). Additionally, the user now starts with only 250 base health, unless the Battalion's Backup is equipped (see: secondary changes). This seems like an even trade for a weapon that helps with healing items. **** **Fists of Steel** *Level 10 Ascended Meme* ~~**While active: +50% ranged damage resistance**~~ ~~**While holstered: +25% ranged damage resistance**~~ ~~*While active: +100% melee damage vulnerability*~~ ~~*While holstered: +33% melee damage vulnerability*~~ ~~*+50% slower holster speed*~~ The Fists of Steel are great for defense at long range, however the slow switch-from speed is always something that irks me. That's the first thing to go. Additionally, the user gets a passive buff and penalty while the weapon is not deployed, to ranged damage and melee damage, respectively. This should help the user be able to avoid too much damage from Snipers. Hopefully. There is also a tiny little boost to the existing ranged damage resistance bonus, for those who didn't spot it. **** **Eviction Notice** *Level 2 Merasmus's Nightmare* ~~**+15% movement speed on user**~~ ~~**+40% firing speed**~~ ~~**On hit: gain a 3 second speed boost**~~ ~~*Deals 60% less damage*~~ The damage vulnerability on this weapon was a bit stupid. If you're gonna get close for a speed boost, that just puts you at a higher chance of getting shot and killed, right? So that's been done away with. **** **Holiday Punch** *Level 4 Lovespreading Mittens of Awestriking and Ostentation* ~~**Critical hits force victims to laugh**~~ ~~**Always crits from behind**~~ ~~**On hit: enemies wearing this item instantly laugh**~~ ~~**Crits whenever it would normally minicrit**~~ ~~*Critical hits deal no damage*~~ The game's best troll weapon, now made even better with the Buffalo Steak Sandvich. Now that the weapon gains guaranteed critical hits, users will be able to run around quickly and make all the enemies they come across fall over in heaps of joyous laughter and glee."
643,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,"[IG] ""The Knives"" &lt;Spy Melee(s)&gt;",2,4v5zue,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/4v5zue/ig_the_knives_spy_melees/,2016-07-29 20:42:52,"So, I was thinking. The Demoknight subclass is surprisingly similar to the Spy in terms of gameplay - heavily reliant on their melee weapon, in particular its critical hits, using fast movement to get into close range and deal serious damage, mostly good against single targets. However, the Demoknight has something the Spy does not - a way to quickly and reliably close in on the enemy. Arguably, this is because the Demoknight in question is usually forced to attack from the front rather than behind, but it could empower the Spy to be a whole lot more effective if this ability to charge were shared. So, an experimental little idea was born. - - - **The Butterfly Knife** *Level ? Balisong* ~~Attack enemies from behind to Backstab for a one-hit kill~~ ~~Special Attack: Charge towards your enemies, emitting a distinct sound for its duration. Gain a critical melee strike after impacting an enemy at a distance~~ So, about the 'charge' mechanic and its applications for the Spy's knives. Spy often has difficulty catching up to enemies, even with the recent movement speed buff, since it pushes him to slightly-faster-than-them speeds. There's also problems with hitboxes and backstab detection, meaning you can lose out on a kill you've been chasing down for a while because they decided to look a little too far to the left. What charging aims to do is remedy the difficulties in catching up to enemies, letting you rapidly sprint in a straight line towards them at high speed, and let you deal potentially fatal damage at the end of it (which is classified as a backstab) that isn't just an instant kill. Backstabs are still powerful one-hit kills, and you can charge at an enemy and backstab them, but the critical melee strike (dealing 120 damage) lets you deal a pretty severe amount of damage in the event that the enemy looks around wondering what that mysterious sound is. - - - **Your Eternal Reward** *Level ? Ancient Ritual Knife* ~~**Upon a successful backstab or charge kill against a human target, you rapidly disguise as your victim**~~ ~~**Silent Killer: No attack noise from backstabs, and charging is silent**~~ ~~*Wearer cannot disguise*~~ With its silent charging making up for its reduced capability in getting backstabs (because, let's be honest, not having a disguise makes you stand out like the stars at night), Your Eternal Reward now allows you to obtain kills rapidly, silently, and from out of the blue with a silent charging strike. Chasing down a target without a disguise is just begging for the nearest Pyro to show you how its homemade flamethrower works up close, so by using silent charging, you can avoid detection by moving quickly and rapidly killing enemies in a much easier fashion to obtain disguises. Hopefully this acts as a viable buff to a non-viable weapon, giving it a more stealth-oriented approach... as odd as that sounds. - - - **The Conniver's Kunai** *Level ? Misunderstood Throwing Knife* ~~**Upon a successful backstab or charge kill, you absorb the health from your victim**~~ ~~*-55 max health on wearer*~~ Almost zero change here, except that charge kills will also grant you the health boost. This is solely because charge kills apply the effects of backstabs (positive or negative), which in turn makes the Kunai more viable thanks to its new ability to rapidly deal high damage and secure a kill for that glorious health boost. - - - **The Big Earner** *Level ? Switchblade* ~~**+30% cloak on backstab or charge kill**~~ ~~**Gain a speed boost on backstab or charge kill**~~ ~~*+20% damage vulnerability while charging*~~ ~~*-25 max health on wearer*~~ The hit-and-run knife, nerfed slightly - this is, after all, an attempt at balancing just as much as it is improving. Effects only apply on backstab or charge kill, because - let's face it - no-one uses the Big Earner to facestab people, meaning you can perform the fatal combination of charging at an enemy, getting a critical melee hit, and using the speed boost or cloak on kill to get away before anyone knows what hit them. Perfect for taking out single VIP targets, but you're still very vulnerable - one close range rocket and you're dead, even less than that if you're caught while charging. - - - **The Spy-cicle** *Level ? Knife...?* ~~**Upon being hit by fire, you are fireproof for 1 second and have afterburn immunity for 3 seconds**~~ ~~**Charging provides 3 seconds of debuff immunity**~~ ~~Backstab turns victim to ice~~ ~~*Melts in fire, regenerates in 15 seconds and by picking up ammo*~~ ~~*Cannot charge while debuffed*~~ All about survivability and avoiding enemy counter-measures, the Spy-cicle protects from fire for a short time and utilises its charge more as an escape plan than an entry tool; its immunity to debuffs after a charge prevents the wielder from being tracked down very easily post-kill, but a pre-emptive move by an enemy support class can quickly render your plans ruined. You're very reliant on tactical use of your charging, knife recharge, and positioning to survive. - - - Overall, it's a major buff to the Spy; a stealth class in a not-stealth game. Hopefully this lets him be a more aggressive class, less focused on sitting in corners with the Cloak and Dagger and getting shot in the back when they pursue an enemy, more focused on actively charging after them for quick kills on single, vital targets."

Some of them are obviously better choices than the others, while some (including the stock) are at such a disadvantage that there's no real reason to use them. Here's some potential fixes for that. ----- **Fire Axe** ~~**+20% damage vs. burning players**~~ There's currently no reason to use the stock Fire Axe, since the more specific upsides of the Pyro's unlockable melees outclass it in pretty much every regard. I've given it an upside that essentially makes it the Axtinguisher Lite; it can deal reduced burst damage to burning enemies, and is still capable of dealing normal melee damage in a pinch. ----- Axtinguisher: No change. It's more balanced now that the Fire Axe is a viable alternative to it. ----- The Homewrecker is the best Pybro weapon, due to its ability to instantly remove Sappers. However, I hardly ever see Pyros using the thing, partly because its use is so limited if you're not willing to sit in an Engie nest for the whole match. The Neon Annihilator I see slightly more frequently, but almost no one uses it for its intended Pybro purpose. The changes I've made here will hopefully rectify that. **Homewrecker** ~~**+100% damage vs. buildings**~~ ~~**Damage removes Sappers**~~ ~~**Hitting friendly buildings increases their repair taken for a short time.**~~ ~~*-33% damage vs. players*~~ ~~*-20% slower firing speed*~~ (Hitting a friendly building with the Homewrecker would increase the health it receives from wrench hits or Rescue Ranger bolts by 20% for 2 seconds, without costing the Engineer who repairs it any additional metal. This effect does not stack with itself or with other Homewrecker Pyros.) **Neon Annihilator** ~~**100% crits against wet players**~~ ~~**Damage removes Sappers**~~ ~~**Speed is boosted for several seconds after removing a Sapper**~~ ~~*-20% damage penalty*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ The Neon Annihilator is now more focused on Spy-hunting, while the Homewrecker's added repair buff makes it better for long-term Engineer assistance. This would make Pybro a more diverse and viable play style. ----- **Powerjack** ~~When weapon is active:~~ ~~**Move speed increases with current number of burning players**~~ ~~(+10% for first burning player, +5% for each subsequent, up to +30%)~~ ~~**+25 health restored on burning player death**~~ ~~*Damage vulnerability increases with current number of burning players*~~ ~~(+10% for each burning player, up to +30%)~~ The Powerjack's extraordinary utility makes it one of the best Pyro melees, to the extent that it outclasses all others. To that end, I've reworked its passive upsides and downsides to become more skill-based. This probably isn't necessary, especially if the Fire Axe were made more useful, but it's a fun idea. ----- Back Scratcher: No change. It's already 100% balanced for the play style it's meant for, imo. ----- **Sharpened Volcano Fragment** ~~When weapon is active:~~ ~~**On Hit: Target is engulfed in flames**~~ ~~**Afterburn damage increased by 33% for each currently burning player.**~~ ~~*-20% damage penalty*~~ ~~Damage dealt on hit counts as fire damage.~~ Currently, the Sharpened Volcano Fragment is one of the game's most useless weapons. Its sole upside - letting you ignite enemies at point-blank - can also be accomplished by the Flamethrower, which deals more damage per second. I've added an additional upside - a buff to afterburn damage when the weapon is active, based on the number of currently burning players. (This buff would not just apply to the SVF's afterburn, but to the afterburn of the currently equipped flamethrower and/or flare gun.) I've also made the weapon deal fire damage on hit instead of melee damage, which makes the weapon synergize with the Phlogistinator a bit better. ----- **Third Degree** ~~**On Hit: Hits all players connected via Medgun beams, and reduces healing done and taken by 50% for 5 seconds**~~ ~~*You are marked for death while active, and for a short period after switching weapons*~~ The Third Degree is in the weird predicament of being a straight upgrade to stock that no one wants to use. It lacks downsides, but its sole upside is so specific and situational that you'd most likely never use it over the Axtinguisher or the Powerjack. My change to the weapon would make it a more specifically anti-Medic weapon, although its new debuff can affect any class, reducing the healing received from Mediguns, Dispensers, Sandviches, Mad Milk, self-healing weapons, and even health packs by half for a short time. (This debuff is applied to both players if it hits a Medic or their heal target through a Medigun beam.) However, the mark for death while active discourages protracted use, and encourages the user to quickly switch to the Third Degree, hit an opponent trying to heal, and quickly switch back to another weapon to finish them off.

The current 10% damage vunerability while under the effects barely makes any difference so increasing it to 25% would make it more noticeable and fair to play against. For example, say you take 90 damage. With 10% damage vulnerability, you take 99 damage, not that big of a difference. However with 20% damage vulnerability, you take a lot more damage, making it noticeable. Also, only 2 seconds of being marked for death after the effects wear off does not matter too much. Increasing it to 4 seconds may not seem like much longer, but it would make all the difference. Also, the movement speed of a scout being increased by 25% is just way too much, so it should be toned down to 15%. If these changes were implemented, I think that the Crit-a-Cola would not be overpowered and it would be a lot more fair to play against.

Having a 30% damage vulnerability with the melee weapon on heavy, the biggest and slowest target in the game, make it pretty easy to take him out. Sure the Warrior's Spirit does the most melee damage of any other melee weapons in the game, but the +50 health restored on kill just doesn't seem like enough for having 30% damage vulnerability trying to get that +50 health, and on top of that, +50 health for Heavy usually wouldn't make much difference.

After some thought, I've decided to post this thread with new reworks and concepts, as well as changes to the ideas I had previously thought of. It is highly recommended you read the previous thread before reading this one, however be careful! Both threads are extremely lengthy! **** **Effect: Wetness** ~~When applied, victim gains +25% damage resistance vs fire weapons and afterburn.~~ ~~Gained by exposure to Jarate, Sydney Sleeper, Mad Milk, Spycicle, Manmelter, or any large body of water. This effect lasts for 10 seconds.~~ Previously, I had labelled this effect as ""extinguished"", but upon reexamination, why add an entirely new effect when you can just change the way wetness works? Anywho, the principles of the earlier effect remains the same: the victim gets resistance to fire - both direct flames and afterburn - for ten seconds. However, this change makes it so that ANY exposure to weapons like Jarate and Mad Milk make victims within the weapon's radius ""wet"". While this should be good for fighting Pyros, be careful - some of them might just have a Neon Annihilator on their person! **** **Spycicle** *Level 2 Icicle* ~~**On hit by afterburn: Wearer gains fire invulnerability for 1 second, afterburn invulnerability for 5 seconds, wetness for 10 seconds, and +25% ranged damage for the duration of the effect**~~ ~~*Melts after exposure to afterburn, regenerating after 15 seconds (without ammo)*~~ ~~*-20% movement speed for 3 seconds after melting*~~ ~~*Afterburn effect remains visible on wearer while invulnerable*~~ ~~Backstabbed victims are turned into ice~~ Once again, the earlier changes remain roughly the same. The Spycicle shouldn't be a means of escape, it should be a means of -survival-. Hence, while exposed to afterburn, the wearer gains fire resistance and increased ranged damage (aka revolver damage) to fend off the attacking Pyro, but slower movement so that they can't just flee all of a sudden. Furthermore, the afterburn effect remains visible, so Dead Ringer Spies paired with the Spycicle won't be able to make such a successful escape. Speaking of which... **** **Dead Ringer** *Level 4 Invis Watch* ~~Cloak Type: Feign Death~~ ~~**+50% regen rate**~~ ~~**+40% cloak duration**~~ ~~**Upon activation: Leave a fake corpse and gain 1 second of speed, 3 seconds of afterburn invulnerability, 5 seconds of overall damage resistance, and invisibility for the duration of the cloak**~~ ~~*-50% cloak upon activation*~~ ~~*-35% cloak from ammo boxes*~~ ~~*No cloak from ammo boxes when activated*~~ ~~Cloak is activated upon taking damage~~ ~~Afterburn effect is still visible for the duration of the cloak if exposed~~ The Dead Ringer changes remain the same as the old post, except for the removal of the extinguished/wetness status. I recommend you read the older post for my reasoning for changing it. **** **All Mediguns** ~~*User and target gain increased fire and afterburn vulnerability over time while healing. Fire vulnerability is set to 25% at 10 seconds, 50% at 30 seconds, and 75% at 60 seconds. This vulnerability stops growing and lasts for 2 extra seconds on user and target once the user stops healing the target. If the user begins healing the target again before 2 seconds pass, the vulnerability will continue to increase.*~~ I've said it before and I'll say it again: the recent Pyro ""buff"" is stupid. This change is meant to do what the flamethrower change in Meet Your Match was supposed to do - counter Medics and their pockets. Medics and their pockets grow more and more vulnerable to fire damage over time - and with this new change, they stay that way for 2 seconds. This way, pockets can't just change targets all of a sudden and undo the vulnerability - they need to face consequences for a cheap tactic, after all. Overall, this should encourage Pyros to hunt down pocket Medics, and in turn should encourage Medics to stick to multiple targets, as they should be doing in the first place. **** **Effect: Afterburn** ~~Applied by flamethrowers, flare guns, and the Sharpened Volcano Fragment. Lasts for 18 seconds.~~ ~~When applied, the victim takes damage every 0.5 seconds, ""ticking"" as they do so. Damage taken from afterburn decreases over time. Damage per tick (DPT) is calculated as follows:~~ ~~4 DPT for the first 3 seconds~~ ~~3 DPT for the next 5 seconds~~ ~~2 DPT for the last 10 seconds~~ ~~The victim will receive a visual ""burning"" effect on their playermodel and from their HUD, indicating that they are on fire. This visual effect lasts for the duration of the afterburn.~~ ~~Afterburn may be removed with the ""wetness"" status.~~ Same principles as the changes in the old thread, with a few additional notes. Afterburn has never been a particularly lethal status effect, unless the victim is already seriously wounded. As it stands, it only does a pathetic 60 damage - that's not even half the HP of the weakest classes in the game! Rather, afterburn's strength relies on its ability to make enemies panic. Players who are aware of the weak damage from afterburn will more than likely just ignore it and continue doing what they're doing, however, thus nullifying afterburn as a psychological tactic. So here, I've chosen to change the way afterburn does damage. Firstly, the overall damage has been increased from 60 to 94 - still not enough to oneshot a weak class, but certainly enough to scare opponents, especially ones that are already weakened. Next, afterburn applies more damage initially, which should be enough to terrify opponents into running away for health packs. One change that I've included in this thread is that afterburn now has a visual effect on the target's HUD, much like Jarate. This should serve to further afterburn as a psychological tool, causing confusion and panic among victims who cannot properly see. **** **Flamethrower** *Level 1 Flamethrower* ~~Sprays fire out of the nozzle, igniting enemies exposed to flames and causing afterburn.~~ ~~Pressing M2 causes the weapon to ""airblast"", reflecting projectiles, knocking back enemies, and extinguishing teammates with afterburn.~~ ~~Gain 25 HP back from extinguishing allies. Wearer may overheal this way.~~ ~~Unlisted: Flamethrower damage applied through hitbox ""cones"" that grow to full range after 1 second.~~ Firstly, the health bonus from airblasting teammates feels a bit...well, weak. As it stands, the health returned doesn't overheal the user, making it a bit of a waste to extinguish players while your health is already full. So why shouldn't the user be able to overheal, huh? It'd encourage more extinguishing, which is now completely mutual between teammates. There's only one change here from the design in the old thread: now, flamethrowers apply fire not with hitboxes, but instead hitscan ""cones"". This way, players with better ping don't have further flamethrower range. Furthermore, these hitscan cones take 1 second to grow to full range, so that you can't just ignite enemies from mid-range instantly. This is meant to make the weapon more skill-based - or at the very least, ambush-oriented - while not detracting from it's original function. **** **Degreaser** *Level 10 Flamethrower* ~~**+45% holster and deploy speed for all weapons on wearer**~~ ~~**+150% growth speed of flames**~~ ~~*-10% direct damage*~~ ~~*Afterburn applied by wearer deals -1 DPT*~~ ~~*-40% less health from extinguishing allies*~~ There's a fact we need to face about the Degreaser, something that I believe a lot of people are afraid to say: it's a puff-n-sting tool. That's what it is, and that's what it will always be. The Degreaser works best as a utility for quickly igniting enemies and switching to another weapon to finish them off, be it with the Axtinguisher, the Flare Gun, or - dare I say its name - the Reserve Shooter. Like it or not, that's how the Degreaser works, and how it -should- work. However, the latest changes to it have changed the Degreaser for the worse, I think. Instead of being a good utility tool that transforms secondaries and melees into primaries, it's just a really, really, REALLY bad primary weapon. This isn't at all how the Degreaser should function, and thus these changes I've made are meant to combat that. So first and foremost, thanks to a suggestion by one Mr. Patrick333, the weapon now regains its old passive switch speed - though of course, it's nowhere near as quick as the original Degreaser was, so as to not make this weapon too OP. Why Valve ever thought to make the deployment speed to a bad primary faster than the holster speed to secondaries and melees, I'll never understand. :S Next up is the flame growth. Forgive me if I didn't word this correctly, but allow me to explain. Above, I mentioned that flamethrowers now use hitscan cones that grow over the course of 1 second. Well, the Degreaser, instead, takes much less time to reach its full range, reflecting the ""puff"" part of the Degreaser as a ""puff-n-sting"" tool. This should help users ignite enemies quickly so that they can use their Axtinguishers or Flare Guns on victims. The downsides remain the same as the ones in the old thread - less direct damage, as well as reduced health from extinguishing allies. However, I feel the DPT needs to be explained more in-depth. Now, any afterburn applied by the user - be it with the Degreaser, a flare gun, or the SVF - deals 1 less damage per tick. Afterburn is hence calculated as follows: 3 DPT for the first 3 seconds 2 DPT for the next 5 seconds 1 DPT for the last 10 seconds Overall, this means the total damage from afterburn should be 58 - that's far, far less than the new 94 damage from a normal flamethrower. This is a massive change that should keep the weapon from being overpowered; after all, you're trading off the good damage of a normal flamethrower for the quick switch and range of the Degreaser. **** **Backburner** *Level 10 Flamethrower* ~~**+100% critical hits from behind**~~ ~~**Afterburn applied by wearer deals +1 DPT**~~ ~~*While active: wearer takes minicrit damage from behind at close range*~~ ~~*+25% airblast cost*~~ ~~*No health returned from airblasting*~~ ~~Unlisted: Backburner crit range available within 120 degrees of the target's back~~ The Backburner changes remain largely the same as those in the old thread. Now, not only does it deal crits from behind, but the user also deals major damage from afterburn. Let's calculate it: 5 DPT for the first 3 seconds 4 DPT for the next 5 seconds 3 DPT for the last 10 seconds That's a whopping 130 damage overall - enough to kill a Scout, Engineer, Spy, or Sniper! With this weapon, you'll be an absolute monster - just as the face on the nozzle should indicate. Of course, there are the downsides, in that there is still an airblast cost - however, this has been largely reduced to a 25% extra cost, leaving it with only 8 airblast uses, much like the current Degreaser. Plus, it does not return health from extinguishing allies at all, though considering you'll be out on the prowl searching to kill instead of assist your allies, this shouldn't be a terribly big nerf. The last downside has been slightly changed from the old thread. The user now takes minicrits from behind, but unlike the old thread's suggestion, this means that enemies will have to get up close and personal with a Pyro's backside in order to deal the minicrits; that way, you won't have enemies minicriting Backburner Pyros all the way across the map. **** **Phlogistinator** *Level 2 Indivisible Particle Smasher* ~~**Pressing M2 releases a belch of fire at 50% of the flamethrower's normal range, dealing 30% more damage than normal to enemies**~~ ~~**Belching deals knockback to user**~~ ~~**Dealing damage with this weapon builds an ""MMPH!"" meter; when full, press Reload to perform a brief taunt that grants invulnerability for its duration, and then receive increased speed, damage, and health regeneration until the meter runs out**~~ ~~**+50% growth speed of flames**~~ ~~*+25% slower holster speed*~~ ~~*+50% more time between belches*~~ ~~*+50% belch cost*~~ ~~*Belches cannot reflect projectiles nor deal knockback to enemies*~~ The Phlog changes remain largely the same as the ones in the old thread as well, however now the MMPH bonus makes the user heal over time, and has replaced minicrits with a simple damage bonus. The most notable change would have to be the introduction of a new function, namely the ""belch"". This airblast replacement doesn't reflect projectiles or knock enemies backwards, but instead ""belches"" flames forward for more damage and for knockback on the user - think of it like a Force-of-Nature for the Pyro, without the annoyance of enemy knockback. Of course, it takes longer to repeatedly belch, as well as costs more ammo on the weapon, so the belches shouldn't be too detrimental for enemies. Furthermore, the user can have their flames reach their full extent faster than normal, which should be good for dealing damage and building up that MMPH meter. There's also an additional penalty for switching to another weapon, namely a slower holster speed. This should play well into the nature of the Phlog as the accursed W+M1 weapon. **** **New Weapon: Gasoline Giver** *Level 4 Gardening Tool* ~~**Airblasting produces a puff of steam that applies wetness to teammates and allies**~~ ~~**Enemies made wet by this weapon receive 100% crits from fire damage**~~ ~~**On hit: extinguishes burning allies**~~ ~~*On hit: extinguishes burning enemies*~~ ~~*50% damage penalty*~~ ~~Applies wetness to enemies instead of afterburn~~ ~~Fire just not doing the trick anymore? Try this garden hose! Douse your enemies with gasoline and ignite them to watch 'em burn!~~ A new weapon concept not included in the old post. With the approach of the Pyro's class update, I thought it appropriate to include a weapon concept here...just in case Valve actually checks this subreddit...which I don't think they do.... Anywho! This hose sprays gasoline instead of fire, applying wetness instead of afterburn. Hit 'em with a flare gun or the SVF to deal massive damage! Additionally, protect your teammates from fire with the ""steamblast"". The penalties here are reduced damage - why would liquid do anything directly to enemies, after all? - as well as the lack of afterburn. Not to mention, while the weapon can extinguish allies, it also extinguishes enemies as well. Still, these tradeoffs are pretty fair for a new utility weapon, especially one that makes the Neon Annihilator useful outside of the sewers of 2Fort! **** **Flare Gun** *Level 1 Weapon That Valve Shouldn't Change At All* ~~**LEAVE IT ALONE VALVE**~~ ~~*LEAVE IT ALONE VALVE*~~ ~~SERIOUSLY DON'T YOU DARE CHANGE THIS WEAPON~~ I think the stats speak for themselves here. **** **Detonator** *Level 10 Flare Gun* ~~**Pressing M2 while the projectile is in the air detonates it, creating a small puff of fire that ignites those caught in its radius**~~ ~~**+100% guaranteed minicrits vs burning players**~~ ~~**Deals large knockback on user**~~ ~~**Reloads automatically**~~ ~~*+34% self damage*~~ ~~*25% damage penalty*~~ Nothing changed here from the old thread, save for reduced damage to the user. Again, I feel like the Detonator still doesn't provide the right height in exchange for the damage done to the user, so either the damage penalty should be reduced or the knockback on the user should be increased. **** **Scorch Shot** *Level 2 Flare Gun* ~~**Flares deal knockback and ignite enemies within a small radius**~~ ~~**+100% minicrits and guaranteed knockback on burning players**~~ ~~**Projectiles can destroy stickies**~~ ~~**Projectiles that hit players fall to the ground briefly, igniting enemies that touch it**~~ ~~**Reloads automatically**~~ ~~*+20% self damage*~~ ~~*35% damage penalty*~~ Again, little is changed from the old thread, and even the current weapon, save for reduced damage to the user. The case for the Scorch Shot is the same as the Detonator - either reduce the self damage, or increase the height from flare jumps. **** **Manmelter** *Level 4 Indivisible Particle Smasher* ~~**Does not require ammo**~~ ~~**+50% projectile speed**~~ ~~**Pressing M2 extinguishes allies, earning 1 guaranteed critical hit and returning 25 HP to the user (may overheal this way)**~~ ~~**Pressing Reload consumes a stored crit for a brief speed boost**~~ ~~**Reloads automatically**~~ ~~*Does not deal additional damage vs burning players*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ This change to the Manmelter retains its crit abilities, but instead of the gradual speed bonus from extinguishing in the old thread, I've made it so that the Manmelter can consume one crit for a brief speed boost. That way, the Manmelter still provides a utility bonus - particularly in speed - while not making the Pyro too overpowered. **** **New Weapon: Swimmer's Shooter** *Level 1 Water Gun* ~~**Does not need to reload**~~ ~~**+100% critical damage vs wet enemies**~~ ~~**+50% faster fire rate**~~ ~~**+50% base ammo**~~ ~~**Contact with water refills this weapon's ammo**~~ ~~**On hit: extinguishes burning allies**~~ ~~*On hit: extinguishes burning enemies*~~ ~~*Deals 50% less damage*~~ ~~Applies wetness to enemies instead of afterburn~~ ~~Nobody's gonna mess with a man(?) crazy enough to bring a water gun to war!~~ A flare gun-esque water weapon to complement the gas hose above. Much like the Flare Gun, it crits enemies that have its effect applied to them - though the reduced damage should nullify that a tad bit. Still, the quick fire rate, plus the ability to regain ammo from bodies of water, should help balance things out with this weapon. **** **Reserve Shooter** *Level 10 Holy Shit Why Does Everybody Hate This Weapon All Of A Sudden* ~~**+75% fire rate**~~ ~~**+20% faster deploy speed**~~ ~~**Minicrits targets launched airborne by explosions**~~ ~~*-66% clip*~~ I will never for the life of me understand why this weapon was suddenly the most hated thing on Earth. Like, a month or so ago everyone just collectively lost their minds about this weapon, seemingly for no reason - like, it was always able to do minicrits to airblasted enemies, why is it suddenly a problem years after it was given to the Pyro? Anyways, the weapon has been changed around so that the airborne minicrits are no longer as big a deal. While the weapon still minicrits enemies that use explosions to jump, it no longer minicrits airblasted enemies or targets using grapple hooks (though nobody plays Mannpower anyways, it's not like anybody would notice :P). To make up for this, the weapon now fires much faster than a normal shotgun, though with the severely reduced clip this shouldn't be a huge issue. Think of it like a double-barreled shotgun. **** **Fire Axe** *Level 2 Unused Melee* ~~Deals minicrit damage vs burning enemies.~~ ~~50% of afterburn and reflect damage is returned passively as health.~~ The Fire Axe has to be one of the absolute worst weapons in the game - hell, it's one of the only weapons that LITERALLY has a direct upgrade (Third Degree) - and even the DIRECT UPGRADE is useless! Well, I want to change that. Here, the same stats from the old thread are applied. However, at the recommendation of others, the stats here aren't special for the Fire Axe alone; much like the quick swing speed of Scout's Bats and the extra damage from Heavy's Fists, the Pyro's melees should all receive these benefits in one way or another. Let me show you just what I mean.... **** **Axtingusher** *Level 4 Nerf^^TM Toy* ~~**100% guaranteed critical hits vs burning players**~~ ~~**On hit: deals 50% of remaining afterburn damage at once**~~ ~~*On hit: extinguishes enemies*~~ ~~*No health returned passively from afterburn and reflect damage*~~ ~~*-33% damage penalty*~~ ~~*25% slower holster speed*~~ Here it is. The ultimate finisher. The final frontier of melees. And the biggest goddamn nerf victim I've ever seen. The hate towards the Axtinguisher baffles me. You trade the utility capabilities of the Powerjack and the assistive abilities of the Homewrecker for a powerful offensive tool - and with the Degreaser, you turn it into your primary means of attack. It's not as easy to use as a Demoknight's sword, because then more than likely the Demoknight has a shield to protect himself with - you don't. Still, it's received hate, and as such, has been nerfed to hell - and, insultingly, this has happened MORE THAN ONCE. Well, no more, I say! I say it needs to be restored to its former glory (along with the Righteous Bison but that's a complaint for another time)! As it stands, I'm unhappy with both the Axtingusher's current stats as well as my suggestions in the old thread, so here we have something completely different. Now, the Axtinguisher has its old bonus of crits against burning players regardless of circumstance, with the added bonus that it deals the remaining afterburn damage against foes. This means it will deal the normal 135 critical damage it does now, with some additional damage left over. If pair this with the Backburner and time your shots right, you can even oneshot a Solder! But be careful - players that survive your hit will be completely free of afterburn until it gets applied again, and with the increased holster speed, you might not be able to whip out your flamethrower in time. Of course, the Degreaser should combat this, however keep in mind the reduced afterburn damage it provides! **** **Homewrecker** *Level 1 Sledgehammer* ~~**+100% damage vs buildings**~~ ~~**While active: +25% damage resistance and no knockback from sentries**~~ ~~**Damage removes Sappers**~~ ~~*-25% damage vs players*~~ ~~*No minicrits vs burning targets*~~ ~~*No passive health regen from reflect damage*~~ Nothing much changed here from the old thread. Again, it would be so much more useful if the Pyro were to use this against sentries, but half the time they can't reach the sentry to begin with before thrown back by bullets and rockets. Hence, the damage and knockback resistance vs sentries. Of course, there are now also the penalties that prevent the Pyro from getting minicrits on burning players and health from afterburn. Instead, the Homewrecker keeps the passive health regen from reflect damage, emphasizing the Homewrecker's basic role as a Pybro tool. **** **Powerjack** *Level 10 Sledgehammer* ~~**On kill: Restores 50 health (may overheal this way)**~~ ~~**While active: +15% movement speed on wearer**~~ ~~*While active: +20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ ~~*No minicrits vs burning players*~~ ~~*No passive health regen from afterburn and reflect damage*~~ ~~*No health gained from extinguishing players*~~ Once again, little is changed here from the old thread, save for the added penalties that prevent healing from reflects and afterburn, as well as preventing minicrit damage vs burning players. The Powerjack is pretty much the only decent Pyro melee right now - and even then, it kinda sucks. You can't really get that much health back from kills, and when you do, it STILL doesn't overheal you. I say, that's just ridiculous! So as a tradeoff between the old and current Powerjack, the health returned is set to 50, halfway between the old 75 HP and the current 25 HP. Not only that, but it can overheal as well! This, of course, comes with the penalty in that users who have the Powerjack equipped don't get health back from extinguishing allies at all. So if you want to get any health back, you had better whip out that melee of yours, kiddo! **** **Back Scratcher** *Level 2 Gardening Tool* ~~**+25% damage**~~ ~~**+50% health from packs**~~ ~~*-75% health from mediguns*~~ ~~*No minicrits vs burning players*~~ Initially, these changes might not seem that different. After all, excluding the lack of minicrits vs burning players, the only visible change here is that the reduced healing bonus only applies to Mediguns now, right...? Wrong! Since the Fire Axe got its passive change, so too does the Back Scratcher receive those changes! It still gets health from reflects and afterburn, and while this health isn't boosted, it's still an important change, considering the weapon was always great for offensive roamer Pyros. **** **Sharpened Volcano Fragment** *Level 4 Volcanic Fragment* ~~**On hit: target is engulfed in flames**~~ ~~**+100% damage from afterburn is returned passively on wearer**~~ ~~*-20% damage vs non-burning players*~~ ~~*No health returned passively from reflect damage*~~ ~~May perform the Armageddon taunt~~ Similar to the changes in the old thread, the SVF is now a godsend of a weapon - talk about going from zero to hero overnight! The health gained from afterburn is doubled from the base Fire Axe bonus, meaning if you pair this right, you could very well get 130 health back from a single target! Not only that, but it retains the minicrit damage against burning players, making this good in tricky situations. Add to that the fact that the damage penalty now only applies to non-burning players, and this weapon should do really well. **** **Third Degree** *Level 1 Direct Upgrade, I Mean Indivisible Particle Smasher* ~~**On hit: players connected by mediguns take the same damage as the target**~~ ~~**On hit: overheal health is transfered to the wearer (may overheal this way)**~~ ~~*Cannot overheal otherwise*~~ ~~*-25% damage vs non-healing players*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~Unlisted: Damage against players connected by mediguns counts as non-afterburn fire damage~~ Why does the Third Degree exist. It's just...it's so bad, yet somehow it's a literal upgrade from stock...it just makes no sense! I wasn't too happy with my suggestions for the Third Degree in the old thread after the fact, so now we have this suggestion instead. While the Third Degree keeps the basic stats of the Fire Axe, it also does damage against players being healed by Medics, as well as the Medics themselves. The user then robs the target of its overheal, keeping them alive just a bit longer to damage their target. Most importantly, the Third Degree's damage counts as fire, which should significantly injure pockets. Of course, this would still be a direct upgrade if I didn't include some penalties, right? Well, now the weapon deals less damage against non-healing players, and lacks random crits to make damage with the weapon consistent. The big penalty, though, is the inability for the user to overheal without stealing it from a target, so be careful! **** **Neon Annihilator** *Level 10 Electric Sign* ~~**+100% guaranteed critical hits vs wet players**~~ ~~**Damage removes Sappers**~~ ~~**While active: +100% movement speed while swimming**~~ ~~**While active: wearer is considered wet**~~ ~~*-25% damage*~~ ~~*No minicrits vs burning players*~~ ~~*No passive health regen from afterburn damage*~~ With the changes in the wetness status, as well as the inclusion of the gas hose and water gun, the Neon Annihilator should now see much more use outside of places like 2Fort. This is the most important change to the weapon, as it frankly is really underused. Other changes here include faster movement underwater (Pyrosharks need some love too :P), lack of burning minicrits and passive health from afterburn (the weapon revolves around water, so it makes sense), and wetness applied while the weapon is active (both as a passive buff for Pyros and as a humorous way to have little 1-on-1 duels between Neon Annihilator Pyros outside of the 2Fort sewers). **** And that's that! Those are all the changes, updated today. If you've made it all the way down here, congratulations! You don't have the attention span of a goldfish! Let me know what you think about these suggestions! Comments and criticisms are welcome. :)"

That idea I think should be scrapped and it should be changed to something similar to what I have listed above. When you are holding out the weapon, 1/2 of the damage you take is returned to you as berCharge. However, the health penalty on the Medic is not really fair, so it is replaced with a damage vulnerability. It would be a risk and reward weapon if the stats were changed to something similar to the ones above.

But y'know what? I don't care, I want to share some ideas god damnit! Bear in mind, this is probably gonna be a lengthy post, so if you have no attention span whatsoever, you might wish to leave while you still can. The purpose of this post is to expand upon the utility options of each class's melee weapon. My primary aim is to make sure that each stock weapon gets the best upgrade; however, I will, for the most part, distribute some of the stock bonuses to the other melee weapons in the class as I see fit. **** **Bat** *Level 2 Sports Equipment* ~~Hitting enemies with this weapon grants the user increased speed; each hit stacks for a maximum of +50% speed.~~ ~~Dealing damage with any weapon builds a meter which when activated allows the user to triple jump for 20 seconds while the Bat is deployed.~~ Basically, this gives the Scout good reason to run up and start whacking tougher enemies in the head. Plus, the third jump ability makes for good maneuverability on a class that can definitely make use of such a move. Of course, we need to take other weapons into consideration as well: **Sandman, Wrap Assassin, Boston Basher, Fan O'War** ~~*No speed boost from melee hits.*~~ **Atomizer, Candy Cane, Sun-on-a-Stick** ~~*No jump meter.*~~ The Sandman, Boston Basher, Wrap Assassin, and Fan O'War are not weapons you want to repeatedly hit enemies in the face with. Meanwhile, the Atomizer already has an immediate triple jump bonus (for a cost of health), and the other two tend to be Scout's melee weapons used most often for direct damage, so the speed boost would be more fitting for them. **** **Shovel** *Level 4 Military Equipment* ~~Damage done with any weapon increases melee range for a maximum of +60% range.~~ ~~Upon killing an enemy with this weapon, gain one free critical hit.~~ ~~Critical damage and kills do not build range nor do they provide a free critical hit.~~ Soldier's melees could always use a little more range, especially the Market Gardener. Hence, an active Soldier will be able to make his Shovel more effective when he needs to use it. As an added bonus, the extra crit should be very useful in desperate situations, or just when the player decides to go crazy and ""have a little fun"". Thankfully, these bonuses are not aided by critical hits, as that would not only create a chain of melee crits with the Shovel but would also make things very easy for a Soldier to get the full additional melee range. As for the other weapons: **Equalizer, Disciplinary Action, Half-Zatoichi** ~~*No range bonus from damage.*~~ **Escape Plan, Market Gardener** ~~*No guaranteed crits from melee kills.*~~ The Equalizer and Half-Zatoichi would benefit far more from the crit bonus as opposed to the range bonus, whereas the Disciplinary Action already has increased range. Meanwhile, the Escape Plan should be for...well, escaping, and extra range would be a nice way of reminding enemies who get too close to stay back. The Market Gardener should obviously not get guaranteed crits outside of rocket jumping. **** **Fire Axe** *Level 1 Unused Weapon* ~~Gain 2 seconds of guaranteed crits upon deployment, followed by 4 seconds of guaranteed non-crits.~~ ~~While this weapon is equipped (but not necessarily deployed), damage dealt to enemies from afterburn and reflecting are returned as health. Health gained from afterburn is equal to 100% of the damage dealt; for reflects, 50%.~~ Talk about going from zero to bloody friggin' hero! The guaranteed crits should accentuate the role of a Pyro's melee as a finisher, as well as the overall playstyle of the class as combo attacks. Furthermore, the health gained back from afterburn and reflects makes this weapon a great utility item, no matter what the circumstance. And the other Pyro melees: **Axtinguisher, Homewrecker, Powerjack, Sharpened Volcano Fragment, Neon Annihilator** ~~*No deployment crit bonus.*~~ **Homewrecker, Back Scratcher, Third Degree, Neon Annihilator** ~~*No health from dealing afterburn damage.*~~ **Axtinguisher, Powerjack, Back Scratcher, Sharpened Volcano Fragment, Third Degree** ~~*No health from dealing reflect damage.*~~ The guaranteed crits would serve the Fire Axe, the Back Scratcher, and the Third Degree best; as such, the others don't need them. Furthermore, the split of health from afterburn and health from reflects should be mostly obvious, though I should probably explain the Homewrecker and the Powerjack. The Homewrecker will see most use alongside Engineers; as such, a good Pybro will always be looking to reflect rockets and stickies from the area. Meanwhile, the Powerjack currently works best as a utility for speed; it's lack of damage penalty means it doesn't need the guaranteed crits, and the encouragement of a quick, aggressive playstyle means the player will likely rush in and dish out more afterburn damage than reflect damage. Before we move on, I'd like to take a much closer look at the Sharpened Volcano Fragment, and how one of the most useless weapons can be restructured for better usage in conjunction with my proposed changes. **Sharpened Volcano Fragment** *Level 10 Unused Weapon* ~~**On hit: target is engulfed in flames.**~~ ~~**+100% health returned from dealing afterburn damage.**~~ ~~*No health from reflect damage.*~~ ~~*No deployment crit bonus.*~~ ~~*-20% damage penalty.*~~ The SVF is now heavily specialized around afterburns and the resulting healing factor it provides. This makes it differentiated from the Fire Axe, which will serve as a sort of jack-of-all-trades utility weapon. **** **Bottle** *Level 2 Prohibitionist's Nightmare* ~~Damage dealt with any weapon increases this weapon's melee range for a maximum of 40%.~~ ~~After the first successful hit, this weapon gains a permanent +30% damage bonus that is reset upon death.~~ Demoman's stock melee really, really needs to see some use - hence, the extra range. The damage bonus also gives Valve the opportunity to actually make the Bottle's broken model to do something special. **Eyelander, Scotsman's Skullcutter, Half-Zatoichi, Claidheamh Mor, Persian Persuader** ~~*No additional range bonus.*~~ **Ullapool Caber, Eyelander, Half-Zatoichi, Persian Persuader** ~~*No damage bonus from the first hit.*~~ The extra range should be obvious for the swords. The extra damage, meanwhile, shouldn't be given to plenty of these weapons, particularly the Ullapool Caber which is mostly a oneshot weapon anyways (which itself needs to be buffed badly, but that's a different story for another time). I'd also like to take a moment here to make note of the Pain Train, one of the few multi-class melee weapons. **Pain Train** *Level 1 Splinter Material* ~~**+1 capture rate on user**~~ ~~**Gains both 30% damage after first use and a free guaranteed crit upon a kill, regardless of class.**~~ ~~*No additional range.*~~ ~~*+10% bullet vulnerability on user.*~~ This takes an essentially unused laughable weapon and makes it a special snowflake, providing the Soldier one of Demo's bonuses, and vice versa. This is of course, in place of increased melee range from damage - but I think this is a fair tradeoff. **** **Fists** *Level 1 Means of Concussion* ~~When either Primary or Secondary ammunition runs out, this weapon gains a +30% damage bonus that lasts until ammo is found.~~ ~~When BOTH Primary and Secondary ammunition runs out, this weapon deals minicrit damage to enemies. (User must have two weapons that require ammunition; sandviches do not count). This bonus lasts until ammunition is found.~~ ~~Damage taken builds up a rage bar accessible only while this weapon is deployed. When filled, the user can press M2 to charge forward, dealing one melee hit of minicrit damage and knockback to an enemy they collide with. This charge is 75% slower than a Demoman's charge.~~ Firstly comes the damage bonus. The Heavy will more often than not run out of ammunition quickly with his minigun, hence why he might have to resort to melee - and now that he has a bonus when Primary or Secondary ammo runs short, melee usage should be all the more viable at the moment. Furthermore, if he chooses to go with a secondary and runs out of that as well, he gets another bonus in the form of minicrits, BUT ONLY if the secondary he is carrying has ammo - so no abusing sandviches for you! And then comes the big change: the charge ability. The Heavy is a giant sponge on the battlefield, soaking up damage like the giant blob of meat he is (sorry Heavy, it's true). This means that, unlike the Demoman who can instantly charge whenever he chooses, the Heavy must endure the damage of opponents to get his charge ability, which is much more limited but can be all the more confusing. It helps give the game's mascot a secondary function like most, if not all, the other classes have developed up to this point. **Killing Gloves of Boxing, Fists of Steel, Eviction Notice, Gloves of Running Urgently, Holiday Punch** ~~*No damage bonus from empty ammunition.*~~ None of the above weapons have any reason to get extra damage. The KGB would be made OP; the Fists of Steel should be used for defense, not offense; the Eviction Notice needs less damage so that the Heavy can build up speed; the Gloves of Running Urgently are for running to or from a battle, not partaking in it; and the Holiday Punch is...well, the Holiday Punch. But I'll get to that weapon in a moment. **Warrior's Spirit, Eviction Notice** ~~*No rage meter for charging.*~~ These two weapons, as well, shouldn't be for running forward. The Warrior's Spirit would benefit more from the ""last stand"" empty ammo bonus, and the Eviction Notice, again, is for increasing mobility, instead of leaping at an opponent. **Killing Gloves of Boxing, Fists of Steel** ~~*50% more damage needed to activate rage meter.*~~ The Fists of Steel are already soaking up damage; to leave the amount needed to charge the same would make them clearly better at the charge than the stock Fists, and as I said, I intend to make the stock relevant goddamnit! As for the KGB, again, I don't want to make them too OP. But let's not be too unfair on them.... **Killing Gloves of Boxing** ~~**Deals crit damage from charging forward.**~~ To fit the theme of gaining crits, the KGB provides a stronger charge forward, once you manage to build the rage bar up properly. **Holiday Punch** *Level 10 Elfish Trolling Kit* ~~**Critical hits cause victim to laugh**~~ ~~**Guaranteed critical hits from behind**~~ ~~**On hit: enemies wearing this item will laugh**~~ ~~**Crits whenever it would normally minicrit**~~ ~~*Crits do no damage*~~ Did you catch that? This slight change - critting whenever it would normally minicrit - means that not only does the charge effect cause enemies to laugh, but that this weapon now works much better with the Buffalo Steak Sandvich. Now your enemies will be roaring with laughter! :D **** **Wrench** *Level 2 Incorrect Construction Tool* ~~Upon removing a Sapper, gain a small health boost (equal to a small health pack) and 100 metal and ammunition (metal gets priority).~~ ~~Gain one free critical hit (melee only) upon upgrading a non-Sentry building to level 3.~~ The Wrench is actually one of the few stock weapons that isn't that bad; however, I feel that with the recent buff of the Jag - which as an Engie main I love to friggin' death - the Wrench could use a bit of an upgrade as well. Hence, these small bonuses! The sapper removal bonus encourages Engineers to keep watch over their buildings, and rewards them for acting quickly. In contrast, for an Engineer who aims to help his team out, he will get a free crit to smack a Spy to death with. **Jag, Southern Hospitality** ~~*No bonus from removing sappers.*~~ **Gunslinger, Eureka Effect** ~~*No bonus from upgrading buildings.*~~ The Jag is good for upgrading buildings quickly; the Southern Hospitality just needed to be grouped in to either stat buff. Meanwhile, both the Gunslinger and the Eureka Effect will have less of a focus on upgrading buildings, and hence they get a bonus for sapper removal. **** **Bonesaw** *Level 4 Back Alley Surgical Tool* ~~Enemies hit by this weapon bleed for 5 seconds.~~ ~~Allies hit by this weapon receive a small health boost (equal to a small health pack) and gain a 10% speed boost for 10 seconds. This bonus can only be applied once every 30 seconds.~~ The Bonesaw now has a better function for both Spychecking, self defense, and teammate assistance! **Ubersaw, Vitasaw** ~~*Does not cause bleeding.*~~ **Ubersaw, Amputator, Solemn Vow** ~~*Cannot provide bonus to allies upon hit.*~~ The Ubersaw is already good as it is, and thus it doesn't need any of the boosts. Meanwhile, the other weapons are given stats out of obviousness; the Amputator and Solemn Vow, as a surgical saw and blunt object respectively, would cause bleeding in real life, whereas the Vitasaw seems like it should be able to inject a substance into other players. **** **Kukri** *Level 1 Bane of Spies* ~~Upon landing a headshot, gain one free critical hit (melee only).~~ A small bonus that reflects the nature of the class. The oddity here is that, out of all the suggestions, this is the only weapon where the added stats do not get given to other weapons. Honestly, I feel that the Sniper's melees, of all things, are pretty solid, and that the Kukri alone should get this bonus, since it is the most often used. **** **Knife** *Level 10 Bane of Snipers, Heavies, and anyone with a low ping* ~~This weapon can backstab. That's good enough of a bonus.~~ Yeah, honestly the Knives have the backstab gimmick, so I don't think anything needs to be added here either. **** **Other Mechanics** ~~Bleeding now causes enemies to take 10 damage if attack with their melee.~~ Just a little something-something to differentiate bleeding from afterburn. **** So yeah, that was a pretty wild ride, writing up this whole list of possibilities. Again, I doubt any of this will make it into the next update - but hey, it's always good to speculate and suggest stuff, right?"

Note: A sticky bomb's... or nade's? radius is 146hu. **The Drunken Bomb** ~~Replaces your secondary with a keg of TNT~~ ~~**On death: Explode dealing ~125 blast dmg in a 146 unit radius**~~ ~~*Does not proc if killed by melee*~~ ~~*50% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ ~~*-20% slower move speed on wearer*~~ My main problem with this one is pairing it with the Loose Cannon and/or Caber, which can give almost instakills if done right. I was considering doing something like, the keg gains damage as you take damage from enemies, but not if you take fall/self damage. This gained damage would be what affects the base blast damage, so you can't just caber/cannon with it. It still maxes at 125. So it basically works the same if you are being killed by the enemy, but not if you're trying to suicide. The idea is to try and get a last laugh if you're about to die or pressure the enemy to be careful in how and when they actually kill you. **The Giant Sticky Bomb** ~~Wear an MvM payload on your back that can be activated at any time~~ ~~**Alt-Fire: Start a 5.5s timer to detonate the payload, killing yourself with a ~225 dmg blast in a 242 unit radius**~~ ~~*Has a loud activation and ticking sound*~~ ~~*Become scare-stunned after the timer starts*~~ ~~*Deactivates if you get killed early*~~ See the video I'm basing it off of: URL This one is something I might consider adding slight damage resistances to after play-testing it if it turns out to be too useless cause of the noise.

The operative word here being ""Tweaks""; the FoS currently is decent, but is still missing some features that would aid its use as a tanking device, such as knockback resistance. The damage resistance goes from 500(750) HPe to 400(600) HPe, to compensate for his being an immovable behemoth. Thanks to lack of knockback while active, Heavy can contest points and distract Sentries while the rest of his team moves in behind him. Melee weapons can still crit and/or knock around FoS Heavy, though, and with only 200(300) HPe vs. melee combined with slow movement and punches, Heavy's all but defenseless in close quarters. Edit 1: A concern brought up in a comment is that crit immunity would remove Sniper as a Heavy counter. Reduced crit immunity from ranged sources to 67% crit resistance. A fully charged Sniper headshot is 450 damage (150 from the fully charged shot, plus 300 critical damage), which is now 213 damage-effective against this hypothetical Heavy (113 after the 25% ranged damage resistance, plus 100 critical damage after the crit resistance). Snipers can take down this hypothetical Heavy in two headshots, or at least severely reduce his ability to soak up that Soldier's rockets. Edit 2: I ended up scrapping the crit resistance altogether, and made the knockback immunity vs. ranged damage only. Also added the bonus heal while active and heal penalty while inactive."

This will mostly focus on direct Pyro changes, however there will be a few non-Pyro changes here and there to help work around some issues with the class. **** **New Effect: Extinguished** ~~While under the effects, +25% afterburn and fire resistance. User is considered wet for the duration of the effect.~~ ~~Gained by extinguishing flames with Jarate, Mad Milk, Sydney Sleeper, Spycicle, Dead Ringer, Manmelter, or any body of water. This effect lasts for 10 seconds.~~ With this new effect, it becomes much easier for a player to fight fire with non-fire. The additional ""wet"" effect will also make the Neon Annihilator much more viable outside of the 2Fort sewers, so be wary! **** **Spycicle** *Level 2 Icicle* ~~**On hit by fire: Fire invulnerability for 2 seconds, Afterburn invulnerability for 7 seconds, and +25% Revolver damage**~~ ~~**Gains ""Extinguished"" status for 10 seconds**~~ ~~*Melts in fire, regenerating after a maximum of 15 seconds (without ammo)*~~ ~~*-15% movement speed for 3 seconds after melting*~~ ~~Victims are turned into ice~~ ~~Afterburn effect is still visible while invulnerable~~ **Dead Ringer** *Level 4 Invis Watch* ~~Cloak Type: Feign Death~~ ~~**+50% regen rate**~~ ~~**+40% cloak duration**~~ ~~**Upon activation: Leave a fake corpse and gain 1 second of speed, 3 seconds of afterburn invulnerability, 5 seconds of overall damage resistence, 10 seconds of ""Extinguished"" status, and invisibility for the duration of the cloak**~~ ~~*-50% cloak meter when activated*~~ ~~*-35% cloak from ammo boxes*~~ ~~*No cloak from ammo boxes when activated*~~ ~~Cloak is activated upon receiving damage~~ ~~After 2 seconds of activation, afterburn effect becomes visible if ignited while invulnerable~~ With the recent update, Spychecking has become next to impossible. The damage negation of the weapons was fine, however the Pyro's inability to catch up with and set on fire a Spy made it so that even an unskilled player could get away after a failed backstab unscathed, and return to try again later. The above changes should help counteract this. He should now be visible if ignited, even with the Extinguished status that both items provide. Each weapon also has individual changes. For the Spycicle, the Spy is now encouraged to stick around and fight with his revolver instead of running away giddily. The Dead Ringer still serves much of its original purpose, however players should be careful around Pyros as they will gain a visual afterburn effect if they don't get away in time. **** **All Mediguns** ~~*User and target gain increased fire vulnerability after healing a single target over time. 25% vulnerability at 10 seconds, 50% at 30 seconds, and 66% at 60 seconds.*~~ Instead of the recent ""buff"" to the Pyro's primaries, I believe this would be a much better means of deterring pocketing and instead encourage Medics to heal other teammates. **** **Effect: Afterburn** ~~Applied by flamethrowers, flare weapons, and the Sharpened Volcano Fragment. Lasts for 18 seconds. During this time, the target takes damage every 0.5 seconds; this damage decreases over time. Damage is calculated as follows:~~ ~~4 damage per tick for the first 3 seconds~~ ~~3 damage per tick for the next 5 seconds~~ ~~2 damage per tick for the last 10 seconds~~ ~~While under the effects, target receives a visual ""fire"" effect that lasts for the duration.~~ There are a few things to go over about these changes to afterburn: * Total base damage is increased from 60 to 94. This may seem like much, but it shouldn't be enough to immediately kill low-health classes, plus if you can survive the initial damage you should be fine for a while. * The increased damage taken in the first few seconds should be enough to make enemies panic, especially those that are already injured. **** **All Pyro Primaries** ~~Extinguishing players with airblast returns 25 health to the user. This may overheal the user.~~ First and foremost: the bonus added in MYM has been removed, as the Medigun changes indicated. It was essentially pointless and encouraged little more than charging in blindly at a pocket, dealing next to no damage in the process. Next, airblast extinguishing can overheal the user. Just a little thing that should have been included in the first place. **** **Degreaser** *Level 1 Flamethrower* ~~**+45% holster speed**~~ ~~**+25% deploy speed**~~ ~~*-10% damage*~~ ~~*While active: -1 damage from afterburn ticks*~~ ~~*-40% health from extinguishing with airblast*~~ The Degreaser, as a utility tool, should be strictly reserved for switching between weapons. I think Valve missed the memo on this, as the last changes made to the weapon turned it into a really bad primary, with the switch effects made so that switching -to- the Degreaser was faster than switching -away- from it. Now, the Degreaser has a proper holster bonus for other items, and keeps a small deploy bonus for itself. It's nowhere as quick as before, but that should help to keep it from being too overpowered. As for the negative stats, the Degreaser won't be doing much in terms of direct offense. The old -10% damage stat is back to help deter W+M1 usage of the weapon. More importantly, however, is the -1 damage per tick on afterburn, which should require a bit more of an in-depth explanation. Instead of 4 damage per tick for 3 seconds, 3 DPT for 5 seconds, and 2 DPT for 10 seconds, Degreaser users deal only 3 DPT for 3 seconds, 2 DPT for 5 seconds, and 1 DPT for 10 seconds. This means that the total afterburn damage for a Degreaser user is 58, a staggering drop from the 94 damage of a regular user. It should be noted, however, that this applies only while the Degreaser is active, so switching to a different weapon should deal regular afterburn. This ties into the nature of the Degreaser as a switch tool. Lastly comes the negated health bonus from airblasting to replace the slight decrease in available airblasts. If the Degreaser is going to be a utility tool, it should be able to have as many airblasts as a Pyro normally has. To compensate, it receives less health from extinguishing teammates. **** **Backburner** *Level 10 Flamethrower* ~~**+100% critical hits from behind**~~ ~~**While active: +1 damage from afterburn ticks**~~ ~~*While active: Receive minicrits from behind*~~ ~~*-25% airblast*~~ ~~*No health from airblasting*~~ The Backburner retains its signature backside crits, remaining a very useful flanking tool. More importantly, it gains an increased damage per tick from afterburn (5 DPT for 3 secs, 4 DPT for 5 secs, 3 DPT for 10 secs) for a grand total of 130 afterburn damage - enough to kill some classes at full health, making this weapon a complete monster. Meanwhile, the user gains vulnerability from behind to minicrits, giving a bit of an ironic twist to the weapon's nature. Furthermore, while the airblast cost has been negated for the most part, the user does not gain any health at all from airblasting - instead, they'll want to focus on offense with this weapon. **** **Phlogistinator** *Level 2 Particle Smasher* ~~**Airblasting produces a large ""belch"" of flames that deal 30% more damage to enemies caught in them**~~ ~~**Airblasting deals knockback on the user**~~ ~~**Dealing damage builds an ""Mmph"" meter; pressing Reload while this meter is full activates a brief taunt that grants invulnerability to the user for that taunt's duration and increased speed, damage resistence, and minicrits for a few seconds afterwards**~~ ~~*+50% time between airblasts*~~ ~~*+50% airblast cost*~~ ~~*Airblast cannot reflect projectiles nor deal knockback to enemies*~~ ~~*-50% range for fire released from airblasts*~~ The lack of airblast really made this weapon suffer. As such, I have worked in a new mechanic: ""belching"", which, as the name implies, involves the user ""belching"" some powerful fire at a shorter distance. This ability can be used to help the user jump around thanks to the knockback added on it; think of how FaN Scouts utilize their weapons. The Mmph bonus, too, has been reworked to provide less of a bonus, but still keep the invulnerability from taunting. Overall, these changes should help make the Phlog less of a W+M1 weapon and a utility tool for maneuverability *a la* belching. **Flare Gun** *Level 4 Flare Gun* ~~**+100% critical hits on burning enemies**~~ ~~**Reloads automatically**~~ ~~*No knockback on user*~~ Nothing needs to be changed about this weapon (outside from fixing the projectile lag). Moving on. **** **Detonator** *Level 1 Flare Gun* ~~**Pressing M2 after firing the projectile detonates it in midair, creating a small explosion that ignites nearby players**~~ ~~**+100% guaranteed minicrits on burning players**~~ ~~**Increased knockback on user**~~ ~~**Reloads automatically**~~ ~~*+50% self-damage*~~ ~~*-25% damage*~~ The Detonator is decent as it is, however the height from flare jumps isn't equal to the damage dealt in return. As such, increased knockback than it has now would be good compensation. **** **Scorch Shot** *Level 10 Flare Gun* ~~**Flares knock back enemies and ignites enemies in a small radius**~~ ~~**+100% minicrits and guaranteed knockback on burning targets**~~ ~~**Projectiles can destroy stickies**~~ ~~**Projectiles fall to the ground briefly, igniting enemies that touch it**~~ ~~*-35% damage penalty*~~ ~~*-35% self-damage*~~ The Scorch Shot remains as it is, however, like the Detonator, it could use an increased knockback for the user in order to properly perform flare jumps. **** **Manmelter** *Level 2 Particle Smasher* ~~**Does not require ammo**~~ ~~**+50% projectile speed**~~ ~~**May press M2 to extinguish allies, applying the ""Extinguished"" effect to the target and the user**~~ ~~**+5% movement speed for every target extinguished in any way, for a maximum of +30%**~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~Speed bonus from extinguishes only applies while this weapon is active~~ As the Flare Gun is already far superior at gaining critical hits, the Manmelter, as such, has been repurposed to help boost the Pyro's speed. Furthermore, as with the Mmph meter for the Phlog, the Manmelter now gets its bonus built with other weapons that extinguish - chiefly, either the Pyro's primary or extinguish items reflected by the user. **** **Reserve Shooter** *Level 4 Shotgun* ~~**Minicrits targets launched airborne by explosions, grapple hooks, and enemy attacks**~~ ~~**+20% deploy speed**~~ ~~*-50% clip*~~ ~~*-50% max secondary ammo*~~ EDIT: I have only just realized that this already includes airblasts. Strange, as my latest games did -not- feature airblasted targets receiving minicrits. ... Maybe I just suck at the game. **** **Fire Axe** *Level 1 Axe* ~~**On user: 50% of damage dealt from afterburn and reflects is returned as health**~~ ~~**+100% minicrits on burning enemies**~~ The Fire Axe has to be one of the worst weapons in the base game. It's just...well, it's really really plain. There's nothing special to it. In fact, it's one of the only weapons that has a straight upgrade in the form of the Third Degree (which will be addressed in a moment). Which is why I say it should get the above benefits. The health from afterburn and reflects will make it good as a utility on users, and the minicrits on burning targets - that is, 88 damage - makes it good for offense, or at least finishing opponents, turning it into a miniature Axtinguisher. Speaking of which.... **** **Axtinguisher** *Level 10 Axe* ~~**On hit: burning targets receive damage equal to a minicrit plus 40% of the equipped primary's total afterburn damage**~~ ~~**+100% critical hits on burning players from behind**~~ ~~*-50% damage vs non-burning players*~~ ~~*+20% bullet damage vulnerability while deployed*~~ ~~*Max 10% deploy speed from other weapons*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ The new stats of the Axtinguisher may seem similar to the Gun Mettle version, but look closer and you'll find there's a pretty big difference. The base minicrit damage for the weapon is 88. This is practically worthless, even against low HP classes like Scouts and Snipers. Thus, 40% of your primary's total afterburn damage is added to hits against burning players from the front. Hence, a base attack against a burning player from the front would be 126 damage, enough to oneshot a low HP class. With the Degreaser, puff-n-sting gameplay comes back with a nice little 10% deployment bonus for the Axtinguisher (though nothing higher in order to prevent too quick of a kill). However, with the reduced afterburn for the Degreaser, the total amount of damage against a burning player with the Axtinguisher should be 111, a high amount for a finisher but not enough to oneshot a low HP class. Meanwhile, the Backburner's additional afterburn damage should grant the Axtinguisher's front bonus a total of 140 against burning players at the front, once again proving how monstrous it can be. The weapon also receives bullet vulnerability while active, in order to give some classes - i.e. Scout, Sniper, Heavy, etc. - a better chance to survive against a Pyro that doesn't swing carefully. **** **Homewrecker** *Level 2 Sledgehammer* ~~**+100% damage vs buildings**~~ ~~**-25% damage from sentries while active**~~ ~~**No knockback from sentries while active**~~ ~~**Damage removes sappers**~~ ~~*-33% damage vs players*~~ The Homewrecker is great for the Pybro, but terrible for anything else. The building bonus is great against sappers, but can't do anything against real buildings like sentries - hence, the damage resistance and lack of knockback from sentries to encourage Pyros to go and take out nests. To compensate, the damage penalty vs players has been increased to 33%. **** **Powerjack** *Level 4 Sledgehammer* ~~**On kill: restores 50 health**~~ ~~**+15% movement speed while deployed**~~ ~~*While active: +20% damage vulnerability*~~ ~~*No health from airblasting*~~ ~~Health gained from kills may overheal user~~ The Powerjack is already the best Pyro melee at the moment, and simply needs a bit of tweaks to make it the best it could possibly be. With 50 health from melee kills this makes the Pyro a daunting enemy to face in combat - not to mention, the added overheal ability from melee kills means that the user can even bolster themselves up without a Medic. In contrast, the user cannot gain health from extinguishing allies, so for HP it's gonna be a melee-only focus. **** **Back Scratcher** *Level 1 Gardening Tool* ~~**+25% damage**~~ ~~**+50% health from packs**~~ ~~**Pick up ammo packs to fill a rage meter; when full, press M2 to gain guaranteed melee crits for several seconds**~~ ~~*-50% ammo gained from ammo packs*~~ ~~*-75% health from Mediguns and Dispensers*~~ ~~*Cannot switch weapons while melee crits are active*~~ The Back Scratcher currently works best in medieval mode, or when Pyros want to roam alone. However, I think we can do better than that - hence, the melee crit function, added to give additional usage of the weapon. It should go nicely with the weapon's already increased damage bonus. **** **Sharpened Volcano Fragment** *Level 10 Volcanic Fragment* ~~**On hit: target is engulfed in flames**~~ ~~**While active: +100% damage from afterburn is returned as health**~~ ~~*-20% damage*~~ ~~May perform the Armageddon taunt~~ The SVF now does something! Much like the suggested buff to the Fire Axe, the SVF gains not just 50%, but 100% of afterburn damage dealt as health. This effect is only active while the weapon is deployed of course, but that's only a small price to pay for the benefits this could reap. As a small aside, the weapon now performs the Armageddon taunt as well, which would fit the theme of the weapon dealing fire damage. It would only be fitting for an axe that looks this cool B) **** **Third Degree** *Level 2 Particle Smasher* ~~**If target is overhealed, damage dealt will be a minicrit**~~ ~~**Damage transfers to players connected via mediguns**~~ ~~*-33% damage vs players with &lt;33% health*~~ ~~*+20% explosive vulnerability*~~ ~~Damage penalty against players with low health does not apply to players on the other end of a medibeam~~ And now the Third Degree has some downsides! Firstly, the weapon can be used to lower the health of a pocket - much more so than the recent flamethrower buff - so long as said pocket is overhealed. The damage - including the minicrits against overhealed players - can still be transfered either to the pocket or to the Medic. Users should be careful though - against players with low health, the Third Degree grows weaker, so instead a primary or secondary would be good to finish off the target. There's also added vulnerability against explosives - rockets, stickies, grenade pills - while the weapon is active. However, since the Pyro can use their primary to reflect projectiles like these, they shouldn't be too much trouble. **** **Neon Annihilator** *Level 4 Electric Sign* ~~**+100% critical hits vs wet players**~~ ~~**Damage removes Sappers**~~ ~~*-20% damage*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~Being coated in liquid applies the Extinguished effect for 10 seconds to the user~~ The Neon Annihilator, again, would get an extreme benefit from the introduction of an ""extinguished"" status, and since that's been mostly covered I won't regurgitate it here. The user now also receives the Extinguished status if they get coated with Jarate, Mad Milk, etc., making them vulnerable to another Neon Annihilator wielder. **** And that, ladies and gentlemenn, is my list of recommendations for balance changes to the Pyro, his weaponry, and his adversaries' tools. Not all need to be applied, but many would certainly benefit from the changes above. Let me know what you think! I'd love to get some feedback on these ideas."
667,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,"[IG/UP] ""Underused Weapon Changes"" &lt;Multi Class, All Slots&gt;",13,4td7po,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/4td7po/igup_underused_weapon_changes_multi_class_all/,2016-07-18 13:44:37,"The Meet Your Match update has been out for a week and a half now and some of the weapon changes have been mixed. Some people are excited that some weapon have new features, like the Shortstop shove, while others are devastated that their favorite weapon has been nerfed to hell (looking at /r/bisonmasterrace). However, I'm happy with most of the changes, though I believe not all the weapons were given their moment in the sunlight, which is why I'm making this post to try to share my ideas on how to make these weapons more fun and viable in games. Note, I'm only covering weapon that I feel could use a touch up. I'm not making a list of weapons that I think should be nerfed...yet... **The Baby Face's Blaster** *Level 10 Scattergun* ~~**On Hit: Builds Boost**~~ ~~*-34% clip size*~~ ~~*-10% jump height on wearer*~~ ~~Boost meter is contained in 4 small bars.~~ ~~Use Alt+Fire to activate Boost mode for a short speed boost.~~ The biggest problem with using the Baby Face's Blaster when it first came out was the overwhelming speed the Scout had at full boost. Because of this, Valve nerfed it harshly by giving it a lose boost when hit attribute. The tiniest amount of damage the Scout takes now brings the Boost down harshly, making it very easy to quickly lose that (not so) hard earned speed. With this change, the Baby Face's Blaster works in favor of the player while not making it too overpowered. Now your standard BFB Scout is fit enough to maneuver the same speed as the stock Scout, albeit with a small jump height penalty. Scout gains Boost the same way normally, by doing damage. However this Boost doesn't increase Scout's speed instantly. The Boost instead is charged with a meter similar to the Vaccinator. On Alt+Fire, one of the bars is used up and the Scout gets a short speed boost for a few seconds, allowing him to run away or make a push into an enemy's face. This way, the BFB can be fun for the user to use while not making him as unfun to play against while it was in its prime. **The Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol** *Level 10 Pistol* ~~When weapon is active:~~ ~~**On Hit: Gain up to +5 health**~~ ~~**+75% accuracy**~~ ~~*-25% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*-25% damage penalty*~~ While I believe that [this idea to buff the PBP is clever](URL I think that there is still one flaw which leads me away to the weapon. The clip size penalty means the Scout will only be able to heal himself for 25 health before reloading, and that's only IF all the shots hit a target. So I propose that in exchange for the damage vulnerability that we replace it with a damage penalty to ensure that the weapon is worse in picking off foes when your Scattergun has no bullets in its clip and replace the no fall damage attribute (which honestly is pretty useless now) with an accuracy bonus. Although the accuracy bonus and damage penalty may need some tweaking, it would be a good change so that Scout is healed more while the weapon is out in exchange for a smaller DPS. **The Wrap Assassin** *Level 15 Bat* ~~**Alt-Fire: Launches a festive ornament that shatters causing bleed**~~ ~~**+25% increase in recharge rate**~~ ~~*-65% damage penalty*~~ ~~(Unlisted) Bauble shatters cause bleed. Bleeding duration depends on how close the enemy was from the shatter.~~ A minor change, but a welcome one. I think when the bauble shatters it should cause bleeding depending on how close or far the enemy was from getting hit by it. As far as I've seen, the most damage the bauble can do when shattering next to an enemy is a measly 5 damage, which is pretty pathetic. **The Sun-On-A-Stick** *Level 10 RIFT Fire Mace* ~~**100% critical hit against burning players**~~ ~~**100% critical hit while on fire**~~ ~~**+25% fire damage resistance while deployed**~~ ~~*-25% damage penalty against non-burning players*~~ ~~*-10% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ The Sun-On-A-Stick is a weapon that people are a bit harsh about. While it may be one of the most situational weapons in the game, its downsides aren't worthless. However, it did perform worse than the stock bat so technically it was, and still is underpowered. So to change this I added another positive attribute that allowed the bat to perform critical hits while the Scout is burning. Note that it still has a damage penalty against players who aren't on fire in this state, so it only performs reduced damage critical hits. I also gave it normal critical damage against burning targets in order to make use of the small windows of opportunity when the Scout comes across a burning Heavy. Also removed critical hits in order to reward the crits against burning enemies bonus and gave it a slower firing speed in order to lower the DPS. **The Liberty Launcher** *Level 25 Rocket Launcher* ~~**+40% projectile speed**~~ ~~**-25% blast damage from rocket jumps**~~ ~~**+25% more vertical knockback**~~ ~~*-25% damage penalty*~~ IMO, The Liberty Launcher is a strange behemoth of a Rocket Launcher in which a bunch of stats were meshed together in order to create a Rocket Launcher that tried to do everything. Now, I love the Liberty Launcher very much, but the clip size bonus doesn't really feel like it fits with the rest of what this weapon's bonuses. Disagree with me if you wish, but I believe that replacing the clip size with this would be better. This new change allows the Liberty Launcher to knock enemies up into the air higher than the normal Rocket Launcher, which would lead to more juggling and would also give a chance for some more synergy with the Reserve Shooter. **The Mantreads** *Level 10 Boots* ~~**-75% reduction in push force taken from damage**~~ ~~**Deals 4x falling damage to the player you land on**~~ ~~**Wearer takes no fall damage if landing on a surface other than skulls**~~ Sometimes I forget these little pair of boots in my backpack even exist because its older brother, the Gunboats, takes the spotlight most of the time. So I've decided to give these things a little buff to make it a bit more viable now. By giving it a damage bonus and no fall damage if not landing on an enemy, hopefully things will change for these little troopers. **The Reserve Shooter** *Level 10 Shotgun* ~~**This weapon deploys 20% faster**~~ ~~**Mini-crits targets launched airborne by explosions, grapple hooks or enemy attacks**~~ ~~**+20% more accurate**~~ ~~*-34% clip size*~~ ~~*This weapon holsters 15% slower*~~ ~~(Unlisted) Removed Reserve Shooter from the Pyro. Instead, replaced it with the Torcher's Twinbarrel which has similar stats.~~ Ah yes, this shotgun has had some controversy over the years. The Reserve Shooter is definitely more equipped as a Pyro secondary than a Soldier secondary, which is not a good idea in my opinion because no matter how much is buffed in the Soldier's favor, it will also be better on the Pyro. The Pyro is able to knock enemies into the air more easily than Soldier because of airblast. For Soldier he needs to aim at a target's feet and knock him into the air high enough to switch to his secondary and shoot him in time before he lands. Splitting the Reserve Shooter into two separate weapons will solve this problem. This version of the Reserve Shooter has the same stats as the current one with an added accuracy bonus so he is able to deal more damage to targets. Again, this allows for more synergy with the Liberty Launcher and brings them closer together like the lovebirds they are. **The Torcher's Twinbarrel** *Level 10 Shotgun* ~~**This weapon deploys 20% faster**~~ ~~**+45% damage bonus against targets launched airborne by explosions, grapple hooks or enemy attacks**~~ ~~**+15% faster reload time**~~ ~~*-10% damage penalty*~~ ~~*-66% clip size*~~ Technically a new weapon idea, but an idea that's close enough to the Reserve Shooter that I'm just listing it under a weapon rework. The Reserve Shooter has always been controversial, but hopefully this will make the weapon less unfun to play against while still retaining its original spirit. The most major nerf to the gun is its clip size penalty in that it can only hold two shots in its clip. If the clip size is too much, then I suggest a +15% faster reload speed, a bit slower than the Soda Popper's reload speed. However, it still has all the powerful of the Reserve Shooter damage wise, but has been stripped of its mini-crits because of damage fall off, which is a pain for many players. This way, at close range, the Reserve Shooter can deal more devastating damage, while the damage is lessened the farther the Pyro is from its target. **The Sharpened Volcano Fragment** *Level 10 RIFT Fire Axe* ~~When weapon is active:~~ ~~**On Hit: target is engulfed in flames**~~ ~~**All afterburn is mini-crit boosted**~~ ~~**Twice of all fire damage dealt is returned as health**~~ ~~*-20% damage penalty*~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ ~~*This weapon deploys and holsters 20% slower*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~(Unlisted) Melee damage is classified as fire~~ While this list of attributes for such a simple weapon may look confusing, let me try to explain. While this weapon before was useless, this new iteration allows the Pyro to heal himself over time with afterburn while also increasing the damage the afterburn does, allowing her to in a sense suck the life out of its opponents with fire. However, this seems a bit too powerful and so along with the damage penalty, the SVF will have a slower deploy and holster time and a vulnerability while active, making leeching a bit harder for the Pyro as it is very risky. As for the Axtinguisher, I think it just needs to be reverted back to its past iteration. **The Scottish Resistance** *Level 5 Stickybomb Launcher* ~~**+25% faster firing speed**~~ ~~**+50% max secondary ammo on wearer**~~ ~~**+6 max pipebombs out**~~ ~~**Detonates stickybombs near the crosshair**~~ ~~**Special Attack: detonates stickybombs directly under your feet**~~ ~~**Able to destroy enemy stickybombs**~~ ~~*0.6 sec slower bomb arm time*~~ A tiny buff to fix an otherwise okay sidegrade: a quicker arm time and changing the key to detonating stickies under your feet. No more accidental detonation and you're able to get your defensive traps up more quickly! **The Ullapool Caber** *Level 10 Stick Bomb* ~~When weapon is active:~~ ~~**On hit: causes an explosion which recharges every 15 seconds**~~ ~~**Wearer never takes falling damage**~~ ~~*20% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*This weapon deploys 100% slower*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~(Unlisted) Explosions deal -25% less damage to the Demoman~~ The Caber is considered to be the worst melee weapon for Demo, and for good reason. Using it would hurt you more than it would benefit you, and its effect only works once until you touch a resupply cabinet. It used to be fun but is now a shell of its former glory... ...Until now, when damage done to you is reduced and while active you negate fall damage! That's right, now you only take 75 damage on the explosion and no fall damage while active. Now kamikazes don't leave you totally devoid of health, allowing you to survive longer. And as an added bonus, the Caber now has a recharge when used. So your last resort doesn't have to be your last use of this thing! The Claidheamh Mr falls under the same reasoning for the Axtinguisher. Its past iteration was just fine, though the sword switch and holster speed would still be implemented. **The Brass Beast** *Level 5 Minigun* ~~**+20% damage bonus**~~ ~~**-20% damage resistance**~~ ~~**On kill: +50 health**~~ ~~*50% slower spin up time*~~ ~~*-40% slower move speed while deployed*~~ Even with the Huo Long Heater buffed in this update, I still believe the Brass Beast was the worse minigun. Even though the Huo Long Heater had massive ammo depletion with the tiny upside of a ring of fire, which still could be avoided easily, the Brass Beast is unfun to play against and is strictly designed for defense. However even when defending, the stock minigun or any of Heavy's other unlocks shone more than the Brass Beast. This weapon is designed to make Heavy tanky, so its about time we made him a bit harder to handle. With this buff, the Heavy will now be able to heal himself with every kill. This way, the Heavy will be able to tank a lot more damage and be less dependent on a Medic. I also gave Heavy a bit more movement while spun up so he's not just a sitting duck. **The Buffalo Steak Sandvich** *Level 1 Lunch Box* ~~While under the effects, move speed is increased, attacks mini-crit, knockback is increased, and the player may only use melee weapons.~~ ~~Alt-fire: Share with a friend (Medium Health Kit)~~ I never understood why the Heavy needed a damage vulnerability while eating this weapon. I always thought being restricted to his melee was enough of a downside. But anyway, this weapon has been changed so that when consumed, the Heavy instead of a damage vulnerability, has increased knockback. This makes him easy to avoid, but can also provide an escape plan for the Heavy by surfing on an explosion. A change that can be both positive or negative depending on how it's used. **The Warrior's Spirit** *Level 10 Boxing Gloves* ~~When weapon is active:~~ ~~**+30% damage bonus**~~ ~~**+75 health restored on kill**~~ ~~*30% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ 50 health may mean a lot to a low health class like the Scout or Spy, but to the Heavy, it's only 1/6 of his whole health. The man's big, fat, and easy to hit, so he's going to absorb more bullets than a skinny French man. So why not increase the health the Heavy receives from the Warrior's Spirit to 75? It's an easier change and rewards Heavy with a big chunk of health which he can use to survive a bit longer. Not much to say about this, but it'd be more synergetic to the Buffalo Steak Sandvich. **The Pomson 6000** *Level 10 Indivisible Particle Smasher* ~~**Does not require ammo**~~ ~~**Projectile cannot be deflected**~~ ~~**Projectile penetrates multiple enemies and buildings**~~ ~~**Damage removes sappers**~~ ~~**On Hit: Victim loses up to 20% cloak**~~ One of the most annoying weapons in the game and yet one of the most underpowered, the Pomson is a strange case of being broken and yet not powerful enough. So here's my idea. Let's remove the Uber drain and replace it to damage sappers. In exchange for being horrible at damage, the Pomson instead is perfect for removing Sappers from a long range. And thanks to projectile penetration, it can destroy sappers even if a Spy tries to block the projectile. It'd become the Rescue Ranger's long lost brother when it comes to helping buildings from afar. **The Vita-Saw** *Level 5 Bonesaw* ~~**Maximum health increases based on berCharge percentage to a maximum of 20 health**~~ ~~*-10 max health on wearer*~~ What if I were to tell you that the Medic could survive a Sniper headshot WITHOUT the Vaccinator. Well, hopefully with this weapon, that dream can become a reality. The Vita-Saw for a long time has been put down for being a terrible melee for the Medic. But now it may rank as one of the best as you gain survivability the more Uber you have. You don't need to worry about Snipers anymore with this. Okay you still need to worry about Snipers, but you get the point. **The Enforcer** *Level 5 Revolver* ~~**+20% damage bonus while disguised and a very short time aftering undisguising**~~ ~~**+20% faster firing speed immediately attacking after undisguising**~~ ~~**Attacks pierce damage resistance effects and bonuses**~~ ~~*20% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ The recent buff to the Enforcer made it so resistance effects and bonuses were negated. However since this only applies to Sniper's DDS (and even then a backstab would work much better in most situations), here's my proposal. If the Spy immediately shoots again with the Enforcer while he takes his first shot while still disguised, the slower firing speed penalty is negated and the damage bonus still applies. This would allow the Spy to ""enforce"" a bit more damage on a target and would certainly allow the Enforcer to become a bit more usable. That's all the ideas I have for now. So tell me what you think about these ideas. If you like them, I'll consider doing another list of reworks I had in mind. If some of these ideas are bad or would ruin, overpower a weapon, be sure to tell me why. Thank you!"

It's not that hard to build a LOT of level 3 sentry guns, but it requires quite a lot of team co-ordination to kill them all. With lower effectiveness against single Engineers, but higher effectiveness against multiple Engineers, this weapon is sort of like the Vaccinator of Sappers. It acts as a counter, making it less of a hassle for pub teams to deal with excessive numbers of Sentries. The ability to defuse stickytraps also gives Spies a reason to use it when the enemy doesn't have very many Sentries. You can clear out stickybombs covering a capture point in the face of a level 3 Sentry, without getting blown up by it. Conversely, the explosive damage vulnerability gives a small reason to not use this all the time."

Now, what are the chances of you getting exposed to Flame Thrower flames/fire damage, if you are playing Engineer seriously with a Lv. 3 Sentry? Very slim. Only if you are leaving your safe zone for metal, a window for a sneaky W+M1/flarepunch opens. And this scavenging adventure can be avoided completely, if you have a dispenser built up. The first downside is negligible. And ""No random critical hits"" trope? It's also very negligible, due to the modern full-on all-out competitive scene, random crits are not even active. It barely matters.. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So, my proposal to fix the Southern Hospitality would be to amplify it's stats. Add more upsides, and appropriate downsides, to make it balanced and interesting to use. The first upside buff is the bleeding. It now lasts for 6 seconds (Tribalman's Shiv level of bleeds!), and negates minor status buffs when it's active. Whether it's the Magic Conch's regeneration, or a Dead Ringer's damage resistance+speed bonus (It'll still allow cloaking, though bleeding exposes it to daylight.) Major status beef-ups, like a Buff Banner's minicrit charge and a Medic's ber won't be affected. The second and third upsides both affect the wearer's dispenser, which can give out health and metal 40% faster. That's 40 metal/3s and 14 HP/s for a level one dispenser, and a whopping 60 metal/3s and 28 HP/s for a level three dispenser. Not only that, but the wearer also gets a 20% damage resistance while being healed by a dispenser. (Now that's neato.) And the reasoning behind these upsides is to get your base up faster, and get more safety from your dispenser, making the Southern Hospitality possibly the #1 setup wrench. The downside is quite big. The user takes mini-crit damage from explosives. It makes the Engineer extremely fragile when it comes to explosive spam. This downside affects all weapons, so the Rescue Ranger won't save you by increasing healing range. But, the dispenser effectively shields 20% of the 35% minicrit damage, which prevents from getting always one-shot by explosives. Nevertheless, if you explode to bits, kiss your buildings a good-bye too. (Still a better love story than Twilight.) Also, as an added bonus, you can now do the legendary 195+bleeding smack to your counter class. Schweet. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Update #1: Ampified the bleeding trope. It now has an extra second of active time and the bleed also cancels any special effect gained from weapons or skills. (All DR effects, IW damage resistance when cloaked, Medic's regen, etc.) Credit to P90RooshB for this suggestion. Update #2: Changed the explosive vulnerability downside to be active only when the weapon is being used. Credit to P90RooshB for this suggestion. Update #3: Changed the explosive vulnerability downside. It's power has been elevated to mini-crits, instead of just 25%. Also, this new damage vulnerability affects all of the user's weapons. Credit to Samniss_Arandeen for this suggestion. Update #4: Added 2 new upsides. The new upsides are a 40% faster metal and health dispensing rate, and a 20% damage resistance while being healed by a dispenser. Credit to Samniss_Arandeen for this suggestion. ------------------------------------------------------------------- The TL;DR: Adds more content to the Southern Hospitality, to make it the best base-oriented wrench of them all.

672,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,"[IG] ""Sniper Secondaries"" &lt;Sniper, Secondary&gt;",2,4twc5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/4twc5w/ig_sniper_secondaries_sniper_secondary/,2016-07-21 20:28:02,"As it stands, Sniper's weapons are, for the most part, pretty solid. He's got some nice options for primaries and melees, most of which can blend together in any sort of combination, and come out as a good pair. That being said, he's still sorta lacking in regards to his secondaries. Most Snipers will either utilize the SMG for a finisher or the Darwin's Danger Shield as a crutch. These changes aim to change that meta, and for the better. **** **SMG** *Level 2 Automatic Rifle* ~~Damage dealt with this weapon charges up a ""Crikey"" meter. When full, press M2 to gain minicrits for 8 seconds.~~ **Cleaner's Carbine** *Level 4 Automatic Rifle* ~~**On kill: 8 seconds of minicrits**~~ ~~**Crikey meter grants full crits**~~ ~~*Crikey meter builds 50% slower*~~ ~~*-20% clip size*~~ ~~*-25% damage*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ The first few changes are to the SMGs. The stock SMG gets the current ability of the Cleaner's Carbine as a nice little bonus. The SMG is a finisher weapon, and this little buff won't change that - but it -will- give it a nice little niche function. The Cleaner's Carbine, meanwhile, is partially reverted to its old bonus, namely the automatic minicrits from kills. The Crikey meter, being an across-the-board buff for SMGs, gets passed on here too, but is slightly changed: the bonus now grants full crits instead. Again, you won't be seeing too much use of the Crikey bonus, but it's a nice buff nevertheless. To compensate, the Crikey meter builds up slower than the default SMG. Furthermore, the slower firing speed has been swapped out for less damage, giving players with poor aim (ironic, eh?) a better chance to utilize the weapon's bonus. **** **Jarate** *Level 1 Piss Bottle* ~~**Throw at enemies to apply the Jarate effect on them for 10 seconds. For the duration of this effect, enemies receive minicrit damage.**~~ ~~**May throw at burning allies to extinguish them.**~~ ~~Recharges after 20 seconds, or 10 seconds after extinguishing an ally. Recharge time is further reduced by picking up ammo boxes.~~ Jarate is good as it is, however the lack of a secondary after its use can be agonizing. The increased reduction in recharge time from extinguished allies (already in the game, but reduced further here) and ammo boxes should help nullify this problem. **** **Darwin's Danger Shield** *Level 10 Crocodile Skin* ~~**+15% bullet damage resistance**~~ ~~**+25 max health on user**~~ ~~**+50% more health from health packs**~~ ~~*No bullet damage resistance from headshots*~~ ~~*+20% explosive vulnerability on user*~~ ~~*+20% fire vulnerability on user*~~ ~~*-75% health from Medics while active*~~ Darwin's Danger Shield is a big crutch nowadays, and its time that changed. The first big change is to make sure that DDR wearers get headshot like other players. That way, Snipers can counter DDR Snipers without worry. The second change is to make sure Snipers don't get pocketed by Medics. The healing from a nearby Medic has been reduced to the same rate as a Pyro with the Back Scratcher, so now even if a pocketed Sniper survives a headshot, they should still be susceptible to another headshot, or even a body shot. Thirdly, fire vulnerability has been added to give Pyros a chance to disrupt a DDR Sniper, especially if they're being pocketed. This goes well with the recent Pyro buff (which honestly didn't do much at all...but that's another story). To compensate, the DDR now gets additional health from health packs - again, much like the Back Scratcher. This should encourage Snipers to get out of their camps and move around; they'll be able to get more health from doing so. **** **Razorback** *Level 2 Protective Shield* ~~**Blocks a single backstab attempt**~~ ~~**+5 health regenerated per second**~~ ~~**+15% bullet damage resistance while active**~~ ~~*No health regeneration while shield is broken*~~ ~~*No bullet damage resistance from headshots*~~ ~~Shield regenerates after 20 seconds, reduced by using ammo boxes~~ The Razorback is good for a one-time use. After that, it just leaves an empty secondary slot until you run straight back to your spawn room. It's pretty annoying if you're playing aggressively, or if you're too far away from your spawn room; hell, it just encourages you to sit back and camp by your spawn, which can be a poor choice depending on the map. So now the Razorback regenerates over time. This is a much needed change, and is pretty self-explanatory. Next, the Razorback gets the same bullet resistance as the Darwin's Danger Shield. And like the new Darwin's Danger Shield, the Razorback does -not- get this bonus against headshots. This only lasts while the weapon is active, so it should be a nice buff against Spies who can't aim with their Ambassadors. The Razorback also grants an additional 5 health returned per second on the user, but only while the weapon is active. Once broken, that bonus is gone - so watch your backs! **** **Cozy Camper** *Level 4 Backpack* ~~**Health regenerates per second on user over time based on damage taken, for a maximum of +5 health per second**~~ ~~**No flinching while aiming**~~ ~~**Knockback reduced by 25% on user**~~ ~~**Damage dealt charges a ""Crikey"" meter; when full, press M2 to give minicrits to yourself and nearby allies for 8 seconds**~~ ~~*Crikey meter builds 75% slower*~~ The Cozy Camper is decent, but it could do better. The first changes come to knockback and flinching. The knockback buff is useless outside of aiming, which would be pointless if you're aiming for someone as mobile as a Soldier or Scout. Flinching, too, shouldn't have to rely on a fully charged weapon. As the suggested Razorback change has a full 5 HP per second bonus, the Cozy Camper now gets a slightly stronger regenerative bonus; where the Razorback's bonus is constant until broken, the Cozy Camper's bonus is guaranteed, but takes time to accumulate. Lastly is the introduction of the Crikey meter to the secondary. Unlike the suggested SMG or the Cleaner's Carbine, however, the minicrits are granted to nearby players as well, which is a nice supportive and utility function."

The on-landing penalty is to avoid people abusing this pistol's resistances. Originally, this weapon had a jump height bonus, since then the Winger has taken that mantle.

To provide an example of this, imagine what weapon loadouts you would use if all non-stock melee weapons dealt 0 damage to enemies. It's very likely you'd continue to use the Atomizer for triple jumping, Escape Plan/Powerjack/GRU for speed boosts, the Ubersaw for gaining advantages and the Gunslinger for fast-building mini-sentries. Melee weapons are almost never used to deal damage on classes other than Demoknight or Spy, and even when they are, in most cases you could have used a different weapon to have dealt more. This leads to a large imbalance in Melee weapon usage statistics where stock is usually considered the 'worst' option and utility weapons are always considered the best with downsides like ""-20% swing speed"" being considered negligible. This is why I've considered a possible change to melee weapons; &amp;nbsp; ~~**Melee weapons can now be swung without being deployed with a dedicated 'melee' button.**~~ ~~Melee weapons that are not deployed appear on the character model.~~ ~~Swinging your melee weapon will interrupt any reloads and prevent firing for the duration of the swing.~~ &amp;nbsp; As overused of a game-mechanic as this is, I feel as if it would give some increased damage dealing options to many of the classes and broaden the variety of loadouts used at a competitive level. The changes to the character models would ensure that you won't be surprised by getting hit by a melee weapon you didn't know the enemy was carrying. An example of this would be that the Scout's baseball bat would be sticking out of his backpack, the Engineer's Wrench would be strapped to his belt when not deployed, the Heavy would be carrying his Minigun with Boxing Gloves, etc. Of course, these changes would heavily favor certain weapons over others, most notably anything with a passive upside and an active downside, which is why I'm also proposing the following changes to prevent certain weapons from being straight upgrades to their stock counterparts. &amp;nbsp; **HALF-ZATOICHI** ~~**Gain 50% of base health on kill**~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~*Honorbound: Once swung, deals 50 damage to you if it does not kill within 5 seconds.*~~ Obviously, with the ability to passively swing your melee weapon, the 'honorbound' mechanic would be completely useless since the weapon would not be drawn in the first place. This change would prevent the player from swinging carelessly and only using the weapon as a finisher. &amp;nbsp; **SCOUTS** would not benefit too much from this change, though they are typically at very close range when engaging an enemy. Being able to swing your melee weapon quickly would let Scouts finish off weakened opponents at a range where aiming the Scattergun can be disorienting, but due to the low damage his melee weapons deal, coupled with the fact that the enemy can swing back and hit much harder, it becomes much riskier for the Scout to attack enemies at point-blank if they know you're there. &amp;nbsp; **SOLDIERS** benefit somewhat more from this change, as they already have great mid-range damage output. With this change, a Soldier would be able to reliably damage enemies at close range without risking self-damage. However, due to the Soldier's low ground-speed and rocket explosion radius being slightly larger than melee range, it's still no more risky to engage a Soldier at close-range than before. **DISCIPLINARY ACTION** ~~**On Hit Ally: Boosts both players' speed for several seconds.**~~ ~~*-25% damage penalty*~~ ~~Increased Melee range only applies to allies, uses default melee range for damaging enemies.~~ A slight change to prevent Soldiers from having extended melee range against enemies. This means the weapon would use two different hurtboxes, much like stickybombs do. This would means it's possible to speed boost an enemy Spy without actually hurting them, should the Spy position himself well. **MARKET GARDENER** ~~**Deals crits while the wielder is rocket jumping**~~ ~~*20% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*-33% damage penalty while the wielder is not rocket jumping*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ Obviously, the Market Gardener would benefit more from these changes than almost any other weapon, as you wouldn't need to wait for the Market Gardener to deploy and could crit enemies much more quickly. This change makes the Soldier much weaker at defending himself while on the ground to make up for his ambushing strengths. &amp;nbsp; **PYROS** would benefit the most from this melee change, as Pyros typically engage enemies at close-range anyways. Being able to finish off an enemy you're hitting with the Flame Thrower a fraction of a second faster than previously will greatly benefit the Pyro's damage output, as well as strengthening compression blast combos. **AXTINGUISHER** ~~**100% mini-crits against burning players**~~ ~~**100% critical hits against burning players from behind**~~ ~~*-50% damage against non-burning enemies*~~ ~~*20% slower attack speed*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ The Axtinguisher is another weapon that would benefit strongly, as it is currently held back by it's slower deploy speed. Since the Pyro is typically within Melee range of classes he engages, this would be a free 195 damage for almost no vulnerability. This change makes the Pyro much weaker at fighting enemies who are immune to afterburn, as well as preventing instant 195 damage hits while being able to quickly defend yourself with compression blasts afterwards. &amp;nbsp; **DEMOMAN** ~~*Shields only provide resistances while deployed (melee weapon is out)*~~ Demoman is already one of the strongest classes in the game, only balanced by his inability to defend himself at close ranges against Scouts and Pyros. Allowing hybrid Demoknights to effortlessly switch between close and long-range combat would remove his fundamental weakness to ambushing. **CLAIDHEAMH MOR** ~~**0.5 sec. longer charge time**~~ ~~*-15 Health on wearer.*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ Bringing the Claidheamh Mor back to it's old stats would prevent it's only downside from being an active one. **THE SCOTSMAN'S SKULLCUTTER** ~~**+20% damage bonus**~~ ~~*-7% move speed on wearer*~~ The move speed penalty only applies when the Demoman has the Skullcutter deployed. Since it would no longer need to be deployed to be swung, this would make the Skullcutter a straight upgrade to stock if the Demoman wasn't running full-Demoknight. **ULLAPOOL CABER** ~~*20% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ Removed the slower deploy speed of the Caber, since it would never really need to be deployed in the first place. Due to how many nerfs the Caber has had recently, I opted not to change it any further. &amp;nbsp; **HEAVIES** would benefit strongly at close-range from this change, as they would be able to quickly punch-out an enemy without the need to wait for their Miniguns to finish unrevving. Heavy's melee weapons would be great for quickly dispatching Spies that fail their backstab attempts and Scouts who get too close to you during an ambush, greatly improving Heavy's speed at adapting to a new fight and making him more dangerous to approach, even without his Minigun deployed. **WARRIOR'S SPIRIT** ~~**+30% damage bonus**~~ ~~**+50 health restored on kill**~~ ~~*-30 max health on wearer*~~ Another weapon with an active downside, this change makes the Warrior's Spirit have a passive downside. &amp;nbsp; **ENGINEERS** benefit strongly from this change by allowing an Engineer to repair his buildings without having to switch away from his primary weapons, allow him to defend and repair his nest almost simultaneously. **RESCUE RANGER** ~~**Alt-Fire: Use metal to pick up buildings from long range**~~ ~~**Fires a special bolt that can repair friendly buildings based on distance traveled.**~~ ~~*-34% clip size*~~ ~~*-50% max primary ammo on wearer*~~ ~~*Self mark for death on building pick up*~~ The Engineer's ability to swing his wrench without putting away his other weapons would make repairing a Sentry under fire happen way too quickly by combining fire from the Rescue Ranger and Wrench. This change would lower the point-blank repair speed of the Rescue Ranger preventing Engineers from repairing buildings too quickly. **WRANGLER** ~~*Wrangling will not increase Sentry turning speed.*~~ To prevent Engineers from repairing their Sentries while firing, this change would increase the time between aiming at and locking onto an enemy, so when the Sentry is briefly disabled while you swing your wrench, you can't immediately continue firing at a target. &amp;nbsp; **MEDICS** would benefit somewhat from the change, as they can defend themselves at close-range while their Mediguns are still deployed. Furthermore, this gives a stronger downside to the Ubersaw, as you would spend 20% longer not healing your allies whenever you swing it, compared to the stock Bonesaw. &amp;nbsp; **SNIPERS** would not benefit too greatly from this change, as they are rarely within melee range of an enemy anyways. **BUSHWACKA** ~~**100% Critical hits against wet players**~~ ~~*-20% Swing speed*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ I'm not gonna lie, I only put this here so we can see Pyro-Sharks fighting Croc-o-Snipers. And, you know, replacing the active downside with a passive one. &amp;nbsp; **SPIES** would benefit greatly from this change as they can now sap a building and stab the Engineer almost immediately afterwards, making him a much harder counter to stacking Engineers. Additionally, a Spy can defend himself with his revolver and then quickly stab an enemy should he bait them into a trickstab scenario, giving him even more versatility is combat. &amp;nbsp; In conclusion, this melee change would not only increase the usefulness of non-utility melee weapons, but it's a universal buff to the more underused competitive classes (Pyro, Engineer, Spy, Heavy) while not benefiting the more common 'core classes' (Scout, Soldier, Medic, Sniper) nearly as much."

This weapon does that, with an increase in mobility that can easily get you in and get you out, as long as any Pyros don't jump to the rescue. Yes, it does push a little on the Atomizer's reign over the melee skies, but this one simply gives overall utility in movement and an increase in jump height on par with the Winger. In short, a utility to get in and get out, provided Pyros aren't involved. (I also tip my hat to anyone who can guess the 79 reference.)

Standard mediguns overheal 50% max health, while this one would now overheal a full 100% giving an overhealed heavy a whopping 600HP , or a soldier 400 HP. The decay though is greatly increased, so within 3 or 4 seconds of getting overhealed that high, you'd be back down to almost less than a standard overheal (I think the 35% decay rate would keep it fair but might need to be higher to keep 500+ health heavies strolling around for more than a few seconds). The aura during uber would probably be about 3 or 4 character lengths wide which would prevent overheal decay for the 8 second duration, allowing the medic to heal several people during the uber rather than just sticking to 1.

The solution is to make the bullets more accurate, so you can continue to deal decent damage at a further range. In order to balance out the weapon, since it is more powerful of a weapon, dealing around the same damage while also dealing knockback, you have damage vulnerability while it is active, lowering your effective health to 250. In addition, the weapon spins up slower, making it harder to quickly ambush or react to ambushes, solidifying it's role as an area denial weapon."

(Damage ramp-up remains, now indicated by a slight change in pitch of the Minigun's firing sound while it is not fully ramped). Spinning-down ""cannot swap weapons"" time of Heavy primaries shortened by 50%: Now able to put away your Minigun almost immediately after you stop holding down M1 (a little time remains for balance purposes). The Heavy accuracy ramp-up time nerf has been a constant source of complaint for Heavy mains, as it is detrimental to Heavy's viability and also skill ceiling when you can't control your own weapon. I also buffed spin-down time so that Shotgun will be a slightly more viable choice over Sandvich, so Heavies can quickswap to their Shotgun to conserve minigun ammo. **Killing Gloves of Boxing** ~~**On Kill: 5 seconds of 100% critical chance**~~ ~~*20% firing speed penalty*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ This one has been a common suggestion from Medieval Mode players, and makes sense to me. It's a weapon that guarantees you with crits on everything (including your primary) for the duration. Thus earning its crit boost should require a fair kill first, rather than a random crit. As an added side benefit, removing random crits from KGB would also mean that ""hoovy boxing"" matches, which take place in Trade servers and so on, would no longer be decided by luck. **Gloves of Running Urgently** (Credit to two different users for this one, TF2SolarLight and TypeOneNinja, though their suggestions vary on the HP reduction.) ~~**+30% faster move speed on user when active**~~ ~~*-35 max health on wearer*~~ ~~*This weapon equips 50% slower*~~ (was holsters) Some may not think GRU even needs nerfing, so I'll roughly explain why I (and others) think it does. GRU slows down the game, by allowing both teams to run a high-health Heavy to mid, who becomes a brick wall that prevents either team from making offensive pushes because Heavy puts out a lot of damage to anyone who gets near him. It's also, even after repeated nerfs, [still one of the only Heavy melees anyone has been using in matchmaking or pubs.](URL Heavy is super tanky, dishes out heaps of damage, and has decent range. His weakness is mobility; he's slow to get into battle or dodge attacks, and slow to spin up and spin down his Minigun. So, if the GRU is going to allow him to be faster, I think it should take away a bit of his high health as well, as a fair, meaningful tradeoff. Currently the ""mini-crits taken and reduced melee damage"" isn't enough to balance the GRU. People simply holster it before reaching the front line, thus not taking minicrits. A [passive](URL max HP penalty, however, would apply no matter whether you had the weapon out or not. This would make Heavy more fun and balanced to play against at midfights. Nerfing GRU allows me to suggest buffs to Heavy's Minigun, as well. **Eviction Notice** ~~**+25% faster firing speed**~~ ~~**15% faster movement speed while active**~~ ~~**Gain a speed boost on hit**~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability on user while spun up*~~ ~~*40% damage penalty*~~ Currently EN is ""GRU lite"", so I tried to maintain that while nerfing it a bit too so it doesn't just replace GRU; but instead of a max HP penalty, less effective HP while spun up (like a reverse Natascha), which makes this weapon synergize both with the Shotgun/Family Business/Panic Attack, as well as the Tomislav. **Disciplinary Action** Speed boost on hit reduced from 20/30/40% to 10/20/30%: Not a Heavy weapon, but used for similar purposes to GRU to boost heavies to the frontlines in competitive TF2, and as such needs to be nerfed too for the GRU nerf to be effective or else people will just get whipped there anyway. Disciplinary Action is banned in all 6v6 leagues for this exact reason, and in Highlander where it's not banned, all Soldiers are basically forced to run it to mid to compete. **Holiday Punch** ~~**Critical hit forces victim to laugh**~~ ~~**Always crits from behind**~~ ~~*Critical hits do no damage*~~ ~~*-25% damage penalty*~~ (new) Holiday Punch's only downside is that it will not deal damage upon a random critical hit, instead stunning the target. Since competitive has no random crits, this is not a weakness and Holiday Punch is a straight upgrade to stock in MM. Adding a damage penalty will fix this, and also fits nicely with the theme of the cushiony mittens. **Warrior's Spirit** ~~**Heal on kill buffed from 50 to 75**~~ The most maligned Heavy melee. **The Fists of Steel** ~~**-40% damage from ranged sources while active**~~ ~~*+100% damage from melee sources on wearer*~~ (previously only while active) ~~*This weapon holsters 100% slower*~~ A mild nerf to FoS, changing the part-time effect to a full-time effect.

Since health regeneration decreases if damage was recently taken, and the Medic takes more damage from all sources, protecting your Medic becomes a much larger priority, not just from bombs, but spam and chip damage as well. The shared regen can scale from 3-6hp/s giving a bonus of up to 25% with the default medigun or 12.5% if the Medic is getting hurt. Since this weapon increases damage vulnerability and prevents self-regen when not healing a player, it makes the Medic much more vulnerable alone or when his pocket is overwhelmed, forcing him to stick close to his team and strongly damages survivability during a retreat. *my German grammar is probably way off*"

Being hit by the ball is annoying because it's an instant slowdown and potentially even a 7-second stun, in a very fast-paced game where the time-to-kill is usually around ~2 seconds. So, based on the interesting effects of projectiles colliding with one another, I designed it to do this; reminiscent of airblast, but a sparingly-used life-saver. - On the upside; firing your baseball off will destroy any projectiles that come near it while it's in flight. This lets you survive otherwise doomed situations and works very well in narrow or high-traffic areas where you can destroy multiple projectiles at once, briefly clearing a path for yourself. The ball has a fairly large hitbox and can hit enemies or counter projectiles much easier than it does currently, so you don't need to worry that it'll be near-impossible to make this useful. Also, it will still deal 15 damage on contact with an enemy, just in case you want to finish an enemy off and laugh at their misfortune. - On the downside; you have a greatly increased explosive vulnerability. You need to stay at range from Soldiers and Demomen, who can very easily deal 125 damage in a single pill / stickybomb / rocket in close quarters, and staying at range is where the baseball is best suited to taking out multiple projectiles at once. Get too close, and you can be one-shot. Stay away, pick your fights carefully, and keep a baseball on you if you want to get in close to an explosive class. - Alternative versions of this weapon include; a variant where the baseball reflects the projectiles back for mini-crit damage. A variant where the projectiles are simply deflected, still capable of dealing damage to you. - Overall, it's a much-needed rework of a terribly-designed weapon, designed as a more team-supportive Scout's weapon and as a skill-based counter to the classes most deadly to him."

The idea is to keep its mechanic of retaining uber when you die, but not make you more vunerable to death and adding more strategy/team play for when you should save some uber. When you think your team can deal with the enemy without the uber you can use your time to charge the vita-saw and then when you have the uber ready you can go all in and not be afraid of dieing for the enemy uber or after your uber finishes, since the vita-saw will reward you with 25% uber ready when you just used one (and died). While there is a lot of upsides, you still need to be aware of your surroundings and make sure that no one can hit you while charging the vita-saw since you will die much more easyly.

This helps you out a lot in numerous events, ranging from 1v1 situations where a quick switch-and-swing saves you from certain death to helping out around the base by stopping Soldiers from blowing up a nearby Sentry. While it doesn't have a specific playstyle attached to it, it has a niche that works in a variety of playstyles. - On the downside; swing speed is reduced, and you take more damage from all sources. The first downside is to avoid making you invulnerable to enemies using projectiles by giving you a 0.75 swing speed, since a Scout could reflect faster than the enemy could fire otherwise. The second downside is to make you reliant on it - you're more vulnerable to damage (especially burst damage like, say, rockets and pipe bombs), so you need to keep your distance (which is where this weapon shines, since you have time to reflect) and avoid damage as much as possible by reflecting it where you can. - It synergises with a few weapons. The Baby Face's Blaster lets you move incredibly fast and makes you difficult to hit, which counters your damage vulnerability. The Crit-a-Cola would ideally turn reflected projectiles into mini-crit ones as well as give you ridiculous speed. The Pistols make excellent counterparts, since they work well at chipping away enemy health from the distance you're optimally reflecting at. - Overall, it's probably not a good idea - ""the Pyro should be the only one to reflect,"" ""the Scout's going to become even more annoying,"" ""you always complain about people not contributing new playstyles on their weapons and you show us a weapon without a playstyle,"" etc. etc. etc. I'm expecting that.

As a drawback, they cannot pick up ammo or health while in this state. Interestingly, when two spies are both using this watch, they can see and interact with each other normally, including spies on the opposite team.

In order to maintain it's competitive 'fairness' without completely overhauling two-shot primaries, a huge downside needed to be added. The ability to gain jumps for moving around seems a bit on the weird side of the risk/reward spectrum. I'd like for the jumps to be obtained via some sort of skill-based ability, rather than just waiting long enough. Additionally, the massive downside to this weapon means you'll have to run it with the rest of the #1 fan set to make up for your lost jump. **BACK SCATTER** ~~**Mini-crits targets when fired at from behind or above from close range**~~ ~~*-34% clip size*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ The Back Scatter is one of the few weapons I feel has no redeemable qualities. The gimmick this weapon had was increased damage for sneaking up on enemies, but unlike the knife or backburner, had very little reward for the amount of risk involved. The knife can backstab at 180 degrees, allowing a skilled Spy to do trickstabs like the matador or corner-stab. The Backburner has an only 90 degree radius, but makes up for this with it's faster firing speed. Even if one flame misses, there will be many others to allow the Pyro to make up for the precision required. The Back Scatter has a small radius and a slow firing speed, making it incredibly difficult to pull off this maneuver, and even when you do, the decreased accuracy and Clip Size coupled with Scout's low health makes it almost impossible to escape with your life in exchange for a measly 35% boost in damage (since the fall-off bonus hardly helps at close-range). This buff allows the Scout to not only get the mini-crit bonus from behind, but when attacking from above (Note that the mini-crit would only apply if the Scout is facing down at a certain angle (say, &lt;10 degrees from the -y axis), so slight height advantages would not activate the mini-crits.) This greatly increases the reliability of the weapon's functions and greatly rewards very aggressive play. **BABY FACE'S BLASTER** ~~**On Hit: Builds Boost**~~ ~~*-34% clip size*~~ *When Boost is full, Alt-Fire to activate Boost Mode for additional running speed* ~~*No double jumping while Boost is active*~~ stolen from [/u/Vitztlampaehecatl](URL **PRETTY BOY'S POCKET PISTOL** ~~**Wearer does not take fall damage**~~ *While Deployed:* ~~**On kill: +25 health**~~ ~~**Overheal does not decay**~~ ~~*+20% damage vulnerability*~~ Currently, the healing from the pocket pistol is completely outclassed by the Mad Milk. Due to the increased damage vulnerability while deployed, the health regen doesn't help out much in a fight. The only neat thing about this weapon is the removal of fall-damage, and even then, it's only there for Scouts who can't risk a double jump. The changes I've added give a greater risk/reward value to the weapon, allowing a Scout to maintain his overheal while away from the combo. The increased damage vulnerability makes it more dangerous to have out when getting ambushed or flanked, but as long as the user maintains good situational awareness they can initiate most fights with the odds in their favor by having a health advantage from the start. The weapon still has strengths as a finisher, as the 25 health you gain from a kill can overheal the user and then be kept with you while you go into your next fight. **BONK! ATOMIC PUNCH** ~~**Grants 4 seconds of invincibility**~~ *Effect lasts longer when damage is blocked.* One of the more 'broken' weapons in the metagame, the Bonk! allows the Scout to get behind the enemy team almost for free. This leads to a situation where the enemy team must send a player back to fight the scout or risk having him ambush them from behind, if not back-cap. Once a player is sent back, you must hope they win the 1v1, or else you have the same problem as before, except you're a man down on the front lines as well. It forces the enemy team to run Bonk! as well, just to even the situation for the teams slightly. This puts stress on the players as numbers are now determined by 1v1s, rather than coordination and team-play. Additionally, since this weapon is much less effective when there is no 'back-line' to run to, it's significantly weaker against a team holding last. This means the defending team is always at an advantage when Bonk! is in play which leads to stale-matey gameplay. The changes I've made force Bonk! to be used as a scouting tool and a distraction for sentries. Trying to get behind the enemy team in only 4 seconds is much harder to do. Since the duration of the effect increases with damage taken, sentries must be disabled in some way in order to stop the Scout's effect. **CRIT-A-COLA** ~~*No random crits on any weapon while equipped.*~~ *While under the effects* ~~**Your attacks mini-crit.**~~ ~~*Marked for death.*~~ ~~*-80% health from all healing sources while active*~~ This brings the CaC closer to it's old self, which wasn't nearly as game-breaking. A 10% increase in damage taken lowers the Scout's effective health to 112.5 (166.5 with overheal) which is always a better trade for a 35% increase in damage and resistance to fall-off, to say nothing of the speed boost making it even easier to dodge. This change makes the scout significantly more fragile under the effects as a better trade-off for the increased damage. The lowered healing from all sources also enforce the 'glass cannon' effect of Crit-a-Cola, as the Scout can no longer circumvent the increased vulnerability by being pocketed by a quick-fix Medic. **ATOMIZER** ~~**Grants an extra jump that consumes [(10% of your current health) + 5]HP**~~ ~~*-30% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*-20% damage vs players*~~ As it is now, the Atomizer is one of the strongest Scout melees in the game. The trade-off it gives is huge, as dodging ~80 damage for a loss of 10 health is barely a trade at all, and weapons like Mad Milk or the PbPP can almost completely offset this weapon's downsides. Increasing the health loss at higher health and lowering it at lower health gives a greater reward from this weapon the more risk the player using it has. **FAN O'WAR** ~~**Crits when it would normally mini-crit**~~ ~~**On Hit: Target is marked for death, causing all damage taken to be mini-crits**~~ ~~**On Crit: Applies Mad Milk effect to the target**~~ ~~*-75% damage penalty*~~ ~~*-35% swing speed penalty*~~ Previously, there was no reason to hit an enemy with the Fan O'War, as in the time you deployed it, hit an enemy and switched to another weapon, you could've easily gotten in 200+ damage by just shooting the enemy to begin with. The Mad Milk effect gives the Scout more motivation to mark enemies, as you and your teammates can recover health off of them while killing them. This is really only good for killing enemies who aren't much capable of fighting back, so I doubt this will increase it's use in competitive games, but at least it's fun in pubs now. **SUN-ON-A-STICK** ~~**On hit: Ignites the enemy**~~ ~~*On miss: Hit yourself, idiot.*~~ ~~*-50% afterburn time*~~ This change still rewards team-play with a Pyro (as it's much easier to get close to an enemy as Scout than as Pyro) with the added effect of not being completely useless otherwise. Plus, now that the Pyro can gain health from an extinguish, you can 'build' health or Manmelter crits with this, so that's kind of neat. **SANDMAN** ~~**Alt-fire: Launches a ball that stuns based on it's airtime.**~~ *Stun functions similarly to Razorback's* ~~*25% less damage to players*~~ ~~*60% slower holstering speed*~~ stun :^) Being able to spam anything with no damage fall-off across the map and take a player out of the game for several seconds should not have been added ever. Now this weapon's stun only prevents firing and switching weapons, without adding any movement penalties at all. It can still help out in a fight and remove certain players, but it is by no means a death sentence now. The downsides to this weapon no longer make a Scout play more passively all game, but only while the weapon is deployed. The slower holstering speed and lowered damage make it more difficult for a Scout to kill an enemy he stunned by himself and more vulnerable to enemies you don't hit with the stun ball, making it more 'teamwork friendly' than before. **WRAP ASSASSIN** ~~**Alt-Fire: Fires a projectile that explodes, creating a temporary cloud of team-colored glitter. Enemies standing in the cloud take bleed damage.**~~ ~~*-65% damage*~~ ~~*+100% damage over-time effect vulnerability*~~ Previously, this weapon was seen as a straight upgrade, as lowering damage on a weapon that's rarely used for swinging doesn't make it much less useful at all. Now it largely works as before with an added AoE to the projectile, allowing the Scout to somewhat deny an area by causing bleed damage to enemies inside of it. The bleed damage really only effects lower health enemies, as simply walking through it will only deal a small amount of damage. It mostly prevents enemies from staying in a single spot for an extended period of time (Snipers, Engineers, Heavies). Scout normally has trouble with very passive, defensive play where an enemy shows few openings, and this can force them to relocate, opening them up to being flanked.

So, I decided to change its focus away from being an anti-Sniper item to being a survival item. It keeps its +25 base health and now has +25% bullet resistance. This makes it a little easier to deal with other bullet classes (i.e. the Scattergun needs to fire four shots at base damage to kill the wearer instead of three). Now, to counteract this and make Sniper battles fair, it has +35% critical hit vulnerability. This means an uncharged headshot from a Sniper Rifle will do 151 damage despite the bullet resistance. Now it only helps against bodyshotting Snipers. The explosive vulnerability was increased to 25% since 20% vulnerability didn't really matter because of the +25 base health.

Jumper are both very gimmicky items, that require each other in order to be truly viable. Without the parachute, Air Strike is just a slightly less damaging Rocket Launcher, which transforms into a rocket machine gun while airborne via rocket jumps. The problem is, you will be airborne only for 1-3 seconds with an usual rocket jump, resulting in a rarely used gimmick. As for the clipsize increase on kill, it is not enough to be the primary upside of the gun when it is used alone. (Not gonna deal with the B.A.S.E.

But, if you manage to kill 3 more people in less than 8 seconds after the last kill, you get +60% damage resistance and a health restoration of 40 HP. These affect you both in the air and while roaming the ground. Additionally, you can jump about without taking fall damage while the Air Strike is out, and make your clipsize double on a blast jump kill (2-&gt;4-&gt;8 max). But, the downsides are there. -50% clip size makes you play less aggressively in the start, and encourages killing while blast jumping. The +30% damage vulnerability downside kicks in only when you fail to chain kills with the Air Strike, so do not be a pacifist after you have killed somebody. Is it balanced?

So instead of hiting enemies from afar, why not get closer to them? This is a weapon that will synergize well with the Cloak and Dagger, for the patient spies who wait behind enemy lines, and pick people off from behind or pick of stragglers. Now here's the problem: Trickstabs n facestabs. Wouldnt this make this incredibly fristrating to play against? Yes. It would. However: This knife makes you VERY vulnerable while undisguised, and trying to battle someone to get off that lucky face-stab or trickstab, will most likely get you killed, which is where the vulnerability and lower health comes in. Now with the cloak on kill allows you to try and escape with more cloak before getting shot at by everyone who sees you dashing at someone.

721,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,"[IG] ""Heavy rework thread"" &lt;Heavy All&gt;",16,49n8r8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/49n8r8/ig_heavy_rework_thread_heavy_all/,2016-03-09 19:40:32,"Alright, these are my biased opinions on how to rework Heavy as a Heavy main. # Class General ~~**Base movement speed increased to 80% (spun-up speed unchanged)**~~ People do not like playing Heavy because he is too slow. So I'm buffing him very slightly in this respect; now he moves exactly as fast as Soldier. # Primary Weapons **The Love &amp; War Nerf** *Level 6 2014 Rebalancing* ~~*All Heavy primaries have damage and accuracy ramp-ups not reached until 2 seconds of shooting*~~ ~~**Keeping spun up with secondary fire counts toward removing both**~~ I dislike the Love &amp; War nerf, but I think that jump-revving into a crowd of enemies and mowing them down is unfair and outside of the Heavy's role, especially when Heavy was designed to have little importance in aiming skill. I dislike that before the nerf Heavy vs. Heavy was about who was the first to fire, and I dislike that after the nerf Heavy vs. Heavy is about who shoots the air for a few seconds to get full damage. This way, a Heavy is rewarded for being spun up and prepared for enemies, but is easier to ambush, as he should be. **Minigun** *Level 1 Minigun* ~~**Can switch weapons without spinning down**~~ This applies to all Miniguns, of course. I would love to be able to switch to the Shotgun and keep attacking while retreating or pursuing, or to switch to my melee and take a swing at that Scout who's in my face. Competitive Heavies, who are constantly with their Medic, use the Sandvich primarily as a health pack for their teammates, and maps have plenty of health packs already. But I can't switch weapons without waiting a second for my Minigun to spin down. The 0.5 second weapon switch speed should provide sufficient counterplay for the defender. In general, this change speeds up how Heavy is played, and that's a good thing. **The Tomislav** *Level 5 Minigun* ~~**+20% faster spin-up time**~~ ~~**+6 health regenerated per second on wearer (ramps up from 1 if recently damaged)**~~ ~~**Silent killer: no barrel spin sound**~~ ~~*20% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*-35% healing from healers on wearer*~~ The Tomislav is ""balanced"" as it is, but it does not have a defined role; a Tomislav Heavy and a Stock Heavy will play in the same way. With these changes I establish the weapon's role as a Minigun for a roaming Heavy. **Natascha** ~~**On hit: gain up to +6 health per attack (scales with damage dealt)**~~ ~~**-20% damage resistance while spun up**~~ ~~*-25% slower spin-up time*~~ ~~*-20% slower firing speed*~~ Inspired by /u/SileAnimus' suggestion on reworking the weapon. However, because a Heavy can deal a highly variable amount of damage with every hit (from 2 to 54), he should be rewarded for dealing more damage. **The Huo-Long Heater** *Level 1 Minigun* ~~**100% mini-crit vs. burning players**~~ ~~**Creates a ring of flames while spun up**~~ ~~*-25% max primary ammo on wearer*~~ ~~*No ammo from Dispensers when active*~~ Also from /u/SileAnimus, the Huo-Long Heater happens to give the Heavy some protection against Spies, but its role is more defined as a teamwork weapon with friendly Pyros. Perhaps the range of the fire ring ought to be extended slightly? **The Brass Beast** *Level 5 Minigun* ~~When weapon is active:~~ ~~**+20% faster firing speed**~~ ~~*+20% damage vulnerability when not spun up*~~ Entirely /u/SileAnimus' suggestion, and I think it's great. The Brass Beast is part of a set that emphasizes melee play, so the Heavy will not have his primary active as much. # Secondary weapons **The Sandvich** ~~**Eat to gain up to 300 health**~~ ~~**Alt-fire: share with a friend (medium health kit)**~~ ~~*-35% less healing from healers on wearer*~~ A risky proposal I know, but it has recently occurred to me that the Sandvich suffers from the trope of self-reliance without the cost of team synergy. Now its role is as Valve originally intended: ""The Sandvich is a great tool for a Heavy defending an area, as it gives him the ability to replenish health between enemy waves without having to abandon his post."" **The Family Business** ~~When weapon is active:~~ ~~**+34% clip size**~~ ~~**+15% faster firing speed**~~ ~~**+15% faster move speed on wearer**~~ ~~*-20% damage penalty*~~ ~~*+20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ The Family Business now becomes more of a ""Fat Scout"" Shotgun. The damage vulnerability can be counteracted well by the Tomislav's health regen, or even by Natascha's health on hit. **The Buffalo Steak Sandvich** *Level 1 Lunchbox* ~~While under the effects:~~ ~~**+35% faster movement speed on wearer**~~ ~~**100% mini-crit chance**~~ ~~*Player may only use melee weapons*~~ ~~*-50% less healing from Medics*~~ ~~*Can no longer be thrown to other players*~~ To quote /u/SileAnimus again: ""Most classes can take down a BSS heavy before they even get to close range. Damage vulnerability is counterproductive to the weapons role. But since this could easily be exploited by having a pocket Medic, the Heavy must get reduced healing when under its effect."" I might even suggest damage resistance while under the effects. The throwing nerf is to define the weapon's role. **The Dalokohs Bar** ~~**Eat to gain up to 100 health**~~ ~~**Adds +50 max health for 30 seconds**~~ ~~**Now stacks with a Medic's overheal**~~ ~~**Alt-fire: share with a friend (small health kit)**~~ ~~*-5% max overheal on wearer*~~ ~~*Can no longer overheal*~~ ~~*Increase recharge time to 15 seconds*~~ The Dalokohs Bar takes the place of the Sandvich as the team-oriented lunchbox item and comes into its own as a viable item. The overheal penalty ensures that the Heavy can still be killed by a fully charged Machina headshot. # Melee weapons Balancing Heavy melees can now be a little more flexible, because the spin-down buffs and the new Buffalo Steak Sandvich allow his combat melees to come to light. His utility melees are balanced as is, though I might add a firing speed penalty to the Fists of Steel and/or increase the Gloves of Running Urgently's damage penalty to 50%. **The Killing Gloves of Boxing** *Level 7 Boxing Gloves* ~~**On kill: 5 seconds of 100% critical chance**~~ ~~*On kill: marked for death for 7 seconds*~~ ~~*20% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ The days of Heavies going on Medieval Mode KGB crit killstreaks are far from over, but at least it will be a little easier to fight back. The same goes for regular play, where the Heavy will have to choose his fights wisely after a KGB kill. No random crits is self-explanatory. **The Warrior's Spirit** *Level 10 Boxing Gloves* ~~**+30% damage bonus**~~ ~~**+25 Health on Hit (up from 10)**~~ ~~**+125 Health on Kill**~~ ~~*-5 Health drained per second when active*~~ ~~*-20 health on miss*~~ ~~*Blocks healing while active and for 5 seconds after*~~ Another quote from /u/SileAnimus: ""The passive health loss from this weapon at the moment does not make sense, as it affects the user at all times. Changing the downside to health loss when active, it becomes a more prominent downside, but does not create as much of a passive loss as -20 health. To counterbalance that, the weapon now rewards far more for hitting players. But to reduce the possibility of being abused for building Uber, the user cannot be healed by medics while this weapon is active and for a few seconds after being put away."" **The Eviction Notice** *Level 10 Boxing Gloves* ~~**+40% faster firing speed**~~ ~~**Gain a speed boost on hit**~~ ~~**Combo attack: a third consecutive punch will always be a critical hit**~~ ~~*-60% damage penalty*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ The weapon's role is now thoroughly defined as allowing a Heavy to keep up in melee combat (hence the independence that pairs with the Tomislav and Family Business), and it has enough upsides to be viable compared to the Fists. **The Holiday Punch** *Level 10 Fists* ~~**On hit: enemy's vision is partially obscured by falling snowflakes for 2 seconds**~~ ~~**On hit: enemy hears nothing but a loud jingling sound for 2 seconds**~~ ~~*-50% damage penalty*~~ ~~*On kill: forces you to laugh*~~ As funny a weapon as the Holiday Punch is, it interferes with a player's ability to control their own movement, a big no-no in TF2. Its role is now thoroughly defined as a disorientation weapon rather than a stun or slowdown."

All backpacks require 600 damage to charge the rage meter, so getting a kill would fill a quater of the meter, this independent of the actual damage caused by the weapon which also adds to the rage meter. Getting a kill while under the effect of rage still refills a 1/4th of the meter, extending the time of the buff longer. Further more this weapon can be used while a backpack is active to gain mobility to catch up with allied, charge towards an objective faster, or make a daring escape. But like any bayonet charge, using this weapon can be risky with the added ranged damage vulnerability, so be careful not to get mowed down.

A pub team getting rolled because nobody wants to play it. Waiting 20 minutes for a slot to fill so you can play a lobby. A Match-Making game where people are playing RPS to decide who has to play what seems to be the most beloved, yet least popular class in the game, the Medic. A good Medic is the backbone of a good team, yet, despite the advantage Medic gives, nobody wants to be a ""glorified spectator"" when playing TF2. I myself am guilty of never playing Medic outside of lobbies as I find it frustrating to heal players 'worse' than I am. The idea behind these changes would be not only to 'balance' all of Medic's primary and melee weapons, but to make the class more interesting and engaging to play, hopefully encouraging more people to become interested in picking him. ~~**Medigun beam length increased**~~ ~~**Healing rate increases with proximity to healing target**~~ The idea here is to make healing a target a much more engaging activity. Currently, healing consists mostly of clicking on a player and hoping they don't kill themselves, but this change gives a Medic more involvement in the actual healing process. There is now a unique 'risk/reward' in healing a player during a fight, as getting closer to them will heal them more effectively but put you at higher risk, and standing further from them keeps you safer at the cost of a lowered healing rate. ~~**Medigun remains active while other weapons are deployed**~~ ~~Medigun must be active during an ubercharge~~ This creates an entirely new playstyle for the Medic, as you are now able to shoot enemies while giving health to teammates. Since you must now focus on two targets at once to play effectively, this makes Medic a significantly more involved class than before. **WEAPON BALANCES** **Crusader's Crossbow** *Level 15 Crossbow* ~~*No Headshots*~~ ~~*-75% max primary ammo on wearer*~~ ~~*-90% medigun healing rate while deployed*~~ ~~Fires special bolts that heal teammates and deal damage based on distance traveled~~ ~~This weapon will reload automatically when not active~~ Compared to it's previous stats, the Crusader's Crossbow is still the same as always, with the added downside that your Medigun is nowhere near as effective while you have the Crossbow deployed. This prevents the Medic from having two sources of building ubercharge at once and serves as a downside for the increased utility granted by the Crossbow that makes it dominate both pubs and competitive play. **BLUTSAUGER** *Level 5 Syringe Gun* ~~**+Regen and healing rate increase with damage recently dealt**~~ ~~*-2 health drained per second on wearer*~~ These changes give the Medic a way to further increase healing rate for playing more aggressively. The downside is the same as before, weakening the Medic's health regen and making him more vulnerable. **AMPUTATOR** *Level 15 Bonesaw* *When weapon is active:* ~~**Doubles health regeneration on wearer**~~ ~~**Alt-Fire: Applies a healing effect to all nearby teammates**~~ ~~*33% damage vulnerability while active*~~ Like the Blutsauger, this makes the Medic much more vulnerable to damage while allowing you to quickly regenerate health during downtime. This is great to have deployed between pushes, when there are no enemies around and you're trying to move forwards with the rest of your team, no time to make a detour for a health kit. This issue the weapon brings, is that you can be killed much more quickly if you are caught off-guard, meaning you will need to be much more aware of your surroundings when running this weapon. **SOLEMN VOW** *Level 10 Bust of Hippocrates* ~~**Allows you and your healing target to see enemy health**~~ ~~*Breaks after damaging an enemy, preventing healing target from gaining the bonus*~~ ~~*Makes your health viewable by the enemy team*~~ *'Do no harm.'* Previously, this weapon was banned in competitive play for allowing a Medic to see the enemy's Ubercharge % without needing to count advantages. This change, rather than forcing the enemy team to run it as well to keep up, would simply give that advantage to the enemy team as well. Keeping with the 'Do no harm' theme of the weapon, part of the upside is lost upon harming an enemy, making it more of a priority to ensure your Medic does not have to use it. **UBERSAW** *Level 10 Bonesaw* ~~**On hit: 25% ubercharge added**~~ ~~*-20% swing speed*~~ ~~*Cannot heal while deployed*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ The current Medic meta, the Ubersaw allows the Medic to quickly gain some Ubercharge while defending himself or fighting an overwhelmed opponent. These changes still let the Ubersaw function as before, with the necessary change that your Medigun beam deactivates while you have the Ubersaw deployed (to prevent Uberchaining from reaching ridiculous extremes). I also added 'No random critical hits' because I got killed by it in a pub once and it made me angry ;_; **VITASAW** *Level 5 Bonesaw* ~~**On hit: 10% ubercharge added**~~ ~~*-1HP Drained per second on wearer*~~ Currently, the Vitasaw is banned in competitive play as it grants a Medic's team Uber advantage after the Medic drops. This forces the enemy Medic to run the Vitasaw as well, in order to mitigate the punishment for dying the second the enemy team counters with their own. I'm not quite sure if there is a way to preserve the 'Retain Uber on Death' mechanic without making this weapon imbalanced at all, so I dropped it altogether to create an 'Ubersaw-lite'. Ultimately, I think these changes create a unique downside to every Medic weapon, making none of them stand out above the others, or fall behind (stock included). I've always believed that, when a weapon is overused or overpowered, the solution is not to nerf it, but to buff everything else and hopefully, that's what I've done. Anyways, these being pretty extreme changes, I don't think anything like this will ever get added into the game. It's just fun to imagine sometimes."
727,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[IG] &lt;MAKE PYRO GREAT AGAIN&gt;,59,4axcqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/4axcqh/ig_make_pyro_great_again/,2016-03-18 18:47:52,"As of now, Pyro's metagame is very stale. It's very rare to see a Pyro run anything other than Degreaser/Flare Gun/Powerjack, and the few times a Pyro runs another loadout in comp, it's because they're using the Reserve Shooter or Homewrecker. Many Pyro weapons and playstyles are completely ignored as Pyro is most effective as nothing more than a Spy-checker/spam reflector. The goal with these changes is not to change Pyro fundamentally, but to create more diversity in the Pyro's arsonal^hehe **GENERAL CHANGES** ~~**40% less self-damage taken from reflected projectiles.**~~ ~~**Reflected projectiles have their fuse times reset. (This includes stickybomb arm time)**~~ This gives the airblast greater defensive viability, allowing Pyros to reflect projectile more aggressively without having to worry about taking self-damage. In the case you do take self-damage, it is greatly reduced allowing Pyros to explosive jump with reflected projectiles more commonly. **WEAPON CHANGES** **DEGREASER** ~~**This weapon deploys 60% faster**~~ ~~**This weapon holsters 30% faster**~~ ~~**On extinguish: Gain a speed boost for several seconds**~~ ~~*Does not gain health for extinguishes*~~ ~~*-66% afterburn damage penalty*~~ ~~*+25% airblast cost*~~ These changes leave the Degreaser largely untouched, the only change being the removal of health gain on extinguish and replacing it with added mobility. The Degreaser has always been a flamethrower designed to combo with the Pyro's other weapons and support your team more easily. A speed boost allows the Pyro to cover more ground when playing defensively and counter-attack more effectively after and enemy Pyro's ambush. **BACKBURNER** ~~**+100% crits from behind**~~ ~~**+100% compression blast knockback from behind**~~ ~~*+150% ammo used to airblast*~~ ~~*On extinguish: Returns 25 ammo*~~ ~~*Does not gain health from extinguishes*~~ Another slight change, the Backburner is now more effective as a general ambush tool, this time getting more viability in stopping any opponent you ambush. The increased knockback from behind allows a Pyro to separate Medics from their healing target in a situation you would not have otherwise been able to stop them, even with the criticals. The Backburner has always suffered from being effective in killing enemies who were unaware of your presence and likely would've died to an ambush with stock but less effective at fighting higher health enemies who will simply turn around and kill you before you've dealt much damage. Both of these flamethrower changes give the Stock Flamethrower a sense of uniqueness in that it is the only flamethrower to recover health on an extinguish. **PHLOGISTINATOR** ~~**Build 'Mmmph' by dealing damage.**~~ ~~'Mmmph' builds 50% slower from afterburn.~~ ~~**Alt-fire on full 'Mmmph': Taunt to recover 50HP and gain crits for 10 seconds.**~~ ~~**Invulnerable while 'Mmmph' taunting.**~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~*No airblast*~~ This change brings back the Phlogistinator's health recovery, but in a much weaker form than previously. It can no longer be used to completely recover your health, making Pyros have to plan their ambushes rather than simply running at the enemy team. The slower Mmmph build from afterburn damage also helps to prevent Pyros from gaining health and crits by simply spamming a scorch shot down chokepoints, making Pyros have to work somewhat harder for their damage boost. **MANMELTER** ~~**+50% projectile speed**~~ ~~**Does not require ammo**~~ ~~**Alt-Fire: Extinguish teammates to gain guaranteed critical hits**~~ (You gain your flamethrower's extinguish bonus from this) ~~**Reload: Consume a stored critical hit to gain a speed boost for several seconds.**~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ This Manmelter change gives it increased synergy with the Phlogistinator, allowing you to not only extinguish allies, but grants a speed boost that can be activated with Mmmph to make your ambushes much more dangerous. The Manmelter will also gain the same extinguish bonus as whatever flamethrower you have equipped, allowing a Degreaser Pyro to easily gain a massive boost to mobility when supporting your teammates, or for a Backburner Pyro to recover ammo when yours is depleted. **AXTINGUISHER** ~~**100% critical hits against burning players**~~ ~~**On hit: Damages the enemy for their remaining afterburn damage**~~ ~~*On hit: Extinguishes burning enemies*~~ (You gain your flamethrower's extinguish bonus from this) ~~*-25% damage penalty*~~ ~~*33% slower attack speed*~~ ~~*-75% holster speed*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ This repurposes the Axtinguisher as a 'finisher' weapon. Between the extinguishing on hit, damage penalty and slow holstering speed, not killing an enemy with this weapon will leave you incredibly vulnerable. The trade-off is that it has significantly boosted damage when used with Stock or the Backburner. Since weapon damage is now based partially off of remaining afterburn damage, the Degreaser/Axtinguisher combo is much weaker than it's stock counterpart. This adds a risk/reward element, as an easier to perform combo should not be as effective as a more difficult to pull off combo. **HOMEWRECKER** ~~**+100% damage vs buildings**~~ ~~**+50% resistance to knockback while deployed**~~ ~~**Damage removes Sappers**~~ ~~*-25% damage vs players*~~ A very slight buff, this gives the Homewrecker some reason to use it, even when your team does not have any Engineers. This also makes closing the distance between your team and an enemy sentry easier, as you won't be pushed as far away from it. **POWERJACK** *While deployed:* ~~**15% faster move speed on wearer**~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ ~~**On kill: Gain a speed boost for several seconds**~~ This change removes the out of place health gain on kill and replaces it with a second speed boost. This fits the weapon's playstyle more closely and allows a Pyro to retreat after a kill with it more easily. It is worth mentioning that the Degreaser/Manmelter/Powerjack combo now allows the Pyro to move a ludicrous speeds under specific circumstances. **SHARPENED VOLCANO FRAGMENT** ~~**On hit: Target is engulfed in flames**~~ ~~**While deployed: All afterburn damage is recovered as health**~~ ~~*-50% holster speed*~~ ~~*-25% damage penalty*~~ Another buff to the SVF, this allows a Pyro to recover some extra health during downtime. The slower holstering speed forces a Pyro to be wise about when he has it out, as you're less capable of defending yourself while healing. The regen being based off of afterburn damage also indirectly weakens the Degreaser with this weapon, as the vulnerability the slower holstering speed adds is very much offset by the increased deploying speed. **THIRD DEGREE** ~~**All players connected via Medigun beams are hit**~~ *Damage dealt scales with enemy health* *(minimum damage of 33)* This change gives the Third Degree much higher damage output against 'pocket' classes in exchange for lower damage against lone, weakened enemies. The damage scaling with enemy health means you deal 150% as much damage against fully overhealed enemies, but only half as much damage against enemies with &lt;50% of their health remaining. There is also massively increased synergy with the Phlogistinator, as a critical hit against a fully overhealed enemy with deal 294 damage to both the target and their Medic. The knockback from this hit alone would be enough to mess up an ubercharge without the need for airblasting. (Imagine the kind of damage you could deal to a Kunai Spy!) **Ultimately** I think that these changes would rebalance many of the lesser-used weapons for the Pyro without creating anything too overpowered. As usual, these are just some changes I've come up with for fun and would likely never truly be added into the game."

Switching will also remove any overheal the user currently has before taking the 75 damage*~~ ~~By hitting the reload button while under the weapons effects, the heavy may perform a jump with 160% increased height. This has a cooldown of 3 seconds.~~ Ok so lets be honest, the steak is the most gimmicky weapon in the game. It revolves around making the Heavy a tank to take a huge blunt of damage with his large health pool while dealing big hits up close. But there are various problems with this concept, not only from the games mechanics standpoint, but from the various changes in the game in recent years. First off, with the current steak the heavy only has 240HP given that he takes 25% more damage. This is quite the negative impact for a weapon that is based around tanking damage to take away from the one thing that makes heavy good for rolling melee attacks. On top of this, the weapon is a complete suicide weapon for the heavy with the new changes to the warrior spirit and eviction notice. With the warrior spirit the heavy has 55% damage vunlerability, giving him the equivalent of having 135HP, hardly above the light classes. And then with the Eviction notice, that is 165. Given that he only has 105 move speed, he really does not have the health to endure a direct attack from any class except the spy when closing the gap. And even with the other melees, 240 is less impressive for a melee only to work with to get in and do damage. So because of this, I completely removed the damage vulnerability because it works against the tanking nature of the heavy and of a melee rushdown set. Then there is the issue of time. With the current Steak, the heavy has to waste 4.3 seconds out of the 30 seconds eating his steak while being completely vulnerable. Not only is this painful as is to stand around for 4 seconds not healing or being able to move, but the heavy from the activation of his sandvich takes 25% more damage. So the instant you activate it, you have 240 health to survive on while immobile. Because of that, I made the taunt time (consumption) only 1.72 seconds before he can get out and get into the fight. Then I gave the effects buffs grant the heavy a +3 per second health regeneration for the duration, because if he is truly tanking, he needs to have some sort of buffer to accommodate the massive damage he will be enduring. And seeing how the effects are only 30 seconds long, he would only heal a maximum of 90HP for the entire duration of the weapon. Nothing that would give the heavy too much of an edge, even move time. Then, I gave the heavy the option to be able to switch back to primary if need be, because being locked into melee only can really be frustrating when you come into certain circumstances. Pyros, sentries, scouts, and any explosive class smart enough to jump/blow you back are be nigh impossible to deal with, especially when alert. Currently you have to wait 30 SECONDS for this effect to wear off to take a new approach. I decided to make a change in the same line as the Half-zatoichi and allow you to switch to primary at a price. The damage makes you feel the loss and you can't just instantly return to the action with the primary. Your accuracy will be heavily gimped(which makes sense given the original concept of the weapon being a peyote cactus) and any health you obtain will be diminished for the next 6 seconds, keeping the weapon from being an ideal pocket uber-building tool like the vanilla GRU was. Lastly, I gave the heavy a ""maniac jump"" where he would go into a lounging animation and jump at 150% of the normal jump height as to give him not only power but utility out of the weapon. At 150% the Heavy can crouch-jump slightly above the height of another character, allowing him not only close the gap horizontally but vertically. A heavy could barely brim the lower edge of the 2Fort bridge's lower part and then manage to reach the barracks. It would also allow the heavy some potential flanking attacks or wall hops to get the drop on enemies with his melee. But I make it have a small cooldown so that he could not go full scout and just hop all over the place potentially blurring class lines. so given that, he could only get about 10 of these ""manic jumps"" out in one sitting after eating. So with this the weapon is now a tanking tool as it should be, with some slight utility to mix up the heavies gameplay (as a healer via right-click and a mobile roamer with the manic jump) while still maintaining the original premise of the weapon, and not blurring class lines. So as the saying goes [You don't win friends with Salad!](URL but now you can win rounds with steak! Give me some feedback and tell me what you think."
729,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,"[IG] ""Yet Another 'Let's Fix the Pyro' Post""",0,4bglnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/4bglnn/ig_yet_another_lets_fix_the_pyro_post/,2016-03-22 19:32:27,"Yeah, it's one of those, but I was bored so why not. Fair warning though: this is a long post. Let's start with the class itself: **Pyro** ~~**Increased speed from 100% to 107% (medic speed)**~~ ~~**Reflecting projectiles and extinguishing allies now refunds 80% of the airblast's cost (extinguishing someone would no longer restore 20 health unless specified, but do this instead)**~~ ~~**Deploys and holsters all weapons 40% faster**~~ ~~**The [reverse healer](URL suggestion by /u/AronTimes because it's so goddamn good**~~ ~~*Base airblast cost increased to 50 ammo from 20 ammo*~~ ~~*All Flamethrowers now have a meter. This meter will start to fill after 1 second of constant flamethrower use, filling after 4 seconds. As this meter fills, it lowers your damage by up to 35% and lowers your movement to up to 93% (demo speed)*~~ Yeah, it's a lot of shit. Allow me to explain. * The increased base speed does two things. It alleviates reliance on the Powerjack for movement, allowing for several options for melee weapons. It also adds flavor for the reverse healer idea. * I'll group the increased airblast cost and airblast refund together since they're related. The increased cost discourages using airblast solely to shove people around, which is really annoying in a game where movement is such a monumental factor. But, if we just nerfed airblast, extinguishing and reflecting would also suffer. That's what the refund is for. Plus it also rewards reflecting and extinguishing, which is always good. * The passive switch speed buff has been a thing for a long time. I think 40% is a good number. * /u/AronTimes explains all of the stuff relating to the reverse healer stuff a lot better than I do, so just check out the post if you want an explanation. * The meter heavily discourages W+M1 playstyles while rewarding smart flamethrower use. I made it start at 1 second so you can still melt someone down if you need to, and it capping at 4 seconds seems like a good amount of time. Alright, now that that's over with, let's start with the primaries. **Backburner** ~~**100% critical hits from behind**~~ ~~*-15% flame size*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ Well, I increased the airblast cost for all flamethrowers to 50, so the downside for the backburner is kind of extreme now. I replaced it with -15% flame size to further discourage W+M1. If you're using it for its intended purpose it shouldn't matter too much anyways. The no random crits have always been there, just not added into the description of the weapon, so I rectified that. **Degreaser** ~~**-50% airblast cost**~~ ~~*-30% damage penalty*~~ ~~*-75% afterburn damage penalty*~~ Since all flamethrowers now switch 40% faster, the Degreaser is now the designated airblasting flamethrower. Its upsides are about the same; maybe a little less deployment speed, a little more holster speed. But, it deals significantly less damage, both regular and the afterburn kind. **Phlogistinator** ~~**Does not require ammo**~~ ~~**Build 'Mmmph' by dealing damage**~~ ~~**Taunt with full 'Mmmph': Refill health, 25% damage resistance and mini-crit for several seconds**~~ ~~**Invulnerable and immune to knockback while 'Mmmph' taunting**~~ ~~**Alt-Fire: shoot out an electrical field that vaporizes projectiles**~~ ~~*Deals only 20% damage to buildings*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~*Cannot be crit boosted*~~ I wanted the Phlogistinator to fall in line with the other Grordbort items (specifically the Cow Mangler) so now it has infinite ammo, deals less damage to buildings and cannot be crit boosted. I also restored the health on taunt because the crits got nerfed into damage resistance and mini-crits. I also added a pseudo-airblast that only affects projectiles, much like the Short Circuit, so you have some way of defending yourself with no airblast. Well, there's really only one secondary I wanted to talk about: the Manmelter. **Manmelter** ~~**100% mini-crits vs burning players**~~ ~~**50% projectile speed**~~ ~~**Does not require ammo**~~ ~~**Alt-Fire: Extinguish teammates. Teammates extinguished in this manner restore 20 health**~~ ~~**Teammates extinguished store 'Huddah's. 'Huddah's can be consumed with Reload to gain a speed boost for several seconds**~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~(No longer has the hidden -20% slower firing speed)~~ The idea of crits being consumed for speed boosts has been a popular idea for some time now. I removed the crit-storing entirely because it isn't the best mechanic (Frontier Justice, Diamondback) and simply had it store boosts instead of crits. However, to compensate, I also added mini-crits on burning players. This also relates the Manmelter to the Detonator: The Detonator being used for vertical movement, the Manmelter for horizontal. Moving on to melees. **Axtinguisher** ~~**Mini-crits vs burning players**~~ ~~**On Hit on Burning Target: Deal remaining afterburn damage and extinguish enemy**~~ ~~*This weapon deploys 33% slower*~~ ~~*-50% damage vs non-burning players*~~ Heavily inspired by /u/veidogaems's [post](URL The mini-crit + afterburn damage maims light classes and comes close to one-shotting medics as well. But, after the initial hit, you'll only do 33 damage unless you reignite them again, so you'll want to use it to finish people off rather than just deal damage. It also deploys slower so you want to take them unawares so you don't get shot in the face. **Homewrecker** ~~**While active:**~~ ~~**+100% damage vs buildings**~~ ~~**Damage removes sappers**~~ ~~**-75% push force taken vs sentry guns**~~ ~~*-25% damage vs players*~~ ~~*15% damage vulnerability vs players on wearer*~~ Also shamelessly stolen from /u/veidogaems and subsequently edited. The reduced push force allows you to rush and destroy sentry guns much more effectively without that pesky knockback. But, it doesn't do too much damage and you take more damage from players with it active. You can also still destroy sappers. **Powerjack** ~~**While active:**~~ ~~**75 health restored on kill (can overheal)**~~ ~~*20% slower swing speed*~~ ~~*15% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ The Powerjack is now a melee weapon specialized in finishing weakened targets off, much like the Axtinguisher. However, while the Axtinguisher, it helps you survive rather than dealing massive burst damage. The slower swing speed means you need to carefully time your swings so that you don't miss, otherwise your opponent will have the advantage, especially with the damage vulnerability. **Sharpened Volcano Fragment** ~~**While active:**~~ ~~**On Hit: Target is engulfed in flames**~~ ~~**All afterburn damage done is recovered as health**~~ ~~*This weapon holsters 33% slower*~~ ~~*-30% damage penalty*~~ Yeah, this idea has been floating around in the community for a while as well. Axe someone in the face and bask in the heals. But it doesn't do a lot of damage and holsters slowly, so you'll need to be cautious of when you pull it out. **Third Degree** ~~**Mini-crits overhealed players**~~ ~~**On Hit: Overheal is removed (overheal is removed, then damage is dealt)**~~ ~~**All players connected via Medi Gun beams are hit**~~ ~~*This weapon deploys 33% slower*~~ ~~*20% slower swing speed*~~ Now it's a true Medic hunting weapon that punishes overhealing Medics and their pockets. It carves through any overheal a patient might have before dealing damage and will also damage the medic. However, it deploys slower and swings slower to allow the medic some time to escape. A good idea would be to axe a patient and his medic, then follow up with your Flamethrower to prevent healing. And that's it. If you have any questions, comments or concerns, feel free to voice them down below. I wrote this at 3 in the morning so there might be some errors that I missed or things overlooked. Please remember this though: NUMBERS AREN'T REALLY RELEVANT. They can changed quite easily. It's the ideas that matter."

User can move at stunned rate while eating.**~~ ~~Eat to gain 75 health~~ ~~Recharge time: 12 seconds~~ ~~alt-fire: drop small health kit~~ Dalokohs is supposed to be the roamer heavies best friend. Higher max health and a short recharge time help heavies without medics or other teammates around to stay alert and in the fight, but currently the weapon has some strange properties that are more suited for the full healing sandvich than this. At the moment you have to wait 4.3 seconds to gain your measly 100 health return (assuming you aren't at full health) which is the same as the Sandvich. Being idle while only getting 25 health per second really doesn't work well for the tool that is supposed to be for small but fast heals. Along with this, time is of the essence as almost 5 seconds of your preciously advertised 30 seconds of 350HP status are wasted consuming the chocolate idly. Because of this, I cut the consumption time in half, made it so have could still waddle around while consuming it so he is not completely open. To accommodate for this now shorter window for him to get his health, I decreased the health on consumption to only 75 (37.5 per second during taunt) to decrease the likelihood that heavies could just shrug off a blow completely by eating due to the speed by which they were healing. So essentially its like getting a crusaders crossbow shot on will-call. So with this, roamer heavies now have a quick access tool that can still be used to support and also accommodate fast paced situations. **Warrior Spirit** *Level 10 Gloves* ~~When Weapon is active:~~ ~~**+30% damage bonus**~~ ~~**+50 health restored on kill**~~ ~~*-10% movement speed*~~ ~~*On swing: -10% primary ammo*~~ ~~Unlisted: user can not pick up ammo while weapon is active or 3 seconds afterwards~~ For a weapon called the warriors spirit, its a really weak one for a warrior. The promise of always minicrit damage from base (85) and a good health return on kills is promising, but the negatives are caustic to the heavy in every way possible. 30% vulnerability reduces heavies max health to only 210 while active, making pulling these things out significantly reduce heavies chances of living. On top of that, just like with the PBPP, the concept of pulling out a weapon with the promise of healing that makes your health pool lower from the start is a flawed concept. So because of this, I worked with the idea of the WS being a powerful melee like a lumbering bare with its positive traits, and then shifted the negatives to reflect that. The slower move speed makes the weapon less threatening as the heavy has a harder time closing the gap, and attacking can be a bit of a detriment to the heavy altogether as he loses ammo by attacking. He also can't get ammo for a small window after killing, keeping him from just circumventing the negative after a kill. So now the slow but deadly Siberian bear hands are ready to rip people apart! **The Buffalo Steak Sandvich** *Level 1 Lunch Box* ~~**On consumption: gain Minicrits, 108% move speed, and +3 health per second regeneration while under weapons effects for 30 seconds**~~ ~~**-60% consumption time**~~ ~~*User is restricted melee while under effects.*~~ ~~*Switching to primary while under effects will remove all buffs, deal 75 damage to the user, and make the users heals at -80% with accuracy being decreased by 35% for 6 seconds.

So as the saying goes [You don't win friends with Salad!](URL but now you can win rounds with steak! **Huo-Long Heat Maker** *Level 10 Minigun* ~~**Create a ring of flames while spun up**~~ ~~**+15% damage vs. Burning/Wet enemies**~~ ~~*Consumes an additional 6 ammo per second while spun up*~~ ~~*-25% returns on primary ammo from boxes &amp; dispensers*~~ ~~*-10% damage penalty vs. Non-burning/wet enemies*~~ That the moment the HLH is in a weird place between being a straight upgrade and nearly pointless variant of the stock minigun. On offense in Payload maps the heavy becomes a monster to deal with on the cart and given the easy of obtaining ammo from kills or around the map, the downside of this weapon is only so rarely felt, and only seriously an issue for roamers. Otherwise, it gives the heavy a free ""fuck you"" to spies and demoknights despite doing little to actually stop them (spyicle completely circumvents it, damage reduction after cloak minimizes it, and it honestly do not impede a spy from stabbing, and most demo shields are strong against fire as is). So because of this, I made some modifications to make the HLH more centered around flame gimmick and status damage. IF the heavy ignites someone, they are also more vulnerable to his attack, or if they are on fire or covered in any of the games various liquids, the Heavy is a bigger threat. However under normal circumstances the heavy slightly weaker and wasting ammo faster if the enemy is not under a status. On top of this, the heavy will get less back from ammo boxes for his weapon - small: 30 ammo - medium: 75 ammo - Large: 150 ammo So are you gonna roll in hot and heavy with your team, making people in the sewers sleep with the fishes, wet wannabes wish they were still living, and put hot bullets in burnt bums? Well just don't burn a hole in your wallet, the Triad life ain't easy. **Eviction Notice** *Level 1 Boxing Gloves* ~~**+40% faster firing speed**~~ ~~**Gain a speed boost on hit (95% move speed)**~~ ~~**On critical hit: bleed for 5 seconds**~~ ~~*-65% damage penalty*~~ Until last year, the Eviction Notice was a direct downgrade. The DPS was slightly less than stock. Then they gave it a slight speed movement boost and a speed gimmick to make up for purposely making yourself weaker. And while this was fine, it eventually became sort of a mix between the rushdown of the KGB and the speed of the GRU and was sort of in purgatory. Then they added a damage vulnerabililty to a weapon that does less damage than stock giving the heavy only 240 while active and doing tiny little 26 damage (52 for 2 hits in the same time Stock would do 65) making the weapon just caustic in all situations. With these changes it is still weaker than stock and offer speed boost on hit, but now can take advantage of its multi-hitting attacks with the ability to bleed on crits. See, all melee have a set critical rate of 15% that rises to 60% the closer the user comes to reaching 800 damage in the last 30 seconds. Given that massive amount of damage the heavy puts out, he can have a very high crit change with his melees. This coupled with the EN's ability to throw more punches means more rolls for crits, and the potential to put a bleeding dent in the enemy. Also coupled with the kritzkreig it becomes able to chew through even an overhealed heavy in just 1.6 seconds. So now you can rough em up with the brass knucks. Give me some feedback and tell me what you think."

This change also allows the Heavy to partially spin down his Minigun, while still being able to fire. In case you just need to dodge a crit rocket or want to slightly adjust your positioning while keeping up the pressure. To clarify, the Minigun takes 0.87 seconds to rev and another second for the Damage and Accuracy debuff to fade away. With this change, both the pre-change and post-change Miniguns would have the same Damage after 1.87 seconds, the only change being the ability to fire 0.87 seconds earlier (the Damage and Accuracy would be lower than the standard during this time.) **BRASS BEAST** ~~**+25% firing speed bonus**~~ ~~**+80% resistance to push force while spun up**~~ ~~**+20% damage resistance while revved**~~ ~~*50% slower rev time*~~ ~~*-60% slower move speed while deployed*~~ This change makes the Brass Beast into a more defensive DPS weapon, allowing the Heavy to take and easily hold a position on the map. The resistance to knockback prevents a few rockets or an airblast from pushing the Heavy away from the spot he takes. But with 2.8 seconds before the spread reduces to normal, this only works when the area is clear or enemies are distracted, making your positioning and timing much more important. **NATASCHA** ~~**+200% push force from bullets**~~ ~~**+50% max primary ammo on wearer**~~ ~~**+20% damage resistance while revved**~~ ~~*-25% damage penalty*~~ ~~*30% slower spin up time*~~ remove stun This change turns the annoying 'Slow on hit' feature into a more sensible increased knockback. Great for denying ambush classes like Soldier, Demoknights or Scouts, though the decreased damage and knockback won't do much for finishing off enemies and will likely assist in letting them escape. However, the increased knockback will easily allow a Heavy to lock an out-of-position enemy into a corner where escape is unlikely. **BUFFALO STEAK SANDVICH** *While under the effects, move speed is increased 35%, attacks mini-crit, user is marked for death for 15 seconds* *Move speed and mini-crits removed when switching away from melee* ~~*Marked for death effect remains for the full 15 seconds*~~ ~~**Alt-fire: Share with a friend (Small Health Kit, increases move speed for several seconds)**~~ This change turns the BSS into a more supportive weapon, allowing the Heavy to grant an ally a speed boost, great for assisting a Medic in an escape or helping an ally out before an ambush. It also grants a slight buff in allowing the Heavy to switch away from his melee weapon under the influence, though this will also remove the mini-crits and speed boost, leaving him with the 'Marked for Death' debuff. (Though it's also worth noting that, since the Heavy will no longer be under the effects of the BSS, the Marked for Death status can be removed with a dispenser or Medigun like any other debuff after switching away). **DALOKOH'S BAR** ~~**Adds +50 max health for 30 seconds**~~ ~~**Alt-Fire: Share a snack with a friend (Small health kit)**~~ ~~**Or throw your chocolate on the floor and eat the chocolate off of the floor like a animal.**~~ This is a slight buff, allowing the Heavy to eat his own dropped Dalokoh's bar, granting him a bit of extra health while moving forwards or retreating. **FAMILY BUSINESS** ~~**While Deployed: Gain a movement and deploy speed boost when a teammate that recently scored an assist with you dies**~~ ~~**Mini-crits the target that initiated the speed boost**~~ ~~*-15% damage*~~ Keeping with the 'family' theme, this weapon allows a Heavy to avenge his fallen comrades. The revenge crits are great for finishing off a Spy or Soldier shortly after they've taken out your Medic, preventing them from escaping the Heavy's revenge-killing spree. **EVICTION NOTICE** ~~**+60% faster deploy speed**~~ *When weapon is active:* ~~**+40% faster firing speed**~~ ~~**On hit: Matches speed with a faster enemy**~~ ~~*-60% damage penalty*~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ With the speed boost granted to the Heavy at the top of this page, the Eviction Notice's speed buff becomes unnecessary without also buffing the GRU to an absurd length as well. This change matches the Family Business' speed buff as part of the set, and helps a Heavy to defend himself in an instance where his Minigun isn't the best choice. **FISTS OF STEEL** ~~**-40% damage from ranged sources while active**~~ ~~**Punches can destroy projectiles**~~ ~~*-20% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*+100% damage from melee sources while active*~~ ~~*This weapon holsters 100% slower*~~ A simple buff to the Fists of Steel, this allows a Heavy to completely negate the effects of a projectile by timing a punch against it. The slower firing speed prevents this ability from being spammed. **GLOVES OF RUNNING URGENTLY** *While deployed:* ~~**+15% faster move speed on wearer**~~ ~~*-25% damage penalty*~~ ~~*Drains up to 12 Health per second on wearer*~~ ~~*This weapon holsters 50% slower*~~ With the increased movement speed granted to the Heavy, the speed boost on the GRU had to be lowered to balance the movement speed between classes. With the 'nerf' to this weapon, I decided it would be best to remove some of the recent nerfs the G.R.U. has received, including bringing back the health drain on wearer, this time working like the other passive health regen changes. The G.R.U. will drain 12 health per second on wearer immediately after taking damage, but this will lower to 6 HP/sec over 10 seconds of not taking any damage. **KILLING GLOVES OF BOXING** ~~**On Kill: 8 seconds of mini-crits**~~ ~~**Crits when it would normally mini-crit**~~ ~~*50% slower deploy speed*~~ ~~*-20% slower firing speed*~~ Previously, the Heavy never had much time to switch to another weapon after gaining crits with the G.R.U. This change allows the Heavy to take more advantage of his new damage boost, even if there are no enemies within the immediate area who aren't already running away from him. The slower deploy speed makes it harder for a Heavy to defend himself while he has the KGB equipped, forcing him to use them more offensively. **WARRIOR'S SPIRIT** ~~**On hit: Grants 40% ranged damage resistance from the enemy you hit until this weapon is holstered.**~~ ~~**+30% damage to enemies with melee weapons deployed**~~ ~~*30% melee damage vulnerability*~~ ~~**Recover 50 health on kill**~~ ~~*When killed by a Melee weapon: Grants 50 health to the player who killed you*~~ &gt; ""Come; we fight like men."" This change repurposes the Warrior's Spirit as a Melee Dueling weapon helping the Heavy survive against enemies who shoot him and encouraging them to fight him with their own melee weapons. It's not really a 'useful' change as closing the distance to an enemy and hitting them in melee as Heavy is difficult, but it does make the weapon fun to use, and that's really all that matters. "

Subclasses, like the Demoknight or Combo-Pyro, add a lot to the gameplay in my opinion - they bring in variety and a degree of unexpectability (is that a word?). Therefore, I'd personally welcome the addition of more of them - and one of those would be turning the Sniper into a Ranger-type deal. The reason for this is that so far, the Huntsman isn't really viable, and most people simply spam groups of enemies at a mid-long range with it, hoping for an occasional headshot (""Lucksman""). I'd like to bring the Sniper closer to his enemies, allowing him to actually lead his shots, thus increasing his skill ceiling. Those of you who've read fantasy books, especially Tolkien, or played RPGs probably already know what I mean. I'd like to make the Huntsman-Sniper faster, more precise, but also much more punishable in his mistakes with the addition of the following two items: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^a ***Quivering Quiver*** (yes, I know, it's a crappy name so far) * Increases primary ammo by 50% * Increases movement speed and jump height by somewhere around 15% * Decreases health by 25 * Increases fire vulnerability by ~25% * Burns down if it comes in contact with fire (comes back after a cooldown. Once it's burned down, only it's negative effects stay) At first, I thought about adding those stats to the Huntsman itself, but the SMG might be too powerful in combination with them, which is why I think a secondary would be better. Essentially, those changes allow the Sniper to be much more mobile and allow him to dodge more, but also heavily punish taking damage - especially from fire, since Pyros are much easier to avoid at increased speeds. He'll have to rely more on health kits (which are more easily accessible at higher speeds), but will also be able to aim his shots more easily. The recent addition of the ability to charge and fire arrows while jumping also makes the +15% jump height much more interesting. I've also thought of a melee weapon to go with the set: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^a ***Survivor's Knife*** (another name that probably isn't here to stay) * Swing speed increased by 10% * Allows for minicrits on backstabs * Damage decreased by 15% Would probably look like one of [those](URL Haven't thought much about the addition of this item yet (feedback is very welcome), but essentially, it'd make ambushing (especially already hurt) enemies from behind more rewarding, which goes well with the increased mobility of the Quivering Quiver - however, it's also more lacking in direct combat. Essentially, you'd use it to ambush an enemy by shanking them 1-2 times from behind, then running away again and waiting for your next opportunity. Not as viable on small maps, but it sounds like fun to play around with. Of course, these are only my ideas. What do you guys think? Would Sniper work as a Ranger-subclass, do you like the weapon stats, do you have ideas for things that might work better? I'm excited to read your feedback!"

Everyone uses it for the cloak duration and not the cloak on hit, so that attribute can safely be removed. The new downside I have introduced isn't too bad; it simply negates the Gun Mettle buff of 20% damage resistance while cloaking. For the Dead Ringer, the initial strike's damage will still be reduced by 75% (since the Spy has not yet cloaked), but subsequent strikes will be affected by the damage vulnerability."

Instead, have it support the team better by giving *them* health; it helps their longevity, especially needed in group fights. (This would instead be the only bonus) As an added bonus to it, maybe there should be a slight or full ammo return to the Pyro for the extinguish, that way it costs you even less to help your team. ----------------------------------------- **Afterburn receives a damage reduction, and in turn, gives a damage vulnerability to damage from other, non-Fire damage sources** Part of filling a support role means doing better in group fights, while having a tougher time 1v1. Engies with low-Sentry-mobility but helpful Teleporters, Medics with hard to aim syringes, but Invincibility with an Ubercharge, Snipers picking off important targets with tunnel vision to everything else, and Spies with sneakiness countered by awareness, in turn countered by waiting for your team to distract them. Pyro should therefore have lower 1v1 potential than Scout or Soldier, but great group fight potential, letting your team finish off burning targets easier. The bit about non-Fire damage is to prevent potential Pyro spam, thus negating the damage reduction, but it should still promote combos, since they're considered part of skilled Pyro play. Naturally direct flame damage would likely need to go back to pre-Tough-Break damage falloff calculation. I don't know. But at least some work would need to be done on correcting particle behavior and visualization to feel less wonky and potentially unfairly misleading. Please do think of changes or other suggestions if you decide to critique."

It's probably not original but I'd like to see an afterburn and/or multi-target focused flamethrower for pyro. I'm thinking the current stats need to have another downside but I'm not sure what it should be. Also I've thought this might make a good passive secondary if a flair gun proves to be too powerful with the present bonuses. here's a damage chart. 1 Enemy on fire: 6 damage per sec, 60 total damage (same as stock) 2 Enemies on fire: 8 damage per sec, 80 total damage 3 Enemies on fire: 10 damage per sec, 100 total damage 4 Enemies on fire: 12 damage per sec, 120 total damage 5 Enemies on fire: 14 damage per sec, 140 total damage The wildfire rewards the pyro for ambushing large groups of players, transforming afterburn damage into a force to be reckoned with. While this weapon gives pyro new crowd clearing power it does turn enemy pyros into a hard counter, since they don't take afterburner damage and are able to extinguish fire, with the added damage bonus as well. This would promote a more aggressive playstyle for pyro while also promoting the support playstyle to react to it."

Weapons, at their core, change damage, health, utility, or mobility in some direct or indirect way. Sometimes all four are changed, but in most cases one attribute is augmented while another is hindered. The Soda Popper violates this by boosting Damage and Mobility with no downside in Utility or Health. Here is my fix to that: ~~*User cannot be overhealed*~~ Restricting the user to 125 maximum health creates a powerful risk to using this weapon. If you cannot capitalize on the positives, then you will be left very vulnerable. That 60 extra health goes a long way over the course of a match. While not a perfect fix, it's certainly a step in the right direction. Damage vulnerability of some kind, to me, would devalue the weapon beyond viability, even given the upsides. However, left alone it is undoubtedly OP and strictly better than stock. "

These ideas are completely based off of competitive, not pubs. The Solemn Vow/ Bonesaw: -------------------------------- I think that the bonesaw should be buffed so you are able to read enemy health like the Solemn vow. Then revert the solemn vow's swing speed nerf, leaving it a RESKIN. This should now give a bit more of a reason to use the bonesaw. The Diamondback: -------------------------- I think the base damage should be lowered to 30 a shot, so that the crits that you earn through backstabs and sapping do 90 damage, so its very much possible to 2 shot 125-175 health classes but no longer allow for 2 shot to a soldier or 3 shots to a heavy. I thought that the ambassador should receive this nerf as well, but earning headshots are much more difficult and the decay time slows down the rate at which you can headshot significantly making it a much harder and skillful weapon to use in comparison to simply earning them through backstabbing or sapping. This should give more incentive to use the stock revolver or if you really want consistent -105 damage, use the amby. Machina: ------------ In a competitive scenario, the noscoping removed isn't much of a nerf. The extra damage upon being fully charged is a direct upgrade. I think this weapon's base damage should be increased to 60. (Will be able to 3 shot body shot demo's and pyro's) -15% or 20% charge rate. Still be able to penetrate players. Maybe make noscoping to 30 or 40 damage? The Classic: --------------- Take away body shot damage penalty. Increase the charge 10% to give this gun a reason to be used beside being able to charge unscoped. Stock SMG: -------------- Increase the base damage to 10. It sucks for the most part compared to these useful backpacks. Lower the spread too. Its a rng canon. Darwins Danger Shield: ---------------------------- Take away bullet resistance and explosive vulnerability. Keep +25 health on wearer. Right now the strongest backpack is the cozy camper, and the razorback is very common in highlander. I don't really understand what play style they are trying to encourage with the DD, the increase in health and bullet resistance suggests to be a more aggressive and beefier sniper, but at the same time you are much more susceptible to explosives. Which should hold you back. This change should encourage an all around more aggressive and mobile play style. Pomson 6000: ------------------- The engineer has no business removing uber from a medic. Take the feature away. Keep the decrease of clock on hit however. Increase the particle speed. (I don't know how much would be balanced) Take away the infinite ammo property, its stupid and encourages spam. Increase the base damage to 50 instead of 48. The panick attack ---------------------- Its still gimmicky even with its recent buff. Take away the spread on lower health. Maybe then it will be useful. That's all I have, I can't wait to see this game grow in the esports catagory."

Engineers with the Stockpile will spawn with 200 max metal as they normally do, however, they may continue collecting metal, up to 300. Reserved metal will be used up first prior to using up the metal supply. Ammo kits do not give more metal, for your max metal supply is not increased. The Stockpile also provides a few negative effects: All reserved metal is lost on death, you cannot receive metal with broken building parts, and a 20% damage vulnerability. On a side note, the metal regen upgrade in MVM does NOT increase reserved metal supply. **Blueprint Director** *Secondary Wrangler* ~~**This weapon deploys 30% faster**~~ ~~**When Activated: Creates a shield that absorbs all incoming damage on your sentry gun**~~ ~~Shield can absorb up to 50% of the sentry's health~~ ~~Shield breaks once max damage is absorbed~~ ~~**Sentry becomes active instantly after shield is broken**~~ ~~*No fire rate bonus on wrangled sentry*~~ This engineer wrangler takes away from the offensive side and gives a little extra mmmph. You lose the extra firing speed on a wrangled sentry to make it completely invulnerable for a short time. The amount of absorbed damage is based on the level of the sentry (Level 1 absorbs 75 damage; Level 2 absorbs 90 damage; Level 3 absorbs 105 damage). If done correctly, the engineer can proc the shield off several times, making the sentry take very little damage. To do so, the engineer must switch weapons during the time the shield is up and then switch back to the weapon (which deploys 30% faster) right as the shield breaks. The normal wrangler increases a sentries health by x3 while it is wrangled keep in mind. **End Receiver** *Melee Wrench* ~~**Ammo packs give 25% more metal**~~ ~~**Can collect an extra 10 metal from dispensers**~~ ~~*-20% decreased healing rate from health pack and dispenser sources*~~ This engineer wrench increases you metal pickup rate, in exchange for a decreased healing rate. Ammo boxes will give you a bonus 25% metal (except large ammo boxes which already fill you metal supply). A small ammo kit will give you 50 (instead of 40) metal and a medium ammo kit will give you 125 metal (instead of 100). Metal taken from dispensers is increased by 10 with each level of the dispenser. Keep in mind that this does not increases how fast a dispenser generates metal. A level 1 dispenser will still generate only 40 metal at a time and increases by 10 with each level. This would be a good wrench to use if you are having a hard time getting metal, and are not in danger a lot. **Metal Project Maker** *Engineer Construction PDA* ~~**Building costs are reduced by 40 metal**~~ ~~**Buildings construct as if being hit with your current wrench**~~ ~~*50 less max metal*~~ This engineer construction PDA is both beneficial and harmful to you and your fellow engineers. The 50 less max metal is a devastating blow to the engineer. However, the smaller building costs compensate for this loss. With all building costs reduced by 40 (Sentry Cost is 90, Dispenser Cost is 60, Teleporter Costs are 85 each) you are able to build both a sentry and a dispenser instantly right after the other, which you cannot do with stock (Also a dispenser and a single teleporter). There is also a construction speed bonus, depending on which wrench you are using. This compliments quick setups as you have multiple buildings constructing at once, rather than building one at a time. At the same time you are upgrading slower due to the lack of max metal. **Synergy** *(as suggested by Ajsandved)* These new updated stats will provide engineers efficiency, but at the same time make them easier to kill. The reserved metal from the Stockpile compliments the Metal Project Maker's huge downside of decreased max metal supply and the End Receiver's extra metal on ammo packs. Of these 3 weapons are used together, you will have a max metal supply of 150 (and 100 metal reserve), making small kits give 40 metal, medium kits give 95 metal, and large ammo kits give 185 metal (all rounded). The large ammo kits will fill your metal supply to 150 and 35 metal will go into the reserved metal. Maximum metal will be 250 total, making constructing buildings much easier since they cost 40 metal less EACH. In fact you can build your teleporter entrance, continue moving into the battlefronts, grab a ammo kits on your way to the battlefront, build all the rest of your buildings, and have more time to upgrade without needing to go back to your resupply closet!

Sorry if this breaks the sub's rules.] Anyone who's played pyro for more than 10 hours knows that the powerjack is the best melee, and it's the most used melee, with 42% of people that own the powerjack equipping it (according to TF2stats.net). But why? Why is the powerjack so overused, and why are weapons like the backscratcher so underused? The answer is actually very simple: speed. The powerjack gives pyro speed, and none of the other melees do so. That's it. Think about it for a sec: pyro has the shortest range out of all the classes, so anything that increases his terrible mobility is a godsend. Who cares if the backscratcher gives extra health from packs? It's not gonna help if you're trying to close the gap between you and the enemy. It's not gonna help you on rollouts. It's not gonna help you while retreating. The powerjack's speed automatically makes it 10 times better than the other melees. This is why the nerf to the powerjack's health on kill during gun mettle changed nothing about the weapon's use: people use it for the speed, not for the health on kill. So if the powerjack will always be the best melee as long as it has the speed, then what can we do to encourage more variety with the pyro's tertiary slot? If you read the title, then you know exactly what I'm suggesting: **-All pyro melees now allow the pyro to move at 115% speed while active** This very basic change is all that is needed to fix the pyro melee conundrum. Now all melees have access to that sweet, sweet speed, putting all of them at the same level of the powerjack. Now choosing between the axtinguisher and the backscratcher isn't just choosing between the least bad weapon (although the ax definitely needs a buff, but that's a topic for another day); you aren't forced into the powerjack every time you play pyro. In fact, the axtinguisher could actually be reverted back to its state before tough break and not be complete trash, because the problem with that iteration of the ax was that you were getting a pretty small damage boost while giving up speed, but with this change, you would no longer be giving up the speed. This change may even make people use the fire axe/third degree if you just want the speed and no fancy stats. But now that the speed is passive to all melees, what should we do with the powerjack? Well, I think it should be similar to how it when it originally came out: THE POWERJACK - ~~**On kill: restore 75 health and gain a speed boost for 3 seconds**~~ - ~~*20% damage vulnerability while active*~~ Now the powerjack is not the ubiquitous choice, but a gimmicky, fun side grade that allows you to go on hammertime rampages if you get a kill with it. In the end, this simple change would give pyro some much needed mobility, without making it OP (since you only gain the speed while the melee is active, so it doesn't really encourage w m1). What do you guys think of this idea? Is it exactly what we need? Or could it use some tweaking? Please share your thoughts down below. **TL;DR: Make faster speed a passive on the pyro melees, and put the powerjack's focus on its ""on kill"" stats.** EDIT: I've decided to add another stat to my idea: **All pyro melees now have 20% damage vulnerability while they are active** This way, you have to be smart about where you take out your melee. Hopefully this will make the extra speed balanced. Thanks to /u/Lovuur for the idea. "

If you have your primary weapon out, DDS will stop making you bullet-resistant, because you are both capable of headshotting and being headshot.

Thus, this allows you to move around to attempt to reach a Health pack, or go for a new angle to snipe at your enemy from, before dying. This would make Sniper battles less static. As soon as you pull out your primary, you will lose the resistances again. Thus, the 0.5 second weapon switching delay and 0.2 second scoping in delay would help prevent people from abusing the second-scoping tactic, as it would leave them briefly vulnerable to the other Sniper. So, this would change DDS from ""win Sniper duels and be tankier"" to ""Allows you to get into position to snipe people without instantly dying"". A real 'danger' shield for dangerous situations. Finally, the explosive damage vulnerability would be removed, in exchange for the nerf."

This obviously won't be viable on offence due to the need to constantly push forward and gain new vantage points. However, on defence, this would be an alternative to the razorback for increased ability to hold angles, especially against an enemy sniper not using the Danger Shield. This opens up the opportunity for spies to easily take out the sniper, given an opening, since the wearer cannot headshot under half charge, which increases the need to hardscope with this on. Additionally, this increases the synergy with the piss rifle, due to it's increased charge speed, and inability to headshot anyways. The explosive damage vulnerability was also lowered to make the ehp of the sniper above base hp (135 no overheal).

This is my long-thought-through attempt to balance the Pyro's weapon selections AND balance it in comparison to other classes, and probably the two hundredth attempt you've seen at balancing it. However, I'm really confident that I've got a good thing going here, and I decided to follow my dreams and present it to you. **Afterburn (All Flamethrowers)** ~~Takes 3 seconds for heal beams to extinguish (previously 1)~~ A buff to the poor old easily countered mechanic that is afterburn. Flamethrower's afterburn advantage over Degreaser becomes just a little more important. **Axtinguisher** ~~**100% critical hits on burning enemies from behind**~~ ~~**Mini-crits burning enemies from the front**~~ ~~*50% less damage on non-burning enemies*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ Love and War Axtinguisher, while not the best weapon ever, was a balanced sidegrade to stock in a way similar to the Ambassador/Revolver relationship for Spy. If you were a bad Pyro it wasn't great, but if you were a good Pyro, like Sketchkek, you could get great results out of it by playing stealthily. But after Tough Break, Axtinguisher became trash. It has less damage now than simply spraying W+M1. It needs to be fixed. **Backburner** ~~**100% critical hits from behind**~~ ~~**50% less self-damage from blast jumping**~~ ~~*150% airblast cost*~~ The Backburner is widely maligned as a Pyro option because the airblast cost is so harsh, it's not Degreaser, and Pyro lacks tools to help it get behind people to crit them. Making it into the ""Gunboats of Pyro"" will hopefully make it popular with players of all skill levels for an ambushing playstyle, giving Pyro increased mobility and a lower HP cost to reach ambush and flank routes when paired with the Detonator, Scorch Shot, or reflected enemy projectiles. [Det jump cost goes from 34HP per jump to 16HP per jump]. **Degreaser** It's bugged to provide less switch speed than it advertises. Please fix it, Valve. With these changes to the other Flamethrowers, plus the nerfs Valve gave to Degreaser, it should be absolutely balanced now. Stock is the ""airblasting/afterburn"" primary, Degreaser is the ""damage combo"" primary, Backburner is the ""afterburn/mobility"" primary, and Phlogistinator is the ""ambush/flare harass/sustain"" primary. **Phlogistinator** ~~**After dealing 300 fire damage, taunt to refill health and gain crit for several seconds.**~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~*No airblast*~~ ~~*User cannot be locked onto by Mediguns during MMMPH*~~ This makes Phlog a bit less of a pub-stompy spawncampy weapon, as you cannot have crits AND Uber at the same time. Restoring the heal Valve took away from it, on the other hand, will make it viable when you don't have a Medic to pocket you. My inspiration for this particular change was this, as well as multiple instances of seeing similar results in pubs: URL **Powerjack** ~~**+15% faster move speed while active**~~ ~~**+25 health restored on kill**~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability while active*~~ ~~*50% less carried secondary ammunition on user*~~ Powerjack is basically the undisputed king of Pyro melees. With this nerf, if you decide to take the strong speed/heal that is the Powerjack, you also have to accept the cost of only having 8 flares at a time or only 19 shotgun slugs, similarly to how the Backburner only grants 4 airblasts. With the new ""Backburner is Pyro Gunboats"" buff, this also means that if you want to be a supremely mobile Backburner-Detonator-Powerjack pyro who can rocket jump and travel at 115% speed, you only get 4 airblasts and 8 flares. Thus, Pyro can experience great ambushing mobility, but at a cost to damage, spamming, and airblasting. Furthermore, this gives people a reason to use the Manmelter with Powerjack for the unlimited ammo. It all links together. **Razorback** ~~**Manually activate to block backstab attempts for 25 seconds (15 second recharge) and gain a small speed boost**~~ Razorback is a replacement for a good spychecking Pyro; and as we've seen from high-level Highlander, it's way too strong at that role. If Razorback is reworked so that Spies can properly counter Sniper, then Pyro becomes more important for his ability to counter Spy. Thus, reworking the Razorback will have beneficial flow-on effects for Pyro as a class, and game balance as a whole. This rework changes the Razorback to give Spies a window of opportunity to attack their targets. **Sharpened Volcano Fragment** ~~**100% of afterburn damage dealt by this weapon is returned as healing**~~ ~~**Ignites target on hit**~~ ~~*45% damage penalty*~~ An attempt to make the SVF worth swapping to. Hit three people, then bask in your newfound 9hp regen/sec. Also synergises nicely with the Degreaser's reduced afterburn. Damage penalty increase balances the buff a bit. **Third Degree** ~~**Mini-crits targets connected by heal beams**~~ ~~**Cauterizes bleeding allies on hit (restores 20HP)**~~ ~~*+100% damage from melee sources on wearer*~~ Fairly simple, furthers the niche of the weapon, while also introducing a minor counter to bleed [which nothing but heal beams and HP packs currently prevent]. You kill a Medic [and maybe his heal target] in 2 hits instead of 3+3; but if he sees you, he can swap to melee and kill you in 1 hit."

Not sure if I tagged this correctly. Basically, I was playing Sniper on a bad trade server, and my thought process was basically that Darwin's Danger Shield is used by new or high-ping players purely so they can get into position without dying as soon as they get out of spawn; it gives them a chance. So what if the DDS was only an asset while trying to get into position? And I thought that, while terrible for balance in regard to an even Sniper v. Sniper fight, that design actually had merit as a sort of survival-crutch for letting Snipers at least see some of the map before they get killed by the Australium ""aimbot.exe"". So I decided the best way to do that would be to give it the bonuses while moving, but remove the bonuses while scoped in. While you're not a threat to distant Snipers [unscoped] the DDS provides you nothing but a minor HP benefit. As soon as you're in position to be a threat, however, you lose that protection. On the other hand, the much-maligned Classic would still continue to receive the same benefits from the Darwin's Danger Shield as it already does if you fire it while your scope is down. So this would give people a reason to use the Classic. This is still balanced because in a situation where one player is using the Classic+DDS and one player is using stock, both of them need a full charge in order to headshot the other."

I haven't posted here before but I wanted people to comment on this idea I had. Please feel free to criticize as you see fit, since this is my first submission and I'm tackling a difficult class to make weapons for. Any smart TF2 player will tell you to kill the other team's Medic first. They're the most important part of any team, both on offense and on defense. The Medic role is to be the class which supports his teammates, controls the flow of the fight and can make or break a push. The basic concept I had for this weapon was, ""what if they made the Medic's role a bit more extreme?"" Regardless of Medigun chosen, the Medic who has the Referred Pain equipped will charge their Uber 10% faster than the Medigun's standard rate. This will allow them to get their Uber of choice more quickly by doing their job of keeping their teammates alive. On that topic, by letting whoever he is healing have a higher resistance to all damage types, the Medic can build charge even more easily by keeping his team around longer (with maximum overheal, a stock Heavy will have an effective 518 health when being pocketed- pretty scary stuff). Finally, by letting the Medic move more quickly while healing a teammate with the Referred Pain equipped, he will be able to both get to the front line faster with his teammates to assist with a push, as well as be able to dodge enemy fire more easily when under attack. However (while not necessarily true right now), there's supposed to be no such thing as a direct upgrade in TF2, and this weapon was designed with that in mind. The biggest downside, of course, is that while the Medic with this weapon equipped will be able to both build Uber faster and keep his teammates alive longer, the Medic himself has been made more vulnerable in order to ensure players don't feel helpless when facing a team with a good enemy Medic. By lowering the Medic's resistance to all damage types (making his max health effectively 128 instead of 150), the Medic must be extremely aware of his surroundings. A standard Rocket can potentially deal a maximum of 112 damage, which while not a one-hit kill is certainly enough to make the Medic crap his pants. The Medic with this weapon equipped will be able to outmaneuver his opponents if he's careful, for sure, however should he lose his heal target in a fight, the 30% slower firing speed on this Syringe Gun will make it hard for the Medic to defend himself. Finally, to prevent Medics from healing with this weapon equipped, then swapping off to another primary after getting their quick Uber, the Uber-halving penalty was added. That way, a Medic will not be able to take advantage of the upsides of this weapon without having to deal with any downsides. The Medic who uses this weapon is faced with a more extreme version of the playstyle of the stock Medic. If you equip the Referred Pain, you will be able to really crank out the Ubers your team needs and keep your team in the fight much longer than a normal Medic. However, you're foregoing the safety of that extra 22 health to do so, and you're also putting yourself more at risk by enticing opposing players to kill you first. Furthermore, a Medic with the Referred Pain equipped must be able to judge a situation very quickly- with all the upsides and downsides mentioned above about damage resistance and movement speed, an important thing to remember is that that all only applies if the Medic is healing a teammate. If a Medic isn't healing a teammate, he'll move as fast as a normal Medic and take as much damage as one too. A Medic with the Referred Pain equipped must know when to stay and fight (can I keep my teammate alive right now?) as well as when to flee when he has the chance (can I make it if I leave?). Please feel free to let me know what you think. "

Since Pyros are so ludicrously rare in 6s yet common in pubs and mandatory in HL, a weapon with its main weakness being the Pyro would make the weak-against-skilled-players Spy comparatively useful in 6s by skilled players, while not overpowered against weaker players. And even with the greatly increased weakness to fire, the speed increase would still make this a situationally useful weapon in pub games/HL where Pyros still make common appearances, for reaching Snipers or fast traveling to the frontline. Of course, in order to prevent Sanic-speed Spies boosting around the map getting backstabs, the weapon forces you to drop your disguise before attacking- losing the speed boost, and thus moving as fast as any other Spy. Depending on how close you choose to drop your disguise, you may also alert the enemy with your sound. You can pass through enemies, although it does not let you stand inside them; the same collision rules apply as if you were on their team. Finally, the weapon also removes your ability to place Sappers while disguised; while your Sappers still remain useful, as you can slap down a Sapper as soon as you come out of disguise, it still gives the Engineer in question fair warning. This downside means little in 6s, but helps balance the weapon for pub and HL play. H8 and R8 fellas. Edit- Thanks Yobleck for pointing this out so I can clarify: You must wait for a brief period after undisguising to attack. "

Phlog, Manmelter, and Third Degree",5,3xoscj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/3xoscj/ig_remaking_grordbort_moonman_pack_weapon_set/,2015-12-21 21:22:31,"Ladies and gentlemen Sile Animus here bringing another smack down of a weapon rebalance for you all to see. Today we will be seeing the classic Grordbort Pyro set, this includes the Third Degree, Manmelter, and, as you are all waiting to see, the Phlogistinator. Forget EVERYTHING you think you know or you know you don't know about any of these weapons because they are going to be reworked so hard it'll put the invention of rocket jumping to shame. And I mean FORGET EVERYTHING. Not a single one of the previous statistics for the weapons will matter here unless mentioned otherwise. Everything else is gone, it's all fair game. Now let's get to it. ---- I'll put it straight. The current incarnation of the Phlogistinator simply does not work on any level of design or balance. Like the Gunslinger, the weapon is flawed at it's core, any buffs to it make it annoying to fight against, and any nerfs to it make it as useless as the Sharpened Volcano Fragment. If something is broken so much that it's practically scrap, then it's time to entirely remake it into something brand-spanking shiny and new. **PHLOGISTINATOR** ~~**Reflecting in-air projectiles adds 25 to Mmmph meter**~~ ~~**Extinguishing allies adds 40 to Mmmph meter**~~ ~~**On full Mmmph: Pressing reload grants 8 seconds of mini-crits and healing at 26hp/s**~~ ~~*+100% airblast cost*~~ ~~Mmmph meter takes 225 points to fill up~~ Now this remake of the weapon will give any skillful Pyro a good creaming in the flank. The entire point of the phlogistinator that exists now is to grant a massive boost to flanking ability while at the downside of being vulnerable most of the time. That just doesn't quite cut it in-game. For one, Pyro as a whole can't really use flank routes as well as Scout, Soldier, or Spy, as all three of those classes have some form of mobility boost. The Pyro does have the Detonator and Scorch Shot for mobility. But neither of those weapons are part of the Moonman Pack set. So let's focus on making the weapons of the set work with each other then? For one, the full crit and full healing aspect is removed and remade into mini-crits and continuous healing (at the same rate as a Medigun's base healing). Full-on crits have shown to be far too powerful as a whole when trying to attack enemies, as the sheer damage output melts anything in it's path. While a full-burst heal is frustrating to fight against as it negates all previous combat on the opponents side. Originally, to compensate, the Pyro was made immobile by taunting, and as such needed resistances to compensate for this vulnerability. But that is not useful anymore, as neither of the upsides are so ridiculously powerful that they need even more downsides. As the healing is now continuous instead of instant, the Pyro becomes far more durable in surviving combat itself (imagine if you could always run around with your own pocket medic?), because of this, the mini-crits become far more powerful than they would have been otherwise. But since stable healing can be outdone by burst damage itself, the Pyro will have to consider when and where to activate this boost. This individual powerhouse of a boost does not come without it's requirements. Similarly to the Black Box, Blutsauger, or most other self-sustain based abilities, there needs a downside that applies to the Pyro's relation with the team as a whole. Thus, the requirement to fill the Mmmph are changed from merely dealing damage to actually helping out your team. By making it so that you build Mmmph by extinguishing allies, the Pyro is rewarded with the new +20 health AND a good boost to the Mmmph meter. But since Pyros are not always present on the enemy team, there has to be some other way to help. And what other helpful skill does Pyro have other than reflecting projectiles away? That makes it a perfect candidate to give a moderate fill to the meter. But since so much is rewarded from airblasting, there has to be a cost. Similarly to the Backburner, this Phlog is a flanking based weapon. By having a cost to airblast higher than normal, the Pyro must be tactical in when and where to airblast. It no longer becomes a spammable ability that you can throw out on a whim, but an actual tool that you need to consider whether or not to use. ---- The next runner up has been crippled by a classic case of misguided life choices. But we don't judge here of course, after all, who hasn't screwed up once in their lives? But as the good natured people we are, we are going to fix this little baby up to be a formidable force of power and... well, power. So bring it up for this entirely renewed son of the Flare Gun, the **Manmelter** ~~**Builds meter with fire damage dealt**~~ ~~**On full meter: Alt-fire to grant +50% firing speed for 4 seconds**~~ ~~**+50% firing speed**~~ ~~**Afterburn from multiple flares stack**~~ ~~*-33% afterburn duration*~~ ~~*-50% damage*~~ ~~Meter takes 500 damage to fill~~ Mmm, Mmm, Mmmmm, now look at this sweet little powerhouse of indivisible particle smashes. And a what a particle smasher it is! The old Manmelter tried to do what a primary Flamethrower does, extinguish allies. But now that the Phlogistinator has gotten that ability, this gun needs a new purpose. The Phlogistinator itself serves as a handy dandy short-range melting stick, but lacks the ability to make long-range damage reliably, especially with that airblast downside. So why not turn this smasher into a true long-range banger? Like the other Flareguns, the Manmelter serves to have a purpose for Pyro's distance combat department. But this version turns all others on their heads. While the Flaregun may focus on slow, high damage blows, or the Scorch Shot on reliable splash, or the Detonator for boosting mobility, this Manmelter takes the other turn around. Relying instead on fast firing, high-stacking consecutive hits. Afterburn as it is, is annoying to fight against. Nobody likes dying to fires looong after the fight has been beat right? So the Manmelter has a shorted duration for afterburn and lower direct damage itself, overall capping each hit at 40 afterburn damage, from the standard 60; and 15 damage, from the standard 30. Now this may seem like it kills the weapon, but by default, each hit from this weapon will both refresh the afterburn on an enemy, and stack another one on top. Getting hit by two flares is not only a guaranteed 30 damage, but it also has a potential 80. That's nearly kill on practically all light classes. How about that? Hit three in a row? Bam, you got 45 damage down and 120 coming up. How much time did it take? Well thanks to the 50% faster firing speed (1 shot per second) you can land two blows per second, making that Spy over there start crying and dying only 1.5 seconds into the fight. But not only that, this baby comes with a bonus package in there. Once you deal a full 800 damage, you can boost yourself up with a whopping extra 50% firing speed. Making you able to fire up to four shots a second, melting everything that you can land multiple hits on. But get this! This doesn't only apply to this weapon. It lets you double the damage output of your flamethrower, or swing your axe into that twitch Scout's head at speed faster than his in the bedroom. Since this is a major boost of course, it takes a shitload of damage to build up. A full 800 (33% more than a Soldier Banner), but when you get the boost you are going for some serious beating around here. Your indivisible particle smasher isn't the only thing your enemies are going to cry about, probably because they're dead, and ghosts cry, a lot. ---- Now here's our little brother, just learning how to use an Axe^TM bottle to spice up his night life with all the ladies. But sadly, this little bro can't do much at all as he is. He's got no game on over the other dudes at the club. So how does he spark up himself? With a shitload of sparklers of course! **Third Degree** ~~**Oh hit: Removes overheal**~~ ~~**On hit: Targets cannot be healed for 5 seconds**~~ ~~**100% crits chance against enemies that have been healed in the last second**~~ ~~**All players connected via Medigun beams are hit**~~ ~~*-75% damage against enemies that have not healed in the past 3 seconds**~~ ~~*No random crits*~~ Whoa whoa hold up and look at these stats again honey because they are going to bang your night! Literally, with electricity, at the face, it's going to hurt. This brand spanking new Third Degree gives a jolt of pain to anybody who has been healed in the last second. A full whopping 195 damage critical jolt that is. Not only that, but it pops right through any overheal, shredding off all that confidence that every other merc at the club had before you stepped up to his face. Not only that, but that guy isn't healing for a full 5 seconds after you've smacked his face in, and neither is his Medic behind them, feeling the full force of your smack right through his shades. The Third Degree in this state serves as a major punch to any set-up revolving with a Medic. Landing full-force hits to healing targets themselves, thus changing up the strategy that is standard that is to always attack the Medic. In this weapon's case, the Metagame is to hit the healing patient to land the full set of downsides across the board. But as powerful as this axe is, it can't really do much outside of that party, dealing 50% lower damage to enemies that haven't been healed recently, and lacking any form of random crits as it has it's own crit function. But as it stands, it has no passive upside such as the Powerjack or the Backscratcher, and serves purely as a strong tool against players being pocketed. This gives the Third Degree a niche ability, but one that should be prominent enough to make it worthwhile. --- But that isn't all that these weapons have to offer. Statistics aren't all there is to it, there is always a question on how the metagame for their strategies and synergies will work together. As a set, weapons should work together to create powerful internal combos that make for interesting gameplay. The Flamethrower in this set provides ample healing to fully support he ability to get close enough to use the Third Degree effectively. While the Third Degree rewards flanking purely, it is rather mismatched against un-healed enemies. In which case the attrition aspect of the Manmelter comes in. Allowing for powerful stacking of burning damage. But as this damage stacks, it gains the ability to essentially buff out any other weapon in the set, including itself. Ranging from making the Phlogistinator a merc-melting machine, to the Third Degree repeatedly clubbing down a pocket's face in until they literally disintegrate. Even outside of it's ability to fire off many flares the Manmelter gives good usage overall. As it doubles up the other Flamethrower's ability to deal damage, making Flanking as a Pyro entirely rewarding. Simultaneously granting the melee weapons massive damage output. Even the Phlogistinator itself grants great synergy! No longer will Detonator jumps be so risky due to their health cost, nor will the Backscratcher make you as reliant on health packs. The weapons overall provide ample forms of synergy rivaling the Degreaser itself. From combos to pure damage output, this revised version of the Grordbord Moonman Pack rewards good players all around. "

If you play your cards right, keep spamming crit-a-cola or milk, this could become a weapon like the Half-Zat, for going on slaughter sprees but dying if you don't kill fast enough. **Baby Face's Blaster** *Level 40 Weapon that was killed by Gunmettle* ~~**On kill: the user is granted a speed buff which lasts for 5 seconds**~~ ~~*10% slower movement speed on wearer*~~ ~~*33% smaller clip size*~~ This solves all of the problems with Baby Face's. Pre-gunmettle it was OP, post-gunmettle it was UP. It was OP because there was no such thing as losing the speed boost, and it's now UP because it's too easy to lose the boost. With my idea, as long as you keep killing people, you'll hardly ever lose your boost. Now it's like how scatterguns are supposed to be: sudden all-up-in-yo-grill blitzkreig weapons. Scout's supposed to be for picking off specific targets, and dealing out damage as quickly as he runs away afterward. Not running into a battle in order to get boost, only to lose it whilst running away (post). Not sweeping the entire enemy team (pre). **The Soda Popper** *A terminal case of dah jumps syndrome* ~~**Infinite air jumps are granted whilst the user is under the effects of a Soda**~~ ~~**25% faster reload speed**~~ ~~**50% faster firing speed**~~ ~~*66% smaller clip size*~~ ~~Reloads entire clip at once, with the possibility of losing a shot~~ Note that this is an alternative to the current 'Popper. Right now, the SP is a great weapon, although underrated. Perhaps those who believe it's UP would prefer my stats. A very situational Scattergun. Amazing for distracting a Sentry gun whilst Bonked, and escaping from it even if your team doesn't smash it for you. Great for become a slaughter machine for 8 seconds while Crit-a-Cola'd. Even better for sneaking way behind enemy lines far above their heads, and getting a med pick. ...and now for the secondaries! **Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol** *Fall damage immune leech pistol? Nope.* ~~**On kill: 25% of the user's health is restored**~~ ~~*30% more damage vulnerability whilst active*~~ The +3 health on hit thing just straight up doesn't work. Taking no fall damage on a gangster pistol doesn't make sense. Slower firing speed on a pistol is too terrible a downside. This way it's just like the stock pistol, whip it out and finish someone off instead of peppering a crowd from a mile away to regen the tiniest bit of health, or negating fall damage. Note that I upped the damage vulnerability so that you'll die to a single rocket, meatshot, or grenade when holding this pistol. If you're a gangster you've gotta live life on the edge, man! Pair with Candy Cane and Shortstop to become regen Scout? **The Winger** *Redbull gives me wings* ~~When this weapon is active:~~ ~~**The user is immune to fall damage**~~ ~~**25% jump height increase**~~ ~~*60% smaller clip size*~~ Now here's the pistol that should negate fall damage. I just straight up removed the damage buff, because Winger is like Atomizer: it's a tool, not a weapon. Thank you, everyone for reading through my usual wall of text! I hope you have a wonderful day!

In effect, this weapon takes the best parts of the Tomislav and Brass Beast, but leaves the player with an incredibly large debuff. The heavy remains a tank but becomes more comparable to the demoman or soldier in terms of tanking ability. An unnoted trait is that the Glass Cannon has a very distinct spin up sound, meaning players still need to ambush with caution, particularly because the enemy hearing a spun up Glass Cannon could try to flank the Heavy to get in some cheap damage before they are spotted."

All the others just focus on ""Burn-blow"" and aren't really that differentiated. Hell the Phlog literally forces you to play W+M1 without an airblast. However with this weapon, you can play a more support and build oriented flamethrower. This weapon has a fairly reduced ammo pool, as well as vulnerability to explosives, however, its airblast gimmick brings a new layer of depth to the pyro. The absorbing of enemy projectiles makes pyro a little less potent offensively as he is not throwing them back at enemies and he can't easily push enemies where he wants, however, he gets various small peaks from absorbing them. The health/ammo on absorption rewards the pyro for his timely pulls, and can bring the enemy closer to you or keep a spy from escaping. And if the pyro can not simply spam these absorptions as he has a larger explosive penalty in case he misses one, takes 10 damage if he doesn't absorb or pull in an enemy, and has a much smaller ammo pool to use it from. But if the pyro absorbs and extinguishes his allies right, he can gain the Hudda, which can make him a real force to be reckoned with. The speed, resistance, damage, and ability to do massive bleed on melee make him a real menace, and actually could be conducive to some other less loved weapons. With the SVF, this buff can be deadly as the afterburn+bleed would stack, quickly draining their health as 1 swing could potentially deal 108 damage. While it may have its absorption gimmick, it still can fully function as a normal flamethrower, albeit a strained one with the negatives, but if you can work around them and learn to utilize its mechanics, you can be a tribal terror to your enemies Give me some feedback and tell me what you think"

It's designed to be used in a similar way to how the Wrangler shield was used. It disables the building for 5 seconds (leaving it down for slightly longer than the Wrangler), but causes the building to be almost indestructible, and protects against sappers (giving you time to kill the Spy), whilst still being able to be repaired just as fast. (The Repair Tent does not REMOVE sappers, though, and can't be placed onto a sapped building. Sappers can still be placed, but have no effect until the tent wears off.) However, as well as just replacing your secondary, the Repair Tent also gives you a hefty explosive vulnerability. The item lets you keep your Sentry alive through a push, but in return you have to look out for your own health - the soldier/demo could just aim for you and then take the Sentry out later. In fact, I wanted to add some stat like ""explosions are 25% larger for you"" (but with a slightly smaller vuln). I'm not sure how that would work, though."

Its positive effect of no fall damage only works while the weapon is out, which may cause you to still take damage if you're not fast enough on the switch, and even then, is still relatively negligible given that double jumps/atomizer/hype boost can all help negate taking this. On top of this, the slow firing rate/small clip size makes the health on hit pointless, as your DPS isn't enough to do any real damage, and said firing rate doesn't help you get any significant heals to offput damage or even get a good chuck back. And on top of this you only have 100HP (88HP with sandman) while this weapon is active. So pulling it out is a deathwish as 3 health isn't gonna mean anything when it is endangering you. With these changes the PBPP can be an actual bulking/healing weapon like it used to be, without the issue of overhealed scouts being overtly tanky or players not being able to tell how much health a class had (as you'd only know if he pulled the gun out, and its not that visible even then). The scout can get small health on hit despite the weapons abysmal fire rate, but can overheal from it. Just as well, the scout can gain 30 health from a kill, granting him a reward for finishing off an enemy with a weapon that jeopardizes his health and has low DPS. Just as well, I made the fall damage thing passive again, because given the cons of the weapon, having to lower your potential health by having this weapon out just to subvert the fall damage you're gonna take just doesn't seem conducive to gameplay. If you want to pick off some fleeing and wounded enemies for some quick heals or just can't be bothered with fall damage, then the new PBPP might just be for you.

At basic play, you're at a considerable disadvantage, as you take much more damage and deal much less. After continuously firing for a period, however, you ramp up to being a terrifying god of death. The issue is, of course, that you only get 100 ammo, which means that use the gun effectively you must be incredibly careful with ammo conservation. The main issue with balancing this weapon, to my eyes, is working out how long it takes to ramp up to full effectiveness. If anyone has a good way to crunch the numbers on that, I'd be grateful. #2) The Sickle: Essentially, this gives you better recovery at the cost of staying power. You have to leave the fight sooner, but whip out your melee and a medpack or medic can get you back up and running twice as fast. Good for heavy-medic combos where the heavy actually uses the Sandvich alt-fire. Some may say that this makes recovery as heavy too easy, but personally I don't think it gives him any functionality the Sandvich doesn't already, albeit slightly differently. #3) The Collectivised Food Of The People: It's not a Sandvich with some red paint on! It's completely different! Look, it's got -1 max HP! #4) Set Bonus: You get +1 max HP. Which is to offset the -1 from the lunchbox. ____ This is a set for those who want to play heavy with higher stakes and higher rewards. If you're not very careful, you'll take a lot more damage every fight, what with the -50HP and the negative damage resistances on the Hammer. In addition, you're in real danger of running out of ammo between fights. The compensation for these downsides, however, is that you can recover from fights very easily, and that the Hammer can turn you into a walking tank of total destruction, if only until you run out of ammo. This is my attempt at a higher skill-ceiling heavy. I'm pretty pleased with it; I think it would be a lot of fun to play and not too unbalanced. Thoughts and feedback below, please."

Having the Caber regenerate opens it up to being used at times for mobility rather than just suicidal/gag attacks. Having a damage vulnerability to melee will ensure that the demoman remains vulnerable up close and add a minor downside to having the item equipped.

With this the Pyro no longer is forced into a 2 party system of play: - 1. W+M1 - 2. Scorch Shot Spamming to get MMPH With this the Pyro has some depth to the weapon. Like before the pyro is doing damage to build for his big heal/damage boost, but without it being full crits, its not life or death against him. The buff grants him some extra health at 220 at full activation, this is of course overheal and would decay and would help survive a little longer with his damage reduction only being 60%. With the decreased taunt time the pyro gets full 10.5 seconds of minicrits at his disposal that he can use with any of his other weapons. 110 Back scratcher hits, 41 damage flares, the pyro has free range to use these as he sees fit, no longer restricting him to W+M1 during the boost. To supplement this notion away from mindless pyro gameplay, is the trans-matter absorption. With this the pyro isn't completely defenseless against explosive classes. He can bring the enemy closer to him as well if they are fleeing his range, and he can absorb projectiles from soldiers and demos to gain a small amount of health, MMMPH, and ammo. However with it having 1 second cooldown rather than the .75 cooldown of normal airblasts, it can't continually absorb a constant 4 clip shot of rockets. Against weapons like the beggars and a sticky trap of +3 bombs, the pyro can farm a lot of health, ammo. But if he misses, god help him as he takes an extra 15% damage from explosions, making it a risk vs reward situation when taking on explosive classes. No random crits because you can supply your own mini-crits of course. Give me some feedback and tell me what you think. "

The -20% Movement Speed for 1 second after firing stat is pretty weird in itself - I was trying to think of an extra downside that would affect play even when it was critting, but a passive speed debuff seemed too far. I'm not sure I've gotten the balance right with this weapon still, though, so please feel free to jiggle the stats around... --------- **Non-Stop-Shot** ~~**+Reload Speed**~~ ~~*-85% Clip Size*~~ ---- Not quite so out-there as the first idea, but I still kinda like it. The reload speed would be increased so that it is almost as fast as firing speed. i.e. the idea with this weapon is that you have basically an 'infinite' clip but with a slightly slower overall firing speed - but still faster than firing and then reloading each shot with a Stock Scattergun. ---------- Bonus: Fan O War Rebalance: **Fan O War** ~~**Mark target for death on hit**~~ ~~**+50% Weapon Switch Speed on Wearer**~~ ~~*-85% Weapon Damage*~~ ~~*100% Melee vulnerability on wearer*~~ ------ I'm not sure why Valve added the crit ability to the Fan - it still does less than the stock Bat, so it's not the weapon you're gonna be dealing damage with. The main reason why it's a pain to use is because in the time it takes to switch to melee, run up to an enemy, hit them, and then switch back to your primary, you could've probably just finished them off without the mini-crits in the first place. So with this rebalance, instead of taking too long, it's just a bit riskier - by entering melee range, you're very vulnerable to a melee hit, but if you manage to pull it off, you'll lose less time switching weapons.

This is due to how the low movement speed while spun up extremely lowers the ability of the Heavy to survive without a Medic. And if the Heavy has a Medic, they might as well be using the Minigun/Tomislav so that they can potentially block shots for the Medic. The lower spin-up speed is obviously meant to make it so that catching a heavy off-guard would be more rewarding, but all that it does is make the Heavy unable to properly respond to enemies, even if the Heavy knows that the enemy is coming. The damage resistance while spun up is obviously meant to counter-balance the slow movement speed that the Brass Beast has, but if anything it merely makes a Brass Beast heavy annoying. None of the downsides properly compensate for the upside. ---- Here is my suggestion: **Brass Beast** ~~**+20% firing speed**~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability when not spun up*~~ Due to the way that damage is calculated in TF2, having fast-firing weapons and altering their damage output can create unstable damage patterns. [See here for a display of this with the Degreaser](URL By changing the bonus damage upside for faster firing speed, you gain far more chance to hit an enemy and deal damage, which at close ranges can be the difference between killing a Scout or not. And at long ranges can be the difference between successfully hitting enemies and entirely missing. But this comes at the natural hidden downside of larger ammo consumption, which discourages simply firing mindlessly. This replaces the role that the slower movement speed downside attempted to do. But instead of always crippling the user, it only functions against them should they play badly. The damage vulnerability when not spun up on the other hand, replaces the role of the slower revving speed. This simply punishes a heavy who is caught off-guard, but does not lower the overall ability of a Heavy to react to enemies, which is already one of Heavy's innate downsides. But since the heavy can now properly react to players, the damage resistance when spun up is not necessary, thus, it is removes. This version of the Brass Beast purely rewards good play, and punishes bad game sense. Traits that are crucial to heavy players as a whole, as Heavy is lacking in the skill reward area of weapons, but has few weapons that directly punish bad gameplay without always putting the player at a downside of lower reaction time. Simple and to the point."

It's essentially a mash-up of the Mad Milk and the stock Pistol, while not being as good as either. You can only get 36 health, tops, in a single clip before you have to reload. This pairs really badly with the slower firing speed, so you end up only regaining a trickle of health, all the while you're getting killed faster because of that damage vulnerability. So I propose to add this stat: ~~**On Kill: +40 health**~~ ~~Health gained on kill can overheal up to 185 HP~~ One of the main uses of the Pistol is as a finisher. This attribute encourages that, all while maintaining the harassing use of the Pistol with the On Hit effect. It will also be a reward you more (gaining 40 health on a kill) for an already-high risk (thanks to the 20% damage vulnerability), making it a high-risk/high-reward weapon.

If a team does not have a particular class when the PDA is used, then it reveals the location of the placeholder player's name. ie. You disguise as a pyro but the other team does not have a pyro. Your disguise displays your name as ""Killer207"", who is a heavy on the other team. Thus, the PDA reveals the heavy's location since that's the name you took on. Same goes for multiple classes. "

A flank class can now flank better and people now have ways to deal with afterburn now.

814,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,"[IG] ""The Pyro""",1,3djhf6,http://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/3djhf6/ig_the_pyro/,2015-07-17 05:42:18,"As a Pyro main: The Pyro needs balancing. Many of his weapons are either too good or too bad, and I think that each and every weapon should bring a fun and unique playstyle to the table. I think that every weapon should be both fun to play against and with. :) **The Flamethrower** ~~**Throws flames**~~ ~~**Airblasts**~~ ~~""Heat"" bar can charge up over 5 seconds of shooting flames. Heat bar can be completely cleared by airblasting, or waiting 2 seconds~~ ~~*At full Heat, user begins to take a stream of 30 damage per second*~~ By a ""stream"" I mean that Pyro would take 1 damage over and over throughout a second, adding up to 30. Basically if you W+M1 too much, you need to either airblast or switch to secondary for a bit. Logically all flamethrowers should have this, but then it should be less severe. To me, this is a good nerf for stock. **The Degreaser** ~~**65% faster weapon switch speed**~~ ~~*50% higher airblast cost*~~ ~~*30% less damage done*~~ No more W+M1 with the Degreaser. Now you pretty much HAVE to kill Spies with your secondary, after setting them aflame that is. Also note that now Degreaser has good afterburn! I love my afterburn, but I hate W+M1, no matter who's doing it. 30 ammo per airblast, too. As a Degreaser Pyro: It's a little bit OP ATM. **The Backburner** ~~**100% chance for critical hits from behind**~~ ~~**Reflected projectiles deal critical hits**~~ ~~*50% less ammunition carried*~~ ~~*33% longer airblast cooldown*~~ Crits on back and reflect, 100 ammo, 1 second between airblasts. Now it's a completely skill-based high-risk, high-reward weapon for skillful players exclusively. Encourages good ammo management, reflexes/prediction, and positioning. Go from Pyro to Py-pro! I can't think of any way to balance Phlog, so moving on to Secondaries... Flare Gun is annoying at times, but admittedly fair and skill-based. **The Detonator** ~~**Guarantees Mini-Crit damage on burning targets, regardless of distance**~~ ~~Deals 20-30 damage to enemies and the user~~ ~~*25% less damage dealt*~~ Why did they nerf the Detonator in the first place? It's a fun alternative to other secondaries which is like a pool noodle in battle, but an amazing mobility tool. Is it a coincidence that they nerfed Det after Sketchek quit Youtube, or does GabeN have a grudge? **Reserve Shooter** ~~**30% faster weapon switch speed**~~ ~~**Mini-crits airborne targets for 5 seconds after switch**~~ ~~*34% smaller clip size*~~ ~~*No longer usable by Pyros*~~ It never made basic logical sense, and it was ludicrously overpowered when combined with Pyro's most basic ability, the airblast. How long has this gone unfixed? How long has it been terrible for Soldiers (the class that it was designed for), and terrible for Pyros? Well, I say no more. Note the 30% instead of 15% faster switch speed. **The Manmelter** ~~**Does not require ammunition**~~ ~~**50% faster projectile speed**~~ ~~**Protectiles extinguish friendly players, and penetrate enemy and friendly players**~~ ~~**Store crits for extinguishing friendly players**~~ ~~*50% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*No random crits*~~ ~~When extinguishing players with a critical hit, two crits are granted~~ Now you have to actually hit people with the projectiles to extinguish them. Essentially the Machina of flare guns, but with a fun guaranteed crit mechanic. Well, fun for you, not so much for anyone in your way. Great for shooting at objectives. Two hits and you've got yourself a Machina-style multi-kill. Note the firing speed going from 20% slower to 50% slower. **The Panic Attack** ~~**Deals Mini-crits when user is lower than 50% health**~~ ~~Movement speed increases as health decreases~~ ~~Reload speed increases as carried ammunition decreases~~ ~~*15% less damage dealt*~~ All of the upsides activate the worse your situation is. When I [posted it last](URL many people complained about how it has no direct downside. Although I felt like it was fine, I've responded to feedback in this new and improved version. I completely scrapped the Beggar's mechanic from it, and changed it into what PA should be... Something that makes you (and your enemies) panic! Note how I switched what affects what in the old and new versions. The Axetinguisher and Homewrecker are fine in my opinion, although it doesn't make sense for an axe wrapped in barbed wire and a sledgehammer to do so little damage... **The Powerjack** ~~**On kill: restores 75 health points. Can overheal from maximum health**~~ ~~**15% faster movement speed while active**~~ ~~*20% damage vulnerability while active*~~ ~~*75% less health received from healers*~~ Bring back hammertime! The Powerjack isn't dead yet, we can bring it back! One thing that's always been really annoying about Powerjack: It always crits. Sadly removing crits from PJ would also ruin hammertime, so I've settled for this: 75% less health from healers at all times. Although I never use the Powerjack, I fully support Powerjack users, and I think that the recent Powerjack nerf was far too harsh. Backscratcher is good... **THE SHARPENED VOLCANO FRAGMENT** *Level 75 war axe of Sun God Helios* ~~**30% more damage done**~~ ~~**Scores greatly increased knockback against burning players**~~ ~~**On Hit: Target is engulfed in flames**~~ ~~*This weapon's fragile blade is broken when the holder is airblasted, moistened, or in a critical hit exchange*~~ ~~Blade recharges every 20 seconds~~ ~~*50% less damage done without this weapon's blade*~~ Copypasta from [my post here](URL Critical hit exchange = receiving or dealing a critical hit. The blade can break when you're not holding the weapon. Jarate destroys the blade. **The Third Degree** ~~**Damage transfers to all players connected by Medibeams**~~ ~~*10% slower firing speed*~~ Solemn Vow style. **The Neon Annihilator** ~~**100% critical hits on wet or Jarate'd players**~~ ~~**On hit underwater: AOE electric shock attack damages nearby enemies**~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~*20% slower firing speed*~~ Hey! Removing sappers is the Homewrecker's gimmick. Slower firing speed instead of less damage, added crits agains Jarate'd players. Within a buff banner radius of the hit player, underwater enemies get shocked for critical damage. Well, that sums up my feelings about Pyro. I've mained Pyro for a while now and gotten pretty good at it, and I've noticed that most of the skill-based weapons for Pyro reward you the least, whereas employing brain-dead tactics like W+M1 is the most surefire way to success as a Pyro. It's ridiculous. I've done everything from Flarepunch to the Mean Green Slaughter Machine (RS) to Backburner, and it's become very obvious that W+M1 is the best ""strategy"" for Pyro. Absolutely disgusting. I wish that this wasn't the way it is. It makes me sick to my stomach how every other class is mostly fair and balanced after Gun Mettle, and yet the only thing that happened to Pyro (ignoring Scorch)? They nerfed his most fun, skill-based, original, extraordinary weapon: the Detonator. TL;DR: The less honorable techniques you employ, the better you do as the Pyro. Icky."

I don't think the enemy team should be able to benefit from you killing one of their allies. * The minor change in explosive vulnerability is to make sure you don't get one shot by enemy demos pipes. Scout hard-counters demo, a single weapon shouldn't change that. * The damage penalty and slower swing speed compensate for the buffs to the other stats, making this weapon more of a utility. Explanation of how these stats would synergize in a game: A choice weapon to equip when playing roaming scout or when your team lacks heal sources. Usable in situations where you would like to improve the health of your team or yourself. With ample healing sources, this weapon becomes a downgrade as you are taking more explosive damage and giving less finishing power in your melee.

This made me realize how much the PDA slot should be what changes how buildings function, and how the wrench changes how the engineer works with the buildings. ---- For this all to make sense of course, the Gunslinger would need to be split into two weapons. **Gunslinger** In melee slot ~~**+25 max health on wearer**~~ ~~**Combo attack**~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~*-25% repair rate*~~ Keeping in theme with the Gunslinger (wrench) being a weapon for combat. The downside making it worse at keeping buildings alive, that way it still pairs well with the Mini-sentry #+ **Combat Mini sentry** For the PDA slot ~~Replaces the Sentry with a fast building Mini-Sentry~~ ---- **Rigged Dispenser** PDA *[Level 80 demolition tool](URL ~~**On manual destruction: Dispenser explodes, dealing damage and knockback based on loaded ammo**~~ ~~*+30% dispenser cost*~~ Based on the Team Fortress Classic dispenser, with this you trade off 30 metal on your dispenser, for the ability to cause it to detonate. This would allow for an engineer to have an interesting method for mobility or sneaky traps. ---- **Callidusporter** PDA *[Level 73 Scientific Impossibility](URL ~~**Replaces the Teleporter with a Callidusporter Pad**~~ ~~**Silent Building**~~ Does not make trails, sound, or noise when teleporting. And builds with no noise. ~~*Cannot teleport self*~~ ~~*Cannot upgrade past level 1*~~ This teleporter helps support a more flank-type Engineer. By being silent, it allows for your team to teleport to places without being noticed, but to limit this it cannot teleport that many players. And the Engineer themselves cannot use the teleporter, BUT this can be countered by using the Eureka Effect. Thus helping support the usage of non-standard wrenches. ---- **International Border** PDA *Level 11 Texas-Mexico reference* ~~**Replaces Sentry with a Shielded Turret**~~ As for the 'turret' itself: ~~**Has a shield that absorbs damage**~~ 150 Health shield ~~**Shield recharges after not taking damage for 2 seconds**~~ Base 10HP/s, +40HP/s after 3 more seconds. ~~*-66% health*~~ 50 base health ~~*Cannot upgrade past level 1*~~ The inverse to a Gunslinger. You trade off the ability to build past level 1 for a more durable level 1 building that is more self-reliable. Due to it's low health, it's likely to die after the shield falls. But as a baseline it has more overall 50 more ""health"" than a level 1 sentry. By making it less reliable on the Engy to repair it, this would encourage the Engineer for a more roaming/combat based role. This sentry would serve as a more stable flank defense, but not as spammable as the Mini-sentry. ---- **The Last Alamo-ny** PDA *[Level 83 Last Resort](URL ~~Replaces Sentry with a Chaingun Turret~~ As for the turret: ~~**Fire rate increases over consecutive fire**~~ From 0 to +20% at level 1, Up to +30% at level 2 ~~*-20% turn speed*~~ ~~*Fires while tracking*~~ Directly where the Sentry is pointed ~~*Can only upgrade to level 2*~~ You trade off reliability against fast classes in open space for a more powerful weapon against heavier classes. The pre-preemptive firing while zoning in on a target would result in the turret to generally have a faster firing rate. This weapon would be more susceptible to being flanked, as it would take longer to be able to target enemies at it's sides or behind it. Would be primarily useful at holding a common zone. But power comes at the cost of being innable to reach level 3, thus lowering it's overall capable health, making it be counterable by being overwhelmed. ---- **Eye for an Eye** PDA *[Level 3 Sensor Node](URL ~~**Allows for the building of a Sensor**~~ ~~*-50% metal received from ammo packs*~~ As for the sensor: ~~90 Health~~ ~~Build time of 3 seconds~~ ~~50 metal to build~~ ~~Cloaks in the vicinity of enemies~~ Drains ammo from the sensor, 20 seconds of cloak overall ~~**Grants Engineer outline of enemies within 512 Hammer Units from sensor**~~ By trading off the ability to rely on ammo packs, the Engineer can now have a method of having knowledge of enemies nearby the sensor. This would be a tool used by Flank/Ninja-based Engineers to have some more situational awareness. ---- **Two Way Transporter** PDA *Level 2 Way* ~~**Exit teleporters can now teleport users to Entrance**~~ ~~*Both teleporters are destroyed if one is destroyed*~~ Teleporters will not be able to provide multi-way transportation from one side to the other. This could be used as a passage on maps between key chokes or flanks, or as a method of returning to spawn.

You hate this weapon. Pretty much anyone with more than five minutes invested in the game hates this weapon. It's not overpowered, but it's broken as shit. It lowers the skill ceiling from stock, and rewards the kind of play that should already be possible with the Backburner. As an unlock, it doesn't do its job in making a new style of skilled gameplay for the Pyro, a class that is pretty limited in their primary weaponry (and that's putting it lightly). I mean, deal damage, get rewarded by being able to deal even more damage? That's the kind of thing you give to a Soldier. That's the problem with Pyro, they don't stand out, it's like everything they do is just a shittier version of another class. The main idea of this rework is to turn a shitty weapon into a weapon that promotes a style of play that only Pyros would specialize in. The way I see it, there's one element that the Pyro has at all times that the other classes would need an unlock to do only some of the time: Damage over Time. So I want to rework the Phlog to be able to do this well. The Phlog has certain principles that has got to stay consistent in my opinion, or else I might as well just make a new weapon: &gt;The ""Mmph!"" meter-raising gimmick &gt;Vulnerability to common projectiles &gt;Encouraging fire damage Alright, so here it is: **The Phlogistinator** ~~*-10% damage penalty*~~ ~~*+20% vulnerability to explosives*~~ ~~**When ""Mmph!"" is filled, fire damage from the Phlogistinator incurs HeartBurn status on enemies**~~ ~~Airblast use depletes 25% of the ""Mmph!"" meter~~ So the biggest difference here is what happens once you fill the Mmph! meter. You don't get critical hits or a full heal. Instead, your flames are able to deal a new status on enemies called HeartBurn. HeartBurn doubles fire vulnerability as long as it is active, negates attempts to remove afterburn (for example, Jarate, Mad Milk and Spy-cicle will do nothing), and halves all healing done to the enemy from all sources. Other Pyros and Targe Demoknights will experience no afterburn, but still suffer from increased fire vulnerability and decreased healing. All Pyros can deal DoT, but often their ability to do so is pointless what with the many, many ways players can negate afterburn. This Phlog will reward survivable and ability to deal damage with a small period of time in which they can do so effectively, in a way no other player can, not even if you're the best at throwing Guillotines and Wrapping Paper baubles. HeartBurn status hinders the enemies' ability to keep their health even after you die, and if any of them survive- hell, if all of them survive- they will be softened up for other players to finish off. Part of what was /supposed/ to make the Phlog balanced was taking away its airblast, but this new version still has it. Removing the airblast lowered the skill ceiling of the old Phlog too much. Now you can use it, however, at the cost of your Mmph! (alongside your ammo). Because of the increased explosives vulnerability, you are essentially forced to use your airblast just to survive if you can't dodge, but whenever you do so, you delay the opportunity to set off your Mmph! power. An errant grenade could one-shot you, so watch out. With the old Phlog, you'd just be screwed because you lack airblast entirely. Now, you have it, but it's a proper choice, you have to prioritize whether or not to use it or to keep building Mmph!. Effectively, it will keep Soldiers and Demos as decent counters to a Phlog Pyro, because even if they get killed by an airblast, they would at least delay the Mmph!. I had a lot of other ideas for what a filled Mmph! could do for the Pyro besides just do more damage. I thought it could help the Pyro's mobility for a small period, or increase their resistances for a small period. I decided on improving the Pyro's ability to deal DoT, since that is their one distinguishing feature. It will help set Pyro apart from other classes, and give them a new way to help their teammates and disadvantage their enemies."

Buff ends if the spy decloaks early.*~~ ~~*Cash explodes upward from where the backstab occurred*~~ ~~""Here. That's what you're worth!""~~ I removed the invisibility mechanic so that the spy would be able to retain flexibility in making gameplay decisions. I kept the cloak penalty because I felt it was an appropriate counter for the movement speed boost. I increased the movement speed slightly as well as the buff duration so that it now lasts for half the duration of the spy's cloak instead of having a set time, making it benefit from the L'Etranger. To counteract how potentially OP 4-7 seconds of 115% spy move speed would be, I made it only take effect while the spy is cloaked, inhibiting him from using his weapons while he zips around, unless he decloaks first (which immediately kills the buff). Finally, I added a 10 second window to ""trigger"" the buff rather than activating it right away so that this would be useable with the dead ringer (gives the spy a chance to perform a believable feign). The cash explosion is mostly for flair (it IS called the Big Earner), but since the spy gains the movement buff only while cloaked, the cash explosion functions as a visual notifier that the spy is using the Big Earner, and thus enemy players can adjust accordingly. This new version still holds up my original vision for the Big Earner as a hit-and-run style weapon, but also gives it the potential to chain backstabs and allow the spy to perform snappy infiltrations behind enemy lines. Effectively, the spy cannot stay invisible as long (and even with the speed buff cannot travel as much distance before his cloak runs out), but in exchange he is able to carry out his actions more expediently. ////// OLD CONCEPT BEGINS HERE **Big Earner** *Level 1-100 Knife* ~~**On backstab: Immediately turns the spy invisible and increases his movement speed by 10% for 2 seconds. The invisibility effect behaves similarly to but does not use cloak.**~~ ~~*-20% max cloak*~~ ~~*+1 second decloak time following invisibility*~~ ~~*Cash explodes upward from where the backstab occurred*~~ ~~""Here. That's what you're worth!""~~ My attempt at making the Big Earner into something palatable to spy players. This compliments a hit-and-run playstyle since the invisibility fully takes effect on a backstab, forcing the spy out of combat but also giving him the 10% speed buff to evade pursuing enemies or find a place to decloak. The cash explosion and reduced cloak duration are in place to offset the tactical advantage of instant invisibility. I added an increased decloak duration for decloaking from invisibility to give the spy a vulnerability which alert players can exploit if the spy tries to utilize the speed increase to catch up to enemies and chain together backstabs."

Go to boot camp if you don't know what I'm talking about. This rage is completely different. For every kill you get 5 seconds of 50% faster firing speed on any and all weapons. This is not an AoE buff, and it activates the instant you hit right click. Not stackable. This thing is a two-shotty to almost every class, sticking with the theme from the War Saw Fact of dishing out huge damage quickly! And the downside? 20% damage vulnerability. If you think that this isn't balanced, you've clearly never played Heavy too seriously. Overextension from their team/Medic can easily kill any Heavy. Why? Because the second you're on the battlefield you become a huge target to everyone! Heavy has the most health, and has one of the highest damage outputs. Therefore, any respectable team will aim at a Heavy in favor of shooting any other class. Just see what happens if you don't! This is more of a weapon to pull out when cornered or faced by a dead end. Just quickly change directions and put those two hits into your enemy. Not too hard. But then again they're fools for getting within your range. Works surprisingly well with the Holiday Punch, so why not with this? Note that this weapon is also for the Pyro! It's not like you weren't already doomed when you get up close and personal with a Pyro. Edit: Added rage meter. **The Outdoorsman** To wrap this set up. With these weapons all put together, you become a crazy close-range killing machine! Of course, these weapons probably work better when used seperately, but hey. Are you extreme enough to become the ultimate lumberjack? Thanks for reading, everyone! Have a fantastic day!"

Keep in mind this may not be super great, but I tried. **Baby Face's Blaster** *Level 10 Scattergun* ~~**On hit: Builds Boost**~~ ~~**Run speed increases with Boost**~~ ~~*-34% Clip size*~~ ~~*10% Slower movement speed on user*~~ ~~*Boost is slowly reduced over time and with airjumps. It only increases again when more damage is done.*~~ The way this gun works now is that you must KEEP hitting people to keep the movement speed. No more running around the map full speed waiting for someone to show up. **Sun-on-a-Stick** *Level 10 RIFT Fire Mace* ~~**Right click to extinguish a burning ally**~~ ~~**Extinguishing an ally earns a 100% critical hit on next swing**~~ ~~*-25% Damage penalty*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ This was surprisingly harder to think of a fix for. I decided to just remove the stupid concept of critting burning players, and came up with a different way of getting crits. **The Liberty Launcher** *Level 25 Rocket Launcher* ~~**+40% Projectile speed**~~ ~~**+20% Blast radius**~~ ~~*-20% Damage penalty*~~ I basically made this the opposite of the Direct Hit, which is what I assume it was meant to be. **The Panic Attack** *Level 1 Shotgun* ~~**Firing rate and reload time increase as health decreases**~~ ~~*Weapon spread increases as health decreases*~~ The only thing wrong with this before was the god awful pre-loading mechanism. **The Phlogistinator** *Level 10 Flamethrower* ~~**All fire damage charges 'Mmmph', activate after 400 damage to crit for several seconds**~~ ~~**While activating 'Mmmph': 50% Damage immunity**~~ ~~*-15% Damage penalty*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~*No airblast*~~ Pretty easy to balance, more damage needs to be done for Mmmph and less resistance while taunting. Maybe this will encourage pyros to hide when taunting instead of standing in the open. **The Third Degree** *Level 10 Fire Axe* ~~**All players connected via medi-beams are hit**~~ ~~*-30% Swing speed*~~ No longer a direct upgrade. **The Loch-n-Load** *Level 10 Grenade Launcher* ~~**+25% Damage bonus**~~ ~~**+20% Projectile spped**~~ ~~*-50% Clip size*~~ ~~*+25% Self damage*~~ ~~*Launched bombs shatter on surfaces*~~ Returned to old stats **The Family Business** *Level 10 Shotgun* ~~**+33% Clip size**~~ ~~**+15% Firing speed**~~ ~~*-15% Damage penalty*~~ ~~*-22% Reserve ammo (25 rather than 32)*~~ Now you can fire off all those extra shots even faster, but at the cost of less damage and less reserve ammo. **Tomislav** *Level 25 Minigun* ~~**+25% Faster spin up time**~~ ~~**Silent Killer: No barrel spin sound**~~ ~~*-20% Slower firing speed*~~ The problem with this gun is simply that it doesn't spin up fast enough for it to be the fast spin up gun. **The Dalokohs Bar** *Level 1 Lunch Box* ~~**Adds +100 max health for 30 seconds**~~ ~~*+15% Damage vulnerability when used*~~ It's not broken too much, just a bit underpowered to the point where almost no one uses it. **The Eviction Notice** *Level 10 Boxing Gloves* ~~**+50% Swing speed**~~ ~~*-40% Damage penalty*~~ ~~*-20 max health on user*~~ This weapon is currently truly broken. The stats are written in a way that it's a direct downgrade to the fists, with the reduced damage way overcompensating for the increased swing speed. The current stats are +50% fire speed and -60% damage, so fire speed doesn't even make it a sidegrade. **The Overdose** *Level 15 Syringe Gun Prototype* ~~*-10% Damage penalty*~~ ~~Movement speed increases based on UberCharge percentage to a maximum of 20%. Increased movement speed is applied when using any weapon.~~ Speed is now applied when using any weapon. I also increased the maximum added speed (20% may be too much). **The Solemn Vow** *Level 10 Bust of Hippocrates* ~~**Allows you to see enemy health**~~ ~~*-100% Damage penalty*~~ ~~'Do no harm.'~~ I mean, it does say DO NO HARM **The Sydney Sleeper** *Level 1 Sniper Rifle* ~~**+25% Charge rate**~~ ~~**On hit: Jarate applied to target for 8 seconds**~~ ~~**Shooting a friendly player will extinguish them**~~ ~~*-20% Damage penalty*~~ ~~*Can not headshot*~~ I tried to make the Sleeper into more of a support sniper, so now it extinguishes people. That's all people really want in this weapon basically **The Reserve Shooter** *Level 10 Shotgun* ~~**+15% Faster weapon switch**~~ ~~**Mini-crits targets launched into the air through airblast/knockback for 5 seconds after being deployed**~~ ~~*-34% Clip size*~~ The only thing wrong with this weapon is that it can mini-crit people who just jump, or in some cases walk down some stairs. Now you have to do what it was intended to do, knock or airblast someone into the air, in order to get the extra damage. Other weapons that are broken / underpowered that I could not think of fixes for: - Air Strike - Sharpened Volcano Fragment - Classic - Big Earner - Scorch Shot - Neon Annihilator Gunslinger not included because it is not broken, simply annoying. Annoying and overpowered are two very different things. Mini-sentries are actually pretty easy to fight against in reality. Please give me feedback and tell me if there's anything I missed or you think should be included "
836,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[IG] Everything &lt;Scout&gt;. Literally.,0,37j5yg,http://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/37j5yg/ig_everything_scout_literally/,2015-05-28 10:35:17,"~~*If you are the kind of person who has gotten too used to playing Scout with his unbalanced weapons, this is not the thread for you.*~~ ~~**If you have too much time on your hands and want to read a large amount of rebalancing suggestions, this is the thread for you.**~~ ~~Unless specified otherwise, consider the current stats as the baseline for the items being balanced.~~ In other words, if there's a change to the Scattergun, it does not mean that all the other weapons have been changed themselves. This is to simply save time because rewording everything is confusing. ---- #Primaries ----- **Scattergun** Nerf ~~*20% slower firing speed*~~ ~~*20% wider bullet spread*~~ ~~*65% slower first reload*~~ This Scattergun is more based around Valve's original design of the weapon. To quote the Hydro Developer Commentary: &gt;Much of his combat style is crafted through the features of his primary weapon, the Scattergun. It does a large amount of damage, but has a wide spread that forces him to get close to the enemy for full effect, where he's also at highest risk of being hurt. It has a slow rate of fire that encourages him to pause to fire, then dodge, then pause, and so on, which gives enemies a higher chance to hit him at intervals. Finally, it holds a small clip and a slow reload time to encourage the Scout to pull out of combat to reload, something which he can do easily with his speed, and gives injured enemies a chance to run before the Scout returns. Save for the low clip size, everything else has been reworked to become more accurate. By rebalancing the Scattergun all other Scout primaries will be far easier to rebalance as they will not have to compete against an overtly powerful weapon to be viable. ----- **Force a Nature** Nerf ~~*Only applies knockback to enemies when at least 10 pellets hit*~~ The FoN fires 12 pellets. ~~Reload glitch gets fixed~~ Similar to the Sandman and Natascha, weapons that extremely negate the enemy ability to control their movement are extremely unfun to play against. ---- **Shortstop** Possible buffs * ~~**Has 175% damage ramp up**~~ For whatever reason Valve made the Shortstop have only 150% damage ramp up, whereas all other Scout primaries have 175%. Anybody who has used the weapon understands how much this penalizes good usage of it. or * ~~**+25 health on user**~~ The Milkman set originally gave the user +25 health when equipped. Many other set weapons were buffed when sets were removed, except for the Shortstop. or * ~~**35% faster reload speed**~~ The Shortstop used to have a reload speed of .76 seconds. This proved to be too powerful, so Valve nerfed it hard. A reversal to 1 second long reload would give the weapon an ability to actually reload mid combat. ----- **Soda Popper** Nerf ~~*Every additional jump made costs 5 health*~~ ~~Reload glitch gets fixed~~ Any person who has played a projectile class knows that it's damn near impossible to beat a Soda Popper scout. Similarly to the Atomizer there has to be a limit to how much the Scout puts in and out. And running for 13 seconds is barely enough. ----- **Baby Face Blaster** Entire rework *Disregard any previous stats* ~~**+40% movement speed on wearer when active**~~ ~~*For every shot missing in clip, -15% movement speed*~~ ~~*100% slower first reload*~~ Simply put: The current downsides to the weapons do not at all reduce it's ability to kill. It's easy to build boost (even if it did drain over time), double jumps are easily refilled as enemies are plenty, and the smaller clip does barely anything at all. And if the downsides don't work, then remove them and put something else. Now the weapon would keep in theme with the whole speed based combat. But after 2 shots the Scout will have to decide to either dedicate to the fight or run away to reload (hence supporting the hit and run based combat, while at the same time not making it annoying). ---- **BackScatter** Buff ~~**No longer has worse bullet spread**~~ The weapon is pretty near useful at the moment. But the bullet spread counter works the mini-crit from the back upside. ----- # Secondaries ---- **Bonk! Atomic Punch** Nerf ~~*Damage taken reduces the duration of the invulnerability*~~ Similarly to the pre-nerf Dead Ringer, to become nearly/invincible on demand is extremely unfun to play against. ----- **Crit a Cola** Nerf *Disregard any previous stats* ~~**When used, all damage dealt will be mini-crits**~~ ~~*When used, all damage taken will be mni-crits*~~ As show-cased by the Loch and Load, Reserve Shooter, and the (current) Crit a Cola; ""More damage faster"" is a horrible design baseline. ----- **Mad Milk** Nerf ~~*Can splash self*~~ Nobody likes fighting against a Scout at close range when all of a sudden the Scout has splashed milk all over you and is easily healing back 60 health per shot. For all splash based weapons, there should be a downside to the user using them in such a close range. ---- **Winger** Buff ~~**Jump-height boost is passive**~~ Self-explanatory. ---- **Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol** Nerf ~~**No longer take extra damage from fire**~~ ~~*10% damage vulnerability while in air*~~ The fire vulnerability for this weapon is pathetic. There are only 2 classes in game where the enemy can light you on fire. As much as I love the weapon, that downside is a joke. Going in theme with the Original set, this weapon would have the user take a vulnerability while in the air. Which is a place where Scouts can often be. ---- **Flying Guillotine** Nerf ~~*Mini-crits against 'stunned' targets*~~ Everyone here knows why. ---- #Melee ---- **Bat** Buff ~~**On swing: Reflects extremely close projectiles**~~ Even stock has to have a use, come on. ---- **Sandman** Nerf ~~*No longer stuns enemy, instead slows down their movement speed by 25% for x seconds*~~ Nobody likes being stunned. Nobody. ---- **Candy Cane** Rework ~~**User no longer has explosive vulnerability**~~ ~~*Knockback taken increases as the user becomes injured*~~ Up to 40% more Same deal as the Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol but inverted. It's far too easy to take blast damage in TF2. As shown by usage of the Shortstop, knockback taken is a downside that is manageable by user skill; Both for the player and the opponent. ---- **Sun on a Stick** Rework *Ignore all previous stats* ~~**When user is on fire and weapon is active, attacking launches fireballs that set enemies on fire**~~ Each fireball deals 30 damage ~~**Fireballs mini-crit against burning enemies**~~ ~~*-50% damage*~~ We all know how useless it is to try and melee someone who is on fire when the player is a Scout. A 78 damage melee is nothing compared to a 105 damage Scattergun shot. Keeping in theme with the Wrap Assassin, Guillotine, and Sandman. The Sun on a Stick could be reworked to be a more situational yet more powerful version of the bleed based weapons. ---- **Atomizer** Nerf ~~*Double-jumps and triple jumps cost 5 health*~~ The current downside of 10 health is extremely easily circumvented. And in many cases does not actually cost the Scout much for the majority of the time. Essentially being a free triple jump. To fix this: All double/triple jumps cost 5 health (instead of only 10 on a triple). A weapon with a passive upside must have a passive downside^2. ---- **Wrap Assassin** Buff ~~**On-kill: Refill bauble**~~ The Wrap Assassin is extremely outclassed in two fronts: The Guillotine deals far more damage. And the Sandman allows for far more damage. By making the bauble get refilled on kill, the weapon becomes overall more useable. ---- I am ready to be pelted to death now."

This is a major drawback if you're even 10 degrees off to the side in your aim, crits will not hit even if they should have. ##Degreaser (Nerf) (-) Airblast reset timer only counts down when the weapon is active &gt; All other stats remain the same or (-) Switch speed back to degreaser is 65% slower &gt; All other stats remain the same The degreaser has an action-based downside, with a passive-based upside. This is bad game design, and the M2+q+M1+q (AKA stunlock) strategy that exists because of it is a perfectly highlight of the issue. By using any one of the above suggestions, the faults described by /u/Kairu927 in [this comment](URL might be alleviated. ##Phlogistinator (Rework) The Manmelter and Phlogistinator have reversed item properties. Each weapon's abilities would fit better with the other weapon. Ignore any previous stats (+) Reflecting projectiles adds 1 to Mmmph meter (+) Airblasting allies adds 3 to Mmmph meter On taunt: Drains Mmmph meter &gt;Heals (medigun/dispenser fashion) the user and gives mini-crits for &lt;Mmmph #&gt; seconds (-) -10% damage penalty (-) Airblast that do not hit allies or projectiles cost 100% more ammo This weapon would add a different playstyle to the pyro, one that relies on supporting the team (Manmelter style) and reflecting projectiles. From there the weapon is built to still maintain the ""M1"" playstyle of the current phlog. This weapon overall would actually reward skillful play, unlike the current design. ## Reserve Shooter (Buff/Nerf/Rework) (Only for pyro) Ignore any previous stats (+) 20% damage against airborne targets (nerf from Mini-criting targets in the air) (-) 10% damage against targets on the ground (+) 30% weapon switch speed The weapon now has the sole design for being for airborne targets without being overtly powerful. Yet with a buff to the switch speed overall so that the weapon can be used with other Primaries aside from the Degreaser. If the 2nd degreaser nerf option was put in place, this weapon would become rather balanced. ##Manmelter (Buff/Rework) The Manmelter and Phlogistinator have reversed item properties. Each weapon's abilities would fit better with the other weapon. Ignore any previous stats (+) Meter fills based on fire damage done (100 for a full meter) On alt-fire with full meter: Crit shot is fired Now the weapon can be on somewhat even terms with the Flare Gun, by filling in a niche of being a more controlled/specified version of the Flare, this weapon would be primarily used against Snipers, or as a last resort (where the Flare Gun would likely crit regardless). It allows for users that do not use the Degreaser to have a weapon that provides them with burst damage. ##Scorch Shot (Buff) (+) 50% more after-burn damage (+) 25% longer afterburn duration The Flare Gun deals burst, the Detonator provides mobility, the reworked Manmelter provides burst, the Scorch Shot could be used to fill the role of prolonged damage. ##Powerjack (Nerf) The +75 health on kill attribute does not match the weapon. It blurs this weapon's role in the same fashion as the Pre-Split Equalizer. +75 health on kill is an attribute that would be fitting for the Back Scratcher. Ignore any previous stats (+) 10% movement speed when active (see below) (-) 20% damage vulnerability when active ##Back Scratcher (Buff) (+) 75 health on kill The backscratcher is purely a lone roaming/surviving weapon. The reduction in healing from allies is a major drawback, while the bonus health from health packs is not a large enough bonus. Adding health on kill would be fitting for the specific role of being a damage dealing weapon. RIP DeGroot Keep ##Sharpened Volcano Fragment (Buff) (+) Afterburn deals 100% more damage (+) Afterburn lasts 100% longer The weapon's afterburn simply does not deal enough at the moment. At 52 damage per melee hit, with negligible burning, the current weapon is a joke. By bumping up the afterburn to a more serious level, the weapon will serve as a last resort 'you're going down with me' weapon. ##Third Degree (Buff/Nerf) (+) Deals 150% more damage if target has been healed in the last 5 seconds (=) Deals standard damage to players otherwise connected by medibeams (-) Deals -50% if a target hasn't been healed in the last 5 seconds The T.D. now becomes a more specialized, and more powerful version of the old Axtinguisher. Now it can actually serve a functional role if the weapon is needed. Instead of the current state that is practically useless unless you get a random crit. #Pyro Overall ##Movement speed +5-7% base movement speed Pyro is a flanking class, yet it lacks the ability to flank effectively. ##IMPORTANT: Flamethrower viewmodel particles Fix flamethrower fire particle's viewmodels. Currently as it stats, the fire in first person view is not at all accurate. There needs to be a fix of this. ##Airblast Revert airblast to pre-patch version Previously, airblast would simply add knockback to the enemy in whatever direction the Pyro was pointing (See here: URL but after this glitched with the Reserve Shooter, it was changed to remove enemy momentum, then apply a specific momentum regardless of what the enemy had beforehand. Essentially a skilless stunlock. ---- Hopefully this set of buffs and nerfs would help pyro have more actually viable weapon loadouts. Instead of simply being reliant on the current Stun+Crit combo."

I feel the health &amp; vulnerability punishment may be too much. I wanted a flamethrower that rewarded players for ambushing and doing what they were supposed to do, while also providing enough ammo for airblast to extinguish teammates and carry out other functions, without deducting damage. I tested this with SourceMod and TF2Items installed on a server, and deals 9 damage per particle instead of the regular 7 (without damage spread).

851,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,The Traverse Engineer - Engineer Set,5,2vgr31,http://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/2vgr31/the_traverse_engineer_engineer_set/,2015-02-11 09:04:39,"Fellow Engineers, what's the number one problem we all face when building a sentry? It's not the Spies, or the Demos (although those are a big problems and you should equip Pomson and Short Circuit for those), but the fact that it's quite boring to stay near your sentry all the time. So the answer would be to use the Gunslinger right? But you're on defense. Minis are near useless to a capable team. The solution? Ladies and gentlemen, The Traverse Engineer set! **The Parallel Circuit** *Level XX Shotgun* ~~**Mini-crits on enemies slower than the player**~~ ~~**On kill: repairs all damage buildings with 50 health**~~ ~~*-20% damage penalty on players faster than the player*~~ ~~*-15% max health on wearer*~~ The Parallel Circuit mini-crits on any target slower than you. Heavies, Demos, and Soldier won't be as big of a problem any longer! What's more is that if you kill someone with this baby, any damaged buildings will be healed a tiny bit, even if your buildings are being sapped! So if you kill that snake of a Spy who sapped your sentry, it'll get a bit of health back before you take that Godforsaken sapper off. The downsides? You're giving up a bit of your resistance to damage with less max health. Also Scouts and Medics are a bit more of a threat now because it does less damage to players slower than you. However, Pyros, other Engies, Spies, and Snipers will all do normal Shotgun damage. So you won't be as useless against them (well, with 110 health you will be, but you know). -- **The Green Wire** *Level XX Pistol* ~~**Mini-crits enemies who have taken damage by your sentry in the last 3 seconds**~~ ~~**On hit: damage dealt is returned as ammo**~~ ~~**+25% more accurate**~~ ~~**No reload necessary**~~ ~~*Per shot: -10 ammo*~~ ~~*Uses metal for ammo*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ A new pistol for Engie? We haven't had that in...when was the game first out? Oh right, 2007. Anyway, this beauty may look like a handgun version of the Widowmaker. However, if you shoot someone who's recently been shot by your sentry, it will mini-crit them, giving you even more ammo back! It's also slightly more accurate than the normal pistol because of mid range encounter where when you're running on ammo power, every shot counts. Downsides are of course that it runs on ammo. No ammo, no shooty. Also, no random critical hits because how fair is it to randomly get 2 seconds of free ammo? It's not. You stop that, mister. -- **The Wrench Connection** *Level XX Wrench* ~~**35% of all damage done by your sentry is returned as health**~~ ~~**Health returned can overheal**~~ ~~*30% of all damage done to your sentry injures you*~~ ~~*20% melee vulnerability on wearer*~~ The pice de rsistance, the Wrench Connection tests how well you and your sentry work together. While equipping this wrench, 35% of all damage done by your sentry will heal you and beyond (up to a max of 165 or 185 depending on whether or not your Parallel Circuit is equipped). However at the same time, 30% of all damage TAKEN by your sentry will injure you, requiring you to quickly take care of the varmint shooting at your sentry. Another downside you'll have to deal with are butter-knifing Spies and Demoknights, because while equipped you also are less resistant to melee. So stay out of range and use those guns God gave ya! Together, I believe this set will change the Engineer playstyle a lot, because it deviates from the standard set up sentry and then spam wrench tactic and allows you to have a bit more fun, while still being credit to team. If there are any complaints or redesigns you think I should make, please let me know, and I'll edit the stats a bit to balance things out. Thanks, partner!"

It takes skill to use effectively because if you miss your pretty much boned. It also makes sense since its a blunt weapon that you whack someone with. Goes perfect with the crusaders crossbow too. But... **the vita-saw** ~~**On death up to 25% of your stored berCharge is retained**~~ ~~**Allows you to see enemy health**~~ ~~*-10 max health on wearer*~~ The vita-saw gains the old ability like it was originally intended, making it more viable and fun to fight and use along with the new Solemn Vow. It now can hold up to 25% uber. Now... **The third degree** ~~**Damage done with this weapon has a cleave effect**~~ ~~**Everyone hit with this weapon is lit on fire**~~ ~~*-33% damage penalty*~~ ~~*-40% burn time from this weapon*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~Cleave uses disintegration particles that spread in a wide cone behind the person when he is hit, touching one will do 66% damage of stock fire axe damage~~ Most melees are 1v1, this one is different. If a pyro wants to conserve ammo or is low on ammo he always has this, the slightly bad but not as bad as the volcano fragment mini room clearer. Speaking of the volcano fragment... **The sharpened volcano fragment** ~~**Pyro heals 100% afterburn damage when active**~~ ~~*-56% damage penalty*~~ A bit more passive of an item on such a powerhouse class. When you are burning someone and run away, just take this out for a bit more hp for free. But on the other hand you could mistime them burning to death or a medic will save them, not allowing you to get the kill along with a bit of health. Synergises nicely with flare guns as well. Also remember the crappiest melee of them all... **The-sun-on-a-stick** ~~**Move 10% faster while active**~~ ~~**If you have been running for a second you will pass through enemies and deal slight knock back while active**~~ ~~*Constantly lose health per second while active*~~ ~~*30% slower switch speed to and from this weapon*~~ ~~The burning is at a loss of 7 health per second and burns through BONK immunity~~ It's hot enough to make even Scout run faster and turned from a highly situational weapon to a emergency ""OH SHIT I GOTTA GO"" weapon. Be warned that the switch speed makes it so you cant just keep switching to this weapon repeatedly, you WILL slowly die. As an added bonus you can now switch weapons after 2 seconds of drinking BONK... **The Pain Train** ~~**+1 capture rate on wearer**~~ ~~**15% speed boost when carrying intel while active**~~ ~~*10% bullet damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ Now it's not 100% useless on CTF, rejoice. Notice it says while active on the second property, this is to prevent people from taking the intel and using it to help spawn camp... **The neon annihilator** ~~**130% more damage against wet players**~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~*10% damage penalty vs players*~~ ~~If killed when wet it counts as a critical kill~~ Still 1 shots lighter classes but if heavier classes can live and get away after the first hit they have more HP, plus this thing was just a better homewrecker anyways. Still counts as a critical for all those sharks with strange parts. **The Disciplinary Action** ~~**On Hit Ally: Boosts both players' speed for several seconds**~~ ~~*-25% damage penalty*~~ ~~The ally hit boxes now match its actual range~~ Not much to say about this one besides it's now more reliable. ------------------------------------------------------------ Here it is, the expansion of my ""Sub Contest #3"" entry.

But, this ONLY does increased damage to FULL HEALT or OVERHEALED players, effectively making it different from The Shahanshah. I thought that this could be used well with the BFB, being able to run in and deal lots of damage to the medic and over-healed opponents. But, as their health goes down, your bat becomes obsolete. It is really a quick, sneaky, support type weapon. I would love to hear any and all feedback!"
855,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[IDEA] Rocket Launcher based on Enemy Speed,6,2rd0i1,http://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/2rd0i1/idea_rocket_launcher_based_on_enemy_speed/,2015-01-05 13:47:14,"So, I came up with this idea for a new rocket launcher earlier today: The Prize Shot * Damage based on speed of other class * Faster classes take extra damage equivalent to their extra speed - Slower enemies take significantly reduced damage * Damage reductions are negated for classes which are explosive jumping * -25% explosive knockback Essentially, the rocket's damage would be based on the present speed of the other class, where faster classes would take more damage, but slower classes would take significantly reduced damage. As it stands, I was thinking damage increase could be equal to the amount over 100% for classes faster than average and the decrease could be TWICE the difference between their speed and the average for classes below 100%. For example, a vanilla scout would yield a 33% damage bonus. Shooting at a medic would earn you a 7% damage bonus. Any temporary speed bonuses, such as a demo charge would also yield a bonus for damage. If you can manage to hit a BFB scout, you will get a massive 73% boost to damage - if you can actually make the shot. However, you will pay severely against slower classes. You will do 14% less damage against demos, 40% less damage against soldiers without any speed buffs, and 46% less damage verses heavies. Airshots are still effective as any enemy which is rocket or sticky jumping will take normal damage. (You will not do extra damage against detonator pyros or wrangler engineers, only do normal damage on demos and other soldiers). However, an explosive knockback reduction was implemented to make it more difficult to juggle these classes. Soldiers utilizing the disciplinary action or the escape plan will give you slightly more damage. If a demo decides to take out the Scotsman's Skullcutter, you will do very little damage against him. Taking care of demoknights with a large number of heads should be much easier. Did that pyro just take out the powerjack? 15% bonus damage (stacking with the 20% damage vulnerability)! Unfortunately, killing engineers hauling buildings got a bit tougher, so you may have to wait until he plants it to wreak havoc! Don't even try to ruin a Conga party. This weapon would reward players taking on more difficult targets while encouraging them to avoid fights with bulkier classes. It would offer a niche strategy against scouts and medics, but would require them to rely on their secondary weapons or their teammates to take care of threats the rocket launcher is generally very effective against. Even though your speed is 80%, you will take normal self-damage from rocket jumps. The boost/reduction would be based on the class's current maximum [NORMAL](URL speed, regardless of if they are travelling at that or not - you could not reduce the damage of the shot simply by stopping, walking backwards, or swimming. Note that the damage reduction is capped at 50%. So a heavy spinning the minigun does NOT cause a 100% reduction in damage."

Somehow. Maybe something like [this](URL with the magnet underneath. +While active: Auto-collect dropped weapons and ammo packs within a radius around you -25% damage penalty -While active: +20% bullet vulnerability (after all, bullets are metal) ------------- The idea behind this pistol is to get Engies quick metal, as well as grab metal from places he would have a hard time getting back from. For example, building a sentry on the second floor of a room, and Engy could pull out this pistol to grab a pack from the bottom floor without having to move, resulting in a faster setup. I could also see this working well with the Gunslinger due to a dropped weapon being 100 metal. I'm not too sure about the downsides balance-wise, I'd love some feedback."
857,vulnerability,TF2WeaponIdeas,[Idea] Guerrilla Pyro set.,2,2skran,http://www.reddit.com/r/TF2WeaponIdeas/comments/2skran/idea_guerrilla_pyro_set/,2015-01-16 11:37:09,"Pyro is a very versatile class, capable of doing massive damage to many people at once, being a sneaky pick class, or defending his team from stickyspammers and sentry nests. His weapons can be mixed and matched to fit a lot of different play styles, yet something feels missing. He doesn't have weapons that fit a more defensive team or player. Somebody who like hanging back from the front lines to catch players unaware, or cause brief area denial to smaller chokepoints. Enter the Guerrilla Pyro. **Primary: The Smoker.** Pros: *+Replaces secondary fire with the ability to spray gas into the air, which can be briefly ignited to inflame the entire cloud at once. This gas dissipates after 3 seconds. +30% secondary fire speed.* Cons: *-50% less secondary ammo. -40% slower firing speed. -Primary fire is replaced with the ability to create a small spray of sparks which do 30% less damage and have a 70% lower reach.* Appearance: *Smaller and more compact than the stock flamethrower, with a more solid muzzle and a large gas tank on the underside. Has a dark green and grey paint style, with black tape around the handle areas.* Yes, this is a MAJOR change from any of the other flamethrowers. Instead of being able to do continuous damage over short periods of time, you can damage many people at once or completely block entire areas at once. Using this weapon alters the pyro's play style to being completely prediction and trap based, allowing for him to make certain areas dangerous to move through or extremely disorienting. His reach is potentially much higher than before, allowing for him to use a flare gun to ignite clouds of gas from a distance to cover strategic points such as health packs from a safe distance. **Secondary: The Slugshot.** Pros: *+50% firing speed. +200% max primary ammo. +25% more damage.* +Can ignite gas clouds. Cons: *-Does not set enemies on fire. -No crits on burning targets. -No passive reload.* Appearance: *Has a shotgun-style stock and a flare gun body, with a slightly elongated muzzle. Has a shotgun-style bottom-loading hatch, and is loaded like a shotgun. Follows the coloration and design of the first weapon.* Shotgun or Flare gun? Why not both. This weapon is a mix between the flare gun and the shotgun, obviously. It excels at mid ranges, and can be devastating at short ones. It's main draw is that it bridges the gap between the ranged capabilities of the flaregun and the reliability of the shotgun. It's stats are based off the flare gun's, for simplicity's sake. It's main draw is it's reliability at more ranges than the shotgun, while still having more ammo capacity than the flare gun. If you can aim well with it, it's extremely deadly. **Melee: The Slinger.** Pros: +30% faster attack speed. +20% faster weapon switch time (only for switching to this weapon). Cons: -15% damage. -No random critical hits. Appearance: *Is a machette. Has a longish handle and is still used with both hands. When taken out, it looks like you're drawing it from a sheath.* Pretty simple. A good, solid melee weapon which can be treated as a sidegrade to the stock. It has no vulnerability issues for the wearer, unlike the powerjack, and doesn't take away from anything pyros might rely on, such as medics healing them or doing consistent damage. Like the secondary weapon in this set, it's goal is reliability under pressure, since it can be quickly whipped out to deal with enemies who get too close for comfort. *So, that's it. Let me know if you have any criticisms or ideas. Thanks for reading, bye!* "

Stats: ~~**25% Damage returned as health on wearer**~~ ~~**25% Partner's damage returned as health to wearer**~~ ~~**75% Partner's damage returned as health to partner**~~ ~~Returned health can overheal both the medic and the partner~~ ~~*-100% Heal rate*~~ ~~*50% Fire damage vulnerability on wearer*~~ **On Ubercharge:** *Partner's attacks all cause bleed for 5 seconds on hit. Consecutive hits refresh bleed duration. Also spawns an offensive aura which damages nearby enemies by 2 health per tick.* ------------- A medigun that can't heal players directly (and so can't build Uber unless they/their partner deals enough damage), but adds an effect similar to Mad Milk or Vampire (in Mannpower Mode) to the heal partner. Also good for battle Medics - you'll still receive 20% health back even if it's your own damage. The ubercharge effect makes it even harder to kill the Medic or their partner, since they'll be draining health from every enemy they hit. If there are enough enemies nearby, the damage aura will further increase the Medic's health regen (but doesn't affect the partner). The health drain doesn't apply to buildings, though, so as with the Kritz, the Bloodletter is weak against sentry nests. Also, leeches hate fire, so try to stay away from enemy Pyros. "
