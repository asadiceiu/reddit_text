As it gets closer to entering it begins to corrupt the world around them, potentially corrupting the players. Due to this, I needed a table of Random corruptions for the players to roll. I figured since I took the time to make the list I might share it with the rest of you. I should note that a couple of these were stolen from the UA dark gifts but most of them are my own creation. **Player Corruptions** 1.)

The Characters natural Ac becomes 12 and they become resistant to cold damage but their movement on land is haved and their charisma is reduced by 3 88.) The character gains a glimpse of the beyond, and their eyes have tiny little stars in them. Once per day the character can attempt to tap into that memory to have the DM answer a yes or no question about the character's immediate future.

The characters' visage constantly switches to whatever horror the viewer perceives to be their worst nightmare. Anyone directly viewing the character must make a wisdom save DC 12 or suffer a temporary madness. 96.) The characters eyes now move independently on stalks that hang a foot out of their eye sockets. The character is able to look in two directions at the same time but the loss of proper depth perception and disorienting feeling of their new eyes makes them suffer disadvantage on perception checks. 97.) The characters arms grow overly large and long until they are just above the ground. The character gains 5 of reach on melee attacks but the strain of their muscles ripping reduces their strength by 2 and dex by 1. 98.) The force of the corruption becomes too much for the character to contain and they transform into a hostile gibbering mouther. Nothing short of a wish spell can bring the character back to life. 99.) The force of the corruption and the glimpse of the beyond is so potent that the character gains 1 level. However, they are stricken with two permanent madnesses 100.) Roll Twice"
2,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,Nilbog Patron - Looking for Advice,1,ijj0de,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/ijj0de/nilbog_patron_looking_for_advice/,2020-08-31 05:41:02,"So I have been toying with the idea of a Nilbog Patron for warlock, and I decided to go ahead and brainstorm some ideas and narrow them down to a few. The theme I decided to focus on involves some combination of the charmed condition, psychic damage, damage avoidance, and madness effects, with the flavor leaning towards that of the Nilbog spirit being a corrupting, maddening influence on the player and those around them. Obviously, not all these features would be used, I have just listed the ones I think could work best. Immediately, there are some similarities in focus to the Archfey and Great Old One patron focuses, which also share in some charm and psychic damage focus. However, I am attempting to make the Nilbog the combat equivalent of the GOOlock's interaction/social dominance. GOOlock has excellent 1st and 14th level features for social aspects of the game, while the 6th and 10th level features are notoriously bad combat ones. The Archfey patron... well, in my opinion, it's always been grossly underpowered compared to nearly all of the other patrons, despite being plenty flavorful. I have taken much of my inspiration for features from the Nilbog monster from Volos Guide, and the spell list and class features reflect that. Ideally, Id like to keep as many of those similarities there as I can, to really give the impression that the player is calling on the same powers that those twisted caricatures do. In addition to whatever people feel like they want to address, there are a few specific points I'd like to get advice on: 1. The expanded spell list feels fairly solid to me, with some cross-overs from GOO and Archfey while still being it's own thing. The only spell level that I am still undecided on is 2nd level spells, where I am stuck between Mind Thrust, Phantasmal Force, and Pyrotechnics. Mind Thrust gives scaling psychic damage which fits within the subclass focus, Phantasmal Force is thematic in the way it convinces a creature that their reality is unstable and can cause almost madness-like effects in those it is cast on, and Pyrotechnics is just a versatile and thematic spell that creates chaos, like a Nilbog would. It's a touch to choose between 2 of the 3, and any additional arguments one way or another would be helpful. 2. Giving two features at a level is a potential answer to my choice paralysis for some levels. Namely, I think itd be ideal if Biting Words and Nilbogism were both included at 1st level, in the same manner that the Celestialock gets two cantrips and a healing pool at 1st level. Likewise, Sanity Breakdown and Calloused Mind are both minor enough effects that I could see them being an additional feature instead of a main one. Any advice on the balance of two features would be appreciated. Anyway, without further ado, here is my noted draft of the Nilbog patron for warlock. **Nilbog Patron** ***Your patron is one of the powerful trickster spirits that haunt goblinkind, a chaotic and mischievous phantom that revels in madness and arrogance. Such spirits are born of strange magics and goblin suffering, and are notorious for their ability to possess the bodies of goblins and inflict nilbogism on them, granting them curious powers and twisted cheer even as their minds warp beyond recognition. For one reason or another, the spirit possessing you seems not to have touched your mind or has it?*** &amp;#x200B; **Restriction: Goblins Only** Only Goblins can choose the Nilbog as a patron. Such spirits are only able to target Goblins for possession. Your DM can lift this restriction to better suit the campaign. The restriction exists because the creator thought it was pretty self-explanatory. It might not apply to your DM's setting or they just might not give a shit. *- This is pretty self explanatory I feel. I am typically against limiting subclasses to specific races, as it often feels like flavor that has gone too far and started stifling player creativity, but with the Nilbog I mean, read the name backwards. The Nilbog lore itself is inherent to goblins, so itd feel forced and strange to allow a different race to gain what is so specific to the little green shits. But as stated, DMs are fickle and capricious beasts, and both can and often do dunk traditional lore in a pot of homebrewed sauce. At the end of the day, it's whatever works for your game.* &amp;#x200B; **Expanded Spell List** The Nilbog lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you. **Nilbog Expanded Spells** **Spell Level - Spells** 1st - Dissonant Whispers, Tashas Hideous Laughter 2nd - Mind Thrust, Phantasmal Force, Pyrotechnics, 3rd - Catnap, Fast Friends 4th - Freedom of Movement, Phantasmal Killer 5th - Dominate Person, Mislead *- The spell list is fairly straightforward and done for the most part. As I said above, two of the three 2nd level spells need to be selected, as they all have their own merits, but other than that, I dont think this needs much advice.* &amp;#x200B; ***1st Level Feature Ideas:*** **Biting Words** Starting at 1st level, you learn the Vicious Mockery cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different Warlock cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known. You may add your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) to damage rolls made with it. **OR** The damage dice for the spell is increased to 1d6, and scales appropriately. *- Nilbogs have vicious mockery as a cantrip, and giving that cantrip just makes sense, with its dual focus on damage prevention and psychic damage. The only concern is that vicious mockery is a notoriously low damage cantrip. In a combat oriented subclass of the class with exclusive access to the most potent damage cantrip in the game, with feature that improve said cantrip, vicious mockery would be weak to start and only get weaker as the game goes on, especially when mind sliver is already a warlock cantrip that does psychic damage and scales better. So I ended up deciding to buff vicious mockerys damage, but got stuck between one of two ways to do it. By adding Charisma modifier to damage, the spell gains a level of damage consistency and an early level damage boost that very briefly puts it over eldritch blast, which it gradually falls off from with Invocations and additional dice. By increasing the damage die size, the spell still loses to eldritch blast and matches mind sliver in damage, but scales more smoothly over time. Both options could potentially work, and Id welcome any advice on which one works better.* **Tricks of the Trade** Starting at 1st level, the Nilbog spirit whispers knowledge of its abilities into your mind. You may choose a skill to gain proficiency in and a skill to double your proficiency modifier in from the following skills: Stealth, Deception, Sleight of Hand, or Performance. You may choose the same skill for this. *- This is a simple easy feature that feels like it would be fine to tack on in addition to one of the other two 1st level feature ideas. It is functionally a worse Expertise, in that it only grants a proficiency and an expertise, and must be chosen from a specific list of 4 skills. I believe there is a similar feature out there that grants skills from a short list, but I am unable to find it.* **Nilbogism** Starting at 1st level, you can use a bonus action to radiate maddening majesty. For the next minute, any creature that attempts to damage you must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be charmed until the start of that creatures next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this feature for the next 24 hours. A creature charmed in this way spends the rest of its turn praising you. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. *- One of the two infamous nilbog traits. Part of the reason the nilbog creature is notorious is due to the fact that every time some attempts to attack the bugger, they must make a Charisma saving throw or spend the remainder of their current and next turn charmed and using their action on praising the bastard. A permanent, souped up sanctuary in a sense. This feature is a weakened, temporary replica of that effect. Mechanically, its pretty much a once per day sanctuary that charms for a round and allows the caster to attack, in exchange for having attackers become immune to the effect the first time they fail it. Potent, but not overwhelming as I see it.* &amp;#x200B; ***6th Level Feature Ideas:*** **Reversal of Fortune** At 6th level, you learn how to mimic some of the luck-bending abilities of the Nilbog spirit. When a creature deals damage to you, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage to 0 and regain 1d6 hit points. If you do so, you cannot regain hit points except through this feature for 1 minute. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest. *- The second infamous nilbog trait, the monster has the ability to use a reaction to reduce any damage dealt by a creature to 0 and gain 1d6 hp. In combination with the nilbogism charm trait of the monster, the nilbog is a hard creature to damage. This feature is also the one I am having the greatest difficulty balancing. One one hand, having 1-5 times that you can negate damage as a reaction is exceptionally strong. The prevention of healing for a minute after use does help mitigate its power and ensure that the feature is used with caution, but it is still without a doubt very strong. On the other hand, limiting it to once a short rest has it lose a lot of its spark and flavor as a subclass thats good at avoiding damage. Ive considered a rework, and have also considered moving the feature to 10th level and bringing Sanity Breakdown down to 6th, but at this point, some advice would go a long way.* **Calloused Mind (Combat/Interaction)** At 6th level, your proximity to joyful madness incarnate has strengthened your mental fortitude. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened and have resistance to psychic damage. *- Pretty straightforward, not much to go into here. Advantage against fear and charm is just good, albeit minor. Same with the psychic damage resistance. GOOlock gives the same resistance at 10th along with a backlash for mental probing, but as Ive stated, GOOlock specializes in interaction/social scenarios, and sucks comparatively in combat.* &amp;#x200B; ***10th Level Feature Ideas:*** **Madness for the Mindless** Starting at 10th level, your understanding of the madness within you allows you to rattle the sanity of those without thought. Your spells and class features are able to impose the charmed and frightened conditions on creatures that are immune to them, and deal psychic damage to creatures with psychic damage immunity as though they had resistance. *- This feature, while not exceptionally exciting, does seem very useful. Immunity bypass is powerful after all, even if it is turned into resistance and it is specifically for a damage type that is uncommon and traditionally low in output. The charming and frightening of creatures normally immune to those conditions is another case of niche but powerful; some games might make that aspect moot, while it could be especially powerful in others.* **Sanity Breakdown** Starting at 10th level, whenever you deal psychic damage to an enemy creature, you can roll a 1d10. If you roll a 10, the target is inflicted with a random short term madness. If you roll a 1, the damage you deal is halved. *- I am incredibly fond of this feature, and would love to keep it in some way if I can. I think the balance between a 10% chance to do half damage and a 10% chance to inflict a debilitating condition when using a specific, uncommon damage type is pretty balanced. If anything, I would like opinions on whether this would work better as a 6th level feature, as it is ultimately somewhat like a conditional AND randomized reckless attack feature for certain spells. Ive also considered keeping it at 10th level and also keeping Madness for the Mindless, though if I chose to do that, Id likely need to weaken MftM.* &amp;#x200B; ***14th Level Feature Ideas:*** **Fracture Sanity** At 14th level, you gain the ability to devastate someones mind. You can use your action to inflict a random long term madness on an opponent within 30 feet. While a creature is afflicted with this madness, they lose resistance and become vulnerable to psychic damage so long as they are not immune to it. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. *- I am fairly certain that this is the feature I will keep for the capstone. Its simple and effective, and has both combat and interaction/social uses while also being thematic. The only concern might be that it doesnt allow a save, but in that regard, I am just taking a page from other patron caps like Create Thrall and Hurl Through Hell. Create Thrall gives a no save, at will permanent charm that allows practically unlimited communication, while Fracture Sanity gives a no save, once per day vulnerability to a specific damage type and a random but likely debilitating debuff.* **Madness Given Form** At 14th level, you and the Nilbog spirit are able to briefly synchronize to form something between goblin and trickster spirit. As a bonus action, you transform into a figure of roiling shadows and crazed laughter for 1 minute. You gain the following benefits while transformed: * You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. * You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. You can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an object. * You are immune to psychic damage as well as to the frightened and charmed conditions. * All creatures that start their turn within 20 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw.or behave as though affected by the spell *Confusion*. Creatures affected this way are also considered to be charmed by you and will not attack you regardless of spell effect or madness. As a bonus action on your turn, you may choose a creature affected this way to make another Wisdom saving throw or be inflicted with a random short term madness. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. *- Only note I really have for this feature is that it's pretty similar to the UA Undead patron. It's also not something that's actually super useful, considering that it's best used when a lot of enemies and no allies are very near you- not an ideal position for any warlock except a Hexblade, which you are not. Despite being pretty flavorful, Im likely choosing Fracture Sanity as the capstone.* ***Optional Rule:*** **Growing Madness** The presence of a Nilbog spirit in your body will wear on your sanity as you grow in power. Perhaps that sanity is only holding you back? Starting at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th, you may choose to take on a random indefinite madness. Madness granted this way cannot be removed in any way short of severing your connection with your patron. Each time you do so, you can roll an additional time whenever rolling on a madness table and choose which number to use. *- This optional rule was just something that I thought might be a neat way to enhance RP and give a relatively small but useful bonus in exchange for some character corruption. Obviously this wouldn't be able to be included in the actual core subclass, as it provides a mechanical benefit at an RP cost, making it much better in a hack'n'slash game than an intrigue game. Still, I think that it could be something fun to consider for those participating in games where RP actually plays a significant part.* Any feedback at all would be a huge help!"

In my personal campaigns and worlds, the Elves aren't as connected to the Fey and are a magical race that came into being on their own, but Eladrin remain as Elves that ventured into the Feywild and stayed there. But. I hopefully would really like some feedback on to balancing this race and how to build it not only to be more playable but maybe less broken if it ends up being like that :/ So without anymore rambling, I present the FaeBorn: FaeBorn are to the Fae what Tieflings and Aasimar are to Demons and Celestials Never let it be said that the Fey didnt meddle in the affairs of mortals. Though the Eladrin might be similar to FaeBorn, the differences are clear. Eladrin are clear descendants of elves and a distinct member of the species. FaeBorn are the result of what happens when nobles, members, and Archfey of the Seelie and Unseelie courts fraternize with the life forms outside the realm of the FeyWild. FaeBorn are clearly different from humans, and like Tieflings, may be shunned and barred from a society that is particularly fearful of the Fey. Antler like horns sprout from their heads during adolescence, and they retain the otherworldly radiance and posture that their lineage holds. Their direct appearance correlates with the court that their patron pertains to The courts reside under different domains. The overarching two being Light and Dark, and those under them relating to the seasons of nature. Light: relating to the courts of the Seelie, those with fae patronage of Light have the appearance of someone who stands in a field of flowers embracing the sunlight. Summer Light courts feel like calm breezy days. Winter Light courts feel like undisturbed and quiet morning. Those under spring feel like morning dew, and those of fall feel like chilly quiet rustling dawn. The descendants of these relay those features clearly, with light, sometimes even white, hair ranging from light brown, to strawberry blonde, to pure blonde. Those with fairer skin under the summer and spring and fall domains are usually marked with freckles and have a wide range of lightly coloured eyes, however, only those under the winter domain have icy blue coloured eyes. Dark: relating to the courts of the Unseelie, those with Dark fae patronage resemble creatures of the night and underdark, with darker hued skin such as purple and blue and darker black, brown and, sometimes dirty blonde hair that can range other unnatural colors. Summer Dark courts feel like campfire lit midnight. Winter Dark courts can feel like cocoa and firelight. Spring Dark courts can feel like breezy moonlit nights and Fall Dark courts can feel like comforting and fuzzy love. Though the courts of the Seelie and Unseelie are written here as positive, they can be reflected both through the FaeBorn and Fae themselves as unsettling, cold, and unwelcoming. Evil and Good exist in droves in the Fey and dont directly correlate to Light and Dark, and rather exist in a balance that shifts like the seasons themselves. Racial traits: All FaeBorn gain the following racial traits Ability Score Increase: Your Charisma score raises by 2 Age: FaeBorn mature about the same as humans but can live up to 200 Size: Youre about the same size and build as a human. Your size is Medium Speed: Your base Walking speed is 30ft Fey Lineage: You know the druidcraft cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast Faerie Fire once per long rest and can do the same with Misty Step when you reach 5th level, Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells Languages: you can speak common and sylvan Dark vision: you can see in the up to 60 ft in dim light as if it were bright light and darkness as if it were dim light (maybe) Subrace Racial Traits/Abilities -Light: Bright Shield: FaeBorn under the domain of light have resistance to radiant damage but vulnerability to psychic damage (2x damage) -Dark: Bulwark of Shadow: FaeBorn under the domain of dark have resistance to necrotic damage and vulnerability to lightning damage (2x damage) -Spring: Flowers of Resistance: FaeBorn under the domain of Spring gain advantage on saving throws against magic -Summer: Revel in Sunlight: FaeBorn under the domain of Spring gain a +4 on perception checks when in the presence of direct sunlight -Fall: Dusk and Smoke: FaeBorn under the Domain of Fall gain the use of the Create Bonfire Cantrip -Winter: Frost Armor: FaeBorn under the domain of Winter gain the ability to gain +2 to AC for 1 hour as a reaction, that can be used once per long rest"
4,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,Advice on balancing equipment enchantment quest reward,1,hll8xr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/hll8xr/advice_on_balancing_equipment_enchantment_quest/,2020-07-05 21:38:54,"I have designed a quest involving the party saving a village of tritons from a creature in a lake that connects to the ocean. These tritons are being terrorised and cant access the cave to worship and pray to their spirit/god because something has taken up residence in it. At the end of the cave, the party finds a shrine and a mystical pool of water. The water spirit worshipped by this triton village blesses equipment dipped into the pool, chosen by the player from the list below but they won't know exactly what the enchantments do at first (each player can pick only one). The issue is that I'm not sure how well balanced these enchantments are (particularly the armour/shield enchantment). Melee weapon: Faint glow (sheds dim light up to 30 ft) and for the purpose of resistances weapon damage also becomes magic (like silvered weapons) Ranged weapons: any ammunition shot from this weapon is also treated as magical, but the weapon now also allows a single cast of true strike as a bonus action once per long rest. Armour/shield: the armour seems to glisten as if coated with a magical water, it feels slightly wet to the touch. You gain resistance to fire damage and to lightning damage, but a vulnerability to cold damage whilst wearing this armour. \[too much? one resistance and no vulnerability might be better?\] Boots: whilst wearing these boots you can choose to walk across liquids as if under the influence of the water walk spell. Helmet: whilst wearing this helmet you can breathe underwater as if under the influence of the water breathing spell"
5,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,"Custom Subclasses, And The Process Of Making Them.",1,hn7ax8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/hn7ax8/custom_subclasses_and_the_process_of_making_them/,2020-07-08 11:04:59,"I've only been practicing making custom subclasses for maybe 2 and a half months now. Over the course of this time, I have received tons of great criticism and wonderful tips and tricks on how to make more balanced incohesive subclasses. Within that time I have greatly perfected the skill, but I'm still always open to criticism in learning more tricks to make more unique yet balance subclasses. So within my time and practice, I've brought it down to a refined science. (At least in a way that makes sense to me) Whenever I create a subclass I follow these five pillars. (1) Does it have a strong theme. (2) Does it have clearly defined features and abilities that can be understood by the reader. (3) Can the subclass be easily classified as a Tank, Utility, Support etc. (4) Does the subclass have replayability. (5) Are the abilities and features listed in the subclass balanced. I then quickly upload what I've made, and hope for anyone to point out any errors or areas that I could improve upon. things like grammatical errors, abilities, or features that perhaps are not as clearly defined etc. If what I have made doesn't fit these 5 pillars, then I continuously go back to the drawing board until it is fully refined and perfected. The most important pillar that I've discovered is not so much the balancing, but the actual theme itself. If you don't know what you're theme is, then you don't really know what you're making. For example... If your theme is a barbarian who can turn into Beast Warrior. Let's say a Werewolf Barbarian subclass. Based off some of the most popular interpretations of werewolves, we already have a really strong theme to work with. Werewolves have incredible sense of smell and hearing, they can see in the dark, and they have powerful muscles and claws. Half of that already fits with the Barbarian background. When you rage your body shifts and changes into that of a werewolf. You gain deadly claws. Your unarmored strike (1D10) slashing damage. As an added bonus you have resistance to all damage. You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. You gain vulnerability to silver. So long as you start with a powerful theme, you're already a step ahead of the game. So this is my ritual for making any subclass, but what do you guys think? What are the ways that you lay out your subclass foundation, or what are ways that you create your own subclasses in general? Let me know when the comment section."
6,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,UPDATED MAGE CLASS,1,hq18yz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/hq18yz/updated_mage_class/,2020-07-13 06:19:28,"hey, yall. finished my mage class, but did have to swap a fair bit of stuff around Mage. A sleazy little fellow, hunted by the guards, creates a wall of bricks in front of a small passage way he ducked into. Moments later, he flies off as a bird. An old man stands before the group of goblins as his hands light ablaze and he flings out a shockwave of flames, followed by turning the remaining goblin into a flower pot. A shopkeeper sits at his desk, noticing once again that some adventurers are trying to steal his wares. Moments later, hes in the doorway, twice his size, and a massive axe in his hand. The Mage, a true master of magics, capable of shaping it in a near infinite number of ways. They use their count max to create more and more complicated and powerful spells as they increase in level, and in power. Not as strong as any true full caster, they make up for this by their adaptability. Certainly, a level 5 wizards fireball will be more than any mage can create, but that mage can create a wall of stone or fire nearly on demand. **LEVEL ABILITIES COUNT MAX** 1 Max count, Spell Induction 3 2 Focus 4 3 Minor Spell 5 4 ASI 6 5 Over Count 7 6 Minor Spell 8 7 Focus Feature 9 8 ASI 10 9 Minor Spell 11 10 Welded Spell 14 11 Focus Feature 17 12 ASI, Welded Spell 20 13 23 14 Welded Spell 26 15 Nexus 29 16 Welded Spell 32 17 Focus Feature 35 18 Welded Spell 38 19 ASI 41 20 Arcane Triumph 50 HP Hit Dice: D6 HP at first level: 6+ con mod HP at higher levels: 1D6 + con mod Proficiencies Armor: none Weapon: Dagger Tools: none Saving throws: INT, CON Skills: Choose 2 from: Arcana, History, Deception, Insight, Investigation., or Perception. Equipment: Dagger (a) Jewel focus, (b) gem focus, or (c) pearl focus. Backpack. MAX COUNT: A mage is defined by their max count a restriction on how complicated their spell can be. This list, which increases with levels (as shown above) lets a mage create their spells. IMPORTANT NOTE: THE MAX COUNT LIST IS NOT HOW MANY POINT THEY **HAVE**, BUT RATHER HOW MANY CAN BE USED IN ONE OF THEIR SPELLS. To give an example, a level 5 mage has 7 Max points. Using the table at the end of this class, he made a fire spell. It takes 1 point for damage, 1 for fire, 1 to deal 1D6 damage, 1 to make it a dex save, and 3 to make its range 90 feet. This would be one that goes up to his max points for that turn. On the next turn, he casts a lightning spell. 1 point for damage, 2 for lighting, 1 for 1D6, 1 to make it a dex save, and 3 for 90. That would be 8 points, 1 over his Max, so he cannot do that. He lowers the range to 60 feet, making the max 7, letting him cast the spell. SPELLCASTING ABILITY: Though mages do not use their own power to cast magic, some of their feats do require mental fortitude. As such, intelligence is your spell casting stat. Most spells will require an attack roll, or a saving throw. **SPELL SAVE DC:** 8+ prof bonus + int mod **SPELL ATTACK MOD**: prof bonus + int mod. FOCUS: A mage uses a physical object to cast his spells through, and without it, becomes useless, as they cannot cast spells until they regain one. Though you can use any jewel, gem, or pearl to cast spells, Mages will focus on one of them, using the other 2 only if they do not have access to their normal one. At second level, choose either the Gem, Jewel, or Pearl Focus Subclass. Each is detailed just before the spell part costs. MINOR SPELL: A mage will, over the earlier parts of his life, learn some minor spells, with a simplistic use. At level 3, and again at levels 6 and 9, you may choose one of the following minor spells, which use up points as listed, but cost a bonus action to cast, rather than a full action. Wings: your movement speed is replaced with a flight speed equal to half your movement speed, rounded down. (2 points) Fins: your movement speed is replaced with a swimming speed equal to half your movement speed, rounded down. (1 point) Claws: your movement speed is replaced with a digging speed equal to a third of your movement speed, rounded down. (2 points) Manipulate: you gain an invisible mage hand, that you can move at will during your turn, though while carrying an object, it can only move at a speed of 10 feet (1 point) ASI: At level 4, and again at levels 8, 12, 16, and 19, you can increase one ability score by 2, or 2 ability scores by one each. If your DM allows the optional feat rule, you may instead take a feat, so long as you meet the requirements. OVER FOCUS: At level 5, you gain the ability to remain absolutely still, charging up to cast a strong spell than you normally could. Requiring no action, you focus all of your being at the start of your turn, and you gain 1 extra Max Count at its end, which remains until you take ANY ACTION, BONUS ACTION, REACTION, FREE INTERACTION, OR MOVEMENT, OR TAKE DAMAGE. You may have a number of extra Max Counts equal to your intelligence modifier. WELDED SPELL: At level 10, and again at levels 12, 14, 16, and 18, you may create a Welded Spell, a special spell induction that allows to you use **2** categories of spell types, such as damage and heal, letting you create a vampiric like spell. Or perhaps conjure and divine, letting you see something a long distance off, and summon it to your hand. You have a number of uses of the spells (all drawing from the same pool) equal to your intelligence modifier, and may change 1 of your welded spells over the course of 8 hours, remaining in focus during that time (same rules as crafting an item, and the such). The Welded Spell must still be lower or equal to your Max Count, and uses slots on your turn as a normal spell would. NEXUS: At level 15, you gain the use of a nexus, a special portal or magic. You may lower your Max Count until you take a long rest, taking the amount it is lowered by, and placing it in the Nexus. Once the Nexus reaches 100 points within it, you may spend 8 hours (you count as unconscious, though stable during this time) of pure absolute focus, and at its end, create a Nexus on the space you are standing on. Each time you place a nexus after this, the cost is 100 higher than before. you , and any creature you designate, may travel freely between nexuses. Being near a placed nexus also gives you a bonus, increasing your Max Count by 10 while you are within 100 feet of the nexus. ARCANE TRIUMPH: At the 20th level, you gain a true and ultimate mastery of Spell Induction. You may create a spell with up to 3 categories, and a max count of 100. You may cast this spell once per long rest. FOCUS, PEARL: Those who focus on using a pearl to induct spells have a closer connection to nature, and gain the following category NATURE: Nature (1) Tree 2 Flower 1 Crop 2 Vine 1 Range equal to damage range list LAND STRIDE: Starting at 7th level, moving through nonmagical Difficult Terrain costs you no extra Movement. You can also pass through nonmagical Plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. In addition, you have advantage on Saving Throws against Plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede Movement, such those created by the Entangle spell. SIMPLE PLANTING: At level 11, whenever you use the nature category in a welded spell, the kind of plant used (tree, flower) does not count towards Max Count. JUNGLE WRATH: At level 17, you can call upon your arcane power and summon a jungle to bash and slow enemies trapped within. Once per long rest, you may call up a 100 by 100 foot jungle, growing 50 feet into the air, if this would cause it to grow beyond its max size (such as if it was in a cave) it instead grows to its max size possible there. Any enemy caught in the jungle will take 1D10 damage per round, unavoidable. Anyone, enemy or otherwise, caught in the jungle can only move 10 feet per round, unless their max speed is lower. A creature who gets 15 feet below the ground (either with a digging spell, or some other way to move, or move through earth) will have the roots clear, letting them move at normal speed down there. The jungle will last for a minute, after which is quickly wilts away and disappears, until summoned again. FOCUS, JEWEL: Those who focus on the jewel path abandon the forests and mountains, preferring the mechanical, and created world, as represented by their choosing of a focus that is crafted (a jewel in this case counts as a gem that has been shaped. Think of a necklace or ring). Those who choose the jewel focus gain the following category Crafter (1) Weapon 2 Gear 1 Armor 2 Material Vegetative 1 Stone 2 Crystal 3 Metals 4 UNFORGE: At level 7, you gain the ability to unforge armor and other objects of metal, gaining half of what the object is normally worth, with it starting with platinum, then once there are less than 10 gold left in its value, gaining the rest in gold. BETTER CRAFTER: At level 11, the creation you make with your crafter category spells become stronger and more durable. Any weapons or armor you create can become +1 if you spend 5 more points, or +2 if you instead spend 15 points. RETURN TO WILD: At level 17, you may call upon the true forge to destroy the things that have been made, returning them into their original form. A 50 by 50 square whose center is within 100 feet of you has a massive hammer swing down on it, and any creature, enemy or not, wearing armor, using tools or weapons, or any gear lying on the ground or being worn/carried, is returned to its natural form (wood parts become branches and logs, armor becomes raw metals, and leather becomes animal pelts. FOCUS, GEMS: Those who focus on gems focus on the raw. The untamed, like the gems they use to channel their magic. They gain proficiency with light and medium armor and gain access to the following category when creating spells Physical (1) Bludgeoning 1 Piercing 1 Slashing 1 1D6 1 1D8 2 1D12 3 5 feet = 1 BETTER BATTLER: At level 7, when you use your action to induce a spell of only the physical category, you instead cast it twice, rather than once. TRUE HARMING: At level 11, when you cast a spell that uses the physical tree, and have Max Points left over, you can add them as extra damage, not resisted, or immuned, but not vulnerable either (the number of Max Points left is how much damage they take) TRUE CALL: At level 17, you can call upon the elements to terrorize whatever you face. You automatically know if a creature you face has a vulnerability, and when casting a spell that targets only them, can use that damage type for 1 Max Count, even if the usual is listed for costing more. If the creature has no vulnerabilities, you instead deal extra damage equal to your level to it, though this extra damage cannot be more than max damage of your dice. CATAGORIES: Damage (1) Fire 1 Ice 1 Thunder 1 Poison 1 Necrotic 1 Acid 2 Lightning 2 Radiant 2 Force 3 D6 1 D8 1 D10 1 (max of 5 dice for any category, 1 category) 30 feet = 1 Sphere = 3 Line = 2 Cone = 6 Cube = 3 Circle = 2 Healing (3) D4 1 D6 2 D8 4 10 feet = 1 Roll a number of D10 equal to dice rolled. If any are a 1, you cannot heal until you finish a long rest. Conjure (1) Wall 1 10 feet = 1 Weapon 1 Heavy 2 Gear 1 Armor 1 Medium 2 Heavy 3 Creature \[CR. if willing, half\] Self 2 20 = 1 Divine (2) Sight 1 Sound 1 Touch 3 Prediction 2 Control 3 100 feet =1 (5 for control) Transforming: Elemental (same as damage cost) Animal \[cr of target - cr of creature turned into (min 2)\] Object \[cr of target\] 15 feet = 1 Manipulation (2) Space 2 Time 3 Object 1 Mental 4"
7,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,The DIVINE CHAMPION Fighter Subclass (WIP) - A Subclass for heroes who are chosen by the gods. (Version 1.1),1,hqppqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/hqppqs/the_divine_champion_fighter_subclass_wip_a/,2020-07-14 08:51:14,"Hello, everybody! I hope you're all doing well today. Today, I'll be posting an updated, but still unfinished version of my Divine Champion fighter subclass. Here's what I got: Divine Champions appear ordinary and some may come from an average background. Some call them Apostles or Chosen Ones, as they are people blessed with the power of the gods. The gods may see greatness in their future, or devastation in the worlds future, which the Divine Champion will inevitably rise up to to defend against. &amp;#x200B; **Blessing of the Chosen** Starting at 3rd level, your godly gift of power allows you to harness different kinds of divine magic. This is fueled by the usage of **Divine Points.** The amount of Divine Points you can use is equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You can spend these points to fuel various divine features. You start knowing three features: Light of Power, Blessed Soul, and Holy Armor. When you spend a divine point, it is unavailable until you or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended divine points back into yourself. &amp;#x200B; **Intervening Divination** When you roll in ability check, you may expend 1 divine point to add your charisma modifier to the roll, even if you already used your charisma modifier on the roll. You may choose to do this after you see the total, but before the DM says if it succeeds or fails. &gt;*I scrapped the Light of Power feature, as a commenter pointed out that it was just like the Paladin's divine smite, which I agreed with.* **Blessed Soul** When you roll a saving throw, you may expend 1 divine point to add your charisma modifier to the roll, even if you already used your charisma modifier on the roll. You may choose to do this after you see the total, but before the DM says if it succeeds or fails. *Did some rewording for this one.* **Holy Armor** As a reaction after a foe attacks you, you can spend 1 divine point to increase your armor class by your Charisma modifier. &amp;#x200B; **Blessing of the Chooser** &gt;*I knew pretty early on (and I was reminded of this by a commenter) that this feature would be problematic, so I wrote out/re-wrote each trait granted by the chosen domain. Let me know if these are unbalanced, and if they could use further re-writes.* At 3rd level, depending on the deity that chose you as their champion, you gain a feature determined by a Cleric domain of your choice. You can choose one of the following domain features: * Arcana: You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill, and you gain two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. * Death: At 1st level, you learn one necromancy cantrip of your choice from any spell list. When you cast a necromancy cantrip that normally targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range. * Forge: As an Action, you can imbue magic into a weapon or some armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one nonmagical object that is a suit of armor or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if its armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if its a weapon. * Grave: As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, cursing it until the end of your next turn. The next time you or an ally of yours hits the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attack's damage, and then the curse ends. * Knowledge: You learn two languages of your choice. You also become proficient in your choice of two of the following skills: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of those skills. * Life: As an action, evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your Fighter level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. * Light: You can interpose divine light between yourself and an attacking enemy. When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to flare before the attacker before it hits or misses. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this feature. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. * Nature: As an action, you invoke the name of your deity. Each beast or plant creature that can see you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While it is charmed by you, it is friendly to you and other creatures you designate. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. * Order: You gain proficiency in the Intimidation or Persuasion skill (your choice). When you roll, you add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus. * Tempest: You can thunderously rebuke attackers. When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to cause the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d8 lightning or thunder damage (your choice) on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. * Trickery: You can create an illusory duplicate of yourself. As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you. For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. &amp;#x200B; * War: When you use the Attack action, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. &amp;#x200B; **Hero of Fate** &gt;*I nixed the Divine Champion's Hero of Faith trait, as I now want to avoid the addition of spells (unless traits from a domain grant spells) thanks to a commenter. That same commenter recommended something similar to a Bard's Bardic Inspiration, which I liked because it ties more into the Divine Champion's twisting of fate to further serve their quest.* Starting at 7th level, you can channel your godly power to alter the actions of others to favor your destiny. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Divined die, a d8. Once within the next 10 minutes, either you or the creature you choose rolls the die. If your deity was good, the creature you choose chooses when to roll the die and use it. If your deity was evil, you choose when to roll the die and use it. If your deity was good, the number rolled is added to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. If your deity was evil, the number rolled is subtracted from one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. Your Divined die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level. &amp;#x200B; **Power of the Lords** Starting at 10th level, as your adventures continue, your divine power grows stronger. You gain two additional uses of your Blessing of the Chosen ability. **Mystical Light** &gt;*This usage of Divine Points will be totally nixed later in favor of a different usage (any recommendations?), as as I stated earlier, I want to avoid the usage of spells with this subclass (an exception being traits from the Arcana domain).* Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 2 divine points to cast the Guiding Bolt spell as a bonus action. You can spend additional divine points to cast Guiding Bolt as a higher level spell. Each additional divine point you spend increases the spell's level by 1. The maximum number of divine points (2 plus any additional points) that you can spend on the spell equals half your Fighter level. **Domain Power** &gt;*Obviously, this is still unfinished.* Depending on the domain of the deity that chose you, you can spend 2 divine points to do one of the following: * Arcana: * Death: * Forge: *Demiurgy:* As an Action, you can harness a small piece of the godly powers of creation. You can conjure 1 melee weapon of your choice, and the chosen user is proficient with it. The weapon is magical, deals either radiant or necrotic damage (if you were chosen by a good deity, it deals radiant damage. Necrotic for evil) rather than bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, gains a +2 to attack and damage rolls, and disappears after 1 hour. * Grave: * Knowledge: * Life: * Light: * Nature: * Order: * Tempest: * Trickery: * War: &amp;#x200B; **So how's this new version?** Is it any better? **Could it still use some re-writes before I advance into later levels?** **Do you have any ideas for features for this subclass?** Tell me all about your thoughts in the comments, and I'll be there!"

The gods may see greatness in their future, or devastation in the worlds future, which the Divine Champion will inevitably rise up to to defend against. **Blessing of the Chosen** Starting at 3rd level, your godly gift of power allows you to harness different kinds of divine magic. This is fueled by the usage of **Divine Points.** The amount of Divine Points you can use is equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You can spend these points to fuel various divine features. You start knowing three features: Light of Power, Blessed Soul, and Holy Armor. When you spend a divine point, it is unavailable until you or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended divine points back into yourself. **Intervening Divination** When you roll in ability check, you may expend 1 divine point to add your charisma modifier to the roll, even if you already used your charisma modifier on the roll. You may choose to do this after you see the total, but before the DM says if it succeeds or fails. &gt;*I scrapped the Light of Power feature, as a commenter pointed out that it was just like the Paladin's divine smite, which I agreed with.* **Blessed Soul** When you roll a saving throw, you may expend 1 divine point to add your charisma modifier to the roll, even if you already used your charisma modifier on the roll. You may choose to do this after you see the total, but before the DM says if it succeeds or fails. *Did some rewording for this one.* **Holy Armor** As a reaction after a foe attacks you, you can spend 1 divine point to increase your armor class by your Charisma modifier. **Blessing of the Chooser** &gt;*I knew pretty early on (and I was reminded of this by a commenter) that this feature would be problematic, so I wrote out/re-wrote each trait granted by the chosen domain. Let me know if these are unbalanced, and if they could use further re-writes.* At 3rd level, depending on the deity that chose you as their champion, you gain a feature determined by a Cleric domain of your choice. You can choose one of the following domain features: * Arcana: You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill, and you gain two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. * Death: At 1st level, you learn one necromancy cantrip of your choice from any spell list. When you cast a necromancy cantrip that normally targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range. * Forge: As an Action, you can imbue magic into a weapon or some armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one nonmagical object that is a suit of armor or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if its armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if its a weapon. * Grave: As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, cursing it until the end of your next turn. The next time you or an ally of yours hits the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attack's damage, and then the curse ends. * Knowledge: You learn two languages of your choice. You also become proficient in your choice of two of the following skills: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of those skills. * Life: As an action, evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your Fighter level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. * Light: You can interpose divine light between yourself and an attacking enemy. When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to flare before the attacker before it hits or misses. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this feature. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. * Nature: As an action, you invoke the name of your deity. Each beast or plant creature that can see you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is charmed by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While it is charmed by you, it is friendly to you and other creatures you designate. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. * Order: You gain proficiency in the Intimidation or Persuasion skill (your choice). When you roll, you add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus. * Tempest: You can thunderously rebuke attackers. When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to cause the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d8 lightning or thunder damage (your choice) on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. * Trickery: You can create an illusory duplicate of yourself. As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you. For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. * War: When you use the Attack action, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. **Hero of Fate** &gt;*I nixed the Divine Champion's Hero of Faith trait, as I now want to avoid the addition of spells (unless traits from a domain grant spells) thanks to a commenter. That same commenter recommended something similar to a Bard's Bardic Inspiration, which I liked because it ties more into the Divine Champion's twisting of fate to further serve their quest.* Starting at 7th level, you can channel your godly power to alter the actions of others to favor your destiny. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Divined die, a d8. Once within the next 10 minutes, either you or the creature you choose rolls the die. If your deity was good, the creature you choose chooses when to roll the die and use it. If your deity was evil, you choose when to roll the die and use it. If your deity was good, the number rolled is added to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. If your deity was evil, the number rolled is subtracted from one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. Your Divined die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level. **Power of the Lords** Starting at 10th level, as your adventures continue, your divine power grows stronger. You gain two additional uses of your Blessing of the Chosen ability. **Mystical Light** &gt;*This usage of Divine Points will be totally nixed later in favor of a different usage (any recommendations?), as as I stated earlier, I want to avoid the usage of spells with this subclass (an exception being traits from the Arcana domain).* Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 2 divine points to cast the Guiding Bolt spell as a bonus action. You can spend additional divine points to cast Guiding Bolt as a higher level spell. Each additional divine point you spend increases the spell's level by 1. The maximum number of divine points (2 plus any additional points) that you can spend on the spell equals half your Fighter level. **Domain Power** &gt;*Obviously, this is still unfinished.* Depending on the domain of the deity that chose you, you can spend 2 divine points to do one of the following: * Arcana: * Death: * Forge: *Demiurgy:* As an Action, you can harness a small piece of the godly powers of creation. You can conjure 1 melee weapon of your choice, and the chosen user is proficient with it. The weapon is magical, deals either radiant or necrotic damage (if you were chosen by a good deity, it deals radiant damage. Necrotic for evil) rather than bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, gains a +2 to attack and damage rolls, and disappears after 1 hour. * Grave: * Knowledge: * Life: * Light: * Nature: * Order: * Tempest: * Trickery: * War: **So how's this new version?** Is it any better? **Could it still use some re-writes before I advance into later levels?** **Do you have any ideas for features for this subclass?** Tell me all about your thoughts in the comments, and I'll be there!"

I'm only going to talk about one specific item, he asked if I could make an item for a necromancer wizard. So I came up with the concept of a Skeletal Staff. The staff requires attunement. Class requirement: Wizards, Sorcerers, and Warlocks. I wanted to give the staff some support and crowd control effects. You gain resistance to necrotic damage. So at 3rd level you gain the following benefit. Grasping Hands. You summon large black void of darkness upon the ground, skeletal hands erupt from the ground holding your enemies in place. As an action you can select appoint you can see within range up to 120ft, skeletal hands erupt from a 10-foot radius. Creatures of your choice within range must make a strength saving throw against your spell save DC, the creatures movement speed is reduced by half until the start of your next turn. On a successful save the creatures movement speed is reduced by 10ft until the start of your next turn. This feature can be used to number of times equal to your spell-casting modifier. You regain all expended uses at the end of a long rest. At 6th level you gain the following benefit. Sapping Strength as an action you can target a creature you can see within range up to 120ft, the creature must make a constitution saving throw against your spell save DC taking necrotic damage equal to (2D6) + your spell-casting modifier. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes no damage, and has disadvantage on attack rolls into the start of your next turn. (The necrotic damage damage increases to (3D6) at 9th level, and increases to (4D6) at 12th level.) At 9th level you gain the following benefit. Skeletal Steed As an action you can expend a spell slot a 1st level or higher to summon a loyal skeletal steed. The Skeletal Steed is friendly to you and your companions, he requires a bonus action to give it a simple commands such as to attack, or to defend a location. If it is given no command it will defend itself against hostile creatures. The creature is Undead Medium sized (unaligned) Movement speed 40 ft it's hit points are equal to your spell-casting modifier plus your current level X5. Vulnerability: Bludgeoning Damage. Condition immunity: Charmed, Frightened and Exhaustion. Damage immunity: Necrotic and Poison. Str 14 (+2) Dex 16 (+3) Con 14 (+2) Wis 5 (-3) Cha 8 (-1) Int 8 (-1) +3 Dex save Actions (requires your bonus action) Trample: melee attack, one target, reach 5ft, on hit dealing bludgeoning damage equal to (2D6) + necrotic damage equal to your spell-casting modifier. You can use this feature once per long rest. At 15th level you receive the following benefits. The movement speed of your skeletal Steed increases to 60ft. You gain immunity to necrotic damage. I'm pretty happy with this so far but this is just one example of one of the three items that he would like for me to make for him. I personally think that every attuned item should function in this manner. The longer you spend time with it the better it becomes. Let me know what you think in the comments section. What are some items that you think would be cool that could level up with you?"

27,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,PEACH: Telflammar Shadowlord archetype and Thri-kreen PC race,1,hfb196,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/hfb196/peach_telflammar_shadowlord_archetype_and/,2020-06-25 08:32:57,"One of my players has an interest in DMing for our group eventually (not any time soon as we're in the middle of a campaign) and asked what I'd be interested in playing. I'm a #foreverDM, so I've never had the opportunity to play anything in a game that lasted more than one session. I told him that the two things I've always wanted to play aren't a part of 5e and he told me to convert them, so I did. I'd like the community's feedback on my Telflammar Shadowlord rogue archetype (converted from 3.5 Unapproachable East) as well as my Thri-kreen PC race adaptation (Dark Sun campaign setting). A lot of the stuff is taken *straight* from some the respective books and books of previous editions. I'll place the homebrewery links here and also present my reasoning behind some of my decisions. [Telflammar Shadowlord](URL [Thri-kreen](URL **SHADOWLORD** 1. The spellcasting was taken from the Arcane Trickster text. Some of it was removed simply so I could fit it all on 1 page instead of 1.2 pages, but is common sense to spellcasters. 2. The spell schools are illusion and conjuration. 1. Illusion is obvious: Shadow theme. 2. Conjuration was chosen because most (all?) teleportation spells are in conjuration. Also, I remember reading somewhere that there is text (either in this edition or previous) stating that a lot of conjuration stuffs comes from the shadow plane, despite what common sense would make you think based on specific spells. 3. I made one of the cantrips chosen as control flames, similar to how the arcane trickster has a mandatory Mage Hand, so that the shadowlord would kinda be encouraged to play with the light so as to fight in darkness/dimness. 4. **Shadowsight**: I've toyed with removing the ""magical darkness"" portion of this ability, but it's not *that* big a deal when you really get into gameplay. I have a player in my game (same player I mentioned before) who wanted to get Devil Sight on their warlock. They're now level 12 and there has been 1 situation in which it would have been useful. 5. **Shadow Jump**: Copy/paste of the Shadow Monk ability of the same level. 6. **Death Attack**: Copy/paste of Assassinate, but weaken it just a little bit. 7. **Shadow Blur**: Like blur, the spell, but persistent. I was thinking of a couple ways to maybe weaken this, since it's a little powerful. 1. Could change it so that it grants the shadowlord a permanent 1/2 cover instead of disadvantage on attacks. 2. Could change it so it's blur, as the spell, but only usable once per short rest. 8. **Shadow Discorporation**: You're level 19, it's not a big deal to make a save to not die. Honestly at this level this could be a bit of a detriment as your party would have to wait a while for you to come back instead of being able to revive you immediately. &amp;#x200B; **THRI-KREEN** 1. I didn't give them Sleepless just for balance sake. Do y'all think I should add it? I think that would give the race a bit too much, but that's just my opinion. 2. Gave them speed 30 just to maintain balance. 3. **Exoskeleton &amp; Chameleon**: Figured that, with chameleon carapace, the race would need an unarmored AC, so I gave it 13 + Dex. Otherwise a thri-kreen would practically never have an AC above 14 without the aid of magic/magic items. 4. **Bite**: I think if I needed to tone the race down a bit, I'd remove the Paralyze portion and just make it Poisoned. I also made the poison one use per day, which is in line with previous editions. 5. I've been toying with the idea of allowing them to use their secondary arms to do something like grant them a second interaction or something to that effect, but I haven't fully decided on anything yet. 6. Was also thinking of adding in some sort of hot climate resilience/cold climate vulnerability."

While I am not the dm, the dm has commissioned me to help with this side project and I could use some ideas. Character include 1.)A Steampunkesk Warforged Juggernaut that is only a few years of age. He worked with the police to help in the countries largest city. He actually has the soul of an old Dragonborn that was developing mechs around the city. The Dragonborn grew old and weak and in his final days he transferred his mind into his final warforged prototype. In doing so he lost his memory. He has the group's Highest AC and is the group's leading tank. Immune to Fire and Necrotic, but has a vulnerability in shock. He has formed a stronger relationship with the Artificer as she has taken an interest in his mechanics. She has done upgrades on his body in between missions. 2.)A Tabaxi Artificer who has a close connection to a mentor in the largest city. She is obsessed with tinkering, and is the squishiest of the group. Has formed relations throughout the party. 3.)A Shadow Monk Dark Elf whose father is one of the highest ranking officials in the city. She has spent most of her life within the city. She is the mixed fighter in the group. Has formed a close relation with the rogue due to her young age (at least in elf terms). 4.)A Tiefling rogue with a dark past, but a quick and friendly personality. He cares deeply for the safety of the monk and for the group. The group has learned that the name he goes by is not his true name. Parties resident thief and shifty pc. 5.)An old firbolg Druid who own a tavern in the city. His sister runs the tavern while he is away. His character had the highest stats of the group, and his character often has little to target in the way of emotional attack. He has formed more of a relationship with the Artificer than the majority of the group. Secondary tank and healer/caster. Please feel free to present any and all ideas including those from individual nightmares to characters sharing them. I have even played with the idea of having a form of nightmare creature attack and everyone has to fight through each others nightmares while the person whose nightmare is playing out is in the most danger."

A large orc horde invoked aid from the 9 hells to conquer the world, and a terrible war broke out, with an alliance of humans, dwarves, elves and even giants standing in opposition. The dwarven king of Sundabar pleaded with the giants (as dwarven and fire giant blacksmiths are the best in the world), to help create powerful weapons to aid their cause, to which they agreed as the orce were a threat to them as well. The storm giants to design the weapons, the hill giants gather rare materials, stone giants carve runes into the ore to enhance it, fire giants to stoke the flame and cast the weapons, and cloud giants to infuse the weapons with magic. The dwarven highpriest of the forge called upon Moradin to personally bless the weapons. 12 of the strongest heroes in the land wield them and with their combined might defeated the orc horde. Afterwords, the dwarf king sealed the weapons away, fearing they might eventually be used with evil intent, but the weapons could not be destroyed. The weapons: **Violet January** +3 heavy crossbow, legendary (requires attunement, and can only be attuned to one of the 12 month series weapons at a time) A large repeating crossbow that gives off a posionous odor. Is completely violet and coated in runes. Has a mysterious chamber at the bottom that seems to produce its own bolts from a purple ichor, but after testing these bolts seem to dissolve after leaving the chamber for an hour. The catridge is also very receptive to poisons poured in and will utilize them in it's strikes: you can mix a poison in with the cartridge and the next bolts will be considered poisoned equal to how many doses you poured in, triggering on hit. This works for any poison, not just poisons that activate off of injury. The crossbow is rather heavy, and leaves behind some sort of thin purple grease when touched anywhere but the handle and draw string, frequently staining clothes. Has 5 white crystals inserted in the flight groove in a row at the top that indicate how many charges this weapon has, which glow purple for each charge. Stores up to 5 charges. Regains a charge after a long rest or after you poison an enemy. Grants the following benefits; has infinite ammo and its own bullets, ignores the loading property, and grants a single casting of the protection from poison spell once per day. +3 heavy crossbow that does an extra 1d4 poison damage on hit as well. On a critical hit with this weapon, the target must make a con save dc 19 or be poisoned for a minute, which they may repeat at the start of their turns. 1 charge - Sedating poison: As a bonus action, imbue a bolt with sedating poison. On the next attack you make with the crossbow, on hit the target must make a dc 20 con save or be poisoned for the next minute. Creatures poisoned this way are unconscious for the next minute unless someone uses their action to wake them or they take damage. This also grants a charge if it poisons them. 3 charges - Spreading poison: As a bonus action, imbue a bolt with spreading poison. Next attack you make with the crossbow: on hit, the target must make a dc 20 con save or be poisoned for 1 minute, and while poisoned this way, take 3d8 poison damage at the start of their turns and exude a 30ft radius cloud of purple poison vapors for the next minute. Any creature in the radius on the start of its turn must also make a dc 20 con or become afflicted with the same spreading poison for the next minute. They can repeat the save at the start of their turn. Grant a charge per creature poisoned this way as well, making it a strong option for gaining charges against a group of enemies. 5 charges - Showstopping poison: You imbue a bolt with the deadliest poison possible as a bonus action. Next attack roll, on hit, deals normal damage but also inflicts a serious poison. On hit, target must make a dc 22 con save; ignores resistance to poison and treats immunity to poison as resistance for this attack. On fail, takes Xd12 + 20 poison damage or half on a successful save, where X is your level, in addition to normal damage. **White February** +3 Longbow, legendary (requires attunement. Can only attune to one of the 12 month series weapons at a time) An icy to touch longbow appearing to be made from some sort of frosted glass, but is still suprisingly sturdy and hard as diamond and has a pattern engraved of the spine of the world. The string glows faintly sky blue. This bow holds up to 5 charges. You regain a charge when you finish a long rest or when you reduce a hostile creatures speed from a spell or effect. +3 to attack and damage rolls, and deals 1d6 cold damage in additon to normal longbow damage. Grants resistance to cold damage and use of the fog cloud spell at will. Finally, you cannot be disarmed unwillingly, as the bow painlessly freezes to your hand. 1 charge - Freezing shot: when you shoot an enemy with this bow, you can expend a charge when making an attack. If it hits, force them to make a dc 20 con save; on fail, their speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn as they are frozen in place and grants a charge. Can only be used once per turn. 3 charges - Frostbite arrow: When you take the attack action against a foe that has their speed reduced or you have advantage on the attack, you can expend 3 charges and deal an extra xd8 cold damage to the target on the first hit, where x is half your level, rounded down. They can make a dc 20 con save to take half of the cold damage on a success. Can only be used once per turn. 5 charges - Banshee's mark: You unleash a stronger version of hunters mark as a bonus action, reducing their body temperature drastically, and a frozen spectral bansee appears to be grasping them from behind. Only one target can be marked this way at a time. A target that you can see within 120ft of you is marked this way, and gives the following effects for the next minute: -Their movement speed is reduced by half -They lose any immunity or resistance to cold damage -They gain vulnerability to cold damage -You have advantage on all attack rolls against the target -The target has disadvantage on constitution saves and temporarily loses proficiency in con saves if they had it -You know the targets exact location -If the target teleports and shifts to a different plane, you may shift with them as a reaction and appear in an open space within 120ft of your choice from the target **Pink march** +3 twin scimitars, requires attunement (can only attune to one of the 12 month series weapons at a time) a pair of lithe eastern scimitars that are a brilliant pink; the color of cherry blossoms with handguards shaped like flower petals and covered in runes. The blades themselves are very thin to allow for rapid fast strikes but are still incredibly sharp. Must be dual wielded to function properly. Enables casting of plant growth at will, and the plants grown produce pink flowers no matter what plant they are. Also enables speak with plants at will, but the plants must be flowers. Stores up to 5 charges. Gains a charge at the end of a long rest or after reducing a foe to 0. Gives +3 on both scimitars. 1 charge - Floral step: As a bonus action, you teleport up to 60ft in a spot you can see, and regain hitpoints equal to your level. You leave puff of pink flower petals where you were. 3 charges - Floral storm: perform a flurry of attacks. As an action, attack 8 times with disadvantage. The attacks must be against a single target. 5 charges - Floral transformation: Transform yourself into a guardian of flowers for the next minute as an action, ending early if you fall unconscious. A crown of flower petals float around your head, that produce an aura of pollen that extends 5ft from you, and a trail of pink flowers sprout from your footsteps. You gain the following effects for the next minute: -You gain temporary hitpoints equal to your level at the start of your turn -Your walking speed doubles -You gain immunity to charm and fear -Any creature that starts it's turn within 5ft of you has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of their turn, as they can't stop sneezing -You deal an extra 5 slashing damage on your attacks with this weapon, as sharp flower petals knick at the target with your strikes -You gain vulnerability to necrotic damage This transformation puts a good deal of stress on the weapon so it can't transform again until the next dawn. **Green april** +3 Greatsword, legedary requires attunement (can only attune to one of the 12 month series weapons at a time) A large sword in the form of a helix; two blades run and form a helix, a dark verdant green and light green blade with a brown leather hilt. It appears to blow faintly in the wind, but picks up faintly when you see a friend get hurt that grows more intense as you gain charges. As an action, you can use this blade to cast the druidcraft cantrip.

31,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,"[OC] [New Magic type] Okay so I have no idea if this format will work, but I had no idea how to share this draft any other way, so basically I'm making new magic type with spells and all so If you could GIVE ME SMALL FEEDBACK I will be SO DAM HAPPY &lt;3",2,gh8myq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/gh8myq/oc_new_magic_type_okay_so_i_have_no_idea_if_this/,2020-05-11 06:14:57,"Negative Magic \*Draft\* (Based idea - Mister Negative, Marvel) Overall description: Negative magic is one of the Forgotten Magics in this world alongside Onomancy and Dunemancy. Not much is known about this type of magic, but what is known tells us about its power to manipulate feelings, substance and form. Some old documents also speak about its negative effect on the user itself as well as others, thus the name Negative Magic comes. Some scripts also mention this magic with name Infitimancy, which roughly means magic of reversing, magic of opposition, magic of negativity. Changing base of magic to its opposite form. Negative in Latin - negativus, infitialis, abdicativus Possible attributes - rejection, reforming, brief alteration, feeling manipulation, turning into opposite. Other forms of magic - Abjuration, Transmutation, Evocation, Enchantement, Illusion, Divination, Conjuration, Necromancy, Onomancy, Dunemancy. \-Mancy, -Ation, -Ement. Possible Names - Infiti-mancy, Infiti-ation, Infit-ement Name choice - Infitimancy (magic), Infitimancer (wizard). Main spell ideas: 1. To change someone's feelings towards someone or something. 2. Change the type of a spell to its opposite. For example - Fire to Cold, or Radiant to Nectoritc 3. Change resistance or immunity to its opposite. For example - Fire immunity to fire vulnerability. Incase of resistance, when its 50% damage, it can be altered so target takes 150% Resistance - Full damage is 24, but taken 12 Altered - Full damage is 24, but taken 36. Its not full 2x (48) damage but still quite rough. Thus implementing a new word? **Submission** \- when the creature is slightly more affected to type but not fully vulnerable. 4. Changing creatures' overall mental and physical state. Targeting game mechanics and changing ability modifiers. For example - Constitution 18 (+4), changing +4 to -4. 5. Adding new type of damage alongside already existing ones - Negative Type Damage. This type of damage targets creatures feelings and emotions, while psychic damage targets mind and physical - body. Note\* - will be working on subclasses as well, probably for any class that may be good with this idea. Also every spell is still work in progress and are of Infitimancy school.

32,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,The BloodForged. A Blood Hunter class based inspired by Crona from Soul Eater,1,ghfu24,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/ghfu24/the_bloodforged_a_blood_hunter_class_based/,2020-05-11 13:24:23,"Order of the BloodForged Not many know of the dangers that can lie in the seemingly inanimate. The Bloodforged, however, give there lives to the study and retrieval of cursed objects. They have seen first hand the devastation of nearly indestructible weapons that drive their wielders to madness and mass destruction. Seeing themselves as the worlds diseased healers, member of the order of the bloodforged take the curse into themselves so that it may die with them. It is only through the excruciating process of melting these weapons to their liquid form and replacing there own blood with this cursed molten metal that they can exclude the rest of the world from this danger. It is suggested that you take a curse for your character when you take this subclass. You and your DM may work together to come up with a curse or you can choose one from the table below. Curses: 1- You constantly hear the voice of a demon telling you to slaughter every one around you. You dont know how long you can keep resisting their will. 2- You are aging at a rapid rate. You are unsure if you will be able to be of any help to those you care about before expiring. 3- Body is in constant physical pain. You have grown dependent on a concoction that numbs it 4- During the transfusion ritual the weapon almost took over your body. You had to amputate in order to keep its influence from spreading 5- Your appearance is warped and beastly. It is hard for you to look non-hostile. 6- Your race has changed to that of a mostly evil aligned race. You feel more and more like one of them every day. 7- Whenever its quiet you hear the last cries of every person who was killed with the weapon. As a result you prefer loud environments. 8- A voice is offering you information on where to find more cursed items. You just have to do a few things for it first... ***Rite of War:*** you learn the esoteric rite of war (detail below) Rite of War: your rite damage is your choice of Bludgeoning, Piercing or Slashing type. ***Blood Iron:*** Starting when you join this order at 3rd level you have undergone the procedure that makes you one with your blade. You are able to summon your rite weapon from your own blood as a bonus action by taking your crimson rite damage. This weapon can take the form of any melee weapon you are proficient with. You may choose a different form each time you summon it. When you summon your rite weapon in this way it automatically is under the effect of one of your crimson rites. This weapon loses its heavy, or thrown tags if it has one and is considered light if it is not two-handed. This weapon lasts until the end of your next short or long rest. ***Sanguine Armor***: Starting at 3rd level you are able to use the liquid metal in your veins. When you are hit with an attack or targeted by an effect that deals Bludgeoning, Piercing, Poison, Thunder, or Slashing damage you may use your reaction to harden your veins to gain resistance to the damage of that attack or spell. You may do this a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier per long rest. You may not use this ability to resist damage from your own blood hunter abilities. ***Consuming Transfusion:*** At 7th level, you are able to consume a magic weapon into your rite weapon by performing a special ritual. Over the course of 1 hour, while you hold the weapon, you perform the ritual. After this ritual is completed your rite weapon gains any magical properties the weapon you consumed had. When you consume a magic weapon in this way it takes one of your attunment slots whether or not the absorbed weapon required attunment. You may unattune a weapon as a bonus action in which the weapon is also destroyed. Additionally, when you absorb a weapon in this way you ignore all race and class requirements on use of this item. Bonuses to hit, such as with +1 weapons, do not stack with each other. You use the bonus of the weapon with the highest bonus. ***Tempered Blood:*** At 7h level your symbiosis with your weapon has become stronger. While not wearing armor your armor class becomes 14+Dexterity modifier. ***Brand of Destruction:*** Beginning at 11th level, your Brand of Castigation now directs the ire of your blood weapons curse. Any attack roll you make against the branded target is a critical hit on a roll of 18, 19 or 20 on the d20. Additionally the branded creature has vulnerability to any rite damage you deal to it. ***Morbid Puppeteer:*** At 15th level the cursed weapon in your blood has learned much about your body. If you reach 0 hit points, and are not killed outright, your blood puppeteers your body for 1 minute afterward allowing you to keep fighting. You still must make death saving throws every turn and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws or taking damage, you due not die until the end of that minute. This process is extremely draining. If you are healed in any way during this minuet you only gain half the hit points (rounded down) that you would normally receive. You cannot receive healing after you have failed all three death saving throws. ***Dark Spike:*** At 18th you learn to control your blood even outside of your body.

33,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,The Bloodforged: a Blood Hunter sub-class inspired by Crona from Soul Eater. C+C welcome,1,ghgdtn,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/ghgdtn/the_bloodforged_a_blood_hunter_subclass_inspired/,2020-05-11 14:02:44,"Order of the BloodForged Not many know of the dangers that can lie in the seemingly inanimate. The Bloodforged, however, give there lives to the study and retrieval of cursed objects. They have seen first hand the devastation of nearly indestructible weapons that drive their wielders to madness and mass destruction. Seeing themselves as the worlds diseased healers, member of the order of the bloodforged take the curse into themselves so that it may die with them. It is only through the excruciating process of melting these weapons to their liquid form and replacing there own blood with this cursed molten metal that they can exclude the rest of the world from this danger. It is suggested that you take a curse for your character when you take this subclass. You and your DM may work together to come up with a curse or you can choose one from the table below. Curses: 1- You constantly hear the voice of a demon telling you to slaughter every one around you. You dont know how long you can keep resisting their will. 2- You are aging at a rapid rate. You are unsure if you will be able to be of any help to those you care about before expiring. 3- Body is in constant physical pain. You have grown dependent on a concoction that numbs it 4- During the transfusion ritual the weapon almost took over your body. You had to amputate in order to keep its influence from spreading 5- Your appearance is warped and beastly. It is hard for you to look non-hostile. 6- Your race has changed to that of a mostly evil aligned race. You feel more and more like one of them every day. 7- Whenever its quiet you hear the last cries of every person who was killed with the weapon. As a result you prefer loud environments. 8- A voice is offering you information on where to find more cursed items. You just have to do a few things for it first... ***Rite of War:*** you learn the esoteric rite of war (detail below) Rite of War: your rite damage is your choice of Bludgeoning, Piercing or Slashing type. ***Blood Iron:*** Starting when you join this order at 3rd level you have undergone the procedure that makes you one with your blade. You are able to summon your rite weapon from your own blood as a bonus action by taking your crimson rite damage. This weapon can take the form of any melee weapon you are proficient with. You may choose a different form each time you summon it. When you summon your rite weapon in this way it automatically is under the effect of one of your crimson rites. This weapon loses its heavy, or thrown tags if it has one and is considered light if it is not two-handed. This weapon lasts until the end of your next short or long rest. ***Sanguine Armor***: Starting at 3rd level you are able to use the liquid metal in your veins. When you are hit with an attack or targeted by an effect that deals Bludgeoning, Piercing, Poison, Thunder, or Slashing damage you may use your reaction to harden your veins to gain resistance to the damage of that attack or spell. You may do this a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier per long rest. You may not use this ability to resist damage from your own blood hunter abilities. ***Consuming Transfusion:*** At 7th level, you are able to consume a magic weapon into your rite weapon by performing a special ritual. Over the course of 1 hour, while you hold the weapon, you perform the ritual. After this ritual is completed your rite weapon gains any magical properties the weapon you consumed had. When you consume a magic weapon in this way it takes one of your attunment slots whether or not the absorbed weapon required attunment. You may unattune a weapon as a bonus action in which the weapon is also destroyed. Additionally, when you absorb a weapon in this way you ignore all race and class requirements on use of this item. Bonuses to hit, such as with +1 weapons, do not stack with each other. You use the bonus of the weapon with the highest bonus. ***Tempered Blood:*** At 7h level your symbiosis with your weapon has become stronger. While not wearing armor your armor class becomes 14+Dexterity modifier. ***Brand of Destruction:*** Beginning at 11th level, your Brand of Castigation now directs the ire of your blood weapons curse. Any attack roll you make against the branded target is a critical hit on a roll of 18, 19 or 20 on the d20. Additionally the branded creature has vulnerability to any rite damage you deal to it. ***Morbid Puppeteer:*** At 15th level the cursed weapon in your blood has learned much about your body. If you reach 0 hit points, and are not killed outright, your blood puppeteers your body for 1 minute afterward allowing you to keep fighting. You still must make death saving throws every turn and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws or taking damage, you due not die until the end of that minute. This process is extremely draining. If you are healed in any way during this minuet you only gain half the hit points (rounded down) that you would normally receive. You cannot receive healing after you have failed all three death saving throws. ***Dark Spike:*** At 18th you learn to control your blood even outside of your body. Once per turn you may use one or both of your attacks to make a special attack. This attack must originate from a space where you have taken Bludgeoning, Necrotic, Piercing, Slashing, or Thunder, damage or damage from your own blood hunter abilities in the last hour and that you can see. This attack uses your Intelligence to hit, has a reach of 20ft. deals 2d10+Int modifier piercing damage and is considered magical for the sake of overcoming damage resistances. ##### Blood Curse of Retaliation *Prerequisite: 15th level, Order of the Bloodforged* As a reaction to being hit with a melee attack, you sharpen your blood and launch a counter attack Dealing 2d6 piercing damage to the creature that hit you. This damage is considered magical for the sake of overcoming damage resistances. ***Amplify:*** The targeted creature takes extra damage equal to twice the damage you take from your hemocraft die for amplifying."

35,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,New Druid Archetype - Circle of Chlorophyll,1,gjvau4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/gjvau4/new_druid_archetype_circle_of_chlorophyll/,2020-05-15 07:17:45,"Ok, so I've been thinking a lot about this, and it's quite weird that we don't have a truly plant based druid, so I've been trying to work on a Homebrew myself. I've made a lot of research, looked at a lot of other Homebrew archetypes, and I would like to ask your opinion. So, let's begin: HIDDEN IN THE WILDS Your connection to plant life has granted you unique plant based abilities. At 2nd level, you can use an action to transform into any plant that is no more than one size larger or smaller than you. When you do this, you are indistinguishable from any ordinary plant life, except by creatures with Truesight. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier. When you use this feature, you gain vulnerability to fire damage and you are treated as a plant when under the effect of spells such as Blight. However, you are resistant to all other kinds of damage. While transformed, your movement speed becomes 0, you cannot speak except through the use of the Speak with Plants spell, you are blinded and have a tremorsense of 10 feet. You cannot use any kind of actions other than transforming back to your normal self, which takes a bonus action to do. Also, whenever you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check to hide, you can transform yourself as part of your action. When you do so, you can instead make a Wisdom (Nature) check, and depending on your terrain (DM's discretion) you may receive advantage (or disadvantage) on your roll. PLANT SHAPE At 6th level, when you use you Wild Shape feature to turn yourself into a Beast, you can instead transform yourself into a Plant type creature of CR 1/2 or lower. This change applies to both your Wild Shape and Plant Shape features At level 4, the max CR becomes 1. At level 8, the max CR becomes 2, but only for plants. At level 12 the max CR becomes 3, but only for plants. At level 16, the max CR becomes 4, but only for plants. At level 20, the max CR becomes 5, but only for plants. FLORA'S STRIKES At 6th level, your attacks in plant form count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage BUSHES AMBUSHES At 6th level, your Hidden in the Wild feature becomes more flexible. If you are in your plant form and you use your bonus action to return to your original form, you can spend one of your uses of Wild Shape to transform directly from hidden form to your Plant Shape form. If you attack a creature immediately after this transformation, you have advantage on your attack. NATURA'S COMMUNION When you reach 10th level, your mind and body already demonstrate more clearly the influences of plant magic that transform them, also increasing your bond with the great net of plants. Your skin becomes a tone of green and you gain the following benefits: Photosynthesis: You don't need to eat for a day if you spend at least one hour bathing at sunlight. Green Bond: When you cast a spell with a range of touch, you can choose a plant within range of 100 feet to deliver the spell, as if it had cast. Whisper Between the Branches: You can make your voice to be heard normally between trees of the same environment. As long as you are touching one of them, you can decide to have your voice be heard on a 10 mile radius, being passed and spoken by the trees on the region, excluding urban areas, or you can choose a specific tree that you have seen, and make your voice to be heard on a 60 foot radius from that tree. You cannot hear responses using this feature. Optionally, the reverberated voice can sound as if related with the tree that transmits it. For example, older trees project hoarser voices, and healthy, adult trees project better, always with something of murmur on the leaves. SUNLIGHT POWER At 14th level, you can absorb and release the very power of the Sun itself. While you are transformed because of your Plant Shape feature, you can cast the Sunbeam and Sunburst spells once each, without the need of Vocal, Somatic nor Material components. You regain both uses after a long rest. And that's it! I hope you like it, and try giving a Feedback, please, it's really important. Also, pardon for my bad English, I'm from Brazil and not exactly the best speaker."
36,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,Final Fantasy 5/11 inspired Mystic Knight martial archetype for the fighter.,1,glnoi2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/glnoi2/final_fantasy_511_inspired_mystic_knight_martial/,2020-05-18 07:21:37,"I feel the need to preface this, but the flavour of this martial archetype to have a magical style swordsman who has elemental damage and protections and can to a minor degree can pass those protections to their allies. It's a mix of DPS and supportive tank. This comes from mainly FF11, but originally started in FF5. I have an alternative idea about how to implement the amount of sigils they can use via a storage of something like arcane points that get expended to activate their abilities. This will have to readjust the 10th level ability, but I'm open to balancing this while not losing the heart of the source. Below is what I currently have written that may need more clarification, and theres room for more possible sigils and reducing the protection sigils into a single sigil simply to make room for more. I also do know of the Rune Knight UA released not to long ago and love that subclass. This is purely a subclass to have a final fantasy flavour and style for possible campaigns in that sort of setting and beyond. Sigil Enchantment: At level 3, you gain access to a host of arcane abilities through the use of sigil enchantments. These sigils are bonded to a weapon, which you have inscribed, and take 10 minutes to enchant to the weapon for each sigil you wish to enchant. You can enchant a number of sigils equal to your proficiency modifier. You also know a number of sigils equal to your proficiency modifier + your intellegence modifier, a minimum of 1. Once you use a sigil it is expended and must be recast to use it again. Weapon Inscription: Also at 3rd level, you can take 1 hour to inscribe a melee weapon. This weapon is now bonded to you and can use your sigil enchantments. Additionally as a result of this rigorous process, you can not be disarmed of your weapon as long as you aren't incapacitated. You can only inscribe one weapon at a time. If you try and inscribe a second weapon, the first weapons inscription is broken and must be inscribed again. Mystic Protection: At level 7, you can take 1 minute to cast a sigil on a friendly creature. This sigil is linked to the sigils you have currently inscribed at this time and grants them one use of your sigils for 1 hour. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your intelligence modifier, a minimum of once. You regain all uses of this feature upon a short or long rest. Improved Sigil : At level 10, Sigils gain more uses before being expended. You gain a second use for all of your sigils and gain a third use at 17th level. Gambit Sigil: At level 15, you learn a dangerous yet worth while tactic. As an action you can release all of your currently active sigils. Doing this allows you to target a creature within 30ft and marks them with a sigil. The next time you or an ally of yours hits the target creature with an attack, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attacks damage, and then the sigil fades. Once you use this feature you must finish a short or long rest. Odyllic Sigil: At level 18, you have mastered your sigil enchantments and can utilize them against your foes. As an action you can target one creature within 60 ft, this target is marked by a sigil for 1 minute. While marked they have disadvantage on spell attack rolls, and creatures have advantage on saving throws from their spells. Once you use this feature you can not use it against until you finish a long rest Possible addition: at the end of each of the targets turns they can make a saving throw to resist the effects of the Odyllic Sigil. The save DC is 8 + your proficiency modifier + your intellegence modifier. Mystic Sigils: Elemental Sigil: Fire, Cold, Lightning, Poison: When you select this sigil you must choose one damage type: fire, cold, lightning, or poison. You can then apply that sigil to your inscribed weapon. As a bonus action you may activate the sigil and add the damage type to your weapon, dealing 1d4 of the associated type to all of your attacks for 1 minutes. This damage will increase to 1d6 at 10th level and 1d8 at 17th. You must choose this sigil again as one of your known sigils to select a different element. Enhanced Elemental Sigil: Acid, Thunder, Radiant, Necrotic: Prerequisites: Level 10 When you select this sigil you must choose one damage type: Acid, Thunder, Radiant, or Necrotic. You can then apply that sigil to your inscribed weapon. As a bonus action you may activate the sigil and add the damage type to your weapon, dealing 1d6 of the associated type to all of your attacks for 1 minutes, and the sigil fades. This damage will increase to 1d8 at 17th level. You must choose this sigil again as one of your known sigils to select a different element. Parry (S), Brace (B), Guard (P) Protection Sigil: When you select this sigil you must choose one of the types: Parry for Slashing, Brace for Bludgeoning, and Guard of Piercing. As a bonus action you can activate this sigil to gain resistance to the associated type for 1 minute, and the sigil fades. You must choose this sigil again as one of your known sigils to gain the benefits of a different protection. Warding Sigil: Prerequisites: An active Elemental or Enhanced Elemental sigil While you have an active Elemental or Enhanced Elemental sigil, you can activate this sigil to gain its benefits. As a bonus action you can activate this sigil and for 1 minute you gain resistance to the associated elemental damage type. Once the effect ends the sigil fades. Extend Sigil: Prerequisites: level 10 This sigil gives you a new combat action. You can activate this sigil as a bonus action, and lasts for 1 minute. As an action you may now make a single ranged spell attack using your inscribed weapon. This spell attack has a range of 30ft and uses you intelligence modifier for your spell attack bonus. This attack does your weapons regular damage while also dealing 2d6 force damage. Shielding Sigil: When you select this sigil you gain the ability to protect yourself magically. As a reaction you can activate this sigil to cast the shield spell. Once you do the sigil fades."

The DM puts out a world building task to earn inspiration for that week's game. This week's challenge was to come up with a magic item that makes sense in the setting. One of my suggestions was the following: &amp;#x200B; Unpierceable Shirt AC: 14 + DEX Stealth: No Disadvantage Attunement: Yes, by a creature with medium armor proficiency Special Ability: Resistant to slashing and piercing damage that doesn't exceed 20 to hit. Vulnerable to bludgeoning damage. &amp;#x200B; The DM rated it as overpowered, and I see where he is coming from. I was hoping some of you guys could help scale it back and give what you come up with a rarity rating. I really like the idea of reducing damage instead of upping AC, because the energy still dissipates into your body. Real bullet proof vests are likely to leave you with broken ribs. The upper to hit boundary to the resistance is meant to represent a hit good enough to pierce the shirt. On the other hand, tightly woven enchanted fabric isn't going to do much good if you get hit by a big stick. Hence the vulnerability."

(Innate Spellcasting) You know the cantrip [Thaumaturgy] and cast it at will. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the spell [Bane] as a 1st-level spell. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast [Wall of Sand]. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again untill you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcaster ability for these spells.

40,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,Flame-Blessed (template),1,fz49fx,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/fz49fx/flameblessed_template/,2020-04-11 22:33:47,"The following ""template"" is a modification applied to the rare few that survive Ash-Lung, a homebrew magical disease based off elemental fire. The disease involves other homebrew elements, but I wanted to share the template that gets applied to those that survive it. Some context: Ash-Lung is a magical disease that pumps volatile elemental fire magic into a person's body, enhancing fire-based powers and magic while applying several debuffs. If a person reaches the last stage of the disease, they burst into flame and transform into a violent fire elemental. On a d20 roll of 20 though, they keep their sentience and become ""Flame-Blessed"". While this doesn't necessarily need to be balanced like a race or class, I'm interested in any feedback. # Flame-Blessed &gt;You have survived being infused with elemental flame, and have taken on a new fiery form. You gain the following traits: * **Fire Immunity.** * **Cold Vulnerability.** You can not benefit from any effect that grants resistance or immunity to cold. * **Wreathed in Flame.** You are perpetually covered in flames. Anything that you touch or that touches you takes 1d8 fire damage. Your flames bright light out to 5 feet, and dim light for an additional 5 feet. * **Inferno Dice.** You have a pool of d8s, called Inferno Dice. The number of dice in the pool equals your Constitution score, and can be used in a few ways. The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals your Constitution modifier (minimum of one die). You may only expend Inferno Dice once per turn. * As a bonus action, you can cause the flames that envelop your body to burst outwards. Each creature within 5 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes damage equal to the Inferno Dice expended, and half as much on a successful save. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. The DC for this ability equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. * Whenever you deal fire damage with a spell or ability, you can expend Inferno Dice to deal extra fire damage against one of its targets. * As a reaction when you take cold damage, you can expend Inferno Dice to reduce the damage taken by the amount rolled on the dice. This reduction occurs before applying your vulnerability to cold."
41,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,Alternate Damage Type Rules,0,g3a1o1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/g3a1o1/alternate_damage_type_rules/,2020-04-18 06:40:37,"So there are thirteen different types of damage, but they all basically do the same thing. They seem to be there for a bit of flavour plus resistances, immunities, and vulnerabilities. I've created a homebrew rule for the damage types to give them each unique abilities. I have yet to playtest them, so I appreciate feedback on balance, or if something like this has been done elsewhere. Here goes. Acid: Target takes damage as usual, but on the next round they take half of that damage again. On the following round they take half of that. This extra damage may be stopped by washing off. Bludgeoning: Basic damage rules apply, doubling the damage dice (but not modifiers) upon crits. Cold: Subtract 1 foot of move for every point of cold damage taken. Upon a critical hit the target is frozen to the ground and may not move during the following round, but may attack or cast spells etc. as usual. Fire: On a crit the target is ignited and takes the same amount as the initial damage on 1d6 subsequent rounds until extinguished. Lightning: On critical hit the target drops all held items and takes doubled damage dice if wearing metal armor. Necrotic: Target must make a CON save or take 1 damage every following round until blessed, had the curse removed, or falls unconscious. If a target dies from necrotic damage they will rise as a zombie in 1d6 hours. Piercing: Basic damage rules except instead of doubling damage the target's armor (natural or otherwise) loses 1d4-1 AC instead of doubling the die. The AC remains this way until mended or repaired. Poison: Target must make a CON saving roll or has the poisoned status. Psychic: AC is no longer based on armor. AC against psychic damage is 10 + INT bonus + WIS bonus. Double die damage on crit. Radiant: Turns undead when damaging undead target, and double die damage on crit if the target is of an evil alignment. Slashing: Crit causes bleeding for 1 point damage per round until healed or bandaged. Thunder: Target must make a CON save or is deafened for 1d6 rounds. On a crit, all adjacent targets take half of the target's damage as well. Resistance or immunity to damage provides full immunity to after-effects, but otherwise basic rules stand. Vulnerability to damage type means all after-effects are treated as a crit, although not so for the damage itself, which is doubled as usual. Let me know if this appears far too unbalanced to use fairly, or if you try it out, let me know how it goes. I'm thinking of implementing it into my game in three weeks."
42,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,Optional Rule: Fear of Fire [5e],1,g6r173,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/g6r173/optional_rule_fear_of_fire_5e/,2020-04-24 03:36:31,"Basically, this is a rule designed to give the player an easier time against certain enemies, while also giving the druid an extra thing to consider when summoning (or turning into) animals. The rule is as follows-whenever a creature of the beast type is within 5 feet of fire or hit with fire damage, they must make a DC 13 Saving Throw or be frightened of either the fire or the creature who hit them with fire for 1d4 turns. This also may apply to other monsters, especially those with a vulnerability to fire. While this may seem like a blessing to players having to deal with a pack of dire wolves or a T-Rex, it also makes the Druid have some actual weaknesses-not enough to make it unplayable (especially since having a decent Wisdom Saving Throw is practically required to play as a Druid) but enough that they will have to think a little more when encountering enemies who use fire-based attacks. What do you think-is this a reasonable rule, or does it make it too easy for the players to succeed against animals?"

The biggest way I was able to ""afford"" the OP stuff I wanted to keep was to include a vulnerability to the common physical bludgeoning damage type.

Whatever the reason you hold the powers of life and death at your fingertips. **Necrotic Magic** Your link to undeath allows you to learn necromancy spells typically associated with the wizard class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the necromancy spells of the wizard spell list or the sorcerer spell list, however your necrotic blood rejects fire, and you may not learn fire based elemental spells from the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you. **Friend to death** Starting at 1st level the touch of death is familiar and comforting to you, granting you the following benefits. Undead with intelligence or wisdom below 6 will see you as their own and not attack unless within 30ft of their summoner. You have advantage on all death saving throws (unless the reduction to 0 hit points was caused by fire or radiant damage) and resistance to necrotic damage, however you are vulnerable to radiant damage. **Fell Constitution** Starting at 6th level your necrotic inheritance has fully fused with your body. You cannot age, die of old age or be aged magically. Your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to twice your sorcerer level. Whenever you gain a sorcerer level thereafter, your hit point maximum increases by an additional 2 hit points. Regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point) when you succeed on a death saving throw. Your hit point maximum cannot be decreased. You now have immunity to necrotic damage and vulnerability to fire damage. **Draco-lich wings** Starting at 14th level you may summon skeletal bat wings from your back as a bonus action. These wings are covered with an ethereal purple glowing membrane, and grant you a flying speed of 30 feet when present. The wings last until you're incapacitated, you die, or you dismiss them as a bonus action **Command Undead** Starting at 18th level, you can use magic to bring undead under your control, even those created by other wizards. As an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again. Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free. &amp;#x200B; \*For the capstone I just used the necromancer wizard one as I felt the class had nothing to support actually having undead servants. However I feel my undead body focus in general made more sense flavor-wise for a sorcerer so I'm fine with there being little chance to actually getting to it."

For the purposes of this spell, you can see through magical and non-magical darkness. This ability to see through darkness does not apply to anything outside of this spell's activation requirements.

These three things can include: a stat/check/saving throw value, a damage resistance, immunity, or vulnerability, a condition immunity, class levels, alignment, or whether it has legendary resistances/action. Second, you may ask the DM three questions about the creatures past. The DM answers in a cryptic but honest and detailed fashion as you gaze upon on the marks left on the creature's soul by its past. Lastly, you may end the spell when you do this to show the creature the darkest recesses of your soul. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC.

This spell has no effect on creatures that lack a soul such as constructs and undead."

54,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,Tactician: A Fighter subclass,1,dtqjba,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/dtqjba/tactician_a_fighter_subclass/,2019-11-09 14:21:33,"Hi all, I was thinking about a tactician, someone on the battlefield who isn't necessarily the greatest individual warrior, but more like a battle master for party tactics. Anyway, this is still super raw still so comments are welcome or suggestions for other tactical maneuvers. Tactician These fighters are known for being natural leaders on the battlefield. People from all races and classes tend to look toward them as the leader of the group. They specialize in tactical battles and are a major boon to everyone allied with them. Ferocious warriors in their own right, they inspire others to reach their level of greatness on the battlefield. The tactician feels at home as the leader of a battle hardened group of warriors, sacrificing some of their own actions to have others gain advantages in battle. Level 3 You are a master of tactical thinking and prowess in battle. Youve learned several tactical maneuvers that can help anyone allied with you. You gain 3 tactics points, which replenish on a short rest. You gain an additional point at levels 7, 10, and 15. The cost of each maneuver is broken down into categories. You automatically learn Expert Calculation and can choose 2 more from the list below to learn. You can choose another tactic to learn at lvl 7. 1 point costs Supreme Alertness \-You may give all allies you can see advantage on their initiative rolls. Doing so disables you from taking any reactions on your first turn. One Step Ahead \-As a bonus action, you can forego any movement you have remaining and divide it among any number of allies you can see. They can use reactions to move up to the amount you give them and any opportunity attacks against them are made at disadvantage. Seize the Opening \-If a melee attack misses you and an ally is within 5 feet of you and within 5 feet of the attacker, the ally can use a reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacker. Eye for Vulnerability \- As a reaction, have an ally roll an additional d8 on their attack roll. If the attack roll + d8 is a 21 or higher, the attack is a critical hit. You may choose to do roll the d8 after the attack roll is known but the tactics points are spent once the d8 is rolled. If the attack roll + d8 is below 21, treat the attack as normal. Add all other modifiers and the d8 to the attack roll for the final attack number. 2 point costs Vengeance is Yours \-As a reaction, you are able to give an ally that can see and hear you temporary hit points equal to half the damage you just took from a single weapon attack. Deft Defense \-As a reaction, you and all allies you can see gain advantage on the saving throw against an AoE attack. Additionally, if any damage is still taken from a successful save, you may choose one ally and negate the damage done to them. 3 Points Expert Calculation \-As an action, you can give all allies you can see tactical orders for their next attack. Each ally who can see and hear you has advantage on their next attack and rolls an additional damage die. Level 7: Innate tactics Choose one tactic to learn that you may use at will. \-If you are within 5 feet of an ally when they make a short or long jump, their jump distance is doubled. \-If an ally lands a critical hit and you are within 5 feet, you can attempt to grapple the target as a reaction. \-Every ally you can see who acts in combat before the first enemy does gains an additional 5 feet of movement. Lvl 10: Master Schemer You may rearrange the initiative order of your party any way you wish. Roll initiative normally. Take the highest roll of the party and assign it to whoever you wish. Take the 2nd highest and assign it next, repeat until all the rolls are assigned. Anyone reassigned cannot take reactions their first turn. Lvl 15: Horde Critical For every ally that is within 5 feet of a creature you are attacking, the threshold for a critical attack is lowered by one for all allies against that creature. For example, if you and an ally are within 5 feet of an enemy, a 19-20 on the attack roll from either of you would be a critical hit. If you and 2 allies are within 5 feet of an enemy, all three of you would have critical hits on 18-20. Lvl 18 Inspiring Leader If you attack first in combat, each ally you can see does an additional 1d6 damage on their attacks for 1 minute."

I am not locked in to any of these in their current form so feel free to let me know your thoughts! There are three spells attached, here's what the goal of each spell is trying to achieve. 1) Huracan's Gauging Spear - The goal of this is to be a high risk high reward FU, single target spell with a small amount of additional AoE. Its max damage is the same as other spells, but slightly more damage with a small amount of AoE 2) Huracan's Idyllic Garden - This was meant to be an in between of Magnificent Mansion and Liamund's Tiny hut. I wanted it to last half as long, but provide small buffs after using it. 3) Rooted - The objective of this spell was to create a type of tanking spell, similar to Tensir's Transformation I guess. It gives you temp HP and increases your Ac at the expense of your movement speed and a vulnerability. URL"

57,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,Homebrewed Race: Sasquatch,5,dhcfox,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/dhcfox/homebrewed_race_sasquatch/,2019-10-14 03:01:51,"I've been trying to develop Sasquatch into a playable race for a while, and have found it challenging to give the race the defining characteristics I have envisioned without sacrificing balance. I think I'm pretty close with this latest revision and would love some feedback. I realize I'm right on the border of OP with this design, but have hopefully included enough down side mechanics (such as vulnerability to fire and taking away metal armor) to bring it back ""down to earth."" Thank you for your time and consideration. ""The hairy people had flint tools like those of the red men, and in their caves they slept on beds of leaves and skin. For some reason they decreased in numbers until they finally disappeared entirely, and today the red men cannot tell what happened to them."" - ""Great Medicine Makes a Beautiful Country,"" Cheyenne ***Mysterious Recluse***: The squatch value quiet, stillness, and solitude above almost all else feeling these things necessary for immersion and communion with Nature, their God, if you will. They are puzzled by the way other races tend to mass upon themselves and spread, never satisfied with ""here,"" always starving for another ""there."" The constant spread of the more civilized races, as a consequence of this fundamental uniqueness vanquished most of the truly wild places, and with the wild have gone the sasquatch. The hairy folk make survival seem easy, living comfortably on the bounty of Nature's diverse providence. They are also uniquely focused and purposeful in their endeavors. Anything worth doing is worth doing perfectly. As the squatch are so inseparable from the wild and the wild is synonymous with Fey, the squatch inadvertently serve as unintentional liasons between the Fey and Material planes. As such, they are often revered or at least respected by the Fey and by nature-loving beings of the material plane alike, avoided without specific reason to interact with them. ***Towering and Tender*****:** Between 7 and 9 feet tall, their size and stature are imposing to most other humanoids, but they are fundamentally shy and tender when left alone. Their daunting physique and primal character are intimidating and misunderstood by most civilized races, but careful to observe and almost worship Balance in every action, they are often harsh with words and but tender and gentle in action. That said, threats to Nature and Balance motivate the hairy people to selfless mediation, and a motivated squatch is a terrible force for reckoning. Unassuming and humble, they live by a code of Nature, ""In service to All, servant to none."" They are covered in long hair that ranges every shade of gold, silver, copper, auburn, red, brown, and black. Their hair protects them from weather and provides natural armor against more deliberate inflictions. ***Time Is Just a Suggestion*****:** The general growth processes of a sasquatch follow that of a human until maturity which the hairy folk reach around age 15 at which time they learn through their dreams how to meditate in such a way as to resemble hibernation, almost completely severing mind from body. This transient state with elements of astral projection can be called upon at will and can have strange preserving and ""age-reversing effects"" preserving effects on the body, which makes time and age get a little fuzzy. As a result, Sasquatch live until they don't want to any more. Many choose to resend their consciousness after roughly 30yrs, while others have roamed for thousands. The life span decision of the hairy folk is more often determined by the individual's life goals and how goes the health of the land they steward. ***Wild Requiring Wilderness*****:** Bigfoot reserves no love for society life. Human expansionism has reinforced her natural love for Nature, solitude, and quiet. She avoids the business and busyness of civilizations and crowds. She struggles to comprehend why women live as they do, packed and swarming together not unlike the much smaller creatures such as mosquitoes and vermin, fortifying themselves away from the interesting and beautiful in favor of species conformity. Bigfoot values cooperation over control in every instance. ***Sasquatch Traits:*** ***ASI (Ability Score Increase)****.* Wis+2, Dex+1, and Str cannot be lower than 12. ***Age***. Sasquatch reach physical maturity around age 15 when their dreams teach them to meditate. ***Alignment***. Living almost exclusively in the wilderness, the hairy folk value balance primarily, so they lean heavily toward Neutrality, and tend to take a stand of opposition toward the pervading alignment of their immediate environments such as Chaotic Neutral in more tamed areas or Lawful Neutral in the presence of more violent climates. ***Size***. 6-8' tall, 200-350lbs (Medium) ***Speed***. 30' ***Darkvision***. Accustomed to the outdoors, caves, and rainforest canopies, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60' of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness, as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. **Wild Senses**. With excellent night vision and an extraordinary sense of smell, you have proficiency in the Perception skill and advantage against ability checks which might involve sight or smell while in a natural environment. However, the almost violent barrage of sensory information surrounding urban environs overwhelms and confuses you causing you to be at a disadvantage on perception. **Unarmored Defense**. While you are not wearing any armor, your AC=10+DexMod+ConMod. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit. However your long body hair makes you susceptible to fire (vulnerable to fire) and unable to benefit metal armors. **Wild Home**. You have expertise in Nature and proficiency with stealth and survival. **Mask of the Wild**. You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena. **Primal Growl**. Once per long rest, you can threaten a creature with a deep, booming, guttural, toothy growl (+2 intimidation). **Tool Proficiency**. Choose one natural tool proficiency from leatherworker, weaver, or potter. **Natural Weapon Proficiency**. You have proficiency with natural weapons (club, greatclub, quarterstaff, spear, dart, short bow, long bow, sling, whip, blowgun, and net. **Languages**. You can speak, read, and write simple broken Common, are extraordinarily good at relaying information with hand and body language, have natural Beast Speak which allows for limited emotional communication with animals through grunts, growls, whistles, and purrs."

However, my friend doesn't seem to think so. Thus, I'm having doubts that i'm hoping you guys can help me with. I made it so that as you kind of level up, you become a stronger vampire, and modeled after the vampire that we see in the Monster Manual. Please feel free to give me any advice. &amp;#x200B; **Level 1:** **A vampire can be any race however it replaces the subrace of your character.** **Remember it is a curse.** **Plus:** **You gain +1 Strength, and +1 Constitution.** **Thirst:** As you are a vampire, you hunger for blood and so you must quench your thirst with you drinking a whole 15 turns of blood every 2d4 days. If you do not quench your thirst in this time, you must make a wisdom saving throw (Dc 17) or bite the immediate person closest to you and suck up the amount of blood needed, every 12 hours. If you do make the saving throw, you take a point of exhaustion for every 12 hours. **Quenched healing:** When your thirst is quenched whenever you heal 1 hit point for every turn. However, if hit with radiant, fire or acid damage, the healing process ceases. **Darkvision:** Your character can now see in the dark with an impressive 120 feet Darkvision. **Necrotic resistance:** Resistance to necrotic damage **Immunities:** As a vampire, you are immune to Disease that would affect the living. **Spider Climb:** You gain the ability to climb any surface at any angle with little to no difficulty. **Natural Armor:** Your natural armor is 16. **Drawback:** **Sun is thy enemy:** With becoming a vampire also comes a huge danger, as the sun is the mortal enemy of those that creep through the night. When walking in broad daylight without taking precautions, you will take 1d6 damage every turn. However, this can be alleviated to maybe 1 point of damage every turn if you cover yourself appropriately or find shade. **Sunlight sensitivity:** As you get used to the dark your eyes are now more sensitive to the light. When making skill checks that require you to see in broad daylight you must roll with disadvantage. **Holy damage:** Vulnerability to radiant damage. **Undead healing 101:** As a vampire you are cursed with undeath, so healing potions and healing spells does not affect the undead tissue of your body, rendering them useless. **Level 4:** **Plus:** **Dread bite:** **-** As an action, you can choose to take a bite out of your enemy and suck their blood, quenching your thirst momentarily and healing yourself for **(Level 4: 1d4 + Constitution modifier, Level 8: 2d4 + Constitution modifier, Level 12: 3d4 + Constitution modifier, Level 16: 4d4 + Constitution modifier, Level 20 : 5d4 + Constitution modifier)**. **-** You then heal an additional **1d4 (for Level 4: 1 turn, Level 8: 2 turns, Level 12: 3 turns, Level 16: 4 turns, Level 20: 5 turns)** can be used only four times per long rest. **-** It deals **1d6 piercing damage + (Level 4: 1d4 necrotic damage, Level 8: 2d4 necrotic damage, Level 12: 3d4 necrotic damage, Level 16: 4d4 necrotic damage, Level 20: 5d4 necrotic damage.)** \- If you then kill the target with Dread bite, you can then add another **2d4 + Constitution modifier** to your healing. \- The target must also make a **Wisdom saving throw vs (DC 8 + proficiency + Strength or Charisma modifier, depending on what you use for intimidation)** or be **Frightened** of you. **Drawback:** **Fighting Undead beings 101:** Spells that target undead now work on you. **Level 8:** **Plus:** **Charm:** You can target one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. Target must succeed on a **(DC 8 + proficiency + Charisma modifier) Wisdom saving throw** or be **charmed** for **2d4 hours**. The charmed target regards you as a trusted friend that needs to be protected. Any time any damage is done to the target they can redo the saving throw. If you are destroyed, killed or on a different plane, the target is no longer charmed. You can use this ability once per long rest. **Drawbacks:** **Growing Hunger:** It now takes double the amount of blood for you to be quenched **(30 turns of sucking blood)** and the days to quench your thirst turn to **1d6 days**. **Sunlight hypersensitivity:** You now also take **2d6 fire damage per turn** by sunlight or by spells that recreate the effect such as Daylight, **can be reduced to 2 hit points** if you took precautions to cover yourself. **Level 12:** **Plus:** **Shape changer:** If you are not in direct sunlight or running water, you can take your **action** to **turn into a small bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.** In **bat form**, you cant speak; **walking speed is 5 feet and flying speed is 30 feet**. In mist form, you cant take any actions, speak or manipulate objects. You have advantage on Strength, Dexterity and Constitution saving throws and immune to nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from the sun. **Drawbacks:** **Running water:** While in running water, you take **2d6 Acid damage** for every turn you end in it. **Forbiddance:** You cannot enter a place until you are **offered an invitation** by one of the occupants. **Level 16:** **Plus:** **Misty escape:** When you **drop to 0 hit points**, you immediately revert into you **medium Cloud of mist form**. In this form you have **5d4 hitpoints**. If you **die in this form, your character is dead.** However, if you **survive for more than 1d4 hours** you can start to **regrow your limbs until your whole body is regrown (takes 1 hour),** starting with 1 hitpoint. **Drawbacks:** **Sunlight death lazers:** You now take **4d6 damage every turn** if you are in direct sunlight or in a direct contact with a spell that recreates it, **can be reduced to 4 damage every turn** if you had taken the proper precautions to cover yourself. **Holy light falls upon you:** If **any weapon blessed in any holy way hits you**, you must **make a DC 18 Wisdom check or be stunned**. **Level 20:** **Plus:** **Children of the night:** (Only once per day) You can now **call 2d4 swarms of bats or rats**, if the sun isnt up yet or **1d8 pack of wolves if outdoors**. They **arrive in 1d4 rounds** and can be **dismissed with a bonus action or can remain for an hour**. You can **create a vampire spawn** with a being you have recently bitten. Once created **they are under the Charm spell** unless forced or commanded to do something that would harm themselves or something they cared for. If so, they then must make your charm saving throw. **Drawbacks:** **Maddening Hunger:** Your thirst is almost never quenched, every **1d4 days** now you must feast on **50 turns of blood**. If you do not you must make a **wisdom saving throw of Dc 20** or go on a blood sucking frenzy and attack the immediate people closest to you. **Sunlight murder beam:** Being in direct sunlight or in contact with a spell that recreates the effect, results in taking **6d6 damage per turn**, **can be reduced to 6 damage per turn** if you took the proper introductions to cover yourself."

Please feel free to give me any advice. &amp;#x200B; L**evel 1:** **A vampire can be any race however it replaces the subrace of your character.** **Remember it is a curse.** **Plus:** **You gain +1 Strength, and +1 Constitution.** **Thirst:** As you are a vampire, you hunger for blood and so you must quench your thirst with you drinking a whole 15 turns of blood every 2d4 days. If you do not quench your thirst in this time, you must make a wisdom saving throw (Dc 17) or bite the immediate person closest to you and suck up the amount of blood needed, every 12 hours. If you do make the saving throw, you take a point of exhaustion for every 12 hours. **Quenched healing:** When your thirst is quenched whenever you heal 1 hit point for every turn. However, if hit with radiant, fire or acid damage, the healing process ceases. **Darkvision:** Your character can now see in the dark with an impressive 120 feet Darkvision. **Necrotic resistance:** Resistance to necrotic damage **Immunities:** As a vampire, you are immune to Disease that would affect the living. **Spider Climb:** You gain the ability to climb any surface at any angle with little to no difficulty. **Natural Armor:** Your natural armor is 16. **Drawback:** **Sun is thy enemy:** With becoming a vampire also comes a huge danger, as the sun is the mortal enemy of those that creep through the night. When walking in broad daylight without taking precautions, you will take 1d6 damage every turn. However, this can be alleviated to maybe 1 point of damage every turn if you cover yourself appropriately or find shade. **Sunlight sensitivity:** As you get used to the dark your eyes are now more sensitive to the light. When making skill checks that require you to see in broad daylight you must roll with disadvantage. **Holy damage:** Vulnerability to radiant damage. **Undead healing 101:** As a vampire you are cursed with undeath, so healing potions and healing spells does not affect the undead tissue of your body, rendering them useless. **Level 4:** **Plus:** **Dread bite:** **-** As an action, you can choose to take a bite out of your enemy and suck their blood, quenching your thirst momentarily and healing yourself for **(Level 4: 1d4 + Constitution modifier, Level 8: 2d4 + Constitution modifier, Level 12: 3d4 + Constitution modifier, Level 16: 4d4 + Constitution modifier, Level 20 : 5d4 + Constitution modifier)**. **-** You then heal an additional **1d4 (for Level 4: 1 turn, Level 8: 2 turns, Level 12: 3 turns, Level 16: 4 turns, Level 20: 5 turns)** can be used only four times per long rest. **-** It deals **1d6 piercing damage + (Level 4: 1d4 necrotic damage, Level 8: 2d4 necrotic damage, Level 12: 3d4 necrotic damage, Level 16: 4d4 necrotic damage, Level 20: 5d4 necrotic damage.)** \- If you then kill the target with Dread bite, you can then add another **2d4 + Constitution modifier** to your healing. \- The target must also make a **Wisdom saving throw vs (DC 8 + proficiency + Strength or Charisma modifier, depending on what you use for intimidation)** or be **Frightened** of you. **Drawback:** **Fighting Undead beings 101:** Spells that target undead now work on you. **Level 8:** **Plus:** **Charm:** You can target one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. Target must succeed on a **(DC 8 + proficiency + Charisma modifier) Wisdom saving throw** or be **charmed** for **2d4 hours**. The charmed target regards you as a trusted friend that needs to be protected. Any time any damage is done to the target they can redo the saving throw. If you are destroyed, killed or on a different plane, the target is no longer charmed. You can use this ability once per long rest. **Drawbacks:** **Growing Hunger:** It now takes double the amount of blood for you to be quenched **(30 turns of sucking blood)** and the days to quench your thirst turn to **1d6 days**. **Sunlight hypersensitivity:** You now also take **2d6 fire damage per turn** by sunlight or by spells that recreate the effect such as Daylight, **can be reduced to 2 hit points** if you took precautions to cover yourself. **Level 12:** **Plus:** **Shape changer:** If you are not in direct sunlight or running water, you can take your **action** to **turn into a small bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.** In **bat form**, you cant speak; **walking speed is 5 feet and flying speed is 30 feet**. In mist form, you cant take any actions, speak or manipulate objects. You have advantage on Strength, Dexterity and Constitution saving throws and immune to nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from the sun. **Drawbacks:** **Running water:** While in running water, you take **2d6 Acid damage** for every turn you end in it. **Forbiddance:** You cannot enter a place until you are **offered an invitation** by one of the occupants. **Level 16:** **Plus:** **Misty escape:** When you **drop to 0 hit points**, you immediately revert into you **medium Cloud of mist form**. In this form you have **5d4 hitpoints**. If you **die in this form, your character is dead.** However, if you **survive for more than 1d4 hours** you can start to **regrow your limbs until your whole body is regrown (takes 1 hour),** starting with 1 hitpoint. **Drawbacks:** **Sunlight death lazers:** You now take **4d6 damage every turn** if you are in direct sunlight or in a direct contact with a spell that recreates it, **can be reduced to 4 damage every turn** if you had taken the proper precautions to cover yourself. **Holy light falls upon you:** If **any weapon blessed in any holy way hits you**, you must **make a DC 18 Wisdom check or be stunned**. **Level 20:** **Plus:** **Children of the night:** (Only once per day) You can now **call 2d4 swarms of bats or rats**, if the sun isnt up yet or **1d8 pack of wolves if outdoors**. They **arrive in 1d4 rounds** and can be **dismissed with a bonus action or can remain for an hour**. You can **create a vampire spawn** with a being you have recently bitten. Once created **they are under the Charm spell** unless forced or commanded to do something that would harm themselves or something they cared for. If so, they then must make your charm saving throw. **Drawbacks:** **Maddening Hunger:** Your thirst is almost never quenched, every **1d4 days** now you must feast on **50 turns of blood**. If you do not you must make a **wisdom saving throw of Dc 20** or go on a blood sucking frenzy and attack the immediate people closest to you. **Sunlight murder beam:** Being in direct sunlight or in contact with a spell that recreates the effect, results in taking **6d6 damage per turn**, **can be reduced to 6 damage per turn** if you took the proper introductions to cover yourself."
60,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,[5e] Rogue Interrogator subclass - feedback welcome,4,dmwb5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/dmwb5q/5e_rogue_interrogator_subclass_feedback_welcome/,2019-10-25 22:49:00,"Hi folks, I have a player joining mid-campaign as a defector from the BBEG's forces. For his class he chose Rogue, and for background he decided that his character had been a torturer in the BBEG's secret police. I didn't think any of the subclasses git 100%, so I put together this subclass for him, mostly drawing things from existing sources. As well as all the below, I tweaked ""Thieves' Cant"" so that it applies to messages that the secret police use, rather than thieves. This will be far more useful in the campaign setting I'm running. Pressure Points is basically the Monk's stunning strike, but nerfed so that he has to use his Cunning Action to activate it and so that it's only useful against humanoids. I'm unsure whether it should work against undead or goblinoids, both of which the party are going to encounter in this campaign, or whether it would then become OP. We're unlikely to reach 17th level. But 13th level is a definite possibility, and that's the ability that I think fits least well. So I'd be really open to ideas for a good 13th level ability that's got a bit more of a torture-y flavour. Please let me know what you think! Cheers &amp;#x200B; **Rogue: Interrogator Archetype** **Ear for Deceit** Starting at 3rd level, you develop a keen ear for picking out lies. Whenever you make a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine whether a creature is lying, treat a roll of 7 or lower on the d20 as an 8. **Pressure Points** Starting at 3rd level, you can temporarily debilitate opponents in melee combat. You can use your Cunning Action to identify a vulnerability in a humanoid opponents defences. If you hit that creature with a melee attack, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your Attack roll. If it fails, it is stunned until the end of your next turn. **Sinister Intent** At 9th level, you gain advantage on any Charisma (Intimidation) checks against creatures with an Intelligence of at least 8. **Unerring Eye** At 13th level, your senses are almost impossible to foil. As an action, you sense the presence of illusions, shape-changers not in their original form, and other magic designed to deceive the senses within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't blinded or deafened. You sense that an effect is attempting to trick you, but you gain no insight into what is hidden or into its true nature. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest. **Eye for Weakness** At 17th level, you learn to ruthlessly exploit a creatures incapacity. If you use Sneak Attack against a creature that is stunned, paralyzed, restrained or unconscious, the damage you deal against that creature increases by 3d6."
61,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,Looking for feedback on a few homebrew races,1,dq5ypf,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/dq5ypf/looking_for_feedback_on_a_few_homebrew_races/,2019-11-02 02:43:20," I recently made some player race versions of the Jackalwere, Chuul, Nothic, and Quaggoth from the 5e Monster Manual and was hoping to get some feedback on them, namely if they're overpowered. They're currently somewhat bare-bones in terms of flavor, but I figure I'll flesh that out once I get their mechanics settled. Anyways: **Jackalwere** Ability Score Increase: Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1. Age: Jackalweres mature at a rate similar to humans, though live a few years shorter. Alignment: Though many believe Jackalweres to be inherent malicious tricksters, and indeed some fall into this role, Jackalweres are ultimately capable of choosing their own path in life. Size: Your size is Medium. Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Adept Deceiver: You have proficiency in the Deception skill. Silver Vulnerability: You have vulnerability to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from silvered weapons. Sleep Gaze: As an action, you gaze at one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. The DC for the saving throw equals 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save, the target succumbs to a magical slumber, falling unconscious for 10 minutes or until someone uses an action to shake the target awake. A creature that successfully saves against the effect is immune to your gaze for the next 24 hours. Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren't affected by it. You can use this ability once and regain the ability to do so after a short or long rest. Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Abyssal. Shapechanger: You can use your action to polymorph into a specific Medium human or a jackal-humanoid hybrid, or back into your true form (that of a Small jackal). Your statistics, unless otherwise noted, are the same in each form. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying isn't transformed. You revert to your true form if you die. You gain the following abilities while in each form: *Hybrid:* Hybrid Form: Your base walking speed is 35 feet. You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal. Bite: Your fanged maw is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Keen Hearing and Smell: You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. *Jackal:* True Form: Your size is Small. Your base walking speed is 40 feet. Your base AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You gain no benefit from wearing armor. You can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any equipment that requires hands. You cannot perform the somatic components of spells. Bite: Your fanged maw is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Keen Hearing and Smell: You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. Pack Tactics: You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated. \--- **Chuul** Ability Score Increase: Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1. Age: Chuuls grow slowly, reaching physical maturity around the age of 40. Designed for longevity, they can live indefinitely. Alignment: Having been created by the aboleths as dutiful servants, chuuls tend towards lawful evil. However, chuuls that have broken free of their ingrained directives can forge their own path in life. Size: Chuuls stand around 6 feet at shoulder height. Their shells and six-legged anatomy make them heavy for their size, averaging 500 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 ft. Your base swim speed is 20 ft. Amphibious: You can breathe air and water. Awakened Mind: Your creature type is humanoid instead of aberration. Darkvision: You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Magic Sense: You can cast the Detect Magic spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so after you finish a short or long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it. Natural Armor: Due to your shell and six-limbed body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. However, your chitinous carapace provides ample protection; it gives you a base AC of 16 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal. Pincers: Your pincers are natural weapons designed for grasping prey. You have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks when attempting to grapple a target. Tentacles: Your tentacles secrete a natural venom. As a bonus action, you can force a creature you are grappling to make a Constitution saving throw.The DC for this saving throw is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw on the end of each of its turns. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is no longer poisoned and becomes immune to the venom for the next 24 hours. After you use your tentacles, you can't use them again until you finish a short or long rest. Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Deep Speech. \--- **Nothic** Ability Score Increase: Your Dexterity, Intelligence, and Wisdom scores increase by 1. Age: Alignment: Size: Your size is Medium. Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Vestige of Humanity: Your creature type is humanoid (nothic) instead of aberration.

You can use this ability once and regain the ability to do so after a short or long rest. Rotting Gaze: As an action, you gaze balefully at one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 necrotic damage. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus. For the next minute, the target must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns or take an additional 1d6 damage. This effect ends on a successful save. The damage increases to 2d6 at 6th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 16th level. You can use this ability once and regain the ability to do so after a short or long rest. Weird Insight: As an action, you stare at one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must contest its Charisma (Deception) check against your Wisdom (Insight) check. If you win, you magically learn one fact or secret about the target. The target automatically wins if it is immune to being charmed. You can use this ability once and regain the ability to do so after a short or long rest. Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Undercommon. \--- **Quaggoth** Ability Score Increase: Your Constitution score increases by 2. Age: Alignment: Size: Your size is Medium. Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Your base climbing speed is 30 feet. Darkvision: You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

Wounded Fury: While you have half of your hit points or fewer, you have advantage on attack rolls. In addition, while you have one quarter of your hit points or fewer, you deal an extra 1d4 damage whenever you hit a target with a melee attack. The damage increases to 2d4 at 6th level, 3d4 at 11th level, and 4d4 at 16th level. Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Undercommon.

Sunlight Sensitivity: You have disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of our attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.

62,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,Rune enchants - feedback wanted!,1,d0uf08,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/d0uf08/rune_enchants_feedback_wanted/,2019-09-07 20:30:51,"I've talked to my playgroup (who likes a good mix of RP style and also more video game style combat sessions with playmats) about changing up magic item rewards. Rather than handing them a list of magic items, or giving them one I think they'll like, I'm retrofitting ESO's rune smithing system which will allow players to mix runes to create a unique effect. There is a max of one enchantment per player, and more and more interesting runes will become available in addition to treasure as the campaign progresses. Enchantments can be on anything they carry. Put simply, there are 3 groups of runes. Verb, Noun, and Trigger. Verb could include: - Nullify - Become - Control Noun could include: - Flame - Knowledge - Time Trigger is when the effect actually starts: - On killing a creature - When in peril - When under the night sky with the moon visible Players choose a rune from each category to build a custom effect that I hope to invent on the fly that is appropriate for their level. For example Control/Time/Peril runes grant Haste to the user when their health drops to single digits. Become/Flame/Killing might set the user alight for a duration after killing a creature... I'm sure I can make that a positive with thought. The main feedback I want is about the quest rewards for completing a major subplot, enchantments that morph a chosen weapon into a more powerful version built to fend off the waves of demons and aberrations in the endgame. Instead of Verb/Noun/Trigger there is just Effect/Trigger. There are 8 runes to allow one combination per player. I know they'll enjoy trying to work out the optimal combinations even if they're quite ""game-y"". I've posted them below and I'd like feedback on their balance. First are the Trigger runes. When the condition is met the weapon will glow with power, applying the effect (seen below triggers) to the next creature struck. - Reap &gt; Upon killing a demon, devil, undead, or aberration. Then if it your turn, you may move up to 5ft, and you may attack another creature adjacent to you. - Retribution &gt; Upon taking damage from an attack from a demon, devil, undead, or aberration. You do not fail *any* death saving throws from taking damage, though you still die if your health falls below your maximum limit. - Zeal &gt; Upon dealing damage with two consecutive attacks to the same demon, devil, undead, or aberration. This can be over multiple rounds. When a demon, devil, undead, or aberration dies within 60ft of you, gain health equal to it's CR. - Intervention &gt; Upon landing an attack of opportunity on a demon, devil, undead, or aberration. When hit, the creature's movement speed becomes 0 until the end of it's next turn. Next up are the Effect runes, applying it to the next creature struck. If the creature is damaged for 1 or more hitpoints, the empowerment ends. If the attack misses the empowerment does not end (lasting 5 minutes) - Judgement &gt; Deals 2d6 additional radiant damage. &gt; On damaging a demon, devil, undead, or aberration, attacks made against it have advantage and the creature has vulnerability to all damage types. This lasts until the end of your next turn. - Parity &gt; Deals 2d6 additional radiant damage. &gt; Upon damaging a demon, devil, undead, or aberration, it takes radiant damage equal to it's CR. Then you may redistribute the health lost in this way between any number of target creatures within line of sight. - Sanctuary &gt; Deals 2d6 additional radiant damage. &gt; Upon damaging a demon, devil, undead, or aberration, the damaged creature cannot reduce the health of yourself, or an ally within 60ft of you, below 1HP on it's next turn. The creature gains disadvantage against all saving throws until the end of your next turn. - Flagellation &gt; Deals 2d6 additional radiant damage. &gt; When you damage a devil, demon, undead, or aberration it loses concentration and becomes vulnerable to radiant damage. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes damage from any sources of healing instead of regaining hit points. It can attempt to resist this effect with a Will save (10+spell level+prof.). Each player chooses one trigger and one effect. For example the fighter may choose Judgement/Reap whilst the cleric chooses Retribution/Parity. If the player doesnt use a conventional weapon (e.g. a caster) then there are a few rules about it applying from spell casts instead. Anything which deals damage as an attack should work. I want the effects to synergise but also stand on their own. The players should be around level 9 acquiring these weapons and around 11 by the final fight. I want them to be balanced, but to be special and irreplaceable as getting these is a major milestone to the story. Any feedback on the balance between them?"

64,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,Need help balancing subclass.,0,dbmhfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/dbmhfg/need_help_balancing_subclass/,2019-10-01 12:16:50,"I need help balancing a Barbarian subclass. This is inspired by Escanor from The Seven Deadly Sins. His innate power called Sunshine allows him to grow stronger as the sun rises, where he reaches his peak at noon. Afterward, he starts to grow weaker until he's back to his normal self. Please leave any suggestions you may have. # Path of the Sun Some Barbarians may choose to draw power from their chosen god, wells of internal magic, animal spirits, or their own seething fury. However, you take it a step beyond the rest. You draw energy from the sun itself to increase your reflexes and might to un. ## Sunshine The power of the sun imbues your rage, making you much taller and more muscular, with your clothes and armor being ripped off unless specifically tailored to your growth. Your height increases by 2 ft and your weight increase by 100 lb. In this state, your physical strength and endurance are incredible and immense magic power casually radiates from his body as intense heat. You seem to be able to exert some control over this, being able to prevent allies from being hurt. At third level, the following benefits are added to your rage: 1. You ignore the 2-Handed trait for weapons and every weapon you wield while in ""Sunshine"" form can be wielded in 1 hand. 2. Being imbued by the sun itself, the heat of other attacks are insignificant to you. You gain resistance to fire and radiant damage. 3. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. ## Sun Aura While empowered by the sun, you can flare your aura to light the way or harm your foes who try to attack you. You emit a 60 ft aura of bright light and 60 ft aura of dim light. Additionally, when an enemy damages you with a melee attack, they take radiant damage equal to your constitution modifier. At 10th level, your light becomes so intense that it affects creatures with vulnerability to sunlight as if it were daytime. ## Gift of the Doubled Dawn At 6th level, your body is starting to acclimate to the Suns power. You can store energy for later use under the following conditions: 1. While in direct sunlight, you charge your body with sunlight energy, you can keep this energy, choosing to spend it at will. You gain 1 Sun Charge for every 2 hours in direct sunlight. 2. You start out only able to hold 1 charge. This changes to 2 at 10th level and 3 at 14th level. At night you can choose to spend one of these charges. Giving you the ""Sunshine"" effect. This effect lasts for one minute per charge. 1. If daylight is cast within a 500 foot radius of you or the spell is present, for the duration of the spell, you gain the ""Sunshine"" effect, but you do lose all your charges after the daylight spell is gone. ## Spellcasting At 10th level, you gain access to spellcasting. These spells can only be cast while under the effect of Sunshine and are a 1-time use and can be recharged by meditating for half an hour in the sun. Your spellcasting modifier is equal to a strength based proficient weapon. You may use one of these two options as a bonus action. The cost is one sun charge. 1. Cruel Sun: Emanating from your fingertips is a miniature sun, burning with intense heat. Firing straight at a target at will. Make a ranged attack against one creature in a 100 foot range, It takes 8d8 fire damage on a hit. On a hit the target is also pushed back 20 feet. This damage increases with every specified level here. 2. Pride Flare: You cast Cruel Sun in your hand, however instead of firing the sun to an enemy, you make it explode in a 30ft cone. All targets in the cone must make a DEX save equal to 8 + Proficiency Bonus + CHA modifier. Taking 8d6 fire damage failed save, and half of that on a successful save. ## The One At 14th level, you may spend every ounce of energy within your body to call upon this form at the cost of all your rage slots. You can choose to enter this state as a free action when you first enter Rage. 1. While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier + your Strength modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit. 2.

For the duration, an affected creature or object has vulnerability to the chosen type. Additionally, attack rolls against the affected creature or object have advantage if the attacker can see it, and it cant benefit from being invisible. For the seasons, radiant = spring, fire = summer, necrotic = autumn, cold = winter."

Make duration: 1 hour in stead of duration: concentration, 1 hour. But you gain vulnerability to fire, since there are quite a lot of base enemies that deal fire damage. Would that make it too strong, too weak, or maybe there are some better ways to change it a bit."

So here's a Rogue Archetype I've been brewing up for a bit. I'm a fan of the Gish concept this one is designed to do just that: You have been seriously affected by something that has damaged the very weave of magic itself around you. Normally you are or were (or should have been) an exceptionally talented wielder of magic, regardless of it's source, but the damage to the weave around you has forced you to hone your not inconsiderable martial skills to compensate for your stunted magically abilities. By combining what remains of your magical talent and the swiftness you have trained with, you have learned to become a deadly and versatile combatant who exploits the vulnerabilites of their foes. ''Weave Shadow:'' Weave Blade: At 3rd level you recognize how the Weave interacts with specific elements. When you deal damage with your sneak attack, you may choose to deal one of the following types of damage instead of the weapon's damage: Fire, Cold, or Acid. At 7th, 13th, and 19th you may choose another type of damage from any type. ''Weave step:'' Additionally at 3rd level, you have learned a simple trick that, by manipulating the weave just so, you can launch yourself a short distance even off nothing but air. You gain a Flight speed of 5 feet. If you are still aloft at the end of this movement, you begin to fall. ''Akashic Record:'' At 9th level you followed traces of something and have learned to reach into the Weave itself to draw out a special tool. You gain access to a unique book of Ritual magic called an Akashic Record. The record normally occupies its own dimensional space, though you may summon it as an action. If it is ever out of direct contact with you for more than 1 minute or you are Unconscious the Record returns to its dimensional space. Using this Record, you may record and cast any spell with the Ritual tag, and you start with either the identify or Detect magic spell as well as 1 other spell in the Record. Your spellcasting modifier for these spells is 8 + your proficiency modifier + your intelligence modifier. Once you have cast a spell using this feature you may not do so again until a number of days pass equal to the level of the spell cast. The maximum level of spell you may cast or record is equal to 1/4 your character level (rounded up, can also use rogue level if more appropriate). ''Invert the Weave:'' At 13th level, once when an effect requires you to make a saving throw that you are proficient in and you succeed, you may impose that effect on the origin thereof as a reaction. You regain use of this feature after finishing a short or long rest. ''Alter the Weave:'' At 17th level, you may attempt to learn the immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities of a creature with 30 feet of you By making an Intelligence(Arcana) check using your Cunning Action. Additionally, when you do so you may afflict the creature with one of the following effects for 1 minute: -Reduce an immunity to a resistance. -Remove a resistance. -Impose a vulnerability. If the creature has a higher level or CR than your level they may save against this effect with a successful Constitution save. The DC for this is 8 + your proficiency modifier + your intelligence modifier. Hoping for some feedback here ideally. I think it's really thematic since the rogue class itself handles any real martial needs which leaves the Archetype free for magic things. This is also still something of a work in progress so there are probably things I missed."

DC 16 WIS save to Halve.* **Blobby Blobby Blobby:** *Legendary Action (4-6 to recharge). A single Creature it can sense within 60ft must make a DC 18 WIS save to resist the effect, If the creature fails it is feared until it can spend its full turn to calm itself down. Its speed is also reduced to 0 for one turn. Does not work on Children.* **Description:** *From the corners of the room all you hear is the deranged warbling of this creature, you turn only to see the bright large green eyes. The myths are true as this large pink and yellow creature emerges shaken all manner of men to its core, Mr Blooby is a legend to most and a nightmare to all above the age of maturity and deadly to those who no longer possess the innocence of a child.*"

I loved this idea and after using the Heart of the Wild as an one shot for them decided to have all the rings related to Ubtao's essence. All the rings were given to Champions of Mezro by Ubtao after the war of the Eshowe. After years of wear and tear the rings have lost most of their power but can be refueled by the Essence of the Ubtao's will. Aka, gems of fire, water, earth, air and All the homebrew since spells are based on one of my favorite Dota 2 Heroes Phoenix. Any feedback would be welcome, thank you! **Ring of Summer** **Fire Immunity.** While attuned to and wearing the ring, you have immunity to fire damage and don't suffer any effects from extreme heat. ****Nondetection **** The ring defies attempts to magically locate it. Neither the ring nor the fielder can be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through any sitting sensors. **Sentience.** The Ring of Summer is sentient Lawful Good item with an intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 17, and a Charisma of 14. The ring can communicates but usually uses images to tell stories. It can hear normal and see normally in a 60 feet radius. The ring purpose is to bring back Ubtao's return to Chult. Anyone who would defile the name of Ubtao or do harm to a neutral dinosaur creatures will invoke the ring's wrath. The player wielding the ring must make a Intelligence Saving Throw (DC 17) or be controlled by the ring until they can pass the save. **A Fire that may never die out.** As long as you wear the ring, you don't age naturally. This effect is similar to suspended animation. This ring does not help with magical or supernatural aging effect, such as the horrifying Visage of a ghost Magic. This ring has 4 charges and regains 1d4+1 expended charges at the beginning dawn. * All fire damage spells and attacks deal 1 extra damage. * You can expend charges to cast; (1 point) Spike Growth but fire, (2 charges) Icarus Leap, (1 point) Burning Hands and (2 points) Haste. After recovering a Ubtao's Fire Essence * All fire damage spells and attacks deal 2 extra damage * you can cast (3 points) Sunray,(3 points) Phoenix Spirits, and (4 points) Fire storm. * You can expend one charge as an action and use the ring to raise the temperature in a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on a point that you can see within 300 feet of you. The temperature raises by 20 degrees every minute, to a maximum of 120 degrees Fahrenheit. This effect is permanent unless you use the ring to end it as an action, at which point the temperature returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees every minute. After recovering Ubtao's Fire Essence * All fire damage spells and attacks deal 3 extra damage. * You can cast (4 points) Sun Burst and (4 points) Flesh to Fire. * You can also gather energy from the elemental plane of fire and become an icon of fire. You can expend the necessary number of charges as an action and use the ring to create either an inanimate fire object (2 charges) or an animated fire creature (4 charges). The fire object cant have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (your choice). The fire creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to cold damage, immunity to fire a poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. The fire creature obeys only its creators commands. The fire object or creature appears n an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme cold, it loses 5 (1d10) hit points per minute and turns to ash. * Icarus Leap 2nd level conjuration Casting time: Bonus Action Range:Self Components: V Duration: Instantaneous You travel in an 30ft arc and can stop at any of the locations in this arc. If you would pass towards an enemy that enemy must make a Dex saving throw of your spell DC or take 2d6 fire damage or half if they pass. If you also would pass through an enemy you may also use your action to attack but at disadvantage. * Sunray 3rd level evocation Casting time: Action Range: 120 ft Componetns: V,S Duration: 1 minute You expel intense flames from your ring in a 15ft wide starting at your location. If any enemies are in the area they must make a Con saving throw or take 3d8 at the end of your turn. If an ally is also in the beam they will heal for 1d8, this increases by 1d8 if the player received this effect last turn. * Phoenix Spirits: 4rd level evocation Casting time: Action Range: Self Components: V, S Duration: 1 minute Summons 3 fire spirits that circle around you. Each spirit can be launched independently at a targeted area of effect. As an bonus action, you can make a spell attack with one or more of the fire spirits to ignite your enemy aflame dealing 2d6 if don't pass an Con saving throw. While on fire the target has disadvantages on using S spells and disadvantage with attacks. * Supernova: 5th level evocation: Casting time: Action Range: Self Components: V Duration: 6 seconds You transforms into a burning sun that scorches (10ft by 10ft, 5ft in the air) enemies in a huge area. The sun can only be target of melee attacks and is immune to any magical damage. While in Supernova you can not take any reactions or any movement. If any enemy would enter or end their turn within the 10 ft radius of the Sphere they will take 3d6 fire damage on a failed Con save. At the start of your turn you crash the sun into the ground casting fireball as the sun as the center of the location. You and an ally within the 30ft radius are healed for the same damage that was dealt."

Any recommendation and constructive criticism will be very welcome. The Fortune &amp;#x200B; Randomized Expanded Spell List The Fortune lets you choose from an expanded list of spells from others warlock subclasses. Roll a d6 for the spells of level one, and add to your warlock spell list the spell that you would normally add from that patron. Repeat this for the spells of level two, three, four and five. 1 the Archfey 2 the Fiend 3 the Great Old One 4 the Undying 5 the Hexblade 6 the Celestial &amp;#x200B; Improved Hex At level 1, when you cast the spell Hex on a creature, you can force that creature to make a charisma saving throw roll against your spell save DC. If the creatures fail the saving throw, it has disadvantage in all attacks, skills and salvations rolls while. The effects end if the Hex ends. Once you use this skill you can not use it again until you finish a short or long rest. &amp;#x200B; Arcane Bet At level 1, you learn to perform a ritual that lasts for a minute in which you bet magic power against your Patron. You can spend any amount of spell slots you want and throw a d20 while your Patron throws another. If you roll a higher number than your Patron, you recover double the amount of spell slots you expended, being able to have more spell slots than the maximum allowed for your level. If you tie, you recover the same amount of spell slots expended. Additional spell slots last until your next short or long rest. If you win with the bet with a 20, you gain triple the number of spell slots instead of double. If you lose with a 1, you cannot cast spells of level 1 or higher spells until you finish your next long rest. At level 6 you learn to perform the Arcane Bet as an action and at level 11 as a bonus action. &amp;#x200B; Energy Bet At level 6 your failures become more horrible and your successes more glorious: Each time you roll a natural 20 in an attack roll you can use a bonus action to cast a cantrip or to use the attack action. Each time you roll a natural 1 in an attack roll you suffer 2d10 + 10 force damage that cannot be reduced in any way. This damage is increased to 3d10 + 15 at level 11 and 4d10 + 20 at level 17. Also, before making an attack you can apply a -5 penalty to your attack roll. If the attack hits, add 5 to the damage of the attack. &amp;#x200B; Bloody Bet At level 10 you learn to impose disadvantage to the attacks that are made against you. You can impose disadvantage on any attack rolls that are made against you when you see the attacker. If you do, you have vulnerability to all the attacks that are made against you by that attacker. &amp;#x200B; Ultimate Bet At level 14 you learn to turn your soul into a die as an action and roll it once per long rest 6: You cast the spell Wish 5: You recover all your spell slots and all your uses of Mystic Arcanum"" 4: Recover all your hit points 3: You lose all your hit points 2: You lose all your spell slots and all your uses of Mystic Arcanum"" 1: You die, your body and all your possessions turn to dust except for your souls dice. You cannot be resurrected by any means less than a wish spell. A creature that your Patron considers worthy can roll your souls dice and resurrect you with a 6 and dying with a 1. A creature that dies in this way cannot be resurrected by any means less than a wish spell."

Alternatively, instead of adding the damage and doing your normal damage you can do the d6 but not your normal damage and also make your enemies lose turns to blocking your attack. **10th lvl: lucky attack** 2 times per long rest, but not on the same round, you can burn your bonus action to give yourself an advantage on an attack roll that round. **15th lvl: relentless stabs** 2 times per long rest add 40 slashing damage to your attack. If you miss then you still lose one of those times. **18th lvl: relentless control** If you roll over a 16 with no modifiers and hit you stun the enemy for 1 turn. This does not stop the enemy from taking legendary actions. **Style of Broken hope (work in progress)**"
74,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,Help making an ability: heavy armour/weighted clothing being shed for a temporary speed boost (ala Rock Lee),2,b1awq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/b1awq7/help_making_an_ability_heavy_armourweighted/,2019-03-15 16:25:07,"So I have this idea for a very shonen-inspired fighter/paladin who wears heavy armour but fights using his fists via tavern brawler. The whole idea is that he's this high Strength bruiser who loves to fight and prove his strength. Importantly, he wears extremely heavy armour as a sort of resistance training and self-restriction so normally he's this kind of hulking tank that hits like a truck. I have a very openminded DM (and group) and we've discussed having this kind of nova, last-resort ability where he uses quick release mechanism or something to shed his armour and become incredibly fast and difficult to hit basically exactly like the classic fight between Rock Lee and Gaara in Naruto, the Darknut in Twilight Princess or when Piccolo throws off his weighted cape in DBZ. What are some ways I could make this a very high risk/high reward desperation ability? I was thinking it could skyrocket his AC and raise his to hit bonus for a limited period of time in exchange for vulnerability to all or most damage? Lower HP max? The idea being he becomes difficult to hit but if he is, it would be devastating. Alternatively, we've considered exhaustion after 1 minute. Just swapping his Str and Dex probably won't really make it the ""oh shit"" ability we envision it as nor make it risky enough for it to be something that happens rarely. I'm not interested in abusing it -- I just want it to be a dramatic last-resort of a prideful fighter that may only happen once or twice in his career. Any help or ideas to make it balanced would be appreciated!"

I'd like to hear your thoughts on them. I'll probably end up making a few posts on them. Enjoy! (be wary, I haven't given them any fluff) Dungeons &amp; Dragons custom class The Crumbling Knight Hit Points Hit dice: 1d20 CK level HP at 1st level: 20+ CON mod HP at higher levels: 1d20(or 11) + CON mod Proficiencies *Armour: heavy, shields *Weapons: simple weapons, martial weapons, only heavy crossbow for ranged *Tools: none *Saving throws: strength, constitution *Skills: Choose any two from; Athletics, History, Insight, Acrobatics, Intimidation, Survival You can choose an archetype at 3rd level. Stat leveling goes as normal e.g. a fighter Equipment *(a)A single handed martial weapon and a shield (b)A two handed martial weapon (c) two single handed martial weapons *(a) A heavy crossbow with 20 bolts (b)minor potion of healing *(a)Dungeoneers pack (b)Explorers pack *(a)Chainmail armour (b) ring mail ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Fighting Style ____________________________________________________________________________ Choose any fighting style from the fighters list Crumbling Vulnerability ____________________________________________________________________________ When at or under half health(rounded down), you take double damage, but you recover all HP after a short rest, and 1 hit die can be used as a bonus action. Sacrificial Power ____________________________________________________________________________ Beginning at 2nd level, you can sacrifice 1+your CK levels worth of HP to fuel certain abilities as a bonus action such as: 2nd level: frenzy- add 1d4 extra to damage for the next 3 turns. You gain an extra d4 at 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th levels 5th level: crumbles of harm- for the next 3 turns, upon being hit with a melee attack by a creature or undead, it takes 2d6 damage. The damage is increased by 1d6 at 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 20th levels. 11th level: particle consumption- upon activation, for the next 3 turns, gain that amount of HP healed, up to your maximum HP. 20th level: blast life- upon activation, roll 10d6. You lose HP equal to the activation cost + what you rolled, but all current enemies in a 15 ft radius take equal damage. Can be used once per short rest. ARCHETYPES! The Cursed When choosing this at 3rd level, each turn in combat you lose 1+your CK level worth of HP each turn, but upon getting a kill you gain 1+your CK level + 1d10 worth of HP healed, up to your max HP. the number of dice rolled increases by 1d10 at 8th and 15th levels. Upon 5 level in this archetype, you can give your melee weapon a heavenly curse. When using this weapon in combat, upon getting a hit you are healed 1d10 HP, but if you do not attack on your turn in combat, then you take 1d10 damage. The number of dice rolled increases by 1d10 at 11th and 20th levels. If ever your weapon is destroyed or you want to switch weapons that have this feature, you may spend 30 HP to do so. The original weapon loses this feature. Upon level 8 in this archetype, you can roll 6d6 once per short rest. What you rolled can be used to heal a another creature of choice if you are within 5 ft of you. The amount healed is exactly what you rolled, no more, no less up to that creatures maximum HP. Any HP going over the max HP threshold is lost. Upon healing, you lose the same amount of HP healing. If doing so brings your HP to 0 or below, you instantly die. After using this ability, you need to wait for the next short rest in order to use this ability again. Upon reaching level 11 in this archetype, once per short rest you can roll two sets of 6d6, and the ability in the paragraph above is changed so you can choose which set you want to use to heal, but the other set is rendered unusable. Upon level 20, you can sacrifice all but 1 of your HP (whether full or not) to do equal damage to all current enemies in a 10 ft radius. After doing so, you are rendered unconscious for the next hour, and cant be awoken by any means before the hour. When regaining consciousness, continue playing normally, with the 1 remaining HP. It can be healed normally afterwards. ____________________________________________________________________________ The Creator When choosing this archetype at level 3, you gain the ability to sacrifice HP to make make objects. With each added option of the weapons stats the cost grows. The weapon then disappears after 24 hours, but can be used by anyone before the time is up, regardless of proficiency. They have a distinct grey colour to them. Weapon type: HP cost: Knife 7 Rapier 10 Sword 15 Axe 15 Mace 15 spear/javelin 12 Bow 10 Crossbow 10 Damage HP cost (per die, up to 3) D4 7 D6 10 D8 15 D10 20 D12 25 Attribute HP cost (per attribute, up to 2) reach(excluding Knife &amp; rapier) 10 Versatile (excluding knife)10 Thrown (excluding all But knife &amp; javelin)5 Light 10 Regarding ranged weapons: ranged weapons made by this ability have a maximum range of 100 ft and cannot gain any extra attributes. Their attributes are ranged and loading. Upon level 5, you can create small objects such as rings, or other similarly sized objects. Each object of this size costs 20 HP to make. Upon level 11, you can make small creature of your esthetic choosing that you can control. It can attack on your bonus action in combat, with +5 to hit and dealing 1d4+1 damage and 5 HP, with 15 AC. Upon creation, the creature lasts 3 days before disappearing. Normal: 30 HP Swimming: 35 HP Flying: 40HP Upon level 20 in this archetype, you can sacrifice 80 health to create an identical replica of yourself with 20 HP. It can wield any weapon you give it, but if you dont itll have a grey sword that does 1d8 damage. In combat, it has +5 to hit, 15 AC and can make 1 attack on your bonus action. It cant take reactions. Outside of combat, the creation will follow simple commands, such as carry, attack, defend and run. You can support up to two of such replicas, which both act on your bonus action. "

They're called the Sha'Rax-Ti, a race of insect-like creatures that form a consciousness once enough have gathered. Due to the ease in which the swarm can get separated, they infest the bodies of other deceased humanoids as to keep their form together. (Lore is still being developed, but that's the jist.) It's mainly the traits I'd like help balancing. I've tried to use Detect Balance's ratings as a guideline, which you'll see the value next to each ability on what I believe it was rated.Overall, the race comes out to a 24, when 26.5 is considered 'average'. Key Words \&gt; Xkrith - Single drone within the collective \&gt; Host - The body the Sha'Rax-Ti is infesting &amp;#x200B; **Ability Score Increase (12).** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1. **Age.** Individual Xkrith live around three months, though through replacing lost of drones, you are effectively immortal. **Alignment.** A complex relationship with mortality and physical existence leads most Sha'rax Ti to be Chaotic, often tending towards evil alignments. **Size.** Though your swarm's total number varies considerably from day to day, you require enough drones to fill a Medium Humanoid to maintain consciousness. **Speed (-2).** The restriction of inhabiting a body reduces the speed it would normally be capable of. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. **Aberrant Nature (0).** You have two creature types: aberration and humanoid. You can be affected by any game effects that target either of these types. **Buzzing Swarm (0).** You can perform verbal components for spells through the chittering, writhing and quivering sounds of your bodies. **Cyclic Rest (4).** You rotate the time when your drones are resting, keeping many awake at all times. You do not need to sleep and can complete a long rest by performing 6 hours of light activity. **Infested Host (6).** You survive by infesting the corpse of a medium humanoid. This corpse is considered your *Host*. While the swarm can replace the drones lost from injury or time, it cannot repair the corpse it inhabits. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, your *Host* will become damaged. While your *Host* is undamaged, you are indistinguishable from an ordinary member of your *Host's* race, though your actions may give you away. While your *Host* is damaged, other creatures are more easily able to recognise you as Sha'Rax-Ti. If you have access to a medium humanoid corpse, you can choose to infest it over the course of a Short Rest and make it your new *Host*. You must complete a long rest before you can infest another corpse. **Mental Touch (6).** The collective mental prowess of your swarm allows you to reach out to the minds of others. You can speak telepathically to any creature within 30 feet of you that you can see. The creature understands you only if the two of you share a language. You can speak telepathically in this way to one creature at a time. **Psychically Unstable (-8).** The psychic connection that holds your swarm together is a fragile thing. You have vulnerability to psychic damage. **Purge the Infected. (6)** By removing weakened drones from the swarm, you can prevent the spread of dangerous substances. You have resistance to poison damage, and advantage on saving throws against poison and disease. **Languages (0).** You are not capable of speech yourself, but you can understand, read and write Common and one other language of your choice."

Please enjoy and critique! We're going to be playtesting the heck out of these traits for the next few months. **Koox Collectives** Koox are an offshoot of gremlins, mischievous fey creatures who relish any opportunity to turn well-working and orderly machines towards mischievous and entertaining purposes. An individual and exposed Koox resembles a diminutive orange goblin barely 3 inches tall, though they are rarely seen outside their scrap metal exteriors. Koox are born in litters of 20-30, and the mewling young quickly form a telepathic hive-mind and act as a single entity from a young age, despite their inherent squabbling. Each mischievous idea or mechanical inspiration that passes through ones mind is instantly transmitted to the collective and when genius strikes an entire teams worth of innovation is sure to follow. A Koox Collective is an assembly of 20-30 small machines, each housing a single Koox pilot. They build their tiny robots out of scrap metal and any innocent device they find unattended. They build their robotic shells to work in tandem, varying infinitely in appearance but somehow linking and connecting to form a coherent whole. Many Koox Collectives are malicious, taking pleasure in dismantling the establishment. But many are content to tinker away and only indulge in the occasional light-hearted prank. Exciting and dangerous locales are like magnets to Koox Collectives, so while rare, they do find themselves amongst the odd adventuring party. **Koox Collective Traits** Koox Collectives share a number of traits in common with each other. **Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1. &amp;#x200B; **Cyborg (Goblin Organics).** You are a flesh and blood creature with either symbiotic technological enhancements or are somehow grafted or contained within an inorganic body. Your age and lifespan are determined by the age and lifespan your organic components. In this case, you reach adulthood at age 8 and live up to 60 years. The inorganic parts of your body are often more resilient than flesh, you gain an innate +1 bonus to your AC. Your inorganic parts do not heal naturally; however, you can spend time repairing them while resting and you can receive healing through magical means and spending hit die as normal. Due to your mechanical components, you have vulnerability to lightning damage. **0 RP** &amp;#x200B; **Playfully Mischievous.** Your clique relishes comedy and hates rules, defying them both maliciously and in good fun. As such, your clique tends towards all Chaotic alignments. **0 RP** &amp;#x200B; **Hive Mind.** Rather than an individual, you are a swarm of much smaller creatures acting as a single creature. Your bizarre mind is the sum total of all the creatures that exist within you. Your component creatures cannot operate independently and if separated will only act to try and reunite the hive mind. You also gain the **Swarming Entity** trait. While you are a group rather than an individual, your hive mind makes you a close enough approximation for most. You count as a single Medium-sized humanoid creature for the purposes of spells and abilities. However, it is quite difficult to grab or shift a swarm and all attempts to grapple, reposition, and knock you prone are made at disadvantage. You also gain the **Swarming Movement** trait. You can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and you can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny-sized creature. You also gain the **Redundant Minds** trait. As a group of individuals rather than one singular mind, your consciousness is infuriatingly difficult to pin down. You have advantage on any saving throws made to avoid the charmed, paralyzed, and stunned conditions. You also gain the **Swarming Attacks** trait. You may make melee attacks against creatures you share a space with. However, your offensive capabilities are reduced when enough of your number is injured and the damage of any weapon attacks you make while at or below 50% of your maximum hit points is halved**.** **5 RP** &amp;#x200B; **Clattering Mechanisms.** Your design is lumbering, but moves with steadfast purpose, easily surmounting the obstacles in your path. Your walking speed is 25 feet, and you have a climb speed of 20 feet. **2 RP** &amp;#x200B; **Full Surround Sensors.** While your design has no enhancements to its sensors, it does have a lot of them, and they cover a full 360 radius. You cannot be surprised and will be able to act within surprise rounds. **1 RP** &amp;#x200B; **Scrap Weaponry.** Your design incorporates weaponry half engineered and half improvised. Sharp edges and spikes protrude from these fearsome if unreliable weapons. You can use your scrap weapons to make unarmed strikes. All attacks with them are made at disadvantage, but if you hit with them, you deal slashing or piercing damage (your choice) equal to 1d12 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. **2 RP** &amp;#x200B; **Rusted Heap.** Your design is cobbled together, disparate, improvised, and prone to sudden malfunctions when thwacked hard enough. Whenever you are struck with a critical hit you must make a concentration check as if you were concentrating on a spell. On a failed save you malfunction during your next turn and act as if confused, rolling a D10 and following the directions on the following chart: 1: The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn. 2-6: The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn. 7-8: The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn. 9-10: The creature can act and move normally. **-2 RP** &amp;#x200B; **Improvise Widget.** Your design is handy with technology and when pressed you can come up with solutions that rival arcane prowess. You may attempt to cobble together a device by spending 10 minutes tinkering. The result may reproduce the effects of any cantrip from the wizards spell list as if the spell was cast. Once used the device then breaks down and is destroyed. Devices made in this way will break down and become inert if not used within 24 hours of their creation. Starting at 5th level the device may instead reproduce the effects of any 1st level spell from the wizards spell list. Once you create a device with this trait, you cant do so again until you finish a long rest. **2 RP** &amp;#x200B; **Goblin-Kin.** Your people are descended from the goblinoid races. You can speak read and write Common and Goblin. **0 RP**"
78,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,The Undertaker. An alternative/rework to the school of necromancy for wizards. 1st Revision.,1,aezb3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/aezb3i/the_undertaker_an_alternativerework_to_the_school/,2019-01-12 07:07:51,"A few days ago, I posted an early conceptual draft for a ""rework"" to the school of necromancy over [here](URL Since then, I've been going over the design of that initial concept; removing features that are too similar to what we find in the core necromancer, building towards a theme that is more distinct and unique, and *attempting* to address balance/brokenness. I'm fairly satisfied with what I've made now - at least as far as the concept is concerned. With that, I'd love to present this for any feedback, concerns, or criticism any of you may have. Similar to my previous post, I am also including my own thoughts and concerns - if you'd like to see what I am trying to get at with this, do at least give them a quick skim over. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **The Undertaker** (School of Necromancy) You focus your study on magic that manipulates the life forces around you and draws on the transitive power of death. Most wizards who profess necromancy carry a dark reputation, they walk hand-in-hand with death, and the superstitious often believe that death and misfortune will follow in their path. While it is true that many of such wizards are drawn to the ideas of power and corruption, not all are evil. Many necromancers are simply fascinated by the study of death, life, and the afterlife, and some ply their skill as doctors or even protectors to the world of the living. &amp;#x200B; **Necromantic Grimoire** Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a Necromancy spell into your Spellbook is halved. &amp;#x200B; **Death Siphon** At 2nd level, you learn to fuel your magic with the transitional power of death. Whenever a creature within 60 feet of you dies, you can use your reaction to cast a necromancy spell as long as you have it prepared and it takes no more than 1 action to cast. Creatures that do not 'truly' die, such as undead or constructs, can not be used for this reaction. You do not expend a spell slot when you cast a spell in this way, but your potential list of spells and their power are determined by the power of the creature that has died. The effective spell slot level used by the spell is determined by the CR of the creature, as shown in the table below: *Creature's CR Spell Slot Level* Less than 1 1st 1-2 2nd 3-4 3rd 5-6 4th 7-8 5th 9-10 6th 11-12 7th 13-14 8th 15 and greater 9th If the effective spell slot level is greater than what you would normally have access to, you instead cast the spell at the highest level you are capable of using. Once you cast a spell using this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again. &amp;#x200B; ***\*\*Thoughts:*** *I really love the kind of focus, definition, and flavor this brings.* *I think in general, I've avoided a bag of rats kind of situation both through the CR scaling and the limited uses, though I am wondering if it should be knocked down to 1/long rest. The biggest reason I don't want to do that, is that I doubt this feature will usually be used with its maximum payout. For example, if a group of adventurers are working their way through some dungeon, the necromancer isn't gonna want to use this ability when they kill the CR 12 boss, because by that point they probably wiped most of the rest of the baddies and it wouldn't make much use of the spell's greater potential power. It makes more sense that they'd probably want to use it when weaker targets die in order to get a 'free' casting of a still ""decent"" spell.* *These numbers are of course most balanced around standard sized parties, which brings me to one of my biggest apprehensions about this feature. Smaller party sizes might in general be encountering lower CRs, and thus have less potential for powerful spells, while larger parties might be finding the opposite to be true. I'm not totally sure how I feel about that, or how much of an impact we'd actually be seeing there.* *I'm also a little worried about giving such a wide list of basic action spells as reactions. In essence this allows for a free spell during a round, with the only limitations based off of CR and it being necromancy. I haven't extensively gone through the spell list to see is some of these spells stick out as being broken when used in this sense, but I am aware that it is absolutely possible.* *I limited the maximum spell level to what you'd normally be capable of for one primary reason; this is not a sorcerer, its a wizard. You are using the magic, so you are limited by your own capabilities as opposed to the magic using you to express its own capabilities.* *Also undead and constructs can't be used as a source. 'Cause they don't die. I'm tempted to make an exception for undead, but I'm leaving it off for now.* &amp;#x200B; **Undertaker's Expertise** At 6th level, your study of necromancy and close acquaintance with death has begun to extend your understanding in these areas beyond things purely magical. You can consider yourself proficient in the respective skills, and can add double your proficiency bonus to the check, in any of the following situations: \- Whenever you make a Wisdom (insight) check on an undead creature or a Wisdom (survival) check to track them. \- Whenever you use a Wisdom (medicine) or Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine or discover the cause of death for a creature. \- Whenever you make a Wisdom (medicine) check to diagnose wounds or afflictions effecting a creature or to stabilize one. &amp;#x200B; ***\*\*Thoughts:*** *Is it too crunchy?* *I like the utility in this a lot, and I feel like it really enhances the theme I am trying to go for here. This might be a dark, grim, wizard who gains power from death, but they are also skilled students of their craft. It made sense to give them some medical knowledge as well as an enhanced familiarity with undead. I think the idea of a necromancer who can fill the role of a doctor, investigator, or maybe even undead hunter is pretty neat.* *The reason I chose double proficiency instead of proficiency is because I feel like most of these situations are niche enough that just slapping proficiency into the mix would miss the point. I also am not fond of penalizing players for building their characters in a certain way, and I didn't want this feature to come off as being useless to a wizard who may already have picked up proficiency in these areas. It was a bit of a toss-up between this and advantage but in the end I felt 'expertise' was the way to go.* *Also, they are mostly wisdom skills. So, unless you're speccing into Wis and Int, chances are the skill will not shine as much as it could if it was using your primary stat, which I like. I haven't totally wrapped my head around how this will incentivise SAD, but I think it is probably a good thing?* &amp;#x200B; **Cloaked by the Veil** Starting at 10th level, your spells draw you closer to the spirit realm, blurring the lines between the world of the dead and the world of the living. As long as you are concentrating on or under the effects of a necromancy spell that you cast you become wreathed in a subtle deathly aura, granting you the following benefits: \- When a creature that you can see within 30 feet makes an attack against you, you can use your reaction to lash out at it with necrotic power. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or else it makes the attack with disadvantage, and can only move at half of its normal speed until the end of it's next turn. \- you have vision into the ethereal plane within 30 feet. \- you can verbally communicate with any undead creature as though you both shared a common language. &amp;#x200B; ***\*\*Thoughts:*** *I added the stipulation for concentration/spell effects because it rewards casting spells, which I want to do for the wizard. As far as flavor is concerned - I feel 'so so' about this feature. The effects do fit for my idea of the necromancy wizard, but I think they may stray a bit away from the scientific/arcane side of necromancy and towards the spiritual/mystical side of things. I could see this being the kind of thing a warlock, cleric, or druid might be getting, just as much as a wizard.* ***The reaction:*** *I had a lot of trouble figuring this one out, and I still have some mixed feelings on the execution. I had been tossing around some other ideas, such as afflicting fear or dealing necrotic damage. And I'm not too sure if I like the trigger for the effect - I may want to go a route that makes it a little more offensive.* *- I like the idea of inflicting disadvantage on the attack roll, because it gives you more insurance to retain concentration on whatever spell you could be concentrating on. I feel that it also fits thematically, with necromantic power inhibiting a creature's physical (or mental) skill. My only concern here is that this might step on the toes of necromancy spells like blindness/deafness, bestow curse, or eyebite.* *- I am* ***really*** *on the fence about the ""slow"" effect. While I think it fits with the theme (burdening, or exhausting a creature with necromantic energy), I don't think it is necessarily that desirable of an effect for a necromancy wizard, and I am worried that it bogs down the feature with too much information/complexity.* ***The other stuff:*** *These effects are fairly ribbon - they do have their benefits, but once again these are situational and niche. Thematically, I think its great - you have perception into a plane that is tied to the realm of death, and you have more incentive to communicate with the undead, potentially opening them up as an easier source of information. This of course is really limited; a lot of undead could already probably communicate with you, and it is more of an issue of hostility/ not wanting to share any information that probably keeps this from happening in most games. Regardless of this however, it still leaves the door open to ""Oh, well, maybe we don't share a language, guess what - not an issue"", and in my setting, where undead are not necessarily as closely tied to the evil side of things it could absolutely see some greater use. As far as zombies or skeletons are concerned, they can't speak, but I don't see that as a problem personally because I would probably rule in most cases for my own games that they wouldn't be able to retain (most) memories of their past lives, and the information they'd choose to think about or pay attention to is probably worthless to a wizard, and I think plenty of other DMs would also take an approach similar to this.* ***Overall:*** *Might be too verbose and complex? I think a big problem in a lot of my design is that it lacks simplicity. While complexity does add a lot of nice flavor, it can really become burdensome and also can start to become limiting on the player.* &amp;#x200B; **Empowered Death Siphon** Beginning when you reach 14th level, you can unleash a dark surge of necrotic energy directly after you cast a spell using your Death Siphon feature. You subject creatures of your choice within 60 feet to a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature takes necrotic damage equal to half of your wizard level and suffers from vulnerability to necrotic damage until the end of your next turn on a failed save, or half as much damage and no additional effects on a successful save. You can target a number of creatures equal to the effective spell slot level used, or you can swap out a potential target for one of the following effects: \- one target of your choice suffers disadvantage on the saving throw against this feature. \- one target of your choice is frightened by you until the end of your next turn if they fail the saving throw against this feature. \- one target of your choice can be up to an additional 60 feet away. You can apply more than one of these effects per creature, as long as the effective spell slot used allows for it. For example, if you were to cast a spell with a 4th level slot using your death siphon feature, instead of targeting 4 different creatures with your empowered death siphon, you could target 1 creature and apply all three of these additional effects. &amp;#x200B; ***\*\*Thoughts:*** *I hope this ability makes sense. I struggled with being able to word it in a way that is intuitive which is probably not a good sign- again, another feature that tends toward complexity. Instead of adding something new, this one just improves something we'd already be doing. I like the way that Death Siphon works because it feels really conceptually fitting, and it triggers off of events that are memorable. From the player's point of view it seems likely that they will be noticing when creatures are dying, and it should be pretty easy to remember that they have a feature that takes advantage of that. The issue really comes in when the player asks ""Ok, now* ***what*** *is it that I am able to do when a creature dies?"" It is also a bit more complex than a simple upgrade to Death Siphon, instead of a flat numerical increase to the power of Death Siphon, it says ""****If*** *you use Death Siphon,* ***than*** *you can also use* ***this****.""* *I haven't done anything other than a really brief skim over the math here - but like Death Siphon, I am worried that this may have tipped balance in party sizes that are smaller or larger.* &amp;#x200B; \*\*\****Final Thoughts:*** *I feel the best about the 2nd and 6th level features. They both feel really thematically defining to me in a good way, and I don't want to change their nature too much, if anything I'd rather tweak their mechanics slightly as needed. I could definitely see the 10th and 14th level features changing significantly, but I'd rather seek feedback about them and maybe playtest them a bit before doing so.* *Mechanically and particularly mathematically, I think this probably needs much deeper investigation as far as balance is concerned, particularly in relation to the 2nd and 14th level features.* &amp;#x200B; Let me know what you folks think! I really appreciate any feedback!"

I used the Barbarian &amp; Paladin as inspiration... So you can be a paladin like support without the oath... Just a pact Your Patron is a Valkyrie (/vkri, -kari, vl-, vlkri) the chooser of the slain""),one of a host of female-like celestial who choose those who may die in battle and those who may live. The valkyries bring their chosen to the afterlife of thier Diety. Some, like you, they send back. However, your honor has impressed your Valkyrie so much that she has allowed you to become her sponsored here on this plane of existence. Just as your Patron, you are drawn to those that seek Battle, not to Heal, but to defend if at all possible. You will find yourself always ready for a confrontation, eager to participate, to defend those you find worthy of your defenses. Expanded Spell List: The Valkyrie lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you. 1st) Divine Favor, Shield of Faith 2nd) Lesser Restoration, Silence 3rd) Counterspell, Spirit Guardians 4th) Find Greater Steed, Banishment 5th) Greater Restoration, Raise Dead 1st - Valkyries Spear Your Patron down not send you into Battle without preparation in thier art. You learn to use Shields and expertly use spears. Celestial spearwork: When you use a spear, you can use your Charisma Modifier for attack and damage rolls, your Celestial Attunement also gives any spear you use an additional die of damage in your hands. {Example - Instead of spear(1D6/1D8) they are spear (1D8/1D10).} Charismatic Defense - As long as you are unarmored and holding a shield, you can add your Charisma to your AC.

While within this fury, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing any armor (you can still use a shield): You have advantage on all Charisma checks and Charisma saving throws. When an Ally within 5ft of you is attacked you can use your reaction to add your Charisma bonus to thier AC until the start of your next turn. You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage; and are resistance to the Charmed and Fear status effects also. You can cast spells while in a fury as long as the are touch only spells. Your fury lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if your allies are not engaged in Battle or you are knocked unconscious or if you have died. You can also end your fury on your turn as a bonus action. 6th lvl - Defiant Defense While engaged in Battle, as a bonus action, you can let out a triumphant roar to bolster your allies defenses and negate your enemies attacks. Every ally within 30 feet of you gains a +2 defense for 1 minute and every Enemy loses thier reaction for 1 minute.

Area in Holy Radiance for 24 hours, effectively making the area Hallow. Hallow - You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy (or unholy) power. The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect a hallow spell. The affected area is subject to the following effects. First, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can't enter the area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those types of creatures from this effect. Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an effect offered by the GM. Some of these effects apply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as orcs or trolls. When a creature that would be affected enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area. Courage. Affected creatures can't be frightened while in the area. Darkness. Darkness fills the area. Normal light, as well as magical light created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell, can't illuminate the area. Daylight. Bright light fills the area.

The celestial disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The celestial is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the celestial, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you), as long as they don't violate its alignment. If you don't issue any commands to the celestial, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. The GM has the celestial's statistics. - Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until after a long rest. "

83,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,Modifying Skills And Combat To Match My DM Style,1,ahd6qq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/ahd6qq/modifying_skills_and_combat_to_match_my_dm_style/,2019-01-19 05:06:39,"I've spent plenty of time working on my own systems to meet my preferences as a DM. I've decided instead to see what it'd look like if I made changes to D&amp;D and see how it goes. Below is what I'm thinking. As for my DMing style: I don't like referencing rules/DCs so I improvise often, I like the tactical element of combat, I feel like combat is the only area where rules must be specific and balanced, I like RP for RP's sake, and I feel that spells overpower the usefulness of skills. **Skills / Character Creation** I believe that not having enough skills limits the ability to be creative. However, I also believe that spells can cancel out skills (Invisibility &gt; Stealth, Fly &gt; Athletics, etc.). Therefore, all classes that do not get spell level 9 at some point receive 2 more skills. One must be from their class skills and the other can be any other skill or tool. Classes that eventually receive 9th level spells only receive 1 extra skill, which must be a class skill. No additional benefits are provided for multi-classing. In addition, when attempting to perform some sort of social skill check (any skill check that is meant to influence or avoid influence by another sentient being: Diplomacy, Intimidate, Persuasion, Performance, Insight) you may use another skill as long as it is relevant to the situation. A Barbarian might use Athletics in place of Intimidate, a Rogue might use Stealth to convince the Thieves Guild to let them in (""I stole Xyz, I'm worthy""), etc. This is up to DM discretion. **Combat** In order to improve the importance of strategy I'm adding the following new rules. *Flanking:* If an combatant is fighting two other characters that are on opposite sides of them, each successful melee attack adds 1d4 damage. *Dynamic Combat:* If you hit a character with a melee attack during your turn, you may choose to reduce the damage inflicted in exchange for moving the target. The target must be your size or smaller. For every 2 damage you reduce your damage by (before resistance, vulnerability, etc. is determined), you may move the target by 5 feet. You can move your target up to 10 feet per turn. Targets that are smaller than you move twice the amount (10 ft for 2 damage, 20ft for 4 damage). If you have remaining movement, you may choose to follow the target. Neither character's movement provokes Attacks of Opportunity, but may allow other characters to no longer be threatened, setup a flank, allow you to run away, etc. If the character would move into some form of environmental danger (off a cliff, into fire, into a pit, etc.) you must perform an Athletics check to force them into that final bit of dangerous movement. However, this Athletics check does not require the use of an Attack, just the 2 points of damage reduction. *Difficult Terrain:* When attempting to travel through difficult terrain, you must perform an Acrobatics skill check. The base DC is 10 (but the GM may increase it due to other circumstances). On a failure you provoke an attack of opportunity. "

If your hit points are less then half of your hit point maximum when you take damage from this trait, your speed is halved and you are considered to be poisoned until your hit points are restored to over half your hit point maximum. Finally, if you are reduced to 0 hit points by this trait you die. &amp;#x200B; **Dehydration** You are composed of a large amount of liquid and as such, you fare poorly in the burning environments. You have disadvantage on saving throws against Extreme Heat or other heat or fire related saving throws, as well as you have a vulnerability to fire damage. &amp;#x200B; **Ooze Nature** Your creature type is both humanoid and ooze.

89,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,Bloodhunter subclass: Order of the fractured Mind,1,ae569g,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/ae569g/bloodhunter_subclass_order_of_the_fractured_mind/,2019-01-09 20:21:03," Hi! this is my super early concept for a psionic based subclass for Matthew Mercers Bloodhunter. Most of the level features are done, except for the 11th level feature, because I still don't know what I should put in there. If you have any ideas, please put them in the comments so I can complete the subclass and begin to start to balance it and do some final play-testing. also if you have any constructive criticism or problems with what already exists in the subclass please feel free to post it and i'll try and address your concerns. \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- When you reach third level the strain of fighting eldritch horrors and monsters from the depths of the multiverse finally takes its toll, breaking your mind under the mental stress. This awakens your dormant latent psionic abilities, see the *psionic disciplines* section of the unearthed arcana mystic class (page 9) for the general rules of using powers. ## Psionics At 3rd level you gain access to psionics talents and disciplines as explained below. **Talents** You learn the *unearthly terror* talent and one additional talent of your choice. You gain one more at 10th level. **Psi points** The fractured mind Psionics table shows how many psi points you have to use your discipline effects. The table also shows your psi limit. You regain all expended psi points after you finish a long rest. **Disciplines known** Beginning at level three you know one discipline of your choice. The disciplines known column of the fractured mind Psionics table shows when you learn more disciplines. In addition, whenever you gain a level in this class you can replace one discipline you know with a different one of your choice. **Psionic abilities** Intelligence is your Psionic ability for your Psionic disciplines. You use your intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Psionic discipline or when making an attack roll with one. **Discipline save DC** = 8 + proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier **Discipline attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier | **Blood hunter level** | **Talents known** | **Disciplines known** | **Psi points** | **Psi limit**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |3|2|1|4|2| |4|2|1|6|2| |5|2|1|6|2| |6|2|1|6|2| |7|2|2|14|3| |8|2|2|14|3| |9|2|2|14|3| |10|3|2|17|3| |11|3|2|17|3| |12|3|3|17|5| |13|3|3|27|5| |14|3|3|27|5| |15|3|3|27|5| |16|3|4|32|5| |17|3|4|32|6| |18|3|4|32|6| |19|3|4|38|6| |20|3|4|38|6| &amp;#x200B; # Corrupted Maledict At 3rd level your warped and broken mind realises how to amplify and corrupt your blood maledict by infusing it with your psionic powers to create even more potent curses, but at a greater cost to your health and your sanity, this can only be done once before taking a long rest. When activating a corruption you take damage equal to the roll of your crimson rite die and an additional damage equal to your crimson rite die, you also must roll a d20 for an insanity effect from the insanity table below, this effect lasts for 1 minute. On each of your turns you can use your action to make a wisdom save against your discipline save DC, on a successful save the effect ends. &amp;#x200B; |d20|Insanity effect| |:-|:-| |1,20| You experience Vivid hallucinations and have disadvantages on Ability checks | |2,19| You Begin to suffer from extreme paranoia and has disadvantages on charisma and wisdom checks | |3,18| You are blinded (25%) and deafened (75%) | |4,17| You begin to experience extreme tremors and ticks, you have disadvantages on attack rolls, ability checks and saving throws involving strength and dexterity | |5,16|You affected as though you are under the effect of a *confusion* spell, the *confusion* effect | |6,15|You become frightened and must use their actions and movement each round to flee the area of combat | |7,14|You retreat into your mind and become paralysed until you take damage | |8,13| You become attached to a lucky charm such as a person or object. And has disadvantages on all rolls when more than 10ft from it | |9,12|You begin to suffer from partial amnesia. The character knows who he or she is and retains racial traits and class features, but doesn't recognise other people or remember anything that happened before the madness took effect. You have disadvantage on all saving throws| |10,11| You experience a powerful delusion. The DM will choose a potion. You imagine that you are under its effects | **Blood curse of binding corruption:** the subject becomes paralysed and begins to take 1d6 damage every turn until they succeed the strength check. **Blood curse of the eyeless corruption:** if the subject manages to hit a creature they take half the amount of damage to a maximum of your blood hunter time four. **Blood curse of the fallen puppet corruption:** the creature can make two attacks, one on each of your turns. **Blood curse of the fending rite corruption:** the creature casting the spell gains a disadvantage to the dexterity roll. **Blood curse of the marked corruption:** the marked target gains a vulnerability to your rite damage type until the end of your next turn. **Blood curse of mutual suffering corruption:** the creature takes an additional 1d8 psychic damage ignoring any resistance. **Blood curse of purgation corruption:** The target creature has an advantage on the saving throw. **Blood curse of the spell sunder corruption:** roll a dexterity check against the caster level, if you succeed on the throw you catch and throw the spell back at them. # Psychic Backlash At 7th level, when an enemy attack deals damage you can spend 2 psi points to reflect 1d8 points of Psychic damage back to them. # (11th level feature still In progress) # Strengthened Mind At 15th level your mind has grown more accustomed to the strange and terrible power that resides within it. once per long rest when you use a corrupted maledict you can choose to ignore the additional requirements to use it. # Fractured reflection At 18th level you have gained control over your powers and have discovered how to turn the negative side effects against your enemies. Now whenever you use your corrupted Maledict you can transfer the negative effects over to the nearest enemy. (PDF version will be made when 11th level feature is completed)"
90,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,Chaos Jester,1,9x781h,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/9x781h/chaos_jester/,2018-11-15 14:09:24,"I'm sure this is something that people have come up with before, but I think it'd be fun to have some sort of jester like monster that warps things around it. Ice damage changes to fire, lightning to acid, and radiant changes to necrotic with the opposite also being true. Walking speeds change to fly speeds and swimming to tunneling. This way they'd constantly be floating around without worrying about terrain. A dispel magic would set off a wild magic event while any wild magic events would either be treated as a dispel magic or anti-magic zone. Detect magic would register as no magic what so ever. True seeing would cause you to see all kinds of crazy things...you get the idea. Just make this a wacky character with the motive of just wanting to amuse him/herself. They could use greater teleport x-times per day? This would let them pop in on the party and mess with them, then just leave. Maybe make them immune to +3 and +2 weapons, have resistance against +1 and standard weapons, and a vulnerability to unarmed damage? I dunno. Has this been done before? Good idea? Bad? What do y'all think? Any way that you can recommend to refine this? "
91,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,5e Stone Cursed Race,1,9yc878,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/9yc878/5e_stone_cursed_race/,2018-11-19 12:57:55,"Hey, Had a character idea for a Wizard cursed into a stony form, inspired by the Wizard from Mask of Eternity ""Twasn't enough"", and the Stone Cursed Monster in MToF. Let me know what you think. ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength increases by 1, your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score decreases by 2. ***Age.*** Stone Cursed cease to age, and function until their bodies are destroyed. ***Alignment.*** Stone Cursed tend toward no particular alignment. ***Size.*** Stone Cursed are similar in height to humans but weigh at least twice as much thanks to their statuesque bodies. ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 20 feet. ***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language. ***Stone Form.*** Your body is formed of a magical moveable stone, granting you the following benefits * Your Armour class equals 17, your dexterity modifier does not influence this number. * You are immune to the Petrified condition. * You are immune to Poison Damage and the Poisoned Condition. * You have vulnerability to Bludgeoning damage. * Any non magical, non living, object you carry on your person starts to slowly turn to stone, completely turning to stone after 1 min. The weight of the object is doubled, the item's other statistics of the item are unaffected. An item no longer on your person reverts to its original form after 1 min. ***Fists of Stone***. Your grip is incredibly difficult to shift, you have advantage on ability checks made to maintain a grapple, or hold on to an object. Your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. ***False Appearance.*** You can use your action to remain motionless and become indistinguishable from a normal statute until you move, take an action or a reaction."
92,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,Lore Master Redone: The Theoretical School,1,a1ebt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/a1ebt4/lore_master_redone_the_theoretical_school/,2018-11-29 16:06:49,"A lot of you know how unreasonable lore master was in unearthed arcana, so much so that not only did it not make it to Xanathar's guide but the original pdf seems to have vanished. However the idea behind it was great and it would be a shame to see it disappear so I decided to take a step forward and make the necessary changes. So the most noticeable problem is that Lore Master was a combat ready wizard when he was supposed to be theoretical one. In other words he was able to do things on the fly, if changing spells this way was so easy as to be able to do it at level 2, the magic in dnd should have been way different to what we have now, the main point of wizards is that they need to study and prepare. With that in mind I'm renaming it The Theoretical School to go in line with other phb arcane traditions. &amp;#x200B; Here it is: &amp;#x200B; The Theoretical School focuses on the understanding of the underlying mechanics of magic. It is the most academic of all arcane traditions. The promise of uncovering new knowledge or proving (or discrediting) a theory of magic is usually required to rouse its practitioners from their laboratories, academies, and archives to pursue a life of adventure. Followers of this tradition are a bookish lot who see beauty and mystery in the application of magic. &amp;#x200B; Thinker Starting at 2nd level, your understanding of spells requires you to focus on a few topics. If you are proficient in Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion, you double that proficiency Additionally you are able to quickly plan out a plan of action, by preparing for 12 seconds before an encounter, you can use your intelligence modifier on your initiative instead of dexterity. To gain this benefit you must be preparing for that encounter and must see your enemies. &amp;#x200B; &gt;I was unsure if i should add investigation to that list, but investigation could be way to useful and i don't see why a wizard would study it so thoroughly. &gt; &gt;Also requiring him to be ready to benefit from intelligence makes thematic sense and 2 round of preparation is enough where even a botched ambush by the enemy could still take away that benefit. &amp;#x200B; Minor Creations. At 2nd level, through your intensive studies you have started to find way to adapt and modify spells. By spending Gold and Time of the appropriate level, you can adapt a spell of level 1 or higher that you already know to create and add a modified copy of it to your spell book, they count as two separate spells and must be prepared separately. If the spell does acid, cold, fire, lighting, poison or thunder damage, you can change its damage type to another one from that list. If the spell does force, necrotic, or radiant, you can change it to another one from that list. &amp;#x200B; &gt;This should balance out the problems most people have with spell secrets, most creatures either have resistances or vulnerabilities to necrotic and radiant, so you can gain a lot of advantage by choosing those while making it more situational, or play it safe and go with force where barely anyone has either resistance or vulnerability. &gt; &gt;I also added poison to the main list as I feel poison is underrepresented. &gt; &gt;Making it spells that need to be transcribed to your spell book and prepared separately keeps the flavor while restraining metagaming. &amp;#x200B; Proficient Caster At 6th level, your expertize of the act of casting gives you additional options at the expense of you reserves. When you cast a spell with a higher level slot, you can forgo the listed bonus and instead use one of the following: * You double the range of the spell for each slot level higher than required. * You double the duration of the spell for each slot level higher than required. * You halve the casting time of the spell for each slot level higher than required. * You double the area of effect of the spell every two slots higher than required. These bonuses grow exponentially (x2, x4, x8, x16, x32 and so on) Additionally when casting a ritual spell you can expend a slot of level 1 to lower the ritual casting time to 1 minute. &amp;#x200B; &gt;Ok this one is in my opinion the most interesting feature, the fact there is no effect that raises damage should resonate with the fact that in essence this is not a war wizard, wizards of this school focus on the usability and potential of spells not the raw power &gt; &gt;Should be noted that the effects can be mixed, so you can double the range twice and the duration once and use the normal effect increase as well, as long as you keep count of the level it ends up requiring. &gt; &gt;Also should be noted that this means you can cast spells that usually don't have bonuses when you use higher level slots with these effects. &amp;#x200B; Reverse Engineering At 10th level, your knowledge of magic allows you to recreate almost any spell just by observing it. When you see a spell being cast, you can attempt to memorize it, roll and Intelligence Arcana check against 10 + The Spell level On a success, you maintain it in you memory, you can then later transcribe it into your spell book, if the spell is not on the wizard spell list you must again succeed on a Intelligence Arcana check or Religion if it is a Cleric or Paladin spell against 20 + double the spell level, if you succeed you are able to recreate the spell as a Wizard one. On a failure you forget how the spell was cast. You may only keep one spell in your memory at all times. &amp;#x200B; &gt;This class is about the study of magic and not the battle itself, learning spells this way gives the player more options on learning them, the book of a theoretical wizard should be a full one, and learning how to duplicate the spells of other is also something that should interest wizards. &gt; &gt;Keep in mind you are not mimicking it, you are finding ways to reproduce a result, so although you may be able to cast a spell of same effect as a paladin, the spell is not a divine spell, just a replica. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Major Creations At 14th level, your studies have come through, you are mastering all forms of magic, you should probably get your diploma. You gain proficiency with alchemist supplies, if you already had proficiency it is doubled. The gold and time required to create a potion is halved. The gold required to create a magical item is halved, if you expend a spell slot you can increase the speed at which you create such items for the day, 1st for common, 3rd for uncommon, 5th for rare, 7th for very rare, and 9th legendary. You can now attempt to create spells from scratch!. For this you must communicate very well with your DM to decide on what is possible and the requirements as well as what level the spell would end up as, he may also refuse for any reason. As a guide line, You must expend 5x the gold and time to research and create such a spell. &amp;#x200B; &gt;This is the essence of what this class is about, practicing the theory, whats possible and whats not. This may seem as a lackluster last feature to some and an incredibly op for others, it is mostly dependent on the DM and what he allows in the game, if there is good communication on both sides this will be a good feature both in flavor and use. &gt; &gt;All in all an expert Theoretical Wizard could craft a common magical item in a single day of hard work, but even the best of them will take time with the most intricate ones, as well as giving up his most powerful spell every day if he really wants to work hard on it. &amp;#x200B; I'm posting it here first to flesh things out before moving to r/UnearthedArcana so throw your critics at me. Like I mentioned before this class is about the modification of magic more so than it's use. it's a class of a lot of flavor and one that need a good relationship with the DM, optionally this class could maybe sell the spells it create, but i feel that is unbalanced for obvious reasons, and odd as the world would probably already have developed the most basic ones. It's always awesome to see a Frost ball, or a Fire stream (fire lighting) happen."

Each effect would be activated after a successful weapon attack and then a failed save (effect duration one minute). I've been working off the idea that the effect should be about equivalent to a third level spell on a single target. Status effects that aren't as powerful get additional damage for the given element. The only one I hope isn't obvious is for fire, because it's so bland and resisted. The idea there is that bludgeoning/slashing/piercing damage vulnerability is increased a step, except in the the case of immunity (immunity to an element is an auto-save against any effect). The other that wouldn't be obvious is the distance on the force element. In this case the effect is to grant a ranged attack, with the prone effect being subject to a save. Element | Save | Effect | Description :---------:|:-----:|:-------:|:----------------- Fire|Con|entropy|Target takes more damage from bludg/pierce/slash attacks (max?&gt;vuln&gt;norm&gt;resist) Acid| Dex| weaken armor| Target takes -2 AC penalty, 2d6 damage at the start of its turn Lightning| Wis| stunned| Target stunned (no actions or reactions, speaks falteringly, fails STR/DEX saves and attackers have advantage) Poison| Con| poisoned|Target poisoned (disadv on attacks and ability checks), 2d4 damage at the start of its turn Cold| Con| slow | Target slowed (speed is halved, and it can't use reactions. It can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.) Necrotic| Con| life drain| Target takes 3d4 necrotic damage. That as well as normal damage returned to wielder as healing. Radiant | Wis | blind | Target blinded (disadv on attacks, attacks against at adv), 2d6 burst damage Psychic | Wis | confusion |Target acts as the Confusion spell Force | Str | prone/dist | Wielder makes attacks at range (30/60); Target saves versus knocked prone "

Some aspects are usable at will, like cantrips. Some aspects are usable a number of times equal to your Wisdom-modifier, and some aspects are usable once per day. Also, some aspects have a static ability. Before leveling up to level 2, I'd love some input on the aspects I've made so far: power level, if the uses per day seems reasonable, and anything else you can think of.

95,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,5th Edition OC/Homebrew: Jorogumo (Spider Mistress),28,9bdr2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/9bdr2r/5th_edition_ochomebrew_jorogumo_spider_mistress/,2018-08-30 08:02:58,"Within old forests and forgotten ruins, the Jorogumo lies waiting for its humanoid prey. Anxious for the moment where it enters its domain, so that it can draw it closer and closer to its lair where it is too late to scream for help. Much like a spider in wait, a trap set by a Jorogumo is inescapable by none at all. This is a monster created to give the DM a trap to set against his or her player, and one that should be hard to escape, as all spider within the forest should be working for the Jorogumo. Lair and Regional actions are still at work. The CR of the monster is not calculated correctly as of yet. [Jorogumo in humanoid form - Artist: chibi-oneechan - Image Source: https:\/\/URL *Processing img wqx6nrdij3j11...* # Jorogumo *Medium monstrosity (shapechanger), neutral evil* **Armor Class** 17 (natural armor) **Hit Points** 135 (18d8 + 54) **Speed** 30 ft.

Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies. ***Avoidance.*** If the jorogumo is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails. ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The jorogumo's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: At will: *animal friendship* (spiders only), *detect thought, druidcraft, speak with animals* (spiders only) 3/day each: *bestow curse, charm person, pass without trace* 1/day each: *conjure animals* (in the form of two giant spiders or four swarms of spiders)*, hold monster, suggestion* ***Speak with Spiders.*** The jorogumo can communicate with spiders as if they shared a language. ***Spider Climb.*** The jorogumo can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. ***Web Sense.*** While in contact with a web, the jorogumo knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web. ***Web Walker.*** The jorogumo ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing. # Actions ***Multiattack.*** In spider form, the jorogumo makes two foreleg attacks. In humanoid form, it makes two claw attacks. In hybrid form, it can attack like a spider or a humanoid. ***Bite (Spider or Hybrid Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* \+6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also poisoned for 1 hour. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1d6 hours, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way. ***Claw (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* \+6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d12 + 4) slashing damage. ***Foreleg (Spider or Hybrid Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* \+6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. ***Web (Recharge 5-6).*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* \+6 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one Large or smaller creature. *Hit:* The target is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 16 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The effect ends if the webbing is destroyed. The webbing has AC 10, 5 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to bludgeoning, poison and psychic damage. "
96,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,PC Race: Sprigling; The Graceful Flower-Folk,6,8yqw8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/8yqw8q/pc_race_sprigling_the_graceful_flowerfolk/,2018-07-14 15:02:26,"# Sprigling Soft green flesh, big beautiful eyes, and bright petals in place of hair; no one can doubt the plant-like nature of the spriglings. # Tender Flowers Spriglings tend to live on the outside of civilization, deep in fey-enchanted woods, meadows or islands. They carve out small, idyllic grottoes filled with beautiful trees and flowers; oftentimes choosing places with a large amount of fey creatures. There they lounge in the sun, tend to their gardens, and enjoy themselves. If they do possess houses or structures these are usually only used to protect themselves from heavy rains and storms, or to avoid dangerous animals. Since many of these grottoes are led by powerful sprigling druids or are protected by fairies, these concerns are often a nonissue; leading many of the grottoes to seem simply like naturally occurring clearings (in forests) or stands of trees (in places like meadows,) rather than the dwelling place of a civilized race. Those that have had to fend off outside invaders, however, will often have barriers of wood or stone, as well as weapons; things that are very uncommon in most sprigling grottoes. # Encroaching Invaders Due to a sprigling's deep connection to plants and nature, they find the intrusion of other races to be a mild nuisance at best, and an abhorrent slaughter at worst. They work with the land to get what few things they need, causing as little damage as possible; when encountering outsiders, spriglings are usually appalled by the way they treat the surrounding land. Sprigling grottoes will usually try to warn the intruders away using any magical abilities they have or their fairy companions as threats if they don't possess weapons and other defenses, while the more well armed grottoes may either fight defensively, or simply attempt to wipe the intruders out. Depending on the nature and strength of the invaders, they may either leave the grotto alone, abandoning it to the spriglings, or they may simply kill and/or enslave all the spriglings (as best they can) and move on. Those that simply try to ignore or work around the grotto tend to run into trouble, as the spriglings, made aware of their presence, will constantly be attempting to make them leave; in some cases trying to wipe them out before they can do more damage to their home. # Spriglings in the Outside World While most spriglings live away from people in their wooded grottoes, many have ventured outside of their homelands. Some of them went willingly, driven by wanderlust or simple curiosity to see what else the world had to offer; however, many spriglings were forced to leave due to the destruction or loss of their home. Some had their grottoes attacked; those that survived either fled, were spared, or were enslaved. Others may have ended up becoming lost, either getting tricked by malevolent fairies or simply wandering too far into an unfamiliar area. However, most of the spriglings who live in the outside world are the descendants of these previous individuals, and many have fit in quite well in the wider world. While almost all feel at least a small connection to plants and to nature, you may come across the odd sprigling living in the heart of a metropolitan city. Many act as farmers, gardeners, or landscapers; while others use their intriguing and delicate appearance to great success as exotic dancers or escorts. And, sadly, in areas where slavery is legal you can find a few captured spriglings hanging on the arms of rich and powerful masters; in most places spriglings are praised by slave owners for their rarity and exoticism, and are shown off as trophies. # Sprigling Traits ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1. ***Age.*** Spriglings are naturally long-lived. They can usually live up to 600 years. ***Alignment.*** Spriglings grottoes generally prefer to just go with the flow, living lives of calm leisure. Spriglings tend towards neutrality. ***Size.*** Spriglings tend to stand between 5 and 6 feet in height, though they can be larger or smaller, and weigh between 60-100 lbs. Your size is Medium. ***Speed.*** Your speed is 30 ft. ***Floral Magic.*** You know the Druidcraft cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Goodberry once with this trait without expending material components, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the Barkskin spell once with this trait without expending material components, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells. ***Day's Warmth, Night's Chill.*** While you need not fear the burning heat of the sun, you do need to worry about the chill of winter. You have resistance to Radiant damage, but you have vulnerability to Cold damage. ***Plant Physiology.*** You are counted as both a humanoid and a plant, and are affected by spells that effect either. ***Plant Speech.*** You can speak, somewhat, with plants. They can understand the meaning of your words, and they can communicate emotions and concepts to you. You have advantage on all Charisma checks you make to influence plants and plant-based creatures. You also have proficiency in the Nature skill. ***Photosynthesis.*** You can absorb energy from the sun instead of eating. As long as you spend at least 1 hour outside (whether it was in an overcast area or not,) you are considered fed for the day. If you spend at least 1 hour outside in the rain, then you are considered watered for the day. ***Rooted.*** As a bonus action, you can plant yourself in a sturdy position. Your speed is reduced to 0 until you unroot yourself as a bonus action. During this time, you have advantage on checks and saving throws to avoid being moved or knocked prone. ***Languages.*** You know common and sylvan."

I'm preparing a short adventure in which the players are going to be twisted by the Far Realm. I want to introduce 4 new subclasses tailored just for this purpose. Below you can find Roguish Archetype I came up with recently. You can also check [Druid](URL ## Eye of Predator Starting at 3rd level when you choose this archetype, you can use your reaction to tell which creature within 60 feet of you is the most wounded. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) rolls to find this creature. ## Relentless Stalker Also beginning at 3rd level, you excel at fighting with isolated enemies. Whenever you attack a target and there are no other creatures (friends of foes) within 10 feet of it, you benefit from Sneak Attack and its die increases to d8. However, you can't Sneak Attack under any other circumstances. ## Void Conduit At 9th level, you become a vessel of unstable energy. Whenever you deal sneak attack damage, you gain one d10 die of unstable energy. You can hold up to 3 such dice. Once you have all 3 dice and make a successful melee attack, you may use your bonus action to add the dice to your total damage, dealing additional fire, frost, lightning or acid damage. The dice are lost after this attack. If you kill the target with the bonus damage, you don't loose one die. On your melee or ranged attack fumble, if you are holding at least one unstable energy die, it bursts and damages you with force damage equal to your level. You lose all held dice. ## Shifting Strike Starting at 13th level, if you move at least half your speed before making a melee attack, you can benefit from Relentless Stalker, even if you don't meet requirements. After the successful attack, you can use your reaction to teleport back to the location where you started your turn. You can use this feature once before completing a short or long rest. ## Far Realm Calling Beginning at 17th level, you can use your action to step into the Far Realm. For the duration of one round you disappear from your current plane and all effects affecting you are suspended. You return to the same or the closest unoccupied spot at the start of your next turn with five dice of unstable energy and one random effect from the Far Realm Effects table. The effect lasts until you finish a long rest. If you are already in the Far Realm, for the same duration its chaotic matter consumes you instead, and after that you the random effect. After you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest. ## The Far Realm Effects |***d4***|***Effect***| |:-|:-| |1|\-5 feet speed| |2|5d6+6 temporary HP| |3|resistance to necrotic damage, vulnerability to radiant damage| |4|deal additional 5 force damage with each successful attack, and the same amount to yourself|"

I would love to hear your thoughts! Sanguine Summoning (Lvl 5) Conjuration Casting time: 1 Minute Range: 90 feet Components: V,S,M (a drop of blood) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour You summon a Hemic Golem, which appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The golem disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The golem is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the golem, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you dont issue any commands to the golem, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. The Hemic Golem has the statistics of a Flesh Golem, with the following exceptions: - It loses its Aversion of Fire and Lightning Absorption features. - It deals necrotic damage with its slam attack. - It loses its darkvision, and has blindsight up to a range of 60 feet. - It has vulnerability to necrotic damage. - Each time the golem hits a creature with its slam attack, it gains temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt. - When the golem ends its turn without attacking a creature, roll for berserk. Bloodletting (Lvl 2) Necromancy Casting time: 1 Bonus action Range: 30 feet Components: S,M (a small knife) Duration: Instantaneous End either one disease or condition on a friendly creature. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. Afterwards, the target has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls and saving throws until the end of their next turn. Leech (Cantrip) Necromancy Casting time: 1 Action Range: 30 feet Components: V,S Duration: Instantaneous A series of black tendrils shoot out from your veins. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature within range. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage as the tubes extract their essence. You gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt, unless the target is Undead or a Construct. Seeing Red (Lvl 4) Enchantment Casting time: 1 Action Range: 120 feet Components: V,S,M (a red cloth) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute Choose a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration. While affected by this spell, the creature loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures as enemies, and it is incapable of perceiving anyone except for the creature closest to it. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, the spell ends. Corpse Explosion (Lvl 3) Abjuration Casting time: 10 minutes Range: Touch Components: V,S,M (a rusty nail) Duration: Until dispelled, triggered or cast on another target When you cast this spell, you inscribe explosive runes into a small or larger dead creature, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. While casting the spell, you can designate creatures that won't trigger the runes. When a tiny or larger creature comes within 5ft of the corpse, the runes detonate, forcing each creature within a 20-foot radius centered on the corpse to roll a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 10d4 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a succesful one. The radius of the spell is dependent on the size of the corpse used: SMALL - -5 radius MEDIUM - Unchanged LARGE - +5 radius HUGE - +10 radius At Higher Levels: You may target one additional corpse for every two slot levels above 3rd. Septicemia (Lvl 1) Evocation Casting time: 1 Action Range: 60 feet Components: S,M Duration: Up to 1 minute Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 poison damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, the target is poisoned for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends. At Higher Levels: The damage increases by 1d6 "

This just popped into my head, Ive still gotta whip up some fluff but these are dark Druids or necro-druids, sneaky forest assassins and boogie men. Not necessarily evil, simply frightening and sneaky. ##Circle of Shadows **2nd Level** ###Bonus Cantrip Upon joining this Circle you learn your the *Minor illusion* or *Chill Touch* Cantrip. *This is the optional ability, simply to get the theme across, though Im happy to remove it* ###Strength of the Shadows Your familiarity with the shadows and dark places has caused you to become resistant to necrotic damage, in addition you gain darkvision to 60ft, if you already have darkvision its range is instead increased by 30ft. *I find this Thematic, and reasonably strong, though Im keen to hear your thoughts* ###Shadow Form When you join this Circle at second level you learn the art of becoming a shadow. You may expend one use of your wild shape to become a *Shadow* (MM.269). The same rules apply as your regular Beast shapes and once youve used this ability, you cannot do so again until youve finished a long or short rest. At 10th level you may use your wildshape to assume this form as often as you wish. *before you panic, CR wise this is weaker than a moon druid, that said I know the potency of Shadows so until 10th level its limited to once per short rest, and from then till 20th its twice, in addition this form has a low AC and quite low health so I think its reasonable, though again criticisms are welcomed* ___ **3rd Level** ###Bonus spells At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the following circle spells whispered to you by the archdruid ghosts of the Circle of Shadows. Once you gain access a circle spell. You always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spelllist, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you, Druid Level | Circle Spells :-:|:-: 3rd |Shadow Blade, Darkness 5th |Bestow Curse, Fear 7th |Shadow of Moil, Evards Black Tentacles 9th |Mislead, Negative Energy Flood ___ **6th Level** ###Friend of Darkness Beginning at 6th level you may expend one use of you wildshape to summon a Shadow Mastiff (VGtM p.190) from the Shadows in an unoccupied space within 5ft of you as an action. The Shadow Mastiff is friendly to you and to your allies and acts on your initiative. You may command it as a bonus action on each of your turns. If you do not command it, the Shadow Mastiff will use its action to attack the nearest creature within sight that is hostile to you, if no hostile creatures are in sight it will instead stay within 10ft of you. The Shadow Mastiff lasts for 1 hour(?), or until it drops to 0 hitpoints or you dismiss it as a bonus action. Once you have used this ability you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest. *This, I feel, is awesome, and comparable in power to the Shadow Sorcerers Hound of Ill Omen whilst remaining different* ___ **10th level** ###Abyssal Enhancements At 10th level your ties with the Shadows have grown stronger, enhancing your abilities in the following ways, - You may Hide as a bonus action on each of your turns. - You may add double your Wisdom modifier to any stealth checks you make whilst in darkness or dim light. - When in darkness or dim light you have resistance to piercing, bludgeoning and slashing damage. - When you use your Shadow Form ability to become a shadow, you gain temporary hitpoints equal to your Druid level + your Wisdom Modifier, in addition that form loses its Sunlight Sensitivity and vulnerability to Radiant Damage. *This is the level where it all comes together, where you truly become the boogie man, I think it accomplishes that without being overly powerful* ___ **14th Level** ###Fear the Dark At 14th level the darkness brings you potency, if you hit a creature with a spell attack whilst either you or your target are in dim light or darkness, that spell deals additional necrotic damage equal to your Wisdom Modifier and the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Spell Save DC or become frightened of you until the end of its next turn. *i think this fits the theme, but may be too powerful, please let me know, also tell me if this adds too many rolls* ___ This is my first attempt at this class, written hastily before going to bed, please let me know what you think, all constructive feedback is deeply appreciated and I will make edits as per your suggestions!"
101,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,[5e Workshop] Potions with fun but mostly minor side-effects.,8,8rwzdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/8rwzdr/5e_workshop_potions_with_fun_but_mostly_minor/,2018-06-18 15:11:20,"So, RL medications have all kinds of side-effects, so why not apply that in D&amp;D, but in a much more fun manner? The idea is to bring some of that silliness of that Wild Magic Sorcerer table, but in potion form. Yes, some of these effects are directly pulled from that table. ###Wandering Alchemist Snake-oils and Purple Potions ""*All my potions work as advertised, its just sometimes they have ..curious ^^and ^^inconsistent.. side effects.*"" ""*Yes, all of my potions are purple, but thats why they are labeled.*"" ""*Look ok, I discovered a potion catalyst that makes potion brewing quicker, but it turns them purple ^^and ^^sometimes ^^they ^^have ^^side ^^effects. But quicker potion brewing means, cheaper prices for my customers. So take a look at my stock, and *"" When you drink one of the purple potions from this vendor, no matter what the potion is, roll 1d12 and consult the table for your side effects. If the result produces a spell and it normally requires concentration, it doesnt require concentration in this case. Additionally, the spell lasts for its full duration, unless otherwise noted. Lastly, these effects can not be dispelled, but the side effects are always temporary. 1 - You turn into a potted plant until the start of your next turn. While a plant, you are incapacitated and have vulnerability to all damage. If you drop to 0 hit points, your pot breaks, and your form reverts. 2 - The potion causes you to become confused as if you had cast Confusion on yourself, failing the saving throw. 3 - Your size decreases by one size category, as if you had cast the Reduce effect of the Enlarge/Reduce spell upon yourself. 4 - You are frightened by the nearest creature until the end of your next turn. 5 - Roll 1d10. You age changes by a number of years equal to the roll. If the roll is odd, you get younger, (minimum of 1 year old). If the roll is even, you get older. You are restored to your original age after 1d4 days. 6 - You become oddly flatulent for 1d4 days. Each flatus produces a pleasant aroma that attracts pixies, sprites, brownies, and other tiny-sized fae to you. Any bowel movements you have during this time, are rainbow colored and also have the same pleasant aroma that attracts tiny-sized fae. 7 - You can't speak for the next minute. Whenever you try, purple bubbles float out of your mouth. 8 - A illusionary doppelganger of yourself that only you can see and hear appears. It dislikes you and will taunt, ridicule, and belittle you for 1d4 hours. 9 - You become covered in spots that are the opposite color of your skin color, making you appear akin to a dalmatian for 1d4 days. 10 - You grow a magnificent long beard, despite your race or gender. The beard falls out after 24 hours, but can be shaved off sooner when convenient. 11 - Your skin grows a thick but short fur all over for 1d4 minutes. The fur is the color and pattern of red plaid. Oddly this increases your speed by 10ft. 12 - No side effect. Each time the Wandering Alchemist is encountered he will have a different stock of Rare or below potions or oils, and generally offers a 10% discount on the prices of the potions. Check out URL for pricing. Initially, he will not be interested in haggling, but if the PCs offer a deal for trading items he maybe interested in, then he will haggle. Items he maybe interested in are, items that either involve Alchemy or Transmutation of some form, such as Alchemy Jug, Universal Solvent, Transmutation spell scrolls, Very Rare potions and oils and similar. Additionally, the Wandering Alchemist will typically stock of the old-skool 3.5 potions that are now covered by the Enhance Ability spell. Potion of Price Effect * Bear's Endurance 300gp Drinker has advantage on Constitution checks and gains 2d6 temporary hp, for 1 hour. * Bull's Strength 325gp Drinker has advantage on Strength checks and his or her carrying capacity double, for 1 hour. * Cat's Grace 350gp Drinker has advantage on Dexterity Checks and does not take damage from falling 20ft or less if not incapacitated, for 1 hour. * Eagle's Splendor 225gp Drinker has advantage on Charisma checks, for 1 hour. * Fox's Cunning 200gp Drinker has advantage on Intelligence checks, for 1 hour. * Owl's Wisdom 250gp Drinker has advantage on Wisdom checks, for 1 hour. Note: The Out-of-Character reason why the potions are purple is so that players can easily say, ""I drink the purple haste potion"", and the DM will know that the potion has side effects to apply."

I hope* This is a first swing, a rough draft, feedback is appreciated! ##**Path of the bermench** ___ *Often beginning their life as a wizards apprentice, they find their powers by the misfiring of a new spell or exposure to a strange liquid. Now with pure arcane energy flowing through their veins their bodies begin to change and strengthen, granting them access to a variety of powers to be used for good or evil.* ___ **3rd Level** ###Iron Fists Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, your fists become imbued with raw arcane energy, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage. Whilst raging the arcane energy flows through them more intensely causing your fists to emit a slight glow. Unarmed strikes you make whilst raging deal an additional 1d6 force damage and count as magical for the sake of overcoming resistances and immunities. Both die increase at certain levels, 1d8 at 12th, and 1d10 at 18th. *punch things without sacrificing that 2d6 Greatsword, you still dont punch as much so I feel this wont step on the monks toes* ###Arcane Fortitude At 3rd level, the Arcane energies which flow through your body bolster you upon entering a rage. Whenever you enter a Barbarian Rage you become resistant to all damage types except psychic to which you gain vulnerability. *current thoughts are as follows as I dont want to step on totems toes ; add vulnerability to necrotic damage, save v exhaustion after taking psychic damage, save v frightened after taking psychic damage.

For the duration of your rage you gain a fly speed of 40ft.

In addition you may make a unarmed strike as a bonus action on each of your turns. *kinda a ribbon, but a powerful one, it links in with one of the nerfs for Arcane Fortitude* ___ **14th Level** ###Arcane Surge Starting at 14th level, upon entering a Barbarian Rage you gain one Arcane Surge. You may expend your Arcane Surge as an action to grant yourself one of the following effects, **Laser Vision**. As an action you release deadly arcane energy from your eyes. A beam of white hot fire 30 feet long and 5 feet wide shoots from your eyes in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This fire damage ignores resistances and immunities. **Arcane Flourish**. As an action you allow enormous amounts of magical energy to course through your veins. Until the end of your rage you are under the effects of the *Haste* spell, though it does not require concentration. **Arcane Regeneration**. For the duration of your rage, your bodies natural healing is enhanced, at the beginning of each of your turns in combat you regain 5 hit points, these hit points cannot exceed your hit point maximum.

103,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,Homebrew spells for custom class - feedback wanted,1,8u43a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/8u43a1/homebrew_spells_for_custom_class_feedback_wanted/,2018-06-27 07:55:03,"I am DMing a session where all my players are playing the Divine Guardian class, which is a custom class and we finished our third session on Sunday and I want to rebalance the class a bit by replacing some of their unused spells with some spells that would be more useful, but I had trouble finding ones from official sources that fit the flavor of their characters subclass. I also wanted to condense some spells into one, because the class has limited options for each spell level. Our characters are a Guardian of Mind, which is a scholar who dedicated his life to find knowledge and educate people. Original Spell: Message (Cantrip) Reason for replacement: never used, flavor, gameplay Replacement: Mental Note (cantrip) Mental Note: Bonus Action Self Instant SM (a writing utensil) You mentally jot down a piece of information you learned, allowing you to accurately recall it at any time within the next month. Original Spell: Detect Magic (1), Find Traps (2) Reason for replacement: condensing Replacement: Attuned Senses (1) Attuned Senses: Enchantment Self 5 minutes VSM (a glass eye, a plastic ear, a plastic nose, or a small model of a brain) You choose one sense: your hearing, sight, smell, or mind. If you choose hearing, you gain advantage to Perception (Wisdom) checks that require hearing. If you choose sight, your vision increases by 30 feet and you grants you dark vision up to your normal sight range. You have advantage to any Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. If you choose smell, you can detect any poisonous substances within 30 feet of you, and you have advantage on saving throws that involve inhaling harmful gases or vapors. If you choose mind, you gain advantage on any Investigation (Intellect) checks, and you have a passive ability to notice traps or magic within 30 feet or you. You can make an Arcana check to figure out the school of Magic. For every spell level above first, you can choose either to activate an additional effect or increase its duration by 5 minutes. You choose this for every level. Original Spell: illusionary script (1) Reason for replacement: never used, class needs more damage options. Replacement spell: Experimental Bolt (1, reflavored chaos bolt) Experimental Bolt: Evocation 120 feet Instant VS Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 + 1d12 damage. After you roll the damage, you roll an additional d8, and the number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type. 1 - Acid 2 - Cold 3 - Fire 4 - Force 5 - Lightning 6 - Thunder 7 - psychic 8 - Radiant After the spell deals its damage, you can record the results as a bonus action and attempt to use it the next time you cast the spell. If you have recorded a damage type and damage, after the GM says your spell hit, but before dealing damage, you can attempt to perform an Arcana check to replicate the previous results. If your Arcana check is greater than or equal the enemies AC, the spell does the same damage, as well as damage type, as the recorded time. If you have the Keen Mind feat or an equivalent feature that allows you to accurately recall information, you make the Arcana check with advantage. If you fail the Arcans check, you lose the recorded results and the spell misses. Original Spell: tongues (3) comprehend language (1) Reason for replacement: class feature has knowledge of languages and the ability to teach languages at higher level, so those spells are redundant once they unlock that feature Replacement: Bookworm (3) Bookworm: Conjuration 1 hour Touch SM - Ichor of the Globglogabgalab You create a miniature bookworm that crawls into the targets ear, which helps them read any text. They can read the text 3 times faster thar normal, and they can understand the text regardless of any language barrier, and can pick up on any hidden meaning. They can also read texts or murals as if they had true sight. Original Spell: confusion (4) Reason for replacement: flavor, class needs more damage options. Replacement: Devour Intellect (4) Devour Intellect: Instant 60 feet VSM (a spoon that has been in the home plane of a mindflayer or a similar creature) You force a creature to make an intellect saving throw. On a failed save, you deal 3d10 psychic damage and siphon a chunk of their knowledge, increasing your intellect score by their Intellect modifier until the end of your next long rest. You can only have your Intellect increased by the modifier of one creature at a time. Original Spell: phantasmal killer (4) Reason for replacement: flavor, subclass needs spells that dont do psychic damage so a creature with immunity doesnt force them out of options Replacement: Nervous Blast (4) Nervous Blast: Evocation Self Concentration, up to 1 minute SM - (twine or wires that resemble nerves) You harness the electric current within your nervous system to be able to fire a bolt of electricity every turn that hones in on the mind of a target within 120 feet. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or take 3d10 lightning damage or half damage on a successful save. On a failed save, their brain is fried from the electrical current and they become paralyzed until the end of their next turn. You can repeat this attack each turn this spell is active. Our second player is a Guardian of Creation, which is a giddy childlike spirit who is young at heart and has immense conjuration powers. Original Spell: dancing lights (cantrip) Reason for replacement (never used, flavor) Replacement: Quick Sketch Quick Sketch 1 action Enchantment Instant Self SM (a tool to draw with and a surface to draw on) Using this spell allows you to draw a picture in a single action that is created with incredible percision. It can be used again to add color or details to the picture. Original Spell: Magic Missile (1) Reason for replacement: flavor, balance Replacement; Paint Ball Bullets (1) Paint Ball Bullets Evocation 1 action Instant 120 feet SM - a miniature bucket of paint You create three magic bullets made of paint. You must roll a d6 for each ball, and the result determines the damage type of that ball. 1. Fire 2. Acid 3. Lightning 4. Poison 5. Cold 6. Thunder Each ball hits a visible creature of your choice. A ball deals 1d4+1 damage to its target. You can combine the balls into a single damage type, which you can choose based on the bullets summoned. Doing this increases the damage to 3d6+spell casting modifier. The balls all strike simultaneously and you can direct them to hit one creature or several. At higher levels, the damage increases by 1d4 + 1 per ball, or by 1d6 for a combined ball. A target can attempt to use its reaction to dodge a combined paint bubble, which requires a Dexterity saving throw equal to your spell casting modifier. If the target has a vulnerability to the damage type, they automatically fail the save. Original Spell: create food and water (3) create or destroy water (1) Reason for replacing: condensing, the destroy aspect of create food or water was against the nature of the class, flavor (no pun intended) Replacement: Magic Meal (1) Magic Meal: Conjuration 1 action Instant 30 feet VSM - a picture of the meal you wish to create. Creates a meal and a drink for a single person at a location you can see within 30 feet. This meal must be eaten within 10 minutes or the magic fades. If you cast this with a spell slot of third level or higher, you can create a container that keeps the meal fresh for up to 24 hours. Original Spell: color spray (1) Reason for replacement: it becomes obsolete at higher levels Replacement: Confetti Cloud (1) Confetti Cloud: 1 action Conc, up to 1 minute 60 feet Creates a cloud of multi colored dust in a 10 foot sphere within range, which causes any creature who walks in the cloud or who starts their turn in it to make a Constitution saving or become blinded. They can repeat the save at the start of their turns and regain their vision on a successful save As a bonus action, you can move the cloud up to 30 feet in any direction. Original Spell: Warding Bond (2) Reason for replacement: flavor, difficulty keeping track of resistance Replacement: Bond of Friendship (2) Bond of Friendship: Abjuration 1 action 8 hours SM - a token that symbolizes your frienship Creates a bond between a single willing ally for 8 hours. Anytime you or your friend take damage, either of you can use a reaction to take the damage instead. This spell ends early if the total damage received during the duration exceeds your maximum hitpoints. At Higher levels: you can create the bond between 1 additional target for every spell slot above 2nd, provided all targets are mutual friends. Original Spell: moonbeam (2) Reason for replacement: flavor, teamwork potential Replacement: Spotlight (2) Spotlight: 1 action Concentration, up to 1 minute. 60 feet VSM (a small light ball) Creates a spotlight in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder at a point chosen in range. It causes creatures of your choice who see a enemy in the spotlight to make a Wisdom saving throw at the beginning of their turn or be forced to use half or more of their movement to walk in the direction of the spotlight. When a hostile creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 radiant damage. Additionally, any creature in the spotlight gains a +5 bonus to Performance checks. Original Spell: goodberry (1) Reason for replacing: flavor, needs a damage option for 2nd level spell slots. Replacement: Sweet Tooth (2) Sweet Tooth: Transmutation Instant Self SM (a pinch of sugar) Magic causes one of your teeth to be coated by magical energy. You can rip out the tooth as a bonus action, doing 2d10 force damage to yourself. You can use this tooth as a ranged weapon to throw it as a homing projectile towards a target within 60 feet, which causes the tooth to shatter once it reaches its target, causing them to recieve damage equal to the damage you took. Alternatively, you can use an action to plant the tooth in the ground, causing a bush with sweets to grow over the course of 5 minutes. The bush has 5 pieces of candy, and each piece of candy heals 1d8 HP when eaten, but also causes you to take 1d4 damage due to your sore gums. The damage you take from the candy is is rolled after the healing you receive. The candy cannot nourish a target to prevent exhaustion. The tooth used for the spell regenerates after a long rest, and if wasnt used before the long rest, the magical tooth disappears. The damage increases by 1d10 and the amount of sweets grown increases by 5 for every spell level above 2nd. Original Spell: rope trick (2), Leos tiny hut (3) Reason for replacement: flavor, condensing, and the potential for some sick combos Replacement: wonderland (2) Wonderland: Illusion 1 action 1 hour 60 feet VSM (cotton shaped like a rabbit's tail) You create a peaceful room within your mind, and then cause a burrow to appear within 60 feet of you. The burrow can hold as many as eight medium or smaller creature, and once inside, the burrow's door can be closed, making the burrow disappear from view on the outside. Attacks and spells can't cross the entrance of the space, but those inside can see out of it through the entrance of the burrow through a one way-window on the door. Inside the burrow is a room that is decorated with anything from the image you created when you envisioned it, but anything that is attempted to be taken out of the space will vanish as they are just a figmentation of your imagination. Any psychic damage you take inside this space will cause it to warp into a nightmarish plane, causing everyone to take 2d10 psychic damage every minute while inside, unless they have resistence to the psychic damage or are immune to being frightened. Any attempts to open the door by anyone except you or a target you designate requires a succesful Arcana check equal to your spell DC. Anyone who entered the plane is forced out when the spell ends, along with anything they brought inside. If cast with a 3rd level spell or higher, you can make the burrow last 8 hours. If cast with a 5th level of higher spell slot, the burrow lasts up to 24 hours. Original Spell: Find Vehicle (2), Tiny Servant (3) Reason: flavor, condensing spell slots, potential for creative uses Replacement: Enhance Toy (3) Enhance Toy: Transmutation 1 Action 8 hours 60 feet VSM (a toy or trinket) You target a Small or Tiny Tou you see within 60 feet and you use your powers to manipulate it to become a life sized creature that resembles the toy. It shares the same AC as you and has hitpoints equal to half your maximum upon casting. If it takes damage that would reduce it below 0, it reverts back to a toy. The creature can be infused with a sentient fey spirit, or it can be an inanimate object. The spirit shares your alignment and will follow your orders to the best of its ability depending on how well you treat it. Several uses include turning a toy car or boat into a real vehicle, turning a dollhouse into a portable house, or making a doll or figurine come to life. You can work with your GM on the effects and limitations this spell has. If cast with a 5th level spell slot, the effect lasts for up to a day and its AC is your AC+3 and its hitpoints equal your hitpoint maximum. If cast with a 7th level or higher spell slot, it lasts for a week and its AC is yours +6 and its hit point maximum is double yours. If cast with a 9th level spell slot, it lasts a month and its AC is yours +10, and its hit points maximum is triple yours. Original Spell: minute meteors (3), healing spirit (2) Reason: flavor and more utility Replacement: shooting stars (3) Shooting Stars: 1 action Conc., up to 10 minutes Self VSM (a pearl worth 50gp or more) Six shooting stars orbit around you for the spells duration. When you cast the spell, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can hurl up to two of the stars to points you choose within 120 feet. It explodes if it reaches the point or hits a solid surface. Each hostile creature within 5 feet of the explosion must make a Dexterity save. The explosion deals 1d8 radiant damage on a failure, or half damage on a success. If the explosion hits a friendly target, the target heals 1d6 hitpoints. At Higher Levels: The number of stars created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd. Original Spell: phantasmal killer (4) Reason for replacement: out of character, more support as this player likes helping teammates Replacement: paradise portrait (4) Paradise Portrait: Illusion 60 feet 1 action Instant SM - a paintbrush You tap into a willing allys mind to paint a picture of serenity and calmness, which eases to stress of battle, granting 4d10 temporary hitpoints. Alternatively, you can tap into the mind of a hostile creature and paint a painful thought which forces an intellect saving throw of it deals 4d10 psychic damage. Lastly, we have a guardian of Justice, a chaotic good vigilante who goes by his own code of morality. He is meant to protect those who cant protect themselves, and to eradicate evil. For him I created new spells to increase the flavor of the class as some of the other options were just meh and were placeholders. Original Spell: healing spirit (2) Reason for replacement: healing spirit was either too op out of combat or a nuisance to track in combat Replacement: protect the wounded (2) Protect the Wounded Self 1 hour VSM - some gauze If a target is missing more than half its hitpoints, you can make a promise to help them, which allows you to carry them as if they were one size class smaller. Additionally, if the target is at 0 hitpoints, you also can carry them as if you were one size class larger. Additionally, any damage the target receives while in your arms is redirected to you. Original Spell: Misty step (2) Reason for replacement: making its use what I intended instead of how misty step is Replacement: martyrdom (2) Martyrdom Reaction Instant Self S When you see a target being attacked by a hostile opponent, you can use a reaction to be granted an immediate 60 feet of movement that you can use to teleport up to an open space within 5 feet of your targets location. If you have more than 5 feet of movement left, you can expend it to move your ally up to the remaining distance. If this causes the target to move out of the aggressors attack range, the aggressor must attack you instead, and their attack is made with advantage. If theres no open space available, the spell fails. At higher levels, you get 30 feet of movement speed per every level above second. Original Spell: glyph of warding (3) Reason for replacing: glyph seemed more of a creation thing Replacement. Grant amnesty (3) Grant Amnesty Enchantment Touch 1 minute Until Dispelled V You touch a willing target, who must have committed a crime that caused them to be imprisoned or have the legal force of the plane they committed a crime searching for them. You promise you will protect them from the law using your powers, in exchange for them to make an oath they must keep. After being forgiven, the target gains advantage on any checks it has to hide from opponents that are hunting it to bring them to their terms justice opposed to yours. In addition, your target is protected from Divination magic and the DC of survival checks to track it are increased by 10. If your target commits any act that breaks the promise that was made when the spell was cast, they gain Disadvantage to all Stealth checks, cannot benefit from protection to divination magic, and the DC of survival checks to track it are reduced by 10 until they are caught or the spell is removed via Greater Restoration or Wish. Original Spell: remove curse (3) Reason for replacement: needs more damage options. Replacement: Fist of Justice (3) Fist of Justice Enchantment Bonus action 1 round Self You make a weapon or ranged attack, and it deals 1d4 radiant damage for every point of your wisdom modifier. This attack has advantage on fiends and undead. If used with a bludgeoning weapon, it can break a curse on an object, or remove an owners attunement if its a cursed magical object. If used with a claw weapon, it can be used to reach into a targets soul and break a charmed or frightened condition they are affected by, and if it successfully removes a condition, it can be willed to heal the target the damage it would have done. The damage dice increases to 1d6 if used with a 4th level spell slot, and a 1d8 if used with a 5th level spell slot. Original Spell: death ward (4) Reason for replacement: roleplaying and gameplay Replacement: oath of honor (4) Oath of Honor Range: Self Components: V Duration: concentration, up to 1 hour. You enhance yourself with divine power, making your Charisma Score equal to your Wisdom. If your Charisma is higher than your Wisdom, it instead increases by your Wisdom modifier. While you are in under this spells effect, you cannot tell a lie, and everyone knows you are speaking the truth. You can, however, twist your words to try and deceive your opponents, but this only works as long as your words have honest intent. Original Spell: resilient sphere Reason for replacement: didnt like flavor, needed a 4th level damage option Replacement: ring of deterrence (4) Ring of Deterrence 120 feet VSM (a platinum ring worth at least 500GP) Concentration, up to 1 minute You create an invisible ring of radiant energy on a solid surface. The ring is up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is invisible to all hostile foes, but sheds a dim magical light to your allies. If a creature that cant see the ring attacks a creature within its radius, they must make a Wisdom saving throw. The target receives 5d8 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. Any creature that succeeds the throw can see the ring. In addition, all creatures within the radius benefit from half cover from all creatures outside it. At Higher Levels: The damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th. "

107,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,Iron Golem variant,1,8ya8qr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/8ya8qr/iron_golem_variant/,2018-07-13 00:28:21,"I was reading up on golems and had an idea for a variant rule on iron golems. Haven't put a heap of thought into it and I've never created or changed a monster before, so any and all input would be greatly appreciated! **Variant Rule** Once per round while the iron golem has no use of its breath weapon, the iron golem has immunity to all elemental damage. The first attack that hits the golem and deals elemental damage is absorbed by the golem. The golem is now immune to that damage type (replacing immunity to fire). In addition to this, the golem's breath weapon is recharged and changes damage type to match the immunity. Recharging the breath weapon on a roll (Recharge 6) recharges the damage type most recently used. I feel like immunity to all damage types, even for one attack, is a bit unbalanced. Perhaps removing the fire absorption trait fixes this balance. Or maybe it should gain a vulnerability to one damage type depending on the type of breath weapon, similar to how the pokemon Kecleon operates. This would add in a fun puzzle-like element to the fight, as your players figure out this pairing and slam a fire-immune golem with cold attacks, for example."
108,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,[5e] Custom weapons and a racial trait,0,8k9vjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/8k9vjd/5e_custom_weapons_and_a_racial_trait/,2018-05-18 12:35:18,"I'm trying to make some custom weapon effects and I need help balancing a racial trait. The complete race can be found here. URL Salt Weapons- Halite weapons automatically deposit small amounts of salt in any wound they leave. The result, is a painful cut that draws the focus from all but the most hardy of men. Halitess are immune to this effect, having grown up around sharp salt. Creatures that are immune to the poisoned condition are immune as well. After an attack with a salt weapon hits, flip a coin. If it lands on heads, the target has disadvantage on their next roll. Otherwise, nothing happens. When another creature would hit you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to take half damage.

109,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,Cantrips (5e),13,8lgeol,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/8lgeol/cantrips_5e/,2018-05-23 13:57:25,"So after u/HerziQuerzi and u/yolo_zombie 's posts I've got cantrips on the brain, so i thought I'd embrace the zeitgeist and brew a few myself. seeking feedback on the first pass **Fortify Object** Abjuration cantrip Casting Time 1 action Duration Concentration, up to 1 minute Range 30 feet Components V S M (an iron nail) Choose an object within range no bigger than an average door. That object gains resistance to damage for the duration of the spell - I know players are more often the ones trying to break something than they are trying to stop something being broken, so maybe in actual play this isnt useful enough to be picked. OTOH Ive recently had a lot of orcs battering doors, mooring lines slashed, etc of late, and some kind of item defense spell wouldve been nice. Maybe I should try to make it a 1st level spell, they are often less valued than cantrips. **Conjure Component** Conjuration cantrip Casting Time 1 action Duration 1 round Range self Components V S The material components of a spell you currently have prepared appear in your hands until the end of your next turn. This spell automatically fails if you attempt to conjure material components worth more than 5 gp. - this cantrip is a backup for having your component pouch/arcane focus stolen from you. I suppose you could choose to rely on it and run around without a component pouch, but youd be pushing all your spells to two actions to cast, which is a pretty steep charge when you could just use the item. But as a safety net for the times when your stuff is taken? Totally worth it. **Window** Divination cantrip Casting Time 1 action Duration 1 round Range touch Components V S Touch a solid object no more than 5 inches thick. Until the end of your next turn anyone looking at the object in a 1 circle around the spot where you touched can see what is on the other side of the object, as if it wasnt there. **Sit!** Enchantment cantrip Casting Time 1 action Duration instantaneous Range 30 ft Components V S The target must make a wisdom saving throw or immediately become prone. The target is immune to this effect if dropping prone would cause it direct harm (such as if it was flying) - alone this doesnt seem problematic, but it might combine with other effects poorly? **Hearth** Evocation cantrip Casting Time 1 action Duration 1 hour Range touch Components V M (A lump of charcoal) You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds heat like a small campfire warming things within 5 feet. Creatures travelling in areas of Extreme cold (DMG pg 110) automatically succeed on their saving throw to resist exhaustion if they spend the majority of each hour within the heat range of this spell. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action. If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell. - I was going to just give advantage on the cold save, but if good coats give full immunity I figure a cantrip can too. **Lesser Stink Bomb** Illusion cantrip Casting Time 1 action Duration 1 minute Range 30 feet Components V S M ( a hair from a skunk) This spell creates a foul smell in a 10ft radius area. Any ability checks based around the sense of smell (such as perception checks to track by scent) are made with disadvantage in this area for the duration of the spell. -we dont have much in the way of smell illusions in game yet. Seemed good to start small. **Shadows Grip** Necromancy cantrip Casting Time 1 action Duration 1 round Range 30 feet Components V S Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit the target takes 2d4 damage and has disadvantage to Strength saving throws until the end of your next turn. - Dex would probably be more useful, but Str seemed more thematic. Normally you throw save effects at guys with good ACs and attacks at guys with good saves. The game has plenty of save effects to increase your chance to overcome his AC, but fewer attack effects to increase your chance to overcome his save. Seemed like a good spot for a cantrip **Embrittlement** Transmutation cantrip Casting Time 1 action Duration Concentration, up to 1 minute Range touch Components V M (A cracked cup) You touch one object that is no bigger than an average door. Until the spell ends, the object has vulnerability to one type of damage chosen when the spell is cast. If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell. - Makes breaking open a locked chest or kicking in a door much easier. Or prepping before you use a firebolt to destroy evidence I guess. "

Bonus: let me know how youd use this spell ##**Glass Duplicate** *3rd-Level Conjuration* Casting Time: 1 action Range: 10ft Components: V, S, M (a broken mirror) Duration: concentration up to 1 hour In an empty space within 10ft of you conjure a glass duplicate. The duplicate is an exact copy of you or an ally within range, complete with equipment. Duplicates made have the following exceptions. - it counts as a construct - it cannot speak or cast spells - Any magical items are non-magical - It has a Constitution score equal to your spell casting ability modifier. - It has 1 hitpoint and vulnerability to all damage other than poison which it is immune to. - It is immune to the Charmed, Frightened, Surprised and Poisoned conditions. - It cannot take reactions or bonus actions. It takes initiative immediately after your turn, and you may command it telepathically on each of its turns. When it is reduced to 0 hitpoints it shatters and all equipment it was conjured with is destroyed. When you cast this spell at 5th level or higher the duplicate may take reactions and bonus actions. In addition they have hitpoints, Strength and Constitution scores equal to your spell attack modifier. When you cast this spell at 7th level or higher you may conjure two duplicates instead. If you do so, they act on the same initiative. If you choose to create two duplicates, they may each be of different creatures. If you cast this spell at 9th level, the duplicates gain the ability to speak and cast spells. If you duplicate a spellcaster this way, they are created with the exact amount of spell slots as the spellcaster upon casting this spell, though they are unable to cast spells of 8th level or higher.

But I think I may have something for you...""* *He disappears from sight and the cart shakes a bit before he returns with a small sack of tinkling items. ""Mercantile bylaws say I have to warn you about how these items are cough\(*lightlycursed*\)cough and/or cough\(*defective*\)cough, but I think we can make a deal if you're interested...""* \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Basically I'm looking to make items that spice up combat at lower levels \(3\-6\), either by making a larger risk/reward variant compared to your average item or having a cost associated with the item's benefit. I want them to generally favor the user, but not overwhelmingly so. And I like the flavor that these are broken or knock\-off magical items, which is why they are generally less\-reliable than their normal, magical counterparts. Here are some examples: **Diviner's Scryglass**: A short, periscopic spyglass with a cracked lens. Once per day, the user may call upon it as a free action to make a DC10 WIS check. On a successful check, the user's next action or check has advantage; if unsuccessful, it has disadvantage. **Enigmatic Flask**: A small metallic flask, unremarkable at a glance. Once per day, user may drink from the flask and roll 1d4. If the result is even, the user heals 2d4 \+ 2 damage. If it is odd, the user takes 1d6 damage and must make a DC10 CON saving throw; on a failure, the user is poisoned. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- I'm also considering an elemental attuning fork that grants resistance to one damage type but vulnerability to another, though that seems hard to balance in a way that is satisfying. And really, I'm still tuning the hell out of all of these; it seems like a difficult balance to strike, though it could lead to some fun situations. I'm also considering the idea of the party being able to pass these items off to their arcanist friend who can fix or correct the enchantments on one item between modules. Do you have any feedback for these items or ideas for more? What do you think they should cost? I'm also fine with silly items that have no real mechanical affect at all, and I think my party would, too."
112,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,More Necromancy Options For 5E,42,8pnlds,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/8pnlds/more_necromancy_options_for_5e/,2018-06-09 07:07:44,"Necromancers in 5e seem very limited to only animating humanoid creatures as undead. Not only that, but there are non\-humanoid undead in the *Monster Manuel*. So I decided to create a few more options for necromancers to play around with. # New Item **Potion of Vile Transformation** *Potion, rarity varies* When you drink this potion make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you take poison damage and are poisoned for 24 hours. If you succeed, you take half damage and you are not poisoned. You can choose to fail the saving throw, and if you do you take the maximum possible poison damage. If you are killed by the poison damage, or die violently while poisoned, you will transform into an undead creature predetermined by the potion. The potion's liquid is a cloudy green color and when exposed to air it turns into a milky white color. The potion's rarity, as well as the amount of poison damage dealt, is determined by |Undead's CR|Poison Damage|Rarity| |:-|:-|:-| |1/2 or less|1d6|Uncommon| |1 to 3|2d8|Rare| |4 to 7|3d10|Very Rare| |8 or higher|4d12|Legendary| **DM Notes:** Some undead require extra conditions in order to be created using this potion. For example, this potion can only turn a target into a Lich after the subject has created a phylactery. It is up to the DM to determine if such an undead has an extra condition, and what the consequences are for not meeting that condition before using this potion. Another note, if a player uses this potion to try and become more powerful, don't be afraid to take control of their character until they are changed back, *if they are changed back*. # New Spells The following are new spell options for wizards and clerics: ***Animate The Inhuman*** *5th\-level necromancy* **Casting Time:** 1 minute **Range:** 10 feet **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust) **Duration:** Instantaneous This spell grants an inhuman target with a false mimicry of life. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Large or smaller non\-humanoid within range. The target gains the skeleton template if you chose bones or the zombie template if you chose a corpse (Both templates are detailed at the end of this document.) The creature is hostile to all creatures, including you. Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turn. The creature pursues and attacks the nearest living creature to the best of its ability. ***Create Specter*** *5th\-level necromancy* **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 10 feet **Components:** V, S, M (a black onyx stone worth at least 150 gp) **Duration:** Instantaneous This spell condemnes a creature's soul to serve you even in death. Target the corpse of a humanoid within range that has been dead for no more then 1 minute and died violently. The target's spirit rises as a specter in the space of its corpse or in the nearest unoccupied space. On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command the specter you made with this spell if the specter is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple specters, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the specter will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general Command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. The specter is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain the control of the specter for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the specter again before the current 24\-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three specters you have created with this spell, rather than creating a new one. ***Command Shadows*** *4th\-level necromancy* **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 30 feet **Components:** V, S, M (a pintch of grave dust) **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute This spell commands a target's shadow to rise against its original master. Target one Medium or Small humanoid within range. The target must must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target's shadow animates becoming an undead creature (The DM has the shadow's game statistics). The shadow is hostile towards the target. Roll initiative for the shadow, which has its own turn. The shadow pursues and attacks the target creature to the best of its ability. If the spell ends, the shadow doesn't disappear if its target is dead. Instead, it acts in whatever manner it chooses until it is destroyed. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 6th level spell slot or higher, you can target one additional creature for every two spell slots above 4th level. ***Command The Lifeless*** *3rd\-level necromancy* **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, M (a black onyx stone worth at least 150 gp) **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute This spell attempts to bring an undead creature under your thrall. Target one undead creature within range. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw, and if it has an Intelligence of 12 or higher it automatically succeeds. On a failed save, the target becomes friendly to you and you control it for the duration. If it succeeds, you can't target the creature with this spell again for 24 hours. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you control with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same Command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. **At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 1 hour. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled. Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn't require Concentration. # Templates **Disclaimer.** The following templates were already found in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* on *page 282*. They are only listed here to make them more noticeable to the DMs that may have missed them. The following templates are meant to help DMs create interesting non\-humanoid zombies and skeletons for their players to encounter. Any ability score adjustments granted by these templates can not reduce a creature's score below 1, and it can not increase the score above 30. **Undead Nature.** These creatures do not require air, food, drink, or sleep. ***Skeleton*** just about any living creature with an internal skeleton can become a skeleton. When a creature becomes a skeleton, it retains all it's statistics except as noted below. **Ability Score Adjustments.** Increase the skeleton's Dexterity score by 2. Reduce the skeleton's Intelligence and Charisma scores by 4. **Alignment.** The skeleton's alignment becomes Lawful Evil. **Creature Type.** The skeleton's creature type becomes undead. **Senses.** Skeletons gains darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. **Immunities.** The skeleton gains immunities to poison damage and exhaustion, and it can not be poisoned. **Vulnerabilities.** The skeleton gains vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. **Languages.** Skeletons understands the languages they knew in life but they can't speak. ***Zombie*** just about any living creature can become a zombie. When a creature becomes a zombie, it retains all it's statistics except as noted below. **Ability Score Adjustments.** Increase the zombie's Strength score by 1, and its Constitution score by 2. Reduce the zombie's Intelligence score by 6, and its Wisdom and Charisma scores by 4. **Alignment.** The zombie's alignment becomes Neutral Evil. **Speed.** The zombie's speed is reduced by 10 feet, to a minimum of 5 feet. **Creature Type.** The zombie's creature type becomes undead. **Senses.** Zombies gains darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. **Immunities.** The zombie gains immunities to poison damage and exhaustion, and it can not be poisoned. **Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 \+ the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead. **Languages.** Zombies understands the languages they knew in life but they can't speak."
113,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,Monk Subclass Way of the Intercepting Fist V 1.4,4,8pq8qm,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/8pq8qm/monk_subclass_way_of_the_intercepting_fist_v_14/,2018-06-09 13:56:37,"*Lights candles.* Oh mighty subreddit. I bring you offerings of perfectly randomized dice and snacks. A while ago I decided to make my first homebrew for a Monk Subclass based on the principles of Jeet Kune Do and my personal martial arts training. I submitted it a couple of times to /r/UnearthedArcana, but and recived some pretty good feedback. However, I was told that I should post my progress here for more help. Let me know what y'all think! **Deflect Strikes \-** Beginning at 3rd level when choosing this tradition, your training has allowed you to develop the ability to read small cues and the intent of opponents, allowing you to potentially stop an attack before it even begins. You can use your reaction to deflect or stop a melee attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 \+ your Dexterity modifier \+ your monk level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you may spend 1 Ki point to immediately counterattack with an unarmed strike or melee monk weapon as part of the same reaction. If you have the Extra Attack feature from the monk or any other class, you may counter attack twice. **Fill the Teapot \-** At 3rd level, you become more fluid in your thinking and gain a new understanding of your opponents. This understanding allows you to learn things about your opponent and potentially discover their weaknesses. As a bonus action, you can select a target you are aware of that isnt incapacitated and make a Wisdom (Insight), contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If your Ki save DC is higher than your Insight roll, you may use that total instead. On a failure, you learn two aspects about the target of your choice: * Creature Type * Armor Class * Senses * A piece of its history or one of its personality traits, if it has any. * If its hit points are at or below one of these thresholds: 100&amp;#37;, 75&amp;#37;, 50&amp;#37;, or 25&amp;#37; of their hit point maximum. * Damage Vulnerabilities * Damage Resistances * Damage Immunities * Condition Immunities You know if the target succeeded or failed on their saving throw. Upon reaching 6th level, if the target fails their saving throw, you can choose three aspects to learn. This increases to four aspects at 11th level, and five aspects at 17th level. Alternatively you may use this feature without a check if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with the target outside of combat. **Flow like Water\-** Starting at 6th level, youve honed your awareness and reflexes through repetition and muscle memory. You can take a number of additional reactions each round equal to your Dexterity modifier (minimum of 1), at the cost of 1 ki point per reaction beyond the first. At 11th level, these reactions become second nature to you, and you no longer need to spend Ki points to use them. **Flowing Counter \-** Beginning at 11th level, your quick reflexes allow you to use a target's failure to your advantage. If a creature misses you with an attack, you can immediately use your reaction to perform one of the following: * Attack by Combination. You may make a melee or ranged attack against that target with advantage. If they are within melee range, you may use your Extra Attack feature with this ability. In addition, you may also spend a Ki point to trigger a Flurry of Blows. * Redirect Attack. You may cause the attack to hit one target of your choice, other than the attacker, that you are aware of within 5 feet of you. If the attack has the Reach property, you may select a target 10 ft away. * Immobilizing Attack. If the attacking creature is within melee range, you may attempt to Shove or Grapple them with advantage. * Progressive Indirect Attack. You may make a feint against the attacking creature, causing them to flinch. If you have an ally within attack range, their next attack is made with advantage against that target. * Attack by Drawing. You may attempt to goad the target into entering your range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Ki save DC. On a failed save, the target must use its next action to attack you with disadvantage. * Finger Jab. If the target is in melee range, they must make a Dexterity save or be blinded until your next turn. **Crashing Water Barrage \-** Upon reaching 17th level, youve fully embraced the ideals of your training and learn to overwhelm opponents like crashing water. Whenever you hit a single target with three or more attacks in one round, you can spend 3 ki points to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw against your Ki save DC. On a failure, the creature suffers one of the following effects for 1 minute or until they regain hit points in any way. * They have disadvantage on their attack rolls and saving throws. * They have vulnerability to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. * Their speed is reduced by half. This extends to all physical forms of movement. In addition, they must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw after using the Dash action. If they fail the save, they fall prone. * If they attempt an action in combat, they must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they lose their action and can't use reactions until the start of their next turn."

My vision was a fantasy astromech that was a sort of divine take on Warforged. Any notes on balance or flavor would be most welcome. Biblet Race Details: Biblets are the chosen of Oghma. Over the past two centuries books have been spontaneously awakening in libraries throughout Faerun. Some of the greatest minds in the world have attempted to replicate this phenomenon with little success. Biblet's believe the explanation lies not in the arcane, but in the divine. They believe that Oghma, god of knowledge, has chosen them to be his vessels on earth, burning away ignorance with fiery brand of knowledge and reason. Biblet Traits: Your biblet character has certain characteristics in common with all other biblets. Ability Score Increase: Your Intelligence score increases by 2. Your Constitution score increases by 1. Age: Biblets are awakened fully mature and do not appear to age. Alignment: Biblets are most often neutral. The accumulation and dissemination of knowledge leaves little time for the petty squabbles of good vs. evil. Oghma's chosen strive to share the joys of the written word with less literate races, but they recognize the immense power such knowledge can hold. They therefore tend towards more lawful behavior to protect potentially dangerous information from falling into the wrong hands. Size: Biblets are between 3 and 4 feet tall and average about 40 pounds. Your size is Small. Speed: Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Thick Spine: Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level. Banned Book: You have vulnerability to fire damage. Bibliophile: You have the ability to track information that is written down. You can spend 1 minute to scan a room for tomes or scrolls that reference a particular individual, location, or item. Oghmas Boon: You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. In addition you may cast * disguise self * and *tongues* once a day using intelligence as your spellcasting ability. Living Construct: Even though you were constructed, you are a living creature. You are immune to disease. You do not need to eat or breathe, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish. Instead of sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 4 hours each day. You do not dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal. Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and one language of your choice. "
117,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,5e The Elder Scrolls Races,10,8inch3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/8inch3/5e_the_elder_scrolls_races/,2018-05-11 22:28:43,"Hi, I am trying to develop the races of Tamriel into 5e. My campaign is going to be set during the events of TES III Morrowind with one of the player characters secretly being the Nerevarine and one of the others a Sixth House Sleeper Agent. Anyways, the crossover is not trying to conform to the rules of The Elder Scrolls so it will be a very D&amp;D flavored version of Tamriel. What I am working on is changing some of the current AL legal races into the ten races of Tamriel. My approach is relatively simple, I just want to take existing abilities and races and apply them to the templates of the Tamrielic races. My end goal is to create ten races that are powerful in their own right. Maybe they will be a bit imbalanced individually but I want anyone who is a fan of a particular race to look at their stats and go ""Wow that sure is flavorful and useful."" This is my initial draft that I wrote up in the last 12 hours and I am assuming after this post with some feedback I will be at a final version. My request is simple. For those of you familiar with TES lore do the races seem flavorful and useful? For those of you unfamiliar do the races seem balanced and powerful? For each ability I have the ability name, description, (with unchanged abilities from the base 5e race noted) and what race the ability comes from. (Race) **Argonian (Lizardmen of Volo)** For the most part the Lizardmen of 5e are fairly close to the Argonians. However, Argonians have shown an immunity to poison and ability to breathe underwater in most of the games. I removed some of the wordier abilities that I did not like and added the potent Argonian themed ones instead. Ability Score Increase: Constitution +2 and Wisdom +1 (Lizardmen) Swimming Speed: 30 feet (Lizardmen) Natural Armor: Same as base race. (Lizardmen) Bite Attack: Same as base race. (Lizardmen) Hunter's Lore: Same as base race. (Lizardmen) Languages: Cyrodilic and Jel. (Argonian) Amphibious: You can breathe air and water. (Triton) Histskin: You are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition. (Yuan Ti) Disease Resilience: Advantage on saves vs disease. (Argonian) Hold Breath: (Removed) Cunning Artisan: (Removed) Hungry Jaws: (Removed) **Khajiit (Tabaxi of Volo)** The Tabaxi are a perfect representation of the Khajiit. I did upgrade the Cat's Claws ability because I have not had any Tabaxi in my previous games use it and I added Eye of Fear because it fit with the ability of the same name Khajiit usually get in games. Of note Khajiit will technically be the only race with darkvision. Ability Score Increase: Dexterity +2 and Charisma +1 (Tabaxi) Night Eye: Darkvision 60 feet (Tabaxi) Feline Agility: Same as base race. (Tabaxi) Cat's Claws: Because of your claws, you have a climbing speed of 30 feet. In addition, your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. (Tabaxi) Cat's Talent: Same as base race. (Tabaxi) Languages: Cyrodilic, Ta'agra, and one extra language of your choice. (Khajiit) Eye of Fear: Proficiency in the Intimidation skill. (Half Orc) **Altmer (High Elf)** The Altmer get a plethora of magical abilities. I'm actually not sure if this race is balanced since it combines and modifies a lot of the magical abilities of various races. I replaced the general cantrip with the illusionist because Altmer have traditionally had a higher Illusion score. Maybe the vulnerability to a magic type is unnecessary. Ability Score Increase: Dexterity +2 and Intelligence +1 (High Elf) Keen Senses: Same as base race. (High Elf) Languages: Cyrodilic and Aldmeri(Elvish). (Altmer) Bonus Language: Same as base race. (High Elf) Elf Weapon Training: Proficiency in longsword, shortsword. (High Elf) Highborn: At 1st level, you gain the Dancing Lights cantrip. At 3rd level you can cast Faerie Fire once per long rest, and at 5th level you can cast Invisibility once per long rest. Intelligence is your spell casting ability. (Drow) Disease Resilience: Advantage on saves vs disease. (Altmer) Natural Illusionist: You know the Minor Illusion cantrip. Intelligence is your spell casting ability. (Gnome) Highborn: Vulnerable to one damage type of your choice from cold, fire, or lightning. (Altmer) Darkvision: (Removed) Fey Ancestry: (Removed) Trance: (Removed) Elf Weapon Training: (Removed) Cantrip: (Removed) **Dunmer (Tiefling)** This is also a fairly modified race but still mostly based on the Tiefling and variant abilities. I made their +2 to wisdom because my campaigns will almost always take place while the Tribunal is alive. I believe with the Daedra Worship, Plot of TES Morrowind, the Ashlanders, and the Tribunal that the Dunmer are the most likely to be Clerics or Druids in a D&amp;D version of Tamriel. Ability Score Increase: Intelligence +1 and Wisdom +2. (Dunmer) Ancestor's Resistance: Resistance to fire damage. (Tiefling) Languages: Cyrodilic, Dunmeri(Elvish), and Daedric(Infernal). (Dunmer) Ancestor's Wrath: You know Vicious Mockery (You N'wah). By 3rd level, you can cast Burning Hands as a 2nd-level spell, once per long rest. By 5th level, you can cast Unseen Servant once per short rest. Wisdom is your spell casting ability. (Tiefling) Keen Senses: Same as base race. (High Elf) Elf Weapon Training: Proficiency in shortsword, and longsword. (High Elf) Darkvision: (Removed) **Bosmer (Wood Elf)** Bosmer are a pretty easy convert from wood elves. Not sure if both Speech of Beast and Leaf and Beast Tongue should be on the list but they are both flavorfully on point. Ability Score Increase: Dexterity +2 and Wisdom +1 (Wood Elf) Keen Senses: Same as base race. (Wood Elf) Languages: Cyrodilic and Bosmeri(Elvish). (Bosmer) Elf Weapon Training: Proficiency in shortbow, and longbow. (Wood Elf) Fleet of Foot: Same as base race. (Wood Elf) Mask of the Wild: Same as base race. (Wood Elf) Speech of Beast and Leaf: You have the ability to communicate in a limited manner with beasts and plants. They can understand the meaning of your words, though you have no special ability to understand them in return. You have advantage on all Charisma checks you make to influence them. (Firbolg) Beast Tongue: You can cast Animal Friendship. Once you cast it, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell. (Yuan Ti) Disease Resilience: Advantage on saves vs disease. (Bosmer) Darkvision: (Removed) Fey Ancestry: (Removed) Trance: (Removed) **Orsimer (Half Orc)** Half Orc is a really strong race made even stronger by the addition of Orsimer's minor resistance to magic (Berserker Rage). Ability Score Increase: Strength +2 and Constitution +1 (Half Orc) Menacing: Same as base race. (Half Orc) Relentless Same as base race. (Half Orc) Savage Attacks: Same as base race. (Half Orc) Languages: Cyrodilic and Orc. (Orsimer) Berserker Rage: You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. (Halfling) Darkvision: (Removed) **Nord (Goliath of Volo)** Goliath sound a lot like Nords so I think this fits well. I of course added resist to cold and Battle Cry and Woad. Battle Cry I feel will be redundant anyways since most likely this will be a race a martial character chooses and Woad just seemed like what the Goliath needs to be competitive with the Orsimer and Redguard. Ability Score Improvements: Strength +2 and Constitution +1 (Goliath) Natural Athlete: Same as base race. (Goliath) Stone's Endurance: Same as base race. (Goliath) Mountain Born: You will not gain levels of exhaustion caused by cold climates. Resistance to cold damage. (Nord) Languages: Cyrodilic and Giant. (Nord) Battle Cry: You are proficient with two martial weapons of your choice and with light armor. (Hobgoblin) Woad: Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level. (Hill Dwarf) Powerful Build: (Removed) **Imperial (Half Elf)** Half Elf fits the theme of the Imperials perfectly. Remove some of the elven heritage abilities and give them some spell like abilities that match their long standing Voice of the Emperor ability. Ability Score Improvements: Charisma +2 and any other two ability scores +1. (Half Elf) Skill Versatility: Same as base race. (Half Elf) Languages: Cyrodilic and one extra language of your choice. (Half Elf) Voice of the Emperor: You know the Friends cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Charm Person spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. (Tiefling) Darkvision: (Removed) Fey Ancestry: (Removed) **Redguard (Mountain Dwarf)** Redguard are the most martial race because their society detest spellcasting. Fairly certain in Oblivion, Morrowind, and Skyrim there are barely any spellcasting Redguards. So I removed the con bonus in favor of dex to add a little variety to the martial races and gave the Redguard some flavor fitting abilities. Ability Score Increase: Dex +1 and Strength +2 (Redguard) Dwarven Resilience: Same as base race. (Dwarf) Dwarven Combat Training: Proficiency with 4 one handed simple or martial weapons of your choice. (Redguard) Languages: Cyrodilic and Yokudan. (Redguard) Dwarven Armor Training: Same as base race. (Dwarf) Adrenaline Rush: As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started. (Orc) Disease Resilience: Advantage on saves vs disease. (Redguard) Darkvision: (Removed) Tool Proficiency: (Removed) Stonecunning: (Removed) **Breton (Forest Gnome)** Dragonskin from the Yuan Ti race fits the Bretons perfectly as an upgraded ability of the Forest Gnomes. The cantrip from the High Elf might be just a little too good since I'm fairly certain having advantage on all spells saves is incredibly powerful. Ability Score Increase: Intelligence +2 and Dexterity +1 (Gnome) Dragonskin: You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. (Yuan Ti) Languages: Cyrodilic. (Breton) Artificer's Lore: Same as base race. (Gnome) Cantrip: Gain one wizard cantrip of your choice. Spellcasting ability is intelligence. (High Elf) Darkvision: (Removed) Gnome Cunning: (Removed) Natural Illusionist: (Removed)"

As for features and subclasses, this is where Id like help. So mechanically Im thinking something like this ##**Breath of Life** Beginning at first level you gain the ability to create and magically animate a golem in the likeness of a creature you have seen or read about with a CR up to to half your (Animator/Golemancer?) level provided you have the equivalent amount of wood or clay. Golems made this way lose their vulnerabilities, resistances, traits and any spellcasting abilities or attacks which deal damage other than piercing, slashing or bludgeoning damage. In addition they undergo theses other changes,  they no longer need to eat, drink or sleep  they obey any command issued by you (no action required)  they act on their own initiative  if made of wood they gain vulnerability to fire damage  if made of clay they gain vulnerability to force and thunder damage  they no longer heal  they can no longer speak Other than that they are an exact replica of the creature from which their form is derived. Aside from that I can think of two subclasses, one based on metalwork (allowing for animated swords and shields) and stone masonry If you have any comments or suggestions please share them ! If you think this should be a half caster, let me know! If youre gonna tell me to make an artificer subclass, please dont, its not my goal. "
120,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,[5e] Deck of Very Many Weird Things (full 54-card fun Deck),40,8565ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/8565ph/5e_deck_of_very_many_weird_things_full_54card_fun/,2018-03-18 06:44:54,"Hi, everyone! I'm planning on DMing my first campaign ever soon (5th Edition), and I decided I'd try to make something somewhat original. The idea is to have a sort of Deck of Many Things, but mostly built around the idea of Wild Magic from Sorcerer. I wanted to balance it as well as I could around having a low level party, so I wanted to avoid high damaging or super crazy long effects, in the hopes that the players won't be too scared of it to keep using it if they want. I'm still trying to figure out the order of the cards, and I'm open to suggestions to replace some, but I have a sort of order to it. The reason I don't quite consider it complete enough for r/UnearthedArcana right now is I want to get a few opinions on the order of which card does what, also maybe get some recommendations to add. * **CLUBS:** The ""weird stuff"" suit. This is where you'll find the bulk of the famous weird stuff that happens during Wild Magic. Things like turning blue, the potted plant, and so on. My personal favorite custom addition is the Queen. * **HEARTS:** Intended to be a sort of opposite to Clubs, Hearts is healing or ""fun happy stuff"", such as unicorns showing up, equipment turning pink, adding a racial feature, and docile beasts befriending you. I still could use a few more of these, since I have a couple of filler options at the moment. * **DIAMONDS:** The buffing suit. Basically everything in this suit is beneficial in some way, including giving advantage, two actions at once, and resistance. * **SPADES:** The spell casting suit. I haven't gone through ALL the spells, so feel free to recommend any that you think might be fun to have cast on yourself or in an area. I tweaked a few of the spells, such as ""badberry"" (makes you hungry) and ""safer confusion"" (acts like confusion, but doesn't cause you to hit each other), so if you can come up with any fun tweaks, let me know! * **JOKER:** I mean, I had to have the Astral Plane teleport happen somewhere. Anyways, here's what I currently have as my Deck of Very Many Weird Things. . ***DECK OF VERY MANY WEIRD THINGS:*** This deck is found in a small brass playing card box. Opening the box reveals a deck of pink playing cards with a strange drawing of a plant in a pot on the back. Trying to turn the cards over to see the face side reveals the same plant, with text that reads ""To reveal a card, you must draw it first"". [*DM: you'll want a standard set of 54 playing cards*] Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly . Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once. If the player chooses to draw a card, that card fades away, unless the card drawn is a Joker, which returns to the deck. If the deck reaches 20 cards left, all cards are shuffled back in. **CARDS** **JOKER:** Card | Result -----|------ Joker | You are transported to the Astral Plane until the end of your next turn, after which time you return to the space you previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. **CLUBS (Super Weird Stuff):** Card | Result -----|------ Ace | Your skin turns a vibrant shade of blue. A remove curse spell can end this effect. It will also slowly revert to its normal color over 6 hours. King | You turn into a potted plant until the start of your next turn. While a plant, you are incapacitated and have vulnerability to all damage. If you drop to 0 hit points, your pot breaks, and your form reverts. Queen | Each creature within your vision becomes invisible to you for the next minute, and you cannot hear them (you can still feel them). You are still visible to everyone else. Jack | Your hair falls out but grows back in 2 hours. 10 | Roll a d6. Your age changes by a number of years equal to the roll. If the roll is odd, you get younger (minimum 1 year old). If the roll is even, you get older. 9 | Roll a d6. Your height changes by a number of inches equal to the roll. If the roll is odd, you shrink. If the roll is even, you grow. 8 | You grow a long beard made of feathers that remains until you sneeze, at which point the feathers explode out from your face. 7 | You can't speak for the next minute. Whenever you try, pink bubbles float out of your mouth. 6 | You are surrounded by faint, ethereal music for the next minute. 5 | You glow with bright light in a 30-foot radius for the next minute. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you is blinded until the end of its next turn. 4 | Illusory butterflies and flower petals flutter int he air within 10 feet of you for the next minute. 3 | For the next minute, you must shout when you speak. 2 | For the next minute, any flammable solid/liquid object you touch that isn't being worn or carried by another creature bursts into flames. | For the next minute, any flammable solid/liquid object you touch that isn't being worn or carried by another creature bursts into flames. **HEARTS (Healing/""Happy Things""):** Card | Result -----|------ Ace | If you die within the next 24 hours, you immediately come back to life as if by the reincarnate spell. King | You gain a racial feature for the next 24 hours, and your appearance changes subtly to match the race you took from. If they already are that race, roll again. TABLE AT THE END. Queen | All of your equipment changes to a bright pink color for an hour. Jack | A unicorn controlled by the DM appears in a space within 5 feet of you, then disappears 1 minute later. 10 | You regain 2d10 hit points. 9 | You regain your lowest-level expended spell slot. 8 | You are immune to being intoxicated by alcohol for the next 24 hours. 7 | For the next minute, all docile beasts within 60 feet of you will flock to you as if they failed to save from an Animal Friendship spell (still requires Intelligence lower than 4). 6 | Your size increases by one size category for the next minute. 5 | For the next minute, you regain 5 hit points at the start of each of your turns. 4 | You are frightened by the nearest creature until the end of your next turn. 3 | 1d6 flumphs controlled by the DM appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are frightened of you. They vanish after 1 minute. 2 | You cast prestidigitation on every creature within 30 feet of you, which makes everyone clean. *KING OF HEARTS TABLE* Result (d8) | Race | Bonus Language | Racial Feature -----------|----|--------------|-------------- 1 | Dwarf | Dwarven | Dwarven Resistance 2 | Elf | Elvish | Fey Ancestry 3 | Halfling | Halfling | Brave 4 | Dragonborn | Draconic | Draconic Ancestry (just resistance, randomize or pick color) 5 | Gnome | Gnomish | Gnome Cunning 6 | Half-Orc | Orc | Relentless Endurance 7 | Tiefling | Infernal | Hellish Resistance 8 | Human | Extra Language (up to DM) | Nothing. [OPTIONAL: DM picks a feat for character, but only one part of a feat. No attribute bonuses permitted.] **DIAMONDS (Buffs):** Card | Result -----|------ Ace | For the next minute, all your spells with a casting time of 1 action have a casting time of 1 bonus action. King | You teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see. Queen | You can take two actions once in the next minute. Jack | For the next minute, you can teleport up to 20 feet as a bonus action on each of your turns. 10 | For the next minute, you can see any invisible creature if you have line of sight to it. 9 | Creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against the next spell you cast in the next minute that involves a saving throw. 8 | Maximize the damage of the next damaging spell you cast within the next minute. 7 | A spectral shield hovers near you for the next minute, granting you a +2 bonus to AC and immunity to magic missile. 6 | You gain resistance to all damage for the next minute. 5 | You gain inspiration, or a second inspiration if you already had inspiration. 4 | For the next minute, your movement is increased by 10 feet. 3 | For the next minute, any creature within 60 feet of you make no sound as they move (even if not in line of sight), giving advantage to stealth checks. 2 | An eye appears on your forehead for the next minute. During that time, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. **SPADES (Cast Spells):** Card | Result -----|------ Ace | You cast antimagic field (lasts 5 minutes). King | You cast comprehend languages. Queen | You cast mirror image. Jack | You cast Fly on a random creature within 60 feet of you. 10 | You cast polymorph on yourself. If you fail the saving throw, you turn into a sheep for 5 minutes. 9 | You cast safer confusion centered on yourself. However, this does not cause anyone to attack [7-8 act as 2-6]. 8 | You cast goodberry, except the berries fall to the ground. Also these goodberries are actually ""badberries"", which make you hungry, so you'll need to eat a ration in the next hour otherwise you become fatigued. Eating another badberry fills you enough that the hour countdown resets. 7 | You cast detect magic. 6 | You cast stinking cloud centered on yourself. 5 | You cast fog cloud centered on yourself. 4 | You cast levitate on yourself. 3 | You cast Grease centered on yourself. 2 | You cast magic missile as a 1st-level spell, but only one missile fires. If you don't have a specified target, the magic missile will attack randomly anyone within its range."
121,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,[5e] Rules for Cybernetics?,3,88l1du,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/88l1du/5e_rules_for_cybernetics/,2018-04-01 05:30:07,"Hello, hello. I apologize if this is gonna look a bit disorganized but here we goooo I'm going to run a 5e game in a cyberpunk-esque setting, and i'd like to include options for my players to ""enhancements"" for their characters. The idea is to provide options for getting more ""out-there"" abilities for characters without forcing a multiclass or anything. Any suggestions would be helpful, but here are the current rules I've included. **Cybernetic Enhancements** - A character can choose to obtain cybernetic enhancements through purchase or other means. - As tradeoff for when they receive an enhancement, they subtract 2 from a single ability score, 1 from two ability scores, or they lose a feat. &gt; this basically means it has about the same value as an ASI or a feat. Also represents trading in a vital part of your body (if STR DEX or CON), or your humanity (if INT, WIS or CHA) - A character can only have a maximum of 4 enhancements at a time. If they have more than 4, they lose bodily autonomy/control of their humanity and are effectively incapacitated until the number is brought down to 4. - If a character has 4 or more enhancements, they are considered a construct instead of a humanoid, and are thus no longer affected by humanoid-targeting spells. - If a character has 3 or more enhancements, they gain vulnerability to lightning or thunder damage (player choice). &gt; The enhancements should be pretty awesome (like scanner eyes that give unlimited *detect magic* and *identify*, a body rocket that provides limited flying speed, etc) so there's danger in having too many. - A character can have an enhancement permanently removed through purchase or some other means. - When removed, a character loses all benefits and effects added by the enhancement. - After removal, they can recover their spent ASI or Feat after completing a long rest. &gt; Aye so enhancements can be removed with some drawbacks. This is to force some hard decisions on the players to keep the tension up or something along those lines. Is there a way to streamline these rules, or should I should include these at all &amp; just stick to reflavoring? Thanks. "

The next time you take damage within the next minute, you have vulnerability to that instance of the damage. This damage cannot be reduced in any way, including by this ability. My main concern with this is that someone will get the damage immunity, then punch themselves/have someone else punch them to make the vulnerability not matter."

There are some spelling errors I know I need to go through, but I feel like there are balance changes I can make to this to bring it in line with some of the other traditions. Any feedback would be appreciated. -------------------------------------------------------------------- Description: Monks of the Iron Blood learn to forsake the pursuit of spiritual perfection, instead using their training for raw power and physical supremacy. An Iron Blood Monk does not utilize Ki, instead they harness their mystical energies to fuel dark concoctions and black arts, often at the cost of their own health. An Iron Blood Monk cares for proving their augmented strength against foes, and often act as Vagabonds, Mercenaries, and Enforcers in search of a worthy foe to test their battle prowess against. Iron Bloods focus on altering themselves to grow stronger at the cost of their body and souls set them apart from many, and are considered murderous fanatics by other Orders. Feel free to work with your GM, to reflavor aspects of this subclass in creating a Fallen Monk. Features: 3rd level: Iron Bloods Burden When you choose this option at level 3, you unlock the ability to augment your body with a ritual performed on a Long Rest. This ritual can involve different aspects, such as brewing and drinking a special mixture, using a special war paint and applying markings on your body, or awakening some unknown power from deep within to mutate yourself. This Ritual channels your Ki into special abilities, Each costing 2 Ki to activate and staying active until your next Long Rest. You can expend up to 2 additional Ki points to further improve these abilities. You can only have 1 ability active at a time, until you reach 11th level. +You take a -1 penalty to hit, but your attacks deal more damage, adding a +2 to damage rolls. This increases to a -2 to hit, and a +4 to damage, by spending additional ki. +When you take the Attack action, you can Choose to deal half the damage you roll on one of your attacks, instead healing yourself for half that amount. You can deal full damage but still heal half as much when you use additional ki. +Deal an additional 1d4 of necrotic damage to a target within 5 ft of you as a Bonus action. You can take 2 points of necrotic damage and use your Martial arts damage die instead with additional ki. This extra damage does not count as an attack. +When you Grapple a creature, you can cause the creature to make a Will save, or become Frightened of you for one round. This condition can be extended to 1 minute with additional ki, unless the creature succeeds its save. If you posses the Grappler feat, you impose disadvantage on this Will Save. +You can attempt to utilize a series of Pummeling strikes using all of your Power behind them, you make two unarmed strikes as a Bonus Action. You cannot use this again until you spend 1 turn taking no bonus action. You can use additional bonus actions with additional ki, so long as they are not attacks. Your body bears the mark of these burdens, with a Black Marking appearing on your arms and neck to signify your use of these burdens. 3rd Level: Agile Marauder You gain proficiency in Acrobatics, if you do not already possess it. You use Dexterity (Acrobatics) in place of Strength (Athletics) when performing a Grapple Check, and while grappling a creature of your size or smaller, your speed is no longer halved when moving the grappled creature. 6th Level: Hardened Mind and Soul At 6th level, you gain proficiency in two of the following skills, Insight (Wisdom), Investigation (Intelligence), or Intimidation (Charisma), as you are skilled in pressuring information from others through your observations or presence.

You can also deal 6 points of necrotic damage to yourself to Change 1 Burden for another as an Action. 17th Level: Iron Blooded Transmogrification At 17th level, your bodies constant exposure to your tainted blood causes it to surge with corrupted energies. As a Bonus action on your Turn, you can sacrifice all of your Ki (Minimum of 7), to awaken your Iron Bloods full potential. You gain the following benefits, +You gain the benefits of 4 Burdens at once, without having to expend damage. +You receive Temporary Hit Points equal to your Monk level, plus your Wisdom and Proficiency bonus. +You Gain an additional Attack whenever you use the Attack Action +Your Speed decreases by 10 ft, and your damage dice for Unarmed Strikes are increased to a 1d12 +You can use your Bonus Action to take 6 points of Necrotic Damage, you can gain resistance to Piercing, Bludgeoning, and Slashing damage.

This altered state comes with a price however, after 1 minute passes, you suffer 1d8 points of Necrotic Damage for each round you spend in this state. Additionally, you gain vulnerability to Cold and Fire damage, as these can cause your blood to harden or boil in your altered state. Once you exit this state, you suffer the poisoned condition until the end of a short or long rest.

This is my first time trying to make a class. This class makes your allies stronger and your enemies weaker. I'd love to hear if you think the features below are too strong or too weak for their class level. A couple notes: * This class is proficient with light armor. * This is a WIS-based class. Thanks! --- ## 1st Level ### Battle Meditation You must enter into battle meditation in order to use class abilities. While in battle meditation, your speed becomes 10 ft and add your proficiency bonus to your armor class. You cannot use shields while meditating. Battle meditation requires concentration and follows the rules for Concentration in the Players Handbook, except that you may make either Constitution or Wisdom saving throws to maintain your concentration. *[Note: this class is proficient with light armor.]* ### Improved Help When you take the Help action, you can apply the help to any creature within 30 feet, even if the creature your ally is attacking is farther than 5 feet away from you. ## 3rd Level ### Cursed Strike As an action, choose a hostile creature within 60 feet of you. You do not need to know the exact location of this creature. On the creatures next attack, subtract your proficiency bonus from the attack roll. ## 6th Level ### Blessed Strike As an action, choose a number of creatures up to your proficiency bonus other than yourself within 60 feet of you. You do not need to know the exact location of these creatures. Once within the next minute, the creatures may add your proficiency bonus to an attack roll. The creatures can wait until after they roll the d20 before deciding to use the Blessed Strike, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. ## 14th Level ### Circle of Orun At 14th level you can use your action create a magical glowing a circle 60 feet in diameter with you at its center that lasts for 3 rounds. Choose a number of creatures up to your proficiency bonus within the radius of the circle. While these creatures are within the Circle of Orun, they have advantage on Wisdom and intelligence saving throws. ## 18th Level ### Binding Opele At 18th level, you can project a spiritual chain of pure energy to bind your enemies. Choose a number of targets up to your proficiency bonus within 60 feet. The targets must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the targets become restrained for 1 minute and the targets gain vulnerability to force, psychic, and radiant damage."

I am not used to reading 3.5 jargon, so I decided to make my own weapon. It is fairly...okay heavily based off of Fenthras, from the Critical Role livestream. I'm hoping for some feedback. Too overpowered? Ways to fix that overpoweredness? Merthuval - Artifact (requires attunement by a fighting oriented non-evil aligned character) Dormant state: - The wielder gains +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. - When a creature is killed from a strike with weapon, tendrils of rose-vines rapidly grow out of their corpse over the next minute. In order to unlock awakened state: In combat with real foes, you must allow an enemy to strike you. That foe automatically scores a critical hit. Awakened State: - The bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to a +2. Additionally when the wielder hits with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an additional 1d4 force damage. - When you hit a target with this sword, the wielder can declare know the pain and can sense what the target is feeling emotionally, and a choice of knowing the vulnerability of a target or an invulnerability of the target. - When the wielder hits with an attack, they can declare earthen guidance. The target takes an additional 3d8 piercing damage, and they must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw or become restrained by the suddenly sprouting steel-hard thorn brambles that immediately grow from the wound the blade left. The restrained target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This ability cannot be used again until the wielder finishes a short or long rest. In order to obtain Exalted state: You must forge an alliance between two or more disparate groups, or change the alignment of a group, in order to unite them against a common foe, and you must work to protect them from that foe until the danger is past Exalted State: - The bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to a +3 - The force damage dealt by attacks with this weapon increases to 1d6 - The wielder can use the earthen guidance ability twice between rests, and the saving throw DC increases to 17 "
130,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,New Resistance Armour Option for 5e D&amp;D,8,76ysog,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/76ysog/new_resistance_armour_option_for_5e_dd/,2017-10-18 01:13:03,"In reality Armour should not effect ability to be hit by an opponent. Armour is the ability to protect against being hurt. **Some issues with Armour in D&amp;D:** 1. In D&amp;D Armour is ineffective against magical and area of effect damage (fire, Ice etc) and also falling, bludgeoning, trap damage etc. 2. Armour is useless if the AC is beaten on an attack roll or if attacked by magic. The only reason to actually have armour is to increase your AC. **Armour Resistances &amp; Vulnerabilities** An idea to remedy this without adding too much complexity to the game is to give the armour resistance and vulnerabilities to certain types of damage. Resistance is half damage for the damage type after modifiers. Vulnerability is damage doubled for the damage type after modifiers. Optional Armour Exploits: An Exploit is damage plus a half damage (Damage x 1.5), after modifiers. **Some examples (work in progress) :** Plate Mail - Resistance to: Bludgeoning, Slashing, Force, Fire, Acid. Vulnerable to: Electrical, Thunder. Exploit: Piercing. ChainMail - Resistance to: Piercing, Slashing, Force, Fire. Vulnerable to: Electrical, Acid. Exploit: Bludgeoning Hide - Resistance to: Bludgeoning, Slashing, Force, Cold, Acid. Vulnerable to: Necrotic, Fire. Exploit: Piercing. Studded Leather - Resistance to: Slashing, Force, Fire, Cold. Vulnerable to: Electrical, Necrotic, Acid. Exploit: Bludgeoning Leather - Resistance to: Force, Fire, Cold. Vulnerable to: Necrotic, Acid. Exploit: Piercing. Padded - Resistance to: Bludgeoning, Cold, Force Vulnerable to: Necrotic, Acid, Fire. Exploit: Slashing. (In writing this table I have tried to balance things out, it is not complete by any means, it is just an example of how this could work..) As you can see, this makes armour and armour types, really important in game! No longer are you just wearing armour to up your AC, but It becomes not only essential, but a tactical decision as to which type of armour you equip, depending on the environment you are in/ foe you are facing. It also means that no longer will players have the one trusty weapon, they will need other weapons depending on the armour of the foes they are facing. Much more tactical and exciting! Armour class is so intrinsic in D&amp;D that it cannot be altered without a complete rewrite of the mechanics. With this Armour Option AC will still work as it always has, and armour still lessens the chance to be hit. However, this armour option, allows for Armour to be become much more significant, along with the need to wield more that one type of weapon dealing a different damage type. Not only should armour protect from attack but also from area effect damage, and certain types of magical damage depending on the resistances of the armour. It also means certain types of armour could be a liability in some situations, keeping an edge to encounters e.g. Having metal armour when confronted by a lightning Mage! It also allows for true tanks in game, depending on the foes being faced. It also requires an amount of tactics on the players part. e.g. The plate clad Paladin will no longer charge into the cave of Kolbolts, in case they are all armed with piercing spears or crossbows! **Armour Points - Wear and Tear (an option).** The armour you have should not last forever. One way of dealing with this is Armour Points (AP). AP is simply twice the AC of the armour. Each time you receive a critical hit, or damage that your armour is vulnerable to, you lose an AP. If critical hit of a vulnerable damage type then 2 APs are lost. When your APs go below your AC of the armour, the AC also drops to the AP value, until the armour becomes useless, or is repaired. (Magical Armour could have its bonus as a multiplier. e.g. +1 plate adds another AC amount to the APs making them 3xAC) I haven't play-tested this yet, and it does add some complexity to encounters, but it also adds an interesting dynamic. its my First time on redit so I am interested in what people think.. Cheers, Sean"

I made this oath in an attempt to home brew it with my DM. I was hoping you guys could help check to see how fair it is and let me know what you think about it! 5.e Paladin Homebrew Oath: The Oath Of the Forge-burnt Hands This is a home brewed oath that can be taken by Paladins. The Oath of the Forge-burnt Hands is a oath taken by many blacksmiths and craftsman alike who have found a godly connection through their craftsmanship. Theyve developed strength and fortitude found only in the meticulous effort put into their details. The oath should be taken by one striving to create the best in whatever theyre making, and to keep themselves and those around him equipped as best as he can. In the same sense, the forge-burnt attempt to better themselves to help protect and be of use to those around them. Their favored weapons are those of or similar to their craft tools, and know how to use them. Constant danger of scrapes and burns from their trades have warranted improved healing abilities from their gods. The Forge-burnt strive to keep a balance between their offensive abilities, their strength, and their ability to help others. Tenants of the Forge-Burnt Hands Kindle the Worlds Forge. Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, actively beating back despair. Respect the Fire. Control over fire represents control over order and chaos. If unchecked, the flames can spread and destroy. When understood and tamed, it can create civilizations. Extinguish flames where they rage uncontrolled or burn too brightly. Bring fire to places of primitive cultures and teach them to harness it; light the darkness and bring warmth. Preserve Your Own Light. Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. Respect and admire all things well crafted. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you cant preserve it in the world. Be the Light. Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Spells 3 - Armor of Othrys (Teporary HP = 4+CHA, +1d6 damage to melee attacks), Ensnaring Strike 5 - Misty Step, Branding Smite 9 - Revivfy, Mass Healing Word 13 - Fire Shield, Guardian of Faith 17 - Flame Strike, Mass Cure Wounds Bonus Cantrip At third level when you take this Oath, you learn the Dancing Lights or Produce Flame cantrip if you don't already have it from another source. Channel Divinity When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options: Light of Dawn As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to your 4 x your paladin level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You cant use this feature on an undead or a construct. Quake Hammer As an action, you violently smash the weapon you are holding into the ground, using your Channel Divinity. Each creature within 10 feet must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + CHA mod bonuses + your proficiency) or be knocked prone. Holy fire burns from the ground (1d4+CHA) at the start of the turn, enemies standing on the consecrated area take damage again. Equipped Comfort Beginning at level 5, the paladin is comfortable in his armor and wielding his weapons and can maintain a well rested bonus while sleeping. Removing or applying armor takes half the normal amount of time. At 13th lvl: +1AC Aura of The Silver Shield Starting at 7th level, you will have an aura of silver light around you and any friendly creatures within a 10 feet range allowing you to add half your Charisma modifier rounded up to their total AC. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. Renew the Vow At 15th level, you become capable of using your Channel Divinity feature twice between rests intead of once. Also, whenever you use a healing spell, you treat the ammount of healing as if the spell was cast with a spell slot one level higher. Phoenix Knight At 20th level, you can assume the form of a great smoldering bird, emanating an aura of power and justice, a maelstrom of fire swirling around you. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute you gain the following benefits: Fiery wings appear on your back. You gain a fly speed of 60 feet, and you shed bright light in a 30 ft radius and dim light 30 ft beyond that. This light is sunlight. You and all allies within 30 feet of you are under the effects of a protection from evil and good spell. You emanate an aura of the Eternal Flame in a 30-foot radius. Aberrations, celestials, fey, fiends and undead in the aura have vulnerability to fire and radiant damage. When an enemy creature enters this radius for the first time, they must immediately make a Dexterity saving throw versus your spell save DC, taking 5d10 fire and 5d10 radiant damage on a failure and half that amount on a success. If a creature starts its turn in this radius, it must immediately repeat the saveIn addition, you and friendly creatures in the aura are immune to being frightened, charmed, or possessed by creatures of the aforementioned types. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

132,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,Abyssal Sorcerer Origin 5e,1,6wor4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/6wor4y/abyssal_sorcerer_origin_5e/,2017-08-29 13:49:39,"Hey guys I really missed the abyssal bloodline from 3.5 so I did my best to remake it for 5e keeping the flavor and trying to keep it at roughly the same power level of the draconic origin. Thanks for reading and tell me what you think! (I'm really unsure of the 18th level feature and would love suggestions). Abyssal Sorcerer Origin: Generations ago, a demon spread its filth into your heritage. While it does not manifest in all of your kin, for you it is particularly strong. You might sometimes have urges to chaos or evil, but your destiny (and alignment) is up to you. Abyssal Toughness: Your body has always seemed to shrug off blows others would succumb to. Ac 13 + dex mod. In addition you have fire and necrotic resistance but are vulnerable to radiant damage. Call of the Abyss: At the 6th level, as an action, you may conjure a demon(or demons), with a challenge rating of half your sorcerer level or lower. This costs 4 sorcery points to do so. A conjured demon appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 90 feet. They disappear to their home plane if they are reduced to 0 hit points. These fiends are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the fiend, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal(or telepathic) commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you dont issue any commands to the demon, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. You must finish a long rest to use this feature again. Demonic Flight: At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of demonic wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a Bonus Actionon Your Turn. They last until you dismiss them as a Bonus Action on Your Turn. You cant manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them. The Demon Within: At the 18th level you have the option to permanently fully embrace your abyssal heritage and your race changes to a fiend(demonic). Your appearence changes to that of the race of demon that infected your bloodline(Alternatively, at your dm's discretion, you transfrom to a demon of your choice or a form that is obivously demonic). You lose any ability scores, and any other weakness/strengths from your former race are lost (damage resistance etc..). You don't forget any languages however. You do gain the bonuses from your new race(pick 4 ability increases if you and your dm made a custom demon form). For example if a tiefling changes to a vrock, the tiefling loses his fire resistance and ability scores. His ability scores are now set to that of a vrock, has magic resistance and is immune to poison. If you do not embrace your heritage the gods smile upon you and remove your radiant vulnerability. Regardless of changing race you gain telepathy as a free action within 60 yards. Edit: Clarified Demon Within, nerfed Call of the Abyss. Call of the Abyss changes: Increased sorcery points from 3 to 4, removed extra uses. Demon Within changes: Added this line: For example a tiefling changes to a vrock, the tiefling loses his fire resistance and ability scores. His ability scores are now set to that of a vrock, has magic resistance and is immune to poison."

I am currently attempting to create a Gargoyle PC for a potential character in an upcoming campaign. A lot of the existing homebrew I've found for such a thing is not very balanced, so I am taking a stab at it myself using [the guidelines as seen here](URL EDIT: Made a few changes to try and clear things up and add in a little more flavour. Thanks for the suggestions! &gt; **Gargoyle** &gt; &gt; **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 2. &gt; &gt; **Age.** Gargoyles do not age and live as long as their stone form holds its shape. &gt; &gt; **Alignment.** Most Gargoyles are tend towards the alignment of those who created them. Often this results in a bend to Chaotic Evil, but there are cases of good Gargoyles created by benevolent Wizards. Those who escape the rule of their creators vary widely in alignment &gt; &gt; **Size.** Gargoyles widely vary in height, most often ranging between 4 and 7 feet fall, and averaging about 200 pounds. Your size is Medium &gt; &gt; **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 20 feet. &gt; &gt; **Languages.** You can speak, read and write Common and Terran. &gt; &gt; **Wings.** You have a flight speed of 30 feet. You must be in a space wide enough to accommodate your wingspan to fly (your wingspan is equal to twice your height). If you are wearing Medium or Heavy armor, you cannot fly. &gt; &gt; **Darkvision.** Due to your elemental nature, you have capable vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cant discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. &gt; &gt; **False Appearance.** When on land and standing still, you can use an action to attempt to pass yourself off as a statue. As long as you remain motionless, you are considered Stealthed with a roll equal to 8 + Proficiency + your Dexterity or Constitution modifier (your choice). A creature who sees you when you take this action, has Blindsense, has a higher Passive Perception, or makes a successful Wisdom (Perception) roll will know you are not a statue. &gt; &gt; **Living Stone.** You are immune to Poison damage, being Poisoned, and being Petrified. However, you are vulnerable to Acid damage. You do not need to eat or breathe, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish. Instead of sleeping, you enter an unconscious state for 4 hours a day to regenerate your form. In this form, you are considered paralyzed and can only be woken by taking damage or magical means. &gt; &gt; **Stones Endurance.** Your entire form is made of tough, durable stone. When you arent wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Constitution modifier. A shields benefits apply as normal. You can use this value to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower value. Using the point value system, I'm figuring it is somewhere between 5.5 ~ 6.5 points. The slow walking speed, one less attribute point, a vulnerability, and being paralyzed/hard to wake up during sleep all bring the score down quite a bit, even if the other things are all valued slightly higher than I'm putting them at. EDIT: I also decided to throw in a feat for good measure! Just a re-worded Dragonborn racial feat from UA, but it fit SO well that I had to put it here: &gt; &gt; Grotesque Figure &gt; &gt; Prerequisite: Gargoyle &gt; &gt; You tap into your elemental roots, accessing a primal strength. You gain the following benefits: &gt; &gt; * Increase your Constitution or Strength score by 1, up to a maximum of 20. &gt; &gt; * You cause your claws to expand and sharpen. Expanding or retracting the claws requires no action. The claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. &gt; &gt; * Your stone shape strengthens; you gain a +1 bonus to AC while you arent wearing armor. Any and all suggestions are welcome! If you got this far, thank you for reading! :)"

Came up with the concept of Slashing or Bludgeoning or Piercing resistance (only one for each armor, so if it has slashing resistance that's all it'll have). But I have a feeling that pushes the quality to much higher than Rare. Another idea I had was to make it give resistance to one kind of damage and vulnerability to another kind. Do you think that would counter it down to a low-Rare level? I'd also be open to other armor benefits that are on par with Adamantine/Mithral level (or slightly better)."

More like a ""fancier"" kerberos. One that might have different patterns or colours, maybe small horns, or being slightly larger or smaller then a purebred. My original idea for bringing this in to a dnd race is just swapping out the kerberos ability scores for the parent race. Is this a good way to go about it? **Experimental model:** This one I KNOW is a mess. I want to give them some kind of racial trait that has something to do with magic but I'm not sure just giving them a poison vulnerability is enough of a downside to resistance to magic. Maybe just resistance to certain kinds of magic? Alternate ideas were a weakness to all status effects (disadvantage to saving throws I guess?) or treating all magic that hits a kerberos pc as wild magic and having players roll for effects off the wild magic table.

Also, apologies for less than stellar formatting. It's copy/pasted from a word doc. ---------------------------------------- ---- **Lycanthropy (Wearbear)** *One of the most ancient and feared of all curses, passed through blood, this affliction can transform even the most civilised humanoid into a savage beast. In their natural humanoid form, a creature cursed by lycanthropy appears as its normal self, but over time they acquire features suggestive of their animal form. In that animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of a normal animal. On close inspection, its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and might glow red in the dark.* *Evil lycanthropes hide among normal folk, emerging in animal form at night to spread terror and bloodshed, especially under a full moon. But those than shun the curse are often reclusive and uncomfortable around other civilised creatures, spending their lives learning to control their wild, bestial urges. However, the power of a rising full moon makes the curse too strong to resist, and the host transforms into a terrifying animal-humanoid hybrid controlled by murderous impulse.* *Once cursed, the lycanthropic infection takes hold of the body, with the benefits and burdens becoming apparent almost immediately. However it takes even the strongest of lycanthropes time and training before they fully learn to unlock the full potential of their new abilities.* *There have been a small number of people who have sought out the lycanthropic curse. Where most who embrace this curse grow wicked, mad and even murderous, through intense training and discipline, they gain the advantages of enhanced physical prowess without losing themselves to the monsters inside. To some, it is a burden to bear, while to others it merely represents power that was previously beyond their reach.* --- Although the base traits of lycanthropy occur as soon as a person is infected, in order to the further levels count as Class levels and need to be chosen as a multi-class as a character levels up. **The Infection** AS SOON AS THEY ARE BITTEN A humanoid hit by an attack that carries the curse of lycanthropy must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + the lycanthropes proficiency bonus + the lycanthropes Constitution modifier) or become cursed. You can choose to automatically fail this saving throw. Immediately after becoming cursed, you are temporarily weakened while your body reacts to the change. You suffer a -2 penalty to all ability checks and saving throws, and healing magic only grants you half the expected hit points until you complete a long rest. **Level 0 (Straight after infection)** These traits appear in someone as soon as they awake from their first Long Rest after being infected. ALIGNMENT You must make a Wisdom Saving Throw or your alignment changes to that defined by the lycanthrope type. The base DC of this saving throw is 15. This lowers by 3 if either of your current alignment descriptors that are the same as the lycanthrope type. If your alignment is already the same, there is no need to make this saving throw. For example, a Lawful Good creature bitten by a Chaotic Evil lycanthrope would have a DC of 15; but a Chaotic Neutral creature would make the same saving throw with a DC of 12. The DM is free to decide that a change in alignment places the character under DM control until the curse of lycanthropy is removed. NATURAL ABILITIES You begin to adopt the improved abilities of the beast. Your Strength score increases to 19, unless it is already higher. You gain advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. SHAPECHANGER (Wearbear) You are able to harness the lycanthropic curse in your blood. As an action, you can polymorph into a bear-humanoid hybrid (size is Medium) or into a Brown Bear (size is Large). The transformation lasts up to 15 minutes and can be used up to twice per Long Rest. While in Beast form, you take on the statistics of the animal from the Monster Manual (Brown Bear p.319). While in your Hybrid form, you are able to keep wearing armour but are unable to speak or use equipment. In Beast form, you drop any equipment you are currently holding and anything you are wearing is merged into your new form  giving no effect until you leave the form. Your maximum and current hit point totals do not alter during the transformation. You can try to revert to your humanoid form early by using an action on your turn to roll a DC10 Wisdom Saving Throw. On a success you revert back to your normal form, but on a failure you remain as you are until the full length of the transformation is complete. You can only attempt this once per transformation. You automatically revert to your normal form if you fall unconscious, drop to 0hp, or die. At this stage, you are only able to transform to and from your humanoid form. You are not yet able to switch between Hybrid and Beast forms without reverting to humanoid. *While in Hybrid form:*  NATURAL ATTACKS When taking the Attack action, you can use the lycanthropes natural attacks (such as bite or claws), which deals the damage shown on the lycanthropes stat block. You do yet not add your proficiency bonus to these attack rolls.  RESILIANT HIDE You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage from non-silvered weapons. While you are not wearing heavy armour, you gain a +1 to your AC.  CURSED WEAKNESS You have vulnerability to damage from silvered weapons.  BLOODLUST When you start your turn in Hybrid form, you must make a Wisdom Saving Throw to maintrain control. The DC is 10 (or 15 if you are below half your max hp). On a failed save, you must move directly towards the nearest creature to you and use the Attack action against that creature. If there is more than one possible target, the DM chooses the target. Your turn immediately ends, and you regain control. If you are under an effect that prevents you from concentrating (such as the Barbarians Rage feature), you automatically fail this saving throw. MOONS CURSE The moon ignites the curse inside every lycanthrope. On the night of a full moon, you must make a DC15 Wisdom Saving Throw. Roll with disadvantage if you are outside. On a success, you transform into your hybrid form until the following dawn, but stay in control of your thoughts and actions. On a failed save, you transform into your hybrid form and become feral. The DM takes control of the character until the next dawn and you retain no memories of your actions. **Level 1** ADVANCED NATURAL ATTACKS You are now proficient in the lycanthropes natural attacks while in Hybrid form. FOCUSED BLOODLUST (replaces Bloodlust) At the start of your turn, you only make a Wisdom saving throw if you take any damage since the beginning of your last turn. The DC remains 10 (or 15 if you are below half your max hp). **Level 2** FERAL MIGHT You gain a bonus to melee damage rolls equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). You also have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in either of your Hybrid or Beast forms. SMOOTH TRANSITION You are now able to transform out of your transformation early as an action, without a saving throw. You are also able to transform between Hybrid and Beast forms without reverting to humanoid. This will count as one of your transformations. You are able to remain in each form for 15 minutes, but the clock restarts once you take a new form. **Level 3** ADVANCED TRANSFORMATION You can now stay transformed for 30 minutes. However if you spend longer than 15 minutes in your Hybrid form without transforming back to your normal humanoid form, you suffer one point of exhaustion. Additionally, you are now able to speak and use equipment while in your Hybrid form. STALKERS PROWESS Your speed increases by 10ft. You also can add 10ft to your long jump distance and 3ft to your high jump distance. **Level 4** ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you cant increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. IRON VOLITION Youve honed your willpower to better resist the violent urges of your lycanthropic curse. Whenever you make a Wisdom saving throw during combat to maintain control of your Hybrid form, you do so with advantage. In addition, when trying to remain in control during a full moon, you do so with advantage, or as normal if youre outside. **Level 5** TRANSFORMATION MASTERY You have wrestled with your inner predator and mastered it. You can now use your transformation feature three times between rests. You are able to remain transformed for a full 30 minutes without suffering any exhaustion. PACK HUNTER While in either of your transformed states, you have advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5ft of the creature and the ally isnt incapacitated.

141,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,Werewolf Monk Order,5,5w1jdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/5w1jdn/werewolf_monk_order/,2017-02-25 12:29:57,"So I've only been playing D&amp;D for about a year and a half but I've been DMing pretty much that whole time and I had this idea to introduce into my world of a monastery that was dedicated to focusing and utilizing the curse of Lycanthropy so you have basically a bunch of monks that can turn into hybrid animals. I looked at some of the stats for Lycanthropy in the Monster Manual and adapted Matt Mercer's frenzy aspect from the order of the Lycan Bloodhunter but the rest is made up. I've never actually played a monk or had one in my game so I'd really appreciate tips and especially advice on whether this seems balanced or not. Thanks! Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you channel your lycanthropic nature and gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. At 3rd level you have focused your training and willpower and gained some degree of control over a lycanthrope nature. Select one Lycanthropic form, by spending 3 ki you may use an action to transform into that chosen form. If you started as a monk at 1st level it is assumed that before this you were inflicted with the virus but through the specific training of your monastery you were able to channel your willpower into restraining the animalistic transformation, but you have now gained the ability to focus the bestial nature. Embracing the curse of lycanthropy in this way may cause minor physical altercations to your appearance such as additional hair or strange, animalistic eyes; your fingernails may grow long and pointed or if you chose the curse of the weretiger your hair may turn orange in places. You can spend 3 ki points to enter a hybrid form of your lycanthropic beast for up to 10 minutes or until you are knocked unconscious, alternatively, you may use an action to end your transformation early. In all forms in place of one of your attacks you may use a melee bite attack which you are considered proficient in. Your bite does 1 d8 + Strength Piercing damage but increases at subsequent levels. Your unarmed strikes may also deal slashing damage instead of bludgeoning in your lycanthropic form. In addition to these benefits you also gain additional benefits depending on your lycanthropic form. Frenzy of the Beast: While in your lycanthropic form at the beginning of each turn in a round wherein you took damage you must make a DC 10 (or DC 15 if youre below half health) Wis saving throw. On a failure you must use your action to make one melee attack against a random creature within 5 feet of you or move to the nearest creature to make that attack. After making this attack you regain control of your actions. Silver Vulnerability: In all hybrid forms you are considered vulnerable to silvered weapons. Werebear - While in this form you gain a strength score of 19 and a +1 bonus to AC unless your strength is already higher. All attacks become strength based and you are unable to use Dex based weapons while in this form. Due to your natural size and strength you gain proficiency in all athletics checks, if you are already proficient your proficiency bonus is doubled. Weretiger - While in this form you gain a strength score of 15 if your score isnt already higher and your movement speed increases by 5. You are able to make a Pounce Attack instead of your Bite Attack if you move at least 15 feet straight towards a creature and then hit with an unarmed strike on the same turn, the target takes 2d6 + Str slashing damage and must make a strength saving throw or be knocked prone. Wereboar - While in this form you gain a strength of 17 and instead of your Bite Attack you may make a charge attack with your tusks if you move at least 15 feet straight towards a creature and then hit with an unarmed strike on the same turn which does piercing damage equal to 2d6 + Str piercing damage on hit. The target must make a strength saving throw or be knocked up to 10 feet away from you. Wererat - While in this form you gain a Dexterity of 17 if your Dexterity score isnt higher and you gain advantage on Stealth rolls. You may also use Dexterity instead of Strength when using your bite attack. You also gain darkvision for 60 feet while in your rat form and can compress your body and move through spaces as though you were one size smaller than you are. Werewolf - While in this form you gain a strength of 15 if your strength score isnt higher and a + 1 bonus to AC. Due to your lupine nature you have a sense of pack tactics you gain advantage on attack rolls if an ally is within five feet of your target and is not incapacitated. 6th level: At 6th level you become more attuned to your bestial nature and can spend 2 ki to gain the benefits of any of the following spells: Jump, Longstrider, or Speak with Animals. Or you can spend 4 ki to cast Conjure Animals or Enhance Ability on Self. While in your lycanthropic hybrid form your bite attack now does 1d10 damage instead of 1d8, In addition the ability score granted by your lycanthropic form increases by one. 11th level: At 11th level In your Hybrid Form you gain resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage from non-magical, non-silvered weapons additionally, your bite attack does 1 d12 instead of 1d10 and you no longer suffer from Frenzy of the Beast. 17th level: At 17th level you have mastered your bestial form. The ability score and maximum score of your lycanthropic form increases by two. Your hybrid form has no time limit, and you can move in and out of it as a bonus action. When you enter your hybrid form you also gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom Modifier + half your monk level rounded down. Any thoughts and/or advice is greatly appreciated!"

143,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,Looking for feedback on a largely joke custom class that should be playable,6,5dudt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/5dudt7/looking_for_feedback_on_a_largely_joke_custom/,2016-11-20 07:33:16,"URL **Much more fleshed out and finalized version in the link above.** First off, my apologies if this is the wrong subreddit or if this isn't an appropriate topic for here. Long story short, a group of 5 of us (all brand new) have decided to play D&amp;D 5e and we have a 6th man who is on the fence but won't take the plunge. We talk about the game and our session constantly and have ""created"" a custom class in conversation for him known as the **Tokesmith**, basically an individual with lots of experience doing drugs who then uses that experience and knowledge in an herbalist/alchemist kind of way to manipulate the battlefield and what not. I've put in a bit of thought as far as making this a real class with actual starting stats/equipment, leveling up, maybe even subclasses that would be more geared toward the herbalism/cultivation of better drugs or the alchemy/extraction of stronger concentrates. I think that if I were to make the **Tokesmith** actually playable for him, he would join us. My main problem is that I am terribly new to the game and would love to be able to bounce some ideas off of others here or listen to any feedback or suggestions someone may have for something like this. I have looked at all of the herbalism and alchemy homebrews here and drawn heavily from them so far. URL The bones of what I have done, with plenty of other ideas just kind of floating around as I get more and more overwhelmed, thanks for looking. *EDIT* Forgot to mention a few things. Reagent Dice was meant to be sort of like Bardic Inspiration, potency would make the outcome better or no change. Additionally there would be a small list (8-10) of 'herbs' that could be foraged for and would be consumed as Major Reagents, with effects like healing/damage, advantage/disadvantage, resistance/vulnerability, various effects that could be paired up with positives and negatives."

146,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,"[5e] The Dealer (Homebrew Class, initial draft)",2,4zbhxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/4zbhxr/5e_the_dealer_homebrew_class_initial_draft/,2016-08-24 18:13:03,"Ever wanted to play card games while playing an RPG? No? Well, I don't blame you, but here you go anyway. This is a sort-of half-caster with two archetypes whose unique class abilities function off a standard pack of 54 playing cards. The actual card effects have yet to be assigned, but I've included some examples. I'm not even sure whether I'd play a class like this, but I wanted to see if I could do it. Odds are the numbers are completely out of whack for the level they're supposed to be at, but the overall concept appears fleshed out. The design philosophy here was to try and fold the powers limited to more than one per day into the card system, treating them like both spells and sorcery points at the same time. This minimises the variable to keep track of to a running count of cards (which there is a physical representation of) and a few yes/no questions, hopefully making it fairly simple to deal with despite the verbose rules. I'd imagine to get the most efficient play you'd have to create a custom set of cards with the effects printed on them to avoid looking up every single one. My reasoning is explained in the design remarks I left among the abilities. I'm sure it can be rewritten to be far more efficient with words once I'm done with the level by level breakdown. &amp;nbsp; ***** #Dealer The Dealer is a class touched by unpredictable magic, whether from the blessing of a trickster god or exposure to some ancient artefact of wild power. Some are sorcerers, never able to contain the magic in their blood. Others are skilled gamblers and charlatans granted a measure of power, known as the Talent among those circles. Sorcerers often use mainstays of their trade such as staves or wands, while mundanes gifted with the Talent tend to use dice or cards for their arcane foci. &amp;nbsp; **Hit Points** ~ *Hit Dice:* 1d8 per Dealer level ~ *Hit Points at 1st Level:* 8 + your Constitution modifier ~ *Hit Points at Higher Levels:* 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per Dealer level after 1st &amp;nbsp; **Proficiencies** ~ *Armor:* Light Armor ~ *Weapons:* Simple Weapons ~ *Tools:* Gaming Set (Player Choice) ~ *Saving Throws:* Dexterity, Charisma ~ *Skills:* Choose two skills from Acrobatics, Deception, Insight, Perception, Persuasion and Stealth &amp;nbsp; **Equipment:** You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment gained by your background: ~ **a)** studded leather armor or **b)** padded armor and a shortbow with 12 arrows ~ **a)** a quarterstaff and a dagger or **b)** 3 daggers ~ An explorer's pack also containing **a)** an ornate gaming set (As Proficiency) or **b)** a scholar's pack. &amp;nbsp; ***** #Cards You as the player use a standard deck of 54 playing cards. Most of these cards are assigned two effects: The Activation and the Raise. Activations can be used at level 1 as many times as you have cards, while Raises become available at later levels and are limited in their uses per long rest. A few cards have no Raise, they tend to scale better with level and may at later levels wind up more powerful than a Raise. At the end of every long rest, all cards are returned to the deck, which is shuffled, and a number of cards shown in the table below are drawn face down and placed in a pile. This is the playdeck, the source of the Dealer's power. At level 20, 26 (half the deck) cards are included in the playdeck. The remaining cards after the playdeck is drawn are known as the outer deck. When a card is discarded, it is placed aside in a discard pile and cannot be interacted with until the discard pile is shuffled back into the deck at the end of a long rest. If the session ends between long rests, take note of the number of cards in the playdeck, then shuffle and redraw them next session. Face up cards are not preserved. A few sample cards are as follows: &amp;nbsp; **4 of Hearts** *The Mighty Oak*: The target's AC is increased by +1 for every 3 caster levels (max 4) but its movement speed is halved. Wisdom negates. *Raise:* In addition to the above, the target gains resistance to piercing, slashing and bludgeoning damage and vulnerability to fire for the duration. &amp;nbsp; **2 of Hearts** *The Healing Hands*: The target gains the bonus/standard action ability to heal itself and others for 1d4+caster level/3 with a touch, usable a number of times equal to the caster's Charisma modifier. It suffers disadvantage on attack rolls until all charges are used. Wisdom negates. *Raise:* The target cannot use the Attack action at all until charges are spent. The heal amount increases to 1d8+caster level/2 per touch. &amp;nbsp; **6 of Spades** *Empathy*: The target's life essence becomes linked to the caster. Whenever either subject takes damage or is healed, the other is also affected for half the amount. Damage taken through the link is necrotic damage. *Raise:* Each subject takes the same amount of damage or healing given to the other. &amp;nbsp; **Queen of Spades** *The Horde*: (Caster Level / 2) dead remains up to 60' around the target immediately rise as neutral Zombies or Skeletons with 10HP and an AC of 14, starting with the closest to the target. They must be buried shallowly or out in the open and in good enough condition to fight in order to arise. They will each relentlessly attack the closest living entity before returning to lifelessness after (caster level) rounds. *Raise:* There is no limit to the number of creatures raised and the radius extends to 100'. &amp;nbsp; **1 of Clubs** *The Roaring Thunder*: A target within 30 feet is suddenly the center of a massive thunderclap. It and any entities in melee distance (10') around it must make a Dexterity saving throw or be deafened for 1d4 rounds. Additionally, the designated target takes Caster Level * d6 (max 10) thunder damage, which is halved on a successful save. This ability must be aimed at a living target of tiny size or larger; the caster must target themselves if no suitable target is in range. *Raise:* There is no maximum to the caster level and the damage die increases to d8. Deafening caused by this ability is permanent until cured with Lesser Restoration or similar condition removing effects. &amp;nbsp; **8 of Clubs** *The Berserker*: The target gains +1 to hit and damage at first level and an additional +1 for every 6 caster levels thereafter. The target takes disadvantage on the next 1+(Caster Level/6) Wisdom saving throws. *Raise*: The bonus to hit and damage increases by +2; disadvantage affects all saves and applies an additional -2. &amp;nbsp; ***** #Class Table Lvl|Prof.|PlDeck|Features :--|:--|:--|:-- 1|2|4|Cantrips, Draw 2|2|5|Deal, Sever Fate 3|2|7|Archetype (Destiny, Fortune) 4|2|7|Ability Score Improvement 5|3|10|Extra Attack, Two of a Kind 6|3|10|Flop 7|3|12|Archetype (2) 8|3|12|Ability Score Improvement 9|4|15|Raise 10|4|15|Archetype(2) 11|4|17|Turn 12|4|17|Ability Score Improvement 13|5|20|Three of a Kind 14|5|20|All-In 15|5|22|Archetype(3) 16|5|22|Ability Score Improvement 17|6|25|River 18|6|25|Archetype(4) 19|6|27|Ability Score Improvement 20|6|27|Stacked Deck &amp;nbsp; #Class Features By Level &amp;nbsp; **Level 1** ***** **Cantrips:** You begin play knowing any 3 of: Gust, Light, Prestidigitation, Friends, Message, Minor Illusion, Mending, Mage Hand. You may gain an additional cantrip at level 4 and every 4 levels thereafter. ~*Design Remark:* Most of these are more useful outside of combat; they're mostly there to provide something interesting to do when you're low on cards. By level 20 you can know all of them on your list, though you'll probably stop caring after level 8 or so. &amp;nbsp; **Draw:** As a standard action, you may draw one card from the playdeck. You must activate that card's power on the spot, whether it's useful, useless or dangerous. You may elect instead to take (caster level)d4 psychic damage and discard two cards from the top of the playdeck to avoid activating the drawn card. Using the Draw action to draw and activate a single card does not provoke an Attack of Opportunity. At later levels, multiple cards may be drawn from your playdeck and/or activated in one Draw action, which can provoke attacks of opportunity. Unless stated otherwise, the duration of non-instantaneous effects is equal to the caster's level; you may not end an effect early. ~*Design Remark:* This is the core identity of the Dealer. When it comes down to it, it's about drawing a card and hoping like hell it's something awesome. Drawing a single card doesn't provoke as the most likely user of a single card draw action is the martial-focused Destiny Dealer. If you're a Fortune Dealer drawing single cards in melee you're already doing it wrong. &amp;nbsp; **Level 2** ***** **Deal:** Once per long rest, at the end of a short rest, add twice your enhancement bonus in cards to your playdeck and shuffle it. Your playdeck cannot exceed its maximum size for your level. &amp;nbsp; **Sever Fate:** As a standard action, you may end an effect caused by one of your cards by discarding a number of them equal to half the duration remaining from the top of the playdeck. ~*Design Remark:* A simple feature designed to grant a bit of sticking power and limit nova potential. At level 20 it effectively makes two thirds of the cards in the deck available to you between long rests. Sever Fate was added because of the fear of getting stuck with an effect while things get out of hand. &amp;nbsp; **Level 3** ***** **Archetype:** #Destiny These characters accept their newfound powers and attempt to work under their rules. They are rewarded with the ability to (sometimes) pass the effects of their bad draws along to their enemies and use the deck a little more reliably. Destiny Dealers gain proficiency with medium armor and all martial weapons as well as in Sleight of Hand. &amp;nbsp; **Defy Destiny (1):** By discarding a number of cards equal to one third of your Dealer level from the top of your playdeck, you can attempt to redirect the backlash from not activating a card using the Draw feature to an adjacent target. The target must attempt a Wisdom saving throw vs. your spell DC or be subjected to 1d4 x Caster Level psychic damage and disadvantage on the next attack roll or skill check. You avoid the psychic damage entirely if successful, or take half damage if the target succeeds the saving throw. This ability can be used on an inanimate object or the ground to halve the backlash damage if no living target is nearby. &amp;nbsp; **Fate's Favored (1):** At the end of a short rest, you may draw up to two cards from the top of the playdeck and set them aside face up. A maximum of two cards can be put aside like this at one time. You can discard one of these cards as a bonus action any time you make an attack action to deal an additional1d6 damage per attack of a type corresponding to the suit of the card (Diamonds - Radiant, Clubs - Thunder, Spades - Necrotic, Hearts - Psychic). As part of the bonus action the you may attempt a DC 15 Sleight of Hand check to replace the used card from the playdeck. The cards put aside by this ability may not be used in a Draw action until they are shuffled back into the deck at the end of the next long rest. &amp;nbsp; #Fortune These characters embrace and exploit their unpredictable power, forever seeking means and opportunities to direct it to their own ends. They are rewarded with the ability to tweak their odds, making for more fortuitous draws in exchange for expending power more quickly. Fortune Dealers gain proficiency with shortswords as well as in Sleight of Hand and Arcana. &amp;nbsp; **Twist of Fate (1):** You may draw up to two additional cards using the Deal action, and select one from among them to activate. These additional cards count as part of the Draw for the purposes of Two, Three and Four of a Kind. The cards remaining after activating one or more must be discarded. Discarded cards that match the suit or rank of an activated card may add a bonus of +1 to either Save DC or Effective Caster Level to any one of the matching cards, up to a maximum of +3 each. If one or more cards is discarded without activation, a DC 15 Sleight of Hand check may be attempted to add one card from the outer deck to the top of your playdeck. &amp;nbsp; **Ace Up The Sleeve (1):** At the end of a long rest, you may draw a card from the outer deck and set it aside face up. Anytime you can normally use Draw, you may activate one of these cards as if you had drawn it as a single card Draw action. The card is then discarded as normal. Whether used or not this card is shuffled back into the deck at the end of the next long rest. ~*Design Remark:* Each archetype has a modification for the draw feature and a unique ""card holding"" ability. The Fortune path allows you to reduce your effective spell count in order to get the most useful possible effects per round and save random cards to be used at will. These cards come from the outer deck and are essentially bonus spell slots chosen at random. The Destiny path is more martial in nature, allowing the Dealer to pass on the results of a bad draw and enhance weapon attacks using cards. &amp;nbsp; **Level 4** ***** **Ability Score Improvement** &amp;nbsp; **Level 5** ***** **Extra Attack:** Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. &amp;nbsp; **Two of a Kind:** When you take the Draw action, you may choose to draw one additional card. If the suit or rank of any of the cards you draw match, you must activate two of the matching cards. Otherwise, you may activate either (or neither, for backlash). If you have a hand with multiple sets of two, you may choose one of the sets to activate. You can elect to take backlash damage on a matched set, but you must activate all or none and the backlash damage is doubled (to 2d4 x Caster Level). ~*Design Remark:* The extra attack is mostly useful to a Destiny Dealer, as his Fate's Favoured ability applies to all attacks made as part of the attack action, but may synergize with a card that enhances attacks as part of its effect even on the Fortune Dealer. Two of a Kind is situational for a Destiny Dealer at about a ~1/4 chance of a successful double-cast, but synergizes with the Fortune Dealer's Twist of Fate to make the Draw size a maximum of four and the odds of a double-cast much better. Of course, that may not always be a good thing, and the blowback damage from refusing the judgement of the cards is pretty brutal. &amp;nbsp; **Level 6** ***** **Flop:** Once per long rest, at the end of a short rest, pick up the top three cards on your playdeck and replace them in the same order face-up. You may observe them freely and Draw with them as you would face-down cards. This action can be taken after using Deal at the end of the same short rest. &amp;nbsp; **Favorable Odds:** You can add up to +2 to any skill check after the roll by discarding an equal number of cards from your playdeck; the maximum bonus increases to +3 at level 10 and +4 at level 14. &amp;nbsp; ~*Design Remark:* This ability adds a little extra foresight to the way Draw is used. The randomized order of the cards is a set-in-stone feature that is only marginally broken by the level 20 capstone ability, but the ability to see what's coming up adds a little method to the madness, especially with the risk (and reward) that Two of a Kind and its later variants bring to the table. &amp;nbsp; **Level 7** ***** **Archetype Feature** **Destiny - Fate's Favored (2):** You may now put aside three cards from your playdeck instead of two, and discard two as a bonus action to deal 1d6 per card for each attack. The type of the bonus damage corresponds to the suit of the card (Diamonds - Radiant, Clubs - Thunder, Spades - Necrotic, Hearts - Psychic). The Sleight of Hand check now replaces up to two cards from the playdeck, one for meeting the DC 15 and one for beating it by 5. &amp;nbsp; **Fortune - Ace Up The Sleeve (2):** You may now draw and put aside three cards instead of one. You can also choose one to pass to an ally, keeping the others. The ally may activate the provided card as a Use Item action with a power equal to half your caster level, but it becomes inert after a long rest and must be reshuffled. ~*Design Remark:* Nothing too fancy here. Fate's Favored increases the potential damage to 4d6/round (2d6 over 2 attacks) but can only be maintained for around 4-5 uses (the maximum playdeck count at this level is 12, so worst case scenario you get six rounds of this in one sitting plus a couple more from deal) before being stuck with 1, even with expertise from another class. Ace Up The Sleeve storage increases to three cards chosen at random for a little more flexibility and also allows you to hand out good buff cards as pseudo-""potions"". &amp;nbsp; **Level 8** ***** **Ability Score Improvement** &amp;nbsp; **Level 9** ***** **Raise:** When you use the Draw action, you may choose to Raise a card instead of activate it. To Raise you must announce your intent to Raise before commencing the Draw, then selecting one of the drawn cards to Raise. You must discard two further cards from the top of the playdeck after drawing to Raise. Failing to activate a Raise after a draw either due to not having enough cards or by choice results in Caster Level x d8 Psychic damage. This power will work with one of the matches of Two or Three of a Kind, but only if you declare your intent before drawing; you cannot decide to Raise once you see the results of the Draw. You may only Raise once per Draw action. *Design Remark:* This is where half casters get their third level spells. Raises are generally equivalent to level 3-5 spells, but scale more strictly with level. Using a Raise is slightly risky, especially for a Destiny dealer, but can be partially mitigated and even capitalized on using Flop. &amp;nbsp; **Level 10** ***** **Archetype Feature** **Destiny - Defy Destiny (2):** Using this ability now costs one quarter of your dealer level in cards. You may now also expend the same number of cards to attempt to redirect damage from failing a Raise, however: if the target succeeds their saving throw, you take full damage. Furthermore, you cannot redirect the damage to an inanimate object. When you use Defy Destiny to channel backlash energy from a matched set into a target, the damage die increases by one step (d4 to d6) and the target gains a level of fatigue in addition to disadvantage. Damage from Raise backlash is equal to 1d8 x caster level. &amp;nbsp; **Fortune - Twist of Fate (2):** You may now draw three additional cards instead of two. Succeeding the Sleight of Hand check by 5 or more now allows you to add two cards back to the playdeck from the outer deck instead of one, provided two or more cards are discarded without activation (cards paid as the cost of a Raise do not count for the purposes of this check). *Design Remark:* Expands the use of Defy Destiny to the recently obtained Raise (but not without risk), Twist of Fate can now help you burn more cards on boosting your odds and power (or get more cards back). A Fortune Dealer can draw five cards total with this power and get back up to two of them, making the full-power uses anywhere between 3-5 at maximum playdeck capacity. Alternatively, he may draw only three cards and possibly get back both for a net expenditure of one card. &amp;nbsp; **Level 11** ***** **Turn:** You may reveal the top card of your playdeck as a Move Action once. This ability resets after using Deal or taking a long rest. You may also view an additional card from the top of your playdeck when you use Flop, for a total of four. *Design Remark:* The niche strategic ability at level 6 has grown into a situationally combat-useful tool for peeking at your coming Destiny. It's also cool and thematic and stuff. &amp;nbsp; **Level 12** ***** **Ability Score Improvement** &amp;nbsp; **Level 13** ***** **Three of a Kind:** When you take the Draw action, you may choose to draw two additional cards instead of one. Additionally, if the suit or rank of any 3 cards you draw match, you must activate all three of the matching cards. If you have two or more sets of three, you may choose which set to activate. This ability has priority over Two of a Kind. You can elect to take backlash damage on a matched set, but you must activate all or none and the backlash damage is doubled (to 2d4 x Caster Level). ~*Design Remark:* This is the ability that replaces 4th level spells. Fortune Dealers now have a six card maximum Draw, though that's only really useful if you need to be very precise with what kind of Power you use, or you're fishing for a lucky double or triple-cast. At this level you can only Draw a full 6 card hand 3 times, or 4 with some lucky sleight of hand rolls. Destiny Dealers don't have much chance of a triple-cast, having a maximum hand of 3 (about a 1/16 chance), but the odds of a double-cast are within reason now. As designed, their overall potential is lower, but more consistent. &amp;nbsp; **Level 14** ***** **All-In:** As a full-round action, Draw two cards, then discard your whole playdeck. Expend a use of Raise for each card, targeting one against your choice of target and one against yourself. If the target takes damage or healing from one of the Raised cards, it takes an additional amount of damage or healing respectively equal to the number of discarded cards. You must then make a Charisma save with a DC equal to (30 - cards discarded). If you fail, you consume the next usage of Deal (either the one available now or the next one available after a long rest). You must activate both cards, and the drawn cards do not count towards cards discarded. You must have at least 3 cards in your playdeck to use this ability. *Design Remark:* I wanted an ability where you could throw the whole deck at someone. Saving it for the last battle of the day is at least mildly rewarding for a (risky) double-Raise. Ideally you get a damaging or debuff card and a buff or healing card, but you may find yourself electing to take the lesser of two evils. &amp;nbsp; **Level 15** ***** **Archetype Feature** **Destiny - Fate's Favored (3)** You may now put aside four cards from your outer deck instead of three, and discard up to three as a bonus action to deal 1d6 per card for each attack. The Sleight of Hand check replaces one card from the playdeck for every 5 over the DC 15, up to the maximum of four. &amp;nbsp; **Fortune - Ace Up The Sleeve (3):** You may now pass all three cards to allies if desired. Furthermore, you may now add one of these stored cards to a multiple-card Draw along with the ones from your playdeck. *Design Remark:* Fate's Favored is a major but not 100% reliable attack boost for a whopping semi-random-typed 6d6 total added to attack damage, capable of sustaining indefinitely if the character can consistently pass difficult Sleight of Hand checks, at least until their playdeck runs out (which at level 15 would be 8 rounds, 15 using Deal assuming the Dealer has not done any Draw actions). Ace up the Sleeve continues to add amounts of consistency to an inconsistent class and slightly improves the support ability. Adding the ability to add cards to the working hand allows the player to save good cards for high quality combinations, or rescue a poor Draw from an unwanted Two of a Kind. **Level 16** ***** **Ability Score Improvement** &amp;nbsp; **Level 17** ***** **River:** You may use Turn to reveal the top card of your playdeck as a Free action instead of a Move action.You may also view an additional card from the top of your playdeck when you use Flop, for a total of five. &amp;nbsp; **Level 18** ***** **Archetype Feature** **Fortune - Four of a Kind:** When you take the Draw action, you may choose to draw three additional cards. If the suit or rank of any of the cards you draw match with each other, you must activate the base power of two of the matching cards and Raise one. This Raise does not consume the usual 2 card cost. If you have two or more sets of four, you may choose which set to activate. This ability has priority over Three of a Kind. You can elect to take backlash damage on a matched set, but you must activate all or none and the backlash damage is doubled (to 2d4 x Caster Level). &amp;nbsp; **Destiny - Grandmaster's Deal:** As a move action, you may add your proficiency bonus in cards from your outer deck to your playdeck instead of taking twice your proficiency bonus in cards at the end of a short rest. You do not need to make a charisma check to keep this ability after an All-In, and can choose to take (and redirect) Raised backlash damage instead of Raising one of the cards while using All-In. ~*Design Remark:* The level 18 Archetype capstone was chosen to give each archetype their own version of power-casting. Four of a Kind is an improvement in that you only need to activate 3 of the 4 and get a free raise, meaning undesirable effects can be avoided and extra potential to access Raised spells. Grandmaster Deal encourages heavier use of the All-In feature, the only feature that allows double-casting Raises. The potential benefit per round is considerably higher than Four of a Kind, but can only be used twice between long rests, most optimally when the Dealer is low on resources. &amp;nbsp; **Level 19** ***** **Ability Score Improvement** &amp;nbsp; **Level 20** ***** **Stacked Deck:** As a full-round action you may take fourteen cards from the top of the playdeck and rearrange them as you please; discard the rest of the playdeck. You must have at least fourteen cards in your playdeck to use this ability. You cannot use Draw or otherwise add cards to your playdeck until the end of a long rest. ~*Design Remark:* This capstone is pretty much designed to synergize with the multi-casting ability to set up large comboes. Even the Destiny Dealer can stack the deck for more modest but plentiful combinations. &amp;nbsp; ***** **Discrete Feature Count** Level received and upgrades in parentheses: Cantrips (1 every 4th level) Draw (Two tiers of unique improvements for each archetype at 3 and 10) Deal (Grandmaster Deal for Destiny Archetype at 18) Sever Fate (2) Archetype Primary (Ace Up The Sleeve or Fate's Favored, three tiers at 3, 7 and 15) Extra Attack (5) Two of a Kind (three tiers at 5, 13 and 18; third tier is for Fortune Dealers only.) Flop (three tiers at 6, 11 and 17) Raise (9) All-In (14) Stacked Deck (20) "
147,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,The Sword Dragon,1,4r4dty,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/4r4dty/the_sword_dragon/,2016-07-04 09:22:42,"***Sword Dragon*** WARNING: LONG In the ancient study of draconics, truly new developments are rare, and large-scale developments unheard of. The Sword Dragon is an exception to this stagnation. First sighted less than a century ago, Sword Dragons as a species were completely undocumented prior to their appearance decades ago. As they remain scarce, with only several dozen or so documented individuals, Dragonfire adepts and other scholars have varying theories regarding this new species. **Appearance, anatomy, and growth** Sword Dragons are known for their distinctive scales, which are formed from metalloid crystal deposits, naturally enchanted with the Dragons innate magic. these grow and elongate over time into thin, narrow blades, resulting in what appears to be a dragon girded in an armor of swords. Sword Dragons are silver in color, but easy to differentiate from Silver Dragons due to their darker shade, jagged appearance, and smaller size. When surprised or enraged, a sword dragons scales have been known to flare out ward, similar to a cat with its fur standing on end. Sword Dragons are slimmer and slightly smaller than most metallic Dragons of comparable age and size, and have been called catlike. The dragons have three tails until a certain age, with the middle tail perpetually growing a type of vertical, rigid sail out of the metallic crystal. As this sail grows and moves up the Dragons tail, the tail loses its mobility until finally, as an Ancient, the middle tail falls off and becomes a catalyst for the Sword Dragons largely untapped draconic power. The Sword Dragons wings are comparatively muscular and bulky compared to True Dragons, and instead of leather or feathers the Sword Dragon has overlain plates of its metalloid crystals. These limbs have an even wider range of motion than True Dragons wings, while maintaining the fine muscle control used by other dragons in flight. Sword Dragons have a complex style of using their wings as blades, resulting in a type of swordplay few dragons can imitate. The claws on these wings are also larger and more pronounced than in true dragons, who rarely use their wing-claws. A Sword Dragons wing-claw possesses a strong grip and opposable thumbs allowing the Sword Dragon to use them as hands. The status of Sword Dragons as True Dragons is questioned, as Sword Dragons never develop flight, nor do they possess draconic magic to use a formal breath weapon. However, many, especially ancient Sword Dragons, exhibit flashes of the same magic inherent to True Dragons, and can also fire sharp, jagged disks of metal or shrapnel from a flap on the roof of the mouth. As wyrmlings, Sword dragons have no scales on their body save for the long, curved horn that sits flush with the snout and extends past the skull, allowing them to break out of their egg comparatively quickly to other dragons. Even as a wyrmling, a Sword Dragon is a prodigy in the use of all manner of blades, comparable to experts among most sentient races. By the time a Wyrmling becomes a Young dragon, its body is covered in dagger-sized scales, and its sides protrude out more than most dragons, giving it a slightly portly image. (Though these sides cover with scales the developing wings of the Sword Dragon.) By this time the Dragon, though incapable of flight, possesses a natural agility and physical prowess on the ground that leaves its colored contemporaries envious. The young Sword dragon develops a religious routine of sharpening and polishing its scales. At the Adult stage, the Sword Dragons wings unfold and extend from its sides, having completed their metamorphosis and now possessing a deadly lattice of edges and indestructible blades. An adult Sword Dagon quickly masters the use of these wings as lethal weapons in combat, though it will find them unable to provide more flight than a slightly higher jump. Where the wing folded to the side is now bladeless, exposed skin, so adult Sword Dragons tend to use their natural wing-blades only as a last resort, to minimize vulnerability. As an Elder Sword Dragon, the entire body is completely covered in the signature elongated scales, and the Dragon can utilize its unique combat prowess without fear or holding back. Furthermore, the Dragons control over the metals in its body has grown so disciplined that the dragon has learned to fire a spray of shrapnel and metal from its mouth, similar to other breath weapons. An elder Sword Dragon finds itself encumbered by its rigid middle tail, which has now been rendered almost completely immobile, save the tails base. Once a Sword Dragon reaches Ancient age, its middle tail has become immobile to the bone, and falls off, permanently. When this happens, the tail becomes a Gargantuan Greatsword that the Dragons powerful wing-limbs can wield two-handed with ease. This greatsword becomes the catalyst through which the divine lineage and draconic powers of the Sword Dragon are finally unleashed, and the swordsmanship that has been trained for centuries finally comes to its awe-inspiring apex. Few have ever seen an ancient Sword Dragon unleash the full power of its blade, but rumors say that the draconic magic thats remained largely dormant throughout the Dragons life surges with every strike. **Personality** As Sword Dragons are claimed by neither Tiamat nor Bahamut as metallic, chromatic, or even other variations such as catastrophic or scourge, Sword Dragons do not have an official designation of Dragon or alignment. However, several sword dragons have been known to identify themselves as either metallic or chromatic, apparently by personal choice. Furthermore, Sword Dragons reportedly lack the finer points of Draconic culture and heritage, ignorant of many ancient rituals and customs tied to Bahamut and Tiamat. For this reason and more, Sword Dragons are often shunned by dragonkind, and find themselves as familiar with the ways and world of humanoids than those of their draconic brethren. Their lineage from the Greatsword God appears to have more of an effect on their personality than their connections to Tiamat, resulting in several deviations from the culture of other Dragons. For one, Sword Dragons prefer a nomadic lifestyle to lairs, with even the elder Sword Dragons scouring the land for their own secretive purposes. Sword Dragons also lack ambition as one gold dragon puts it; they do not hoard gold or wealth of any sort, save for their pristinely polished and kept scales, and they rarely meddle with the higher affairs of any civilizations or races. Despite their not being technically metallic dragons, a Sword Dragon values its scales more than any other part of its hoard, and polishes its blades religiously throughout its life. The only hoard Sword dragons value more than their hide is their honor; a Sword Dragon is a ceaseless nomad, travelling the world and perfecting its technique until its pristine form is a treasure irreplaceable, worthy of or capable of getting any material wealth that other dragons might hoard. In fact, many Sword Dragons have been known to slot the weapons of defeated foes into their scales, as a way to add to their ever-growing hoard of skill, honor, and objective superiority. **Lore** The favorite explanation among students of the newly-discovered dragon is as follows, perhaps because it is told in the form of a legend, passed down from Sword Dragons to their Wyrmlings. There was once a paladin of Tiamat who, through the might of his swordsmanship, attained godhood and sought freedom from his former mistress. Tiamat lusted after her former champion, and under the promise of destroying their bond as paladin and god, captured the Greatsword Deity. She held him captive as her consort in her realm of Tytherion, and from this unwilling union Tiamat spawned the Sword Dragons, specially bred to be her personal bodyguard. The Talon Swords, as the guard was called, took their draconic body from their mother, and their jagged appearance from their father. However, the Dragons were influenced by his captivity, and thus their wings were made weapons incapable of flight. Despite the martial prowess granted the Swords by their divine lineage, Tiamat viewed their lustrous scales, flightless wings, and three tails as hideous failures. Yet she reveled in bringing the rebellious Greatsword God to his knees before her, and kept the Swords as spoils of war. In a final effort to purify bring the Swords to true dragonhood, Tiamat used divine magic to accelerate the strongest of the Swords, Verexeph, into an Ancient Dragon in body and magic. Verexephs scales gleamed brighter than ever, her wing-limbs grown thick with sinew and muscle, and her middle tail grown rigid and immobile with the complete growth of the sail. enraged, Tiamat cut off the wretched middle tail, and cast both it and Verexeph into the Maggot Pit. Beyond the Dragon Queens gaze, a golden high elf raised Verexeph and her sundered tail from the devils and squirming lemures, telling her that the only way to save her people from Tiamat was to free their father, and escape Tytherion. The Swords, inspired by their sister and naturally inclined to chaotic freedom, infiltrated the divine prison beneath Tiamats fortress, where they found the consort Kasarus guarding the diety with his own divine weapon. Taking her tail in her wing-claws, she channeled the innate power of the greatsword deity through her improvised yet natural blade, and disarmed Kasarus. The dragons and their father escaped with the deitys weapon, and the Sword Dragons have forged their own paths in the material world ever since. "

V0.02 patches: &gt;Fixed preliminary Vulnerability/Resistance debacles. &gt;Removed excessive immunities/bonuses. &gt;Grammar changes to make good, yes. &gt;Gary was found in a safehouse south of Westminster and promptly dealt with. &gt;Stupid name changes that should have been caught earlier have been changed. &gt;Further Nerfing/Mending to be determined in V0.03."
150,vulnerability,DnDHomebrew,[3.5] Myconid PC race,10,3yindl,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/3yindl/35_myconid_pc_race/,2015-12-28 23:42:04,"The moment I saw these guys in the Monster Manual II, I immediately wanted to play as one. Imagine my disappointment when I found out that these creatures were intended to be only monsters. Hopefully, with your help, I can work these shrooms into a PC race. The biggest concerns I have are the Plant-type and automatic nonverbal spells. I don't think that the Plant-type has that many advantages, other than just not being subject to humanoid-targeting effects. Even that only makes somewhat of a difference in the early game, and actually becomes a vulnerability when spells such as Blight and Horrid Wilting become available. The nonverbal spells might be a problem. I opted to go for this option after seeing the usual hate that Buommans get for their inability to speak. Although this might be an advantage, I don't think it's worthy of a +1 or higher LA, especially knowing that the Still Spell and Quicken Spell metamagic are unavailable. While we're on the topic of strange abilities, the spores might seem a bit strong at first glance, but the spores specifically designed to be useful in combat only become available at 4 HD, and even then the DC 10 + half HD + Cha modifier isn't that tough to overcome. In later levels, this will mostly be reduced to a way of reducing the number of stock mooks. Even *then* it would be subject to negation via Heal check. Finally we reach the topic of the extra limb feat. Now while the extra arm is a solid pick for a martial class, bear in mind that it does require the PC to expend a feat, and most classes other than the Fighter and the occasional Rogue build are feat-starved. On the flip side, this would allow the usually underwhelming Fighter class to be more useful in combat, thanks to the potential Extra Limb + Multiattack combo. As for the spellcasters, the only time I see this being useful is when they have both hands busy and need an extra one to cast spells. Fluff-wise, I've decided to drop the whole HD advancement by age, and went for the hive-like organization, where individuals are born and bred for a specific purpose. Although their hive-mentality allows myconids (even from other colonies) to be interconnected, each creature still has its own individuality. Now without further ado: the myconids as a PC race. **LORE** While expanding the dungeons beneath St. Cuthbert's cathedral the workers came across an entrance to the Underdark. They rushed to get the clerics and paladins, who hesitantly went a ways in to explore. After following the long path downwards, they entered a clearing inhabited, to their luck, by one of the most peaceful and level-headed creatures in the Underdark - Myconids. However, when encountered with someone new creatures the wary Fungus-folk were quick to sound the alarms. Soon the small party of clerics and paladins found themselves surrounded by myconids, who thought the intruders to be some kind of pale-skinned orcs or drow. It seemed that blood was about to be drawn, until on of the clerics pulled out his holy symbol, the circled cross of St. Cuthbert, to act as a spell focus. Upon seeing this, the myconids lowered their crude weapons and one of them pulled out a strip of paper with strange symbols written on it. What stunned the holy men who saw the ofuda, was the symbol in its middle, the circled cross... the mark of their deity. As the massive myconid sovereign stepped out from the shadows, he sprinkled spores over the newly arrived humans and dwarves. At first confused and startled, they discovered that the old mushroom was telepathically speaking to them. After a lengthy discussion, it turned out that the two factions served the same deity. A long time ago, a group of traveling nezumi missionaries were lost in the Underdark when they came across the myconid colony. The Fungus-folk showed them hospitality and a safe passage. In turn the nezumi shugenja taught them Onmyoudo, holy magic of their god, ""The One Whose Words Are Set In Stone"", more commonly known in the surface world as St. Cuthbert of The Cudgel. Indeed it seems that his very hand guided this faithful encounter. The priests said their farewells and headed back to the cathedral dungeons where they told their eagerly awaiting brothers and sisters of the encounter. They all agreed that the encounter was fated to be. Not the only ones it would seem, as the very next day the myconids sent an envoy of workers and guardians to make contact with the rest of the world above them. **MYCONIDS AND THE WORLD** Myconids (otherwise known as Fungus-folk) are a race of creatures of the Underdark. Ranging in shapes and sizes, their common features are their devotion to their colonies, and their honesty, stemming from telepathic spore-borne communication. They are regarded as one of the friendlier races of the Underdark. Personality: Myconids in general are obedient, and reclusive. Though they resort to violence as a last resort, they are generally suspicious of outsiders in their colonies. When outside, however, myconids in their confusion tend to cling to the friendlier foreign races to act as their guides. The workers are a bit more wary (some would even say cowardly), while the guardians are more protective of their smaller kinsmen. The Circle Leaders and Sovereign are strict and solemn. They freely share possessions between each other, including myconids of other colonies, as spore exchange cannot contain lies, and therefore theft is not even considered. Physical Description: Myconid start their lives as Spores who quickly develop into miniscule, blueish infant myconids called ""Juniors."" Depending on the needs of the community, these Juniors develop into one of three castes: worker, guardian, or circle leader. The Junior stage last for approximately 3 months. Common physical features between adult myconids are their resilient, spongy bodies, spore-borne communicative abilities, lack of aging effect on their minds and bodies upon adulthood, and the occasional ""extra limb"" mutation. The workers are generally small, approximately the size of halflings. Their caps are either thick, round, sloping and reddish colored, or tall, conical, yellowish colored with a rough, porous texture. The first ones have white bodies, while the latter have ocher colored skin. Their common features are black eyes, short ""legs"", and sweet caramel-like scent. The average lifespan of the worker caste is 15-18 years. Guardians are larger than their worker counterparts, but also more clumsy. The strength of their fibers comes at a cost of duller reflexes. Their bodies, not counting their caps are most often human sized, with the upward-pointed, veiny, funnel-like caps are another 2-3 feet higher. These guardians, who are anatomically similar to the white-bodied workers weigh about the same as humans. The hunchbacked guardians, similar to the ocher workers, do not have caps, but instead have numerous small, porous, conical protrusions on their backs. Their build is more similar to orcs. The life expectancy of guardians is 35-40 years. The Circle Leaders are massively build, resembling ogres in myconid form, with a massive cap covering their heads and several smaller caps sprouting from their back and shoulders. They are, however, much more intelligent than ogres. The Sovereign is unanimously chosen among the Circle Leaders (usually the oldest one). The life spans of Circle Leaders vastly vary, between 200 years to as many as 1300 years. The myconids wear no clothes per se, though they will sometimes carry backpacks of satchels. They are often found using shiny, semi-translucent crystal tools. Relations: Because of their spore-borne communication, and sharing of mindsets, myconid of any colony **always** come to an agreement. The process allows complete strangers to link as if they had lived their entire lives together. No race can hope to achieve this closeness with a myconid, even if they spend their entire lives together. The myconids tend to find some humans most open-minded and accepting, though they tend to be reserved as many humans attempt to take advantage of the honest Fungus-folk. Indeed, this honesty can sometimes be so blunt as to harm otherwise friendly relations. Myconids find the lawful demeanor of the dwarves to be praiseworthy. The lawful personalities common in dragonborn and warforged, coupled with their alienation from everyday society caused them to quickly become accepted in myconid communities. Elves and gnomes are considered downright repulsive due to their lighthearted stance on lying (poetic styles and jokes respectively). Half-elves are connected strongly to the elves in the minds of myconids. The Fungus-folk deem orcs, with whom they often clashed in the Underdark, to be ruthless and disorganized savages. So far, few Half-orcs have dissuaded this connection. The myconids do not care much for halflings, as they are not unified. They also do not care for the good and evil notions that the extraplanars and their kin (tieflings and aasimar) embody, so long as they are honest and law abiding. Among these the myconids have found reliable friends in the archons, and unreliable truces with the devils. The drow they encounter in the Underdark are considered too treacherous to be reasoned with. Finally, myconid were flabbergasted, as well as greatly disappointed, to find out that the steadfast nezumi sages which brought them the word of their god are a minuscule group who left most of their kinsmen, as they did not agree with their usual chaotic natures. Alignment: All myconids are naturally lawful without exception. When minds are connected no lies can persist, and ones who do not do their duties are left in the cold caverns of the Underdark to die alone. Lawfulness is ingrained into every fiber of their beings. The only nonlawful myconids are magically manipulated ones, who often commit suicide out of shame if ever released. Myconids are mostly neutral on the good/evil axis. They lean slightly towards good, due to their friendly and peaceful personalities, but are no strangers to cruelty when enforcing the law upon chaotic individuals. Lands: Myconids usually live in the Underdark in scattered communities numbering anywhere between 500 and 5000 individuals. These colonies are off the beaten paths of drow and grey orcs. The colonies are divided into Circles, each run by a circle leader. The colony leader is called a Sovereign, and is usually the eldest circle leader. Myconids often raise non-sapient fungal creatures such as toad-clusters, earlings, and of course their famous fungal hounds (stalker and warbeast breeds). Although these creatures cannot understand language, they are quite responsive to spore-based messages, allowing for easy domestication. Language: Myconids primarily communicate telepathically via spores. This works on other races, albeit to a lesser degree. The telepathic connection lasts for 8 hours for myconids and 30-60 minutes for non-myconids. Even though they cannot speak, they can understand what others talk if they have learned the language. Because they are unable to utter words, spells are cast without verbal components. Spells with only verbal components are cast with somatic components instead. Spells cast by myconids can never be metamagically altered to be Stil or Quickened. Names: Myconids do not have names in the traditional sense. Each one's identity is contained in their spores. Among other races, they either use nicknames given to them or their positions in their colony. Adventures: Although many myconid go above land to expand their colonies and trade items and knowledge, most of them go on adventures to help friends from other races in need. **RACIAL TRAITS** &gt; **General** &gt; Plant creature. The myconid possesses Low-light vision, is immune to mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, polymorph, and stunning. The creature is, however, subject to critical hits. &gt; The myconid's Hit Die, Base Attack Bonus, Save Bonuses, Weapon and Armor Proficiencies, and Skill Points depend on its class. &gt; The myconid breathes and eats, but need not sleep. A myconid arcane spellcaster must remain motionless for 8 hours, as if sleeping, in order to recover their spells. &gt; The myconid's body is a different shape from most humanoids and must wear armor shaped especially for their form, if any. &gt; The myconid cannot speak. Spells cast by myconid do not require verbal components, but always require somatic components. Spells cast by myconid cannot be modified by metamagic feats to be Quickened or Still. &gt; Myconid are not subject to aging effects. Once a myconid reaches adulthood, it changes very little throughout its lifetime. &gt; Myconid are able to consume spoiled, rotting, or otherwise inedible organic matter, without suffering any negative side effects. &gt; Myconid gain a +2 racial bonus to Knowledge (Nature) and Knowledge (Dungeoneering). &gt; Spores(Ex). Every myconid knows the ability ""alarm spores"". Each time the myconid gains HD (level), it receives the next type of spores. The myconid may use each type a number of times equal to its HD per day. Using any kind of spores is a standard action. &gt; * Alarm Spores: These spores alert all other myconids within the area that danger is near. They are released in a 120-foot spread. &gt; * Reproduction Spores: These spores eventually germinate into new infant myconids. They are released as a 120-foot spread and have no detrimental effects on nonmyconids. &gt; * Rapport Spores: Myconids do not speak, but these spores enable them to establish telepathic communication with each other and with other species. A successful fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + half HD + Cha modifier) negates the effect, but it is harmless. Rapport lasts for 30 to 60 minutes with non-myconids (3d10+30 minutes), but for 8 hours with other myconids. Rapport spores can be released as either a 120-foot spread or a 40-foot ray. Regardless of the release area, the communication range is 120 feet once rapport is established. A Heal check made against the ability's DC (DC 10 + half HD + Cha modifier) negates the effect. &gt; * Pacification Spores: These spores are released as a 40-foot ray. The target must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + half HD + Cha modifier) or become passive for 1 minute. Being passive is similar to being dazed, except that the target can take partial actions that dont involve attacking. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. A Heal check made against the ability's DC (DC 10 + half HD + Cha modifier) negates the effect. &gt; * Hallucination Spores: These spores are released as a 40-foot ray. The target must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + half HD + Cha modifier) or suffer powerful hallucinations that duplicate the effects of a confusion spell for 1 hour. A Heal check made against the ability's DC (DC 10 + half HD + Cha modifier) negates the effect. &gt; * Animation Spores: Only the myconid circle leader has access to these spores. When released over a dead body, animation spores begin a process that covers the corpse with purple fungus. After 1d4 days, the corpse reanimates as a servant. A servant has all the characteristics of a zombie of the same size, except that it retains its previous creature type and it cannot be turned or otherwise affected as an undead. Over the course of 1d6 weeks, a myconid-animated corpse slowly decays. At the end of that period it simply disintegrates into dust. &gt; Extra limbs: A myconid may grow an extra arm or leg by spending one of its standard feats. &gt; * Extra arm: A mycond may use its extra arm to gain an extra attack. The myconid ""brain"" is able to concentrate only on up to 4 arms per turn. Other arms do not have any weapon proficiency, nor can they perform somatic spell components. &gt; * Extra leg: A myconid with 3 or more legs increases its carrying capacity as if it was a quadrupedal creature. More that 3 legs do not effectively stack the increase in carrying capacity, but if a myconid with more than 3 legs loses one, it does not lose the increase in carrying capacity. &gt; Automatic Language: None. Bonus Language: Any. &gt; **Guardian Specific** &gt; Medium Size. &gt; -2 Dex, +2 Con. The myconids body is spongy and resilient, able to survive injury which would normally spell death for the average human. The guards, with their primary purpose of defending their colony, are not well suited to crafting or operating finer items. &gt; **Worker Specific** &gt; Small Size. A Small character gets a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks. A Small characters carrying capacity is three-quarters of that of a Medium character. &gt; -2 Str, +2 Con. Although the myconids' spongy body is quite resilient, the workers' muscles are more adapted to fine-tuned movement rather than power. &gt; **Circle Leader Specific** &gt; Level Adjustment +3. &gt; Large size. -1 penalty to Armor Class, -1 penalty on attack rolls, -4 penalty on Hide checks, +4 bonus on grapple checks, lifting and carrying limits double those of Medium characters. &gt; Reach/Space: 10 feet / 10 feet. &gt; +2 Str, +2 Con, +2 Wis. The Circle Leaders possess a powerful stature, and are well attuned with their surroundings. &gt; Potion Making (Su): Though it is not a spellcaster, a myconid circle leader can create various potions that mimic cleric and druid spells. It can duplicate the following effects, each once per day (but only for the purpose of brewing potions): bulls strength, cure light wounds, cure moderate wounds, cure serious wounds, delay poison, endurance, endure elements, greater magic fang, invisibility to animals, lesser restoration, magic fang, negative energy protection, neutralize poison, protection from elements, remove blindness/deafness, remove disease, remove paralysis, resist elements. Caster level as HD; save DC 10 + spell level + Cha modifier. P. S. I might edit in the changes suggested in the comments. I will certainly add the entries and stats for the Earling Swarm, the Fungal Hound Tracker, and the Fungal Hound Guard. Whether they will be in this post or a separate one, I'm not sure. The Toad-clusters are simply groups of densely packed, tiny mushrooms with 60 ft Tremorsense and a 60 ft telepathic bond with each other. A myconid can use its rapport spores to use Toad-clusters as a surveillance network. P. P. S. I purposefully left the Favored Class slot empty. I wanna hear your opinions on that one. EDIT: Just added that using spores is a standard action and an extraordinary ability. Specified the time on the rapport spores + clarity."
