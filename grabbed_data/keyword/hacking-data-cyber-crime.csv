Not a hacker, thought this would be the best subreddit to ask. Less than two years ago i bought a old blackberry keypad phone off a site similar to Craigslist. I lost it within the house then yesterday i found it. Are there any chances of it being hacked ? Like can pictures on the phone be leaked? The package came sealed with plastic and all and shipping company did mention that the product wasn't second hand, but i have my doubts. How i check whether its hack or not. What are the chances. (Ps, i just watched a few documentaries and movies about cyber crime , hacking and scamming for the last few weeks and i think im going crazy doubting every next thing which is technology and digital)"
1,cyber-crime,hacking,"I feel so violated right now. Phone, gmail hacked and Apple support were surprised at how this was done.",1,dxzvc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/dxzvc1/i_feel_so_violated_right_now_phone_gmail_hacked/,2019-11-18 18:17:40,"Hello everyone, I'm really looking for any input or help on what happened to me today. My goal is to find out how to protect my iphone and my accounts from my current employer who hacked into my gmail account. This might be hard to believe but it is all true and I am in shock about it still. I'm desperate and looking for anyone to please help me understand this, or even just help. I feel so alone and helpless right now. I have never, ever felt like this. Here's the story: Two months ago I started working for a company in the environmental/renewables space. The first week of training I received a new Macbook Air and pulled it out of the box, brand new (or so it seemed so), started it up, chose the language etc etc. I have never left the computer alone with anyone since I started it up. I do not share it with anyone. I began meeting with clients, emailing, making calls - normal duties. But I began to notice odd behavior all around me. I'll spare you most of the details but suffice it to say, I felt like my employer was doing odd things. It's going to sound crazy but it isn't. I felt like they were spying on me. For various reasons and observations, I realized that this company was shady and that they were unethical. They didn't pay on time, they didn't keep to their appointments with customers and much, much more. So I began to look for another job. I applied to a position I found on Craigslist. They replied and I came down for an inverview. I recall thinking it happened quite easily and fast. I researched the company and found that they didn't have much of a history before late September. They had a website, FB, Twitter, BBB, Instagram... but all were started late september or early October. I thought that was strange but they said they were rebranding. I started getting an uneasy feeling for some reason. I don't know why but I started getting a feeling that something was off. That my current company knew I was talking to this company. They started doing things that seemed suspicious to me, that I'm too exhausted to write out but it raised hairs on the back of my neck even more. Fast forward to a few weeks and after even more crazy things happening at my current position, I decided to move on. I felt bad, part of me, but if you knew all the weird things that happened, then you'd leave too. I emailed the hiring manager and said I'm interested and he wrote back when I would be able to give notice? I had a busy day and didn't reply back (I received this email yesterday morning) and At 4pm today, while with a client in her home, I received a text from my Current boss/manager: **It was a screenshot of my personal gmail account, of my conversation thread with the hiring manager from the other company.** I stared at it for a minute while my client asked me a question. Again, it was a screenshot, an iphone screenshot, of my email conversation with the hiring manager that had just offered me a job. This was taken from my inbox, so whoever took the photo, took it from/with access to my gmail inbox. And I'm not sure how experienced or technically adept the senior technical iphone guy from Apple was, but he said he has never seen this before: The text message that CAME IN TO ME ON MY iMESSAGE text from my boss, looked like it was sent by me. I repeat, even though the screenshot that my boss sent to me via imessage, was sent by him, it LOOKED LIKE I SENT IT TO HIM. The Apple tech said, he has never seen a text message sent/spoofed to a phone, where the bubbled was on the RIGHT side, where it looked like I sent it, not received it. So somehow my boss (or his lackey, wont' go into this now) managed to send this screenshot to my phone, but made it look like it was me who sent it to him. Like it was from me. &amp;#x200B; The apple tech and I spoke about this at length. I did not use imessages or set it up on the company Macbook air. So they didn't have access to my imessages. I DID log into my company macbook air using my personal gmail passwords. But I have 2-step verification on all of my gmail accounts. I NEVER RECEIVED A NOTIFICATION on my phone or any gmail accounts alerting me to anyone logging in from a device I didn't recognize. How did they get access to my gmail account then? With gmail's two-step verification, no access to my imessage -- how? &amp;#x200B; I called my boss immediately after the meeting and dumbfoundedly asked, ""How did you get access to my email account? What is this text message that you sent me? Looks like you have access to my gmail account."" For anyone that cares, I was calm and curious albeit stuttering and confused. I was in shock and couldn't believe he did this and kept saying how, and I kept thinking... WHY? For the simple sake of keeping tabs on me? A new employee? A nobody who was just trying to do my job? The rush of emotions and thoughts were overwhelming. How could someone do this? How immoral can a company be to sanction this behavior? This is pathological and crazy. I feel so violated and powerless. I know no one knows me here but I am a genuinely good person that tries to treat everyone I meet with kindness and empathy. I cannot fathom why and how anyone could systematically hack into another's email and read their private messages, look through their private documents (Google Drive) and not stop to think how that would make the other person feel?? I don't have anything to snoop through -- I'm a boring person. I don't do drugs, hardly drink, don't take any medication or have a seedy, side-sex-life. Well, on the phone my manager denied it. In my utter and complete shock, he said, ""What text? I didn't send you a text."" I said, ""huh? What do you mean, I'm looking at it right now, you sent this to me."" At first I thought he was kidding, then realized he was purposely playing dumb. He said if he had sent me a text, he would've known and that, his texts are in dark mode, which they had never been before that. **His tone of voice was slightly smug, while he continued to say that maybe his lackey was the one who did it (we'll call him Keith).** Full Stop. I said, ""what? Why would Keith send me a text message of my gmail inbox with my conversation with someone else?"" It dawned on me right there, horrifically, that he had had Keith hack into my private email somehow. Or maybe they had some sort of monitoring program on the Macbook Air? I didn't realize something could be installed BEFORE you set up the Macbook Air for yourself. The computers looked new and out of the box. **TLDR:** My question is: How did they manage to send a text message To Me, that looked like I sent it to them? Let me tell you people, that is exactly what happened. I didn't accidentally take a screenshot of my conversation with another potential employer, then accidentally send it to my own boss, while in the middle of a meeting with a client. How was this accomplished? You know how on imessages your texts are on the right and theirs are on the left? This text/screenshot that showed up on my phone was on the RIGHT, but Not sent by me. Can someone send you remotely, somehow spoofed texts that show up on the right? Can someone take over your phone remotely somehow and send a text to someone? If so, how? Is there a trail that shows they did it? That they had access to my phone? &amp;#x200B; There is much, much more. but I will leave this here for now. I was told that it is illegal to hack into someone's email. That it is a cyber crime of some sort. But who is going to care about a nobody like me and my hacked email account? This sucks so bad and I'm just trying to make an honest living -- I value my privacy too. a lot. Even though I have nothing to be private about. It's important to me. Any thoughts suggestions or information would be GREATLY appreciate. &amp;#x200B; Warmly\~\~ Anonymous for now."

This tool is only available only on Linux, and it comes pre-installed with Kali Linux. Guymager is created by Dutch developer Guy Voncken. Image acquisition is a must need process in digital forensic researches. With this process we can clone an entire disk like pen drives or hard disks or memory cards. We can copy a total disk with guymager.In the previous tutorial we have learned about [Foremost](URL tool to recover permanently deleted items. But before recovering data using foremost we should copy the drive using guymager. &amp;#x200B; URL For solving cyber crimes on digital materials, they have to be cloned. An evidence must be copied in a valid and proper method that provides legal availability. If we do not copied in a valid way, it can not be used as an evidence. Image acquisition of the materials from the crime scene by using the proper hardware and software tools makes the obtained data legal evidence. Choosing the proper format and verification function when image acquisition affects the steps in the research process. Using this method we can clone a disk and do research on multiple systems using multiple software and solve the case faster. Guymager is based on libewf and libguytools. The features of guymager is following: * Very easy GUI user interface in different language. * Really fast process due to multi-threaded, pipelined design and multi-threaded data compression. * makes full usage of multi-processor machines. * Generates flat (dd), EWF(E01) and AFF images, supports disk cloning. * For becoming open source it is completely free of charges. Now we run guymager in our Kali Linux system. To run this tool we simply use `guymager` command in our terminal window. `guymager` Providing command will open it's window as following: &amp;#x200B; [guymager](URL We can use the ""Rescan"" option to scan newly attached devices. Now we connect our pen drive and click on Rescan or simply press F5 button. &amp;#x200B; [our disk parts](URL Here we can see the serial Number and other information of our pen drive. Now we can acquire image and clone our pen drive by right click on the disk. For cloning our pen drive we click on clone and anther window will opens. &amp;#x200B; URL Here we can see that we can clone the pen drive on our hard disks or any other flash drives. To acquire image we need to right click on the disk and select the acquire option and a new window will pop up. &amp;#x200B; *Processing img dz4mdvdj92s31...* Here we can choose the file format and provide the case number and evidence number, examiner, descriptions and notes. Here we can also choose the image directory. We can also split the size of disk. We can calculate MD% and SHA1 and SHA-256. Then we must check the verification process, because if the image acquisition was not valid then it can't be an evidence. So verification is a good habit. Here we have done everything, and set the acquired image directory in our desktop, and we did not used the split image because we are not acquiring large image. Following screenshot shows the process. &amp;#x200B; URL Then we just click on start option and the process will started. &amp;#x200B; URL After finishing this process we will get a dd image file in our Desktop. &amp;#x200B; URL This tutorial is copied from [KaliLinux.In](URL Will this tutorial was helpful ? **For more helpful tutorial like this** [**Visit Here**](URL [How to recover permanently deleted data ?](URL [Truth of Facebook Hacking](URL [How to be Anonymous (Tor VPN proxies detailed)](URL"

6,cyber-crime,hacking,I think I experienced a cyber crime while employed in a major sports league and need help understanding what happened.,10,8xdnn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/8xdnn3/i_think_i_experienced_a_cyber_crime_while/,2018-07-10 03:02:51,"This turned out longer than I initially planned -- sorry in advance for the essay, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. The main reason I'm posting this story is because I want to figure out what really happened. I still have the system logs, network activity, Slack conversations, and several screenshots from the night I mention. I don't know how much of it is actually relevant, but if there's something in there that someone with iOS or network security can decipher, I would want to talk to them, if only for my own sanity. There are things that happened here that are my own fault, and due to my technical naivety. I'm just looking for advice on what my options are and to understand the situation, not a reprimand for the poor decision-making. About 2 years ago, I was working at a media/tech company under the umbrella of a major sports league when this happened. The league's tech side (~2000 people) acquired the software company I worked at (~50 people) in fall 2015. This was my first job right after college in summer 2015 and I was officially hired as the merger was announced. I work in UI design, and my software and IT knowledge was lacking at the time. I was bringing my personal macbook to the office, and doing most of my work through there for a few months. After the company was acquired, I continued to do so. My work laptop was several years old and too slow for Adobe software that I was using daily. Around late spring of 2016, I started noticing unusual behavior on my work laptop. Recent searches appearing that I never typed, new Spotlight search recommendations like Activity Monitor and Network tools, apps accessed that I never use, files opened that I rarely access. One example is with the Dropbox app - my personal account was connected to my work computer, and I noticed my selective sync settings kept changing to sync my personal folders, which I explicitly made sure to exclude. I had to keep changing them almost daily. I ended up staying late one Friday night to try to fix it. I thought changing my work computer permissions would stop it, and surprise, it stopped working after that genius idea. I still had my personal computer with me, which I started using at that point. I pinged a coworker on Slack who confirmed that the company does indeed have remote access to our machines through Meraki, and that he uses Little Snitch to block access. He sent me the link to it and I downloaded it. He suggested I boot the work laptop into single user mode to fix those permissions and sent some links to help. At this point, it's 9pm and there's a dev who's also staying late. I tell him what's going on with the permissions and all and he sends me other links, and tells me to run those commands to fix it. None of them work or really change anything. I attempt to call our company 24/7 IT support but it goes to voicemail. I message a few more people on Hipchat, but no one can really help. Eventually, I drive directly home. Once I get home, I see this Little Snitch tool constantly pinging me on my personal machine, but can't recall what the notifications said said. I changed some of the settings, which might've have opened some kind of door into my machine. This is when it starts getting scary. As I attempt to revert the settings, I see the settings change back and lock, as if I didn't do anything. I keep trying to change this with no luck. Windows start popping on my screen for system settings and I hear that apple lock sound open, which I quickly try to counteract. Essentially, I go into panic mode and start defending my computer against all these attacks which are happening every second. Notifications that looked inauthentic and almost like a fake Apple UI with blurry icons keep popping up requesting my password, which I try to exit from. At some point in the night, I booted into recovery mode and saw what looked like another drive, or connection, that was connected to my computer. I could see what they were doing and saw that a folder being viewed in my Dropbox folder. I realized I could look into their directory as well, but the only folder I was able to see before they disconnected was called Power Management. I can't remember all the details of that night, but it ended with me locking myself out of my own machine when creating a Firmware password. The password I setup wasn't working. I was mostly worried about access to private information like bank/email passwords, family info, etc. When I called Apple after the Firmware lockout, they asked me if my operating system was bootleg, and doubted the authenticity of my operating system. I end up taking it to the Apple store that day. They were really concerned and adamant about this. Is there a possibility that my experience at home with the obvious remote connection is due to something that happened at work via the network? I have no idea why they would think my operating system was fake and I can't really explain how that would happen. I got in the office late that following Monday and was really distraught after messing up both my work and personal computers. The IT guy gave me a loaner machine to use in the meantime. I am still seeing the activity I saw on my original work machine that prompted my suspicion like recommended Spotlight searches of network activity files and Activity Monitor that never came up in the past. I end up looking into system logs and console activity and not really understanding what I'm looking at, but I still save it. It starts getting really late at this point, like 2 am and I am there alone. And this is the really fucked up part when I start to hear noises throughout the office. Two women talking to each other like they're having a conversation. They're whispering to each other, and I can't make out what they're actually saying, but it's loud enough that I can hear them. I start walking around the office trying to find where it's coming from but I can't find them anywhere. I walk around but there's no one around. I go back to my desk and continue to save logs. I realize what's going on is that there is someone actively mirroring my display and viewing my screen via an Apple TV and various other connected devices. At just the right moment, I'm able to change settings and view their screen, seeing their desktop. It quickly goes back to my screen as they disconnect. I also realize there's a remote connection via a Mac Mini, and I somehow am able to view their widgets screen. None of this would ever on this computer before. I also hear the sound of doors closing across the office by the kitchen, but when I go there there is no one there. When I go to the bathroom at one point, I hear two guys talking to each other in the men's bathroom, and I assume that's who's been in the office. As I walk back to my desk, I see one of the employees walking outside in the distance towards his house, the same guy who sent me links on changing permissions. At this point it's 7am and the receptionist is making coffee. I start to hear their voices again coming from an office near the main door. As I walk towards this office, the receptionist enters through the main door, and is walking towards me in the opposite direction. There is a burst of laughter, very loudly and clearly, from that office I'm about to walk into. The receptionist and I both look at each other and I say explicitly, ""You heard that, right?"" and she confirms that she did but we both see no one there. I go back to my desk and see the first dev arrive. When I walk away from his area, I hear the first voices I heard of the women. This time, I can clearly hear her say, ""Is she gone?"" and when I approach, he is just standing over someone's empty desk responding when there's no one else there. I wonder if this was all just a sick prank and if this all of this was being sent on some kind of speaker. There is much more that happened afterwards regarding HR, an attempt to escalate the issue, and non-stop verbal harassment until I had no choice but to quit.All of this raises some very disturbing questions... although management is allowed to monitor employees, at what point does it become malicious behavior? And who was it that kept viewing mirroring my display when I was there that night? I'm not sure if this is the proper subreddit for this story, and looking for all the help I can get, so I'll be posting to similar channels as well. TLDR: While working at my former job, I experienced remote connections to my computer. I saved log files and online conversations and want to understand on a technicaly level what happened and who I can talk to about this. "

A quick glance on the test exams, and I was like... HOLEEEY SHIIIT! A. 6 Hours B. 250 Questions C. Graded on what appears to be a percentile rating, per exam season given out Basically like a Network-Geek version of the LSAT (Law Student Admission Test). Or the Uniform CPA Examination for accountants. ***So does Cybrary have the right stuff, up-to-date materials to prep me for the CISSP Exam? Or should I seek a for-profit school?*** And it seems that XSS (Cross Site Scripting) is the ""Go-To Trend"" for penetration testing right now. ***Is there a Python-coding book I can read that provides up to date examples?*** I am taking these courses on the side, since my graduation for my Accounting Degree is being postponed until Fall 2017. I have some legal issues IRL (committed a violent crime, road rage related, beat somebody up) and I decided to ""keep myself busy"" taking some online IT courses to better round out my Accounting Degree. Potentially, if what I am dealing with ""works out"" and I get a lenient sentence, I might still consider applying and testing for entry into my local law school. You know, to become a criminal defense lawyer, that defends ""Cyber-Criminals"". I think we are going to need a lot more of them, as well as civil litigators from all the crazy shit I see on the news. A few matters of concern when I am on Cybrary. Some courses are very concise while other courses seem to be heavily lacking beyond a ""intro"" or ""overview"" of a topic. Divided between modules, a instructor could be very detailed on one topic and heavily lacking on the next. I also keep getting these pop-ups about free testing for certifications and I am not sure if they are ""legit certifications"" or not. ***Right now I am reading three books*** **Violent Python**, overall the author is a great writer, and tells great stories, but some of the Python applications he wrote is using a outdated version of Python (2.6 or something). I still practice coding from the material first until I can get most of it right. Then analyze the functions, modules, and code line-by-line so I understand what it means. Plus some guy on GitHub actually managed to convert all of the code to 2.7.13. After looking at the code in the book, and the corrections provided by that guy on GH, *I breathed a sigh of relief that we have Python 2.7.x and 3.x* Violent Python kept me interested about hacking. On how Kevin Mitnick managed to break into someone's machine by taking out the server first, spoofing the IP, and then correctly predicting the TCP Sequence using his math skills and then stealing the victim's data, without having to learn of a username or password at all. Or proving how a Anonymous LOIC user could be easily identified and tracked using a hastily typed Python script. Or applying Python to decrypt a Skype profile database sqlite file. Compared to the other books, Violent Python seemed to be the ""closest to real life book"" by demonstrating a actual use for Python and penetration testing/IT. Edit: Holeee fuck! Is this real?!? Kevin Mitnick is hosting a QA right now!!! URL **Black Hat Python**, coding, tools used, and techniques seem more up to date. I like the book alot, but I find myself constantly scrolling around to understand ""the big picture"" first. It's easy to get lost without realizing the purpose of each of the tools. I am not done reading it. **Red Team Field Manual**. Flipping between the pages, it looks like one of those laminated ""study guides"" that you find at a bookstore. However, some of the commands are really handy, like locating the password hashes in a compromised machine. Or clearing out your bash history, preventing history logging, and clearing out your Auth.log. The author forgot about clearing out the thumbnails cache though. That's useful if you tend to take screenshots when you are doing reconnaissance. In Kali Linux, type ""locate thumbnails"", and it'll print out as /root/.cache/thumbnails/, then just ""rm -rf"" it. A new thumbnails cache will be generated whenever you view another image. And obviously, these ""Cover Your Tracks Commands"" on Page 7 assumes that you are following the common sense, ""delete the implicating evidence first"" kind of protocol. Right now in my Python application I am writing myself, I am coding a ""one-button solution"" to ""clear all implicating evidence"" without breaking anyone's machine. The RTFM is assuming that you are running some sort of Linux Derivative, and not all commands would work off the bat. Not without testing them out and changing it first. **FYI I am not sure what I want to be in my life right now**. Well first, fix my shit in court and then finish my Accounting Degree. Then consider just signing up for a first time exam in the IT field. And start studying for my LSAT (if Law School is still available). "

Do people just connect to VPNs and go from there or is it better to connect to a VPN service, remote into a server/system from the VPN and then work from that instance? For example to circumvent our content filter at work I created an AWS free tier Ubuntu VM to act as a SOCK5 proxy and then configured Firefox to connect to that proxy, it requires a .pem key in PuTTY to connect to as well as a password, the AWS instance is locked down so I can only connect to it from my work IP address, I figure I could probably further use this VM for pen-testing given that the IP address simply points to an AWS IP based in the USA and subject to USA cyber crime laws (if I was acting unlawfully of course) For my own OpSec this would be a bad idea because the AWS account is linked to my work email/name and I'm not sure what the Amazon policy is around providing information on legal request from an agency/judge, so I wonder how I would go about minimizing my own exposure while looking for vulnerabilities in the real world (I say real world as testing on vulnerable VMs isn't the same) I have some clients at work that I am looking to approach and agree to pen-test the environments that I manage on contract already (lawful agreement to effectively hack my own systems I guess?) because it means I can learn and we can patch anything that I find but I would also want to ensure that what I am doing cannot be seen or easily detected by others to protect my client as well as myself.

15,cyber-crime,hacking,Newbie here. My computer has been hacked. Need to gather evidence of this hack and the identity of the attacker in order to take legal action. Are there any free self-help books that might help me gather this evidence?,9,30gu29,http://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/30gu29/newbie_here_my_computer_has_been_hacked_need_to/,2015-03-27 17:40:23,"Excuse my terrible grammar; English is not my native language. Anyways, I am a total newbie. I believe my computer has been hacked. I have received a few *self-destructive emails* which indicated that with near full certainty. Besides I am an activist, and it makes me a high target individual in a corrupt country. Therefore, I am looking for a *free* self-help book that can help me gather evidence of this cyber-crime and report it to the authorities. The book has to be *brief and easy to understand, with step-by-step instructions*. I need evidence of: * The compromisation of my system * The identity and location of the attacker with conclusive proof (since the burden of proof is on me to prove this is the person who compromised the system in reality) This would have been all great if there were ethical network security specialists who could have identified this quickly and inexpensively. However I live in a developing country where even the police system is terribly corrupt, so I will have to do the tasks of gathering evidence myself before trying my case before the magistrate. I can acquaire legal help, however help from computer experts and police are out of the question. PS: I am using tails on a different computer to access Reddit, so my replies would be a few days late. "
