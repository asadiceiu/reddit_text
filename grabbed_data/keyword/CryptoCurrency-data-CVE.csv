2,CVE,CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin DoS Vulnerability Explained in Full,6,9h2339,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9h2339/bitcoin_dos_vulnerability_explained_in_full/,2018-09-19 14:27:58,"Bitcoin Denial of Service Vulnerability Found in Core Code (Patched) Today, on September, 18th, 2018, there was a vulnerability in the Bitcoin client (specifically versions 0.14.0 and 0.16.2) that were identified by an anonymous reporter via [Bitcoin Cores main repository.](URL There has [since been a fix](URL that was released formally by [Pierre Rochard,](URL a developer (?) on the Core team. According to the documentation of the fix, posted in the GitHub cited above, &gt; A denial-of-service vulnerability (CVE-201817144) exploitable by miners has been discovered in Bitcoin Core versions 0.14.0 up to 0.16.2. It is recommended to upgrade any of the vulnerable versions to 0.16.3 as soon as possible. # Description of the Issue The issue, which was exposed to a greater audience via a Reddit post, appears be borne from a flaw in the compilation of transaction data on the protocol. Specifically, [this mailchimp newsletter,](URL referenced in the Pierre Rochard pull request, covers the issue in greater depth. **_In the newsletter, it states:_** &gt;  **Upgrade to Bitcoin Core 0.16.3 to fix denial-of-service vulnerability:** a bug introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 and affecting all subsequent versions through to 0.16.2 will cause Bitcoin Core to crash when attempting to validate a block containing a transaction that attempts to spend the same input twice. Such blocks would be invalid and so can only be created by miners willing to lose the allowed income from having created a block (at least 12.5 XBT or $80,000 USD). Herein lies the vulnerability, as described above. While it may seem insignificant at face value, it could actually cause considerable issues on the network. Before explaining some of the issues that it could cause, its best to first make sure that were caught up to speed on what a Denial of Service attack is and what it means in the context of blockchain, specifically Bitcoin. # What is a Denial of Service Attack? According to us-cert.gov, &gt;  A denial-of-service (DoS) attack occurs when legitimate users are unable to access information systems, devices, or other network resources due to the actions of a malicious cyber threat actor. Services affected may include email, websites, online accounts (e.g., banking), or other services that rely on the affected computer or network. A denial-of-service is accomplished by flooding the targeted host or network with traffic until the target cannot respond or simply crashes, preventing access for legitimate users. DoS attacks can cost an organization both time and money while their resources and services are inaccessible. Whats stated above is a bit of a mouthful, but it does accurately describe what a Denial of Service tends to be. Now, in the context of blockchain, since it is a decentralized protocol, a denial of service attack is not the exact equivalent in this case (typically, it renders a network inaccessible), but the fundamental principle is the same. # One of Satoshis Main Concerns was Preventing DoS Attacks on Bitcoin In order to assess the impact of a DoS attack on Bitcoin, we need not look any further than at the forum posts [posted by Satoshi Nakamoto himself.](URL [**_Where is the separate discussion devoted to possible Bitcoin weaknesses._** Where is the separate discussion devoted to possible Bitcoin weaknesses.bitcointalk.org](URL ""URL In the conversation cited above, Satoshi admitted that he/she/they were musing the possibility of adding a PoW operation to transactions in order to ensure their validity and prevent a DoS attack via a flood of inaccurate transactions. The greater alternative that was decided upon by Satoshi was to just create a fee market while giving miners the option to only mine transactions that contained the greatest fees. The logic behind this decision was that, if the mempool became clogged with illicit/fraudulent transactions, then users would be able to bid with other users to have their transactions mined by applying a fee to the network (which miners would receive for successfully mining a block that included said transactions). By doing so, Satoshi reasoned that this would undermine a DoS attack by simply allowing the legitimate actors (on the user-facing end) to get their transactions confirmed without delay by simply offering a higher fee to the miners for mining their transaction. In such a situation, an attacker would need to outbid the majority of legitimate actors on the protocol in order to ensure that they accomplished their mission, because their transactions would be reviewed first before the others, thus creating a lull in the chain. ## Assessing Satoshis Fee Model Method for Preventing DoS Attacks While Satoshis method of preventing DoS attacks is not bullet proof and there were tertiary consequences to its implementation that were not felt until years later (i.e., the 1 MB block limit being hit, resulting in an excess amount of TXs in the mempool, which spiked the fee rate on the protocol exponentially), it still proves to be the most effective and least invasive means of preventing a DoS attack. And, the core philosophy (pun intended), mirrors Satoshis to the extent that security has been considered paramount to the efficiency of the chain itself. **_Here are some of the implementations of DoS-prevention measures on Bitcoin:_** ![](URL ![](URL Source: [URL # Potential Threats in the [Patched] DoS Susceptibility in Older Bitcoin Client Versions (0.16.2 &amp; 0.14) Based on what we know, the obvious threat comes from the fact that invalid transactions being mined would result in the failure of nodes on the above listed clients. This means that the attack vector inherent in this incident would stem from a miner mining an invalid block purposefully, which would be a waste of the resources that are necessary to fulfill the Proof of Work as well as the forfeited block reward (12.5 BTC at the time of writing). However, they would succeed in knocking out a number of nodes on the network, which could then open the network up to more nefarious attacks. A full node is not necessary for mining, but it is rare that any mining operations would be running on the protocol without one, since it is helpful to know when a block has been propagated to the network. It is also not entirely uncommon that an incorrect block could be propagated to the network. # Conclusion After review of the issue and the subsequent fix, it appears that the issue itself is under control. As to how the issue itself manifested in the code of Bitcoin Core is a question that remains unanswered at this point in time, but the important thing for Bitcoin users is that it has been fixed. Again, more information can be found in the links posted throughout this piece."

4,CVE,CryptoCurrency,US Congressman Tom Emmer announced late Friday that he will introduce a trio of cryptocurrency and blockchain related bills as cryptocurrencies fell lower this weekend after posting significant gains last week,142,9ii0m1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9ii0m1/us_congressman_tom_emmer_announced_late_friday/,2018-09-24 23:42:29," ### Crypto News * A research report authored by Weiss Ratings, a provider of market research on stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies, makes a bold prediction saying Bitcoin will lose half of its market share to Ethereum within five years. The research report cites that Bitcoin is a, one trick pony while Ethereums superior blockchain does not limit the cryptocurrency in any sense. After receiving some negative feedback from investors, Weiss Ratings clarified via tweet that they see an, Ethereum-like platform dominating the market  not necessarily Ethereum itself. * According to a report by Bloomberg, Brazils largest independent broker, Grupo XP, is launching a cryptocurrency exchange in the coming months. Grupo XP announced this move as Brazil may be on the brink of eased cryptocurrency regulations after Brazils regulatory agency announced last week it is investigating the countrys largest banks for allegedly halted the service to cryptocurrency related firms. Approximately 3 million Brazilians own cryptocurrencies while just 600,000 have holdings in stocks. * After Bitcoin developers reported of a patch in Bitcoin Core to fix a bug that could bring down a large chunk of the network, an official Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) report revealed that the bug was more serious than initially let on. According to the CVE report, an attacker could have exploited the bug to create new Bitcoin, thereby inflating the 21-million coin supply and devaluing current Bitcoins. Over half of Bitcoin miners have updated to the new software patch meaning users can no longer exploit this bug. * Cryptocurrencies and their blockchains have observed more down-time in 2018 than ever before. After Steemit, a blockchain-based blogging platform that pays content creator in cryptocurrencies, went down for multiple hours on September 17th, Coindesk released an article discussing the increased down-time cryptocurrencies and their blockchains have observed in 2018. Coindesks article details that new and innovative consensus protocols, such as varied versions of Proof of Stake, have contributed to causing increased blockchain downtimes due to experimental protocols and unforeseen issues with these experimental protocols. * Dubais Department of Finance (DoF) announced yesterday that it has partnered with the Smart Dubai Office (SDO) to launch a blockchain-powered government payment system. Reported by local news outlet, Zawya, the platform, dubbed, Payment Reconciliation and Settlement, launched yesterday and enables government entities to conduct real-time payments between each other and within government structures while providing more transparency. * Erik Voorhees, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift, said that the exchanges decision to begin collecting IDs from users was proactive and a necessary step to reduce legal risks. The decision came as Shapeshift was facing warnings from regulators to begin adhering to Know-Your-Customer regulations. * Ethereum developers and miners have come together to stop specialized mining hardware from operating on its network. After a new application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) was announced last Thursday, developers and mines have become vocal about ASICs effectively pushing out smaller miners from being able to operate. Members of the Ethereum community have called on developers to implement measures against ASIC mining in the Ethereum blockchain, as many believe ASICs can dominate a mining community and force decisions upon a coin. * Icelands cryptocurrency industry may be moving away from a mining focus and moving towards a pure blockchain focus. Halldor Jorgenson, chairman of Borealis Data Center in Reykjavik, told news outlet Red Herring that demand from local cryptocurrency firms is shifting more towards pure blockchain. Iceland has become a popular area for mining due to its cold climate and cheap electricity, however, Icelandic industry experts have cited that a blockchain focus is better for the long-term future. * In relation to the probe against Amit Bhardwaj and his alleged Bitcoin Ponzi fraud, Indian police authorities have seized USD$60 million of assets associated with the scheme. The Ponzi scheme was responsible for stealing roughly USD$5.26 billion from over 8,000 people. * Opera is launching a special edition of its Labs desktop browser today that will feature a functional built-in crypto wallet. Announced in early August, the special edition of Labs opened today for private beta testers. According to a blog-post shared with Cointelegraph, Labs will enable users to authenticate Web 3.0 and dApp transactions made on their computer using their Android phone. * Tom Emmer, a member of US Congress, is sponsoring a trio of blockchain-focused bills that aims to support the development and use of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. The first of the three bills addresses regulatory frameworks around cryptocurrencies and blockchain. The second bill ensures cryptocurrency miners would not be required to register as money transmitters. The third bill would protect tax payers in reporting revenue from tokens that resulted from a hardfork. Emmers announcement of these three bills came Friday, the same day he was named a co-chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus. **Sources:** r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL"
5,CVE,CryptoCurrency,AsicBoost and the strange case of CVE-2017-9230,5,8lxag7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8lxag7/asicboost_and_the_strange_case_of_cve20179230/,2018-05-25 09:41:47,"# About CVEs In the public interest of tracking and remedying cybersecurity vulnerabilities quickly, a public database was created in 2000: the CVE List [1]. CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. Its database records, known as CVEs, track and record publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each recorded vulnerability has a unique ID and lifecycle where it follows certain states. # The AsicBoost controversy In April 2017, Greg Maxwell published an email [2] on the bitcoin-dev mailing list which described AsicBoost - a patented optimization to the algorithm used in Bitcoin mining - as an attack on the Bitcoin protocol. There was much contention [3] about whether AsicBoost constituted some kind of harmful exploit, or whether it was merely a technological innovation which enabled more efficient mining hardware (ASICs). There were allegations, widely reported in media, that the patent served the interest of Bitmain [4]. The purported benefits of exploiting this patent as alleged by Core developers were contemporaneously disputed by other miners [5]. # CVE-2017-9230 raised against AsicBoost On 18 May 2017, Cameron Garnham posted to the bitcoin-dev list [6], urging for getting a CVE assigned to the perceived vulnerability. On 24 May 2017, this CVE was created as CVE-2017-9230 [7]. It was simultaneously published under Bugtraq ID 'BID 98657' at [8]. The justification in the CVE stated that the AsicBoost method &gt; 'violates the security assumptions of (1) the choice of input, outside &gt; of the dedicated nonce area, fed into the Proof-of-Work function should &gt; not change its difficulty to evaluate and (2) every Proof-of-Work &gt; function execution should be independent.' It seemed a plausible enough reasoning for the CVE to be assigned. It was entered in the list of Bitcoin-related CVE's at [9]. Detailed information on this particular CVE is still missing/incomplete on the wiki page, a year after the CVE was raised. # What happened since the CVE was raised If you've followed along, you've learned that the CVE was raised to counter the exploitation of the AsicBoost method by miners. Since then, however, a Core developer, BtcDrak, has been involved in the founding of a mining company, Halong Mining. Several online sources state his (part?) ownership of this company. BtcDrak has put forward a proposal [10] which would enable the use of AsicBoost within the Bitcoin Core software (the dominant client software on the BTC network). This proposal appears to directly contradict the CVE claims of how AsicBoost violates ""security assumptions"" of Bitcoin, and indeed does not address how it mitigates them, nor is CVE-2017-9230 referenced in any of its related documentation. While the proposal's specification [11] and implementation [12] have not yet been formally accepted, the situation is that Halong has shipped mining equipment which is now actively employing AsicBoost [13,14] on the Bitcoin (BTC) network. There is even a website showing the blocks where AsicBoost was used [15]. # Conflict of interest There a clear conflict of interest in the actions of the Core developer BtcDrak. His actions as a Core developer appear to be furthering his company's interests and competitive advantage in the mining industry by exploiting a vulnerability of which he must have been keenly aware, having participated on the same bitcoin-dev mailing list where it was discussed. The CVE was vociferously used to paint Bitmain as culpable for delaying Segwit (Bitmain was accused of using AsicBoost and blocking Segwit activation for their own profit motive - claims that Bitmain has publicly denied strongly and which were never substantiated). One might have expected a similar outcry against Halong's *proven* and *announced* use of AsicBoost, but the parties that had previously condemned Bitmain remained mostly silent. Only an anonymous non-developer, Cobra-Bitcoin, co-owner of the bitcoin.org domain, spoke out on the Github pull request in [11], and Core developer Luke-jr spoke out against the use of the proposal on the Bitcoin network while consensus had not been reached on it [16]. Subsequent discussion on the bitcoin-dev list on this topic since March has been minimal and only concerned with technicalities of stratum protocol changes. # The bigger elephant in the room It seems logical that either AsicBoost constitutes an exploitable weakness, and thus merits a CVE and measures taken to prevent its use on the Bitcoin network entirely. Or it is not a problem and the CVE should be invalidated. The Bitcoin Core project should use its consensus processes to arrive at a coherent decision. # Other problems raised by the use of overt AsicBoost The Halong implementation uses version rolling of the `nversion` bits of the header. It reserves a subset of those bits for overt AsicBoost. These bits are no longer available to BIP9, but there was no update of BIP9 proposed to address this impact. This is a question of sensible procedures being followed (or not). The author did not find any review comment mentioning the lack of BIP9 specification update, which suggest a lack of thorough review on a proposal which dates back several months. A minor issue is that the Core implementation warns when a certain proportion of unrecognized version bits are detected. This behavior can be triggered by the AsicBoost method used on the network. --- [1] URL [2] URL [3] URL [4] URL [5] URL [6] URL [7] URL [8] URL [9] URL [10] URL [11] URL [12] URL [13] URL [14] URL [15] URL [16] URL --- EDITS: 1. make dates unambiguous, make it clear that [5] disputes the benefits alleged by Core developers"
