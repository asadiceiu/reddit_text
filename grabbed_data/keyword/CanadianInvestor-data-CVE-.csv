I made a risky buy on CVE when it tanked and I'm currently up just about 100% on it. I was dumb and I honestly don't like investing in oil because of the..... volitility of it. I want to sell all of those shares and buy either xqq and vfv. Easy right just 3 trades (1 sell, 2 buys). Well the kicker is that I also own a whole bunch of mutual funds though a bank and I don't like the poor return and the frankly robbery MER. So if I sell all of those mutual funds plus the CVE then buy two index's we are now at 4 trades in a month. I could space out the trades by selling CVE and buying one index then next month sell the mutual funds and buy the other index. I would like some advice on how to best manage this transaction. Side note CVE has been doing what I believe is called a triple bottom and we are at the bottom of a trough and earning are coming out at the end of the month. Would it be reckless given the gain I have made to wait until earnings or just do the transaction I listed above. CVE is also about 25% of holding. I have most in TSFA and some in a self directed account. I only looking to sell the TSFA portion which is 66% of my total in CVE. Thanks for any input"

2,CVE-,CanadianInvestor,Roast my portfolio... any guidance would be appreciated!,2,hrcvgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/hrcvgm/roast_my_portfolio_any_guidance_would_be/,2020-07-15 09:49:21,"Hi, I know this is what I should pay an advisor for, but I would be very grateful if any of you would be willing to provide an opinion on my current portfolio, and offer suggestions about how I can move forward. I am young (32). I like equities and do not want bonds. I like the idea of all in one ETFs that rebalance automatically (VEQT), but I would also like to learn to manage individual stocks. I have a reasonable income 55000-70000 (gross), and am concerned that selling my current holdings will lead to taxes. I have three accounts (Non-reg &gt; TFSA &gt; RRSP). This money forms my inheritance. This money was held at an institution where I paid fees when transactions were completed. My advisors did not manage it actively, primarily because they did not get paid because I did not request changes (catch-22). It just sat. I have now moved to Questrade, but I am unsure how to change the positions I am currently in without making a mistake. My TFSA is easy... It is maxed, and is filled with cash (transferred in cash b/c mutual funds). I plan to DCA this money into VEQT because I am afraid to put it in all at once at this time. My RRSP is a small account with money set aside by a former employer. I tried to invest this money by choosing companies myself. I bought these companies thinking they were solid companies which I could hold long term, and earn dividends. I bought at the beginning of 2019, a peak. It has been a bloodbath, see: URL . Should I hold (wait for broader recovery) or sell the stinkers and move on? CM.TO, LNR.TO, HBM.TO, MAL.TO. I think I want to sell them and park what's left elsewhere, but CIBC may be undervalued, LNR may be undervalued, and HBM is volatile so might rise... MAL I have no clue. My Non-Reg is filled with many solid companies, but between my RRSP and my Non-Reg, I own every major bank. I own a lot of Canadian Oil (which I believe will face headwinds in the coming decade). I own some ETFs I bought with my own money prior to transferring and am thinking of selling (wait for recovery?). I will be selling my ETFs to go towards an all in one product. I am concerned about ONEX, CVE. AKT.A.TO is a total loss. I feel OVV is going the same way. See again: URL . My major concern will be selling stocks and incurring taxable gains, as I prefer to defer taxes when possible. Any help would be appreciated!"

In particular, I like the upside in some commodity driven businesses (energy, mining, power, utilities) as well as some industrials and consumer staples. I see major headwinds in financials, consumer discretionary, and real estate. As I have gotten more active with my portfolio over the past couple months I have been looking for deep value in my picks and am interested to share some thoughts and get some feedback on my strategy and holdings. To start I have an inherent bias towards energy, partially due to having a deep knowledge of the companies in the sector, but also as part of my longer view towards recovering commodity prices. My energy holdings right now are ARX, CVE, ENB, and PPL. I've done well on these in the short term and view them all as solid companies that will survive the downturn and have plenty of upside. They are my top picks across the complex (natural gas, oil sands, pipeline, and midstream) which I think is important for some level of diversity. I recently added CPX to my portfolio as a power producer given how much they were down in the short term and the relatively low impact the downturn looks to have on their forward estimates. With a current dividend yield &gt;7% that looks to be safe I view them as undervalued relative to some peers like AQN or NPI (both great companies). I like NTR as a company hitting multi-year lows but continuing as a market leader with a very good balance sheet. I view the 5% dividend yield as safe and think there is massive upside to a cyclical improvement in fertilizer prices. Similarly I added TECK as a high quality company hitting multi-year lows largely due to commodity prices (metallurgical coal, copper, zinc, oil). I think they have the balance sheet and assets to manage through Covid-related challenges and see significant share price appreciation ahead. I am also holding XGD as I like the broad exposure to the miners with upside to increasing gold prices. With my remaining cash I am looking for other value opportunities that align with my strategy for the next couple years without taking on too much risk. On my watch list is ATD, CP, FTS, and SNC. I'm interested to hear of some other ideas or critiques of my less than diversified portfolio."
9,CVE-,CanadianInvestor,"May 5, 2020 - Traders Edition",10,ge4z6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/ge4z6o/may_5_2020_traders_edition/,2020-05-06 06:05:02,"**Play the momentum  see everyone tomorrow.** Seriously though. SPY finished strong yesterday and had a good open and most of day. Oil has been super strong and continued its monster push. Oil names continued their crazy momentum and weak sectors remained weak. Now the questions turns to, how long can momentum continue before it moves to another sector? So I did a very unscientific eyeball test of daily charts from all the sectors I cover. When momentum takes over the average run is about 4 days with some lasting 7 days (gold miners push). I want to begin moving my trading style into letting plays run. I have often found the bottom of names, got my 2% and got out, only to have the stock run 10-15% more. Although today that play did not work (see REITS). Although I noted yesterday that they were a weaker sector so should have locked that in earlieranyways Im rambling, analysis time. **Energy and Oil Companies** - MEG Energy Corp, Crescent Point Energy, Cenovus Energy, CDN Natural Resources, Suncor Energy, Enbridge, Teck Resources Limited, Husky Energy Oil and futures up big. So now I need to start looking at individual names since all are doing their own thing and not moving as a sector. MEG  Wish I didnt let this one go so early. $3.44 is high of bounce in beginning of April. With momentum it looks like it should break. CPG  It didnt get the big V that most names got in March but its been slowly climbing since and it almost at the gap from the March drop. If we start filling its a good vacuum. CVE  Thought I was looking at the same chart again for a second, same as CPG CNQ  So although it definitely had more of a drop and V shape recover in March, it is actually looking similar to CPG and CVE, despite not getting as big of bounces recently. Although the weakness today shows potential for bear flag on daily. SU  See CNQ  similar set up ENB  similar set up to SU and CNQ but seems to have slightly more room to avoid bear flag. Teck.B  going to call this a failed equilibrium break but has support from past few days to act on HSE  of all the names this one is definitely doing its own thing. I think it has enough room to continue its 4 hour uptrend. **Gold Miners** - Kirkland Lake Gold, Kinross Gold, Barrick Gold, Eldorado Gold, IAMGOLD, B2Gold, Yamana Gold, OceanGold. I swear these names cant be weak for more than a couple hours. Started off red across board, finished green across board. Most looking like they will test highs from a week ago. **Marijuana Stocks** - Canopy, Aphria, Aurora, HEXO, Organigram. Cronos, and some US MSOs. Before the constellation warrant news, WEED was looking like it was heading back to $20 support. An even day with this much SPY green has me leaning bearish towards that support. **Banks** - BMO, RBC, Scotiabank, CIBC, Manulife, TD Weak sectors gonna be weak. You get a daily bear flag, and you get a daily bear flag. Everyone gets a daily bear flag! But seriously, watch for tomorrow to test low of yesterday. **REITS** - Brookfield, Smartcentres, Riocan, HR Real Estate Should have stuck with my normal trading game plan. My normal game play is to get my 2-3% and GTFO. I mentioned in the opening I wanted to change that since I often time the bottom right but then miss out on more of that 5% upside. So I set a sell order for $13.45 on BPY after my entry of $12.56. Well we got to $13.10 and dumped all day. So instead of taking what could have been 4%, I am now in the red. Still holding because [I have trend lines coming up soon]( URL but damn. Also, strength of the name did not help today. The weaker names got their oversold bounces and held up better. Looking at the daily, from a chart perspective, I like CAR first, BAM.A and HR., then BPY.UN after today and then SRU, REI, PLZ **SHOP** - Choo Choo. Hit ATH, pulled back towards EOD but nothing of substance of hourly to be worried about. Financials upcoming. Roll the dice if you want. EDIT: Just noticed SPY dumped at EOD and put downward pressure on a lot of names. Still held pre-market lows but will be interesting to see if we fill that gap after hours/pre tomorrow."

I made [two trades today seen here]( URL I sold MEG right at open and quick flip on IPL. I got in MEG yesterday at $2.30. My thought process was the gap up would bring me over 10%, we were gapping up outside Bollinger Band and short term RSI would be overbought. Thats all fine and dandy but it then proceeded to blast to $2.88 like a rocket. For those doing the math, that is $8000 I left on the table (had I timed the top perfectly which would never happen). When trading like I am, you need to stick to your guns, take the money when your levels hit, and move on to the next trade. There is always money to be made. Dont try and force a trade, dont wonder what if, and dont throw good money at a bad trade if the set up isnt there anymore. **Energy and Oil Companies** - MEG Energy Corp, Crescent Point Energy, Cenovus Energy, CDN Natural Resources, Suncor Energy, Enbridge, Teck Resources Limited, Husky Energy At 8am the price of oil was $11, my 9:30am it was $14.22. This caused all the energy names to gap up. I was looking at the 4 hour timeframes and its tough to give set ups for all names because each chart is doing something different. The larger energy providers (CDN, SU, ENB) have more tighter sideways equilibriums. MEG, CPG, CVE have the wilder swings. CPG and CVE just broke their equilibrium bullish and are headed back to their recent highs from April 9th. For all these names I would just play within their respective equilibriums using USOil and SPY correlations as a guide for short term price movement. **Gold Miners** - Kirkland Lake Gold, Kinross Gold, Barrick Gold, Eldorado Gold, IAMGOLD, B2Gold, Yamana Gold, OceanGold. You know whats worse than watching gold miners run every day  predicting every day that they will continue to see green and not grabbing a position. Gold miners continue towards their recent highs as expected. I dont see why Gold would stop its uptrend anytime soon so keep riding the momentum. **Marijuana Stocks** - Canopy, Aphria, Aurora, HEXO, Organigram. Cronos, and some US MSOs. As someone who used to play the days when these stocks would swing 20% over an hour, the liquidity and low volatility during this market is a killer. Minimal movement, tight equilibrium. Not even on my radar for trades. Ill let you know if something significant happens. **Banks** - BMO, RBC, Scotiabank, CIBC, Manulife, TD So although banks were green today (outside of RY that paid a dividend), the bounce on these names was very weak compared to the majority of names on my list. The [head and shoulders pattern still in play](URL which is short term bearish. Most of these dont have a support anywhere close if they do break bearish. That said, I would be surprised if we just broke bearish and headed to those supports. If we do break bearish, I will look for an entry before those supports. **Bombardier** - Oh look, $0.40 to $0.42. Shocking. **Air Canada** - I was watching a $16 to $19.24 range. The 4 hour has tightened up enough that I can now watch $17.07 to $18.53. **Blackberry** - $6 is a major resistance having failed to break on March 13th, 31st, April 17th and 18th. Holding its 12 and 26 day moving averages so far. Another one that is range bound and I wouldnt guess at an entry, Id wait and see if we break either way. Looks like it held $5.50 well all day. **SHOP** - We gapped up above the 50% FIB retracement ($868.18) yesterday which allowed it to act as support for the day. I think the size of the candle from yesterday is quite wide so we may trade within it for a while. So the first 10 minutes of today was wild with high volume and volatility. The rest of the day was very tight and low volume. Look at any daily chart and you will see that todays volume was like 30% - 50% of yesterday and way less than last week. It explains why we are tightening up on some of these names. Eventually these equilibrium will break and volume will pour back in."

There isnt going to be much of an analysis today because it was basically a nothing day. How can I say it was a nothing day when things are up 10%? It comes down to volume and volatility and both were absent today. Gilead Science came out this afternoon saying their drug was not showing any promise to fight the virus so SPY fell hard, went negative for 5 seconds and then bounced back green. Gold strong, oil strong. With all these strong names most gold miners, energy and oil names opened up green and then everything was just tight most of the day. Just so you can see what I am talking about, [here is CVE on the 15 minute timeframe]( URL There was a crazy 11% move over the first hour and a half. The next 3.5 hours had 3% volatility. [Here is Kirkland Gold]( URL  same thing we saw a 5% bounce in the first 30 minutes of trading and after the initial pullback we traded in a 2% range for the entire day. [Banks were even worse, here is Royal]( URL The range for the entire day was 2%. As a trader I need to see at least 30,000 to 50,000 shares on a 5 minute candle + volatility for me to be able to make a trade. As a trader I can never expect to hit the entire move but I look to hit 30% to 50% of it. 50% of a 2% range is 1% and that is if I hit everything perfect. So instead of going through each name and an in-depth analysis, here is summary for each sector. **Gold Miners**  should have bought 3 days ago, or 2 days ago, or yesterday when I kept saying ride the momentum and looking strong. I would expect them to top out soon since I dont think they will straight break old highs. I expect this top out to be tomorrow or early next week. **Energy and Oil**  oil names got big days because of big day from USOil. Energy names mostly flat. If you want volatility you play the oil names, if you want more safety, load up on the energy names. **Banks**  still think head and shoulders play out. Oil, Gold, SPY all green  banks were a mixture of red or slightly green. If markets consolidate (which I am guessing we see some red soon) they will pull back with it. Nothing else really noteworthy today. Hope for some fun tomorrow but Fridays usually have less volume so well see."

We pulled back and broke again at 2:40pm and managed to stay above the almost the entire afternoon but a really weak finished put us back down below. The other daily resistance is $288.52 but then there is a gap to $293. That would put us back to March 6th which was the start of the huge sell off. Quite impressive bounce from the bottom.

When they are doing well, oil and energy companies are less likely to fall forever despite what oil is doing. Today followed that pattern where we got weakness on open because of the oil drop but then global market strength propped them back up. CPG, VET, MEG, CNQ, CVE and SU all have [this same graph formation](URL We got a high of a bounce end of March/beginning of April, pulled back over next week/2, bounced to a lower high compared to initial bounce and are now pulling back to test that low. Basically as long as they hold that low, we are good. I am not one for trying to guess if/where we hold that support. You can make a play off those bottoms. **Gold Miners** - Kirkland Lake Gold, Kinross Gold, Barrick Gold, Eldorado Gold, IAMGOLD, B2Gold, Yamana Gold, OceanGold. I said on Thursday I expected some consolidation on these names soon before testing their recent highs. We were getting it on Friday before a market wide pump which caused these names to finish green. Today gold was red and these names saw some consolidation. Markets were strong again causing their pullbacks to be very minimal. Textbook bull flag on daily. If markets are strong again tomorrow and Wednesday I would expect a test of those highs. **Marijuana Stocks** - Canopy, Aphria, Aurora, HEXO, Organigram. Cronos, and some US MSOs. On Friday I said that WEED has a bunch of resistances coming up but if they go over 5% than they can run because that was the highest point from the bounce. They gapped up right near resistance, [broke the resistance line](URL and it was off to the races, finishing up 12%. Once they pulled back the first time and held above resistance it was an easy stairs up. Still in line with market direction but short term looking bullish after that break. **Banks** - BMO, RBC, Scotiabank, CIBC, Manulife, TD For over a week I said that these banks were setting up a head and shoulders pattern and a break was imminent and then we went sideways, and sideways, and sideways. Thanks to global markets which continue to push, the banks did not break and ended up building support at these levels. On Friday I changed my opinion and instead said let global markets dictate short term movement. Well another green market day and these banks all got some bounces. As I [look at a daily chart]( URL they are not out of the woods. If they continue to bounce I would watch the top of the right shoulder for resistance. Obviously the support established over past week is a must hold. Still, if you are holding banks this was solid to see after that support established last week. **Air Canada** - Nice 3% day but havent even broken the inside candle we have been trading in since April 20th. $19.24 next test. **Blackberry** - Similar to AC. Had a nice day and is heading back to test daily high of $6.07 from April 20th. $6 and $6.07 should act as double resistance. **SHOP** - SHOP tested their ATH on the open but failed to break and immediately started consolidation. Still no red flags on any of the medium to long term timeframes. If I were to play this I would look at $854.14but realistically Im not making a play until we get closer to $791. I know REITs did well today so if people can give me some tickers I can start following and add to my analysis."

After doing a fair amount of reading, I decided to start investing with a little bit of money through a TFSA and wealthsimple. Im willing to go a bit more high risk as Ill be playing with less money (that if I lose isnt a big deal). Ive been limiting my investments to Canadian stocks (TSX) to limit costs incurred. Im wondering what you all think of diversification within markets. For example should someone pick one big bank in Canada or get 2-3 different stocks. Currently, my profile looks like this: ~30% ETF stocks - all roughly 6-8%: VCN, TEC, ZUB, ZJO, ZWC 15% in Big banks: TD, CIBC and BNS (would it be smarter to just pick one bank and go with them??) ~13% AC - took a risk here when they were low last month 10% in energy: Enbridge, Suncor, CVE 10% in bell media (BCE) and Telus (T) 10% in BPY.UN ~7% in AW.UN and SRV.UN 5% in FTN Any tips for a new investor would be greatly appreciated!

22,CVE-,CanadianInvestor,"May 1st, 2020 Analysis - Traders Edition",1,gbpa4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/gbpa4u/may_1st_2020_analysis_traders_edition/,2020-05-02 06:04:56,"Gap fills come through. I mentioned yesterday that a lot of these names were looking at hourly gap fills. [Here](URL is an example of what I mean. When you look at the hourly chart you will see that when a name gaps up on open and continues to run there is usually an empty space (gap) that remains. 99% of the time, this gap will be filled at some time. I have no basis for that 99% outside of the fact that I have seen it play out thousands of times. We filled the gap on the majority of the sectors today. So now moving forward for what to invest in. Laggards vs. stronger names. The basis of the argument is that sectors move together. I agree with that. You will often find tech sector moving together, MJ, banks, oil, etc. If you open a daily chart on many of these names you will generally find most names in similar sector tend to move the same direction (outside of some unique names that will have their own movement). [Here is BPY.UN with overlay of REI.UN and HR.UN](URL [Here is TD with RY and BNS overlay](URL So although you may have some differences with picking the right horse, overall they move together. So with that basis, the question then moves to, if I want to trade/invest in a sector, do I get into the stronger name or do I get into a weaker one hoping that they bounce and catch up. When I first started trading MJ, I always played the laggard. Long story short, that move was right maybe 2 of every 10 times. The majority of the time you should just play the stronger name. [Takes me to my trades today]( URL I got into BPY.UN when they were dropping this morning and averaged down mid-day (thanks for the downward pressure Elon). From a technical perspective, hourly is not yet oversold and they have a lot of room before resistance. So why would I enter early when resistance is still another 7% away. First, I dont think we dump straight to resistance. That would be a fall of 18% in 3 days which, given the size of the bounce, is not likely. Second, I look to others in the sector  SRU.UN = near resistance and close to oversold on hourly; HR.UN = still about 5% from resistance but close to oversold on hourly; REI.UN = almost at resistance and oversold on hourly. My logic is that if these are too hold support/get a short term oversold bounce, they will bounce sooner than later. If they bounce, BPY.UN will likely bounce and since its a stronger name (from a chart perspective, although HR.UN looking good too), I would want to be holding it. So I am swinging into the weekend. That said, we did see a slight bounce end of day. More in sector analysis. **Energy and Oil Companies** - MEG Energy Corp, Crescent Point Energy, Cenovus Energy, CDN Natural Resources, Suncor Energy, Enbridge, Teck Resources Limited, Husky Energy Oil up today but futures were down. With futures down, SPY down, and the big bounce we had on these oil names, we got our consolidation. I see hourly gaps on CPG, CVE, MEG that will probably be filled and those are still 3%-5% away so I wouldnt be rushing for entries. The bigger companies like CDN Natural Resources and Suncor are starting to interest me. We have hourly gaps that still need to be filled but they are only about 1% away from being filled near the low of today. There are a lot of moving averages about 4% away. Could be a bottom fishing play in that area for a bounce. **Gold Miners** - Kirkland Lake Gold, Kinross Gold, Barrick Gold, Eldorado Gold, IAMGOLD, B2Gold, Yamana Gold, OceanGold. Cant hold gold down for long. Green for gold, green for the miners after initial pullback. We filled hourly gaps on some of these names but not all of them. I would say most of them still technically have an hourly downtrend so they arent out of the woods yet. There was a lot of resistance on gold in the $1715 range so I would expect to play equilibrium between that point and our low of today. **Marijuana Stocks** - Canopy, Aphria, Aurora, HEXO, Organigram. Cronos, and some US MSOs. Weed has my interest again. We bounced 22% over a couple days and have given it almost all back. A lot of support in the $20.50 range and then there is $20 psychological. If we open red on Monday I would be making a play off this support. **Banks** - BMO, RBC, Scotiabank, CIBC, Manulife, TD  Pro  we filled all of those hourly gaps I mentioned.  Con  We are closer to the support level (bearish) than we are to the resistance (bullish)  Pro  a lot of room in between both (3% to 4% to downside and 6% to 8% to upside). I would expect equilibrium short term. **REITS** - Brookfield, Smartcentres, Riocan, HR Real Estate I dont know if I need to go more in-depth here since I covered a lot in the opening. A lot of these names are either near resistance, close to oversold on hourly, or both. Given this I would expect a short term bounce is going. Absolute worst case scenario would be a pathetic bounce (1%-2%) that cools off RSI and then rolls over and continues to head down. As I was writing this it looks like we got exactly that at 2-4pm. We got a couple percent bounce and that cooled off the RSI on these names. That said, we are still holding support on those names. Holding the low of today on Monday will be important. On BPY.UN, we dropped 10% over 2 days, dont know if I could consider that a [bullish abandoned baby] (URL but it would look like that [if we bounce Monday](URL **SHOP** - See post from yesterday. We are still super tight overall. Would want more clarity before I played anything outside of short term bounces."

[EWJ](URL has 330 holdings but some companies with smaller market cap are just as important as the large ones. there are ETF's available with many holdings from different countries but i prefer to hold japan and europe separate. its just sad that these investment product only seem to hold ADR's of these companies listed on the NYSE. one fund for international exposure is really interesting [IXUS](URL - Ishares International ex.US When cutting out the 48% representation of US companies in world equity stocks, you get a nice mix of equity outside of a high risk US market. It does hold 6% in Canada but this is a way to get out of the US stocks to play the US in different funds. S&amp;P500 - [IVV](URL or [RSP](URL IVV holds the S&amp;P500 index fund while RSP is the Equal weight version of the S&amp;P500. RSP recently reduced their MER to 0.2% down from 0.4% and has outperformed IVV. there is less information technology involved and a higher weightage in other sectors like real estate so their is less risk of downturn. the range of market caps in the S&amp;P500 is from 750billion to 3billion. its hard for some to accept that a 750bill Apple will have the same weight as Under Armour. the true vision of equally weighted high cap companies is to buy in the middle and finish in the middle. upcoming companies will be inducted into this index like ATVI which has been successful after joining the S&amp;P500.

I'm reminded of it because [HLF](URL (Herbalife) is +11% right now. its a shocking story involving Bill Ackman. do you think bill ackman really means to give away all gains to charity using his investors risked money? I have belief in a company like [HydroOne H.to](URL to be an important holding for Ontarians. a similar company in the UK is [National Grid](URL which also has gas distribution as well. HydroOne has given praise to the Ontario liberals for giving them the opportunity to grow and acquire additional assets by allowing them to be publicly listed. underwriters received 243million for the sale of hydro one which some consider to be right from the pocket of tax payers. now that it is public on the market, we can choose to purchase it. long term we will have to pay for its distribution services and having exposure to it as well as a dividend would reduce the cost of the service. the dividend is not reinvestable :(."

46,CVE-,CanadianInvestor,American Lithium Corp (CVE: LI) suspends trading. Am I about to lose it all or make a profit?,3,5c83ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/5c83ox/american_lithium_corp_cve_li_suspends_trading_am/,2016-11-11 01:32:37,7 days ago American Lithium Corp (CVE: LI) suspended trading after announcing great mining tests at the Nevada property. I bought it at around $1 but the stock dropped and is currently at $0.34. I have hunted the discussion boards and other investors feel there is some big takeover/merger in the works and we will all profit or that the company is about to declare bankruptcy. It is very unusual for a stock to halt trading for an entire week. Does anyone else hold this stock or have any idea what is going on?
47,CVE-,CanadianInvestor,What are you going to buy this week?,6,4lk6wr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/4lk6wr/what_are_you_going_to_buy_this_week/,2016-05-29 22:04:35,I did some selling last week and I have enough cash in my brokerage account to do some buying. I am watching CAR.UN (Canadian Apartments REIT) if it gets under $30 for a buy and hold or PTK (Poet Technologies - it is on the CVE) for a short to medium term hold. What are you buying? What do you think of my choices?
48,CVE-,CanadianInvestor,Made an error and looking for some advice,2,2ukbr5,http://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/2ukbr5/made_an_error_and_looking_for_some_advice/,2015-02-03 09:00:09,"Hey Guys, Last year, I bought into [ZEN](URL last March at $2.67 on a tip that it would go to $6 in a few months (I know, I know). I did some preliminary research on sedar and it seemed okay and read some stockchase guys saying it was speculative and a long term play. The tip I got was that there was a buyer to bring this pure (talking 99.9% carbon) graphite mine to production (apparently the only other purity found like this is in Sri Lanka). Time went by and investors were promised the preliminary economic assessment in Q2 last year, then it kept getting pushed along (still not out yet!) and as a result (in my opinion) the stock price kept getting pushed down. So now I feel I'm in a bit of a spot, I've held this for almost a year without much positive or definitive news on the outlook of the company and I am currently ~45% down. I was thinking that I would sell half my position and deploy that capital in the O&amp;G sector where prices are down currently and will bounce back in the future (whether it is 1, 2 or 3 years down the road) and I will be well positioned in a low-debt company (thinking about RRX, WCP, CPG, VII etc.) that is artificially down by overreaction (in my opinion) from the sudden drop in commodity pricing. The other half would ride it out in ZEN until it's bankrupt or sold off. What are your thoughts?"
