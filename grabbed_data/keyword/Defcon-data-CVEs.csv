(BH),1,cngafj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Defcon/comments/cngafj/anyone_go_to_the_ssl_vpn_devcore_session_bh/,2019-08-08 13:56:27,I found it particularly impressive. They basically owned all the major SSL VPN vendors on the market. Im sure if they wanted to they could do it all over again after those CVEs were patched. Really makes you appreciate the only thing saving you in some cases is you are not an attractive enough target. I bet Cisco were sitting through that with sweaty palms.

They are here for the next hour or so to answers any questions you may have. With us today, we have the following individuals representing those Villages : ## Wireless : ## [/u/mellendic](URL - [/u/Zero\_ChaosX](URL # Welcome to the Wireless Village! The Wireless Village is a group of experts in the areas of Information, Wifi, and Radio Frequency with the common purpose to teach the exploration and exploitation of these technologies with a focus on security. We focus on teaching classes on Wifi and Software Defined Radio, presenting guest speakers and panels, and providing the very best in Wireless Capture the Flag games to promote learning. We are also one of two of the longest running villages at Def Con. Hack the RF!

However, in recent years, attacks have become trivially easy to exploit in any environment meaning that effective defense has been difficult. Defenders have to deal with legacy, politics, and resource constraints and typically have less public information on how to best protect their environment when compared to the red side. This leaves defenders at DEF CON feeling a bit left out with most, if not all, of the content favoring red. This village is a DEF CON paradigm shift providing an area where Blue Teams can gather, learn basic and advanced defensive techniques, swap war stories, and have fun. Blue Team Village (BTV) at DEF CON promotes defensive security knowledge and its dissemination throughout the greater DEF CON community. At the BTV, youll find valuable information on defensive security from the very basic 101-level concepts through the latest, most advanced techniques we can get past NDAs. We also have contests, so you can prove your skills in securing systems -- and perhaps even show some of those red teamers whats what. [URL [URL ## IoT : ## [/u/goopcat](URL - [/u/littlelis34](URL Organized by security consulting and research firm Independent Security Evaluators (ISE), IoT Village delivers advocacy for and expertise on security advancements in Internet of Things devices. IoT Village hosts talks by expert security researchers who dissect real-world exploits and vulnerabilities and hacking contests consisting of off-the-shelf IoT devices. IoT Village's contests are brought to you by SOHOpelessly Broken, the first-ever router hacking contest at DEF CON. The ISE research that inspired the SOHOpelessly Broken contests delivered 56 CVEs to the infosec community. Over the years at DEF CON, IoT Village has served as the platform to showcase and uncover over 278 new vulnerabilities in connected devices. Follow both ISE (@ISEsecurity) and IoT Village (@IoTvillage) on Twitter for updates on talks, contests, and giveaways.

E.g. [/u/defconama](URL would tag the defconama account in a post. As is the nature of reddit, when you ask a question you may get answers from a variety of other redditors in the thread. So make sure to check the username of the responder and that its the person youre looking for an answer from. "
