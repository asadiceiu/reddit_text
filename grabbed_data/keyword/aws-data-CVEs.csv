0,CVEs,aws,AWS Inspector Usage - How do you collate the findings?,1,hmotgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/hmotgk/aws_inspector_usage_how_do_you_collate_the/,2020-07-07 15:51:11,"I am wondering if I might be doing this the wrong way or is it this an expected situation that I now need to put in additional glue. I'm now getting findings in 10k mark as we add more legacy servers, so I am wondering at this scale what is the next step to collate these findings? \- As we add more servers, we are obviously getting increased number of findings (10k to 20k) - to the point where I am pushing the limits of Excel to collate and summarize the data. \- Excel been used as a stop gap to manually summarize the data while I continue figuring out how to automate the scan, collate findings and report part of this. \- I think the assumption as your scan and resolve more CVEs, hopefully the number of findings go down. But we have quite a number of legacy systems - so it will be a while. \- I am looking for a system where I view the Inspector findings per instance. Excel sheet worked fine but at scale this work work. Plus when we begin automating the scans Anyone have any suggestions?"

2,CVEs,aws,Sidechannel md_clear cpu flags not being passed to EC2 instances?,8,br38fl,https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/br38fl/sidechannel_md_clear_cpu_flags_not_being_passed/,2019-05-21 09:51:47,"I've stopped &amp; started my m5d.large EC2 instances to pickup the new microcode : 0x200005e. This is the latest rev of microcode released by Intel for Skylake CPUs per the May 14th, 2019 pdf. My instances microcode went from 4e -&gt; 5e and 5a -&gt; 5e.

Testing with spectre-meltdown-checker it fails on the latest side channel CVEs. Vmware had KB articles on how to update ESXI hosts &amp; cluster to make sure it pushes updated cpu flags. I had to do this on my in house Vmware cluster, and I get green across the board internally, but not in AWS. &amp;#x200B; While AWS has pushed the updated microcode, it doesn't appear (at least for me) they are pushing updated cpu flags to enable the OS to apply Kernel mitigation: &amp;#x200B; CVE-2018-12130 aka 'ZombieLoad, microarchitectural fill buffer data sampling (MFBDS)' \* Mitigated according to the /sys interface: NO (Vulnerable: Clear CPU buffers attempted, no microcode; SMT Host state unknown) \* CPU supports the MD\_CLEAR functionality: NO \* Kernel supports using MD\_CLEAR mitigation: YES (found md\_clear implementation evidence in kernel image) \* Kernel mitigation is enabled and active: NO \* SMT is either mitigated or disabled: NO \&gt; STATUS: VULNERABLE (Vulnerable: Clear CPU buffers attempted, no microcode; SMT Host state unknown) &amp;#x200B; cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep micro microcode : 0x200005e microcode : 0x200005e &amp;#x200B; cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/mds Vulnerable: Clear CPU buffers attempted, no microcode; SMT Host state unknown &amp;#x200B; What am I missing?"
