Updates to [Anchore.io](URL include: The updates made to the previous Navigator service include: - Private Repositories: Allowing you to setup private repositories to be scanned by Anchore. - A Graphical Policy Editor: The new graphical policy editor allows you define your own custom policies and map which policies are used with which images. The policy editor supports CVE whitelisting - allowing a curated set of CVEs to be excluded from security vulnerability alerts. - Expanded Notifications: In addition to image update notifications the Anchore Navigator can now alert you by email when CVEs have been added or removed from your image and when the policy status of your image has changed, for example an image that previously passed is now failing policy evaluation. Your feedback would be extremely helpful, so if you have a minute head over to [URL and take a look Thanks!"
