0,cybercrime,security,Phishing Attacks: Why Energy Companies and Utilities Are Getting Zapped,1,e6puol,https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/e6puol/phishing_attacks_why_energy_companies_and/,2019-12-06 10:39:43,"*Editor's Note: This blog post was originally found on the* [*Agari Email Security blog.*](URL URL *By John Wilson* The Wall Street Journals report that a dozen US-based utilities were targets in a recent [wave of coordinated phishing attacks](URL should set off alarm bells throughout the sector and beyond. Energy producers and utilities dont just keep the lights on. They play a unique role in a countrys critical infrastructure, encompassing economic health, public safety, and national securitymaking them appealing targets for state-sponsored hackers and saboteurs. For years, hackers linked to Russia and Iran have probed for weaknesses in energy and utility cybersecurity defenses around the world. Among their top prey: oil and gas producers, nuclear power companies, and electrical grid operations. And in nearly every instance, their strategies have included phishing emails targeting the weakest link in most organizations security: humans. Organizations hit by a continuous barrage of phishing attacks often face an expensive, high-stakes problem thats hard to solve with traditional email security practices. ###### Phishing: Rising Costs, Serious Risks The average annual cost of cyberattacks was $17.84 million per utility company in 2018, according to Accentures 2019 Cost of Cybercrime Report. Thats a 16% jump from 2017. Energy companies saw average annual losses rise to $13.77 million. Yet bad as it is, the consequences for successful email attacks on energy producers and grid operators can easily eclipse remediation costs. Government and cybersecurity company investigations have shown that state-sponsored attackers have spent years phishing for nuclear reactor technology, login credentials for power plant control engineers, and other sensitive data. The fear is that successful phishing campaigns could have serious consequences for the organizations that fall victim, as well as for the constituents and communities they serve. Its a valid fear. A 2017 report, for instance, found that one group of threat actors had successfully phished their way into US and European energy companies, gaining [hands-on access to power grid operations](URL In other words, they had the ability to shut off the lights in the countries these organizations operated. Why didnt they? We dont know, but analysts are concerned that the attackers are holding on to that information to exploit latermaybe at a time of international turmoil. Utilities are vulnerable to other types of email-enabled sabotage, too. A 2018 report from Aon describes a plausible scenario involving a [phishing attack on a hydroelectric dam contractor](URL Ten days after stealing employee credentials and accessing the dams control network, attackers could open all the floodgates all at once, causing catastrophic flooding. ###### Email Attacks Go Nuclear Energy companies and utilities operate advanced technology, and security has been a major issue since long before cyber-espionage was a glimmer in Putins eye. How are state-sponsored attacks getting around security controls? Sophisticated social engineering tactics delivered via email In the case of the US grid hack, investigators say conspirators linked to the notorious Dragonfly hacker group emailed [New Years Eve party invitations](URL to energy sector targets. They also sent emails with industry-centric content to get targets to open attachments that would exfiltrate the victims network login credentials. Last October, the US indicted seven Russian intelligence operatives for a phishing attack on Westinghouse Electric Companys nuclear power operations. In that case, phishing emails directed victims to a [fraudulent Westinghouse website hosted on a lookalike domain](URL and designed to collect employees login credentials. According to the Justice Department, the attack appears to have played a part in technical reconnaissance aimed at gaining access to IP addresses, domains, and network ports. In another phishing attack on US nuclear facilities reported in 2017, [criminals posed as jobseekers sending resumes](URL to plant control engineers. The resumes contained credential-harvesting malware that the attackers apparently hoped would give them access to safety and operational systems. Thankfully, the FBI reports that the perpetrators were only able to access business and administrative networks. That hack of the US grid that took bad actors all the way to operational access? It didnt start with an attack on power companies. Instead, the hackers targeted utility companies vendors and partner email systems. Once trusted email accounts at those organizations were successfully infiltrated, they were used to launch email attacks designed to dupe power plant employees into downloading documents and sharing sensitive information. And its getting worse. In 2019, there has been a spike in spear-phishing attacks on US oil and gas businesses. Investigators suspect Iran is the culprit behind one email campaign targeting executives with a [fake job recruiting message](URL impersonating the White House Council of Economic Advisors. Clicking the link would lead to the installation of malware like the kind that has struck Middle Eastern oil and gas installations in the recent past. Considering Irans track record of targeting companies like Saudi Aramco for data destruction, the current phishing campaign is a major concern for US fossil fuel producers and refiners. ###### Keeping Imposters Out of the Inbox In all these cases, attackers rely on the simple fact that people are highly susceptible to well-timed email messages that appear to be sent by people they trust. Old-school secure email gateways (SEGs) and first-generation advanced threat protection (ATP) products arent designed to filter out these advanced email attacks. As a result, individual employees are left to make snap judgment calls about the safety of the messages in their inbox. By contrast, modern email security solutions analyze incoming email based on past sender behavior and a host of other signals to identify messages that are authentic and trustworthy. Using our own solution as an example, [Agari Secure Email Cloud](URL applies advanced data science and real-time intelligence from trillions of emails to ferret out attempts at identity deception and block incoming phishing and other socially-engineered email assaults. In the event a phishing email slips through and is detected post-delivery, the solution contains it and even removes it from all the organizations inboxes automatically. As it stands now, Lloyds of London estimates that a single, [coordinated phishing attack](URL against power plants, utilities and other critical infrastructure could lead to $193 billion in losses worldwide. Which means energy and utility companies may find theres plenty of incentive to deploy solutions to protect against state-sponsored phishing attacksor risk getting zapped into major losses of their own.

1,cybercrime,security,The Threat Taxonomy: A Working Framework to Describe Cyber Attacks,3,dlpz77,https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/dlpz77/the_threat_taxonomy_a_working_framework_to/,2019-10-23 09:49:29,"*Editor's Note: This blog post was originally found on the* [*Agari Email Security blog*](URL URL *By Crane Hassold* Imagine going to the doctor and only being able to say pain or sick. You cant say where you feel the pain, or what type of pain, or what is making you sick. Without this information, it is nearly impossible for the doctor to know how to treat you. From a cybersecurity perspective, this is very much like calling every email attack a phishing attack or even a hack. It limits the ability to identify proper countermeasures, and it frustrates meaningful comparison between potential approaches. With cybercrime on the rise, threatening individuals, enterprises, and governments, it has become vital for the security industry to establish a common way of talking about the problem. It is our responsibility to enable organizations and their information security teams to clearly convey their concerns and request guidance matching their needs. To address this need for a common language, Agari has developed a classification system for types of cyber threatsa threat taxonomythat breaks down common email attacks in terms of how they are carried out, and what the attackers wish to achieve. At the same time, this taxonomy serves as a guide for enterprises and organizations with a need to enunciate their security concerns and priorities. While the taxonomy is not in any way limited to Agaris solutions, it is currently limited to attacks leveraging email or other types of messaging. URL The threat taxonomy describes communication-related threats from various perspectives or dimensions. It starts by considering the *classification* of the message: Is it a malicious message? Or is it simply an unsolicited message such as spam or grey mail? Next, the taxonomy looks at *sender authenticity.* If the sender is not who they say they are, is that person using an imposter email address, a compromised account, or a temporary account? Using these two dimensions alone, many of todays common threats can be described in a straightforward manner. Additional dimensions detail the sender identity, recipient, threat delivery, and motivation. As an in-depth description of the threat taxonomy is beyond the scope of this post, we can instead provide an overview of certain aspects that many of our customers have expressed an interest in. We do this by describing two common types of email-based attacks using the taxonomy: [business email compromise](URL (BEC) attacks and targeted attacks using compromised accounts, known as [account takeover-based](URL (ATO) attacks. ## The Threat Taxonomy and BEC Attacks BEC attacks were virtually unknown a few years ago, but have since risen to become one of the most prominent email-based threatsthe FBI estimates these attacks are responsible for more than [$26 billion in exposed dollar losses](URL over the last five years. This dramatic rise can be explained from several perspectives. One is that it is a *targeted* attack, meaning that the volume is low and the individual variation is relatively high, making the use of methods based on blacklisting largely irrelevant. This means that traditional security technologies simply dont apply, leaving most mail systems vulnerablewhich means, in turn, that the malicious emails will be delivered. A second reason is that these attacks take advantage of existing workflows and mimic business-as-usual conversations, making them instantly credible. In one common version of a BEC attack, the criminal simply creates a free webmail account and sets the display name to match the party he or she wishes to impersonate. Since reputation-based email filtering methods will typically deliver all emails from webmail accountsexcept those that have been observed to spew millions of unwanted emailsmalicious BEC emails are almost always delivered. And since most users, even when being careful, rarely look further than the display name when determining who an email is from, this type of identity deception is successful. ### Taxonomy of a BEC Attack URL Now, lets use the threat taxonomy to restate what we just said: Consider the first dimension of the taxonomy: classification. Since BEC attacks are inherently malicious, this is an easy one. Next, the *sender authenticity* can be an imposter, since these attacks commonly use display name deception. However, we have kept all our options highlighted here as BEC can take any form of sender authenticity. Looking at *sender identity* and *recipient*, we know that these emails are typically sent from a trusted source, such as an executive or partner, and they are sent internally to employees. Next, *threat delivery* showcases a response-based email. While typical [consumer phishing emails](URL contain URLs, and many [ransomware](URL attacks have attachments, cons like BEC attacks have neither as they typically look to receive a response from their target. As such, they are commonly harder to detectespecially for security vendors that use the approach of blacklisting URLs or attachments known to be bad. Turning to the last dimension of the taxonomy, *motivation*, it is clear that the BEC attacks of today are either aiming to steal funds (financial) or data (theft or destruction). A common type of data that BEC criminals aim to steal is W-2 data and/or other personally identifiable information. ## The Threat Taxonomy and ATO Attacks While the account takeover-based attack is relatively uncommon, it is increasing dramatically in commonality due to its abilities to circumvent all traditional countermeasures, whether the technique is used to infiltrate victim organizations, plant ransomware, or steal sensitive data. This is because if the criminal uses compromised accounts as launchpads to attack the contacts of the users whose accounts were compromised, the intended victims receive emails from people they have interacted with in the past. Typical security solutions implicitly assume that this is good email trafficalmost independently of the content of the emailwhich means the malicious emails get delivered. And if the attack is crafted in a cunning manner, the users receiving these emails believe these messages are secureand either open the attachments or follow the instructions that they would have ignored if the email came from a stranger. The most common type of email compromise involves a user getting phished. For concreteness, lets say that Alice receives an email that looks like it comes from her email provider, and it instructs her to log in, maybe under the premise that unwanted access attempts have been made such as in the 2016 [John Podesta](URL attack. As Alice logs in, the attacker steals her password. The attacker automatically searches Alices email communications and determines that Alice interacts with Bob, a very wealthy businessman. And now, the attacker sends an email from Alices account to Bob, saying Sorry about the long wait! I just realized that I never got around to sending this. Talk to you soon!  and then attaches a file, that when opened, will put ransomware on Bobs computer. ### Taxonomy of an Account Takeover-Based Attack URL In this scenario, the *classification* of Alices email is malicious since the attacker is using it to wreak havoc on Bob. The *sender authenticity* is a compromised account since this is an actual account used by someone Bob knowssomeone with an internal/coworker *sender identity*. Since this is ultimately a ransomware attack, the *threat delivery* is payload-based with a *motivation* of financial gain. ## Using the Threat Taxonomy In conclusion, there are many different email-based attacks. Their similarities and differences are best understood by breaking down the nature of the attacks, which can be done using the taxonomy we describe above. We have shown how to describe two important attacks using this taxonomyBEC attacks and ATO attacks. These, of course, are just two examples. As [cybercrime continues to grow](URL well uncover new ways that criminals use email to target their victims, and continue to update this taxonomy. *To learn more about how to stop BEC attacks, check out the Agari Advanced Threat Protection* [*simulated demo*](URL "
2,cybercrime,security,Whitelisting Won't Protect You From BEC... Here's Why,1,d623je,https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/d623je/whitelisting_wont_protect_you_from_bec_heres_why/,2019-09-19 04:37:48,"*Editor's Note: This blog post was originally found on the* [*Agari Email Security blog.*](URL URL *By Armen Najarian* The [250% increase](URL in business email compromise (BEC) scams over the past year should concern every organization, as should estimates of [$26 billion in losses](URL over the last five years from these attacks. While some organizations consider whitelisting their email lists to provide protection, occasionally encouraged by their email security provider, this strategy simply will not work with the ever-evolving email landscape. Executive spoofing, spear phishing, and other advanced email threats have emerged as a critical issue for businesses everywhere, despite being relatively new to the scene. [Ninety-two percent of organizations](URL report being hit, with 23% suffering direct financial damage. According to the recent Verizon Data Breach Investigations report, 94 percent of all successful cyberattacks start with email sent to a well-targeted victim  resulting in average losses of [$1.6 million.](URL When an attack leads to a data breach, that figure climbs to an average [$7 million per incident](URL With all of this as a backdrop, its easy to see why a security model designed to only allow emails from trusted domains and IP addresses to reach employee inboxes would be tempting. Unfortunately, such whitelisting-based solutions are wishful thinking at best, and actually harmful in many circumstances. Here are just three of the reasons this approach could leave organizations wide open to attack. # #1 DMARC Can Only Do So Much Whitelisting is typically accomplished by augmenting secure email gateways (SEGs) with a database of legitimate domains derived from Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance ([DMARC](URL which is an important email authentication protocol that enables sending and receiving infrastructure to exchange information in order to ferret out emails sent from spoofed or look-alike domains. While DMARC has significant benefits, organizations using this approach must register every last possible permutation of each domain they own. Otherwise, there is nothing to stop fraudsters from registering those domains first, and even setting them up with legitimate DMARC records. Their emails would then be sent from trusted domains, despite being controlled by the fraudsters. Its not as hard as you may think. And given that only [17% of the Fortune 500](URL have a DMARC record that would block illegitimate email from reaching the inbox, whitelisting based strictly on DMARC authentication results would block legitimate mail from the vast majority of established businesses that have yet to implement a DMARC record. # #2 You Cant Just Black Out the Cloud Cybercriminals are increasingly leveraging Gmail, Yahoo, Microsoft Office 365, and other cloud-based email platforms in order to bypass security models based on trust. After all, its not as if organizations can simply blacklist [gmail.com](URL or [outlook.com](URL since they also send massive amounts of legitimate email. [In these schemes](URL fraudsters set up free accounts and simply insert the name of a trusted individual or brand into the From field. Since their point of origin is an established and widely used hosted email service, these identity-deception based attacks would fly past whitelisting -based security controls. Whats more, by exploiting a Gmail feature that enables them to create countless variations of an email address with the same account, cybercrime groups are able to scale their attacks with ease. One international [BEC ring weve been tracking](URL for instance, used this approach to register for 14 trial accounts with a commercial sales leads service to collect data for launching new attacks, and to submit 48 credit card applications for at least $65,000 in credit. Whats more, despite the security controls built into hosted email platforms, businesses that have migrated email to the cloud increasing rank among [the hardest hit by BEC](URL Whitelisting-based approaches could leave businesses wide open to this kind of attack. # #3 Low-Tech Strategy Needs High-Tech Defenses While most BEC scams are relatively low tech and involve only one or two personalized sentences designed to trick the target, a high-tech approach is needed to combat them. Since BEC scams masquerade as regular emails, cybercriminals can quickly and easily change tactics as they find new ways to trick their victims. A whitelist approach is static and would require constant updating in order to combat against this, populated by information that is only available once an attack hits the organization. And putting in measures to combat an attack after it has already happened is akin to stopping a leak once the house has flooded great for prevention, but unable to fix the current mess. # #4 Compromised Accounts Could Crush You According to data captured in [our latest trends report](URL phishing and BEC scams launched from the compromised accounts of trusted individuals and brands are now used in 16% of all advanced email attacks. A key driver for these attacks is the growing availability of stolen email login credentials on the Dark Web. Once a corporate email account has been taken over, cybercriminals have access to all of its owners contacts, ongoing email conversations, and historical email archives. In most cases, fraudsters use these compromised email accounts to launch phishing campaigns. Other times, the goal is to fool corporate employees into forking over [their own login credentials](URL which can then be sold online. In the most sophisticated cons, however, an intruder infiltrates a corporate email account and then lays low, [surveilling email messages](URL in order to launch highly personalized attacks on the businesses customers, partners, or employees, at just the right moment. In fact, that was the case with at least some of the nine publicly-traded companies that recently [lost $100 million through BEC scams](URL # Its Not the Domain, Its the Identity As BEC, phishing, and other threats grow more prevalent, its clear that approaches based on whitelisting (or blacklisting) are predicated on a failed security paradigm that attempts to block known bad signals  in this case, untrusted domains. But attackers know how to evade these protections, which is why some take a more modern approach. [Agari Advanced Threat Protection](URL for instance, leverages data science and real-time, anonymized intelligence from 2 trillion emails annually to map email communications across individuals, organizations, and infrastructures in order to model the trusted, authenticated behaviors that define each individual senders good. When email activity deviates from these established patterns due to impersonated or compromised accounts, businesses are able to detect and protect against these attacks in real-time. No whitelisting required. *To learn more, check out a special report from Agari and Osterman Research entitled,* [*Best Practices for Protecting Against, Phishing, Ransomware, and BEC Attacks*](URL"
3,cybercrime,security,Social Engineering: The Weapon of Choice for Email Scammers,5,cuh2t1,https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/cuh2t1/social_engineering_the_weapon_of_choice_for_email/,2019-08-24 03:32:01,"*Editor's Note: This blog post was originally found on the* [*Agari Email Security blog.*](URL URL By John Wilson The recent Internet Crime Report from the FBI [showcasing the growth of business email compromise (BEC)](URL from a $700 million problem to a $1.3 billion problem over the course of only one year was certainly alarming. It showcases just how much cybercrime is growing, despite increased defenses across organizations worldwide. But one key element stands out for methe fact that none of these attacks involve malware or malicious links. The fraudsters weapon of choice continues to be plain-text email messages, and theyre clearly becoming more successful. These emails rely on identity spoofing and social engineering tactics to manipulate recipients into wiring millions of dollars by making them believe they were reacting to a known and trusted sender. Though its true that some email attacks still include phishing links or attachments with spyware, ransomware, or any kind of -ware you can think of, it is the criminal use of human psychology in simple, innocuous-looking email messages that is quickly becoming the number one cybersecurity threat to businesses and consumers alike. ## Double Trouble with BEC But how can this really be possible? How can smart people be fooled into revealing sensitive information or wiring money (and apparently lots of it), simply by receiving an email purporting to come from a known business or individual? Youd be surprised. For one thing, were not talking simple spam here. Today, networked cybercrime rings produce emails that can be so well researched and so exquisitely targeted that they can be virtually indistinguishable from messages sent by a trusted colleague or brand. Adding to the impersonation? Ploys such as display name fraud, look-alike domains, and, when possible, previously compromised email accounts that can be used to easily defraud their prey. Sometimes, it even involves meticulous grooming over weeks or even months as fraudsters gain the trust of unsuspecting employee or consumer targets. As a whole, these efforts appear to be well worth the effort. ## Angles of Attack with Social Engineering Today, a typical business email compromise campaign will snare its first victim in just under four minutes[,](URL often with queries about a past-due invoice or updates to payment details. More recently, weve seen criminals asking for gift cards, which are typically easier to obtain and less likely to raise alarm across the organization. Sometimes, these social engineering schemes entail a late-afternoon message purported to come from a top executive, but [recent research](URL shows that they typically arrive in the morningoften as employees are just settling in for the day. Because they are sent right as employees are sitting in traffic on their way into the office, criminals are effectively increasing the odds the recipient will read the message on a mobile device. Why? Because most mobile email clients display only the senders name as a defaultnot the email address. Recipients pressured to act quickly while late to the office may react to messages that appear urgent without thinking to confirm legitimacy. The SEC report makes clear just how financially remunerative these rackets can be. In fact, according to the FBI, more than $13 billion has been pilfered through such cons since 2013. But this isnt the only email problem impacting your business. ## Fast Money, Long-Lasting Effects from Email Scams Phishing attacks targeting consumers typically involve impersonating well-known brands from a variety of sectors. Consumer packaged goods, media, retail, fast food, real estate, banking, government, and just about any other industry you can imagine can be leveraged as the bait in a phishing scam. Here too, social engineering is central to success. By projecting urgencyPassword Check Required, Your Payment Has Been Declined, or Security Alert, for instancethese emails are designed to fool recipients into responding quickly before facing some perceived consequence. Last year alone, [consumers lost $172 billion](URL through these and similar online scams. When it is your brand that gets impersonated, victims often unfairly blame your company, sharing their outrage on social media. Even when a customer hasnt been personally duped, publicity about cons bearing your brand name can mean theyll be hesitant to open the next email you actually do send. And with these scandals living on Google for years, its not easy to put the past behind you, even when extra security measure have been taken to prevent it from occurring again. Not only can victims face financial ruin, but the ripple effect can also have serious repercussions to your bottom line. Among other things, it can hobble marketing efforts in a channel thats 40 times more effective at generating revenue than any other digital medium at your disposal. The impact can be long-lasting, despite your best efforts to move forward. ## Traditional Email Security Isnt Enough Unfortunately, while traditional secure email gateways (SEGs) and other email security solutions are generally quite good at ferreting out malicious links and malware, they havent proven effective at countering fraud attacks that are primarily propelled by social engineering. Instead, some organizations are finding they need to deploy [artificial intelligence-based technologies](URL that apply behavioral analytics to understand the relationships between sender and receiver to detect and prevent socially-engineered email attacks. As for protecting customers? That can be even harder. While many organizations have implemented the Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) standard that can help recipient systems spot brand impersonators, only [12% of the Fortune 500](URL have set up the DMARC policy parameters needed to do this effectively. Organizations across the FTSE 100 and ASX 100 show even worse numbers. Emails attacks continue to be a money-maker for cybercriminals because organizations continue to be powerless against them. It is only my implementing the tools available as part of the next-generation [Secure Email Cloud](URL that we can protect against themno matter which tactics they use and who they plan to target. It is time that organizations worldwide take proactive steps to protect customers and employees alike with solutions that combine machine learning and globally crowdsourced threat intelligence to defeat sophisticated con artists. Otherwise, these cybercriminals will rob us all blind. *To learn more about how the next-generation Secure Email Cloud is changing the game for cybersecurity,* [*download an exclusive report*](URL "
4,cybercrime,security,"Businesses Grow More Vulnerable to Email Attacks, Even with Improved Defenses",1,cevqni,https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/cevqni/businesses_grow_more_vulnerable_to_email_attacks/,2019-07-19 03:47:19,"*Editor's Note: This post can originally be found on the* [*Agari Email Security blog.*](URL &amp;#x200B; URL *By Patrick Peterson* &amp;#x200B; Cybercriminals increasingly use new forms of identity deception to launch an email attack to target your weakest link: humans. Call it a case of locking the back window while leaving the front door wide open. Throughout the last year, a number of reports have surfaced about sophisticated cyberattacks that are proving all too successful at circumventing the elaborate defenses erected against them. Firewall? Check. Application security? Check. Endpoints? Those are covered, too. Yet despite the millions organizations spend each year on perimeter security, the bad guys are still winning. In 2018, [cybercrime losses exceeded $2.71 billion](URL in the United States alone. But how can this be possible? How can businesses grow more vulnerable even as their defenses harden? As it turns out, 97% of organizations are failing to effectively leverage modern technology to protect against the number one target cybercriminals use to implement their schemeshuman beings. Indeed, whether its the [Marriott breach](URL that exposed the personal information of up to 500 million people or the 12 million patient records stolen through the [Quest Diagnostics breach](URL cyberattacks tend to have one thing in commonthey almost all involve identity deception perpetrated against specific individuals. And that means they almost always start with email. ## Mission Impersonate for Data Access The fact is, email is still the most popular tool for business communication and collaboration. But most email security systems are falling short in protecting organizations against fraud. Today, up to [94% of data breaches](URL start with an email reaching a well-placed target. And while you may think this number is excessively high, were not talking about the typo-laden phishing email attacks of the early 2000s. Cybercriminals now produce flawlessly crafted messages capable of deceiving virtually anyone. Theyve also come to understand something far more critical to their successyoure much more likely to be fooled into disclosing sensitive information or downloading dangerous malware if youre reacting to a trusted colleague or someone you wish to impress. Take the current trend in file-sharing email fraud. According to CSO, cyberthieves are increasingly leveraging information from social media to target corporate employees and then posing as colleagues and sending them file-sharing [phishing emails from OneDrive](URL and other popular cloud services. Embedded links within the emails lead recipients to fake sign-in pages, where theyre prompted to enter their personal credentials. Attackers then leverage those credentials to hijack the real accounts of victims, where they can steal valuable information, access contact lists, and launch ever-more devastating attacks. The problem is that most email security solutions cant detect this kind of fraud because the login page is hosted on a compromised website with a good reputation. ## Advanced Email Attacks: Personalized &amp; Pernicious Most identity deception-based email attacks increasingly follow a similar playbook. First, they [leverage popular cloud services](URL in order to make infrastructure reputation less reliable. After all, its not as if organizations can simply blacklist the likes of Google or Microsoft, since they also send a large amount of legitimate email. Second, they appear to come from identities and brands the target trusts. Think simple display name ploys, where fraudsters insert a trusted identity within the from field within Gmail and Yahoo so it appears to be legitimate. Or domain spoofing, which involves displaying a legitimate email address, which is possible when organizations do not secure their brands from cybercriminals. But thats not all. In a look-alike domain email attack, criminals substitute say, [invoices-acme.com](URL for an actual domain, like [acme.com](URL to send fraudulent invoices. And then there are account takeover attacks, which originate from legitimate (but compromised) accounts and are notoriously difficult to detect since there is little indication that the emails are not who they say they are from. Whatever the technique, the highly personalized messages within these emails are designed to be indistinguishable from everyday business emailrendering traditional content analysis ineffective. The goal is to manipulate the recipient into taking some action or disclose some piece of information that they assume will be safe, and unfortunately, they are more successful than wed like. Stemming the tide of such attacks wont be easy. ## Securing the New Perimeter Against Phishing Attacks Security awareness and phishing training can [help employees detect some of these new forms of email attacks](URL But the quality and sheer volume of new email schemes mean that will only go so far. And yes, [Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC)](URL can help stop domain spoofing and brand hijacking. But 97% of companies have yet to set up policy parameters to optimize effectiveness. But even then, this doesnt protect against all the attacks that target employees and partners. Its also unclear how many organizations are deploying machine learning technologies with the kind of modeling and analytics capabilities needed to go beyond content analysis and infrastructure reputation to assess people, relationships, and behaviors and put an end to the identity deception-based email attack. As it stands now, there probably arent enough of them. Cybercrime is only continuing to increase as criminals become smarter, so we must be prepared to take a stand against them. All this to say, we better hope more organizations move beyond just securing that back window on the perimeterand stop the endless stream of identity-based email attacks flowing through their front door. &amp;#x200B; *To learn more about identity deception and the rapidly evolving threat from email attacks, download our report on the* [*latest trends in email fraud*](URL "
5,cybercrime,security,Dealing with the Global Threat of BEC Attacks as Cybercriminals Go International,0,cjvoy9,https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/cjvoy9/dealing_with_the_global_threat_of_bec_attacks_as/,2019-07-31 04:14:06,"*Editor's Note: This blog post was originally found on the* [*Agari Email Security blog.*](URL URL *By Patrick Peterson* Business email compromise (BEC) attacks are still a prime tool in the arsenal of cybercriminals when it comes to committing fraud and stealing large sums of money. While BEC phishing attacks have been[ big news in the United States](URL recently, advanced email threats are a very serious problem globally. Private businesses and public institutions across the globe must be vigilant towards the threat that BEC attacks pose. According to Verizons [2019 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)](URL BEC is still advantageous for the criminal element precisely because it provides a quick way to cash out. Other types of cybercrime require work on part of the adversaries to convert stolen data into accessible wealth. Meanwhile, BEC requires only that someone responds to an initial email and believes the person on the other end long enough to fulfill his request. This is especially true as [gift cards become a more popular mechanism for cybercrime](URL likely because they are easier to acquire and harder to track. Interestingly, the 2019 Verizon DBIR notes that 18% of clicks made through to phishing messages came from those using mobile devices. We live in a world where people are often on the go  answering work emails from airports, cafes, or while picking up their kids from soccer practice. The hurried nature of such instances may make professionals more susceptible to BEC attacks, particularly because they may not be as vigilant in examining each email as if they were on a desktop computer in the office. Its just another factor to consider when defending against BEC schemes. # International Incidents Take Center Stage It doesnt take much to see that this problem is an international one. There have already been warnings that Russian hacking groups are targeting government, media, and political organizations across Europe as part[ of a cyber espionage campaign](URL ahead of upcoming elections. Specifically, targeted spear-phishing campaigns are the opening gambit for the attacks, according to ZDNet, with fraudsters sending spoofed emails to their intended victims with links that appear to lead to legitimate government websites. In actuality, these links are malicious and plant malware onto the computer of those affected. Also in recent months, attack group London Blue has resurfaced and,[ as we have previously noted](URL is using legitimate commercial services to mass harvest target data for their phishing campaigns. This type of activity has resulted in a master targeting database containing the contact information of more than 50,000 financial executives. The same can be said for cybercriminal organization [Scattered Canary](URL which used Lead 411 to find their targets  both in the United States and elsewhere. # Financial Services and Healthcare Remain Prime Targets While financial services and healthcare are the two most-targeted industries in the US, little changes once you leave North America. An upsurge in phishing messages has been targeting customers of DBS Bank in Singapore. The messages purport to come from the bank and feature links to sites where they are then asked to enter bank account details, victims would soon[ discover that payees were added to their bank accounts](URL and unauthorized transactions were made. Criminals are increasingly utilizing social engineering tactics on users and tricking employees at financial firms into providing their web-based email credentials. Another common method of attack? Compromised accounts, which are notoriously difficult to trace, as cybercriminals use the legitimate accounts of employees to give an aura of authenticity and send phishing emails to colleagues. Healthcare remains another highly targeted vertical. This isnt surprising because, like finance, it has access to a treasure trove of data that criminals would love to get their hands on. Hackers commonly use BEC attacks to get healthcare professionals to click through a link to a phony site that asks them to enter their email credentials. And once this has been done, the criminal then can gain access to any number of sensitive emails containing patient information. # International Defense Parameters are Critical Businesses in every geography are at risk of critical breaches and financial loss due to email phishing attacks. And they continue to be among the most frequent types of cybercrimes perpetrated against them Thats why its so important to have the proper defenses in place to prevent business email compromise and related attacks from being successful. This starts with proper employee education, but even all the training seminars in the world wont fully prevent phishing schemes from tricking users from time to time. Instead, [next-generation technology](URL that combines machine learning with advanced analytics can spot, flag, and prevent fraudulent emails from even reaching the inboxes of employees  enabling them to focus on less on cybersecurity and more on their work. It is clear that this threat isnt going away anytime soon.

6,cybercrime,security,You are the Reason Why your Customers are having their Identity Stolen,8,bmiqbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/bmiqbb/you_are_the_reason_why_your_customers_are_having/,2019-05-09 21:42:03,"Corporations today have to verify identities and gather personal information from their customers. This has become easier through identity solutions, which provide businesses a great way to find, process, and verify the information. While gathering information from customers has become easier, this has also led to a rise in identity theft. # What is Identity Theft? Identity theft happens when someone acquires personal identity information through illegal means, which could include your name, bank account information, and social security number. Hackers can then use this information to commit crimes or fraud in your name. Identity thieves or hackers are becoming more prominent now, and it seems as if [no corporation is safe from a hack](URL Identity theft not only damages the customer, but also the business because they lose all credibility in protecting their customers. Which is why the blame for it solely lies with the business. You are the reason why your customers are having their identity stolen, since you acquired that information and guaranteed protection against this information falling into the wrong hands. # What Can Businesses Do About It? Identity theft and organized cybercrime is on the rise and there are criminal gangs that have started pumping millions into creating sophisticated scams. They hire hackers from around the world and create sophisticated malware that can bypass the security measures of any business. Not even giants like Sony, Facebook, HBO, and Netflix are safe from these hacks as evidenced in recent times. Identity theft has become a global business, and the criminal gangs financing it, have no intention of stopping these hacks on all major and small businesses. Profit is the biggest motivator for these hackers to steal identities and it is up to the CEOs of businesses to protect the personal information of their clients and customers. However, they dont seem to be bothered to improve security because this means another expense and a major chunk out of their profits. Financial institutions dont even discuss the problem of identity theft with customers because they know that they have no plan to stop hackers from stealing valuable information and using it to commit fraud. This is sending the wrong message to customers, who are now hesitant to share information which could very well be stolen and used against them. Businesses need to own up to their shortcomings in dealing with international hackers and cybercrime, but they dont want to do it because that would make customers nervous and they will lose all credibility. # Going About It the Wrong Way Businesses think that if they admit they are powerless to protect their customers, it would destroy their credibility, but multiple studies have revealed that by talking and working with their customers, these [businesses can help brand themselves](URL better. The small business community is going about it the wrong way by not assuming any responsibility. The business owners dont consider customer protection and consumer data protection as a priority and this is the wrong attitude to have. To make matters worse, identity thieves and hackers already know about this attitude and they use it to their advantage. They know that check verification is very flimsy and most retailers cant afford the technology to protect vital information about customers. Businesses are still failing to take charge of security and arent enforcing stricter verification and authentication procedures because they think it will annoy customers. # What is the Responsibility of Businesses to Prevent Identity Theft? Every person must assume some responsibility for protecting their personal information to combat identity theft but businesses have a huge role to play when it comes to responsibility. Any business that asks customers for personal information, (which is nearly every business in the world), needs to assume complete responsibility to protect that data and prevent it from getting into the wrong hands. They should have a strict company policy to protect data, and they should update their technology to ensure protection against malware that is designed to steal this information. **Here are some other steps that businesses must responsibly take to prevent identity theft:** 1. Ensure Secure Computer Systems When the company collects personal information from a customer, after conducting a business transaction, they should take all the measures necessary to protect that information. They can do that by using secure websites, which can be identified, and have the latest data protection technology available. The company should also limit the amount of information that is at risk of exposure, and set up firewalls to protect consumer data. They should update their servers and computer systems regularly and have multiple layers of encrypted protection on every database. 2. Smart Information Retention Companies can stop identity theft from happening by limiting the amount of information they take when completing a transaction. They should also limit the amount of time they keep that information, and should only store the data they require to complete that transaction. Taking information like the social security number, or other personal information is not required, and shouldnt be kept by a company, because if that information gets into the wrong hands it wont benefit anyone except cyber criminals, who will damage the reputation of the business, and the customers identity."

15,cybercrime,security,Cyber security: Fraud rises as cybercriminals flock to online lenders,15,5z98n4,https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/5z98n4/cyber_security_fraud_rises_as_cybercriminals/,2017-03-14 12:27:50,"Cybercrime is becoming more automated, organized and networked than ever before, according to the ThreatMetrix Cybercrime Report: Q4 2016. Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting online lenders and emerging financial services, says Vanita Pandey, vice president of strategy and product marketing, ThreatMetrix. [ Related: 8 tips to defend against online financial fraud threats ] ThreatMetrix's report is based on data drawn from its ThreatMetrix Digital Identity Network, which analyzes about 2 billion transactions per month for insight into traffic patterns and emerging threats. The network uses a real-time policy engine to analyze transactions  about 44 percent of which originate from mobile devices  for legitimacy based on hundreds of attributes, including device identification, geolocation, previous history and behavioral analytics. ThreatMetrix's data shows 1 million cyberattacks targeted online lending transactions throughout 2016, Pandey says . It estimates the total value of these transactions at about $10 billion. It expects the number of attacks to continue to grow in 2017. Indeed, the number of attacks specifically targeting alternative lending increased by 150 percent quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016. That doesn't mean criminals have stopped targeting banks: ThreatMetrix says it detected 80 million attacks using fake or stolen credentials during 2016 in the finance sector alone. It should be noted that attacks are increasing both in number (ThreatMetrix says it detected and stopped nearly 122 million attacks in real-time in the fourth quarter, an increase of more than 35 percent over the previous year) and in proportion: growth in attacks outpaced overall transaction growth, and the overall rejected transaction rate grew by 15 percent. [ Related: Online card fraud up as thieves avoid more secure chip cards for in-store payments ] ""Fraud has evolved from being like robbing a house to being a big heist on a bank or institution,"" Pandey says. Increasingly, she explains, cybercriminals are stealing identities and using them to create accounts that they allow to sit and mature, sometimes for years, before leveraging them for crime. First, she says, criminals buy, trade and augment stolen identity credentials from any of the numerous data breaches that occur with increasing frequency. ""Most of us have been breached, whether you've stayed at an InterContinental Hotel, or you had a Yahoo account or you have a LinkedIn password you haven't changed in four years,"" she says. Those credentials are then used to create new accounts with retailers, banks and e-lenders. E-lenders are frequently targeted, perhaps because the criminals see them as softer targets than more established banks, according to ThreatMetrix. ""They will then use automated bot attacks on a new site to create an account for you,"" Pandey says. ""If it doesn't exist, they'll create an account. If it does, they'll bring in sophisticated tools to crack your password. They'll let an account sit and mature for a while. Once your identity has been verified, a lot of times you won't be stepped up or challenged. Imagine if I have a stable account, I've been transacting for two years nicely and then I use my account to buy a big item and change my address, they may not flag that."" Pandey says ThreatMetrix sees a lot of fraud being committed with accounts that have five or even six years of credit history and a big credit file. Even victims who regularly check their credit reports may not pick up on the fraud, as the criminals take care not to damage their victims' credit ratings until the accounts mature. ""Due to its surge in popularity, and fast transaction cycles, online lending has become a prime target for cybercriminals,"" she says. ""Online lenders are under increasing pressure to adopt smarter authentication methods that leverage real-time, behavior-based intelligence to accelerate genuine loans and prevent fraud. This is the only way to thrive in an increasingly competitive market."" **Developing countries becoming bigger players in online fraud game** This type of fraud isn't limited to the U.S. and other developed nations. ThreatMetrix says it has seen this type of fraud originating in developing countries including Brazil, Egypt, Ghana, Jordan, Nigeria and Macedonia. [ThreatMetrix](URL also reports a significant increase in attacks, particularly identity spoofing attacks, from emerging economies including Tunisia, Ukraine, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Serbia, Morocco, Guadeloupe, Qatar and Cuba. ""The fact that developing nations are becoming bigger players in the online fraud game demonstrates the spread of breached identity data to countries across the globe,"" Pandey says. ""One in four transactions on our network is now cross-border, illustrating a global village economy that's continuing to take root. Global data breaches are making stolen identity data globally available via the dark web, and this information is traded by organized and networked crime rings."" **How to keep the online digital world safe** With cybercriminals becoming more ambitious and more sophisticated, Pandey says it's becoming clear that text-based authentication needs to be deprecated. In fact, she says, any static information used for authentication that must be stored by a company is susceptible to a data breach and therefore an outdated way of thinking about secure authentication, identity verification and fraud prevention. ""It is becoming increasingly clear that the only true way to keep the online digital world safe and secure, (and processing transactions in the manner that technology-savvy consumers expect), is by analyzing the digital identity of every online user, an identity that is built on dynamic, shared intelligence harnessed from sources far wider than the individual companies a user transacts with,"" the ThreatMetrix report says. **Behavioral analytics and machine learning are the keys to making this work.** ""It is only by using this holistic, crowdsourced approach to digital identities that companies can be more confident of accurately differentiating fraudsters from genuine customers,"" the report concludes. ""In the case of Yahoo, the cookies might have been forged, but the online footprint of those fraudsters would have been markedly different to the genuine users, and it is up to Yahoo to be able to detect that in order to protect sensitive customer data.""
