2,cyber crime,AskReddit,[Serious] Do you believe cyber-bullying is mostly a first-world problem?,2,3p2ebs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3p2ebs/serious_do_you_believe_cyberbullying_is_mostly_a/,2015-10-17 12:59:34,"So, there was an hour-long speech about cyber-bullying at my school yesterday. All they were saying the whole time was, *""don't say mean insults online, treat others with respect, don't call each other stupid""*. Instead of focusing mostly on why people shouldn't post verbal insults online, I think not enough teachers/adults are encouraging kids to get unaffected by people's opinions. They never told us to just ignore someone's comment. If someone posts a threat online, then you have to tell the cops. But apparently, telling someone that they're a dumbfuck via internet can also be a legal crime. Do you think teachers should begin to focus more on telling kids not to get so offended easily?"
