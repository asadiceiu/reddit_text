While BEC phishing attacks have been[ big news in the United States](URL recently, advanced email threats are a very serious problem globally. Private businesses and public institutions across the globe must be vigilant towards the threat that BEC attacks pose. According to Verizons [2019 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)](URL BEC is still advantageous for the criminal element precisely because it provides a quick way to cash out. Other types of cybercrime require work on part of the adversaries to convert stolen data into accessible wealth. Meanwhile, BEC requires only that someone responds to an initial email and believes the person on the other end long enough to fulfill his request. This is especially true as [gift cards become a more popular mechanism for cybercrime](URL likely because they are easier to acquire and harder to track. Interestingly, the 2019 Verizon DBIR notes that 18% of clicks made through to phishing messages came from those using mobile devices. We live in a world where people are often on the go  answering work emails from airports, cafes, or while picking up their kids from soccer practice. The hurried nature of such instances may make professionals more susceptible to BEC attacks, particularly because they may not be as vigilant in examining each email as if they were on a desktop computer in the office. Its just another factor to consider when defending against BEC schemes. # International Incidents Take Center Stage It doesnt take much to see that this problem is an international one. There have already been warnings that Russian hacking groups are targeting government, media, and political organizations across Europe as part[ of a cyber espionage campaign](URL ahead of upcoming elections. Specifically, targeted spear-phishing campaigns are the opening gambit for the attacks, according to ZDNet, with fraudsters sending spoofed emails to their intended victims with links that appear to lead to legitimate government websites. In actuality, these links are malicious and plant malware onto the computer of those affected. Also in recent months, attack group London Blue has resurfaced and,[ as we have previously noted](URL is using legitimate commercial services to mass harvest target data for their phishing campaigns. This type of activity has resulted in a master targeting database containing the contact information of more than 50,000 financial executives. The same can be said for cybercriminal organization [Scattered Canary](URL which used Lead 411 to find their targets  both in the United States and elsewhere. # Financial Services and Healthcare Remain Prime Targets While financial services and healthcare are the two most-targeted industries in the US, little changes once you leave North America. An upsurge in phishing messages has been targeting customers of DBS Bank in Singapore. The messages purport to come from the bank and feature links to sites where they are then asked to enter bank account details, victims would soon[ discover that payees were added to their bank accounts](URL and unauthorized transactions were made. Criminals are increasingly utilizing social engineering tactics on users and tricking employees at financial firms into providing their web-based email credentials. Another common method of attack? Compromised accounts, which are notoriously difficult to trace, as cybercriminals use the legitimate accounts of employees to give an aura of authenticity and send phishing emails to colleagues. Healthcare remains another highly targeted vertical. This isnt surprising because, like finance, it has access to a treasure trove of data that criminals would love to get their hands on. Hackers commonly use BEC attacks to get healthcare professionals to click through a link to a phony site that asks them to enter their email credentials. And once this has been done, the criminal then can gain access to any number of sensitive emails containing patient information. # International Defense Parameters are Critical Businesses in every geography are at risk of critical breaches and financial loss due to email phishing attacks. And they continue to be among the most frequent types of cybercrimes perpetrated against them Thats why its so important to have the proper defenses in place to prevent business email compromise and related attacks from being successful. This starts with proper employee education, but even all the training seminars in the world wont fully prevent phishing schemes from tricking users from time to time. Instead, [next-generation technology](URL that combines machine learning with advanced analytics can spot, flag, and prevent fraudulent emails from even reaching the inboxes of employees  enabling them to focus on less on cybersecurity and more on their work. It is clear that this threat isnt going away anytime soon. Organizations around the globe need to stay one step ahead of the constantly evolving criminal landscape. *To learn more about how identity deception is tricking unsuspecting recipients, download our* [*latest report on trends in email fraud*](URL"
1,cyber-crime,security,Looking for content ideas - Anything you want to know about phishing/social engineering but never asked?,2,8xd4dd,https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/8xd4dd/looking_for_content_ideas_anything_you_want_to/,2018-07-10 02:11:11,"I'm looking for some content ideas and for things that I may assume people understand/are aware of with reference to phishing and social engineering attacks, but really aren't. I'm constantly surrounded by phishing and social engineering information and love to share my knowledge, but sometimes assume too much about what folks already know. Likewise, are there things you learned that blew your mind? For example, a very popular Business Email Compromise attack (BEC) involves redirecting escrow funds to an attacker-owned bank account. This is usually a product of a successful credential phishing attack, but the attacker stay quiet until the account number is sent for the funds transfer, they then follow up quickly with an ""account correction"" email from the actual victims email account, thus sending the funds to the new account. Attackers may stay silent for a month or two just monitoring activity and waiting to send that message. In DC I was doing some talks to some House subcommittees and a Secret Service guy said he just worked a case like that where $500k was redirected. A decent payday for a month or two of work :) A lot of folks I talk to don't know about this type of attack, or the fact that some cyber insurance won't cover this as it was an individual that transferred the funds (they try to put it under the ""crime"" policy instead, which also may not cover the ""willful act"" of the employee transferring the funds.)"
2,cyber-crime,security,I think I experienced a cyber crime while employed in a major sports league and need help understanding what happened.,14,8xmr9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/8xmr9t/i_think_i_experienced_a_cyber_crime_while/,2018-07-10 17:51:09,"This turned out longer than I initially planned -- sorry in advance for the essay. The main reason I'm posting this story is because I want to figure out what really happened. I still have the system logs, network activity, Slack conversations, and several screenshots from the night I mention. I don't know how much of it is relevant, but if there's something in there that someone with iOS or network security can decipher, I would want to talk to them, if only for my own sanity. There are things that happened here that are my own fault, and due to my technical naivety. I'm just looking for advice on what my options are and to understand the situation, not a reprimand for the poor decision-making. About 2 years ago, I was working at a media/tech company under the umbrella of a major sports league when this happened. The league's tech side (~2000 people) acquired the software company I worked at (~50 people) in fall 2015. This was my first job right after college in summer 2015 and I was officially hired as the merger was announced. I work in UI design, and my software and IT knowledge was lacking at the time. I was bringing my personal macbook to the office, and doing most of my work through there for a few months. After the company was acquired, I continued to do so. My work laptop was several years old and too slow for Adobe software that I was using daily. Around late spring of 2016, I started noticing unusual behavior on my work laptop. Recent searches appearing that I never typed, new Spotlight search recommendations like Activity Monitor and Network tools, apps accessed that I never use, files opened that I rarely access. One example is with the Dropbox app - my personal account was connected to my work computer, and I noticed my selective sync settings kept changing to sync my personal folders, which I explicitly made sure to exclude. I had to keep changing them almost daily. I ended up staying late one Friday night to try to fix it. I thought changing my work computer permissions would stop it, and surprise, it stopped working after that genius idea. I still had my personal computer with me, which I started using at that point. I pinged a coworker on Slack who confirmed that the company does indeed have remote access to our machines through Meraki, and that he uses Little Snitch to block access. He sent me the link to it and I downloaded it. He suggested I boot the work laptop into single user mode to fix those permissions and sent some links to help. At this point, it's 9pm and there's a dev who's also staying late. I tell him what's going on with the permissions and all and he sends me other links, and tells me to run those commands to fix it. None of them work or really change anything. I attempt to call our company 24/7 IT support but it goes to voicemail. I message a few more people on Hipchat, but no one can really help. Eventually, I drive directly home. Once I get home, I see this Little Snitch tool constantly pinging me on my personal machine, but can't recall what the notifications said. I changed some of the settings, which might've have opened some kind of door. Windows start popping on my screen for system settings and I hear that apple lock sound open, which I quickly click to counteract. Essentially, I go into panic mode and start defending my computer against all these attacks which are happening seconds apart. Notifications that looked inauthentic and almost like a fake Apple UI with blurry icons keep popping up requesting my password, which I try to exit from (relevant later). At some point in the night, I booted into recovery mode and saw what looked like another drive, or some kind of connection, that was accessing to my computer. I could see their recently viewed files and saw that my Dropbox folder was being viewed. The only folder I was was able to see in their directory before they disconnected was called Power Management. I tried to create a Firmware password but I think it was too late at that point. The password I setup wasn't even letting me in. When I called Apple after the Firmware lockout, they asked me if my operating system was bootleg, and doubted the authenticity of my operating system. I end up taking it to the Apple store that day and I remember the CS agent sounding genuinely concerned on the phone. I have no idea why they would think my operating system was inauthentic and I can't really explain how that would happen. I got in the office late that following Monday and was really distraught after messing up both my work and personal computers. The IT guy gave me a loaner machine to use in the meantime. I am still seeing the activity I saw on my original work machine that prompted my suspicion in the first place like the recommended Spotlight searches of network activity files and Activity Monitor that never came up in the past. I end up looking into system logs and console activity and not really understanding what I'm looking at, but I still save it. It starts getting really late at this point, like 2 am and I am there alone. And this is the really fucked up part when I start to hear noises throughout the office. Two women talking to each other like they're having a conversation. They're whispering to each other, and I can't make out what they're actually saying, but it's loud enough that I can hear it. I start walking around the office trying to find where it's coming from, but I can't find the source, as I'm the only one there. After going back to my computer, I realize what's going on right now is that there is someone actively mirroring my display and viewing my screen via an Apple TV or other possible connected devices. At just the right moment, I'm able to change settings and see their their desktop, completely different from mine. It quickly goes back to my screen as they disconnect. I also realize there's a remote connection via a Mac Mini, and I was able to view their widgets screen. None of this would ever on this computer before. As I walk back to my desk, I see one of the employees walking away in the distance towards his house, the same guy who sent me links on changing permissions. At this point it's 7am and the receptionist is making coffee. I start to hear people talking again coming from an office near the main door. As I walk towards this office, the receptionist enters through the main door, and is walking towards me in the opposite direction. There is a burst of laughter, very loudly and clearly, from that office I'm about to walk into. The receptionist and I both look at each other and I say explicitly, ""You heard that, right?"" and she confirms that she did and we both see no one there. I go back to my desk and see the first dev arrive. When I walk away from his area, I hear the first voices I heard of the women. This time, I can clearly hear her say, ""Is she gone?"" and when I approach, the dev is just standing over someone's empty desk responding when there's no one else there. Like he's speaking into a mic or something. I wonder if this was all just a sick prank and if this all of those sounds were being sent on some kind of speaker. There is much more that happened afterwards regarding HR, an attempt to escalate the issue, and verbal harassment until I had no choice but to quit. All of this raises some very disturbing questions... although management is allowed to monitor employees, at what point does it become malicious behavior? And who was it that kept viewing mirroring my display when I was there that night? I believe what was happening in my situation was malicious. What I'm asking in this post is how would one go about proving this in various system logs, what do I need to show, who would I even talk to to confirm this? For instance, when I saw the screen change to the mirrored desktop, is there a specific process I can look at in system logs to show this was happening? It seemed like whoever was remotely connecting was not part of the IT or management, who I assume would have those types of privileges. And even then, I doubt how ethical it is to cast someone's screen on an Apple TV, as opposed to using the proper software. To me, this seems like a crime, and I want to know how to prove that. I'm not sure if this is the proper subreddit for this story, and looking for all the help I can get, so I'll be posting to similar channels as well. TLDR: While working at my former job, I experienced remote connections to my computer. I saved log files and online conversations and want to understand on a technical level what happened and who I can talk to about this."
3,cyber-crime,security,Question about MAC addresses,1,8imzd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/8imzd9/question_about_mac_addresses/,2018-05-11 21:26:00,"Here's something I don't fully understand. So please just tell me if I'm missing something or get something wrong. I get that a MAC address uniquely identifies your computer's hardware and it can be used to identify you. When you visit a website, they have your IP address which you can hide with a VPN. This obviously isn't foolproof since I've seen webRTC being able to get your actual IP if you have JavaScript enabled but for the average person, it'd be fine. But when you look at all of these guides for being more secure online, they always talk about IPs but never mention MAC addresses and if they do, it's only in passing and is something like ""Kali Linux comes with a tool called MACchanger if that interests you"". What I don't get is, people make a point of spoofing their MAC address but this only seems to be when they're going to commit a cyber crime of some sort and I really don't see many people doing it just to be more secure like when they use VPNs to mask their actual IP. So is it pointless to try and coverup your MAC address, as someone not looking to do anything illegal? Do websites not have access to it even though you're using a VPN? I mean, if you were to use a VPN but did nothing to hide your MAC address, would that be a security flaw? Who can see your MAC address? The same who can see your IP? I remember Snowden saying that the government can track us using our MAC addresses but I guess it's pointless to try and hide yourself from the NSA since you'd probably lose unless you've got a 400 IQ.

I have post across a number of similar subreddits. Over the coming weeks/months I will be conducting a research project (around 15-20k words) to conclude my information security masters. At present I have a few high-level ideas of subjects that interest me, mainly surrounding either cyber/info sec risk management or cyber crime. I dont however know how I could build on them to the depth of 15k+ words and what exact hypothesis/avenue to take. I have quite thoroughly browsed pages such as this and popular blogs, but am still lacking that direction I need. Below are a few ideas, I would welcome any further suggestions or expansions. Please note, I do not have a strong technical background. Thanks! - The idea that cyber risk management needs to move away from a compliance based approach (such as outdated frameworks and un-agile working) to a more pro-active approach (that approach I am not entirely sure on!) - The need for risk management to become automated e.g. dashboards and real-time metrics to allow an enterprise level understanding of threats and risks. Meaningful data and information, rather than bloated paper based inefficiency. - The motivation behind young people becoming cyber criminals (although this may be more of a criminology / psychology subject rather than info sec) - The idea that cyber crime is undermining the digital economy (erosion of trust in, and growing fear of, digital technology) - Understanding your supply chain and the complex connectivity - Blockchains potential impact on security &amp; privacy (however my limited technical knowledge may be an issue) "
6,cyber-crime,security,Danish police have developed a method to identify individuals using bitcoin on the deep web,17,6ucmpx,https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/6ucmpx/danish_police_have_developed_a_method_to_identify/,2017-08-18 06:05:02,"The following is a translation i made of page 20 and 21 of [this document](URL by the danish police. I did my best with the translation, hope it's alright. **TL;DR:** Danish police have found a way to identify individuals using the Bitcoin currency on the deep web. They have shared the information with the FBI, DEA and all Europol countries, and probably some more. They expect to be able to take down international drug syndicalists, (thats what they said) using this new method. A couple of danish individuals have already been arrested for purchasing drugs on the deep web. **Introduction** Danish police was remarkably surprised, when they last year could present Europol to a breakthrough in IT, that makes it possible to identify criminals who trade with narcotics and weapons on the dark web. So far the criminals have been able to successfully hide their footprints by making use of the digital currency Bitcoin, but thanks to Danish police that is no longer a risk-free method, as proven by two sentences from Denmark. The police-hiveminds curiosity and understanding of connections combined with the scientists thoroughness and deep insight. That was the cocktail necessary to reach a breakthrough in the hunt on criminals, making illegal transactions on the internet and paying in the digital currency Bitcoin. The discoveries have been shared with the Europol-countries, FBI, DEA and more. Our main focus is to get the method spread to every country in the world, so we can finally start chasing the international criminal syndicates. We dont want to shine in Denmark alone, because we know how we can breathe the criminals on their neck, on the Dark Web, says Kim Aarenstrup, central leader for the National Police Cyber Crime Center (NC3). **High-teach team at work** Not long ago, police research came to an end if the criminals were using bitcoins when they traded illegal goods, typically on the Dark Web. The police didnt have the necessary knowledge or tools to identify who were behind the transactions. Even though the indices could be strong against one specific individual, the necessary proof couldnt always be raised in court. After a meeting in Europol in 2015 about bitcoin, the central chief Kim Aarenstrup returned with a smile on his face to his high-tech team in NC3, consisting of a mixture between police-people and IT-people. On the meeting in Europol, Kim had been presented to a model that was able to analyze and find connections between transactions with bitcoin  so-called blockchains. Though without being able to identify who was behind the transactions. - I asked my people to take a closer look at the method. They scratched their necks and then proceeded to go in-depth and research the topic, says Kim Aarenstrup. The police- and IT-people was by cooperating able to further develop the concept, beyond the already existing software-tools on the market, among others some analytical tools. - It is technically very advanced, but I wont try to explain the technical details of the method, because that would mean helping the criminals, Kim says with a smile on his lips.

[Financial Fraud Action](URL UK (FFA UK) is urging consumers to be vigilant against fraudsters tactics and pause before clicking the buy button, ahead of shopping bonanzas Black Friday and Cyber Monday when retailers offer an array of limited time offers and discounts. It found 31% of people who buy goods on the internet are more likely to take a financial risk, such as shopping on an unfamiliar or unsecure website, if they see an offer which appears to be a bargain. FFA UK said this means 15 million online shoppers could be putting themselves at risk of financial fraud, if the findings were projected across the UK. People aged between 16 and 34 are most at risk, the research suggests, with almost half (46%) saying they are more likely to take a chance, compared with just 18% of people aged 55 or over. Criminals use scam emails, fake ads on social media or internet searches promising heavy discounts for desirable goods to trick people into visiting fake websites and entering their card details. Once fraudsters harvest this information, they use victims details to go on shopping sprees. The survey of more than 1,900 online shoppers was carried out as part of a campaign called take five  which is backed by major banks and financial services providers. The campaign urges people to pause for thought before making financial decisions, and not to feel under pressure to act quickly. The research also found more than one in five (22%) online shoppers say they never check the authenticity of an online retailer, such as by looking for the padlock icon, before buying online. Nearly a fifth (19%) would click on an unsolicited email if it promised them a good deal. More than a third (36%) admit their shopping habits change when faced with an opportunity for a bargain and nearly a quarter (24%) say their fear of missing out on a great deal means they let their guard down when shopping online. Katy Worobec, director of FFA UK, said: Shopping on the internet is easy, convenient and generally very safe, but it can also provide an opportunity for criminals to commit financial fraud from a distance. Fraudsters will use a variety of convincing tactics to entice unsuspecting shoppers to give over their financial details  from unsolicited emails to fake retail websites and bogus ads. Shoppers, wanting to take advantage of these too-good-to-be-true deals, are putting themselves at risk by not taking the time to take five and protect themselves. FFA UKs figures show e-commerce card fraud totalled an estimated 156 million in the first six months of 2016  a 46% increase on the same period last year. In 2015, financial fraud losses reached 755 million, marking a 26% increase in 12 months. Tony Blake, senior fraud prevention officer at the Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit (DCPCU), said: It is easy to forget the dos and donts about sharing personal information if you feel rushed into making a purchase and are under pressure. But it really does pay to take five by doing your research when making an online purchase, particularly if youre using a website for the first time. He said victims may not necessarily see the impact of financial fraud immediately, because if a criminal has harvested their financial details, they could use them at any time. "
