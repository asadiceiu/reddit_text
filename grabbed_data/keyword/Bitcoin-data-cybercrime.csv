Until several months ago, I was a federal prosecutor with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), a position I held for over a decade. Most of my time at DOJ was as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in San Francisco, where I also served as the first Digital Currency Coordinator. Previously I held senior roles at DOJ headquarters in the National Security Division and the Attorney Generals office and was a prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia. I teach a course on financial technologies and cryptocurrency at Stanford University, and recently joined the Board of Directors of Coinbase Global, Inc., where I chair its Audit and Risk Committee. I also advise technology companies and investment funds. During my time as a DOJ prosecutor, I worked cases ranging from national security to violent crimes to corporate and cybercrimes. I prosecuted RICO murders, organized crime, outlaw motorcycle gangs, armed robbery crews, and prison gangs. But I also prosecuted corrupt government officials, identity thieves, bank executives, and international cybercriminals. Although these perpetrators were very different people, they all had one thing in common: Money. Money lay at the heart of every one of the criminal enterprises I just mentioned. And really, most criminal activity is motivated by money. Money laundering, of course, is the process of disguising criminal proceeds and integrating them into the legitimate financial system. It simultaneously conceals criminals ongoing affairs and taints the integrity of the financial system. The World Bank and IMF estimate that every year between $2.17 and $3.61 trillion U.S. dollars are laundered. Criminals are willing to test out new methods of laundering and are early adopters of new technologies. Because of this our AML laws must also evolve, especially given the increased use of the global financial system by money launderers, terrorist financers, drug traffickers, transnational organized criminals, and cybercriminals to place their financial transactions out of reach. This morning I would like to address two sections in the proposed bill that I believe would have the greatest effect in the largest number of cases: (1) the ability of U.S. law enforcement to obtain foreign bank records under Section 15; and (2) Section 18s criminalization of the concealment or provision of false information to a financial institution concerning account and asset ownership. Although time constraints prevent me from addressing all twenty sections, I have encountered issues that other sections of the bill address and of course welcome your questions. 3 SECTION 15 The banking system has become significantly more globalized over the past few decades. And todays criminals make extensive use of this global financial system to channel funds across borders for cybercrime, terrorist financing, drug and human trafficking, public corruption, white collar, tax evasion, and many other crimes. But law enforcements powers have not kept pace with this globalization, and its ability to investigate the transnational movement of money in furtherance of illicit activities is hampered as more and more records reside with foreign banks. Section 15 makes clear U.S. law enforcement can obtain foreign banking records when they are investigating a U.S. crime and where the subject bank has a presence in the U.S. Law enforcements ability to timely gain access to records in such circumstances is critical because following the money is a key piece of evidence in solving nearly any crime and because money can quickly be moved. These bank records contain transactions, of course, but they are much more than that: they show relationships between co-conspirators and they show what legal entities are being used as the vehicles of criminal activity. In theory, under existing law the government can issue grand jury subpoenas to obtain foreign bank records where the bank has (1) a U.S. branch; or (2) a correspondent account with a U.S. bank. See, e.g. 18 U.S.C. Section 5318; In re Grand Jury Proceedings Bank of Nova Scotia, 740 F.2d 817 (11th Cir. 1984). In practice, however, this does not happen. Because such subpoenas may in a handful of cases adversely affect relationships with other countries, current DOJ policy has curbed its own authority and prohibits prosecutors from using so-called Bank of Nova Scotia subpoenas unless DOJs Office of International Affairs (OIA) has approved their use. And OIA rarely, if ever, approves their use, viewing them as a last-resort option where cooperation with a foreign government is not feasible, a conclusion that can take years to reach -- while the records often become obsolete in the meantime. Under DOJ policy, to access such records law enforcement must instead rely on Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs) with foreign countries. The terms of such agreements vary, but generally allow U.S. law enforcement to request assistance from the foreign jurisdiction to obtain evidence. OIA oversees the MLAT request process for the U.S. In practice, the antiquated MLAT process takes months and even years of bureaucratic maneuvering, even in the best-case scenario with cooperative partners on the other side eager to help each other. When we are dealing with an uncooperative country or one that has data protection or secrecy laws, we may not get any evidence at all. In less than two minutes, a money launderer with a smartphone can move illicit proceeds halfway across the world. But for the government, it might take months or even years to obtain evidence of the money flows, if ever. And by then it may be too late. Criminal proceeds are liquidated or moved to new accounts in other jurisdictions, and evidence of associations between individuals and companies become stale. 4 Although these delays get chalked up to working with foreign governments, part of the problem is a self-inflicted wound: it lies in the way DOJ processes MLATs, a process designed long before so much evidence had gone both digital and global. This is illustrated by examples in cases I prosecuted. In one high-profile public corruption investigation, a foreign entity was ready to hand over evidence that included financial records to our investigative team. We needed those records to proceed further in the investigation. The FBI had a local attach and a friendly relationship with local law enforcement, and we had a third-party custodian willing to voluntarily disclose records. But a highly bureaucratic process nonetheless ensued. I drafted a memo and MLAT request to OIA. It was assigned to the OIA representative in Washington responsible for that country for review and some time later I received stylistic comments. After incorporating those, I had to send it back to Washington for several more layers of OIA supervisory review. This led to more comments requiring incorporation. This back and forth alone took weeks if not months. We assumed after this our MLAT was physically with our foreign counterparts who were eager to share records that were material to our investigation. Instead some time later OIA sent us a form to complete concerning which DOJ component was going to pay for the MLAT translation, meaning that it had not even left DOJ. Being a government contract, not just any translator can perform this task and if expedited translation of 30 days or less is desired, one must write an additional justification memo requiring its own layers of bureaucratic approval. The bottom line is that by the time we got our evidence it was approximately six months later, and this was in a case where there was no dispute with the foreign government over the provision of records.2 With a subpoena, records like that could be obtained within weeks instead of months or years. In another case against a major cybercrime ring, many months elapsed from the time we drafted MLATs seeking international bank records to the time the MLATs were actually sent to several receptive jurisdictions. Yet the time it took to get the records back from those jurisdictions was much shorter. Had we not experienced months of needless delay, we may have been able to put the case together sooner, apprehending these individuals before they committed further crimes and depleted some of the subject bank accounts. And in a highprofile money laundering case to a friendly European jurisdiction, a fellow prosecutors MLAT request seeking records sat within DOJ for over a year. Unfortunately, these examples are not outliers. These are actually the good news stories where records were eventually obtained and we were able to bring charges. And these were in cases DOJ considered high profile. Imagine a case involving more routine transnational criminal conduct, where there is no attach to help shepherd the MLAT through, or worse still, the host country is not receptive or has no MLAT treaty. In such cases, records may never be obtained at all. In one well known international organized crime case prosecutors lost the ability to bring certain charges because the MLAT took too long. In other cases, bank accounts 2 Although this statistic is anecdotal, a senior DOJ official told me that there was a backlog of approximately 13,000 MLAT requests at the time this particular MLAT request was pending. 5 were emptied before records requested via MLAT were produced. Prosecutors are conditioned to expect a basic MLAT in a friendly jurisdiction to take many months, and years in a nonfriendly jurisdiction, a fact that deters some from investigating cases that will require them in the first place. What causes the delays? First, there were too many layers of bureaucratic review in every case.3 Second, those responsible for making decisions about the collection of overseas evidence are not part of the team responsible for the case, yet they are making decisions essential to the case. Add to this that OIA is responsible not only for outgoing MLATs from U.S. law enforcement, but also for incoming MLATs from foreign law enforcement.4 Third, there is no tracking system to show where or with whom the MLAT resides at any given point. DOJ has acknowledged it lacks any means of monitoring MLATs, including transparency for monitoring the progress of each request at each iterative step, and there is no system for MLAT partners to monitor the status of requests. See DOJ, Criminal Division FY 2016, Presidents Budget at 22- 25. Although addressing these factors would certainly not mean evidence would be obtained from foreign authorities overnight, it would go a long way toward expediting the process and in fast-moving investigations every day can count. I need to stress here that the problem is with the OIA process and not the personnel. And the problem is not confined to cybercrime investigations; it impacts cases involving trafficking in narcotics, weapons, and people; fraud; terrorist finance; public corruption; and really any crime that involves the movement of money. It arose in the investigation into the Russian election probe: it was widely reported that Muellers team subpoenaed foreign bank records in the case against Paul Manafort. If Muellers team had gone through the process described above instead of subpoenaed the banks directly, would the evidence have been timely obtained? By not using Bank of Nova Scotia to full effect and requiring its own internal bureaucracy, U.S. law enforcement is tying one hand behind its back in the fight against global money laundering. Reaffirming law enforcements authority to obtain records directly from a foreign banks U.S. branch or correspondent bank could bring about a much-needed change in investigations, because it would allow U.S. law enforcement to more quickly and effectively track movement of funds without going through the cumbersome process described above. The question arises 3 It may be that some complicated requests merit more review, particularly where the vagaries of foreign law require it, but the routine requests appear to needlessly go through much the same bureaucratic and time-consuming review process. 4 Many foreign law enforcement partners prioritize U.S. MLAT requests given that our foreign counterparts rely heavily on evidence stored in the U.S. for their own cases (from Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, etc.) and hope that prioritizing U.S. requests will expedite their own requests. However, the flip side of this is when our own bureaucracy delays the processing of incoming MLAT requests from other countries, those jurisdictions may penalize the U.S. by holding back evidence our MLATs seek. 6 as to where a foreign bank operates in jurisdictions with strict data privacy or bank secrecy laws. Such scenarios pose complex conflict of laws questions. But federal courts have reasoned where commercial transactions are international, conflicts are inevitable and U.S. criminal investigations cannot be thwarted whenever there is a potential conflict. See, e.g. Nova Scotia, supra. Other courts have reasoned that banks electing to do business in numerous foreign host countries have accepted the risk of inconsistent government actions, and that if a bank cannot serve two masters and comply with the lawful requirements of [both countries], perhaps it should surrender to one sovereign or the other the privileges received therefrom. See, e.g., First National City Bank of New York v. IRS, 271 F.2d 616, 620 (2d Cir. 1959). Passing Section 15 provides DOJ an opportunity to revisit its existing policy, and makes clear to the Executive and Judicial branches that Congress has considered the potential for conflicts and has resolved that in favor of law enforcements ability to timely gather critical evidence. DOJ could extend its existing policy such that OIA approval would still be required for foreign bank subpoenas, thereby rendering Section 15 toothless.5 To account for that possibility, the Committee may wish to include language requiring an annual report from DOJ concerning (1) the number of requests from law enforcement for foreign bank subpoenas; (2) the number granted; (3) the timeframe in which requests were resolved from the date first received; and (4) whether any categories exist for which OIA could grant ex ante blanket approval for foreign bank subpoenas, e.g., if law enforcement certified they believed absent the records funds were in danger of moving before an MLAT could be completed, whether certain banks or countries could be whitelisted, etc. And regardless of Section 15 and its implementation, the MLAT process must be modernized and streamlined if law enforcement is to keep up with the those committing illegal acts. The Committee may therefore wish to request DOJ report on ways to modernize the MLAT process. Such a report may include the feasibility of an MLAT tracking system, in the same way that several other criminal matters are tracked within DOJ and in the same way that the Treasury Department tracks similar requests for international assistance; measuring what priority is being given to outgoing MLATs versus incoming MLATs; and providing statistics on the number of MLAT requests received, the time until fulfillment, etc. A word on authentication. The provision requires foreign banks to produce certified records in response to the subpoena. At the investigative stage, financial records in any form are critical. Certified copies may become important if a case goes to trial, but given that over 90% of federal cases settle and most defendants waive Speedy Trial Act requirements, I view this provision as helpful though far less important than getting the records in some form in the first place. 5 Unfortunately the process for requesting OIA approval to subpoena foreign banks is similar to the MLAT process, and is subject to its own set of delays. Many prosecutors believe that requesting approval for a foreign bank subpoena is as long and cumbersome as a formal MLAT request. 7 SECTION 18 Although to many, global money laundering conjures up images of offshore Cayman Islands accounts or secret Swiss bank vaults, the fact is that the U.S. is one of the easiest places in the world to launder money. According to our Treasury Department, a staggering $300 billion is laundered in the U.S. every year. Our laws regarding shell and shelf companies and beneficial ownership of accounts are one reason why. Although there is nothing illegal about setting up shell companies  many do so to appropriately protect privacy and limit liability  plenty of others do so to conceal criminal activity and hide money. Fraudsters, cartels, terrorists, and corrupt officials do not want to keep stolen assets in their own names. They therefore create a company, or series of companies (including nested shell companies, or shells within shells), which can do all of the things they otherwise could have with their criminally-gotten proceeds: buy property, open bank accounts, and transfer money. In the U.S. and elsewhere it is easy and legal to create what are essentially anonymous companies. Lawyers, accountants, and other professionals derive substantial income from providing these services. And while shells are easy to set up, they make it difficult for investigators to link money with perpetrators. The 2016 Panama Papers brought mainstream attention to the problem of concealing true beneficial owners of accounts. That leak revealed that a Panamanian law firm set up or managed offshore companies and hard-to-trace corporate structures for world leaders, drug kingpins, American fraudsters, and others. And 60 Minutes shed light on the role that U.S. lawyers play in helping criminals devise structures to launder money: An undercover investigator purporting to be an advisor to a West African minister met with lawyers from over a dozen New York law firms. He told them a story intentionally devised to raise red flags and lead them to believe he wanted to move tens of millions of dollars in payments from foreign companies (obtained using his official position in exchange for mineral rights) into U.S. real estate, a jet, and a yacht. Only 1 of 16 said no; most offered guidance on how it could be accomplished legally. Parking money in accounts whose ownership is concealed has collateral consequences. It has been cited as fueling increased housing prices in cities like London, Miami, New York, Paris, Vancouver, and San Francisco, as western real estate holdings are a desired investment for dirty money. In fact, it was reported that in 2015 90% of new construction sales in Miami were in cash, a red flag for money laundering. 6 And according to the U.K.s National Crime Agency, laundered money has skewed the London property market with overseas criminals 6 See Miami Herald, How Secret Offshore Money Helps Fuel Miamis Luxury Real-Estate Boom, April 3, 2016 at URL 8 sequestering funds there and driving real estate prices up 50% in less than a decade. 7 To help combat the problem, the Treasury Departments Financial Crimes Enforcement Network last year announced the Customer Due Diligence beneficial ownership rule (CDD) which requires financial institutions to gather details about the individual(s) who actually owns or controls, directly or indirectly, an account held in the name of a legal entity like an LLC. The CDD will come into effect next May and is an important first step in the fight against international money laundering. But nothing in the CDD rule prevents individuals from simply lying about ownership to financial institutions, and financial institutions can rely upon customer representations. Section 18 would give the CDD teeth by making it a crime to provide false information to financial institutions concerning ownership or control of an account. Many laypeople assume that is already a crime, but that is not always the case. For example, in 2012 we were investigating a group committing large scale mortgage fraud in California, a scheme that caused tens of millions of dollars in losses. The ringleader had bank accounts established in an acquaintances name and paid the acquaintance, but the two agreed it was the defendant who would actually own the accounts. The defendant used this nominee account to facilitate his scheme, depositing mortgage fraud proceeds into it. We wanted to charge the defendant (or acquaintance) with lying to the bank about the accounts true owner but realized this on its own was not a crime.8 Prosecutors frequently see shell companies and corresponding financial accounts created to park foreign funds from overseas criminal activity, including from Russia and China. A group of Russian cybercriminals I prosecuted made extensive use of nominee accounts in the U.S. and Europe, yet we lacked charges to prosecute those who established the accounts. And a pair of corrupt federal agents on the Silk Road task force I prosecuted made use of shell companies and nominee accounts to conceal proceeds from their illegal activity. One of my former colleagues had a defendant whose sole occupation was to create shell companies, provide false identification documents as account holders, and move tens of millions of dollars across borders in furtherance of criminal activity. Confronted with facts like these some prosecutors have gotten creative and charged such conduct as a violation of the bank fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. Section 1344. However, an element of that offense is that a defendant intended to defraud a financial institution  in other words the financial institution was the victim. But in many cases where someone falsifies information concerning financial account ownership for criminal activity, the financial institution is not the intended victim of the fraud; it may not lose any money and in some instances, may even benefit from the additional business. 7 See Financial Times, How Laundered Money Shapes Londons Property Market, April 6, 2016 at URL 8 Because many of the mortgage lenders had gone out of business in the mortgage crisis, the records to charge mortgage fraud were not available to us for all transactions. 9 Thus, federal courts have split on whether it is permissible to charge a case of bank fraud where the financial institution was not the intended victim. Some courts of appeals have held that the financial institution itself must be the targeted victim for a bank fraud violation. See, e.g. United States v. Thomas, 315 F.3d 190, 197 (3rd Cir. 2002) (the sine qua non of a bank fraud violationis the intent to defraud the bank.) (emphasis added); United States v. Blackmon, 839 F.2d 900, 905-06 (2nd Cir. 1998); United States v. Rodriguez, 140 F.3d 163, 167 (2nd Cir. 1988) (schemes merely involving bank not crimes unless specific intent to victimize bank itself causing it to release property). Other courts have read the bank fraud statute more broadly, holding that deceiving a bank alone is sufficient and no intent to victimize the bank is required. See, e.g., United States v. McNeil, 320 F.3d 1034, 1037 (9th Cir. 2003) (requiring only that bank is in some way involved in the defendants scheme); United States v. Kenrick, 221 F.3d 19, 26-29 (1st Cir. 2000). This split of authority means that whether such conduct is a crime under the bank fraud statute depends on what area of the country one is in. I am aware of investigations where prosecutors struggle to find a statute to charge instances involving concealed beneficial ownership. They may be able to deploy other statutes to fit the conduct, they may not. But there is currently no clean, straightforward statute to charge this conduct. Section 18 would provide that. Criminal penalties could deter individuals, and importantly their agents, from lying about the ultimate owners of accounts. At the same time, it would ease the burden on financial institutions by putting part of the know your customer onus on the customer, who could be liable if they concealed, falsified, or misrepresented. Given how useful it is for criminals to have financial accounts that are seemingly unconnected to them, I view this feature of the legislation as an important next step in the fight against global money laundering. Thank you for inviting me to share my thoughts on these important issues. TLDR; Want to fight money laundering and criminal activities? The national banking institution is one of the largest causes of criminal activities. "

Bitcoin and other forms of virtual money -- known as cryptocurrencies -- appeal to North Korea as the U.S. pursues international sanctions aimed at further isolating the country, according to a new report from FireEye. ""Sanctions against North Korea are likely to fuel their cybercrime activity,"" said Bryce Boland, Singapore-based chief technology officer with FireEye. ""Attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges can be a great vehicle to obtain what is ultimately hard currency."" It's just the latest example of the illicit ways North Korea allegedly brings in money as it endures wave after wave of increasingly tough international sanctions over its rapidly advancing nuclear weapons program. FireEye says it has identified three attacks against South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges that took place between May and July, all of them linked to North Korean hackers. The spike in activity began soon after the U.S. said it planned to ratchet up sanctions against North Korea. With fresh U.N. sanctions and bitcoin's skyrocketing value, ""the potential windfall from these attacks has risen accordingly,"" Boland said. A single bitcoin is currently worth more than $4,300, up from less then $1,000 at the start of the year. FireEye identified the North Korean group behind the bitcoin attacks as TEMP.Hermit. Other security firms have linked the group to past high-profile cyberattacks, including the hacking of Sony Pictures in 2014. Hackers tied to North Korea are also suspected of carrying out a series of attacks on global banks that came to light last year. They included a cyberheist on Bangladesh's central bank in which tens of millions of dollars were stolen. The North Korean government has repeatedly denied involvement in international cyberattacks. Intelligence agencies and cybersecurity experts have also linked North Korea to WannaCry, the biggest cyberattack the world has ever seen. The WannaCry virus initially demanded victims pay a ransom in bitcoin, yielding more than $140,000. Related: Someone has emptied the ransom accounts from the WannaCry attack Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies areoften held in accounts at online exchanges. But FireEye points out that hackers can swap them into other, more anonymous cryptocurrencies -- or move them elsewhere and eventually withdraw them in traditional currencies like South Korean won or U.S. dollars. North Korean hackers have previously targeted South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges, stealing bitcoin worth $88,000 (at the time) between 2013 and 2015, according to Yonhap News, which cited South Korean cybersecurity firm Hauri.

14,cybercrime,Bitcoin,Details on various issues with BTC-e and why I have always considered them not to be solvent.,5,6pzu2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6pzu2b/details_on_various_issues_with_btce_and_why_i/,2017-07-28 09:13:48,"The recent news of btc-e is unsurprising to those with a knowledge of how they have been doing business since their inception. I figured I would document some events that have taken place for historical purposes so people can be aware of what was writing on the wall. **BTC-e was hacked in 2014** People don't seem to be aware of the fact that btc-e was hacked in 2014 and the database is floating around in certain places. I personally possess the database and can confirm that it is legitimate. The only version that I have seen floating around includes two files, one that includes 198k Usernames, emails, and hashed passwords (hashed with a weird form of bcrypt). There is also a file with USD, BTC, and LTC balances of 568k users. The first file with emails+hashes is seemingly incomplete because there are many emails in the balance file not in the email+hash file. Interestingly enough, there is a file of cracked hashes floating around that has 168k lines, many of which do not show up in the first file but do show up in the balance file, so there must be a full version of the email+hash list floating around. As far as I know btc-e has never confirmed this hack but did force password resets in **September 2016**, after the data went public from 2014. This means they went two years while hundreds of thousands of accounts were vulnerable and btc-e did not alert their users. **Btc-e was exploited using an xss exploit in April 2013** Back in 2013 i remember getting a private message from someone linking to a picture of a bitcoin chart. The page silently exploited an xss exploit that withdrew all their funds (if they had no email confirmed on the account. Btc-e mandated email confirmation for withdrawals after this incident). I actually copied the exploit code and just found it if anyones interested at looking at it. URL It seems they got away with 61 bitcoin. Haven't seen anyone mention this so i thought it was interesting. **BTC suspended many accounts and demanded full kyc verification to unlock** This is particularly interesting because btc-e is *the* exchange to go to to launder funds. This has always been the case even prior to the recent news. So why the fuck would they start requiring identity verification? It was simply to close accounts and take their funds. Their US support is laughable to say the least and I believe at one point there was no english support working at all. **BTC-e *might* have links to cybercrime** I apologize for not having enough information on this because i lost my full notes, but i remember doing some research into the btc-e.com domain whois history and somehow connecting this email according to one of the notes i found. golinvest@gmail.com. when you google this you can see that it is connected to malware domains. I really can't remember what connected this to btc-e so feel free to ignore this but i figured i'd give some fellow researches a possible lead. Overall, I would be surprised if btc-e is solvent. They have obvious connections to bad things and most likely the russian mafia, so fair dealing is not really a requirement when no one knows who you are. They simply need to keep enough funds to fulfill withdrawals for a while and they can keep collecting trading fees, which amount to millions every month. I have a feeling we might not see btc-e come back from it's recent down time so it might be a good idea to write those funds off on your losses. Just thought i'd share some interesting history, i love this stuff. Feel free to add your own contributions to this list."
15,cybercrime,Bitcoin,Explaining why big blocks are 'bad',70,6lmpll,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6lmpll/explaining_why_big_blocks_are_bad/,2017-07-07 02:01:48,"I got in a discussion on Facebook yesterday with a number of my friends who are 'big blockers'. They are still my Facebook friends, legitimately. These are guys I have known for a long time and they hold classic big-blocker views. They aren't professional paid trolls. They just genuinely believe that big-blocks are harmless and see no problems with scaling on-chain. I made my arguments to them and they were unwilling to accept any premise that I proposed. I think it's a fair point that we should be able to better express our reasons for avoiding big-blocks on the main bitcoin blockchain. Especially since part of the solution going forward might involve a big-block sidechain. If we think creating a big-block sidechain would be such a great idea, I think it's a fair point to ask if big-blocks are fine for a sidechain, why aren't they for the main network? Yesterday, in my argument, my number one reason for avoiding big-blocks on the main network was that it would lead to governments regulating node operators. The friends I spoke to literally had zero concerns about this. Here are some of their comments: * *""What government? These are global networks.""* * *""Good luck stopping massive nodes in China, Korea, Japan, Russia, Switzerland, Iceland, Amsterdam, Netherlands, and even Mars.""* * *""Why would all nodes be housed by businesses? And no, all businesses are NOT located in the US. Don't kid yourself. There is no global governmental control over businesses.""* * *""Well, Bitcoin running on Raspberry Pis shouldn't worry then. just let DASH take the arrows of regulation WHEN it scales next year. if DASH succeeds, then maybe Bitcoin Core will finally admit the folly of their ways!""* * *""Do you keep forgetting we are talking about a whole planet? If they could regulate bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency they would have already. They can't. They don't have global control. And individually, nations risk overplaying their hand and exposing their tyrany and giving far more reason for the existence of a free market of currencies.""* * *""$20K nodes is peanuts for thousands of Bitcoin millionaires who want Bitcoin to stay true to the original whitepaper! heck i will donate my $20K of Bitcoin if it means scaling beyond VISA! and i'm not even a Bitcoin millionaire!""* * *""Again, did you forget you are talking about an entire planet? What global gestapo is going to be employed to scour the planet for nodes?""* * *""They would regulate the nodes *right now* if they had that kind of power.""* * *""But if and when that happens, the governments will be faced with stopping IOTA, EOS, and Ethereum running on PoS.""* * *""In theory, Bitcoin, or something similar, can be recreated and implemented on top of Ethereum/Ethereum Classic and next generation blockchains like EOS. so good luck stopping cryptocurrencies!""* * *"" You mean banksters run the old payment networks. I fail to see the significance of this fact. They are now obsolete and they cannot control this cryptocurrency revolution""* So, while I am encouraged by my friend's optimism, frankly this all sounds incredibly naive to me. I am of the opinion, possibly wrong, that the only thing protecting bitcoin from more significant government intervention is that fact that the network is extremely lightweight and mobile. The fact that nodes consume relatively little bandwidth and can run on very low end machines makes the network much more resilient in the face of attack. In my view, it is largely for this reason the bitcoin network has survived to date. I am of the opinion that if all bitcoin nodes ran on $20k machines sucking down massive, massive, amounts of bandwidth, these would be easy and soft targets for government regulators. Even if governments of the world are ok with letting 'bitcoin the currency' survive, I do not think they will let it continue without AML/KYC and blacklists. I believe that as soon as there are clearly identifiable business entities running nodes they will regulate the shit out of them, on threat of fines and jail. ISPs would shut down any normal joe-blow user from running nodes. The traffic would be easily identifiable. In fact, governments can simply pass laws regulating ISPs from allowing bitcoin traffic. Maybe I'm a bit paranoid here, but I live in a nation that has jailed millions for a harmless plant. Every single attempt at creating an unregulated payment system in the past has ended up with either massive regulation (@see PayPal) or thrown people in jail (@see Liberty Reserve). This notion that governments cannot and will not act in concert and co-operation to stop the supposed scourge of 'money laundering, terrorism funding, tax evasion, child pornography, human trafficking, and cybercrime' is completely naive. I am of the opinion that we should keep the bitcoin network as small as possible; moving risky and experimental development to secondary layers which, if they go down, do not affect the core network or currency in any way. Am I being too pessimistic here? Am I being too paranoid? Is the threat of government control blown out of proportion? Does ETH, Dash, hundreds of cyrptos, and ICOs all prove 'we have already won'? and they can't do shit to us? When two parties cannot even agree on what is at risk, I think this is the key disconnect on this debate."

22,cybercrime,Bitcoin,Barbados contributes to the Commonwealths legislative framework on digital currencies,32,3infb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3infb8/barbados_contributes_to_the_commonwealths/,2015-08-28 07:44:53,"BRIDGETOWN; August 24, 2015: When the Commonwealth Secretariat and its 53 member states meet this week to craft the legislative framework of digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Barbados will be represented by Gabriel Abed, CEO and Co-Founder of Bitt, the regions premier asset exchange company. I have been selected as one of the experts in the field to adequately address regulation and security concerns of math-based currencies and help governments understand the importance of decentralised solutions, explained Abed. Abed is well placed to add his voice, given his companys focus on security and providing access to emerging and developing markets by utilising block chain technologies such as Bitcoin. The August 24-26, 2015 meeting of the Virtual Currencies Working Group (VCWG) is touted to be the first ever discussion at such a high level with an extensive global approach. I proudly represent Bitt.com, Barbados and the entire Bitcoin community when facing down the barrel of government bodies on the stance they should take. My stance is to not regulate block-chain technologies and do not hinder innovation, Abed added. The Commonwealths Roundtable initial determinations regarding the benefits of virtual currencies concluded that despite the clear dangers of virtual currencies, significant benefits could accrue from them to citizens of member states, particularly in providing low-cost remittance and foreign exchange services, access to new financial products and as a driver of innovation in the online economy in the form of phenomena such as micro-tipping. There are clear linkages to economic development. As such it is necessary to also consider that virtual currencies may be able to play a valuable role in the monetary and economic systems of some member states, it has stated. At their 2013 meeting, Commonwealth Heads of Government expressed their unwavering commitment to fight money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Specifically the Heads noted the need for concerted efforts aimed at ensuring safe, secure, cost-effective and accessible channels for legitimate money transfer operations worldwide so as to ensure that this critical lifeline to developing countries is not compromised. A major obstacle to achieving this aim is the increasing threat of cybercrime. Recognising this, the Heads of Government mandated the Commonwealth Secretariat (the Secretariat) to encourage collaboration by member states with relevant international organisations and agencies, to develop appropriate programmes of technical assistance, in order to enhance capacity in resource-constrained settings. In pursuance of these mandates, the Secretariat convened a Roundtable on Virtual Currencies with the aims of:  Raising awareness of emerging trends in the use of virtual currencies among Commonwealth member states and to sensitising states on the need to follow such developments;  Determining any risks that these trends pose, with a focus on the potential of virtual currencies to be associated with criminal offences, including the financing of terrorism. To enable Commonwealth member states to acquire an overview of existing responses and possible new responses to address any harmful impact, and to set milestones for future action. The result of the Roundtable was the establishment of the Working Group (which Abed is a member of) for the purpose of delivering both the Report and the Technical Guidance. In working to deliver these outcomes the following issues will be explored by the Working Group: 1. To gain an understanding of the use of virtual currencies within the Commonwealth; 2. To determine any risks that these uses pose, with a focus on the potential of virtual currencies to be associated with criminal offences, including the financing of terrorism; 3. To enable Commonwealth member states to acquire an overview of existing responses and possible new responses to address any harmful impact; 4. To determine the opportunities that the use of virtual currencies presents for the Commonwealth; 5. To determine the possible indicators of the use of virtual currencies in a given jurisdiction; and 6. To reach a consensus on a policy approach which can be recommended to the rest of the Commonwealth. In the long term, the aim is: 1. To consider the reach, strengths and weaknesses of existing national regulatory and criminal law frameworks, if any, in response to the development of virtual currencies; 2. To determine appropriate policy thrust required by Commonwealth member states in addressing the phenomenon of virtual currencies. 3. To plan a way forward for the development of these resources and solutions including the allocation of responsibility for delivering aspects of this work. To help meet these objectives, the Secretariat has prepared a skeleton report for the Groups consideration. "
