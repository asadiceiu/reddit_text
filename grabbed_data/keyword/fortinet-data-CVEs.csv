0,CVEs,fortinet,800D dropping packets over ssl VPN connected Clients in 6.0.7,1,e6l7gm,https://www.reddit.com/r/fortinet/comments/e6l7gm/800d_dropping_packets_over_ssl_vpn_connected/,2019-12-06 05:22:28,"Hello everyone, We recently updated our 800D firewalls to 6.0.7 code due to CVEs on 6.0.6. Since then we have been experiencing dropouts of RDP sessions and it turns out any persistent network connection. Doing traces it appears that the firewall is dropping packets from the RDP server in response to the requests coming from the client. It turns out that there is a known bug in 6.0.7 that causes the firewall to identify two IDs for the client in some cases which causes issues with session tracking and therefore the firewall forgets where to to send the traffic. I am sure I am oversimplifying that but support confirmed its a known bug in 6.0.7 which will only be fixed in the 6.2 and 6.4 tracks :( Bug ID 582265 Anyone know how to get more info on this bug ID?"
