The Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Bill received approval from the English crown recently. This project is an updated version of a previously existing law that gives new powers to the authorities to combat terrorist activities. The bill unleashed controversy over the inclusion of a section that classifies as a crime access to potentially useful information for a person or group to commit or plan a terrorist act, which now extends to the visualization or transmission of online content. This new British law has already been criticized by human rights groups and even some remarkable voices on the issue of combating terrorism, report specialists in [**network security**](URL In the original proposal it was established that the crime consisted in accessing this kind of material three or more times, although this was dismissed from the final project, so now it will suffice for a person to access this material once to incur the crime. The bill has also increased the maximum penalty for punishing the planning of terrorist activities (including collection of material), securing in 15 years imprisonment. According to network security specialists, practically anyone who interacts with this online material could be pursued by the British authorities, mention security specialists. Of course, this decision raised concern because of the potential abuse that authorities can make of these faculties. Independent reviewers to the British government believe that the only thing that this law could generate are mass arrests, and they also believe that the work of researchers, academics and journalists will be affected by this legislation. On the other hand, groups of specialists consider that the new law does not help to establish a boundary between the act of planning a crime and the fact of carrying it out. Differentiating the intention of doing something and the materialization of the Act is fundamental to the application of the law; this project does not contribute to differentiate these notions. The British government has mentioned that the law contemplates reasonable doubt in cases where the implicated ignores or has no reason to believe that the material accessed on the Internet is regarded as terrorist propaganda."

The site was shut down in April 2018, although the authorities still continue to search for suspects. UK **National Crime Agency** (NCA) mentions that it is planning additional actions against nearly 400 suspected Webstresser customers in British territory. [**Network security**](URL experts in Europol say that Webstresser has collaborated to launch more than 4 million of **denial of service** (DDoS) attacks and, at the time of its closure, had more than 150k registered clients. Rates for its users ranged from $15 to $20 per month. NCA said it had already issued legal warnings (known as cease and desist notices) to many of the users whose devices were seized during these raids. These notices announce to those involved future legal actions if they continue their outside the law activities. This is a sign that although users of these services believe they can remain hidden, a fake user name and the use of cryptocurrency transactions will not provide them with the desired anonymity, said Jim Stokley, network security specialist and director of the NCA Cyber Crime Unit. We have already identified multiple suspects linked to Webstresser, and they will be brought before the courts, reaffirms Stokley. These actions in search of Webstresser clients are part of an international initiative against the use of the sites to hire services of DDoS attacks. During this operation, 15 other websites offering similar services to Webstresser were shut down. Romanian authorities also seized two suspicious sites and expected to share the information collected in these operations with Europol. Cybersecurity expert Brian Krebs said that some firms of information security professionals have criticized this joint effort against customers of services such as those offered by Webstresser: Most of them are young people under the age of 21 who use these services in disputes related to online video games, the expert mentioned.

According to experts, this law will allow Australian authorities to force companies such as Google, Facebook, etc., to provide access to encrypted communications from their users in cases where it is deemed necessary. According to the Australian government, approving this law implies providing law enforcement agencies with a fundamental tool for combating and preventing high-impact crime, such as terrorist attacks, narcotics trafficking, arms smuggling, or children sexual exploitation. This bill was supported by the main Representatives political forces in Australia, so it was sent to the upper house. Thus, the Anti encryption law could enter into force at the beginning of 2019. Although details of the actual scope of this law are still unknown, it is clear that it contains guidelines necessary for technology companies to provide assistance to the Australian Government at three different levels: * **Request for technical assistance**: technology companies are requested to provide voluntary assistance to law enforcement agencies. In other words, companies must eliminate electronic protection, provide technical information, install software, place information in a particular format, and facilitate access to devices or services * **Technical assistance notice**: instead of asking the company for assistance, this level of action implies that the company is flexible with the authorities in cases where they have the means to intervene a communication (when there is no encryption, for example) * **Notice of technical capabilities**: This notice, issued by the attorney General, will require companies to develop new capabilities to decrypt communications required by the Australian police In other words, these guidelines would force technology companies to modify their software and infrastructure to access encrypted communications via backdoor, reaching information that would be impossible to access in other ways. It should be noted that companies that do not adhere to this new regulatory framework could face severe economic sanctions. According to specialists in digital forensics, the document states that no company will be forced to implement a systemic weakness in its software or hardware, nor can they be forced to eliminate electronic protections, such as encryption. On the other hand, the legislation establishes measures aimed at facilitating legal access to information through two different ways: * Decrypting encrypted technologies * Access to communications and data in points where there is no encryption We encourage the Government to maintain its intention not to weaken encryption or to force suppliers to build weaknesses in their products the Bill stipulates. In this way, the Australian authorities intend to break into the encrypted communications of the users of these services without forcing the companies to disrupt the encryption of their developments, as well as exploiting the possibility of accessing unencrypted communications. It is obvious that to achieve these objectives companies like Apple, Samsung, Google or WhatsApp must collaborate with the Government, although the position of all major providers of this kind of services is not yet known. Australia integrates the [**Five Eyes**](URL alliance with the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand, so that specialists in digital forensics and cybersecurity consider that, if approved in Australia, the Anti encryption law could find counterparts in the rest of the member countries of this alliance."

According to specialists in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, this operation was launched last November, with agencies across Europe chasing multiple members of gangs dedicated to money laundering and other crimes throughout dark web. Europol stated through a press release that 235 people were arrested during this operation, mostly for crimes related to money counterfeiting. In addition, the agency reported that 300 houses were raided. A key factor for the success of this operation was the carelessness of one of the suspects, as their limited security measures allowed a data leaking that the agencies used to track an illegal transaction. Thanks to unencrypted information, it was easier for agencies to identify gang members involved in money counterfeit. According to experts in digital forensics, the operators of this scam received payments in cryptocurrency, but they managed a record of their clients email addresses. In addition to the arrests performed, the authorities seized almost two thousand euro banknotes of various denominations, as well as multiple weapons, drugs, hardware for cryptojacking, computers, smartphones and virtual assets (Bitcoin). On the other hand, the French police discovered two facilities dedicated to the cultivation of marijuana and an illegal print shop. 2018 has been a prominent year in the fight against dark web crimes. Last June, the Austrian authorities shut down a dark web portal and succeeded in arresting its operators in an operation run by the Austrian Federal Police Office and Europol. During this operation, a counterfeit euro printing press was also shut in Leoben, Austria.

This cyberattack campaign mentioned by the cybersecurity experts might be related in some way to the malicious campaigns sponsored by the Chinese government, according to the member countries of the [**Five Eyes**](URL group (United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand). Recently, U.S. secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security officer Kirstjen Nielsen made a serious calling to the Chinese government to act responsibly after the detection of a broad campaign of cyberattacks against intellectual property and sensitive trade data on American territory, in addition to Europe and several parts of Asia. A few weeks ago, U.S. prosecutors formally charged two Chinese citizens, allegedly linked to an Asian espionage agency, pointing them as guilty of crimes such as espionage, theft of confidential data from the U.S. government and different companies around the world. In American territory, Chinese spies would have attacked NASA, the Navy, and the Department of Energy, as the experts in cybersecurity reported.

While most of the attention is focused on the drug or weapons sale, there are many other illegal activities to consider. Wildlife trafficking, for example, is growing exponentially, becoming a very lucrative business in certain parts of the world, especially in India, a country where [darknet](URL seems to play a more important role than ever. Several reports have recently been published about the decline of certain animal species, especially exotic animals; tigers, elephants and zebras have seen their populations decrease at an alarming rate. There seems to be no way to reverse this trend, mainly because sales in darknet continue to increase. India seems to play an important role in this illegal industry. According to reports of experts in [digital forensics](URL from the International Institute of Cyber Security, wildlife trafficking in this country via darknet has reached new heights, with many illicit businesses taking place at every hour of the day. The anonymity provided by these services, as well as the scarce capacity to intervene of the authorities, makes it very easy to carry out these transactions. Although the government in India claims to fight this crime on a regular basis, these supposed efforts are not yet reflected in practice. The Indian Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) is in the process of creating a unit designed to address this activity at darknet. When will be ready this new unit is not clear at this time, but it seems to be a first step in the right direction. Regarding this panorama, WCCB officials mention: There is evidence that criminals use darknet on a wide scale to smuggle illegal specimens of the wildlife of endangered species, as well as their derivatives, such as elephant ivory, rhino horns and stuff. The use of encrypted messaging applications, such as Telegram, Signal and WhatsApp, makes it difficult for our cybersecurity and digital forensics teams to link this activity with malicious actors in the real world. At the moment, the only course of action is to intensify the monitoring efforts of this activity. This new unit will help monitor this animal traffic, although it will be very difficult to take immediate action against traffickers. A notable trend is how hunters have created their own slang derived from the Indian language to offer these goods in darknet. This language is constantly evolving, making it even more difficult to get an overview of the current species trafficking context.

The ruling, dictated in recent days in a Florida district court, is part of a five-year legal battle of Gregory Faulls representatives against John McAfee, who spent some time living in Belize before his neighbors demise. At the time, the local newspaper San Pedro Sun reported the death of Faull. The man, a 52-year-old American retiree was found by his housekeeper in the living room of his house with a gunshot wound to the back of his head at the end of 2012, the local media reported. Although the local police wanted to interrogate McAfee as a potential witness to the incident, the millionaire, who is the founder of the [McAfee](URL antivirus software firm, was outside his home in Belize. Despite the fact that the investigation of the crime was being stopped, the relatives of Faull presented a civil case against McAfee, according to the information that is known in the industry of computer security and digital forensics. The court will issue a judgment for non-compliance with respect to the plaintiffs liability and against the defendant for the wrongful death of Gregory V. Faull, ruled the US District judge, Gregory Presnell, who had previously closed the case Against McAfee until a ruling by the US Court of Appeals was issued, forcing the reopening of the legal process. John McAfee, however, does not seem to have been involved in the legal process, judging by the surprising lack of legal records presented by him in the case, to the point that he had not even hired a lawyer. The Faull defense allegation was therefore successfully applied to the default trial against McAfee. A January 2019 bank test was scheduled to determine what damages the antivirus company owner will have to pay. According to reports of experts in [digital forensics](URL on one occasion local police raided the property of McAfee for claims on an alleged drug production and storage campaign, as well as being accused of carrying unlicensed firearms. After the raid, the Belize authorities withdrew all charges against the employer. However, the biggest controversy during McAfees stay in Belize has been the death of its neighbor, Gregory Faull. Faull, who was last seen alive on a Saturday in November 2012, filed a formal complaint against McAfee for the latters bad behavior, complaining about his habit of shooting weapons and the misconduct of his dogs. When the police searched the home of McAfee, wanting to interrogate the software developer company owner at once for the disappearance of their neighbor, he was not there. A few weeks later, McAfee reappeared in Guatemala, after illegally entering that country, as he himself admitted, to try to obtain political asylum. The McAfee application did not bear fruit and eventually returned to the United States."

The comments of the Department of Justice official were followed by recent criticisms of the US justice system for their actions, as reported by specialists in [digital forensics](URL from the International Institute of Cyber Security. So far, members of government-supported hacking groups have been considered out-of-bounds in terms of criminal prosecution, and have been given the same protections as intelligence officers and military combatants. Many legal experts argued that these hackers had committed no crime because they simply acted on orders received from superiors running intelligence operations. However, in the most recent years, the United States have decided to break with this unwritten rule among nations with advanced cybersecurity capabilities. The first indictment occurred in 2014, when the United States accused five Chinese hackers, members of Unit 61398 of the third Department of the Peoples Liberation Army of China (PLA) for attacks on a number of US government agencies and private companies. The United States then accused three other hackers in the Asian country in 2017, alleging that they attacked US companies on behalf of the Chinese state under the guise of Boyusec, a Chinese digital forensics company. More recently, in March 2018, the United States accused nine Iranian hackers employed by the Mabna Institute. The DOJ held that the nine hackers carried out their activities on behalf of the body of Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard. The following indictment came in July 2018, when the US accused 12 Russian hackers of the attacks on the Democratic Party. The policies of the DOJ have attracted criticism from many sectors, now the institution has decided to respond. There are some who question the US governments approach to dealing with hackers sponsored by other governments, often because many arrests have not been made, said Adam Hickey, Deputy General Attorney of the DOJ National Security Division. It is easy to forget that, until recently, such charges had not been heard, because for a long time this was considered only a problem of intelligence, without considering the disruption and deterrence, which are our objectives in dealing with terrorism, espionage and other threats of national security. But imagine a world in which there are no criminal charges, no formal accusations against these activities. It would be the work of the private sector only to accuse the culprits; what message does this send to foreign hackers? The official argues that these accused hackers have taken intelligence activities to a criminal field. According to specialists in digital forensics, the purpose of the US is for other countries to take similar measures against the criminal computer activities that governments have disguised as intelligence activities."

Digital forensics experts have commented on the drawbacks to these smart devices, including some security and privacy implications. Digital license plates can be just a part of the problem, as digital transit signs may also be used for surveillance. **Spying road signs** Have you ever been through one of those digital traffic signals that measure the speed at which youre going? Because they are not there simply to avoid exceeding speed limits, they could also be registering your license plate data. According to a federal contract from the [US government](URL recently disclosed entitled Radar Speed Display Trailers the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is expected to expand the scope of its national surveillance network with the acquisition of multiple trailer-mounted speed screens to be adapted as a license plate reader platform (LPR). The contractor for these systems is U2 systems INC., a private company in Meza, Arizona. Two small machine shops in California and Virginia were also used to hide readers within the traffic signs. The DEA expects to receive these new traffic signals this week. **Can this be considered as mass surveillance?** This DEA program is nothing new. The National Plate Reader program was launched almost ten years ago to improve the efficiency of police agencies to intercept drug or money smugglers or other criminal activities in the United States. This program is mainly aimed at monitoring the Southwest border region and the northeast and southeast corridors of the country. However, although this may be an effective crime-fighting tool for some government agencies, [digital forensics](URL experts and information privacy advocates are concerned about the possible implications of the massive use of these cameras. These modern devices are amazingly fast. They can capture about 2000 plates per minute; this speed can be invaluable to the police at the time of chasing a criminal but, on the other hand, the advocates of privacy say that the authorities can store this information and use it later for data extraction purposes. Experts say that collecting data from the general public is not the problem. What the authorities do with that kind of information that is troubling. In addition, experts criticize the amount of information collected by the United States government. Meanwhile, police agencies mention that none of this data is used to spy on American citizens. One of his arguments is that no one knows if someone is going to commit a crime, so the data must be retained forever, because you never know exactly when it might be needed. For the digital forensics experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security, it is still unclear how legal this activity is, while many other specialists on the subject claim this is clearly an illegal measure by the US government."

According to experts in digital forensics, victims payment card information would have been obtained through a compromised website that would have gone unnoticed for months. British Airways would discover the security breach while investigating the data theft of its website that was raised last September, an event that affected about 380k transactions of the company. International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways, has reported that both attacks have apparently been deployed by the same group of hackers. The company added that it would contact customers over the next few weeks to inform them of the situation in which their information is found. **Financial impact** Information on the security breach was revealed in a stock exchange announcement by International Airlines Group. The company said that the previous attack took place between April 21 and July 28. The incident only affected customers who made reservations using the rewards of the British Airways loyalty program. International Airlines Group mentions that those affected by security violations can be classified into two different groups: * 77k people suffered the theft of data such as name, address, email address and detailed payment information * 108k people lost their personal data and, in addition, the security code of their payment cards was extracted Few additional details about this theft have been revealed so far. According to experts in digital forensics, in early September British Airways reported that its website and its application had been compromised between August 21 and September 5. About 380k people were involved in this incident, including payment card details used by 244k affected users. Since the announcement published in September, British Airways can confirm that there have been no verified cases of fraud, the company said in a statement. The September attack prompted an investigation by the United Kingdoms National Crime Agency and the Office of the Commissioner of Information. British Airways and International Airlines Group could face huge penalties as the violation occurred after strict European privacy and data standards, known as the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), came into force. According to experts in [digital forensics](URL from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the group behind these attacks could be the hacker organization known as Magecart, which would have created a customized infrastructure to adapt to the site British Airways website and mobile app specifically and avoid detection for as long as possible. Although it is not possible to know how much information the attackers accessed on the British Airways servers, the fact that they were able to modify a resource for the website using only 22 lines of code, suggests that the access was substantial.

The hacker, who calls himself L.M., revealed to a digital media that he gained access to the servers of TheTruthSpy, a company that sells an Android and iOS spy app (known as stalkerware). The hacker was able to steal logins and passwords, images, audio recordings intercepted from victims phones, text messages, location information and social network chats, among other data. I have control over victims all around the world, the hacker said a few months ago, when it was revealed that he had compromised the companys information. L.M. shared to the media a sample of usernames and logins of TheTruthSpy clients. This way, cyber security organization experts were able to verify that about half of them were active TheTruthSpy accounts when trying to use the respective email addresses to create a new account. In many cases this was not possible, because the website mentioned that the user already existed. They care about how to spy, but dont care about how to secure their users and victims privacy, mentioned the hacker. L.M. also mentioned that he recently lost access to the site when TheTruthSpy updated its servers. L.M. said he could hack into the companys media server after reverse-engineering the Android app and finding a serious vulnerability. The hacker warned that many of TheTruthSpy customers used the same passwords for their email, PayPal or Amazon accounts, mentioning that he entered those accounts but did not steal money. This is the seventh company that sells spyware to common users to be hacked over the last two years. Many hackers have focused their attacks on the fragile consumer spyware industry, exposing their mediocre cyber security organization and questionable ethics. TheTruthSpy has often been used as an example of questionable actor in the industry. The companys blog announces its products as a solution for spying on a cheater husband mentioning that the software is undetectable and silent. Although there are several companies that sell programs to spy on their lower-quality partners in the market, there are some genuine products worth considering. One of my favorite programs to spy on my partner is TheTruthSpy, known for its quality and novel features, mentions a companys blog post. The founder of StealthGenie, another company that commercialized software for domestic abusers, was arrested and charged in 2014. In the United States, selling spyware to parents or employers is not considered illegal, but if a company sells its product to adults for use with other adults, that is considered a crime. Cyber security organization specialists mention that undue access to this information could be very dangerous; a hacker can know everything about anybody and also know the identity of the domestic abuser, which makes them easy victims to online extortion and other cybercrimes."

Security reports claim that the compromised device was a Cisco 800 Series router, with iOS 12.4, which stopped receiving updates since 2016. The robbery was publicly disclosed after the Russian political and financial newspaper Kommersant reported on July 6 that PIR Bank lost at least 58M rubles ($920K) and possibly much more, after hackers transferred money from the account of the Bank of Russia, which is the central bank of the country. PIR Bank was reportedly able to recover some funds, but most of the money transferred seems to have been disappeared. Robbery research Further details about the attack have been published by the expert group in enterprise data protection services in charge of the case investigation. Based on the techniques used by the hackers, such as the use of PowerShell scripts to gain persistence in the banks networks and automate some steps of the hack process, it is believed that the Russian gang MoneyTaker is responsible for the attack. MoneyTaker is one of Russias three most active cyber crime gangs, the others being Cobalt and Silence, which regularly direct their attacks to the financial services sector. Specialists in enterprise data protection services add that this is at least the fourth time this year that MoneyTaker has been able to access a banks network by exploiting one of its routers. A report on MoneyTaker was published in December 2017 affirming that the gang primarily targets small community banks, and that, since 2016, it would have stolen nearly $10M from at least 20 financial services firms, based in Russia, United Kingdom and the United States. How do hackers got into the bank`s network? Specialists in enterprise data protection services believe that the attack began in mid-May, exploiting the router in question, which does not require further technical efforts, as it could be intervened simply with a brute force attack. From the router to the net After the router exploiting, the hackers used it to tunnel through the banks main network. From there, they managed to access the the automated workstation client of the central Bank of Russia, which is an interbank messaging system designed for transfers of funds similar to the SWIFT system. After accessing the automated workstation, hackers were able to generate payment orders and send money in several tranches to the different pre-established accounts."

According to reports of enterprise data protection services experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the financial institution is suing its insurance provider for refusing to cover the losses completely. According to a lawsuit filed last month in Virginias West District, the first heist took place in May 2016, after an employee of the National Bank of Blacksburg fell into a spare phishing mail. The mail allowed hackers to install malware on the victims PC and jeopardize a second computer in the bank that had access to the red STAR, a system run by the financial industry giant First Data, which the bank uses to manage Debit card transactions for customers. That second computer had the ability to manage National Bank customer accounts and its use of ATMs and bank cards. According to the Bank, thanks to this access hackers were able to disable and tamper with anti-theft and antifraud protections, such as personal identification numbers (PIN), daily withdrawal limits, daily debit card usage limits, and protections against fraud. After this event, the National Bank hired the information security forensics firm Foregenix to investigate. The company determined that the tools of the hackers and the activity seemed to come from Russian Internet addresses. In June 2016, the National Bank implemented additional security protocols, recommended by FirstData. These protocols were implemented to help the bank identify specific types of repeat transaction patterns that occur in a short period of time. But only eight months later, in January 2017, hackers broke into the banks systems once again, regaining access to the financial institutions systems via phishing e-mail. This time, the attackers not only regained access to the banks STAR network, but also managed to compromise a workstation that had access to Navigator, a software used by National Bank to manage credits and debits in costumers accounts. Before executing the second heist, hackers used the banks Navigator system to fraudulently credit more than $2M to several National Bank accounts. As with the first incident, the hackers executed their heist on a weekend. Between January 9 and 7, hackers modified or eliminated security checks and withdrew fraudulent credits using hundreds of ATMs. According to enterprise data protection services, while cash withdrawal occurred, hackers used the banks systems to monitor customer accounts from which funds were withdrawn. At the end of the robbery, hackers used their access to remove evidence of fraudulent debits from customer accounts. The total loss reported by the Bank for that violation was $1,833,984. This time, Verizon was hired to investigate the attack and according to the bank, the companys forensics concluded that the tools and servers used by hackers were of Russian origin. The lawsuit points out that Verizon determined that it was probably the same group of hackers responsible for both intrusions. In its lawsuit, the national Bank says to have an insurance policy with Everest National Insurance Company for protection against cyber crime losses. The first insurance, against computer and electronic crimes, had a single limit of liability for loss of $8M, with a deductible of $125K. The second provided coverage for losses resulting directly from the use of lost, stolen or altered debit cards or counterfeit cards, as reported by experts in enterprise data protection services."

According to reports of experts in enterprise data protection services from the International Institute of Cyber Security, these incidents have increased by 32% between the first quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. The frequency of these attacks is thought to be directly related to the availability of ready-to-use malicious programs. Information security experts have analyzed about 25 dark web sites to determine the cost of the major cyber crime services, from the most simple to the most complex. With Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access tools sold on dark web for $10, computer users have seen how easily their computers can be compromised. However, these low-cost tools do not stop in RDP, and some complex services are at incredibly low prices: E-mail hack: $40 DoS Attack: $50 Website hacking: $150 Theft of payment card information: $270 Infection with mining trojan: $300 Infection with ransomware trojan: $750 ATM theft: $1500 Targeted attack: $4500 Starting with $40, hackers can infiltrate a companys email and steal confidential information. With such a low price for attacks, these criminal acts are no longer directed only at large companies. Specialists in enterprise data protection services say that about 71% of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are not prepared to face cybersecurity risks, and with the cheapness of organizing an attack, they need to get the proper defense. Big companies are not safe either. Since the costs are so low, hackers could buy multiple attack services to target large companies from different angles. If hackers cant afford the biggest and most dangerous attacks, they can still do damage with several smaller attacks. As you can see, company security, no matter if its a small or large company, is under constant threat due to the large amount and accessibility of resources for malicious agents use, it is the responsibility of employers to establish contact with enterprise data protection services experts to know the best options to guarantee the security of their companys information."

The spokesperson from the Idaho Department of Corrections, Jeff Ray, says the departments Special Investigations Unit discovered the problem earlier this month, and that the crime did not involve taxpayer funds. According to reports from experts in enterprise data protection services, JPay is a service provided for different correction institutions that provides support technology in activities such as money transfer, email and video call visits. The service can transfer money through an electronic payment system that includes credit and debit payments on an inmates account. These tablets are popular in prisons along the country and are available to Idaho inmates through a contract with CenturyLink and JPay. None of the companies have made further statements about the incident. The spokesman said in his statement that the prisoners were intentionally exploiting some vulnerability within the JPay system to unduly increase their JPay account balances. He added that 50 inmates credited amounts exceeding $1K in their accounts; the largest amount found in a single-prisoner account was a little less than $10K. The total amount of the robbery was almost $225K. Individuals involved in the robbery are held at the Idaho State Correctional Facility, Idaho State Correctional Center, Idaho Correctional Facility, southern Idaho Correctional Facility, and in the facilities of the Alternative Correctional Placement, operated by the private prison company MTC Inc. For specialists in enterprise data protection services from the International Institute of Cyber Security, this is a very serious security flaw, as the inmates were able to build a network capable of compromising software contracted by correctional institutions that may be not secure enough to work with."

According to CNBC, Musk sent an e-mail to Teslas employees last Sunday, revealing that a co worker was engaged in a fairly extensive and damaging sabotage against the company. The agency published what seems to be a copy of the message in which Musk reported that the attack included the use of false usernames to change the codes used in Teslas operating and manufacturing system, as well as exporting a large amount of sensitive information to unknown third parties. As Musk points out, when an individual collaborates in this kind of attack, the motive is usually revenge. His stated motive is that he wanted a promotion he did not receive. After these actions, not promoting him was definitely the right move, said the CEO. According to information security training specialists, this is a major reminder as to why privileged access management is mandatory for organizations that handle sensitive and personal information. Nevertheless, a recent survey for information security training and information technology professionals ranked in a low position this kind of threats, whit just the 36% considering malicious insiders as a serious threat.

The malware was also promoted by its use of anti-analysis techniques to discourage white hat hackers capable of conducting pentest to examine their internal functioning. Kardon appears to be a brand change of the ZeroCool bots Network, which was developed by the same people. The creators of the malware do not distribute it widely, so far there are only 124 infections detected, but the researchers found that the attackers have been doing tests recently.

The investigator detected the malware for the first time on April 21, 2018, after an attacker using the name Yattaze began to advertise the malware in a forum. Botnets creators have reported a future development for the malware and, meanwhile, pentest experts recommend that organizations leverage indicators to block malicious activity associated with the malware. On the other hand, Sean Newman, director of Product Development at Coreo Network Security, says that this way of creating botnets does not represent any change in the way cyber crime works, because we have exceeded the time when hackers had to built their own tools for their attacks, with hackers specialized in certain areas and trading their tools or skills in dark web, cyber crime has become a much wider environment.

The UK government has announced the establishment of a specialized court to hear cases related to cyber crime, as reported by pentest experts. The agreement was signed between the City of London and the judiciary and it will end with the establishment of a centre of 18 courts, the British government said last Wednesday. Announced for the first time in October and now approved, this court will be built from scratch on Fleet Street. According to pentest specialists, the new center will replace the civil court, the mayors County court and the City of London court, and the Court of Magistrates of the City of London in these cases. A new police station has also been included in the agreement. The specially designed court will deal with civil, commercial and property cases. Chancellor David Gauke said the agreement represents a message to the world that Britain values business and is ready to deal with the changing nature of the crime of the 21st century. This is a significant step in the project that will give Square Mile its second iconic Palace of Justice after the Old Bailey, added Catherine McGuinness, President of London City Policy. I am particularly pleased that this court is focusing on the legal problems of the future, such as fraud, economic crime and computer crimes.

Whit the pass of time, the diffusion of darknets has created new illegal business models. Along with classic illegal goods such as drugs and payment card data, other services appeared in the criminal underground, including hacking services and malware development. New platforms allow crooks without any technical skills to create their own ransomware and spread it. When ransomware is installed on a victim machine, it searches for and targets sensitive files and data, including financial data, databases and personal files. Ransomwares are developed to make the victims machine unusable. The user has only two options: pay the ransom without having the guarantee of getting back the original files or format the PC disconnecting it from the Internet. The rise of the RaaS business model is giving the criminals an effortless way to launch a cyber-extortion campaign without having technical expertise. Ransomware-as-a-Service is a profitable model for both malware sellers and their customers. Malware sellers, using this approach, can acquire new infection vectors and could potentially reach new victims that they are not able to reach through a conventional approach, such as email spamming or compromised website. RaaS customers can easily obtain ransomware via Ransomware-as-a-Service portals, just by configuring a few features and distributing the malware to unwitting victims. Surfing the dark web through unconventional search engines, you can find several websites that offer RaaS. Each one provides different features for their ransomware allowing users to select the file extensions considered by the encrypting phase; the ransom demanded to the victim and other technical functionality that the malware will implement. Moreover, beyond the usage of Ransomware-as-a-Service platforms, the purchase of custom malicious software can be made through crime forums or websites where one can hire a hacker for the creation of ones personal malware, information security researchers say. Historically, this commerce has always existed, but it was specialized into cyber-attacks, such as espionage, hack of accounts and website defacement. Only when hackers understood it could be profitable, they started to provide this specific service.

According to the survey conducted ahead of information security training researchers of Black Hat Asia in Singapore, 52% of nearly 100 respondents either strongly agree that such an attack would happen in their own country in the next two years. An even greater proportion (67%) believed that an attack affecting critical infrastructure across multiple Asian countries will happen in the same period. As in Black Hat surveys conducted in the US and Europe, [information security training](URL professionals in the study were concerned that recent incidents in their region might indicate that a major breach of critical infrastructure is forthcoming. Past attacks in the Middle East and Asia had spanned damage to industrial control systems, data theft for surveillance purposes, and hacking of computers used to support critical infrastructure in Asian countries. APT37, the North Korean cyber espionage group, for example, had already expanded its operations beyond the Korean peninsula to include Japan, Vietnam and the Middle East. Another campaign, reported by information security researchers at Nyotron, was focused on stealing data from industrial control systems in the Middle East for the purpose of conducting surveillance. The gloomy threat landscape had led 23% of respondents to believe that cyber espionage by large nation states poses the greatest threat to APACs critical infrastructure, followed by potential attacks by organized crime groups (21%). Information security training managers in APAC were also more concerned about sophisticated attacks aimed at their organizations than any other threat, followed by social engineering exploits and polymorphic malware that evades signature-based defenses. The Black Hat Asia survey also threw up some surprises. For example, only 19% identified ransomware and other forms of online extortion as a top current concern in two years despite heightened publicity around the topic, but the 38% of respondents pointed to the rapid increase in the use of ransomware as the top threat in the past year. Like their counterparts in the US and Europe, APAC cyber security leaders were not confident of their ability to deal with looming threats. More than half of them said they were either a little under budget or severely hampered in their ability to fight threats because of a lack of funds. The shortage of [information security training](URL staff had also made it harder to fend off current threats as reported by 58% of respondents. Out of those, 17% admitted they were completely underwater; 3% said they had no staff; and 38% said they could use a little additional help. The skills shortage was the most worrying finding for the information security training professionals. According to the survey, over half of cyber security professionals in the region said they were either actively looking for a new job or open to it. Across the region, nearly 40% said users who violated security policies or fell prey to phishing and social engineering scams had kept them up at night. Compliance with privacy rules such as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Privacy Framework was also one of the top items in their security budgets and daily activity lists."

Private individuals and big businesses alike should constantly be looking at the latest trends and emerging threats in an increasingly connected age, [information security](URL experts said. Its vital that the business is doing all that it can to beat the cyber criminals and protect the company and those that it employs and provides for. Here are the two biggest security threats that you need to be aware of in 2018. Ransomware in the Cloud Ransomware allows criminals to deny official users access to their own data, and will usually result in a payment in order to regain access, information security professionals explain. It has been a major issue and is made even more so by the fact that so many businesses are making use of cloud-based services for their data-storage. Its vital that you protect your cloud access as much as possible. This will come down to staff training on basic security, such as password or passphrase generation and the need for personal devices to remain as secure as business devices. Data Breach &amp; Human Error No matter how technologically advanced the cyber criminals become; the biggest issue is still your employees. From clicking on a corrupted link in an email to using the same passwords across every platform of your company, your staff members are the number one cause of data breaches. If you struggle to maintain an awareness of common security issues, then it may be time to make use of a security partner when it comes to your IT strategies. Turn to expert support available to help with cyber security, and you will free up your staff and yourself, enabling you to prioritize your workload in more profitable directions.

This is clear from the last report presented in 2018, which states that a total of 4,021 million people worldwide have access to the internet. A panorama that favors that the kilometers are not an impediment for the new society of the information and the communication, but that creates a new scene for old problems, like the harassment. harrasment In fact, according to a study by several information security companies, among the main fears of parents is that their children may be victims of cyberbullying, before they communicate with strangers or share personal information with strangers. Therefore, it is important to know what exactly this phenomenon consists of and what measures can be taken to stop it, an objective pursued by Secure Internet Day, created by the European Union to raise awareness of internet risks. Cyberharassment, sexual cyberbullying or cyberbullying Experts of the International Institute of Cyber Security, specialized in information security said that we must distinguish the types of harassment that occur on the Internet: cyberharassment, sexual cyberbullying and cyberbullying. In the first case, we are facing harassment between adults in a strict sense, while for sexual cyberbullying the sexual purpose of the comments must be clear. Finally, the cyberbullying implies that the harassment occurs between minors. In these three cases, one of the following behaviors must be repeated: the persecution and the search for their closeness, the intention to establish contact, the misuse of personal data and the violation of the freedom and assets of the alleged victim, according to experts in information security. In general, any behavior or action aimed at restricting the freedom of the taxpayer is enough when the latter is not obliged to support this situation, says the expert. The responsibility of social networks Although there are notable differences between media, social networks and forums, roughly speaking, responsibility will be defined by three decisive factors: effective knowledge and due diligence of the portal owner, the nature of the activity developed and the capacity of control and moderation on the contents of others , according to this collaborator of an information security company. However, the concept of effective content has been qualified by Justice in the sense that a Service Provider of the Information Society (anyone who has a website) cannot be a content judge of its own portal . Therefore, there is a need for comments that violate fundamental rights to be indisputable, clear and flagrant. Therefore, most portals such as Twitter, Facebook or YouTube have to be alerted by users about inappropriate content, although they are developing policies against hate messages, racism, xenophobia or extremism. What the stalker faces We are facing a criminal offense that can lead to jail. Harassment will be punishable by imprisonment from three months to two years or a fine of six to 24 months. If the person is especially vulnerable because of their age, illness or situation, the prison term of six months to two years will be imposed and the fine will not be applicable in any case. In the event that the harassed and the harasser have joined an affective relationship with or without cohabitation, or when the messages are directed to descendants and ascendants and even to relatives of the ex-spouse, a prison term of one to two years will be imposed or social service from 60 to 120 days. bullying implications Precautions for social networks If you think you may be facing a case of cyberbullying, keep in mind the following guidelines that an information security expert of WebImprints recommends: Before reporting, certify the bullys messages with a time stamp. To inform the Cyber Crimes Unit of the Police of the facts. Do not erase any text. Save emails, abusive instant messaging chats etc. Ignore those messages that seek provocation. Do not answer. Save the repetitive ones without leaving a reading trail. When fewer personal data have been provided, minors are the chances of harassment. Profiles with usernames and sexualized avatars are more prone to harassment. Do not talk privately with people you do not know and be especially careful with the photos. Read the conditions of use and privacy of social networks where you have a profile. 10. Install programs against malware that do not expose you to harassment on all devices."
