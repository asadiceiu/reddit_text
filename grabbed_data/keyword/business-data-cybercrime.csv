But it becomes more difficult when you have to keep your data secure from security breaches while working with an overseas team. &gt;*It so happens that work which is likely to be our most durable monument, and to convey some knowledge of us to the most remote posterity, is a work of bare utility; not a shrine, not a fortress, not a palace, but a bridge.* *Montgomerry Schuyler* With technology companies and employees have the flexibility to work from anywhere. Tech makes us able to work remotely or even as a remote team, keep up-to-date with the office while travelling and to facilitate a great work/life balance. It makes your work-life easy but also poses a question about data security risks as well. ## Remote Working Security Risks There are many security risks in remote work like -Hacking or social engineering, Phishing, Malware, and Ransomware, etc. So while hiring a remote team, always remember to tell them to keep cautious about these securities risks. The security of the client information and the firms server are the biggest concern. So your security parameters should be very high and updated. ### Hacking Or Social Engineering: ***Social engineering*** is the art of manipulating people so they give up confidential information, which includes your passwords and bank information as well as giving them control over your computer. These attacks can be placed for Ransome or evading your best practices. If a social engineer hacked one persons email password and get access to that persons contact list because most people use similar passwords everywhere, so the hacker can get easy access to all the sites, applications, contacts, and other useful information as well of that person. These social engineering attacks look like an email from a friend or another trusted source and can contain a link to downloadable content. People generally dont suspect their known contacts and get easily trapped by hackers. ### Phishing: Phishing is the most common and popular method to steal others credentials. It is a cybercrime in which attackers create as a legitimate institution to induce people for providing sensitive data such as personally identifiable information, banking, and credit card details and passwords. Imagine a website that looks just like Facebook, where you log in, thinking its the real thing. Phishing is when an attacker creates a website that looks legitimate but isnt. Phishing is a subset of social engineering strategy that imitates a trusted source for creating a phoney source to hand you over login credentials or other sensitive personal data.

1,cybercrime,business,How the Rise of ID Verification Promises Trillions of Dollars for Online Marketplace?,2,c4kv0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/c4kv0k/how_the_rise_of_id_verification_promises/,2019-06-24 19:45:18,"The affliction of cybercrimes and online frauds has reached such high proportions that the cost of it left the billion figure years ago and the damages have now entered trillions of dollars. Cybercrime ended up costing $3 trillion dollars to the commercial sector in 2015. This number is expected to cross $6 trillion by 2021. More to the fact that cybercrimes are the fastest growing crimes in the US; in that, fraudsters are increasingly enhancing and advancing ways to compromise a businesss cybersecurity measures. All these figures and the gravity of the situation requires enterprises and governments to take a more proactive than reactive approach to avert frauds and cyber attacks. The rise of ID verification systems, in particular, can play an important role in having a productive economic impact for businesses by not just helping to curb fraud but also reducing expenditures. &amp;#x200B; URL However, fraud prevention is not the only plus side of having an identity verification system. An online identification system can help reduce costs, ultimately increasing revenues for a business. It also enables businesses to meet their compliance and regulatory requirement, which they are bound to fulfil by law. Thus, identification systems can potentially save trillions of dollars for the online marketplace. ## A Decrease in Transactional and Admin Costs Both the financial services sector, as well as commercial businesses, have generally relied on outdated manual or legacy systems for transactions and payment systems. Such methods are costly and, not to mention, unsafe considering the current fraud landscape. Compared with digital identity systems, in-person identity verification can also be costly for the business as well as the consumer. For instance, if a person wishing to open a bank account needs to present a certain set of identity documents for the bank to ensure that the person has legitimate and verifiable credentials. Having to verify their identity in-person has both time and monetary costs for a consumer, not to mention that each visit costs the financial institute $4.25. Compared to this, a digital identification system allows a person to authenticate their document and other credentials electronically, thus saving them both time and money Not to mention the fact that a single mobile transaction costs only $0.10. Thus, the customer onboarding process can be made more efficient through an automated ID verification service. Eliminating the need for paper-based verification procedures for each individual client, it can greatly reduce the time for onboarding a new customer. ## Preventing Fraud Through ID Verification As discussed above, online frauds are the bane of an online enterprise or a financial institutions existence. The sort of losses they incur to businesses can be detrimental. The costs of identity theft alone were reaching $221 billion worldwide. The financial sector or the online market cannot afford such losses. A sound online identification system, being fast and effective, can allow a business to detect fraud while it takes place, thus preventing any chargebacks or fines. A bank or financial institute can verify their clients during the onboarding process and make sure they have legitimate documents and other credentials. For an online business, an [identity verification system](URL allows merchants to identify fraudsters who are using fake or stolen credit cards or identity documents. &amp;#x200B; URL Another major fraud risk is synthetic identity fraud, wherein the criminal generally uses someones social security number to build an identity for him/herself. An effective ID verification software can also alleviate synthetic identity fraud. Also, by increasing cooperation between national databases and the private sector can help eliminate the use of fake credentials and identities altogether. ## Reducing Compliance Costs Sectors that are closely regulated including the financial services sector, online payment systems and the healthcare industry. In an effort to develop a framework that meets their regulatory obligations, they have to invest in ample resources. However, with slow and ineffective ID verification systems, their compliance costs are only susceptible to increase. Such businesses are not only in need of preventing fraud and reducing transactional and onboarding costs, but they are also legally bound to fulfil certain compliance requirements. Governments and regulatory authorities issue guidelines for businesses to implement in order to curb financial crimes like money laundering. Such obligations need to be fulfilled by businesses efficiently. &amp;#x200B; The financial services sector spends greatly on building effective compliance structures. However, manual procedures for verification have proven to be ineffective and slow. Implementing an automated system for customer due diligence and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance can not only reduce costs for businesses but also effectively reduce financial crimes. It is also prudent to mention that companies that fail to implement adequate KYC and AML procedures have to face hefty fines from regulatory bodies, both national and international. Thus, implementing an effective online ID verification system can avoid these costs for a business as well."

3,cybercrime,business,a viable peer-to-peer currency,1,6yl4nv,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/6yl4nv/a_viable_peertopeer_currency/,2017-09-07 14:58:42,"Cryptocurrency (the most infamous being Bitcoin) has been hailed as the next generation of currency. I believe the founding fathers of this technology may have the best interest of the public at heart (or so we were told). However, I do notice the BTC's limitations and flaws. For one, the blockchain as a public ledger is clunky and inefficient; the inevitability of natural forks, and scalability issues, are testament to this. IMO, the inability to reverse payments is also a joke. And its volatility undermines its use as a day-to-day currency. Most ""adapters"" are, in reality, speculative ""investors"", and have never even used BTC in its touted use: for commodity exchange. We have a perfectly viable peer-to-peer system in the form of torrents. In fact, this peer-to-peer system has endured the test of time, and IMO may be worth a second look in creating a truly viable online currency. However, there is a bigger picture to the technology: BTC, since it is anonymous to a certain degree, has been widely used in cybercrime. Torrents are also notoriously connected to piracy. These technologies have been tainted in the eyes of the law, however, we may be able to salvage them yet for the common good. My proposal : to create a viable, usable online currency using a peer-to-peer network, not necessarily employing blockchain technology, but a next-generation iteration, using the best parts of blockchain and torrents. I am not a programmer. I see myself more as a visionary. I will admit, the technicalities of the tech still elude me. I wish to continue this conversation with people more in the know. Is there any sub in reddit to discuss this further? Hoping to meet a person / group that I can bounce ideas on... "
