My server has secured boot- disabled. So understand that already vulnerable to other boot loader defects? But how realistic such boot loader/grub related attacks are? Insider attack? 2. Now, if I want to enable secure boot options are there really critical CVEs against it so that I am defending against by enabling it? I want to experiment to know how easy/difficult to exploit. 3. Just turning on secure boot suffices on BIOS settings or need digital certificates etc for point number 2? Is there a procedure for it? Thank you very much for your suggestions."

(CVE-2009-3555)(CVE-2011-1473). I am looking this to exploit against Linux sever. Is there any known metaspoilt exploit or other know methods for creating either about Mitm or DOS as CVEs reveal to ?
