X marks the spot. IT journalists are under-reporting the significance of the first patch Tuesday after Windows 7 went out of support. Starting tomorrow, black hats will be releasing Windows 7 malware based on reverse engineered Windows 10 security patches from today. This is a much more impactful event than the end of support last month. I will be interesting to see how many more 0day CVEs come out in the next week aimed at Windows 7."

First post here. I have been working as a Security Engineer for about 6 months now, and I am the ONLY resource at my company that does this kind of work. As such, I am solely tasked with assisting clients with security related issues, making recommendations, etc. Recently, one of our clients requested a risk analysis. Being CompTIA PenTest+ and CySA+ certified, I am expected to perform a full analysis for this client site. I have no senior officials to lean on, and i'm kind of nervous about undertaking such a large task. I am working backwards through my methodology (Identify Vulnerabilities, Identify Threat, Determine likelihood of threat actualization, determine impact of threat actualization, and evaluate overall risk). Trouble is, I have no clue what industry standard tools and software are recommended to perform these tasks. I could just do nmap scans and match CVEs to services that are running, but that feels like half-ass results with full-ass effort. I could use the Nessus scanner, but I have to convince my boss to pay for it because we don't currently have it. I could go in and work through it like a PenTest, but i'd have to go through the waver and legal process with our client. I'm sure this board has some GREAT input on this, so let's hear it. If this is inappropriately posted here, please let me know which board would be more suitable for this topic."
4,CVEs,security,Differentiating vulnerabilities between Microsoft Office and Microsoft Office applications,2,cnpy01,https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/cnpy01/differentiating_vulnerabilities_between_microsoft/,2019-08-09 04:37:33,"Looking through cvedetails\[.\]com, if you filter down to Microsoft vulnerabilities it lists the products separately. Namely, The entry for ""Office"" contains 531 CVEs. Each Office application (Word, Excel, etc), has their own number of CVEs broken out. Then, Office 365 and Office 365 ProPlus have 3 and 41, respectively. Now, I haven't broken these out and parsed through for overlap, which I'm sure is there, but my question is, are Office, Office 365, and Office 365 ProPlus all distinct entities vulnerable in unique ways from the Office applications themselves? My understanding is that the applications are vulnerable, the ""Office"" names just refer to them as a group. Why, for example, are the ""affected"" products listed for CVE-2019-1112 as Office and Office 365, but the vulnerability is an Excel bug? Am I just overthinking it?"

Does any such career exist? Thank you all in advance! [PS (optional read) my dream job is to be a security researcher and get some CVEs under my belt someday. I just want to continue both my security and code skills till I get there. Thank you for hearing me out!]"

7,CVEs,security,Monitoring GitHub for sensitive data?,4,961w94,https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/961w94/monitoring_github_for_sensitive_data/,2018-08-10 10:02:21," So I've been tasked with a 2 folded task. 1.) Monitor GitHub repos for commits with sensitive data. 2.) Find a way to prevent them from being committed in the first place. While I would prefer all open source diy solutions 1.) Are there any Enterprise / professional services that do this? My Google fu is failing me here and I've only found 2 such external service: [Black duck](URL and [Gitmonkey](URL Codacy mentions security in their SCA but I can't seem to find any more info other than ""we implement these open source engines that have security in mind"". While they mention security monitoring I don't know if it's just flagging out of date dependencies with CVEs, measuring entropy and flagging commits, or some regex search and match. I also can't seem to find if they go through all of GitHub , just your master branch of your repos, or digs through commits. So just lack of clarity from commercial products. 2.) What are the best practices in terms of A.) Monitoring GitHub for exposure and B.) Preventing exposure to begin with (breaking builds/preventing commits/pushes / etc) I am a complete newbie to Git and GitHub but after looking around everyone seems to recommended implementing githooks and enforcing good policies. I asked some devs and they all seem to say this isn't effective as these are client side and require a bit of setup per repo. Our lead dev (as well as the rest of the devs) has exposed creds a few times already. We roll creds and scrub GitHub but it's starting to become too tedious. Does anyone have any open source recommended projects to help with this? This is what I've found so far but I'm too new to find out which projects are worth it Project -- latest commit -- notes:: URL  Dec 17th, 2017  URL  Jul 5th, 2018  popular URL  Apr 19th, 2018  made by aws team URL  Aug 6th, 2018  Has aws cred and ssh key hooks URL URL  May 13th, 2018  entropy scanner now supports regex searching URL Jul 16th, 2016  Based on gitrob but lightweight search through org + commits Ideally I would have a webui + database for managing flagged commits/events/excludes (ie test data/uuids).

Sorry for the barf my brain is fried. "

I have a small role in security validation. I write software tools that decompile and deconstruct thousands of other tools and libraries in order to manually ensure compliance (proper compiler flags, which libraries are included, that certain libraries never get included, etc...) Recently (since the start of the new year) I am aware of multiple governments getting detailed tours of our validation process. This has resulted in us getting a great deal more enforcement power to push developers and product managers to actually act on our alerts and warnings. Any given tool usually has between 10 and 15 minor to moderate CVEs associated with any given release, but getting anyone responsible to take these vulnerabilities seriously (act on anything) has always been a bit challenging. This seems to be getting pressure from the top (outside pressure) to change. My question is: are any of you aware of what is driving this? Sure, I can speculate as well as anyone else, but hard facts are a bit harder to come by. This seems to be pretty big, but I haven't seen any coverage on it. Rumors include pseudo-official word of large incentives, world funding shifts, additional contracts (or contracts being threatened by) proper enforcement, etc..."
