Has that number reached safer levels? Will we also ever know how it could be exploited?
1,CVE-,Bitcoin,The guide how to troll e-mail spammers using bitcoin ;),19,bxm51z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/bxm51z/the_guide_how_to_troll_email_spammers_using/,2019-06-07 07:18:33,"Today i've got such spam mail in my inbox: &amp;#x200B; &gt;Hi. I think you will not be happy, because I have a very bad news for you. Just a few months ago (06/03/2019) I hacked your operating system and I have full control of your device. I implanted a small application into your device which sends me your current IP address and allows me to connect to your device just like remote desktop. Even if you change your password, it wont help. How I infected you? The router that you used to connect to Internet had a security hole. You can read about this problem by searching for CVE-2018-10562. I hacked your router and I put my code into it, and when you tried to connect to Internet, my program infected your device. Later I made a full copy of your hard drive (I have all your email contact lists, list of websites you visited, phone numbers, your passwords etc.) A little while later, when I was searching your web browsing history I was shocked by what I saw!! The sites for adults you are visiting... you know what I mean... I just want to say - your fantasies are shifted far away from the normal course!... For the last 2 months I have been spying on you through your device camera.. especially when you visited those sites to have fun... Those videos show clearly you having fun and the content for adults you were watching.. this is pretty nasty and I would be very worried if I were you. I have secured 4 videos: 1554725936.mp4 (92.6 MB) 1558498010.mp4 (56.0 MB) 1558237380.mp4 (31.5 MB) 1555091017.mp4 (80.5 MB) You can verify that the timestamps correspond to the moments you were enjoying yourself... Now, because I do not like at all what I saw (thats pretty crazy and ugly) I ask you to send me a donation through Bitcoin network. 2000 US dollars is a fair price (considering your perversions). If you want me to forget about the whole case, remove the files and disable the nasty app that is spying you, send me the Bitcoin payment within 72 hours. Yes, I give you 72 hours only. Here is my wallet: ======================================= Send exactly 0.297652 BTC to my address: 34KSU1zrgvNA7JgDjjsw9txechp4vxnXCG (copy it and paste - its case sensitive) ======================================= 0.297652 BTC = 2000 dollars If you do not send me the Bitcoin, I promise you - I will send those 4 files with you enjoying yourself to all your contact lists, associates and social network friends. I still have access to your device and I know when you read this message. When you opened it, time started ticking. You have 72 hours only! I am from Russia and nobody will help you if you report this email.. Before they find me your life will be ruined! If you do not cooperate with me - I will release this ugly material immediately. This is why I advise you - send me the Bitcoin and lets forget about the whole situation. I know you can afford it. If you do not know how to send bitcoin, go to google and search how to do it. There are plenty of options like coinbase. Here is my address again: ======================================= Send exactly: 0.297652 BTC to my address: 34KSU1zrgvNA7JgDjjsw9txechp4vxnXCG ======================================= Remember to send the exact amount as above! This way I will know its from you. Do not be angry at me. This is just my job, and you are not the only person I caught. Be angry at your fantasies - if you didnt visit those sites for adults you would have no problem.. but now... I am waiting for your bitcoin. Remember, time is ticking.. --   .  .   .   .  . &amp;#x200B; well, there is a way how to waste your own money and blockchain space using vanitygen addresses: [URL &amp;#x200B; dear hacker, if you read this, i hope you'll get the humor! &amp;#x200B; friendly reminder to all readers: do not pay those spammers ever. the only thing they know about you is your e-mail. anything else is bullshit even if it is true what they wrote"
2,CVE-,Bitcoin,A list and reviews of some good bitcoin podcasts,1,a3yobf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/a3yobf/a_list_and_reviews_of_some_good_bitcoin_podcasts/,2018-12-07 21:23:57,"I must have listened hundreds of hours to bitcoin podcasts this year and wanted to share some of my favourite ones. Hopefully it will be helpful for someone to decide with the allocation of their precious time, so here are my recommendations, in no particular order. Blockdigest - a bi-weekly podcast, with focus on current events in the space. Most of the knowledgeable and ethical people around; no ads, no sponsors, no bs. The downside is that the format is a bit hard to digest (heh, get it?), as the videos are quite long (2-3h), covering many topics in depth, sometimes relapsing into rants and namecalling. But this comes with their ""grassroots"" approach (they featured u/nopara73, Wasabi wallet creator, many times, as well as other privacy oriented topics), and I have learned a lot from these guys and girls over time, and [Janine](URL deserves a special shout out for her journalistic ethics and vigour, continuing to call out many faulty practices in her work field. [Twitter](URL [YouTube channel](URL Tales From The Crypt - ""what's up you freaks, it's your boy Marty Bent!"". I like the relaxed, fun, but inquisitive style of the host, having beers/whisky with his guests, making them feel comfortable while grilling them with good questions. The selection of guests is great, too (Matt Corallo, Nic Carter, Hasufly, Jack Mallers, Pierre Rochard etc etc)! The host also has a ""Weekly Recap"" series as part of the podcast, as well as a daily (!) [newsletter](URL with recap of the daily stuff from the bitcoin space. [Twitter](URL [Libsyn](URL [Anchor.fm](URL [iTunes](URL WhatBitcoinDid - Peter (the host) attracted the wrath of bitcoiners by interviewing Craig ""Faketoshi"" Wright earlier this year without being able to challenge him enough on the technical side. But he seems to be driven by genuine curiosity, desire to learn and an open mind, which became evident with the progression of his podcast, the guest selection and the kind of discussions that have been had on his show. I like his approach to actually travel to his guests to interview them, so thumbs up for the effort. It was fun to observe him starting from a point of ""zero knowledge"" and advance to a full-blown bitcoin maximalist (well, almost!) by gaining understanding of how bitcoin works. One of my favourite episodes are the one with [Tuur Demeester](URL and [Nic Carter](URL Guests like Adam Back, Giacomo Zucco, but also non-bitcoin guests like Hester Pierce (SEC commissioner), Grin's/Mimblewible dev Michael Gordner etc. [Twitter](URL [Website](URL Noded - Bitcoin maximalism to the.. maximum. It might surprise you though that the views are actually quite balanced and not at all without critical, adversarial thoughts on bitcoin. The CVE-201817144 bug (inflation bug in the Bitcoin Core software) got extensive, critical coverage (a whole episode w/ John Newbery as a guest) and the views and questions of the hosts are much more nuanced and critical than the term ""maximalist"" might suggest. Guest list is comprised of devs like Rusty Russel, Christian Decker, Matt Corallo and ""hardcore"" bitcoiners like Murad Mahmudov. People with knowledge, low time preference, skin in the game and deeply rooted in the bitcoin space. [Twitter](URL [Website](URL [Soundcloud](URL Stephan Livera Podcast - another ""grassroots"" podcast, mainly focused on people from the developer and building space. Incredible work ethic of Stephan, suddenly coming out of nowhere and then bringing out a podcast almost every day, although it seems to have slowed down a lot recently. Guests like Justin Moon (creator of the ""BUIDL bootcamp""), Rene Pickhardt (Lightning dev/builder/educator), Samourai wallet dev etc. [Twitter](URL [Website](URL Tone Vays - probably no description necessary. Tone has been in the space for many years now, not afraid to call a bear market when everyone is a bull (and vice versa). Impressive dedication to shill his ref links in the beginning of each video, but we allow it for all the dedication to his youtube channel over the years. Not a podcast to go for technical information on bitcoin, but if you're into readings of those candles, those magic nines and things like that, it's a good podcast with some entertainment value and a good track record of staying scam-free. On that note, also check out Tone's [CryptoScam](URL series, where he analyzes various altcoins with guests like Peter Todd, StopAndDecrypt, Paul Storzc etc. [Twitter](URL [YouTube](URL Cryptoconomy- a guy with a pleasant voice reads out (and comments on) some of the most important articles in the bitcoin space (by Nick Szabo, f.ex). If you don't like reading long articles, this might be the podcast for you. [Twitter](URL [Website](URL "

Anyway it's been a while since I've checked up on them and after popping into Discord (essentially my social portfolio of altcoins) the panic made me realize something that everyone else probably already knew for days: The CVE-2018-17144 bug that was quickly fixed was also in most Bitcoin fork altcoins out there. Some teams like Ravencoin are updated, but PidgeonCoin (an obvious fork off of the aforementioned Bitcoin fork) have already been exploited. Go take a look at PGN on Coinmarketcap to see what an unrecoverable smashing of supply out of thin air looks like, and be glad that the BTC devs really take their (volunteer) jobs seriously. It's one thing to read about but another to see on the charts (yeah... I have close to 100,000 PGN that are now even more worthless...) My point in all of this rambling is: We all know that there were a lot of cash-grab-no-dev-support forks out there, but this exploit just expedited what could have been years worth of slow bleed as the poorly supported coins are exposed. I am sure PGN won't be the last, and I think it's interesting that what could have been a catastrophic bug for BTC may have actually helped solidify it's dominance."

It was so close to happening, we might as well consider it to have happened. What are the plans for if millions of BTC is stolen due to a bug? Would they roll back the blockchain, therefore invalidating every transaction that happened within the timeframe the stolen funds were moved? It seems to me like the original owners/hodlers should be the ones who are safe, and those who bought the stolen BTC should be the ones without a paddle, but is this decided upon? I'm asking because I wonder if I should hold products for an hour or so after payment is confirmed. Maybe less? Big news like that should travel fast. There may be interest in an Oracle people can trust to tell them if a BTC emergency like this has happened. This way we could design systems to hold the product automatically upon the Oracle's say so."

Segwit2x is all about hard forking to preserve Asicboost. You got businesses like Bitmain, Bitpay, DCG etc all benefiting from further delays. Many other businesses like Shapeshift are gaining off the rise of Alts, which is almost certainly due to the market hedgeing against continues Bitcoin scaling delays... so between most of the NYA signors they mostly have an interest in stalling Segwit..

I share one of many crashes that is caused by multi-threaded issues when using pointers to CNode objects. 4.

CVE-2010-5139 (CVE meaning common vulnerability and exposures) was frighteningly simple and exploited to the point of farce by an unknown attacker. In technical language, the bug is known as a number overflow error.So instead of the system counting up 98, 99, 100, 101, for example, it broke at 99 and went to zero (or -100) instead of 100. In laymans terms, someone found a way to flood the code and create a ridiculously large amount of bitcoin in the process. 5. 11/12 March 2013 - Chain Fork Information What happened: A bitcoin miner running version 0.8.0 created a large block (at height 225,430) that is incompatible with earlier versions of Bitcoin. The result was a block chain fork, with miners, merchants and users running the new version of bitcoin accepting, and building on, that block, and miners, merchants and users running older versions of bitcoin rejecting it and creating their own block chain. there is more examples. and i a, not trying to bash anyone here, hust trying to point out that even core has had its fair share of fuckups.

16,CVE-,Bitcoin,"In The Event BU Forks Off, Are There Any Core Vulnerabilities That Could Be Attacked?",2,60imkp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/60imkp/in_the_event_bu_forks_off_are_there_any_core/,2017-03-21 06:27:14,"I'm not sure if this is an appropriate place to ask this, but I figured I'd give it a shot. This is a bit of a different sort-of technical question, but one that I think needs to be asked. If Unlimited were to fork, -and- miners were to attack the Core chain are there any vulnerabilities that could be exploited to disrupt the Core chain? For example: The known bug CVE-2013-2292, which is a never-used &amp; not-so-useful DoS attack vector that, if exploited, could create a transaction that takes ~3 minutes to verify; I've long doubted that this could or would be used to cause any real disruption to users, however if it were exploited *during* a hard-fork I'm not so sure. It seems to me that malicious miners could spam the chain with these transactions (that BU miners are prepared to handle already) and exacerbate the already slow block propagation times (from losing hash power) on the Core chain quite a lot. This could reduce the length of the Core chain even more, causing BU to sprint ahead faster. I'm a software developer, but the core devs are light years ahead of me as far as skill is concerned; so, I'm just hoping to get some feedback from those smarter than me."
17,CVE-,Bitcoin,"On why 0.10's release notes say ""we have reason to believe that libsecp256k1 is better tested and more thoroughly reviewed than the implementation in OpenSSL""",523,2rrxq7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2rrxq7/on_why_010s_release_notes_say_we_have_reason_to/,2015-01-09 06:54:50,"Today OpenSSL [de-embargoed CVE-2014-3570](URL ""Bignum squaring may produce incorrect results"". That particular security advisory is not a concern for Bitcoin users, but it allows me to explain some of the context behind a slightly cryptic statement I made in [the release notes](URL for the upcoing Bitcoin Core 0.10: ""we have reason to believe that libsecp256k1 is better tested and more thoroughly reviewed than the implementation in OpenSSL"" Part of that ""reason to believe"" was our discovery of this OpenSSL flaw. In Bitcoin Core 0.10 we are migrating transaction signing, and only signing for now, to a cryptographic library we're currently developing-- [libsecp256k1](URL which is intended to provide a high-speed, sidechannel avoiding, and high-assurance implementation of the underlying public-key cryptography used in Bitcoin. Doing this allows us to deliver safer and more reliable software that better fits Bitcoin's specific needs. The library is mostly the work of Bitcoin Core super-contributor Pieter Wuille (sipa), though many other people are working on it too-- software created alone tends to be inherently unreviewed. This library is part of what Pieter and I are working on at Blockstream. During the development of libsecp256k1 we've been building a rather extensive test suite and employing a number of strategies to increase the assurance level of the software. Part of our testing verified the agreement of our internal functions with other implementations such as the ones in OpenSSL on random and specially-constructed random inputs. While doing this our tests turned up a case where OpenSSL's implementation of number squaring gave a wrong result. I've written a bit more about the technical details in [a post]( URL in /r/ programming. This error in OpenSSL could result in a number of cryptographic operations (for many different kinds of cryptosystems) yielding wrong results but due to good fortune the issue is not a concern for Bitcoin implementations. The incorrectly squared numbers would be expected to be found randomly with probability around one in 2^128, and so when one of the reference implementations of ed25519 had a very similar mistake [some described it](URL as ""a bug that can only be found by auditing, not by randomized tests"". But when we found this weren't auditing OpenSSL (the issue was burred deep in optimized code). Our tests used specially formed random numbers that were intended to explore a class of rare corner cases, a technique I'd previously used in the development of the Opus audio codec. Since our 'random' testing in libsecp256k1 was good enough to find one-in-a-{number too big to name} chance bugs which could ""only be found by auditing"" I'm a least a little bit proud of the work we've been doing there. (Obviously, we also use many other approaches than random testing on our own code.). I generally don't consider my own software adequately enough tested until its tests have turned up a bug in a compiler/toolchain. So far I've not encountered a compiler bug for libsecp256k1-- GCC and clang have been getting much better the last few years-- beyond some cases where the compiler produced brain-dead slow but correct output, so I may have to settle for discovering that a ubiquitous system library couldn't square correctly. I consider this a fun example of how the Bitcoin ecosystem can contribute to driving forward the state of the art in the security of cryptographic tools, and how our needs justify higher level of assurance than has been found in common software in the past. This example isn't the only reason I have to believe that this new code is better tested and reviewed, but it's a very concrete example."
