Honestly I don't know why I'm writing this. Maybe to get out how I've been feeling lately, or maybe because im just tired of that alone feeling. This zombie apocalypse is pretty crazy and brings out alot of emotions with everyone it seems. So a bit about me I guess. I am currently working full time and doing school full time for a degree in Cyber Security. In my free time I enjoy playing any blizzard game, magic the gathering, Animal Crossing/Pokemon on switch, or whatever flavor of the month game on PC and PS4. I have also been known to dabble in League of Legends and Smite. (Totally willing to play FFXIV again if I have someone to play with). Music is my life!! I recently started collecting vinyls and going to shows is something I really enjoy doing as well I also have 2 rescue puppers Loki and Zeus, they are super amazing and I'm a big animal person!! Currently looking for someone who can partake in the nerdiness or atleast be cool with it! Age isn't too much of an issue I guess. And would like someone who also shares some goals as me IE college, full time work, place of their own, etc. If this peaked your interest at all feel free to shoot me a chat or message. Thanks for taking the time to read this :)"

So. Here's where this 24 year old, european, male exhibit of the species is coming from. Please, don't touch the glass. I'm kind of an introvert with fairly regular (I think?) spurts of extroversion (as one is). That's just a roundabout, disclaimer-y way of saying that outside those spurts, there's a high chance you'd be playing social expectations whack-a-mole with me. And not the fun kind. Extreme examples aside, I do have a warm disposition towards clicking with peeps and going with the cyber-flow, having profound conversations about nothing at all or trying to make light about everything. Starting off from something like the slippery properties of banana peels, going through the war on drugs, skipping along the fondest memories of childhood to the tunes of 'Sigur Ros', and probably ending up somewhere in the general vicinity of the expanse of the universe or something, completely and utterly drained. And you'd then think to yourself: ""Yeah, I just spent the last five hours passionately speechifying my interest in folks who knit sweaters for oil-spill affected penguins with a complete stranger/digital friend, but you know what? It wasn't half bad! Even though my fingers are sore from all the texting. And you know what else? If I'm feeling cray-cray one of these days, I might just hop into a pair of sweatpants (because just sitting in my underwear, like the potato I usually am, would just be vaguely weird) and do that shit AGAIN! Yeah, that's right! I may not be Steve Irwin (who even is, anyway!), but I'm adventurous!"" Listen: I don't have anything against personal life stuff either, just as long as there's respectful boundaries established. Pretty sure being a spying smart fridge, knowing you got exactly two and a half tomatoes left somewhere in there and no money to make that three full tomatoes won't do anyone much good. ... Moving on from that sadness sundae, if I were to profile my inside-oriented entertainment persona...like every other digitally developed internet dweller, I guess I'm into: - movies (I last watched 'Uncut Gems' and next up on the list is 'Knives Out') - TV shows (Just finished 'The Good Place' and 'The New Pope' and looking to finish off 'Six Feet Under') - music (Pretty much open to everything, though I never really grew out of that specific Linkin Park - Sum 41 - SR-71 - Simple Plan 2000s era, to be honest. Lately, I've been listening to 'Nightwish') - a little anime (looking to get into 'Vinland Saga') - some comics (finished 'Y: The Last Man' and getting into 'Scalped') - also, a little writing and listening to podcasts (psychology, philosophy, mystery, and sometimes history) - also-also, losing precious sleep-time down internet rabbit holes I'm probably never going to think about again, after that one time (unless trying to impress someone with sporadically encyclopedic knowledge of random shit, of course) ... Now, I know what everyone's here for: the personal, juicy deets! Consequently... Who am I into, lately, anyway? Keanu Reeves. Obviously. My mom (ew, not like THAT). Kevin Richardson (the lion guy). Camille Paglia. Shakira (what're you gonna do?). Daryl fucking Davis. And this girl in my building who I've never talked to, verbally, but held, like, 15 to 30 second conversations exclusively through facial expressions (snickers or giggles don't count). Actually, come to think about it...her boyfriend's pretty cute, too. Let's see, what else? Gosh, I don't know! I guess...random, non-descript girls in amateur porn? Jeez, lay off, people! What do I love, right now? Sleep, after finally managing to go on a healthy, steady sleep-schedule. Also, evening walks while listening to various true-crime cases. Something about valiantly keeping your best poker face together and politely smiling to the cashier, while there's horrible shit just pouring into your ears. What do I hate, right now? Honestly? Way too much effort and energy required, to hate something specifically. Except getting old and hearing your joints popping. But generally? That I can do. Actually, I'm pretty sure everyone does, to an extent. You know, humanity's greatest rival; ourselves. Yes, I know: hardy-har-har. Go ahead. Get it out of your system. As I was saying...the human condition (of which I'm accutely aware I'm a part of), and all the symptoms that come with it: mostly, just the clinical apathy enabled by the constant wallow in the helplessnes of the individual scaled up to the rest of the world's problems. What's that turn of phrase: eyes wide shut, right? Yeah... Also, lazily watching 'Friends' re-runs I've watched before, because sometimes, my laptop is simply too far away. ... What am I about, in a Twitter comment or less (or a little more)? Don't really know, since I don't do social media. (glancing suspiciously at Reddit) I could make a serious, straight-faced case about the world's most important cultural site: memes. And how they're effectively contemporary cave paintings. All in front of a packed theatre. Then, go home and ugly cry like I've never ugly cried before, watching animal documentaries and their portrayal of the ying-yang attitude of Mama Nature and the neutrally-cruel-but-comforting-at-the-same-time caress of Father Time's voice (who is totally NOT David Attenborough). ... Favorite quote: ""Knowledge is knowing Frankenstein's not the monster and wisdom is knowing Frankenstein is the monster."" - Wayne Gretzky Least favorite quote: (How are you?) ""I'm good, thanks."" - humanity ... TL;DR? Uh...shooting the virtual shit, I guess."

I think there are 2 options 1) Put a lot of stuff people like to read and get some conv started and ended by the end of the same day with a lot of disappointment . 2) Put the raw truth maybe don't get that many DM but those you get will be worth it. I am going with #2, i like the truth the raw one, so with that being said here it is: 37 yo old guy from Costa Rica who works in Cyber Security (red team), it means i get paid to find vulnerabilities in company networks. Do i use my knowledge for bad purposes, umm i hack accounts sometimes just to watch a show lets say hulu or so, and sometimes if i get a lot of them i give them away (check my post history). I am not the religious type, that's OK if you are, i don' judge. I am moving to a healthy live style, I am doing yoga , eating better ( still like meat) that's a nice journey which have been rewarding. I am also a nudist, yes you can ask questions about that or anything as well. What I like ? Travel, if you like it too and have stories to share or want to hear a few I am your guy. Cooking, I can prepare some Thai food , french macaroons, sushi, Mexican chilaquiles with the sauce and everything else from scratch, also Russian, Greek, Peruvian food you name it i would probably have a recipe lying around. I used to play video games more some time ago, still i play from time to time and I am willing to give it a try to some interesting one as well. I like science and philosophy, which is a sweet and sour mix but still one i find enjoyable. &amp;#x200B; **Who I would like to meet?** Someone who has this dark humor, who will have those memes that maybe most people will find too dark for their own taste. Someone who likes to wonder about the world around us, who doesn't just believes everything just because, i like people who question the status quo and make their own criteria. Someone who appreciates the differences, from a cultural point of view to general life expectations and goals and dreams, I believe expecting to find someone who is 100% in sync is quite as much as improbable as the sync itself. Someone with an open mind, who is ready to try new things, live the life and create moments which turn into memories. &amp;#x200B; If you are reading here , you might be that person, send me a PM we will figure it out."

I love that about you. Hello fellow weirdos, nerds, unicorns, and magicians! I am looking for my partner in crime to enjoy what the world has to offer together. Maybe fate was destined and you are intrigued and want to get to know me. I am laid back, easy going, and enjoy to live in the moment. A label I like to put on myself is ""introverted extrovert"". I have strong emotions and wear my heart on my sleeve. My head is a walking idea generator. I'm constantly buzzing with crazy ideas, daydreams, visions and concepts so much that I get easily distracted. I am happily optimistic and keep blabbering about how I experience mundane stuff. I love listening to you rambling about whatever, as long as you are enthusiasticly talking. I consider myself very open minded. I like to discuss politics, sciences, philosophy, religion, psychology and interpersonal relationships. I don't really like to put humans into boxes, especially msyelf. No matter what box you try to put me in, I'll claw my way out. I value authenticity above all else. I love music of all different kinds, from death metal to psytrance, from hip hop to 80ies. I love progressive and psychedelic rock the most. I love concersts and festivals. Some bands that I like: Tool,R.H.C.P., Gorillaz, and my farourite King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. I love psychedelic art, op art, and everything with ""heavy"" imagery. In my free time I like to write as a hobby - poems,short stories, and recently philosophical texts. I love horror, fantasy and scifi. I am a huge nerd. That obscure cyber punk novel? I read it. That avant garde horror movie? seen it. David Lynch, Tarantino, and Nolan are my favourites. I love cartoons and anime as well. Adventure time, Bojack Horseman, Rick and Morty. Steins;gate, FMA Brotherhood, Jojo's bizarre adventure and One Piece. I love PC gaming. At least once or twice a week I play Counter Strike, DotA, or chess with my online friends. I enjoy single player games as well. Everytime I get sucked into a world and can't do anything in my free time other than to completely obsess over that game. Witcher, Mass Effect, Red Dead Redemption 2, Bio Shock and all that good stuff. Currently playing Sekiro while waiting for Cyberpunk. However I don't game as much as I used to! I love meeting with friends. I meetup with most of them at a bar at least twice a month. I enjoy meeting up for board games, a few drinks, listening to music and talk shit. I am a hopeless romantic. The throw everything away for the right person kind of hopeless. My crushes are few and far between, but when I fall for someone, my feelings are overwhelming and last wayyyy to long to be healthy. I tend to overthink a lot. If I have ONE nice conversation with you, you can be sure I already imagined us having kids and growing old together. My live tends to get chaotic, and I love it. Growing up is for everyone. Being an adult is for suckers. What I like in women \-emotional needy, even clingy. \-show me you like me. Seriously, stalk me. \-be intelligent and knowledgeable \-be engaging and passionate \-bonus if you are introverted/depressed .... \-looks are entirely optional \-&gt; For the record tho: I like chubby girls with long hair and bright unnatural colors Red Flags: \-have as many as you like \-I like to collect too Still reading?

Honestly I saw a video of my friend (who is an independent in terms of politics) out in a protest helping out people on both sides who were being sprayed with pepper and shit be pushed down by ANTIFA people and throw something at and punched in the face by one of them who had a No Hate sign. He wasnt fighting back. He wasnt even screaming. He was just walking peacefully amongst the chaos trying to assist those who have been hurt. It really made me realize that both extreme sides are just as bad and I dont want to be like, hey you voted for trump? Fuck you! Or Oh you liked Barack as President? You are antiabortion? Fuck you! Nah Im going to accept you. Even if we have differing positions, that doesnt mean much to me.

Right now listening to Daughters Landfill just depressed and not sure what to make of my life. Im huge on advocating for privacy and Cyber Security. Got shit on someone earlier today cause I apparently stated the obvious about Snapchat locations. I simply said it as a REMINDER cause not everyone, like he so boldly claimed, is aware. My friend sure wasnt. My niece (whos 16) surely wasnt. And you never know these days. But my friend, a computer programmer, told me.. Honestly though, the availability of information doesn't negate the need for security and in fact, I agree. It means we need it more than ever. Aside from that, I enjoy listening to Cyber Security and True Crime podcasts. Recently been struggling with anxiety/paranoia, mood swings and anger issues (clearly). I guess Im just a mess. Feel free to message me if youre brave enough."

My life has had a lot of change and craziness the past few years and I've kind of become a bit of a recluse as far as being social goes. I am a typical nerd, I love science/scifi things, animals, gaming ( go figure?), reading books.... My not so nerdy hobbies include going to the beach and walking along the boardwalk, going to the gym to get in better shape, spending time with friends doing whatever comes to mind at the time, spending time with my furbaby Benji ( check my profile for pictures ). I'd love to meet some one who can handle my sarcasm, and give it back even more, some one who doesn't take life serious 100% of the time, but knows when to. I'm not just looking for some one to date, but some one who I can have as a best friend first, and if it doesn't develop into something more that's okay too."
13,cyber crime,r4r,21[F4R] USA - Morbid &amp; Nerdy Peep Looking For Fellow Peeps.,1,apwjq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/apwjq6/21f4r_usa_morbid_nerdy_peep_looking_for_fellow/,2019-02-13 05:34:43,"Aha, I almost posted it as ""Morbid &amp; NEEDY Peep"" Yikes. Going to give a full disclaimer: I am looking for companionship. A best friend, first and foremost, however. If it leads anywhere to romance, great. If not, that's fine too. I do work nights, however, and after college I plan on moving out of State. Thus, I'm open to anyone anywhere from ages 20-29. I am bisexual. If all you're looking for is friendship, message me. I will gladly be the friend you need. Anyway, here's a list of things people close to me have said about me: - Poetic - Dark - Intense as all hell - Has ridiculous amount of attention to detail - Incredibly vivid imagination - Funny - A virgin who can't drive (I really ***am*** a virgin who can't drive). - Weird - Random - Morbid - Socially Awkward - Sassy - Good writer - Quiet as all hell, but a super freak once that wears off. - Melachonic - Able to peel people's layers off as if they were an onion I don't like to see anyone as all good or all bad because I am sure that we all have our own set of flaws and we all have things we need to work on. For example, I was diagnosed borderline. After a break up, I took the time to work on myself with the resources I had. I no longer experience extreme mood swings, consistent suicidal thoughts, intense anger, or paranoia. I also no longer split on people (idealize/devalue them). All this took me a month to get under wraps. I truly believe we all have it in us to enjoy the sunset after the darkest of times. A few of my interests are: - Forensics &amp; True Crime / This is a huge passion of mine. From the time I was a little girl, all I wanted was to be a forensic scientist. This is main reason why I chose cyber-security. I am skeptical of technology and I'm aware of the issues with it. I want to do the best to prevent harm to others and keep them protected online. I came across some dark content that messed with my psyche so bad, it made me question who I am. I don't want that to be the case for others. - Kids, doggos, cats / I like em all. I'm an aunt to five nieces, one nephew. Not all are blood related. I love doggos and I have one cat. - Film / Main reason I've made so much progress and learned so damn much is thanks to FILM. my ex who I met on needafriend is the reason for my passion in film. I hope to learn to create my own content one day soon. - Music / I prefer classic rock, hard rock, indie, dream pop. I also like rap music. Sometimes I'll listen to french or Spanish music (Latina obsessed with French culture). I like it all. Above all, I'm definitely a rocker chick. - Psychology &amp; Medicine / Possibly my strongest suits. I'm also well versed in nutrition. - Horror / Someone I had met on here got me back into horror. I'd watch it all the time as a kid. It's what peaked my morbid curiosity. Other random facts - I like Star Wars &amp; DC Universe (sorry). - Obsessed with witches. Dressed up as one every Halloween. - I didn't know how to put my hair up in a pony tail until I was 16. Yep. - I suck when it comes to make up. So I never wear it. - Despite living in the constant heat, I love and tolerate cold weather better. - I love to read Uh yeah this is way TOOOO long so if you read it, congratulations. Feel free to message me anything pertaining to yourself. Please do apply some effort. Thanks. "

Im a female somewhat by the west coast (will give exact location if we hit it off). I currently work at the airport and I love it. Its busy and stressful at times but its a great job. It keeps me close to my dream of one day traveling. I work the international section so I see tons of people from all over the world. Yesterday, I landed a Canadian coin and I couldnt be happier to be honest. I was teaching myself basic French and Swedish. Ultimately, I love writing. I enjoy keeping a journal and been compared to Sylvia Plath. However, for as INFP as I am, I decided my ultimate dream is to pursue a career in digital forensics. So I am majoring in computer science with a focus in cyber security! Job security matters a lot to me. I dont want to be ignorant of the technology we utilize constantly, and after being redirected to a malicious site that held awful things, I decided I want to help do something about it. I always wanted to be a forensic scientist of some sort anyway. Plus, I enjoy challenging and analytical work. Im a cinephile and a total music lover. Id be willing to attach Spotify playlist or my letterboxd profile so you can see what type of films and songs I enjoy. Actually, A LOT of the mental progress Ive made is due to movies! I was once diagnosed with BPD. Now I just have traits! Which means I am close to remission. :) I made a lot of progress and the truth about getting better is you gotta want it enough to say enough is enough! The number of times Ive had friends come to me for help and later blow off my advice. A never-ending cycle, if only they knew it all starts with them. There is no quick cure. Im attempting to get fit as I enter boxing again. I eventually want to learn to play guitar. I love true crime and theres some cases which just have never left my mind. I also tend to have vivid dreams of murders taking place. Im never in the dream, Im merely the observer. Im into sitcoms like the office, scrubs, community, parks and rec. I was a huge tv buff and I love SOA. It is my top #1. Sure its not a perfectly made show but wow did it do me wonders. I have a dark sense of humor, like to be playful type of mean. Sometimes I get sad or attached too quickly. I get weird or too random. Honestly its cause I try hard to impress others but Im just going my own way. I enjoy psychology, medicine, sad/tragic/morbid/horror type of things. Im one huge fucking burrito filled with surprises. Fun fact: never cared to see an episode of sponge-bob. Not looking to be ghosted. I dont care if youve got a gf or a crush. Whatever. Just be honest with me and Ill be honest with you. Close to age would be fine, but it is what it is. I have Kik, iMessage, or discord "

I'm looking for like-minded people, I'll describe myself and some of my interests and if you find yourself having similar qualities or are interesting in learning more, send me a message: - Most importantly I love computers. I dream of having 12 monitor setups running minimalist Gentoo. I spend my weekends going to tech meetups. I program bots and web-scrapers for fun. I enjoy learning about cyber privacy, infosec, hardware (and the firmware it uses), software, mechanical keyboards, and so on endlessly. - I'm a gamer. Preferably PC gaming is my favorite, but I've enjoyed a lot of platforms in the past. I enjoy a wide range of stuff but most commonly FPS and (MMO)RPGs. - I'm competitive. I strive to learn more, improve myself, and be the best, whatever that is. When I was super-into MMORPGs I made a guild of over 1,000 members. When I was investing a ton of time into Overwatch I was the best in the world for my hero while making a full-time living playing the game. I like setting goals, to do lists, and dreaming big. I'd love a friend who liked to push each other to strive to do awesome things together. - That being said, I'm not all serious-business. I love wasting days in a row binge-watching the extended director additions of a movie series with a friend. I like going out to somewhere new for the first time or going on an exotic trip. I can lose at Monopoly and not flip the board and/or threaten to set the world on fire. - I love to read and watch stuff in general. My favorite genres are science-fiction, fantasy, apocalyptic/dystopian, horror, educational, crime, and all kinds of punk stuff, especially cyberpunk. I also enjoy anime/manga/comics/graphic novels. - I'm edgy as fuck. I don't mean I sit in the corner and scowl ""omg u just dont get me mom its not a phase wtf"". I just love spooky shit. My wardrobe is basically all black. My favorite music genres are punk/emo/metal (although I can enjoy most anything besides most rap/country). I love the macabre, Halloween, dark humor, and stories of things that go bump in the night. - I enjoy being a night-owl and staying up for long stretches. - Decent spelling and grammar is really pleasant. - I like people who are intelligent, polite, and respectful. I get there are stigmas around competitiveness, edginess, and so forth. I don't want friends who are sore winners or losers. I don't want to be around people who are sexist, racist, homophobic, or have any kind of large-scaled blind-hatred for a label. Giving compliments, respecting boundaries, and not being an asshat in general is cool. Wow, that went a bit long, haha, sorry! Anyway, let me know if you're interested."

29,cyber crime,r4r,25 [M4R] Michigan/Anywhere - Nerdlord looking for friends (or more?) from any corner of the planet,2,71cyi2,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/71cyi2/25_m4r_michigananywhere_nerdlord_looking_for/,2017-09-21 04:08:51,"First off, I'm a pre-op, pre-hormones trans man (FTM), if you can't accept and respect that, beat it, nerd! Also, I ramble, sorry in advance! * Forever a goth and anime/cartoons nerd. Definitely love my live action TV too though. I don't judge people for being too childish/slutty/neckbeardy/whatever unless they're into deep into red flag territory. Bigots will always be judged, deal with it. * Unfortunately 5 feet tall. :''''( If you're short too, we could take turns lifting each other on our shoulders so we can finally feel like the tall people we were meant to be. Eat shit, puberty! * I'm sardonic AF and use humor to cope with my health problems. Better than somebody moping around all the time, right? My main issues are anxiety, depression, insomnia, and fibromyalgia/chronic pain, plus a speech impediment. That won't stop me from poking fun at myself and others, although *sometimes* I get in those ""I'm going to listen to Linkin Park and lament about my sadsack life in my LiveJournal!"" moods. But usually I might just joke that I don't need to know the touch of a woman when I can enjoy the sweet embrace of death instead. * I'm dealing with some problems with motivation right now but I currently work part-time at the family business and I'm working on completing my living dex (AKA Pokemon shit) when I feel like it. Trade with me! I bought some older games like Black, Soul Silver, etc. just so I can catch a bunch of Pogeys to trade. * I do like vidya besides Pokemon but it's all that I've been interested in playing lately. For some games, I'd rather watch Let's Plays. * I really like foreign languages, despite being a huge introvert. Ironic, no? I'm focusing on Spanish right now and sort of Filipino/Tagalog when I remember, but I also like (in order of preference) Japanese, Arabic, Korean, Swahili, Hindi/Urdu (can't decide!), Vietnamese, Mandarin... Sort of Thai, Turkish, and Zulu too. Realistically, I don't see myself becoming fluent in all 500 of those languages but learning how to read/write and knowing basic phrases in most of them would be sweet. * I'm interested in traveling internationally maybe once a year, starting in the next 12 months after I save up some money and figure out where I wanna go first. If I could met somebody outside of the US, either platonically or romantically, I'd love to stay at their place, maybe bring them some American junk they want, sight-see a bit, buy junk from their country, that kind of thing. Same thing US-wise but Michigan unfortunately has very few things of value. * I own a [doggo!](URL She's *very* spoiled, trust me. I consider myself a cat person with a cat-like dog, but unfortunately I developed a mild cat allergy after having cats as a kid. It's minor, but too inconvenient to own a cat because I love snuggling cute critters too much to not my face against kitties on the regular. * Don't smoke (lung problems), and don't drink (hate the taste), that means I'm not interested in bonding over a nice cold beer, and I can't stand the smell/taste of cigarettes. 420 is okay, even if it *does* smell like skunk ass, but I can't smoke it. Other drugs are a hard no, I have addicts in my family and that's painful enough. **For m'lads and m'ladies:** * I'm pansexual, meaning that I don't care about whatever junk somebody has and I like somebody for their personality. I'm topping during hypothetical sex though. * I want an equal partnership with somebody I would consider one of my best friends. No ""one works, one takes care of the house"" shit. Both of us should want to improve our lives whether it's through working, learning, filling out our Pokedexes, whatever. * I don't like ""you complete me/I'm incomplete without you!""-type mushy stuff, it seems too needy. Both of us should be comfortable together and apart because everybody needs time to themselves/their friends. I don't mind if friend groups overlap but I'm very comfortable with both of us having our own friends. I'm open to chatting everyday but again, everybody needs time to themselves. * Looks-wise, I'm very into long hair (chin-length and longer) and no facial/body hair when it comes to guys. Bald/very short hair cuts on men should be a *crime!!!* I don't have any particular preferences for girls, other than I guess no facial/body hair too, although I'm less anal about it. * No kids, only pets! I'm completely uninterested in raising human children, you can ask me for my reasons but don't push the issue. * My only official ex is an abusive, cyber-stalking, cheating piece of shit, so I know how *not* to treat you because I'm nice! *obligatory fedora tip!* If you're into that, well... psycho-masochists need not apply. * Borders are really not an issue, although I'd much prefer if you spoke one of the languages mentioned above. I've watched 90 Day Fiance multiple times, I'm practically an expert on immigration law! /lots of s * If you like Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and/or 90 Day Fiance, that would be a *huge* bonus. **Et cetera:** **A couple of profiles so you can gauge my interests:** [MyAnimeList](URL (Anime), [Last.FM](URL (Music), [Trakt.TV](URL (Movies/TV shows), currently on an anime hiatus and also a non-anime TV binge though. **Favorite subs:** /r/90DayFiance, /r/LanguageLearning, /r/UnresolvedMysteries **I've got Discord for chatting!** Skype is unfortunately too laggy for me. Facebook and Reddit PMs are acceptable. I don't give out phone numbers unless I know and trust somebody well enough. Uh... ask about other messaging options? /shrugs?!"
