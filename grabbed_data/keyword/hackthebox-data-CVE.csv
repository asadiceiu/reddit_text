When I initially enumerated the box, nmap said that it was vulnerable to Shellshock when I ran the http-shellshock NSE script: # Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Mon Aug 10 22:53:13 2020 as: nmap -A --script http-shellshock --script-args uri=/test -p 80 -oN scans/nmap --append-output 10.10.10.6 Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.6 Host is up (0.45s latency).

2,CVE,hackthebox,"Thank you /r/Hackthebox. Also, I have a question.",1,gvvfch,https://www.reddit.com/r/hackthebox/comments/gvvfch/thank_you_rhackthebox_also_i_have_a_question/,2020-06-04 00:56:11,"First the question so that you don't have to read the whole post if you don't want to. **What do you want to see from a channel on security and hacking?** I appreciate the few people that reached out here and on youtube to give me feedback for the sub 20 minute walkthroughs I'm doing. I'm trying to maximize knowledge and strategies while minimizing time and I see that there are a few things that I can be doing better. I'm hoping to get more content out on my channel over the next few weeks beyond just walkthrough. This would include basic tools, tactics, and strategies so that they can be referenced if need be. I've just released the second Walkthrough, this time for 'Active', a fun easy machine. You can find it here if you'd like to look: URL My plan is to start doing 2 videos a week as I move through, maybe decreasing down the line since I'll eventually start taking longer as I knock boxes off and still want to do the active machines. Although, I do also have an idea that I've begun working on for a shortform podcast, offering the stories behind major vulnerabilities and the impact they've had. I've already recorded on based on the Citrix Vulnerability, CVE-2019-19781 but want to have a backlog of a few episodes and make sure I've got my own format decided on before I try to push it. Again, thank you to those who have been kind enough to offer the feedback. I hope I can build this up into something that's not just a clone of another channel, but until I get some of those ideas into a more concrete position I think that's what it'll be."

I will try to describe what I did as best as I can without spoiling anything. So anyway, I'm really stuck on OpenAdmin. I ran nmap, found open ports and services running on those ports. One service with version X.X.29 looks promissing, I looked up CVE and searchsploit results for this and I think I found the right exploit to use. Am I on the right track? If yes, my problem now is that I have no clue how to run/use that exploit. I have experience with metasploit and compiling downloaded exploits. But I have no experience with this kind of exploits. I don't even know what to search/study to get this info. I suspect curl might be the way to go, but I have not been successful. Could you please point me to the right direction or help me with using this exploit? Thanks!"

I found a bunch of directory listings on the box, found local.xml, found the admin panel/magento connect panel. I've been searching around the directories/files as well as attempting to enumerate more (dirb + SecLists) to find more information. I also found an exploit that should work, but as I'm reading the CVE, it only works with admin dashboards (via admin panel) and not a user account you create on the shop. Is it safe to assume that I need to find admin creds to proceed forwards with the exploit? Otherwise, I guess I need to keep enumerating. &amp;#x200B; Thanks."

New here. Beep is my 2nd machine this far. I determined that performing CVE-2012-4869 AKA EDB-ID: 18650 on Elastix/FreePBX would be a good idea. I am trying to perform this explot and I think I am doing this wrong.. but another point is for me to accomplish this without metasploit.. here is what I am doing: Upon filling out the python variables and launching the script through terminal I do not receive a connection - I do have a ncat listener going on listening for the reverse shell on the correct port - I receive a IO socket error saying that the certificate failed. Am I going about this whole exploit correctly? Launching the script with the correct variables - the script then opens the URL that reaches out to my netcat listener nc commands used: &gt; nc -l - p 'port' Please feel free to refer me to any documentation or any information on what I am missing or I need to do. Appreciate the time. Links to the exploit code: URL
