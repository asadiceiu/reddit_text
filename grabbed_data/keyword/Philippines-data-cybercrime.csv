It should be under the scope of Civil Code and not on Penal Code. I know it's been a widely debated issue and medyo late na rin for a commentary pero here is my take on this. Yup, I believe that politics is involved here but set aside muna natin and focus more on the legal milieu. Sadly, it is my view that all the requisites of libel is present. I agree on all points on this part of the decision. But the unsettling portions of the decision is the issues on the prescription of cybeelibel and the issue on republication. The decision dangerously stated that cyberlibel's prescription should be 12 years as compare to the 1 year prescriptive period of ordinary libel. While it is true that the cybercrime prevention act provides no details as to the prescription of online, the court should've used the prescriptive period provided by our revised penal code. In the landmark case of Disini, also mentioned in this case, the stated that: &gt;Indeed, cyberlibel is actually not a new crime since Article 353, in relation to Article 355 of the penal code, already punishes it. In effect, Section 4(c)(4) above merely affirms that online defamation constitutes ""similar means"" for committing libel. In line with the reasoning of the Court(SC), the lower court should've applied the 1 year prescriptive period. On the issue of republication, absent of any jurisprudence or laws, the lower court finds this meritorius to counter the petitioners' claim that the offense already prescribed. This is arbitrary, whimsical and capricious. The lower court shoul've bear in mind the well-settled doctrine in criminal law that in dubio, pro reo (when in doubt, for the accused.) This doctrine should've also been applied on the prescriptive period of cyberlibel."

She faces charges of inciting to sedition. GENERAL SANTOS CITY, Philippines  A teacher and her son of legal age were arrested without warrants here on Friday night, March 27, over what local officials tagged as a ""provoking"" Facebook post, and face charges of inciting to sedition and disobedience to authority, respectively. As General Santos City was under enhanced community quarantine to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a Facebook user vented that people were going hungry and encouraged people to raid a local gym where food meant for them were supposedly stocked. A Facebook account using the name Yet Rodriguez Enosencio posted: ""Maraming mamamatay sa gutom if hindi tayo magtutulong-tulong na magreport sa Pangulo na inutil ang ating Mayor.... Panawagan sa walang makain, sugurin 'nyo na nang sabay-sabay ang Lagao Gym. Nakatambak doon ang pagkaing para sa inyo."" (Many people will die if we don't report to the President that our mayor is incompetent. I call on those who have nothing to eat to raid the Lagao Gym. The food packs meant for you are piled up there.) 'Continuing crime' Upon the complaint of the City Government's Legal Office, the Philippine National Police (PNP) Region 12 Cybercrime Unit hunted down the Facebook user and arrested the person behind it, Juliet Espinosa, a 55-year-old public school teacher. Cops arrested Espinosa even without a warrant, saying that because the post was still live on Facebook, it will count as a continuing crime. This follows an earlier ruling by the Department of Justice (DOJ) that upheld as valid the warrantless arrest of web administrator Rodel Jayme for helping upload the Bikoy ""Ang Totoong Narcolist"" videos. Like Jayme, Espinosa faces charges of violation of Article 142 of the Revised Penal Code or Inciting to Sedition. Dahil diyan, inaresto namin siya kasi this a continuing crime  patuloy siya na nangyayari  kasi during that time pumunta si Atty Clarin sa office namin, it was about 4 oclock in the afternoon, present pa 'yung post na 'to, hindi pa 'to deleted said Police Major Leo Dofelis, Assistant Chief of the regional cybercrime unit. (We arrested her because this is a continuing crime  it's still happening  because when Atty Clarin went to our office at about 4 pm this afternoon, the post is still there, it's not been deleted.) Dofelis was referring to Arman Clarin, General Santos City's Legal Officer. Inciting to sedition is defined as ""seditious words or speeches, write, publish, or circulate scurrilous libels against the Republic of the Philippines or any of the duly constituted authorities thereof, or which tend to disturb or obstruct any lawful officer in executing the functions of his office, or which tend to instigate others to cabal and meet together for unlawful purposes, or which suggest or incite people against the lawful authorities or to disturb the peace of the community, the safety and order of the Government, or who shall knowingly conceal such evil practices."" Son arrested too Espinosa's son, of legal age, was also arrested for trying to stop the cops from taking his mother. The son will face charges of violation of Article 151 or resistance or disobedience to a person of authority. ""Later on we might press an additional charge of obstruction of justice against him,"" Dofelis said in Filipino. The mother and son were in jail, and would undergo inquest proceedings on Monday, March 30. Courts and prosecutors' offices are physically closed nationwide, but judges and officers will go to work for an urgent matter like bail. Both inciting to sedition and disobedience to authority are bailable. Liability of those who shared ""Her case is also in relation to RA 10175 or the cybercrime law,"" Dofelis said in Filipino. Dofelis said they will study the criminal liability of those who shared Espinosa's post. The Supreme Court has already declared as unconstitutional the provision of the Cybercrime Prevention Act that punishes ""aiding and abetting"" in a case of cyber libel. The newly-passed Bayanihan To Heal As One Act, which gives special powers to President Rodrigo Duterte, penalizes ""individuals or groups creating, perpetuating, or spreading false information regarding the COVID-19 crisis on social media and other platforms."" ""Isang post mo lang na mali especially sa COVID-19 issue, baka maka-cause ng panic o baka ma-misinterpret ng iba at mag-encourage pa na gumawa nang hindi maganda,"" said Dofelis. (One wrong post you make especially on the COVID-10 issue may cause panic, or may be misinterpreted and may encourage others to break the law.) The DOJ had earlier said that warrantless arrest can be implemented against lockdown violators who will be caught in the act, no matter if they resist arrest or not.  Rappler.com"

9,cybercrime,Philippines,SERIOUS: Hitting the big 2-5 wall crisis,1,cffanw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/cffanw/serious_hitting_the_big_25_wall_crisis/,2019-07-20 10:08:57,"Just hit quarter life last year and I'm about to turn 26 in a few months. It dawned upon me that many of my peers are already meeting milestones in their life (marrying, having their own family, getting promotions in a big company, travelling to other countries and studying their master's degree) while I am not even close to what they have achieved. Although I want to believe that everyone has their own time to achieve these, it feels like a little BS to me as of this moment. It worries me that I might marry old someday and that a woman marries me just to milk cash out of me. Never had a girlfriend ever since and I know people around me are trying to contain their laughter when they find it out. Heck, I've never asked out a girl once in fear of being rejected or worse, being branded as a creep. Reading people is not my strongest suits (it's one of my worst tbh) and finding friends is already hard, let alone relationships. It's like people are already running at full speed while I am still learning to crawl. Right now, I am attempting to take myself out of comfort zone by taking a law degree. Who knows it might push myself out of the shell. I'm not only after the prestige of being called an attorney though. I was hoping if I could marry my interest between reading and information technology and having a law degree will make it possible for me. I wish someday that I could become one of the pioneers in cybercrime laws as I have realized that cybercrime law here in Philippines is only on its infancy. Moving on. As someone who grew up ostracized because of my developmental disability, I unconsciously internalized that I should fit in no matter what it takes unless I want to be left alone gain. I know it's unhealthy but right now my sense of worth is dependent on how people view me. As much as I would like to change viewpoint, it seems my brain is hardwired to think this way. I missed out a lot in my youth and now I'm paying for it. If only I not have been uptight with myself, I will not be agonizing myself now. I also feel some regret for listening to my parents when they have advised me to pursue my studies first and forgo romantic relationships. I know they are doing this for my own good but I ended up socially stunted to some extent. Also, I can sympathize with their reasoning as my birth is unplanned and they don't want me to suffer the same consequence that they have suffered when I was young. TBH, I think that I'm too late for the game. Thanks to this subreddit and apologies if I can't organize my thought. How I write is somewhat sabog as of this moment. Writing here is therapeutic and I can ask advise here that are too touchy for my friends and family. I will appreciate if you can offer any advises on how can I change the way I think and are there anyone here with same experiences as I am?"

The whole ordeal is too long to narrate. I guess what just upsets me the most is it's so difficult to get information about the scammer/hacker. I understand the importance of data privacy and all that but this makes it challenging to file a police report. Even the PNP Anti-Cybercrime agent I spoke with admits that most respondents of similar cases use Republic Act 10173 as an excuse and only a court order can overturn it. This issue doesn't seem new to that site as well. They reply with canned responses, as if it's a common scenario. The email thread just went on with the same ending every time - ""yes, we can see the fraudster's info on our screen, but we cannot give it away."" That makes it sound so easy to scam or hack accounts on that site because the perpetrators will be protected. Most victims will probably just let it go too.

ALL-AT-THE-SAME-TIME. I have never felt so helpless. The email and phone verification code is useless! I reported it immediately, and I provided every information, timestamps, and screenshot to the CoinsPH rep and pnp cybercrime email I found online.

Remember that it was Sotto who inserted libel at the last minute in the cybercrime law. He did so after claiming to be cyberbullied due to his alleged plagiarism. The prescription of 12 years (as they are claiming for Ressas case) is also pretty ridiculous. I think the 1-year prescription period in the original libel law was fair enough."

16,cybercrime,Philippines,Google Sets New SSL Certificate Recommendations for Websites,1,8vqgd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/8vqgd8/google_sets_new_ssl_certificate_recommendations/,2018-07-03 18:03:07,"*Processing img 6gp5aua3vo711...* # Google sets deadline for SSL Certificates! URL ## WHAT EXACTLY IS AN SSL CERTIFICATE? SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer and is the technology now used to create an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This allows all the data passed between the web server and the browser to remain private. Without getting overly technical, HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is how information gets transmitted and received across the internet and HTTPS is just the secure version of it. Its a little tricky than that, but its basically all you need to know. When a site has a secure SSL certificate (and is set up properly) youll see a little padlock up in the navigation bar, and the URL will have https:// at the start instead of just http:// without the s. URL SSL certificates help the web cut down on instances of cybercrime that are often performed through security loopholes in web browsers. If the connection between the surfers web browser and web server are not secure through an SSL connection, a moderately skilled hacker could seize information, such as credit card numbers, as it is being typed into a form on an unsecured website. ## Why are Google SSL Requirements Important? * Establishes Trust and Builds Brand Power * Provides Encryption of Sensitive Information * Provides Authentication URL Google does not necessarily admit that non-HTTPS encrypted sites are at a handicap in its infamous search algorithm. But it is relatively safe to assume that a security warning on a website could lead to drastic fallout. Google is not only the largest search directory in the world, but they also have the most used web browser online. In fact, Google Chrome is leaps and bounds more used than any other web browser, according to this months Stat Counter. Googles leading role in both search directory and browser use mean that they yield enormous power when it comes to changes such as flagging non-HTTPS sites. Google has confirmed a date of early July 2018 as the start date. They have also disclosed how they will alert web surfers of the non-HTTPS status, or not secure. Sites that remain on the HTTP non-secure protocol will be flagged with a warning in the URL bar of the surfers browser. The non-secure flag will be built into the release of Chrome 68, which will be ready for download in early July. Heres an example, as posted per Google, of difference in URL optics between HTTP and HTTPS encryption websites: *Processing img 7m1qmeobvo711...* The image above represents Googles current likely change. Google followed up this by stating that the webs transition to HTTPS, which is also identified as making the web safer, by disclosing numbers supporting HTTPS growth and scale. HTTPS encryption growth shows that most site owners are taking Googles warnings seriously. **Non HTTPS sites and Google SEO** **** For site owners who have lagged on adapting their site to HTTPS encryption, time is indeed running out. URL To do this, it needs three different types of keys known as the public, private, and the session keys which all talk to each other to establish that secure session we all want. Heres a quick summary: *Processing img l5f7ufffvo711...* ## How SSL Works? 1.Your new reader visits your secure https website and their browser asks that the server identify itself. 2. Your server sends a copy of its SSL Certificate which includes the servers public key. 3.Their browser then checks the certificate against a list of trusted ones and makes sure its valid and up to date, etc. 4.If the browser is happy with the certificate, it creates a one-time session key with the public key from above. 5 .Your server then decrypts the session key using its private key to allow the secure session to start. Once that session has begun, everything that is transmitted between the browser and the secure server is encrypted, meaning that it is generally safe from people who are trying to spy on or steal that data as it gets sent through forms, carts, and so on. ## SSL Cost  Free Certificates Available Does Google sell SSL certificates? No. The easiest place to buy one is with your hosting company. SSL certicates cost between $20 USD to $200USD / year depending on the level of security your site requires. OSOmnimedia is offering the Installation and Management of SSL certificates on your website at a much cheaper price. #### If youd like us to queue your website for this service, or want to find out more about how this transition can help you get higher ranking and preference on Google, please dont hesitate to contact us (082-287-4191 / [info@osomnimedia.com](mailto:info@osomnimedia.com)).

Baka malibel. - **Poe: It's funny because it seems that Silent No More is silent now.** - Egco: Public education, social media literacy kailangan para maharap ang problema sa #FakeNews . - Egco: Laws to penalize fake news need careful study | - Egco: madaling akusahan ang kahit sino na gumagawa ng #FakeNews kasi di pa malinaw kung ano talaga ito. - Egco: Until we define just what 'fake news' is, any of us here could be charged with spreading #FakeNews. - NBI details amount of cybercrime cases they have received through the years: In 2017, 1,515 cases were filed. - NBI Cybercrime Division: We have filed 99 cases involving cybercrime from January to September 2017 - Hontiveros: The gov't already has an idea of how to define '#fakenews' as we've lead the roundtable discussion on this. - **Uson: Biktima rin ako ng fake news. ABS-CBN said I was a custom commissioner, Madam Claudia showed a check BBM paid me daw, GMA NEWS said nagselfie daw ako sa loob ng grand mosque ng marawi.** And I was bashed for all of these. **Poe to Uson: At least nararamdaman mo ang nararamdaman ng isang nabibiktima** - Poe: We should believe in information when it's factual, we should learn from it. - Uson keeps on trying to direct the hearing to Dayao. - Poe: (Pro duterte bloggers) have faces.

Mocha: blogger po ako, not a journalist. Bam: please tell her to answer yes or no. Mocha: I refuse to answer. Bam: on the grounds of? Mocha: I have the right ata? I have the right to self discri... incrimination. Zubiri: I don't think we should embarrass our resource person** - Poe to Uson: Konting payo lang.

Would you seriously say that each one of you are politically neutral? - Nieto: When an opinion gains traction, it means many Filipinos agree. Instead of blaming me for what I say, maybe you should start to listen - Poe: It's not the case that numbers will actually justify what we do - Nieto: I am clearly not in favor of the Liberal Party, but if false information spreads online, I try to correct it - Poe to Nieto: If there's anything, you do excellent research.

That's the kind of mindset that you have. - TP: We're entitled to our own opinion. Trillanes: Okay I'm done with you. TP: screeches. Trillanes: I'm done with you. TP: slams the mike - Trillanes to Mocha: Wala ka nang personal opinion being a senior official of the PCOO. Social media ang trabaho mo. May dividing line ba? PCOO should have limitations because they communicate the government's official line. - Almapay: I think (Uson having a personal blog) is untenable. - Grace Poe: I really think that a personal blog should be let go. Tordesillas: She was appointed sa PCOO kasi kasama yung buong blog. (Government has said that her 5 million followers is why she's Asec for Social Media. Usec Egco said: One post by mocha and you're sure 5m eyeballs na yan. And they maintain na separate yung blog ni mocha??? contradicting much?) - Trillanes to Banaag: PCOO kayo. Ayaw natin ng recklessness na kakalat dito. - Trillanes to Banaag: PCOO has all the resources to verify information. Can you apologize to the media for that malicious statement? Usec Egco declines for Banaag. - Trillanes to Egco: Kayo ang talking heads ng presidente. Dapat naglalabas kayo ng katotohanan lamang. - **Trillanes to Uson: You have a strong influence to the public. Gamitin mo yan in a positive way. You can promote, defend, explain policies. That way, hindi hateful yung cyberspace natin.** - They are making it appear that Andanar acted on unverified information. May natanggap lang daw siya na information, but he had no problems announcing it. - **Uson: I will consider all Trillanes' suggestions regarding my blog if it will benefit my country.** - Pacquiao makes me want to throw shoes at the TV. - Almost shown: Trillanes and Mocha meet. They acknowledged each other. I don't know if they shook hands. - Poe: Misinformation should not have a place in today's society. Takeaways: - PCOO na pala si suspended lawyer Trixie Angeles. - Mark Lopez did not verify the information he got regarding the ""owners of Silent No More"", posts it anyway. - Why we're screwed: TP has more engagement than Rappler. - PCOO had to lay a caveat, just in case Mocha gets grilled. They said everybody is sharing/creating fake news because there is no definitioin. - Mocha and TP want the freedom of journalism without its attendant responsibilities."

I tried PNP but it says they temporarily delisted. I typed in any documents regarding child pornography statistics nothing. I went to PNP's website and check their cybercrime statistics and no proper statistics were given just an estimate for cybercrime in general, but no single number or stats were given for child porn. They were all focused on fraud and whatever credit card fraud there is. For a country that's in the top 3 supplier of child porn every year, they would at least give show us the numbers to raise awareness. "

They both have the same model (IPhone 6) and the accuser wants my relative to give her phone to her until ""her phone shows up"". Anyway, she has no proof and now this accuser is posting ""blind item"" accusing my relative that she stole her phone. I told my relative to ignore it for now, since they are not insinuating that she is the one who stole it. Once they do, then we can slap them a libel suit in conjunction with the Cybercrime law. Given the news, it seems the law is functioning as intended. My question is, am I advising right? Unless the accuser explicitly post that my relative is the one who stole her phone, without any proof, they will be liable to what they say. ----------------- Now to those who are curious. It's unlikely that my relative stole that phone. One, she has the same model. No reason to steal the same model of phone you had. Two, she is a graduating student. Why would you ruin your chances for just an Iphone? Three, money is no issue. We aren't poor and as you can tell by now, she is already graduating. Why steal for money? Lastly, her boyfriend also had the same issue with these people. Came to their house, accused him of stealing their watch. The BF payed, but the CCTV in the house showed that nothing happened. Again, the BF has no money issue. Heck, the BF parents owned a travel agency and is doing very well. Basically, they're rich AF."

I know that they said it's already illegal but there seems to be no action, I don't like it to happen since there are a lot of things I can't have as well. TV shows, Movies, Anime, Games, etc. Not everyone has the money (and time) to buy them (especially if they can't afford them yet or parents disagree with what they can have even if they do have the money, even those conflicting schedules with work). I'm just thinking, how are they planning to stop this? People use VPNs too so I'm not sure what they have in mind. So far, the only ones I notice getting caught are those on TV, whenever there is child abuse, like cybersex dens, and those that involve huge money. Piracy doesn't seem to be much targeted."
