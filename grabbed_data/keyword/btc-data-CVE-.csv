0,CVE-,btc,[Security] Bluetooth vulnerability for Android devices,1,f1h0r3,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/f1h0r3/security_bluetooth_vulnerability_for_android/,2020-02-10 10:16:15,"Publicly released a few days ago [CVE-2020-022](URL If you have Android 10 or the Feb 2020 security update should be fine, otherwise if you use an android hotwallet may want to be more cautious until more info comes out. Generally it's under Settings &gt; System &gt; About &gt; Android Version &gt;On November 3rd, 2019, we have reported a critical vulnerability affecting the Android Bluetooth subsystem. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2020-0022 and was now patched in the latest security patch from February 2020. The security impact is as follows: &gt;On Android 8.0 to 9.0, a remote attacker within proximity can silently execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Bluetooth daemon as long as Bluetooth is enabled. No user interaction is required and only the Bluetooth MAC address of the target devices has to be known. For some devices, the Bluetooth MAC address can be deduced from the WiFi MAC address. This vulnerability can lead to theft of personal data and could potentially be used to spread malware (Short-Distance Worm). &gt;On Android 10, this vulnerability is not exploitable for technical reasons and only results in a crash of the Bluetooth daemon. Android versions even older than 8.0 might also be affected but we have not evaluated the impact. &gt;Users are strongly advised to install the latest available security patch from February 2020. If you have no patch available yet or your device is not supported anymore, you can try to mitigate the impact by some generic behavior rules: &gt;Only enable Bluetooth if strictly necessary. Keep in mind that most Bluetooth enabled headphones also support wired analog audio. Keep your device non-discoverable. Most are only discoverable if you enter the Bluetooth scanning menu. Nevertheless, some older phones might be discoverable permanently."

8,CVE-,btc,AsicBoost and the strange case of CVE-2017-9230,99,8lutv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8lutv4/asicboost_and_the_strange_case_of_cve20179230/,2018-05-25 04:13:44,"# About CVEs In the public interest of tracking and remedying cybersecurity vulnerabilities quickly, a public database was created in 2000: the CVE List [1]. CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. Its database records, known as CVEs, track and record publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each recorded vulnerability has a unique ID and lifecycle where it follows certain states. # The AsicBoost controversy In April 2017, Greg Maxwell published an email [2] on the bitcoin-dev mailing list which described AsicBoost - a patented optimization to the algorithm used in Bitcoin mining - as an attack on the Bitcoin protocol. There was much contention [3] about whether AsicBoost constituted some kind of harmful exploit, or whether it was merely a technological innovation which enabled more efficient mining hardware (ASICs). There were allegations, widely reported in media, that the patent served the interest of Bitmain [4]. The purported benefits of exploiting this patent were contemporaneously disputed by other miners [5]. # CVE-2017-9230 raised against AsicBoost On May 18, Cameron Garnham posted to the bitcoin-dev list [6], urging for getting a CVE assigned to the perceived vulnerability. On May 24, this CVE was created as CVE-2017-9230 [7]. It was simultaneously published under Bugtraq ID 'BID 98657' at [8]. The justification in the CVE stated that the AsicBoost method &gt; 'violates the security assumptions of (1) the choice of input, outside &gt; of the dedicated nonce area, fed into the Proof-of-Work function should &gt; not change its difficulty to evaluate and (2) every Proof-of-Work &gt; function execution should be independent.' It seemed a plausible enough reasoning for the CVE to be assigned. It was entered in the list of Bitcoin-related CVE's at [9]. Detailed information on this particular CVE is still missing/incomplete on the wiki page, a year after the CVE was raised. # What happened since the CVE was raised If you've followed along, you've learned that the CVE was raised to counter the exploitation of the AsicBoost method by miners. Since then, however, a Core developer, BtcDrak, has been involved in the founding of a mining company, Halong Mining. Several online sources state his (part?) ownership of this company. BtcDrak has put forward a proposal [10] which would enable the use of AsicBoost within the Bitcoin Core software (the dominant client software on the BTC network). This proposal appears to directly contradict the CVE claims of how AsicBoost violates ""security assumptions"" of Bitcoin, and indeed does not address how it mitigates them, nor is CVE-2017-9230 referenced in any of its related documentation. While the proposal's specification [11] and implementation [12] have not yet been formally accepted, the situation is that Halong has shipped mining equipment which is now actively employing AsicBoost [13,14] on the Bitcoin (BTC) network. There is even a website showing the blocks where AsicBoost was used [15]. # Conflict of interest There a clear conflict of interest in the actions of the Core developer BtcDrak. His actions as a Core developer appear to be furthering his company's interests and competitive advantage in the mining industry by exploiting a vulnerability of which he must have been keenly aware, having participated on the same bitcoin-dev mailing list where it was discussed. The CVE was vociferously used to paint Bitmain as culpable for delaying Segwit (Bitmain was accused of using AsicBoost and blocking Segwit activation for their own profit motive - claims that Bitmain has publicly denied strongly and which were never substantiated). One might have expected a similar outcry against Halong's *proven* and *announced* use of AsicBoost, but the parties that had previously condemned Bitmain remained mostly silent. Only an anonymous non-developer, Cobra-Bitcoin, co-owner of the bitcoin.org domain, spoke out on the Github pull request in [11], and Core developer Luke-jr spoke out against the use of the proposal on the Bitcoin network while consensus had not been reached on it [16]. Subsequent discussion on the bitcoin-dev list on this topic since March has been minimal and only concerned with technicalities of stratum protocol changes. # The bigger elephant in the room It seems logical that either AsicBoost constitutes an exploitable weakness, and thus merits a CVE and measures taken to prevent its use on the Bitcoin network entirely. Or it is not a problem and the CVE should be invalidated. The Bitcoin Core project should use its consensus processes to arrive at a coherent decision. # Other problems raised by the use of overt AsicBoost The Halong implementation uses version rolling of the `nversion` bits of the header. It reserves a subset of those bits for overt AsicBoost. These bits are no longer available to BIP9, but there was no update of BIP9 proposed to address this impact. This is a question of sensible procedures being followed (or not). The author did not find any review comment mentioning the lack of BIP9 specification update, which suggest a lack of thorough review on a proposal which dates back several months. A minor issue is that the Core implementation warns when a certain proportion of unrecognized version bits are detected. This behavior can be triggered by the AsicBoost method used on the network. --- [1] URL [2] URL [3] URL [4] URL [5] URL [6] URL [7] URL [8] URL [9] URL [10] URL [11] URL [12] URL [13] URL [14] URL [15] URL [16] URL"
9,CVE-,btc,Formal dispute of CVE-2017-9230 (claimed Bitcoin vulnerability due to AsicBoost),34,8mdp76,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8mdp76/formal_dispute_of_cve20179230_claimed_bitcoin/,2018-05-27 08:42:51,"%begin 27 May 2018 BtcFork hereby registers a formal dispute of CVE-2017-9230. The CVE list will be notified accordingly. Our view is that what has been described in CVE-2017-9230 as an ""attack methodology"" is a benign mining optimization. Since the CVE was raised, a Bitcoin Core developer has overtly implemented a change request to the software and caused this optimization to be available and actively used in Bitcoin (BTC) mining. This is documented in the summary below which concludes that either the CVE is a real problem and should be fixed, or the overt support of the method now should be considered grounds to invalidate the CVE. URL Bitcoin mining pools such as Slush Pool have since embraced ASICBOOST (the common name describing the method, based on the well known patent of that name) as a legitimate optimization on Bitcoin. There are no active proposals within the Bitcoin Core project to prevent such use, strongly suggesting that the CVE is no longer considered a vulnerability. Further evidence that CVE-2017-9230 was initially disputed can be found in the links below: URL URL BtcFork invites others to submit further evidence that this 'vulnerability' / 'attack' constitutes a mining optimization and not a vulnerability of the Bitcoin network which merits a CVE.

Casual googling revealed that Gavin was responsible for fixing the most recent serious CVE (CVE-2013-4165): URL URL Meanwhile I found that Luke-Jr was committing stuff that had been rejected during unrelated merges: URL URL Scalability work from Gavin: URL Another CVE by Gavin (CVE-2013-3219): URL Level db errors? Gavin again: URL To be fair Core related Peter Wuille seems to be responsible for headers first synchronization and I'm sure Core people did more. However considering that we know Maxwell falsely claimed Github commits and the above findings I would say a pattern emerges: Core people doing small things/hacking to get credibility and Gavin actually fixing some big issues Core is now boasting about. I'm not saying Core has been completely useless, I'm just saying they are considerably less essential than people repeating the mantra ""Core has done great work"" seem to think. Let me know if you find more or I'm wrong about something."
