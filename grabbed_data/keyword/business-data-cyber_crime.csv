Any improvements, or tips you could suggest will be much appreciated. Thanks Biography - John Doe, Principal Consultant Hi, my name is John Doe. I'm a former fraudster and now a fraud prevention specialist. I founded Fraud Comms in 2019 to help online merchants protect their businesses against fraud. Now you're probably wondering why someone with my background would make such a dramatic change. Well, I got caught and convicted of computer fraud and credit card fraud in 2018. After that I didn't want to return to cyber crime. But I still got to making a living somehow, right?...so I decided to switch to fraud prevention. May be the story isn't quite that simple. There are actually a few reasons I made the switch. First and foremost, I could sit here and pretend how I wanted to right the wrongs of my past by reinventing myself as a fraud fighting crusader. But I'd be lying. I spent a few years doing card-not-present fraud and anyone with my level of experience doesn't suddenly ""see the light"" once they get caught. The truth is I have dreams and aspirations like everyone else. I wanted to start a online business that required nothing more than a laptop. That way I can travel the world, live in different countries and met different people. And I won't be restricted to living in any one place. This is something I couldn't do as a fraudster because running a fraud operation that targeted and monetized physical goods meant that I had to stay in one location. I couldn't travel the world except for going on the odd holiday. My other motivation for getting into fraud prevention is that I find it interesting, which is an understatement. Fraud prevention has become my obsession. In fraud the hustle never stops, whether I'm out fishing or walking my dog, my mind was constantly ticking over thinking about fraud schemes. There was no off switch. I found the same to be true in fraud prevention. So even in my spare time my mind will be constantly ticking over thinking of the most effective ways to fix your fraud problems."
