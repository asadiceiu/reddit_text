1,cyber crime,The_Donald,Mueller's report is full of self-contradictory stupidity,73,cc2h7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/cc2h7e/muellers_report_is_full_of_selfcontradictory/,2019-07-12 08:40:34,"Based on analysis by Aaron Mat, published here: [Muellers Own Report Undercuts Its Core Russia-Meddling Claims](URL It's a long read as it sites the report directly. Jimmy Dore interviewed him recently and the video was shared here on t\_d but didn't get much traction: [Lefty Jimmy Dore eviscerates the Muller report point by point.](URL The video is really good, but I'd imagine not many people watched it since it's 30+ min long. So I thought I'd compile some of that ridiculous stupidity Mueller was called out on in the article and the video: &amp;#x200B; * Made a claim Russian intelligence hacked DNC, Russian government-linked troll farms orchestrated far-reaching campaign to promote Trump. - NONE of these claims were proven by his investigation. (he actually debunked this claim later in the report) * Core crime as described by Mueller was GRU's (Russian intellegence's) theft of DNC emails. Mueller's conclusion is GRU **""appear to have stolen""** emails. Word **appear** was used because he has no proof or evidence of that. * Report states Mueller's team didn't determine how WikiLeaks got the emails. Even though before he was saying it was someone linked to Russia who gave the info to WikiLeaks. * Report's timeline is a mess. According to it, Julian Assange announced the publication of the emails **before** he acually got anything and **before** he even had his first contact with the source that provided the leaked emails. ~~Julian time traveling god - confirmed.~~ * According to Mueller's investigation two Russian operatives, one of which was an officer of GRU (Russian intelligence) were sliding into each other's dm's on twitter and talked about their covert activities there. * A comment from Jimmy Dore illustrates well how dumb this all is - *""Really? So this highly sophisticated Russian spy op thing...they're really communicating through dm's on twitter, which they know the NSA is fucking monitoring! ARE YOU SHITTING ME??? That what we supposed to believe?""* * A twitter user Guccifer 2.0 (Russian intelligence officer according to Mueller who gave emails to WikiLeaks following GRU's hack of DNC) appeared **AFTER** Assange announced he has the emails. That user took credit for the hack, released some low tier files from DNC that contained metadata which makes it easy to discover the file came from a Russian speaker. * *Here's the most hilarious thing: according to the metadata on the files, the user had the name of the founder of Soviet Secret police as his pc-username...this is so cartoonishly idiotic. Well at least it wasn't XxXStalin\_GulagXxX.* * Mueller never spoke or shown any interest of speaking to Jillian Assange when he's the central figure in all of the mess who has actual knowledge of what really happened. He has quotes from Assange in the report, but never spoke directly during whole 2 year investigation and with unlimited resources at his disposal. * FBI never inspected the server, they relied on the forensics of a private company Crowdstrike. Crowdstrike worked for DNC. * Crowdstike submitted **redacted** report **to the FBI** (the private company redacted information itself and passed it on to the FBI with redaction) and the agency had no issues with that. * Crowdstike's co-founder and current CTO (chief technology officer) - Dmitri Alperovitch is Russian, moved to the US at the age of 14, hates Putin. * Crowdstike had to retract a key to the investigation statement that Russia carried out hacking operations in Ukraine and used the same malware inside the DNC hacking operation. * Crowdstike's president - Shawn Henry **worked for Mueller in the FBI** and **was appointed by him** back 2010 as the executive assistant director (EAD) of the Criminal, Cyber, Response, and Services Branch (CCRSB). [FBI press archive](URL * NSA has a copy of everything happening online, if the hack happened online as Mueller claimed, NSA would be able to provide very accurate information, down the second, on when the info was taken and where it went. All this is according to Bill Binney - An NSA whistle-blower and number one code breaker in the history of NSA, interviewed by Jimmy Dore. He also said ""the reason they can't provide evidence is because it doesn't exist"" * Binney is skeptical that NSA intelligence was used to write the report or indictment of GRU. Everything was based on an assessment of Intelligence community. * Aaron Mat asked National Security Division, NSA, Mueller's spokesperson whether any information was declassified for publication. (Any NSA information has to go through declassification by default) No one confirmed it happened. Which made Bill Binney (former NSA technical director) confident no NSA intelligence was used. &amp;#x200B; On Mueller debunking himself I mentioned earlier: &gt;Russian government-linked troll farms orchestrated far-reaching campaign to promote Trump. - none of these claims were proven by his investigation. (he actually debunked this claim later in the report) &amp;#x200B; Report doesn't directly attribute troll farms' memesters to be working for Russian government. So memes on facebook (Mueller called systematic interference from Russian government prior) according to...well...himself in the report, he has zero proof. He *suggests* the involvement of the Russian Government based on: * owner of a troll farm is a rich dude who knows Putin * one article in New York Times Most of facebook ads ran after the election. And as many know by know - those were just some hilarious random nonsense. &amp;#x200B; * According to Mueller's report IRA (internet research agency, aka troll farm) spent $46 000 on Russian linked facebook ads before 2016. * majority of which had little to do with elections. *That's why they don't show all that dangerous, election meddling propaganda as evidence huh?* To better illustrate how mental it is: Hillary and Trump ads amount to $81 000 000 and around $2 000 000 000 on top if you include money spent by candidates and their supporting PACS. &amp;#x200B; Investigation is a joke, Mueller is a joke, his self-contradicting report is a joke."

TRUMP IS NEEDED DOWN UNDER TO SAVE US FROM CHINER AND OUR DUMBOCRAT ELEETS ARE INVITING IN CHINER!,0,bmvfa3,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/bmvfa3/sos_trump_is_needed_down_under_to_save_us_from/,2019-05-10 17:40:27,"Very important stuff from Clive Hamilton today: Understanding Chinas Threat to Australias National Security As long at the Communist Party rules China it will pose a persistent and serious threat to Australias national security. Over the last two years we have made considerable progress in setting up defences against Beijings subversion and covert influence. But we have only just begun a decade-long project, at least, of undoing the influence networks that the CCP has already established. Momentum is being slowed by institutional inertia, and Beijing has mobilized its friends of China among Australias elites to push back, including attempts to erode public confidence in our intelligence agencies. Beijing is exploiting our democratic processes, our legal system, and our free press. Its also exploiting multiculturalism as a cover for its influence activities. The accusation of Sinophobia or anti-Chinese prejudice is a powerful silencing device. Those whose voices have been most quieted are of course ChineseAustralians who want to speak out for human rights in China, or against the injustices in Tibet and Xinjiang. We are only now becoming aware that Beijings interference in our political system goes well beyond the activities of wealthy, Party-linked donors. In recent years, the Chinese Communist Party, through its global United Front network, has been actively encouraging trusted members of Chinese communities in countries like Australia to become directly involved in running 1 Professor of public ethics, Charles Sturt University, Canberra. 2 for political office, a policy known as huaren canzheng (pronounced hua wren ts-an jung). The policy, literally meaning ethnic Chinese political participation, also involves mobilising overseas Chinese community organisations to form one unified voice, and supporting mainstream candidates who have a correct understanding of Chinese people and China. Political organizations with names like the Chinese Labor Association and the Chinese Liberal Club are now operating inside Australias two main political parties. Some members of them are using their growing influence to promote Beijings interests. This approach is related to the mixing sand (chan shazi) tactic advocated by Mao Zedong, that is, planting trusted people in the enemys ranks in order to weaken them. Unlike Russia, which carried out an ambitious campaign of interference intended to benefit Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the CCP is bipartisan in its activities in Australia. It aims to build influence across the political spectrum, and be able to sway whomever wins. Huaren canzheng has been actively promoted by Huang Xiangmo, the real estate mogul and political donor who in February was excluded from Australia because of ASIOs concerns about his CCP links. When in 2015 he was president of the Australian Council for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification of China, the core United Front organisation, Huang wrote an article titled On the new age of huaren canzheng. Its vital, he wrote, to rally ethnic Chinese forces to use their ballots, make political donations and master the rules of the political game. In recent years, United Front groups in Australia have been holding training seminars to encourage trusted Chinese-Australians to participate in politics. Theyre aimed particularly at young Chinese-Australians who are more integrated into Australian society. Huang Xiangmo wrote of the need to nurture those with bilingual skills who can walk through the revolving door of politics, business and academia with ease. In addition, for some years CCP agencies have been organizing so-called Discovery Trips to China for overseas Chinese. There they meet senior Chinese government leaders, listen to speeches given by experts, attend discussion forums and build networks. This program is part of the CCPs broader qiaowu program, which CCP expert James Jiann Hua To describes as a massive operation aimed at co-opting overseas Chinese and managing their behaviour and perceptions through incentives or disincentives to suit the situation and structural circumstances that the CCP desires. In short, both the training seminars in Australia and the Discovery Trips to China are elements of a CCP program designed to groom young ChineseAustralians to serve the interests of the Party-state. Some candidates currently standing for election to federal parliament have participated in these training programs and the Discovery Trips to China. They also have close links with United Front organisations and influential figures from the Chinese diaspora who act on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party. Over the last 18 months, some 15 federal politicians have been disqualified because of their dual citizenship. They fell afoul of Section 44 of the Constitution, which rules ineligible anyone who is a citizen of another country. Now the parties are doing their due diligence by forensically checking each potential candidate for dual citizenship. The trips are organised by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office and China Overseas Exchange Association, both agencies of the Chinese Communist Partys United Front Work Department (UFWD), a powerful branch of the CCP tasked with influencing and controlling groups outside the party, including groups located abroad. But the same clause of Section 44 also disqualifies any person who is under any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power. The political parties ought to be doing their due diligence to rule out any potential candidates who are engaged in United Front activity. As the CCPs huaren canzheng policy begins to bear fruit federally, as it already has done in state parliaments and local councils, sooner or later I expect to see an MP challenged in the High Court. We know that ASIO is gathering more detailed information on Beijings attempts to co-opt Chinese-Australians and has expressed concern about CCPlinked individuals entering parliaments. (In Canada, where the process of penetration has gone further, CSIS has done likewise, although its warnings have been dismissed by a compromised political class.) Such a High Court challenge would be disastrous for future representation of the Chinese-Australian community in federal parliament, so the parties must start thinking much more carefully about this problem. It should be stressed that Chinese-Australians are under-represented in Australian political office and more should be encouraged to enter politics, but not if they are liable to be disqualified under Section 44. *** Our intelligence and law enforcement authorities have, by all accounts, been highly effective at identifying and arresting actual and potential terrorists. By contrast, they have been reluctant to prosecute individuals engaged in economic espionage and spying. In recent years, the United States has launched a series of high-profile prosecutions of Chinese spies and agents of influence who have engaged in unlawful activity. Even Canada, which is more in thrall to Beijing than Australia, has put spies before the courts. Yet in Australia there have been none. This is not for want of malign activity, as recent ASIO reports have made clear, but for lack of political will. Fear of Beijings ire is allowing its program of data theft, information gathering and cyber-hacking to proliferate. And with the passage last year of the Espionage and Foreign Interference Act there is a new crime to tackle. Foreign interference is a crime if it involves activity that is covert, directed or funded by a foreign principal, and is intended to influence a political or governmental process or the exercise of a democratic or political right . Such activity has been rampant in Australia, as a reading of my book will reveal. State police forces have, or ought to have, a large share of the responsibility for uncovering and prosecuting individuals engaged in unlawful foreign interference. Most of it takes place at a local level. Yet state police forces have not committed the resources to understanding the nature and extent of foreign interference that is taking place in their backyards. Admittedly, its a daunting task. They must first develop a comprehensive map of United Front actors and organisations, and then work out what kind of activity might be unlawful. It means penetrating a world that is opaque and unfamiliar. The modus operandi of the CCP is like nothing we have experienced before; certainly the old rules of the Cold War are not of much use, and viewing it through a le Carr lens only obscures things. Fortunately, there are members of the Chinese-Australian community very willing to help. But there is another strong reason for state police forces to put themselves at the forefront of investigating foreign interference. Just as the Kremlin uses criminal gangs to carry out some of its work, and oligarchs have business partnerships with organised crime bosses, there has always been a nexus between the Chinese Communist Partys overseas influence activities and criminal gangs. In Canada, the media has exposed evidence of enormous sums of dark money from China being laundered through Vancouver casinos and real estate. Some of the criminals have political links, both in China and in Canada. The provincial and federal governments have been reluctant to face up to the problem and do something about it. The reasons are complex: it looks overwhelming, the crooks have friends in high places, the crippling fear of accusations of xenophobia, and billions of dollars flowing into government coffers from gambling. I am asking myself whether Australia is in the same boat, ignoring major crimes that are mixed up in political influence activity?FBI Director Christopher Wray recently commented on another aspect of the merging of crime and politics. He said the FBI is focusing on what he called a blended threat where cybercrime and espionage merge together in all kinds of new ways. He described how China, above all, poses a severe intelligence threat because its stealing U.S. assets like advanced technology and commercial innovations, and collecting information for political use. And then he said something that we in Australia are reluctant to admit. China [by which he meant the CCP] has pioneered a societal approach to stealing innovation in any way it can from a wide array of businesses, universities and organizations. Theyre doing it through Chinese intelligence services, through state-owned enterprises, through ostensibly private companies, through graduate students and researchers, through a variety of actors all working on behalf of China. The term blended threat refers to nation states using criminal hackers; but here I am describing something slightly different, criminals becoming agents of influence for nation states, and nation states willingly using them. 7 All of this is being played out in Australia too; yet we do not want to admit it, for fear of being accused of racial profiling or because of our anxieties about annoying Beijing. ASIO has a good idea of the landscape, and has been writing about it in recent annual reports. The Director-General Duncan Lewis put it succinctly when he wrote that foreign actors are aggressively seeking access to privileged and classified information on Australias alliances, on our diplomatic, technological, economic and military secrets and on our energy and mineral resources. These foreign actors, he wrote: are also attempting to clandestinely influence the opinions of members of the Australian public and media, Australian Government officials, and members of Australia-based diaspora communities. Yet the Director-General would not name China as the party overwhelmingly responsible for this subversion and espionage. In fact, China is not mentioned once in ASIOs report. Russia is, several times; even earning an index entry Russian intelligence activity in Australia. Theres no entry for China even though Chinas intelligence activity is a hundred-fold greater. This is exactly how Beijing wants it: a thorough program of espionage and subversion that we are too afraid to talk about. The same coyness was on display in February when it was revealed that a sophisticated state actor had hacked into the computer systems of both of our main political parties. The government would not reveal the source of the attack, although it knew it was China. Again, the government was intimidated into silence by Beijing. The message we are sending is that if you do it again we will not call you out. The contrast with the United States could not be sharper. There, in addition to forthright statements from the FBI and the CIA directors, the US-China 8 Economic and Security Review Commission recently issued a report to Congress describing Chinas subversive activities, as far as they are known. A bill is moving through Congress that would legislate for an annual report detailing Chinas interference activities. *** Sunlight is the best disinfectant against Beijings covert, coercive and corrupt activities in Australia. Yet, the Australian government is keeping us in the dark, leaving the task of pulling back the curtains to a handful of journalists and academics, who must then take the blowback. The best source of information on Beijings activities is of course the Chinese-Australian community itself. They do much more than we know; yet they live in fear of material retribution from the CCP and its agents. And, its sad to say, they dont believe that the Australian government will adequately protect them. If we are to prevail in this new era of political warfare, to use the CCPs term, a whole-of-society threat requires a whole-of-society response; but that cannot happen if the public is kept in the dark. At the moment, the government is signalling that there is a serious threat to our sovereignty and our democratic system. Yet it seems to be saying leave it to us, we will take care of it. Even a determined government cannot respond adequately to this new kind of threat. U.S. authorities are further down the track. They have been engaged in a major outreach exercise to American companies and universities, to explain the nature of the risks they face from Chinas network of influence and technology theft. Something like this has been taking place in Australia on a smaller and more tentative scale, but so much more needs to be done. Its clear that our universities, in particular, are resistant to hearing the message and continue to expose themselves to a range of risks. For example, some Australian universities have entered into partnerships with Chinese companies and universities that are likely steal their intellectual property. The universities claim they do due diligence on the Chinese companies they partner with. But the companies they pay to carry out due diligence do not know what to look for or how to look. Work by Alex Joske has exposed many instances of Australian universities happily hosting Chinese scientists who turn out to be officers of the Peoples Liberation Army specialising in weapons research and other military-related research. Not only are universities unaware but, when its pointed out, some dont appear to be unduly worried. To borrow a metaphor from one authority on the CCP (Frank Diktter), they are like Boy Scouts up against Don Corleone. In the cyber domain, I think the public, along with government organizations and private companies, have been persuaded that they need to do more to protect their information from cyber attackers, including sophisticated state actors. But its a mistake to think that all they need to do is harden their perimeter defences against outside threats. Possibly the greater threat comes from within, insider threats, or malicious insiders as ASIO has called them. As you know, all it takes is for someone with access to a computer network to stick into a port a USB that then downloads malware. It would be incorrect to think that the risk is from MSS moles being sent in. Thats le Carr thinking. Far more likely is an employee who comes under great pressure to engage in malicious activity. Its a much harder problem to respond to sensitively, but the starting point is to frame it correctly, and that is that most Chinese-Australians are the victims here. Lastly, building on its almost total domination of Chinese-language media in Australia, Beijing has weaponised Chinese-language social media. WeChat is used heavily by most Chinese-Australians. Many rely on it as their main source of news and opinion. Now, accounts are being doctored and fake news stories are being spread to shape opinions in electorates with large diaspora populations. WeChat is owned by Chinese conglomerate Tencent, which is controlled by Ma Huateng (Pony Ma), Chinas richest man and a firm supporter of the Party. WeChat cannot be regulated by Australian authorities, but it is subject to censorship in Beijing. This means that Australian politicians using WeChat to communicate with voters are censoring themselves, or rather their Mandarinspeaking staff members censor their posts so as not to attract the attention of Beijings censors. The Labor Party has written to Tencent to complain about fake news stories on WeChat. WeChat is not subject to pressure like Facebook or Twitter, so its a futile exercise, if a necessary one. I would urge those politicians to challenge the censors by sending out posts condemning the outrages in Xinjiang or praising the Dalai Lama, as a way of standing up for free speech in Australia. Beyond that, we must come up with innovative responses to Beijings exploitation of free speech. My essential message then is that we are faced with a new kind of adversary that practices espionage and political interference in ways that are alien to us as experts. They are practices that subtly exploit the openness of our institutions and the boundaries we place around them. They operate in the grey zone. We are being forced to take a crash course in a new world of huaren canzheng, citizen spies and blended threats. To respond will require great flexibility in the way we think and a willingness to adapt our institutions."

The dox is so precise that it gets down to the borough of the city in which he lives in. Everything that the person is affiliated with is all laid out in the article. &gt;Included in the article is this quote by the guy expressing concern to Poulsen: &gt; Im in [City], he said. Very liberal. People make judgments. I just don't want to be linked to a conservative right-winger and be potentially denied services and stuff People are nasty. You should see some of the messages that are coming in. &gt;And yet, he still thought it's fine to publish this article. The EIC of The Daily Beast, Noah Shachtman, was also particularly giddy with this ""scoop"" of shit, tweeting out: &gt; I know ""stand by for news"" tweets are played out. But I want to tell you about a story posting at 7:30 that I am very excited about. What to do? &gt;Not to be outdone, CNN's own media janitor Brian Stelter retweeted the article by Kevin Poulsen. CNN, if you would recall, infamously threatened to dox the guy that made the WWE meme video of Trump wrestling the CNN logo. &gt;But this isn't The Daily Beast's first engagement with the journo sport of hunting down private citizens for malicious purposes. Will Sommer published an article in February doxing an employee of one of Trump's private businesses for the high crime of supposedly believing in a conspiracy theory. The article is still up, of course. &gt;This is all particularly egregious shit. None of these articles should exist. None of these private citizens are newsworthy in any way, shape, or form. They have been made newsworthy by malicious and morally-bankrupt smear merchants. This is all obvious to any honest person. They're either blind to their journalistic malpractice, or they don't give a fuck. Either way, they're unfit for the roles they play and should be rooted out by their more principled colleagues. They'll keep their jobs and still be respected individuals in your friends-of-the-people media. &gt;Edit: Clint Watts promoted and praised the article on Twitter: &gt; Hats off to @kpoulsen. Great work. We Found The Guy Behind the Viral Drunk Pelosi Video &gt;He's the author of ""Messing with the Enemy: Surviving in a Social Media World of Hackers, Terrorists, Russians, and Fake News"" and a senior fellow at the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security at George Washington University and a Foreign Policy Research Institute fellow.

6,cyber crime,The_Donald,Don't Misgender Me! A story I made a while back,1,b95mai,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/b95mai/dont_misgender_me_a_story_i_made_a_while_back/,2019-04-04 10:57:03," Don't Misgender Me! **Trigger Warning:** If you need trigger warnings, do not read this. In all of the 50 states, Connecticut held the reputation of being the most liberal of all of them. The year is 2025, all scientific progress has slowed to a halt because it was deemed too racist against other people's religion. The border was opened to all who wished to enter, with no passport required anywhere in the world. America eventually turned into a highly socialist or possibly even communist country in an attempt by president Hillary Clinton to create a society where everyone was equal. All wealth was redistributed to everyone in equal amounts, no matter how much money anyone else made. The police were deemed racist and so black lives matter movement installed the Social Justice Enforcement Squad in replace of them. Hillary Clinton was finally elected president, and she implemented reforms that allowed her to stay in power even longer than before, allowing her to spread several more waves of feminism and tolerance all across the United States of America. In this society, our gender fluid queer transmasculine gendervoid apache attack helicopter by the name of Monica was walking down the street one day. She noticed a middle aged man looking at her strangely. Empowered by the resistance of the patriarchy, she bravely walked over and confronted him. You CIS scum! The feminist shouted. I beg your pardon, maam? He replied and looked at her. Did you just assume my gender?!? Why are you sexually looking at me! Im not into landwhales, sorry he replied. Police! She yelled. This racist white male raped me! Monica shouted at the top of her lungs. The social justice enforcement officers shoved him to the ground, put him in handcuffs, and dragged him into the distance. He was to be executed immediately. He had committed one of the worst crimes possible, stare rape. To top that, he assumed her gender. It was established in 2022 by the revised sexual harassment act that all white men are to look down at the ground, as to not offend the women by looking at her. Misgendering someone was another serious crime. If someone was misgendered, their feelings could be hurt, and that was almost worse than death in society today. Monica continued on with her journey. She went to a local mart, and saw a robbery taking place. They were tall, lean, but most importantly, dark skinned. One of them shot the cashier. These robbers are out of control someone must put a stop to this! she cried. We cant. Said the social justice officers who looked on at the crime going on from the window next to her. We dont have any weapons because they look scary and hurt people. Also because we cant arrest african americans. It would be extremely racist to do so and would be an even greater crime than the death of a white male. White people are the majority, African Americans are the minority so their lives are worth more than white lives. Monica looked on as the robber got away with his fortune. She decided to move on. She continued walking down, she had almost burned off 20 pounds in the 10 minutes she was walking. Exercise was rare nowadays because everyone is beautiful the way they are and fat shaming was punishable by death like most of the other newly implemented laws. The need for a womyn to clean, exercise or put makeup on was was removed. All common courtesy had been removed, the only thing that mattered was to not hurt anyone's feelings. As a result, the average womyn looked and acted about the same as a deranged grizzly bear. Monica approached a christian church. She heard someone yell in a savage voice, ALLAHU AKBAR! A nearby christian church went up in a fireball as the ear breaking crack of explosives struck her ears. We were lucky that the church was closed today said an old man. Ever since the border was opened to everyone by Hillary Clinton, the amount of muslims have increased tenfold, along with attacks such as these. Said another. Islam isnt the problem you racist. It's a lone wolf. Islam is peaceful She said in a disgusted tone I had to move to a new church because my last one was blown up. It seems this one has suffered the same fate along with many others. Monica would normally have been furious over this use of logic, but a wave of fatigue hit her from walking half a block, so she decided to go home instead of acting like an idiotic child. Monica arrive at her run down apartment complex to see her child crying on the ground, holding a handgun to her head! I cant take it anymore! Goodbye cruel world! Why do you have a gun! Guns are evil monsters that hurt people! I cant let you have an AR-15 assault rifle! Those fully automatic rifles fire at least 200 rounds per second! She took the gun away from her child. Mom please help me it's the patriarchy again! What's wrong, has someone misgendered you? Have the CIS white males raped you? No, that's not it, someone is cyber bullying me! Someone didnt agree with my opinion and are oppressing me! she said. Monica walked over to the computer, and looked at the screen. You have the intelligence of a mentally challenged pine cone. Get off this website please. Who sent you this?! Monica said in an outrage. Some person on the internet posed it, when I was talking about how the wage gap oppresses females everywhere. They were using actual facts against my feelings! her daughter replied in a frightened tone. Monica took the computer in her large meaty arms, and with a roar of a thousand t-rexs, tossed it straight out the window. She watched it fall and shatter into a dozen pieces as it hit the ground several stories below her. Justice. She said with a smile on her face. The telephone rang, she picked it up. Monica walked over to the couch and turned on the T.V. Due to the no fly zone implemented by Hillary Clinton in Syria, a Russian fighter was shot down, provoking nuclear war with the country. More to come after our program *Feelings Feelings and more Feelings* by feminist Laci Green! She noticed a peculiar light in the sky, it seemed to be getting brighter and brighter. She noticed more and more of these bright lights up in the sky. One of them hit the ground. Then another, and another. The ground shook and the bombs lit up the night sky. As more and more hit the ground, Monica realised that it was all over, humanity had failed itself once and for all."
7,cyber crime,The_Donald,Its been 764 days since trump has been in office. When will all the horrific things the liberals claim if he took office start?,218,au9jmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/au9jmx/its_been_764_days_since_trump_has_been_in_office/,2019-02-25 03:30:36,"IGNITING A HISTORIC ECONOMIC BOOM: President Trumps pro-growth policies are unleashing economic growth and providing opportunities to workers across the country. Due to President Trumps pro-growth policies, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth exceeded 3 percent over the last four quarters. Real GDP grew at annual rates of 3.4 percent in the third quarter of 2018 and 4.2 percent in the second quarter. More than 5 million jobs have been created since President Trumps election and the unemployment rate remains below 4 percent. This is the eighth time this year that the unemployment rate has been below 4 percent. Prior to this year, the unemployment rate had fallen below 4 percent only five times since 1970. The unemployment rate for African Americans in May fell to 5.9 percent, which is the lowest rate on record. Asian and Hispanic-American unemployment rates have reached record lows this year. Initial weekly jobless claims have hit a nearly 50-year low under President Trump. Under President Trump, job openings outnumber the unemployed for the first time on record. Recently, more than two-thirds of Americans rated now as a good time to find a quality job, tying a record high in a poll by Gallup. Americans are seeing more money in their pockets thanks to the booming economy. In recent months, workers have seen their largest nominal year over year wage growth in nearly a decade. In 2017, real median household income rose to a post-recession high. President Trumps policies are helping to lift Americans out of poverty. African-American and Hispanic-American poverty rates reached record lows of 21.2 percent and 18.3 percent, respectively, in 2017. Since the election, 4.6 million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps. Consumer confidence has soared under President Trump, recently reaching an 18-year high. President Trump is delivering on his promise to bring back American manufacturing. The National Association of Manufacturers Outlook Index had the highest annual average in its history over the past year. Manufacturing added 284,000 jobs in 2018, the most added in a year since 1997 Small Business optimism jumped to a record high under President Trump, according to a survey by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). The NFIBs Small Business Optimism Index broke a 35-year record in August. President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law, ushering in the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. These tax cuts are delivering real results for American families and workers. More than 6 million workers received tax cut bonuses and benefits. More than 100 utility companies have announced lower rates. President Trump is ensuring American workers receive the training and education they need to compete in todays economy. President Trump signed an executive order establishing the National Council for the American worker. More than 185 companies and associations have signed our Pledge to Americas Workers, promising more than 6.4 million new training and career opportunities. The President signed legislation that reauthorized the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, making more than $1 billion available for career education programs. President Trump has prioritized the economic empowerment of women. The womens unemployment rate recently reached its lowest rate in 65 years. The Small Business Administration lent approximately $500 million more in capital to women-owned businesses in 2017 compared to 2016. The Administration helped launch the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, which could leverage more than $1 billion to support women entrepreneurs.

Once enacted by Congress, the United StatesMexicoCanada Agreement (USMCA) will better serve the interests of American workers and businesses.

After years of stifling regulation under the last Administration, President Trump is unleashing Americas energy potential. America is the largest crude oil producer in the world and production has hit a record high. President Trumps policies are helping to boost American energy exports. The Administration has streamlined Liquefied Natural Gas terminal permitting. In 2017, the United States became a net natural gas exporter for the first time in 60 years.

President Trump has expanded association health plans, allowing more employers to join together across State lines and affordably offer coverage to their employees. The Administration proposed a reform to Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) regulations that will give consumers more freedom to purchase benefits that fit their needs.

Americans have more healthcare freedom thanks to the President signing legislation that ended Obamacares individual mandate penalty. While healthcare premiums had been steadily increasing as a result of Obamacare, the average benchmark exchange premium will decline for the first time in 2019 thanks to President Trumps policies. Next year, Americans will benefit from more insurer participation on the exchanges.

Okay, Trump announced his candidacy on June 16th, 2015 (almost 3 years ago), and after having his campaign treated as an absolute joke, he goes on a rampage winning debate after debate which snowballed into something much bigger. Let me just recount the number of victories Trump had since then: * That whole Megyn Kelly thingy that caused a big liberal melt-down, and almost a year later Megyn Kelly was there begging for an conciliatory interview. * Counter-attacking McCain by saying he didn't like people who were captured. * Winning almost all of the Republican debates one after another. * Coming out on top of the Republican primary. * WINNING THE NOMINATION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. * Taking on Clinton along with the entire entourage of FAKE NEWS that was backing her, single-handedly. * Destroying Crooked Hillary in the first Presidential debate. * Overcoming the whole ""Sexual Assault"" scandal triggered by the ""leaked"" Access Hollywood tape -- most people thought he was done for, at this point -- but no, Trump knows how to win. * Destroying Crooked Hillary in the second Presidential 'town-hall' style debate. * Destroying Crooked Hillary in the third Presidential debate -- ending the whole thing with the words, ""With """"HER,"" all you're going to get is a THIRD Obummer term."" * WINNING THE FUCKING PRESIDENCY! * Taking on the FABRICATED Russia Hoax, including that stupid fucking Steele dossier. * Taking on all of the shouts and screams for his impeachment from the retarded and delusional liberal dimwits. * Taking on the ROTTEN AND SUPER CORRUPTED MEDIA and dismantling it by using their own tactics against them. * Overcoming a chaotic early White House with an array of clashing opinion. * Firing that slime-ball Comey -- a real fucking disgrace to the United States DoJ. * Taking on North Korea with tactically calculated rhetoric to bring Kim to the table (while pressurizing Mr. Xi to enable the required conditions). * Fucking Mueller Witch-Hunt. ... I mean, I can go on and on here... My point is, HOW MAY THINGS HAS THIS MAN TAKEN ON IN LESS THAN 3 YEARS? A lot of things. A LOT. OF. THINGS. And the things he has accomplished?

Sauce: https:// URL ANALYSIS/OPINION: With the clearly unethical and most likely criminal behavior of the upper management levels of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) exposed by Chairman Devin Nunes of the House Intelligence Committee, there are two complementary areas that have been conveniently swept under the rug. The first deals with the murder of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) staffer Seth Rich, and the second deals with the alleged hacking of the DNC server by Russia. Both should be of prime interest to special counsel Robert Mueller, but do not hold your breath. The facts that we know of in the murder of the DNC staffer, Seth Rich, was that he was gunned down blocks from his home on July 10, 2016. Washington Metro police detectives claim that Mr. Rich was a robbery victim, which is strange since after being shot twice in the back, he was still wearing a $2,000 gold necklace and watch. He still had his wallet, key and phone. Clearly, he was not a victim of robbery. This has all the earmarks of a targeted hit job. However, strangely no one has been charged with this horrific crime, and what is more intriguing is that no law enforcement agency is even investigating this murder. According to other open sources, Metro police were told by their higher ups that if they spoke about the case, they will be immediately terminated. It has been claimed that this order came down from very high up the food chain, well beyond the D.C. mayors office. Interesting. One more unexplained twist is that on July 10, 2016, the same day Seth Rich was murdered, an FBI agents car was burglarized in the same vicinity. Included in the FBI equipment stolen was a 40 caliber Glock 22. D.C. Metro police issued a press release, declaring that the theft of the FBI agents car occurred between 5 and 7 a.m. Two weeks later, the FBI changed the time of the theft to between 12 a.m. and 2 a.m. Was the FBI gun used to shoot Seth Rich? Neither the FBI nor the Metro police will discuss. Another aspect that needs to be uncovered is the FBIs denial that its cyber experts who share space with the D.C. Metro police department at Cleveland Avenue in the District, assisted in accessing data on Mr. Richs laptop. Not likely. Data on the laptop revealed that Mr. Rich downloaded thousands of DNC emails and was in touch with Wikileaks. The file with evidence of what was on Mr. Richs laptop sits with the FBI in a co-shared space with the D.C. police department. According to Ed Butowsky, an acquaintance of the family, in his discussions with Joel and Mary Rich, they confirmed that their son transmitted the DNC emails to Wikileaks."
25,cyber crime,The_Donald,Can Mueller's Team Be Sued For Assaulting and Degrading Common Law and the Presumption of Innocence? [Op-Ed],13,7milt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7milt2/can_muellers_team_be_sued_for_assaulting_and/,2017-12-28 10:15:11,"--- **Intro and Motivation** Given what we know now in late Dec, 2017, the continuance of the obvious witch hunt of Mueller's ""Special Council"" is now causing harm to the American people, because it's sending a signal to our culture and to our legal system that *""presumption of innocence""* doesn't matter--it is false. Because if a group can do this to the highest position in america--the President of the United States--they can certainly do this same thing to you: ***lawfare***. Dragging out a legal matter, well beyond its intended scope and time frame, causing grievous harm to taxpayers who have to shoulder the burden of the same, while also insulting and accusing not just the lawfully-elected President but all of those who voted for him. In a way, this accusation of election meddling with no evidence to support it--with plenty of evidence to disprove the same--is an attempt not only to reverse a disfavorable political decision by the oppositional team, ...the continuance of the special council in light of the many legal, political conflicts-of-interest of the Special Council team members, and the failure of the MSM or Council to consider counter-evidence that undeniably creates sufficient doubt to stop the investigation, are simply ways to insult, humiliate and infuriate half the country, by assaulting their presumption of innocence, with what could be considered a discriminatory, political assault, whose unreasonable extension can be considered malice, stalking, lawfare, libel, slander, and conspiracy. Is it possible for Mueller's Team to be sued in a class-action lawsuit for assaulting and degrading *common law, specifically the Presumption of Innocence*, or if not, for essentially waging psychological, nonlinear warfare against the American public? Are there any legal scholars out there know the answer to this question? This lawsuit would not be intended to ""stop an investigation"" because it will likely stop itself from having no evidence. This lawsuit would occur after the investigation, as payback for the assault on our way of life. It would be payback for dragging this thing--and the american people--through the mud for over a year. You don't get to do that without accepting the consequences of your action. Someone once said, I think it was John Taylor Gatto: ""Lawsuits are how assholes communicate to each other"", and trust me on this, Mueller needs a stiff talking-to. --- **Presumption of Innocence** From the Wikipedia article on the [Presumption of innocence](URL &gt; Although the Constitution of the United States does not cite it explicitly, presumption of innocence is widely held to follow from the 5th, 6th, and 14th amendments. The case of [Coffin v. United States (1895)](URL established the presumption of innocence of persons accused of crimes. See also [In Re Winship](URL In re Winship is described as follows: &gt; In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970), was a United States Supreme Court decision that held that ""the Due Process clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged.""[1]:17 It established this burden in all cases in all states (constitutional case).[1]:17 The decision did not specify which facts constitute the charged crime ...and Coffin v. United States is elaborated thusly: &gt; The principle that there is a presumption of innocence in favor of the accused is the undoubted law, axiomatic and elementary, and its enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law ... Concluding, then, that the presumption of innocence is evidence in favor of the accused, introduced by the law in his behalf, let us consider what is 'reasonable doubt.' It is, of necessity, the condition of mind produced by the proof resulting from the evidence in the cause. It is the result of the proof, not the proof itself, whereas the presumption of innocence is one of the instruments of proof, going to bring about the proof from which reasonable doubt arises; thus one is a cause, the other an effect. To say that the one is the equivalent of the other is therefore to say that legal evidence can be excluded from the jury, and that such exclusion may be cured by instructing them correctly in regard to the method by which they are required to reach their conclusion upon the proof actually before them; in other words, that the exclusion of an important element of proof can be justified by correctly instructing as to the proof admitted. The evolution of the principle of the presumption of innocence, and its resultant, the doctrine of reasonable doubt, make more apparent the correctness of these views, and indicate the necessity of enforcing the one in order that the other may continue to exist. Given that Russiagate has been [discredited 33 ways from Sunday](URL with evidence ***against*** it growing daily and [supporting these collections of facts](URL over 8 months ago to the present--it is safe to say that ""reasonable doubt""--a qualification for maintaining the presumption of innocence and exoneration of the same crime must be observed.

Those mostly psychopathic pagan actors that are running our government at the highest levels have 'strange bedfellows' including a 40 foot owl and crossdressing/naked orgies in the woods of norther california, or whatever. So I'm going to put this into a language that they uniquely understand.

28,cyber crime,The_Donald,Sometimes you get so fed up you go on a rampage. Long read.,74,7nb8jw,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7nb8jw/sometimes_you_get_so_fed_up_you_go_on_a_rampage/,2018-01-01 08:47:52,"I saw some libs running their mouths on a board I participate on so I had to write this up. Let me know if I missed anything! President Trumps first 11 months. Note, this isnt a copy pasta. This is my own list I just wrote for you. And not to try to defend his accomplishments or him. He doesnt need me for that, hes killing it on his own. Im actually writing this purely out of curiosity. I am genuinely curious if it is possible to break your conditioning. Yes, (you). You are being lied to every day and you accept it. You know it is true but you dont care because you like the warm blanket so you believe the lies. But Ill get more to that at the end. Heres my quick rundown of his first 11 months. Here is the exact list of promises made by then candidate Trump on 10/22/2016 in Gettysburg, PA. Draining the swamp: Promise 1  Term Limits. This one hasnt happened yet because it requires a constitutional amendment. If he manages this Ill be seriously impressed. Promise 2  Freeze all federal hiring. He did this on 1/23/17 with a presidential memorandum. Promise 3  Regulation reform (for every 1 new regulation, 2 old removed). He did this on 1/30/17 with Executive Order 13,771. Hes actually cut something like over 800 regulations now (you can fact check me on this) which is a 22-1 ratio. Promise 4  5 year lobbying ban on administration members. He did this on 1/28/17 with Executive Order 13,770. I would like to see this become law so this extends beyond his administration easier. Not sure if that would require a constitutional amendment. Promise 5  Lifetime ban on foreign lobbying by administration members. He did this on 1/28/17 with EO 13,770 (same as above). Again, I hope this becomes permanent. Foreign Lobbying (FARA) is a HUGE issue with me, personally. As weve seen with Flynn and the Podesta Group, this is where the swamp is deepest and needs to be drained badly. Protecting American Workers: Promise 1  Renegotiate NAFTA. He started this process on 3/31/17 with EO 13,786. This required the Presidents of MEX and CAN to trigger the article. It goes through a series of windows and we are getting close to the end. Hopefully he terminates the deal. Promise 2  Withdraw from TPP. He did this on 1/23/17 with a presidential memorandum. This was probably his most important action as he effectively did it day 1 (Monday first day of work) showing he was going to blitzkrieg his promises. Promise 3  Declare China a currency manipulator. He hasnt done this yet. From what Ive observed, he is holding it as leverage in the ongoing North Korea negotiations. I have also looked into it and from what I understand they have stopped this practice as of his inauguration (feel free to fact check this). Promise 4  End trade abuses. He signed EO 13,785 on 3/28/17 putting Secretary of Trade Ross on this. Hes already gone after CAN and others with respect to dumping certain goods (lumber in particular). Promise 5  Lift US energy restrictions. He did this on 3/28/17 with EO 13,783. Hes cut numerous restrictions and coal mining, exports, oil production, exports, etc. are all way up. Along with Keystone and Dakota and ANWR were about to be (if we arent already) the worlds leading producer and a net exporter of energy. Promise 6  Lift infrastructure regulations. He did this on 1/24/17 with EO 13,766. This has reduced the time it takes to build many things including roads and highways from 10 years to 2 and hopefully soon 1 year. Hopefully with an infrastructure package in 2018 we see tremendous improvement nationwide in our infrastructure. Promise 7  UN climate money redirected to US environmental agencies. He did this in his 2017 budget. Restore Law and Order: Promise 1  Cancel illegal Obama actions. He has done MANY of these. Notably, the DOJ slush fund scam that was totally illegal where the DOJ would fine companies rather than prosecute them but the fines would go to leftist organizations like BLM and Antifa was removed (notice they stopped protesting because they arent getting paychecks anymore). Further, the also illegal and grossly unconstitutional slushfund where Fanny and Freddy profits were diverted from shareholders to support ObamaCare (the president does NOT have the authority to do this) was removed. Promise 2  Select a Supreme Court Justice from a pre-established list of hard line constitutionalists. Justice Gorsuch was confirmed on 4/7/17. Hes also appointed 12 Appellate judges (a record I believe) and a record number of other judges. His first term alone he will completely rebuild the judiciary with constitutionalists. Promise 3  Cut funding to Sanctuary Cities. This was begun on 1/25/17 with EO 13,768. It has been delayed in courts. I actually love our check and balance system and I like that the states are fighting this. Technically it is their citizens money. Should they be forced to adhere to Federal Law to get those grants? Im not a constitution expert but I like seeing the fight play out. What I DONT like seeing is governors blanket pardon criminal aliens and create sanctuary zones for them. Thats not protecting the safety of US Citizens. I like seeing AG Sessions and ICE fight this fight every day. Promise 4  Remove criminal aliens. This was begun on 1/25/17 with EO 13,767. Deportations are way up (Obama actually had a lot already), border crossings are way down, Border Patrol and ICE have been expanded greatly, wall is going up, and MS13 is being decimated (37% increase in deportations from last year). I also love that Dept. of Homeland Security is releasing stats on illegals finally. Youd be shocked at what percent of our prison population arent even supposed to be on our soil. Promise 5  Travel ban and extreme vetting. This was done on 1/27/17 with EO 13,769 and done again with EO 13,780 on 3/6/17. There was also a presidential memorandum on 3/17/17 regarding this. What I again love is that the court system is battling with the DOJ on this. The nature of the ban and conditions have changed through this process. Additionally, a 90 day ban has turned into nearly a 10 month ban. Good job activist judges. Legislative Agenda: Promise 1 - Tax Relief, Simplification, Middle Class Tax Cut of 35%, Small Business tax cut to 15%, overseas funds brought back. This was accomplished just before Christmas. It didnt end up having everything obviously and it didnt remove all the loopholes Id like (even the ones I benefit from). It represents a $3,000/year savings for my family. I actually did the math right away to confirm (yes the news lied to you repeatedly about the nature of this bill, sorry you believed them). Im hoping for round 2 in the future. Promise 2  End the Offshoring Act and establish tariffs. This has yet to be done however the repatriation component of the tax bill and the lower rate should incentivize companies to move back home. Promise 3  US Energy infrastructure Act. Public private partnerships to spur $1 trillion in projects. Keystone, Dakota, ANWR and others done in 2017 are a good start but Im hoping 2018 has major movement here. Our infrastructure is a total joke and we have so much untapped energy. Promise 4  School Choice Education Act to redirect education dollars, end common core, expand school choice, and make college more affordable. The tax bill actually addressed the expansion of school choice through the 529 plans being usable for K-12. I wish the Cruz amendment had further expanded their use to homeschooling because I feel homeschooling is a legitimate option for most families. As an educator in public education I hope he does this whole package ASAP. The public education system and Dept. of education are corrupt and broken. I dont care if I lose my job in the process. My resume is stacked and I can find work elsewhere. Promise 5 - Repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The battle over this bill was within the GOP through much of last year. It didnt pass but thankfully the mandate was repealed which is really all most republicans even care about. You can also buy across state lines now in small groups due to an Executive Order I believe signed in Nov (I need to look this up again). Further, the subsidy payments aka extortion of Fanny and Freddy ended. Look at the news crying for bailouts to the insurance providers. Who are their shareholders and ownership groups? Yeah, screw our insurance companies. The ACA was a giant gift to them. I hope for improvement to healthcare but it wont be done through government planning. We need to totally go free market and see where the chips fall. Promise 6  Child and Eldercare Act allowing the tax deduction of care, incentives for employer care, child care savings accounts, and matching contributions. This is basically Ivankas baby. The child tax credit was doubled and an elder care credit of 600$ was added which is a good start. But more has to be done here because childcare and eldercare is absurdly expensive. Promise 7  End illegal immigration act by funding the border wall (and Mexico will reimburse), 2 year mandatory re-entry jail sentence, 5-year for criminals, and visa reform. Bits and pieces of this have happened. The wall is begun with prototypes up and being tested. First wave of funding was appropriated in the 2017 budget. Sections of fencing are being replaced with a 30+ foot steel see-through fence. The jailing of re-entry violators has been signed I believe. I hope the rest is done in 2018 holding DACA as leverage. Promise 8  Restore Community Safety Act by reducing drug violence, creating a crime task force, and increasing funding for Law Enforcement. This wasnt a bill but much of this has been done actually including a task force on the opiate epidemic. Promise 9  Restore National Security Act by ending the defense sequester, expanding military investment, VA reform, Cyber Security, and extreme vetting. All of this was accomplished through budgets, tax package, executive orders, and presidential memorandums. Those are just his core tenants. If you look at the whole of what hes accomplished in 11 months + his time in transition, heres more: Economy: No, it isnt Obamas economy. The entire left including Obama didnt think Trump could improve the economy. Right now the economy is at 4% growth, unemployment is just about 4%, all confidence levels are at records, home prices and buying are up, and the stock market is up 5,000 points. This isnt about Obama. This is about Trump making deals (the list is LONG, over a trillion in deals 1 on 1 with nations like Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Singapore, and others), cutting regulation, etc. Furthermore, I greatly approve of the Fed having increased rates 3 times this year. Something never done under Obama. I hope the rates continue to go up because it is good for the long term health of our country. Perhaps most importantly, black and Hispanic unemployment are WAY down. Foreign Policy: The news is straight up lying to you. America is respected like never before. Trump rolled into the Middle East as his first item of business and now you see Saudi Arabia letting women drive, cracking down on terrorism, and a full coup of Al-Waleed and the Bin Laden family. This is literally a new era in the Middle East and nobody even gets it. Further, he ended the terrible Iran deal, our allies in NATO have stepped up their contributions by over 40billion a year, ISIS has lost over 99% of its territory in Iraq and Syria. I mean seriously guys, he defeated ISIS. We finally won a fucking war. And the media wont report on it. What a joke. As a last item, he allowed the military to define victory and an exit trajectory in Afghanistan and they are now working towards that goal. I hope we can leave that country better than we found it after these last 16 years (longest in US history). Lastly, NK has been totally isolated. China and Russia actually voted with us (never happened before) in the UN and NK is now reaching out to Trump to try to make a deal. Thanks a lot to our last 3 administrations for allowing that murderous regime to acquire nukes and ICBMs btw. Hes also cutting funding to the UN, cutting aid to foreign countries like Pakistan, and reversing our failed policy with Cuba. All good things. Law and Order: In case youve missed it, Human Trafficking has been a priority for this administration which is something Im incredibly happy about. Im curious to see the final numbers for 2017 because the predictions are a 5 fold increase in human trafficking arrests over last year. MS13 in particular is being rounded up and removed. Illegal border crossings are way down. I hope to see something finally done about violence in the 10 worst US cities which are responsible for the vast majority of all gun violence and homicides in the United States. Military: VA reform was huge. You probably missed it but he managed to combine the VA and DOD electronic systems (something thats been undoable for 3 decades) and has expanded choice for VA patients so they can use outside care. He improved defense spending and our military is on pace to be more ready than ever. Many useless bases are being closed down and the military is finally being taken off the leashes put on it by congressional misappropriation (ie. buying tanks they dont want or need). Culture: Hes fighting a culture war and I love it. His use of social media is a direct assault on the mainstream leftist narrative they run through the media, Hollywood, and education. I love that it drives the left crazy. I love that he celebrates Christmas, invokes the name of God, reads scripture, and has prayer sessions every day in the white house. I love that he denounces Communism and Socialism and makes a point to talk about STRONG SOVERIEGN NATION STATES. Hes turned our entire culture around and the left is freaking out bad. Hollywood has had its worst year in decades, the NFL is floundering, and the Democrats have no message. Keep the hits coming. Make America Great Again and make our values matter again. Phew! Im sure there is more but its been a hell of a year and Im tired so Ill conclude with: As a note, I kept a website going but I actually became overwhelmed after about 6 months and stopped updating. So I had to research a bit more to put this together. Of note, here are the things I am not happy about. 1. I think Asset Forfeiture is unconstitutional and I want to see it made illegal. 2. I think the Drug War is a failed policy that I want to see addressed, revamped, or ended. 3. I think the War in Afghanistan should be ended ASAP. I dislike foreign military intervention. 4. I actually think he should tweet about 50% more. Yes, Im serious on this one. 5. I am not tired of winning. He said I would be. (Sorry I had to!) As for your conditioning. Arent you sick of it? Arent you sick of being told Trump has 1% chance to get the nomination? 3% chance to get elected? No path to 270? No way hell get tax cuts through? No way hell survive his first term? No way hell escape impeachment? Arent you sick of the fucking BULLSHIT? WAKE UP. The news media is TOTAL BULLSHIT. Once you realize that and realize how long they have lied straight to your face about literally everything, things will finally start to make some sort of sense. Do I sound angry? Yes because I am angry. Here you are, claiming to be part of some resistance. Well what are you resisting? A democratically elected president? Sound economic, law enforcement, and foreign policy? Your allies are who? THE ENTIRE ESTABLISHMENT? Establishment democrats and republicans, the media, Hollywood, TV and movies, video games and comedians? Wikipedia, Google, Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook?? Everybody is on YOUR side, yet you are resisting? Give me a break. Youre useful idiots. You need to slap yourself and realize you are no different than the citizens of Germany or the USSR. The powers that be dont care about you. The entire loud speaker of the power structure tells you what to be outraged about and you cry into the sky like a bunch of damn lemmings. It disgusts me every day. ADDENDUM: This last year has been incredible and has moved so fast so as I think up more victories over the last 11 months I will put them down here. Exited the Paris Climate Accord, signed more legislation than almost any president in history in the first months (over 53 bills), met with over 115 heads of state, denounced and sanctioned the failed socialist regime in Venezuela, expanded public-private internship program opportunities, over 2 million new jobs created, federal government workforce decreased (11,000 jobs reduced), Department of State greatly shrunk, EPA greatly shrunk, government worker raise slated for year end 2017 greatly reduced, redefined NASAs mission and put us on a path to another moon landing and Mars (hopefully!), publicly supported the current uprising in Iran, signed a sweeping executive order that targets the assets and people involved in world wide human trafficking and corruption rings, created a task force on election integrity, created a dept of american innovation in the federal government to identify ways to modernize and save money across departments and agencies including cyber security measures, made it so pipelines built in the US have to use US steel and labor, reinstate Mexico City policy (aka stop spending US tax payer dollars on foreign abortions), gave US troops first raise in 7 years, removed Climate Change as a security threat, moving our Embassy to Jerusalem, pulled out of UN migrant pact, ended CIA funding of Syrian Rebels AKA Al Queda, expanded school choice Dept of Education grants, withdrew from UNESCO, signed over 46 executive orders, saved over $200 billion by slashing regulations, cut the White House budget and staff, DONATED HIS SALARY, divested all his stocks before winning the election, gave all his businesses in a trust to his kids so he has no conflicts of interest, initiative to modernize air traffic control, rolling back Dodd-Frank (hopefully put Glass-Steagall back in place), new Federal Reserve Chair, ended FED era of quantitative easing and began selling back the assets purchased under the Obama era FED program to stabilize the economy, mining up 30%, companies no longer have to give up intellectual property to operate in China, US individuals can now own ownership stakes (over 51%) in Chinese corporations, Broadcom returning to US, handled multiple major US disasters including 4 cat 3+ hurricane landfalls smoothly, labor participation back over 63% (needs to go higher), wages UP, median income up (first time since 2007), food stamp usage down, wages rising faster than prices, inflation still below target 2%, trade gap closing, black unemployment is at lowest level in 17 years, hispanic unemployment lowest on record, gas prices 12 year low, government spending, deficit, and debt as a % of GDP down, coal exports up 60%, access to VA programs up, VA wait times down, DOD audit (first ever) begins, appointed Mick Mulvaney to be director of the CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) aka the most illegal, unaccountable, and unconstitutional agency ever created (I hope Mick audits this thing and shuts it down after exposing all its abuses), elevated US Cyber Command to its own command (this is actually very underrated and a very important move), pardoned Sheriff Joe, ended Net Neutrality, has multiple cabinet and White House staff members who divested and/or take no or reduced salaries, released the JFK files, ended Dept of Education Title IX (kangaroo courts), saved countless lives by sharing intel with Russia regarding terrorist plans to attack St. Petersburg and use laptops to crash airplanes, first president to be invited to visit China's Forbidden Palace, first president to visit the Western Wall, government initiative to prioritize buying American, rebuilt American optimism and the American Brand (brands have values folks and our brand is the best brand), established Aluminum, Steel, Rare Earths and other essential materials to security as priorities to secure, Obama era federal land grab in Utah repealed, negotiated down the price of the F35 and Air Force One, Initiated a new Israel-Palestine peace agreement and the Saudis have now told the Palestinians that they will follow through or be defunded, started the process to upgrade our nuclear readiness, visited 15 different nations, secured the release of US citizens held in Pakistan, Egypt, North Korea, and China..."
29,cyber crime,The_Donald,Wew Lads! What a year 2017 has been! I made a list of everything we have accomplished! ENJOY!,32,7ncn46,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7ncn46/wew_lads_what_a_year_2017_has_been_i_made_a_list/,2018-01-01 13:16:47,"Hey all! Corruption is Treason here. You might remember me from the website I made URL I had to get busy in real life but Ive still been on the ride as much as possible. What a year! I wrote this earlier today after doing a lot of introspection the last two days and in response to some negativity I saw on another message board. I am editing it further and reposting it to raise awareness to the awesome job President Trump is doing. Feel free to respond with anything I have missed. Share it or use it to spread the word. Enjoy! Happy New Year!! I hope 2018 is even GREATER! President Trumps first 11 months. Note, this isnt a copy pasta. This is my own list I wrote just for you. Im not trying to defend President Trumps accomplishments or him. He doesnt need me for that - hes killing it on his own. Im actually writing this purely out of curiosity. I am genuinely curious if it is possible to break your conditioning. Yes, (you). You are being lied to every day and you accept it. You know it is true but you dont care because you like the warm blanket so you believe the lies. But Ill get more to that at the end. Heres my quick rundown of his first 11 months as President of the United States of America. Here is the exact list of promises made by then candidate Trump on 10/22/2016 in Gettysburg, PA. Draining the swamp: Promise 1  Term Limits. This one hasnt happened yet because it requires a constitutional amendment. If he manages this Ill be seriously impressed. Promise 2  Freeze all federal hiring. He did this on 1/23/17 with a presidential memorandum. Promise 3  Regulation reform (for every 1 new regulation, 2 old removed). He did this on 1/30/17 with Executive Order 13,771. Hes actually cut over 800 regulations which is a 1-22 ratio. Over 700 more regulations are slated to be ended in 2018. Promise 4  5 year lobbying ban on former administration members. He did this on 1/28/17 with Executive Order 13,770. I would like to see this become law so this extends beyond his administration easier. Not sure if that would require a constitutional amendment. Promise 5  Lifetime ban on foreign lobbying by former administration members. He did this on 1/28/17 with EO 13,770 (same as above). Again, I hope this becomes permanent. Foreign Lobbying (FARA) and lobbying in general is a HUGE issue with me, personally. This is where the swamp is deepest and needs to be drained badly. Preventing the revolving door of government to corporation and back is paramount to protecting our institutions. Protecting American Workers: Promise 1  Renegotiate NAFTA. He started this process on 3/31/17 with EO 13,786. This required the Presidents of MEX and CAN to trigger the article (which has happened). It goes through a series of windows and we are getting close to the end. Hopefully he terminates the deal in early 2018. Promise 2  Withdraw from TPP. He did this on 1/23/17 with a presidential memorandum. This was probably his most important action as he effectively did it day 1 (Monday first day of work) showing he was going to blitzkrieg his promises. Promise 3  Declare China a currency manipulator. He hasnt done this yet. From what Ive observed, he is holding it as leverage in the ongoing North Korea negotiations. I have also looked into it and from what I understand they have stopped this practice (as of his inauguration). Promise 4  End trade abuses. He signed EO 13,785 on 3/28/17 putting Secretary of Trade Ross on this. Hes already gone after CAN and others with respect to dumping certain goods (lumber in particular). He has also ended the forced technology transfer to China. Promise 5  Lift US energy restrictions. He did this on 3/28/17 with EO 13,783. Hes cut numerous restrictions. Coal mining/exports, oil production/exports, etc. are all way up. Along with Keystone, Dakota, and ANWR were about to be (if we arent already) the worlds leading producer, and a net exporter, of energy. This action is vital for our economic and national security. Promise 6  Lift infrastructure regulations. He did this on 1/24/17 with EO 13,766. This has reduced the time it takes to approve many projects including roads and highways from 10 years to 2 and hopefully soon less than 1 year. Hopefully with an infrastructure package in 2018 we see tremendous improvement nationwide in our infrastructure. Promise 7  UN climate money redirected to US environmental agencies. He did this in his 2017 budget. Restore Law and Order: Promise 1  Cancel illegal Obama actions. He has done MANY of these. Notably, the $3billion+ DOJ slush fund scam that was totally illegal where the DOJ would fine companies rather than prosecute them (ex. Volkswagen) but the fines would go to leftist organizations like BLM and Antifa was removed (notice they stopped protesting because they arent getting paychecks anymore). Further, the also illegal and grossly unconstitutional slush fund where Fanny and Freddy profits were diverted from shareholders to support ObamaCare (the president does NOT have the authority to do this) was removed. Promise 2  Select a Supreme Court Justice from a pre-established list of hard line constitutionalists. Justice Gorsuch was confirmed on 4/7/17. Hes also appointed 12 Appellate judges (a record I believe) and a record number of other lifetime federal judges. His first term alone will completely rebuild the judiciary with constitutionalists. Promise 3  Cut funding to Sanctuary Cities. This was begun on 1/25/17 with EO 13,768. It has been delayed in courts. I actually love our check and balance system and I like that the states are fighting this. Technically it is their citizens money. Should they be forced to adhere to Federal Law to get those grants? Im not a constitution expert but I like seeing the fight play out. What I DONT like seeing is governors blanket pardon criminal aliens and create sanctuary zones for them. Thats not protecting the safety of US Citizens. I like seeing AG Sessions and ICE fight this fight every day. Promise 4  Remove criminal aliens. This was begun on 1/25/17 with EO 13,767. Deportations are way up (Obama actually had a lot already), border crossings are way down, Border Patrol and ICE have been expanded greatly, the wall is going up, and MS13 is being decimated (37% increase in deportations from last year). I also love that Dept. of Homeland Security is releasing stats on illegals finally. Youd be shocked at the percent of our prison population arent even supposed to be on our soil. Promise 5  Travel ban and extreme vetting. This was done on 1/27/17 with EO 13,769 and done again with EO 13,780 on 3/6/17. There was also a presidential memorandum on 3/17/17 regarding this. What I again love is that the court system is battling with the DOJ on this. The nature of the ban and conditions have changed through this process. Additionally, a 90 day ban has turned into nearly a 10 month ban. Good job activist judges. Legislative Agenda: Promise 1 - Tax Relief, Simplification, Middle Class Tax Cut of 35%, Small Business tax cut to 15%, overseas funds brought back. This was accomplished just before Christmas. It didnt end up having everything obviously and it didnt remove all the loopholes Id like (even the ones I benefit from). It represents a $3,000/year savings for my family. I actually did the math right away to confirm (yes the news lied to you repeatedly about the nature of this bill, sorry you believed them). Im hoping for round two in the future that includes more reform and reductions. Promise 2  End the Offshoring Act and establish tariffs. This has yet to be done however the repatriation component of the tax bill and the lower rate should incentivize companies to move back home. Promise 3  US Energy infrastructure Act. Public private partnerships to spur $1 trillion in projects. Keystone, Dakota, ANWR, and others done in 2017 are a good start but Im hoping 2018 has major movement here. Our infrastructure is a total joke and we have so much untapped energy. Promise 4  School Choice Education Act to redirect education dollars, end common core, expand school choice, and make college more affordable. The tax bill actually addressed the expansion of school choice through the 529 plans being usable for K-12. I wish the Cruz amendment had further expanded their use to homeschooling because I feel homeschooling is a legitimate option for many families. As an educator in public education I hope he does this whole package ASAP. The public education system and Dept. of Education are corrupt and broken. I dont care if I lose my job in the process. My resume is stacked and I can find work elsewhere. Promise 5 - Repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The battle over this bill was within the GOP through much of last year. It didnt pass but thankfully the mandate was repealed which is really all most Trump supporters even care about. You can also buy across state lines now in small groups due to Executive Order 13,813. Further, the subsidy payments aka extortion of Fanny and Freddy ended. Look at the news crying for bailouts to the insurance providers. Who are their shareholders and ownership groups? Yeah, screw our insurance companies. The ACA was a giant gift to them. I hope for improvement to healthcare but it wont be done through government planning. We need to go free market and see where the chips fall. Promise 6  Child and Eldercare Act allowing the tax deduction of care, incentives for employer care, child care savings accounts, and matching contributions. This is basically Ivankas baby. The child tax credit was doubled and an elder care credit of 600$ was added which is a good start. But more has to be done here because childcare and eldercare is absurdly expensive. Promise 7  End illegal immigration act by funding the border wall (and Mexico will reimburse), 2 year mandatory re-entry jail sentence, 5-year for criminals, and visa reform. Bits and pieces of this have happened. The wall is begun with prototypes up and being tested. First wave of funding was appropriated in the 2017 budget. Sections of fencing are being replaced with a 30+ foot steel see-through fence. The jailing of re-entry violators has been signed I believe. I hope the rest is done in 2018 holding DACA as leverage. Promise 8  Restore Community Safety Act by reducing drug violence, creating a crime task force, and increasing funding for Law Enforcement. This wasnt a bill but virtually all of this has been done including a task force on the opiate epidemic. Promise 9  Restore National Security Act by ending the defense sequester, expanding military investment, VA reform, Cyber Security, and extreme vetting. All of this was accomplished through budgets, tax package, executive orders, and presidential memorandums. Those are just his core tenants. If you look at the whole of what hes accomplished in 11 months + his time in transition, here is more subdivided into broad categories and not in any particular order. Economy: No, it isnt Obamas economy. The entire left including Obama didnt think Trump could improve the economy. Right now the economy is at 4% growth, unemployment is just about 4%, all confidence levels are at records, home prices and buying are up, and the stock market is up 5,000 points. This isnt about Obama. This is about Trump making deals (the list is LONG, over a trillion in deals 1 on 1 with nations like Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Singapore, and others), cutting regulation, etc. Furthermore, I greatly approve of the Fed having increased rates 3 times this year. Something never done under Obama. I hope the rates continue to go up because it is good for the long term health of our country. Perhaps most importantly, Black and Hispanic unemployment are WAY down. Here are some quick notables on the economic front accomplished in 2017: rebuilt American optimism and the American Brand (brands have values folks and our brand is the best brand); exited the Paris Climate Accord; government initiative to prioritize buying American; expanded public-private internship program opportunities, over 2 million new jobs created; saved over $200 billion by slashing over 800 regulations (700 more on the chopping block); rolling back Dodd-Frank (hopefully putting Glass-Steagall back in place); appointed new Federal Reserve Chair; ended FED era of quantitative easing and began selling back the assets purchased under the Obama era FED program to stabilize the economy; made it so pipelines built in the US have to use US steel and labor; mining up 30%; companies no longer have to give up intellectual property to operate in China; US individuals can now own ownership stakes (over 51%) in Chinese corporations; Broadcom returning to US; labor participation back over 63% (needs to go higher); wages UP; median income up (first time since 2007); food stamp usage down; wages rising faster than prices; inflation still below target 2%; trade gap closing; Black unemployment is at lowest level in 17 years; Hispanic unemployment lowest on record; gas prices at 12 year low; government spending, deficit, and debt as a % of GDP down; and coal exports up 60%. Foreign Policy: The news is straight up lying to you. America is respected like never before. Trump rolled into the Middle East as his first item of business and now you see Saudi Arabia letting women drive and enter the workforce, they are cracking down on terrorism, and they have conducted a full coup of Al-Waleed and the Bin Laden family. This is literally a new era in the Middle East and nobody even gets it. Further, he ended the terrible Iran deal, our allies in NATO have stepped up their contributions by over 40billion a year, ISIS has lost over 99% of its territory in Iraq and Syria. I mean seriously guys, he defeated ISIS. We finally won a fucking war. And the media wont report on it. What a joke. He allowed the military to define victory and an exit trajectory in Afghanistan and they are now working towards that goal. I hope we can leave that country better than we found it after these last 16 years (longest war in US history). Lastly, NK has been totally isolated. China and Russia actually voted with us (never happened before) in the UN and NK is now reaching out to Trump to try to make a deal. Thanks a lot to our last three administrations for allowing that murderous regime to acquire nukes and ICBMs, btw. That was just the major items, however, heres the rest of 2017: cut funding to the UN; cut aid to countries like Pakistan; reversed Obamas failed policy with Cuba; secured the release of US citizens held in Pakistan, Egypt, North Korea, and China; ended CIA funding of Syrian Rebels (Al Qaeda); denounced and sanctioned the failed socialist regime in Venezuela; publicly supported the current uprising in Iran; met with over 115 heads of state; visited 15 different nations; reinstated the Mexico City policy (aka stopped spending US tax payer dollars on foreign abortions); pulled out of the UN migrant pact; withdrew from UNESCO; moving our Embassy to Jerusalem; saved countless lives by sharing intel with Russia regarding terrorist plans to attack St. Petersburg and use laptops to crash airplanes; first president to be invited to visit China's Forbidden Palace; first president to visit the Western Wall; and Initiated a new Israel-Palestine peace agreement (the Saudis have now told the Palestinians that they will follow through or be defunded). Military: VA reform was huge. You probably missed it but he managed to combine the VA and DOD electronic systems (something thats been undoable for 3 decades), has expanded choice for VA patients so they can use outside care, and has finally brought accountability to the VA so bad employees can be fired. He increased defense spending and our military is on pace to be more ready than ever. Many useless bases are being closed down and the military is finally being taken off the leashes put on it by congressional misappropriation (ie. buying tanks they dont want or need). Other notable military achievements and actions of 2017 include: gave US troops first raise in 7 years; access to VA programs up; VA wait times down; DOD audit (first ever) begun; negotiated down the price of the F35 and Air Force One; initiated a review and upgrade to our nuclear readiness; elevated US Cyber Command to its own command (this is actually very underrated and a very important move); established Aluminum, Steel, Rare Earths and other essential materials to national security as priorities to secure; and removed Climate Change as a security threat. Law, Order, and Draining the Swamp: In case youve missed it, Human Trafficking has been a priority for this administration which is something Im incredibly happy about. Im curious to see the final numbers for 2017 because the predictions are a 5 fold increase in human trafficking arrests over last year. MS13 in particular is being rounded up and removed. Illegal border crossings are way down. I hope to see something finally done about violence in the 10 worst US cities which are responsible for the vast majority of all gun violence and homicides in the United States (despite the fact that they are run by democrats and have some of the strictest gun control policies). To end corruption in the bureaucracy, President Trump also took the following actions in 2017: federal government workforce decreased (11,000 jobs reduced); Department of State greatly shrunk; EPA greatly shrunk; government worker raise slated for year end 2017 greatly reduced; redefined NASAs mission and put us on a path to another moon landing and Mars (hopefully!); signed a sweeping executive order that targets the assets and people involved in worldwide human trafficking and corruption rings; created a task force on election integrity; expanded school choice Dept of Education grants; cut the White House budget and staff; DONATED HIS SALARY to the national park service, a STEM camp for girls, and the opioid epidemic taskforce; divested all his stocks before winning the election; gave all his businesses in a trust to his kids so he has no conflicts of interest; appointed Mick Mulvaney to be director of the CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) aka the most illegal, unaccountable, and unconstitutional agency ever created (I hope Mick audits this thing and shuts it down after exposing all its abuses); ended Net Neutrality; pardoned Sheriff Joe; has multiple cabinet and White House staff members who divested and/or take no or reduced salaries; released the JFK files; ended Dept of Education Title IX (kangaroo courts); and repealed the Obama era federal land grab in Utah. Leadership and Culture: President Trump has signed more legislation than almost any president in history in the first months (over 53 bills) in addition to signing over 46 executive orders. Hes also looking to modernize our government. He created the Department of American Innovation to identify ways to modernize and save money across departments and agencies including cyber security measures. He has established a task force to modernize air traffic control. Perhaps most importantly, he led at home by providing support  financial, logistical, and emotional  through a brutal hurricane season and numerous other disasters. Hes fighting a culture war and I love it. His use of social media is a direct assault on the mainstream leftist narrative they run through the media, Hollywood, and education. I love that it drives the left crazy. I love that he loudly celebrates Christmas, invokes the name of God, reads scripture, and has prayer sessions every day in the White House. I love that he denounces Communism, Socialism, and Globalism and makes a point to talk about STRONG SOVERIEGN NATION STATES. Hes turned our entire culture around and the left is freaking out bigly. Hollywood has had its worst year in decades, the NFL is floundering, and the Democrats have no message. Keep the hits coming! Make America Great Again and make our values matter again! Phew! Im sure there is more but its been a hell of a year and Im tired so Ill conclude with: Here are the things I am not happy about: 1. I think Asset Forfeiture is unconstitutional and I want to see it made illegal. 2. I think the Drug War is a failed policy that I want to see addressed, revamped, or ended. 3. I think the War in Afghanistan should be ended ASAP. I dislike foreign military intervention. 4. I actually think he should tweet about 50% more. Yes, Im serious on this one. 5. I am not tired of winning. He said I would be. (Sorry I had to!) As for your conditioning. Arent you sick of it? Arent you sick of being told Trump has 1% chance to get the nomination? 3% chance to get elected? No path to 270? No way hell get tax cuts through? No way hell survive his first term?

This was probably his most important action as he effectively did it day 1 (Monday first day of work) showing he was going to blitzkrieg his promises. - Promise 3  Declare China a currency manipulator. He hasnt done this yet. From what Ive observed, he is holding it as leverage in the ongoing North Korea negotiations. I have also looked into it and from what I understand they have stopped this practice (as of his inauguration). - Promise 4  End trade abuses. He signed EO 13,785 on 3/28/17 putting Secretary of Trade Ross on this. Hes already gone after CAN and others with respect to dumping certain goods (lumber in particular). He has also ended the forced technology transfer to China. - Promise 5  Lift US energy restrictions. He did this on 3/28/17 with EO 13,783. Hes cut numerous restrictions. Coal mining/exports, oil production/exports, etc. are all way up. Along with Keystone, Dakota, and ANWR were about to be (if we arent already) the worlds leading producer, and a net exporter, of energy. This action is vital for our economic and national security. - Promise 6  Lift infrastructure regulations. He did this on 1/24/17 with EO 13,766. This has reduced the time it takes to approve many projects including roads and highways from 10 years to 2 and hopefully soon less than 1 year. Hopefully with an infrastructure package in 2018 we see tremendous improvement nationwide in our infrastructure. - Promise 7  UN climate money redirected to US environmental agencies. He did this in his 2017 budget. Restore Law and Order: - Promise 1  Cancel illegal Obama actions. He has done MANY of these. Notably, the $3billion+ DOJ slush fund scam that was totally illegal where the DOJ would fine companies rather than prosecute them (ex. Volkswagen) but the fines would go to leftist organizations like BLM and Antifa was removed (notice they stopped protesting because they arent getting paychecks anymore). Further, the also illegal and grossly unconstitutional slush fund where Fanny and Freddy profits were diverted from shareholders to support ObamaCare (the president does NOT have the authority to do this) was removed. - Promise 2  Select a Supreme Court Justice from a pre-established list of hard line constitutionalists. Justice Gorsuch was confirmed on 4/7/17. Hes also appointed 12 Appellate judges (a record I believe) and a record number of other lifetime federal judges. His first term alone will completely rebuild the judiciary with constitutionalists. - Promise 3  Cut funding to Sanctuary Cities. This was begun on 1/25/17 with EO 13,768. It has been delayed in courts. I actually love our check and balance system and I like that the states are fighting this. Technically it is their citizens money. Should they be forced to adhere to Federal Law to get those grants? Im not a constitution expert but I like seeing the fight play out. What I DONT like seeing is governors blanket pardon criminal aliens and create sanctuary zones for them. Thats not protecting the safety of US Citizens. I like seeing AG Sessions and ICE fight this fight every day. - Promise 4  Remove criminal aliens. This was begun on 1/25/17 with EO 13,767. Deportations are way up (Obama actually had a lot already), border crossings are way down, Border Patrol and ICE have been expanded greatly, the wall is going up, and MS13 is being decimated (37% increase in deportations from last year). I also love that Dept. of Homeland Security is releasing stats on illegals finally. Youd be shocked at the percent of our prison population arent even supposed to be on our soil. - Promise 5  Travel ban and extreme vetting. This was done on 1/27/17 with EO 13,769 and done again with EO 13,780 on 3/6/17. There was also a presidential memorandum on 3/17/17 regarding this. What I again love is that the court system is battling with the DOJ on this. The nature of the ban and conditions have changed through this process. Additionally, a 90 day ban has turned into nearly a 10 month ban. Good job activist judges. Legislative Agenda: - Promise 1 - Tax Relief, Simplification, Middle Class Tax Cut of 35%, Small Business tax cut to 15%, overseas funds brought back. This was accomplished just before Christmas. It didnt end up having everything obviously and it didnt remove all the loopholes Id like (even the ones I benefit from). It represents a $3,000/year savings for my family. I actually did the math right away to confirm (yes the news lied to you repeatedly about the nature of this bill, sorry you believed them). Im hoping for round two in the future that includes more reform and reductions. - Promise 2  End the Offshoring Act and establish tariffs. This has yet to be done however the repatriation component of the tax bill and the lower rate should incentivize companies to move back home. - Promise 3  US Energy infrastructure Act. Public private partnerships to spur $1 trillion in projects. Keystone, Dakota, ANWR, and others done in 2017 are a good start but Im hoping 2018 has major movement here. Our infrastructure is a total joke and we have so much untapped energy. - Promise 4  School Choice Education Act to redirect education dollars, end common core, expand school choice, and make college more affordable. The tax bill actually addressed the expansion of school choice through the 529 plans being usable for K-12. I wish the Cruz amendment had further expanded their use to homeschooling because I feel homeschooling is a legitimate option for many families. As an educator in public education I hope he does this whole package ASAP. The public education system and Dept. of Education are corrupt and broken. I dont care if I lose my job in the process. My resume is stacked and I can find work elsewhere. - Promise 5 - Repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The battle over this bill was within the GOP through much of last year. It didnt pass but thankfully the mandate was repealed which is really all most Trump supporters even care about. You can also buy across state lines now in small groups due to Executive Order 13,813. Further, the subsidy payments aka extortion of Fanny and Freddy ended. Look at the news crying for bailouts to the insurance providers. Who are their shareholders and ownership groups? Yeah, screw our insurance companies. The ACA was a giant gift to them. I hope for improvement to healthcare but it wont be done through government planning. We need to go free market and see where the chips fall. - Promise 6  Child and Eldercare Act allowing the tax deduction of care, incentives for employer care, child care savings accounts, and matching contributions. This is basically Ivankas baby. The child tax credit was doubled and an elder care credit of 600$ was added which is a good start. But more has to be done here because childcare and eldercare is absurdly expensive. - Promise 7  End illegal immigration act by funding the border wall (and Mexico will reimburse), 2 year mandatory re-entry jail sentence, 5-year for criminals, and visa reform. Bits and pieces of this have happened. The wall is begun with prototypes up and being tested. First wave of funding was appropriated in the 2017 budget. Sections of fencing are being replaced with a 30+ foot steel see-through fence. The jailing of re-entry violators has been signed I believe. I hope the rest is done in 2018 holding DACA as leverage. - Promise 8  Restore Community Safety Act by reducing drug violence, creating a crime task force, and increasing funding for Law Enforcement. This wasnt a bill but virtually all of this has been done including a task force on the opiate epidemic. - Promise 9  Restore National Security Act by ending the defense sequester, expanding military investment, VA reform, Cyber Security, and extreme vetting. All of this was accomplished through budgets, tax package, executive orders, and presidential memorandums. Those are just his core tenants. If you look at the whole of what hes accomplished in 11 months + his time in transition, here is more subdivided into broad categories and not in any particular order. - Economy: No, this isnt Obamas economy. It ceased being Obama's economy on Nov. 9th, 2016. The markets spoke and they spoke clearly. The entire left including Obama didnt think Trump could improve the economy. Right now the economy is at 4% growth, unemployment is just about 4%, all confidence levels are at records, home prices and buying are up, and the stock market is up 5,000 points. This isnt about Obama. This is about Trump making deals (the list is LONG, over a trillion in deals 1 on 1 with nations like Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Singapore, and others), cutting regulation, etc. Furthermore, I greatly approve of the Fed having increased rates 3 times this year. Something never done under Obama. I hope the rates continue to go up because it is good for the long term health of our country. Perhaps most importantly, Black and Hispanic unemployment are WAY down. Here are some quick notables on the economic front accomplished in 2017: rebuilt American optimism and the American Brand (brands have values folks and our brand is the best brand); exited the Paris Climate Accord; government initiative to prioritize buying American; expanded public-private internship program opportunities, over 2 million new jobs created; saved over $200 billion by slashing over 800 regulations (700 more on the chopping block); rolling back Dodd-Frank (hopefully putting Glass-Steagall back in place); appointed new Federal Reserve Chair; the FED began selling back the $4.5+trillion in assets purchased under the Obama era FED program of ""quantitative easing"" to stabilize the economy; made it so pipelines built in the US have to use US steel and labor; mining up 30%; companies no longer have to give up intellectual property to operate in China; US individuals can now own ownership stakes (over 51%) in Chinese corporations; Broadcom returning to US; labor participation back over 63% (needs to go higher); wages UP; median income up (first time since 2007); food stamp usage down; wages rising faster than prices; inflation still below target 2%; trade gap closing; Black unemployment is at lowest level in 17 years; Hispanic unemployment lowest on record; gas prices at 12 year low; government spending, deficit, and debt as a % of GDP down; and coal exports up 60%. - Foreign Policy: The news is straight up lying to you. America is respected like never before. Trump rolled into the Middle East as his first item of business and now you see Saudi Arabia letting women drive and enter the workforce, they are cracking down on terrorism, and they have conducted a full coup of Al-Waleed and the Bin Laden family. This is a new era in the Middle East and nobody even gets it. Further, he decertified the terrible Iran deal, our allies in NATO have stepped up their contributions by over 40billion a year, ISIS has lost over 99% of its territory in Iraq and Syria. I mean seriously guys, he defeated ISIS. We finally won a fucking war. And the media wont report on it. What a joke. He allowed the military to define victory and an exit trajectory in Afghanistan and they are now working towards that goal. I hope we can leave that country better than we found it after these last 16 years (longest war in US history). Lastly, NK has been totally isolated. China and Russia actually voted with us (never happened before) in the UN and NK is now reaching out to Trump to try to make a deal. Thanks a lot to our last three administrations for allowing that murderous regime to acquire nukes and ICBMs, btw. That was just the major items, however, heres the rest of 2017: cut funding to the UN; cut aid to countries like Pakistan; reversed Obamas failed policy with Cuba; secured the release of US citizens held in Pakistan, Egypt, North Korea, and China; ended CIA funding of Syrian Rebels (Al Qaeda); denounced and sanctioned the failed socialist regime in Venezuela; publicly supported the current uprising in Iran; met with over 115 heads of state; visited 15 different nations; reinstated the Mexico City policy (aka stopped spending US tax payer dollars on foreign abortions); pulled out of the UN migrant pact; withdrew from UNESCO; moving our Embassy to Jerusalem; saved countless lives by sharing intel with Russia regarding terrorist plans to attack St. Petersburg and use laptops to crash airplanes; first president to be invited to visit China's Forbidden Palace; first president to visit the Western Wall; and Initiated a new Israel-Palestine peace agreement (the Saudis have now told the Palestinians that they will follow through or be defunded). - Military: VA reform was huge. You probably missed it but he managed to combine the VA and DOD electronic systems (something thats been undoable for 3 decades), has expanded choice for VA patients so they can use outside care, and has finally brought accountability to the VA so bad employees can be fired. He increased defense spending and our military is on pace to be more ready than ever. Many useless bases are being closed down and the military is finally being taken off the leashes put on it by congressional misappropriation (ie. buying tanks they dont want or need). Other notable military achievements and actions of 2017 include: gave US troops first raise in 7 years; access to VA programs up; VA wait times down; DOD audit (first ever) begun; negotiated down the price of the F35 and Air Force One; initiated a review and upgrade to our nuclear readiness; elevated US Cyber Command to its own command (this is actually very underrated and a very important move); established Aluminum, Steel, Rare Earths and other essential materials to national security as priorities to secure; and removed Climate Change as a security threat. - Law, Order, and Draining the Swamp: In case youve missed it, Human Trafficking has been a priority for this administration which is something Im incredibly happy about. Im curious to see the final numbers for 2017 because the predictions are a 5 fold increase in human trafficking arrests over last year. MS13 in particular is being rounded up and removed. Illegal border crossings are way down. I hope to see something finally done about violence in the 10 worst US cities which are responsible for the vast majority of all gun violence and homicides in the United States (despite the fact that they are run by democrats and have some of the strictest gun control policies). To end corruption in the bureaucracy, President Trump also took the following actions in 2017: federal government workforce decreased (11,000 jobs reduced); Department of State greatly shrunk; EPA greatly shrunk; government worker raise slated for year end 2017 greatly reduced; redefined NASAs mission and put us on a path to another moon landing and Mars (hopefully!); signed a sweeping executive order that targets the assets and people involved in worldwide human trafficking and corruption rings; created a task force on election integrity; expanded school choice Dept of Education grants; cut the White House budget and staff; DONATED HIS SALARY to the national park service, a STEM camp for girls, and the opioid epidemic taskforce; divested all his stocks before winning the election; gave all his businesses in a trust to his kids so he has no conflicts of interest; appointed Mick Mulvaney to be director of the CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) aka the most illegal, unaccountable, and unconstitutional agency ever created (I hope Mick audits this thing and shuts it down after exposing all its abuses); ended Net Neutrality; pardoned Sheriff Joe; has multiple cabinet and White House staff members who divested and/or take no or reduced salaries; released the JFK files; ended Dept of Education Title IX (kangaroo courts); and repealed the Obama era federal land grab in Utah. - Leadership and Culture: President Trump has signed more legislation than almost any president in history in the first months (over 53 bills) in addition to signing over 46 executive orders. Hes also looking to modernize our government. He created the Department of American Innovation to identify ways to modernize and save money across departments and agencies including cyber security measures. He has established a task force to modernize air traffic control. Perhaps most importantly, he led at home by providing support  financial, logistical, and emotional  through a brutal hurricane season and numerous other disasters. Hes fighting a culture war and I love it. His use of social media is a direct assault on the mainstream leftist narrative they run through the media, Hollywood, and education. I love that it drives the left crazy. I love that he loudly celebrates Christmas, invokes the name of God, reads scripture, and has prayer sessions every day in the White House. I love that he denounces Communism, Socialism, and Globalism and makes a point to talk about STRONG SOVERIEGN NATION STATES. Hes turned our entire culture around and the left is freaking out bigly. Hollywood has had its worst year in decades, the NFL is floundering, and the Democrats have no message. Keep the hits coming! Make America Great Again and make our values matter again! Phew! Im sure there is more but its been a hell of a year and Im tired so Ill conclude with: Here are the things I am not happy about: 1. I think Asset Forfeiture is unconstitutional and I want to see it made illegal. 2. I think the Drug War is a failed policy that I want to see addressed, revamped, or ended. 3. I think the War in Afghanistan should be ended ASAP. I dislike foreign military intervention. 4. I actually think he should tweet about 50% more. Yes, Im serious on this one. 5. I am not tired of winning. He said I would be. (Sorry I had to!) As for your conditioning. Arent you sick of it? Arent you sick of being told Trump has 1% chance to get the nomination? 3% chance to get elected? No path to 270? No way hell get tax cuts through? No way hell survive his first term? No way hell escape impeachment? Arent you sick of the fucking BULLSHIT? WAKE UP. The news media is TOTAL BULLSHIT. Once you realize that and realize how long they have lied straight to your face about literally everything, things will finally start to make some sort of sense. Do I sound angry? Yes because I am angry. Here you are, claiming to be part of some resistance. Well what are you resisting? A democratically elected president? Sound economic, law enforcement, and foreign policy? Your allies are who? THE ENTIRE ESTABLISHMENT? Establishment democrats and republicans, the media, Hollywood, TV and movies, video games and comedians? Wikipedia, Google, Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook?? Everybody is on YOUR side, yet you are resisting? Give me a break. Youre useful idiots. You need to slap yourself and realize you are no different than the citizens of Germany or the USSR. The powers that be dont care about you. The entire loud speaker of the power structure tells you what to be outraged about and you cry into the sky like a bunch of damn lemmings. It disgusts me every day. Thanks for sticking it out if you made it this far! God bless President Trump and God Bless the United States of America! Happy New Year! - Corruption is Treason "

He faces up to five years in prison, fines and a supervised release following his imprisonment. &gt;Department of Justice &gt;U.S. Attorneys Office &gt;Middle District of Louisiana &gt;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE &gt;**Monday, December 11, 2017** &gt; *A Private Investigator Who Attempted to Illegally Obtain the President's Federal Tax Information Pleads Guilty Acting United States Attorney Corey Amundson announced today the conviction of a private investigator who fraudulently used President Donald J. Trumps personal identifying information, including his social security number, in an attempt to illegally obtain his federal tax information from the Internal Revenue Service.* &gt;On December 11, 2017, JORDAN HAMLETT, age 32, of Sunset, Louisiana, pled guilty to false representation of a social security number before U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles. HAMLETT faces a five-year term of imprisonment, fines, and a term of supervised release following imprisonment. &gt;During his guilty plea, HAMLETT admitted that on September 13, 2016, he used the Presidents social security number to begin an online Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). After beginning the FAFSA, HAMLETT obtained a Federal Student Aid Identification, a combination of a username and password which allows students and parents to identify themselves electronically to access the FAFSA. Once HAMLETT obtained the Federal Student Aid Identification, he unlawfully used the Internal Revenue Services Data Retrieval Tool in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain the Presidents federal tax information from IRS servers. In connection with his attempt to obtain the Presidents federal tax information, HAMLETT admitted that he knowingly and falsely declared that the Presidents social security number was his own. &gt;Acting U.S. Attorney Amundson stated, My office, together with our federal, state, and local partners, will continue to aggressively pursue those engaged in the proliferation of identity theft and cybercrime, particularly when involving attempts to fraudulently obtain sensitive information from federal government databases. I command TIGTA, DOE-OIG, FBI, and the assigned prosecutors for their outstanding collective efforts on this important matter. &gt;The protection of confidential taxpayer information is among the most important responsibilities of the Internal Revenue Service and my agency, said J. Russell George, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. TIGTA aggressively investigates attempts to illegally access Federal tax information. Mr. Hamletts guilty plea should serve as a reminder to those who attempt to steal sensitive taxpayer information that they will be held accountable. TIGTA would like to thank the U.S. Attorneys Office and our law enforcement partners for their assistance with this successful prosecution. &gt;Im proud our staff and our law enforcement colleagues whose efforts brought about todays actions, said Robert Mancuso, Special Agent-in-Charge of the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Inspector General, Technology Crimes Division, the OIG unit that works to protect U.S. Department of Education programs and network infrastructure by investigating technology crimes. Mr. Hamletts guilty plea should serve as a warning to anyone who misuses the personally identifiable information of others to access protected computer systems for unlawful purposes: you will be caught and held accountable for your criminal actions. &gt;FBI New Orleans Field Office Special Agent-in-Charge Eric J. Rommal stated, The FBI will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to protect our countrys information systems from exploitation and to investigate those who would seek to gain from doing so. &gt;This matter is being handled by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Louisiana, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, and the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Inspector General, Technology Crimes Division, with valuable assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Ryan Rezaei and Alan Stevens. &gt;The U.S. Attorneys OfficeCyber Security Initiative &gt;United States v. Hamlett is being prosecuted as part of the USAOs ongoing Cyber Security Initiative. Begun in 2016, the Cyber Security Initiative brings together resources from various federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, in an effort to investigate and prosecute cyber crime. As a result of the initiative, the USAO has significantly increased the number of cyber investigations and prosecutions. Earlier this year, in United States v. Johnson, the USAO secured a 34-month federal prison sentence for a former systems administrator who hacked into the computer system of a Georgia-Pacific plant located in Port Allen, Louisiana. &gt;The USAO will continue to investigate and prosecute all those who commit cyber crime.

All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting. &gt; Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration: 1. Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate. 2. End The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free. 3. American Energy &amp; Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral. 4. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable. 5. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications. 6. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-side childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families. 7. End Illegal Immigration Act Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first. 8. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars. 9. Restoring National Security Act. Rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester and expanding military investment; provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice; protects our vital infrastructure from cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values 10. Clean up Corruption in Washington Act. Enacts new ethics reforms to Drain the Swamp and reduce the corrupting influence of special interests on our politics. On November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government. &gt; This is my pledge to you. And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people."""

It doesn't stop there, we even had the Colin Powell, Former Secretary of State, [instructing Hillary Clinton how to work around the State Department server and use blackberries](URL The [email](URL in particular (check the [PDF attachment](URL Wikileaks published to the Hillary Clinton Email Archive. A common complaint to Wikileaks is that they're doctored, like [Donna Brazile claimed](URL However these emails are particularly easy to verify through [a simple test](URL In Colin Powell's case however, Hillary's own [corroboration with the FBI](URL simply proves this. We have Hillary [getting her maids to print out classified documents](URL We had a round of cover-up or ""oddities"". Hillary [got a Contractor to delete and overwrite ""Non-work related"" emails on her server with the help of Bleachbit while a subpoena was still pending](URL Sorry for Hillary, but the BleachBit creator states that [any deleted emails may be recovered through a 3rd party ISP](URL She also had [blackberries destroyed with hammmers](URL and arguably [not destroyed thoroughly](URL enough for prevention of data recovery. Inspite of all that, we get this! Bryan Pagliano, who installed and maintained a private server for Hillary, who originally [plead the fifth](URL was [granted immunity](URL by the the DOJ. The man who was instructed to destroy the emails, a Platte River Networks employee, [misled and refused to answer important FBI questions](URL Cheryl Mills also and specifically [refused to answer FBI questions about Clinton Emails](URL Oddly enough [Cheryl Mills was there with Hillary Clinton in an FBI interview](URL invoking attorney-client priviledge even as a witness to the same alleged crime as Clinton gave [bizarre answers about her phones and her past knowledge of classification](URL Hilary Clinton also had the luxury getting FBI agents to sign a [Non-Disclosure Agreement](URL Clinton and also [avoided Larry Klayman's FOIA requests](URL by the help of the DOJ. Now at the State Department we more witnesses such John Bentel, the Director of S/ES-IRM, who works as an IT at the State Department [plead the fifth](URL He also had an IT Manager working for him, named Cindy Almodovar, who was [never questioned by the FBI](URL And it all goes back to Hillary [circling around FOIA](URL So now, what is our solution as the FBI? Lets not pursue a [single case or charge of any kind](URL Lets setup a strawman legal argument about [""intent"" to commit crime](URL Lets not care we [didn't interview all witnesses](URL before coming to multiple flip-flopping conclusions and then finally [draft exoneration papers at the FBI](URL All of this in summary is why these premises deserves scrutiny and why everyone hates the hypocrisy, contrarian, doubletalk, and partisan mindset of these narratives being perpetrated by the media and even our own government. Now, back to the CrowdStrike narrative about claiming [Russians hacked the DNC](URL First of all, CrowdStrike isn't only criticized for its DNC hack claim, but its credibility also comes into question with claims about how [Russia targeted Ukrainian Artillery](URL IISS themselves criticize CrowdStrike by claiming that [no losses or hacking occurred](URL The report itself lives up to [scruntiny](URL Before trying to explain forensics for profiling hackers we must understand why [attribution isn't foolproof](URL What I find striking are these two points made by Cybersecurity researcher and consultant, Jeffrey Carr: 1. Why attribution **alone** doesn't work in cybercrime accusations. &gt; When it comes to cybersecurity estimates of attribution, no one holds the company that makes the claim accountable because theres no way to prove whether the assignment of attribution is true or false unless (1) there is a criminal conviction, (2) the hacker is caught in the act, or (3) a government employee leaked the evidence. 2. An [Intelligence analysis](URL done by Maj. Robert D. Folker, Jr. in 2000 published by the Joint Military Intelligence College. &gt; ""After reading the scenarios members of the control group formed a conclusion, then went back to the scenario to find evidence that supported their conclusion and ignored contradictory evidence. When asked to justify their answers, analysts in the control group often cited some key information that gave them a flash of insight."" &gt; ""Members of the experimental group examined all evidence provided in the scenario prior to making their decision. They felt confident that they were making the best decision they could with the amount of information available. They acknowledged that their decision may not be the right one and added that if more evidence became available they would reevaluate their conclusion taking into account this new information."" Carr also states, &gt; ""Many of the cyber intelligence analysts who work at companies like CrowdStrike, FireEye, and Mandiant have come out of the military or the Intelligence Community with prior analytic training."" Many fall victim to making conclusions first then reaffirming them with evidence, but especially when interpreting things such as cybercrime and warfare. Another thing mentioned by Carr, &gt; Unlike Crowdstrike, ESET doesnt assign APT28/Fancy Bear/Sednit to a Russian Intelligence Service or anyone else for a very simple reason. Once malware is deployed, it is no longer under the control of the hacker who deployed it or the developer who created it. It can be reverse-engineered, copied, modified, shared and redeployed again and again by anyone. In other words  malware deployed is malware enjoyed! In fact, the source code for X-Agent, which was used in the DNC, Bundestag, and TV5Monde attacks, was obtained by ESET as part of their investigation! During our investigations, we were able to retrieve the complete Xagent source code for the Linux operating system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this Xagent source code has been found and documented by security researchers. This source code is a fully working C++ project, which was used by Sednit operators to compile a binary in July 2015 (at least). If ESET could do it, so can others. It is both foolish and baseless to claim, as Crowdstrike does, that X-Agent is used solely by the Russian government when the source code is there for anyone to find and use at will. So now that the innate plausible deniability of this type crime has been examined, lets see what possibilities exist with public malware. Wikileaks [released CIA documents](URL known as [Vault 7](URL that covers the CIA intensive and sophisticated computer [hacking programs](URL Remember earlier that the malware is up for grabs upon release? Well the [CIA collects malware](URL from other hackers as well and this shows an effect tactic and potential plausible deniability at play. Now, while I'm not suggesting that the CIA breached the DNC like some [articles](URL do, I am suggesting this is a legitimate technique that hackers use and that its difficult to find a suspect with attribution, let alone finding involvement with government or state-party. It is almost worth nothing to adopt or tweak other persons software, but more time and resources are required to originally create software. Since the CIA had severely damaged everyone's security in the process of this cyberweapons arsenal buildup, [Assange himself offered to help companies fix exploits in their software](URL In addition even though hacking capability is important for the CIA, they also have the ability to [attribute false ""fingerprints""](URL to cyber attacks, covered under the group named UMBRADGE. More evidence that compiling software for false attribution to malware is possible. So now that the claim of Russian hacking itself is weakened, is there anything that contradicts the report? While I don't think it is necessary at this point to continue because of the speculative nature of attribution, and the fact that the burden of proof lies with the claimant. Although I don't fully agree, I will list the counter arguments against the Russian Hack narrative to be fair. 1. [Warren Flood's, a data-analyst for Obama](URL name was found in the [metadata of the Guccifer 2.0 documents](URL While this suggests argues that Guccifer 2.0 was an inside job, its more reasonable that the metadata contradicts the original claim of Crowdstrike, and further proves that attribution is still unreliable. 2. [Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) claims that the download speeds for the Guccifer 2.0 hack would be to fast for internet transfer, making a local transfer more plausible.] (URL It is flawed because it assumes that there are no ISPs or networks that offer connections that fast. However, it still makes the transfer speed implausible for certain parts of the world and certain computer networks with multiple nodes, so this part of the premise is more plausible as to rule out certain attack vectors for the hack. What is the most deadly is that the government and media advance this narrative to be an active and significant player in surveillance, disinformation, and censorship. Now we return to [Trump's claim that Obama illegally wiretapped Trump tower](URL Now we know for fact the NSA already sweeps up and collects most Americans' private data from [Downstream](URL (Indirectly from Websites, Email providers, Social Media, etc.) programs like PRISM [Edward Snowden](URL leaked and [Upstream](URL (Directly from Telecoms or Internet Service Providers) programs like STORMBREW. We even have whistle blower and ex-NSA Technical Director William Binney [reaffirming the nature](URL of the upstream dragnets and ""At least 80% of fibre-optic cables globally go via the US"". So there's no real reason to argue pointless semantical meanings about the word ""wiretap"" so fiercely. Inlight of these programs, the agencies deny surveillance and active targeting. [Ron Wyden asked Ex-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper](URL if the NSA collects data on Americans. James Clapper responds, &gt; ""No, sir."" This has to be a lie right? Well does intent count if you believe the collection of data is different from analyzing or directly reading it? However it is irrelevant to the topic at hand. Maybe [Clapper does believe so](URL regardless Wyden repeats his question. Clapper now understands and backpedals an explanation, &gt; ""Not wittingly. There are cases where there could inadvertently perhaps collect, but not.. not wittingly."" So, collection still takes place. Thanks for the information, Mr. Clapper. Unfortunately, we are now at this point in time where popular narratives are using [George Bush logic](URL to justify wide-spride surveillance. That logic that simply being affiliated with anyone foreign or the more rare exception, suspected of terrorism in regards national security. Or it could be the fallacious mindset that since Trump is a target of this, then it must be okay. It's a very fallacious contrarian argument. Although, it all seems to be enough reason to convince people to comply with NSA surveillance and collection of American citizens' personal data without a proper court order. However, does it stop there? Well we had [Obama expand the powers of intelligence agencies](URL allowing agencies to share information more easily with fewer restrictions, before he left office. Even if it did what is was suppose to do [(it does not)](URL it also comes with its [abuse](URL and [consequences](URL Also, referring back to Binney he stated in [an interview](URL &gt; They say they dont conduct economic espionage, that theyre not interested in peoples political views, that they dont blackmail internally . . . Is any of that true? &gt; Thats nothing but a series of lies. You could look at the attacks on the Tea Party by the IRS. They had access to the NSAs reconstructed networking of everybody in the country. Not only do these agencies fail but there is fear that data not involved with national security collected by the NSA can be used by other law enforcement agencies through the process of the [unconstitutional](URL [""Parallel Construction""](URL process. So, even if it all worked with no abuse and these agencies all cooperated and pursued these criminals, atleast innocent citizens data is masked, right? Even though citizens are [masked and that citizens and those in the US are targeted more than foreigners](URL the masked data can still be illegally or wrongfully unmasked. Take the case of were an intelligence contractor Dennis Montgomery, Larry Klayman, and others plaintiffs pursue a [lawsuit](URL against against Ex-FBI Director James Comey and other officials. He alleges that millions of Americans were illegally surveilled and unmasked, and that efforts were taken to cover it up. The meat and relevance of the case, &gt; Montgomery divulged to the FBI a pattern and practice of conducting illegal, unconstitutional surveillance against millions of Americans, including prominent Americans such as the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, other justices, 156 judges, prominent businessmen, and others such as Donald J. Trump, as well as Plaintiffs themselves, Montgomery and Klayman alleged in their suit. Plaintiffs were assured that the FBI, under Defendant Comey, would conduct a full investigation into the grave instances of illegal and unconstitutional activity set forth by Montgomery. However, the FBI, on Defendant Comeys orders, buried the FBIs investigation because the FBI itself is involved in an ongoing conspiracy to not only conduct the aforementioned illegal, unconstitutional surveillance, but to cover it up as well, the suit added. Klayman and Montgomery also alleged that they have evidence that they themselves have been improperly spied upon by U.S. intelligence. The suit named numerous other defendants as well, including current NSA Director Mike Rogers, former CIA Director John Brennan and even former President Barack Obama. There was further [elaboration](URL on an Alex Jones Show interview with Detective Mike Zullo, that worked under controversial Sheriff Joe Arpaio, explaining the where Montgomery's information, while a governent contractor, of the surveillance Project Dragnet Database originated and where it went. The case asserts that the database includes Trump, and Alex engages with the screenshot source material with reporter Jerome Corsi of the illegal database on [video](URL The reason I cite this, even though people criticize Infowars, is that this info seems exclusive due to a contractor not knowing where to blow the whistle on the case. It's worth it to sit through the video to collect relevant info. Now, I know you may roll your eyes but the point isn't who is targeted, it is how they are illegally targeted. From all that we know surveillance powers are expanded, abused, and can be politically targeting. Futhermore, we know Trump's assertion that illegal ""wiretaps"" exists is reasonable and true, and If more revelations occur or if the current case gets resolved we may even see Obama administration participation in this illegal surveillance activity and coverup. Now we get to the ""countering disinformation"" campaign that the elites in government and media are trying to start. Not only did Obama expand surveillance powers, he made his very own government based [Correct-The-Record center](URL The [congressional law](URL establishes government to be an active player in the propaganda (A ""Ministry of Truth"", if you will). This was a [bipartisan effort](URL in response to the Russian election interference allegations. Here's its mission: &gt;SEC. 1287. &lt;&lt;NOTE: 22 USC 2656 note.&gt;&gt; GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT CENTER. &gt;&gt; The purpose of the Center shall be to lead, synchronize, and coordinate efforts of the Federal Government to recognize, understand, expose, and counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts Generva posted [a fact](URL sheet about it. Here's the results: &gt; Operating at a local level, our partners use credible voices to deliver messages that resonate with at-risk populations. Our partners include NGOs, schools, young people, social and civil society leaders, religious leaders, governments, and others. We support them through a variety of means including funding, technical assistance, capacity building, and conceiving and implementing joint projects. So, the US government already has an already erroneous, propaganda-based, and abusive view of its politics and citizens. How is this not concerning to people when they are trying to inform us and the next generation? Besides we already private companies [""correcting the record""](URL that don't use taxpayer money for political rhetoric. Similarly, we have the reoccurring terrorism excuse again but from Rand Waltzman, a former DARPA contractor, who wants to [expand this concept](URL further to social media ([archived](URL by presenting it to The American Foreign Policy Council. It's an interpretation using more George Bush logic but dealing with counter intelligence and ISIS. Now, since this narrative crap is trying to delve into social media. What does it mean? It means Youtube targeting specific political ideologies and (not-radical-enough-leftist) by a [de-monetization campaign](URL It means Twitter [suspending](URL accounts that disagree with them or consensus on the site. It means Reddit [policing](URL of ideology of its users. It means Google, the biggest tech company search engine to ever exist, using massive politically motivated [blacklisting](URL You understand that just because you are not a target, doesn't mean you won't become one?

This is why this [quote](URL is so significant. Its not just about political assumptions about a movement, its about government and large corporations discarding your concerns in exchange for power. In the end it doesn't care about politics, only that it used those politics to usurp that power. We have Google that has the [power and potential to satisfy the censorship demands of China](URL I mean Facebook helped a [man in Pakistan get sentenced to death](URL [Facebook already assisted Pakistan's blasphemy laws](URL in the past to get to this problem in the first place.

The story is exploited and beatened to death by George Orwell style repetition. The paradigm is built on a house of sand, it will erode with steady truth. Regardless of your ideology, class, race, or nationality, you all have been targeted bipartisanly for the sake of just power.

38,cyber crime,The_Donald,"With all this happening, how high up the chain does it go? Who is ultimately the individual or group behind the curtain?",13,6q1gk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6q1gk3/with_all_this_happening_how_high_up_the_chain/,2017-07-28 14:19:17,"I'll be Spezing to make this wall of text more coherent, since I'm way past my bed time and likely missing some transition arguments and supportive evidence, but here goes. My brief summary of current understanding: Dems and previous admin now under investigation after they shot themselves in the foot with the ""muh russia"" narrative, in which the very thing they were screaming turned out to be more related to ***them*** than anything remotely close to Trump. With the acts of Fusion GPS, a company that is apparently PAID to essentially ACT as an agent of the Russian Government, we can begin to see how the dossier on Trump was leaked to news outlets in effort to discredit or harm the Trump campaign. Now whether or not this company is ""actually"" tied to the Russian government is, in my mind, still up for debate. It appears that they've been hired to... well, appear, as if they are tied to the Russians -whether or not they really are is sort of irrelevant at this exact moment. So who funded/hired this group? They've obviously put out a smear campaign in direct violation of US law regarding the requirement of a foreign entity to register as such if there are to be any interactions that are political in nature, or aim to effect US policy, laws, or government in any fashion - because let's face it, if you're going to do some shady shit, you gotta be shady. Their entire efforts of leaking to the media would have been paraded as a blatant disregard for US sovereignty had they been registered as ANY foreign government entity, but especially Russia, therefor making their efforts useless had they followed US law. So we've got a bunch of law-breaking criminals acting within the US in some capacity, while under the guise of being a Russian agent or entity, to discredit the Trump campaign in order to influence the 2016 US Presidential election outcome. Now my head is starting to hurt a little, so stay with me here- That entire ""Trump is guilty of collusion with Russia to win the election!"" has seemingly come out as the bullet that pierced their own flesh when the very same people who were spouting it, were in fact in cahoots with ***whomever*** these bad-apples really are/represent the entire time! Which leads me into the previous administration. Barry &amp; Co., including staffers (specifically Clinton) were basically frothing at the mouth to keep Trump out of office and continue their political dynasty. The Swamp creatures knew they were facing an outsider and nothing was too low for them to throw out during the election, and even now they're not above shady tactics ***post-election***. Just look at how they were screaming for impeachment before he even took office. Someone, somewhere, or some group, REALLY didn't want HRC to lose the election. So what's the plan? Who's the player behind the shadows? Hell, Barry campaigned for HRC to such an extreme that he might as well have declared Trump an enemy of the state. The same HRC who violated law after law, who has evidence stacked up as high as the clinton body county, yet to date has not faced any consequences because Hillary &amp; anyone tied to the foundation need only to place a phone call to whomever is the judging party and remind them of either A.) that donation the foundation made (directly, or indirectly), B.) just how suicided their enemies become - and then *poof* there is no intent for crime and the investigation disappears. The entire collective of swamp creatures are intertwined in this system where money equates power and they're all so addicted to power they'll literally kill for it. How many hundreds of millions and even billions have gone into the hands of the Clintons through shady dealings while supposedly serving the US government? ***caution: conspiracy ahead:*** There are a lot of conspiracy theories out there about how certain wealthy families control governments, policies, and distribution of power/wealth throughout the world, such as the Rothchilds, Soros etc. When you read into these conspiracies, there's a pretty common theme - they leverage their wealth within governments to garner more wealth, and thus power, including influencing the outcome of conflicts or even leading up to political assassinations - essentially they're playing a giant game of chess where multiple pieces are moving at the same time and control over any given government gives them the greatest opportunity to expand their wealth and protect themselves, their wealth, their families, and their legacies from the jurisdictions of any authority. Then consider what the Clintons have done/are doing. If you imagine them as one of these ""global families"" of wealth, it makes perfect sense that no prosecution has come of them for their crimes. They are doing exactly what the Rothchilds, Soros etc. are supposedly doing - leveraging their wealth, power, and influence to control the outcome just about any situation, thereby protecting themselves, their families, their wealth, and their legacies. When Bill Clinton can meet in a plane with a sitting AG in broad daylight, covered by the media, and then there is suddenly no criminal intent for anything HRC has done - C'mon, guys, there is no way they ""just talked about grand children"". Someone or something was threatened, because the Clintons have the power &amp; money to do that. And then the whole thing just disappeared. Barry is tied to this whole thing by allowing corrupt shit to go on, and actively participating in it. So we end up with someone who basically just bought her way out of a shit load of hot water, and then ***fucking ran for president of the United States*** while employing tactics that were designed to give her an unfair advantage of rigging the election for an ""easy win"". Unfortunately for her, we're still the USA and regardless of the amount of shady shit she was able to pull off, we still had enough patriots stand up and say NO to the bullshit that's been happening right in front of our eyes. We almost became a banana republic, guys. *But for what reason?* Now I'm going back to my current question of how this whole cluster is tied into the happenings of right now. Who was pulling Clinton's strings and why? What as the end goal? Perpetual war? We know damned well she was a war-hawk that would have us in a goddamned nightmare right now. It's possible her overlords knew this and saw profit to be made by financing one or both sides, since she was the most likely to take her marching orders and fuck us royally. What about control of the government? If we again examine the Rothchilds, there was once a quote from one to the effect of ""I care not who sits on the crown, because he who finances the crown holds the power, and I finance the crown"". All of these shady dealings, were they above the Clintons with the purpose of ""installing a pupped on the throne"" that they financed, and therefor controlled? Would this have given them the overwhelming might of the US military to come bearing down on an opponent of theirs? Why else would some obscure foreign company like Fusion GPS be meddling in US elections, without registering as such, and leave ""fingerprints"" behind to suggest that they are tied to the Russian Government? The narrative was ""muh Russia"" for so long, now it's coming true, but only with the tables turned - but what if this is exactly like the scenarios where cyber security experts have warned that ""hacking"" can be masked to make it appear as though it originated from any government the hacker wishes? Were their hopes that of war between the US and Russia? Either by HRC winning and openly declaring war on the Russian Federation by excuse of the Syrian conflict, or in the long con if Trump were to win, they hoped we'd stumble onto some breadcrumbs and resort to attacking Russia, perhaps indirectly, but nevertheless resulting in the same desired outcome. It makes no sense in my mind for the Russian government to have interfered with US elections (although that isn't inclusive of every department/agency and their respective heads/administrators), so it does seem to me that Russia has been labeled as a scapegoat by some mysterious actor. Only their plan has been foiled and we didn't fall for that one. But as with HRC simply having her husband make it all disappear, aren't the ones behind the scenes powerful enough to do the same? This is where I believe Trump being wealthy is such a good thing - he can afford to defend himself, his family, his wealth, and his legacy - he doesn't have to bow to threats. Some real fuckery is at foot, and it seems like we're an inch away from blowing the lid off of a global conspiracy that could very well be what the conspiracy nuts have been screaming for so long. I never believed this nonsense before and wrote them all off as nutjobs, but goddamn I'm believing it these days. Personally, I feel like since the rise of ""modern"" civilization (read: since international finance came about) that there have indeed been some Illuminati sort of people running amok, and have been protected for several centuries now due to the obscure bureaucracy of government that allows them to spread their interests around the globe and play countries, governments, foreign policies, and foreign conflicts like the goddamned stock market (i.e. globalists), however we've finally hit a tipping point where technology has brought us into an era of information overload that breaks down the borders and cuts through the red tape that protected these swamp creatures for three hundred years. This is why you see groups like ShariaBlue trying to control the flow of information, because it's the one weapon that will kill them. The internet/information has largely become the dragon glass to these white walkers. It's painfully obvious when you start to examine it. When you have groups that are given names like ""Citizens United"", it seeks to cloud their intentions to those who wish to judge a book by its cover and not research anything for themselves. The name sounds harmless, so it must be harmless. Then if you look into them, they're owned by a parent company, who owns a plethora of ""citizens united"" activist groups who's sole intent is to influence government affairs. This parent groups is also just one of another list of groups (generally 501(c)3's, which have really given these fuckers an outlet to perform their fuckery) owned by yet another tier of parent groups. This is to mask their intentions from the ones that simply ""look into them"". Then once you've taken the red pill, you put two and two together when you realize that someone like George Soros is at the top of those non-profit advocacy groups, leveraging his wealth to garner more wealth, while protecting himself, his family, his wealth, and his legacy (familiar theme yet?) They're desperately fighting back in this information war that they *appear* to finally be losing - but how goddamned many heads does this hydra have? Fuck. "
39,cyber crime,The_Donald,"What I've Come To Understand Regarding ""Russian Interference"" via DNC ""Hacks""",15,6jl7be,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6jl7be/what_ive_come_to_understand_regarding_russian/,2017-06-26 23:52:59,"Can we set the record straight here? I feel like I have a good grasp regarding the DNC ""hacks"", but would like to crowdsource this to see if we can get everything in order. **How it's portrayed by the MSM** Russia hacked the DNC and released DNC emails. This is confirmed by 17 intelligence communities who reviewed the evidence and came to that conclusion. **What We know** We know that the DNC said they were hacked. However, despite being a victim of a crime no single government agency has reviewed the DNC Servers, but a single private company, Crowdstrike, did. URL (maybe we should use the left's own sources so they can see how cucked they are?) In that same citation, it states that the FBI relied on Crowdstrike's report. Crowdstrike, the only entity given access to DNC servers. Also, some more sources URL URL 17 intelligence agencies agreeing on Russian hacking is FAKE News. Listen to former Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper's testimony. * 3 agencies (CIA, NSA, FBI) * Not all 17 intelligence agencies * Total of two dozen or so people involved URL James Clapper goes on to talk about how these people from 3 agencies found that the Russian government hacked the DNC Servers... but wait, how can they come to this conclusion if they didn't review the servers themselves - instead relying on Crowdstrike's report? To confirm that no government agency had access to DNC servers, let's refer to former Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson's recent testimony... The DNC, he continued, did not feel it needed DHS assistance at that time. He later added, I was anxious to know whether or not our folks were in there, and the response I got was, the FBI had spoken to them, they don't want our help, they have CrowdStrike. **So What About the CrowdStrike Report?** We have Jeffrey Carr, an expert in the field in cybersecurity writing an article calling the report ""a work of fiction"" URL And here is another article from Carr who proceeds to destroy the report and the DNC's narrative... ""Problem #1: The IP address 176.31.112[.]10 used in the Bundestag breach as a Command and Control server has never been connected to the Russian intelligence services. In fact, Claudio Guarnieri, a highly regarded security researcher, whose technical analysis was referenced by Rid, stated that no evidence allows to tie the attacks to governments of any particular country. "" ""Problem #2: The Command &amp; Control server (176.31.112.10) was using an outdated version of OpenSSL vulnerable to Heartbleed attacks. Heartbleed allows attackers to exfiltrate data including private keys, usernames, passwords and other sensitive information. The existence of a known security vulnerability thats trivial to exploit opens the door to the possibility that the systems in question were used by one rogue group, and then infiltrated by a second rogue group, making the attribution process even more complicated. At the very least, the C2 server should be considered a compromised indicator."" ""Problem #3: The BfV published a newsletter in January 2016 which assumes that the GRU and FSB are responsible because of technical indicators, not because of any classified finding; to wit: Many of these attack campaigns have each other on technical similarities, such as malicious software families, and infrastructure  these are important indicators of the same authorship. It is assumed that both the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB and the military foreign intelligence service GRU run cyber operations. Professor Rids argument depended heavily on conveying hard attribution by the BfV even though the President of the BfV didnt disguise the fact that their attribution was based on an assumption and not hard evidence. When it came to attributing Fancy Bear to the GRU, Dmitry Alperovich used a type of estimative language because there was no hard proof: Extensive targeting of defense ministries and other military victims has been observed, the profile of which closely mirrors the strategic interests of the Russian government, and may indicate affiliation with    (Main Intelligence Department) or GRU, Russias premier military intelligence service. URL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So, let's sum this up and feel free to add to this with more sources, please! 1. No single government agency ever reviewed the DNC servers despite the DNC claiming they were a victim of a crime. 2. Jeh Johnson and the FBI understood that the DNC was going to with Crowdstrike to review the servers 3. The Intelligence community consisted of a 'couple dozen or so' people from **3** agencies, not 17. 4. These 3 agencies used Crowdstrike's report as the basis of their evidence 5. Crowdstrike's report doesn't even stand up to the smallest bit of scrutiny. What's even better is Crowdstrike's connection to the White House and Hillary Clinton..I didn't touch on that, but there is a lot of substance there. So, the left's narrative of the DNC being hacked by Russia is nothing more than a conspiracy theory "

41,cyber crime,The_Donald,"FBI Director Robert Mueller made unprecedented personnel changes, not only establishing new divisions within the FBI, but filling those positions with people from outside the Bureau. He put an IRANIAN national in charge of the WMD Division, and an Afghan national the Information Sharing Environment.",53,6d0s8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6d0s8h/fbi_director_robert_mueller_made_unprecedented/,2017-05-24 18:05:43,"#### **FBI Announces Restructuring | [FBI](URL | JUL 26, 2006** Director Robert S. Mueller announced structural changes to support the next phase of the FBIs transformation efforts. The initial phase of our post-9/11 transformation was our immediate response to the new terrorist threat. The next phase focused on developing enhanced intelligence capabilities. Today we are aligning our organization to better support our priorities. This includes a strategic approach to human resources, IT, science and technology, facilities, and budget. This last phase is about institutionalizing the changes we have made to date, and building a foundation to support us into the future. The FBI began a huge transformation after 9/11. The Bureaus leadership shifted their focus from fighting conventional crime to fighting terrorism. Director Robert Mueller, describes the structural change as three phases. **Phase 1:** The immediate response to 9/11, which included the investigation, establishment of new priorities and the shift toward countering terrorism. **Phase 2:** Developed enhanced intelligence capabilities, including the creation of the Directorate of Intelligence and doubled the number of intelligence analysts. **Phase 3:** Institutionalizing the changes made to date by altering the command structure to meet the demands of our increased pace of operations and build the foundation for the future. In July, 2006, Mueller publicly announced the FBIs advance into the final phase. &amp;nbsp; #### **A Redeployment at a Realigned FBI | [LA TIMES](URL | JUL 27, 2006** #### WASHINGTON  The FBI broke with one of its most storied traditions Wednesday, announcing changes in its top management that, rather than elevating onetime agents, tapped officials with extensive experience outside of the bureau for several key positions. Former officials of BP, Los Alamos National Laboratory and the CIA are named to lead branches as the bureau shifts its focus from crime to terrorism.  The changes leave FBI careerists in charge of the bureaus criminal and intelligence branches. Mueller also named a longtime agent to fill a new position of associate deputy director, but he created three positions that he filled with bureau employees who made their mark elsewhere: **Donald E. Packham**, a former BP senior executive, will oversee human resources and training. **Kerry E. Haynes**, a former CIA director of technical collection, was picked to run a new science and technology branch. **Chief Information Officer Zalmai Azmi,** whose resume includes a stint as a project manager at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, was given expanded duties in his role overseeing the bureaus computer operations. **Vahid Majidi, **a scientist formerly at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, would take command of the newly established weapons of mass destruction division. &amp;nbsp; #### **FEB 23, 2004 | [FBI Director Mueller Names Kerry E. Haynes Assistant Director, Investigative Technologies Division](URL | FBI** #### Prior to this appointment, Haynes served as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Directorate of Science and Technologys detailee to the FBI. As Assistant Director of the Investigative Technology Division, Haynes will lead efforts to develop and provide state-of-the-art technical support and expertise to enhance the FBIs investigative efforts. He will also oversee forensic services related to the collection and processing of computer, audio, and visual media to ensure such evidence is fully exploited for its intelligence value. Director Mueller said, For the FBI to successfully address evolving threats, we must develop new investigative technologies as well as tools to turn digital evidence into useful intelligence. Kerry Haynes is uniquely qualified to head up these efforts, and I am confident that he will keep the FBIs investigative technology on the cutting edge. Haynes brings to his new position decades of experience managing sophisticated technical operations. Early in his career, he served in three CIA Directorates in various operational capacities. Haynes has managed programs related to technical collection operations, equipment development, and intelligence community partnerships. Over the course of his federal service, Haynes received several prestigious awards, including the Donovan Award for extensive accomplishments in counterterrorism, and a Certificate of Merit for performance under wartime conditions. &amp;nbsp; #### **FEB 16, 2011 | [Newly Released Documents Detail FBIs Plan to Expand Federal Surveillance Laws](URL | ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION** #### EFF just received documents in response to a 2-year old FOIA request for information on the FBIs Going Dark program, an initiative to increase the FBIs authority in response to problems the FBI says its having implementing wiretap and pen register/trap and trace orders on new communications technologies. The documents detail a fully-formed and well-coordinated plan to expand existing surveillance laws and develop new ones. And although they represent only a small fraction of the documents we expect to receive in response to [this and a more recent FOIA request](URL they were released just in time to provide important background information for the [House Judiciary Committees hearing](URL tomorrow on the Going Dark program. **What is the Going Dark Program?** The name Going Dark is cryptic, and the FBIs public statements about the program are even more so. Nevertheless, FBIs [Operational Technology Division](URL states that the program is one of the FBIs top initiatives and has gotten attention so far from high ranking officials in other federal, state, and local agencies and from industry. (GD4, p. 110).[1](URL The FBI has told reporters in emails that Going Dark is: _the program name given to the FBIs efforts to utilize innovative technology; foster cooperation with industry; and assist our state, local, and tribal law enforcement partners in a collaborative effort to close the growing gap between lawful interception requirements and our capabilities._ The FBI has also said that the term Going Dark does not refer to a specific capability, _but is a program name for the part of the FBI, Operational Technology Divisions (OTD) lawful interception program which is shared with other law enforcement agencies. The term applies to the research and development of new tools, technical support and training initiatives._ **The FBIs Five-Prong Going Dark Strategy** The FBI states the Going Dark program is a five-prong strategic approach to address the lawful Intercept capability gap' (GD3, p. 10). These five prongs are: 1. modernization /amendment of existing laws, 2. enhancing authorities to protect industry proprietary and [law enforcement] sensitive lawful intercept information, equipment and techniques, 3. enhancing [law enforcement] agencies coordination leveraging technical expertise of FBI with other [law enforcement] entities, 4. enhancing lawful intercept cooperation between the communications industry and [law enforcement agencies] with a One Voice approach, and 5. seeking new federal funding to bolster lawful intercept capabilities. **The FBI Has Been Working on Going Dark Since at Least 2006 and Has Lobbied Congress and the White House to Support the Program with More Money and Stronger Laws** **In March 2008, staff from the Senate Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Science visited the FBIs Operational Technology Division and had a briefing on Going Dark with Kerry Haynes**, the Assistant Director of the Investigative Technologies Division. Topics discussed included unfunded requirements, level of cooperation/understanding/assistance from DNI, level of sharing and cooperation with IC/telecom and [international] partners, consolidation of tech efforts across industry, working groups/detailees [sic] to consolidate efforts, the data coordination center concept.

He carried out two tours in Afghanistan during the year after the 9/11 attacks and also worked with NCTC in the capital region. FBI director Robert Mueller III tapped Azmi for the job of evaluating the bureaus computer systems. He was a special assistant to Mueller for two months and acting CIO for six months. Azmi rose to permanent CIO in May 2004. When I became acting CIO, I started in-house evaluation of the **Virtual Case File** program, Azmi said. Later, he hired contractor Aerospace Corp. of Columbia, Md. to size up the troubled case management system. In March 2005, the FBI walked away from the VCF program at a cost of $104 million [GCN.com/675]. **Subsequently, the bureau launched the Sentinel case management project in May 2005**. Azmi noted that the anti-terrorist mission the FBI now has adopted has changed the face of the bureaus IT, even if some projects have carried over from before 9/11. The FBI needed an infrastructure, a case management system, and a communications and collaboration platform before the terror attacks, he said. In that sense, we are working on the same projects. But 9/11 has put every one of these activities on a fast track. He added, The sense of urgency is the biggest driver for IT transformation within the bureau since 9/11. **Amid the urgency of standing up the new case management system, Azmi and his staff have reshaped the bureaus IT acquisition process.** **The Sentinel project** is progressing through a series of design approval stages, and Azmi has established several other controls on the activities of the team led by systems integrator **Lockheed Martin Corp. of Bethesda, Md.** The biggest challenge we had with VCF was  accountability, Azmi said. We had runaway requirements, we didnt have good oversight of our contract management. He cited VCFs problems with lifecycle methodology, meeting milestones, passing review gates, providing deliverables and assuring the quality of deliverables. Intelligence IT leaders concentrate on information sharing, because they all know thats probably the best weapon and the ultimate weapon to win this war on terrorism, Azmi said. &amp;nbsp; #### **[Moving Technology Forward: Outgoing CIO Discusses New Capabilities](URL | FBI | SEP 24, 2008** ## Today, as Azmi announces his departure, FBI agents and analysts are sharing information across top-secret networks with partner agencies around the world. More than 20,000 BlackBerrys have been distributed to FBI personnel, unfettering them from desks and providing mobile access to NCIC rap sheets and vehicle records. In full swing is a multi-phased initiative to deploy new computers and improved tools for agents managing digital case files. The advances have not been without early misstepsa case management system called Virtual Case File (VCF) was scrapped in 2003. But in the nearly five years since Azmi signed on to help the Bureau update its information technology program, he has rebuilt it from the ground up. Under Azmis watch, the FBIs technology group: - Delivered and networked new computers and BlackBerry devices to more than 700 FBI locations around the world. - Re-engineered, streamlined, or automated more than 200 FBI work processes and changed some 100 policies to make them more efficient. - Created a platform enabling introduction of new technologies and capabilities on a rolling basis; 54 projects are currently in development and new capabilities are released almost every other month. - Eliminated barriers to searching across scores of previously compartmentalized information sources, including SIPRNet, one of the countrys largest networks of classified information. - Professionalized the IT program by recruiting and training skilled program managers; the FBI had two certified IT program managers in 2004, today there are more than 80. Asked by Director Mueller to help the FBI sort through its technology assets and needs in late 2003, Azmi won the Directors confidence and was appointed CIO in May 2004. Azmi inherited oversight over the Trilogy program, a comprehensive overhaul of FBI technology, which includes building new IT networks, supplying thousands of computers, and developing an information management system, Sentinel, to replace a pokey system built on old (green-screen) mainframe technology. My focus was on building an organization that not only can deliver the replacement for VCF, which is the Sentinel application, but also other applications, other capabilities, other things that the Bureau lacked, Azmi said during a recent interview. The Sentinel program is on schedule for full roll-out by mid-2010. Azmi said he told the Director in 2003 that putting FBI technology on sound footing could take three to five years. He is confident the team and the plan he crafted during his tenure will fulfill the Directors visionand the publics expectationthat we utilize the best technology available, because our ability to combat terrorists and criminals increasingly depends on that technology. &amp;nbsp; #### **[Zal Azmi: President &amp; COO &amp;gt; About Our Company](URL | IMTAS | MAY 13, 2017** #### Mr. Azmi was a member of the Intelligence Community and the DOJ CIO Councils.

Last week, FBI officials said they found their man. They hired Donald Packham, a consultant and former senior vice president for human resources at BP, formerly British Petroleum, as the bureaus first chief human resources officer (CHRO). The FBIs success in meeting its hiring, training, promotion and retention goals depends greatly on improving its administrative IT systems for human resources programs, said Rick Cinquegrana, project director of the FBI Transformation Project at the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA). In September, NAPA issued a report recommending that the FBI create a CHRO position and improve its IT capabilities for hiring and training. The FBIs existing IT capabilities are inadequate and limit the bureaus ability to take full advantage of tools to improve its human resources productivity, Cinquegrana said. IT basically underlies a lot of what they need to get done, the reforms they want to make, he said. An advocate of technology, Packham said all human resources operations are IT-based because everything about employment and employee records starts with the payroll database. &amp;nbsp; #### **[Transforming the FBI: Roadmap to an Effective Human Capital Program (PDF)](URL | NATIONAL ACADEMY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION | SEP 2005** &amp;nbsp; #### **Donald Packham, TCS Education System, Executive Board | [TCS](URL | MAY 13, 2017** #### **The Chicago School of Professional Psychology | [WIKIPEDIA](URL | MAY 13, 2017** #### **TCS is a Member Institution of Higher Education Recruitment Consortium | [WIKIPEDIA](URL | MAY 13, 2017** The National HERC was established in 2007 to support the independent but affiliated regional HERCs.

42,cyber crime,The_Donald,Awan Brothers,23,6dbjzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6dbjzd/awan_brothers/,2017-05-26 04:36:54,"The Awan Brothers 3 Awan brothers are named by Webb : Imran, Jamal and Abid. (A 4th brother and wife of one of the Awan's are also believed to be involved). Originally installed in congressional positions by Greg Meeks who is widely regarded as the most corrupt member of congress. I will preface this discussion by stating you will find some variation in the numbers cited. I believe that is because I quoted from stories as the case was developing. The Daily Caller was the primary source for most of the news on the net. I tried to be as accurate as possible with the facts quoting the sources I found. I am posting this because I want answers, it is not a definitive work. I do, however, believe the breach is every bit as consequential as the hillary email server and the CIA Wikileak. Why isnt the MSM interested in the Awan Brothers: the three IT specialists fired for rooting through House Democrats sensitive files? Who are the Awan IT Staff that hacked House Intelligence Computers? And Why Wont the Media cover this Evidence-based Story? I know a bunch of shills will tear me up screaming, ""ya got no proof,"" but indulge me in a conspiracy theory. I think the greatest disservice the MSM had managed to perpetuate is the fallacy that other than the obvious connection of all these people there is otherwise no connection between these events. Let's assume for the moment that the items described here are patterns of political belief and criminal activity. They aren't individual acts, but on going criminal conspiracies. Let's not look at this as an isolated event. While I'm detailing the actions of the Awan brothers. I believe, but can not prove, those action may have been perpetuated in concert with other individuals at work in the under belly of the government. It's almost as if disparate groups come in contact occasionally when their objectives overlap. As I stated, I have no proof of this, but it stands to reason the flood of cyber attacks and leaks may have overlapped through the individuals linked in the different events. For example, Debbie Wasserman Schultz was an integral player in the DNC Hacks and also introduced the Awan brothers to Congress. Is there a connection? Maybe, maybe not. It is not that far fetched, this has happened before, see the Silverman group. Silverman associated with the CPUSA and knew Jarretts father, Dr. James Bowman and through three degrees of separation used by the NSA is directly connected to Valerie Jerrett. If it is good enough for the IC to open an inquiry why can't we indulge in some similar speculation.  The First anomalous fact is the Media. Why have they largely ignored the issue. Before you cyber trolls jump on me, I would like you to consider two facts. Congress deals with very sensitive and classified material all the time. The Awan brothers could never have had a secret clearance for any other group than Congress. There is no news story there?  The Second error is the ""smoking gun."" The evidence is always covered up with a coincidence, a cover story if you will. While I believe the politicos in D.C. are pampered rubes, they do have a good support staff, and some have been trained to support clandestine operations. The rest have been hammered with political optics for the entirety of their career in D.C.. They are all trained to control optics and the dissemination of the truth.  The Third fallacy is the ""bad guy."" Why does everyone think an on going criminal conspiracy can be distilled down to a single criminal committing a crime rather than a pattern of criminal behavior with one or more groups profiting off the criminal activities. It is best to think of their actions like organized crime and should be prosecuted like a RICO case. An on going criminal enterprise by an organized group or groups of conspirators. The Media Why hasn't the media made this the top news story to at least go along with the Russian hack. Let's face it, the media doesn't care about the damage to the country, they only care about their partisan agenda. If they didn't they would cover stories damaging to the DNC. With a $600,000,000 CIA contract you would think the Washington Post could afford an investigative journalist or two. Perhaps CNN will take up an interest as this rabbit hole runs deep and wide. Don't hold your breath. Snowflakes and ""journalists"" can call Trump a fascist, but there is nothing connecting an enormous breach of the United States Security Apparatus by as many as 80 Democrat members of Congress (past and present). We rail on about the Russians and Trump without specific allegations backed up with evidence, but the media avoids providing nightly updates about these 5 spies that have compromised congress. The answer is simple, the Awan Brothers are Muslim and the ""victims""/dupes are Dems. Dupes who in fact abused their position of responsibility to end up being compromised by their own ""trusted"" staff. Several of the Congressmen involved in the breach have gone so far as to blame the allegations on Islamophobia. Meeks said he was hesitant to believe the accusations against Alvi, Imran Awan and the three other staffers, saying their background as Muslim Americans, some with ties to Pakistan, could make them easy targets for false charges. This story damages the narrative that Muslims are benevolent members of the government and Dems care about the country. It really shows the depth of the progressive aims to ""fundamentally transforming the United States of America. This is where the conspiracy theory comes in. Give me a little latitude to connect the dots, and let's see where this trail goes... An Alleged Muslim Spy Ring - Is This Why Rex Tillerson Cleaned House? The mainstream media seemed far more interested in obfuscating the details regarding the Tillerson terminations than they were in covering what could be one of the most dangerous intelligence leaks in years, of which there has been but a peep out of any major news outlet. Captain Joseph R. John (Navy-Ret.) has stated that he believes the Muslim Brotherhood fifth column has infiltrated U.S. Government, and if he is correct, the Awan brothers could very well be a part of this infiltration. The media is 90% Democrat and I would argue that in recent years the mainline Dems have gone hard left, almost Marxist. They have an almost suicidal pact with Islamists. Where does this scandal connect with Middle Eastern Islamists? One might well look at the set of circumstances laid out above and see in it a scandal that would make Watergate look like a petty break-in. One might then scratch his or her head and wonder  why on earth would the New York Times or the Washington Post, which incidentally just hired John Podesta (speaking of horrendous cybersecurity!) as a columnist, have virtually no interest in the Awans at all? Do Carlos Slim and Jeff Bezos, one might ask, really believe they cant sell papers with such a story to tell? The Smoking Gun EXCLUSIVE: House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs Committee Members Compromised By Rogue IT Staff Fox News is told the employees made unauthorized access to the House computer system. Further, there were instances where House information was discovered in an external cloud server. The contractors in question reportedly were sending and storing House-related information in that off-site server. That violates House rules and it puts the House at risk, a source familiar with the investigation said. It is unclear whether the access issues exposed the Houses networks to potential hackers or spying efforts by unfriendly nations or terrorist groups, at a time when Washington is on high alert for such cyber-activity. Actually the last statement has been refuted. It has been alleged that Imran Awan had achieved a privilege escalation through Social Engineering. Essentially Imran through the political clout of the Congressional leaders he worked for managed to convinced the Capitol Hill IT staff to escalate the Awans to super user privileges to work on the ""Congressional Machines"" in violation of accepted practices on the network. One device in particular was the Wasserman iPad compromised in the DNC Leak. It has been also alleged they may have had Podesta's password. Since the Dems approved the privilege escalation it is now forensically difficult to determine if the Russians leaked the emails or the ""enormously trustworthy and drunken"" Awan brothers sold access to the DNC servers. House Hacking Suspects Could Read Every Email Dozens Of Congressmen Sent And Received Imran Awan bullied central IT to bend the rules for him so there wouldnt be a paper trail about the unusually high permissions he was requesting. And their actions were not logged, so members have no way of knowing what information they may have taken, the central IT employee said. After obtaining access to the Capitol server system, the Awan brothers could control all aspects of a congressman system. They sold and configured the hardware setting permissions and remote access to maintain the devices remotely. Essentially the keys to the kingdom. Through congressional requests they managed to completely compromise the network. They could read email, transfer files, install applications (i.e. key loggers). The latter reports that the systems and network were completely compromised. Beyond that, Imran had bypassed IT key loggers and reporting systems by gaining remote access directly to congressional computers. House Hacking Suspects Could Read Every Email Dozens Of Congressmen Sent And Received The central IT staffer said any suggestion that the brothers access didnt span the full gamut of congressional intrigue was silly because they were the ones giving out permissions. The problem is that once they bypassed internal security there was no logging of their actions. House authorities set their sights on the possibility that a remote server had been used to transfer files off of Congressional members computers. The investigation revealed that Imran had been stealing money, equipment, and over charging for services. In total for almost 10 years and almost 80 Democrat members of Congress were compromised. This is where things go hinkey. Rather than turning the case over to the FBI the case is turned over to U.S.C. Police. They are investigating the theft, not the data breach. Let's state that again... The USCP are investigation the theft of Equipment not the Loss Of Congressional Data. Congressional IT Staff Under Investigation In Alleged Procurement Scam At the request of Members of Congress, the United States Capitol Police are investigating the actions of House IT support staff, Malecki said in a statement. ""No Members are being investigated. No arrests have been made. It should be noted that, administratively, House staff were asked to update their security settings as a best practice. We have no further comment on the ongoing investigation at this time."" The Bad Guy Two of the brothers, Imran and Jamal, have been linked to an emerging security breach The Awan brothers managed to get access to the Dems committee computers by just asking for the passwords. In addition the Awan brothers sold the congress outrageously priced equipment and broke into members of Congress' offices to steal equipment and or data. House staffers under criminal investigation for alleged equipment theft Five House employees are under criminal investigation amid allegations that they stole equipment from more than 20 member offices and accessed House IT systems without lawmakers' knowledge. More than 20 members were victimized by the alleged procurement scam and chiefs of staff for the lawmakers were briefed on the matter Thursday. The former staffer said Jamal was always there, but Imran would only work odd hours. And who is investigating this fiasco? Where is the FBI and why have they left it to the DC police? Is it a ""limited hangout"" they hope to bury by the promoting the administration's ties to Boris and Natasha? D.C. Metro police have been brought into the investigation rather than the F.B.I at the request of the Congressional members involved with the Awan Brothers. A source in the briefing said the Sergeant-at-Arms confirmed the U.S. Capitol Police is conducting an active criminal investigation but said no arrests have been made. The source said the FBI is not involved in the investigation. ""At the request of members of Congress, the United States Capitol Police are investigating the actions of House IT support staff. No members are being investigated. No arrests have been made. Why aren't the FBI involved? I can only speculate, but it would mean that a FBI forensic team would have to comb through all of those congressional computers to determine the extent of the security compromise and data lost. The Dems just didn't seem up for the inconvenience of allowing the FBI investigation to go forward. The Awan Brothers had the keys to the kingdom. Physical security is paramount to cyber security. If a hacker has Physical access to a machine they own it. It is the simplest hack to conduct. The Anwar Bros had Debbie Wasserman Schultz's machine, along with Schultz, at least 80 other Dems also hired the Awan Brothers to provide IT support at significantly higher rates than normal IT support. Jamal, who public records suggest is only 22 years old and first began working in the House when he was 20, was paid nearly $160,000 a year, or three times the average House IT staff salary, according to InsideGov, which tracks congressional salaries. Abid was paid $161,000 and Imran $165,000. Democrats evidently paid the Awan brothers over $4 MILLION dollars. Despite the fact that these individuals, reportedly heavily in debt, would have failed security clearances they were able to receive top salary from Dems including members of the intelligence panel and members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs were among the dozens of members who employed the suspects on a shared basis. The two committees deal with many of the nations most sensitive issues, information and documents, including those related to the war on terrorism. Where's The Evidence? Hillary's Henchmen and the Awan Brothers Hack vs. MSM and Pelosi's Russia, Russia, Russia Meme Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, who was shamed for the Democratic National Committee conspiracy against Bernie Sanders, recommended the Awan Brothers for their positions and Representative Jackie Speier asked for their TOP SECRET CLEARANCE. Whatever Happened with the Awan Brothers? frontpagemag | Last year, eight members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence issued a demand that their staffers be granted access to top secret classified information. The signatories to the letter were Andre Carson, Luis Guiterez, Jim Himes, Terri Sewell, Jackie Speier, Mike Quigley, Eric Swalwell and Patrick Murphy. All the signatories were Democrats. Some had a history of attempting to undermine national security. Beyond the debt, the brothers seemed to have, they had convictions for felony traffic offenses including DUI. Any one of these issues are enough to prevent or revoke a security clearance for normal folks. I guess things just work differently on Capitol Hill. The American military or college grads are denied clearances due similar issues in their record, but not these Pakistani brothers. Any one of these offenses would have caused me to fail my FBI background check at work, but congress can admit anybody. Do you see a problem here? Valerie Jarrett and Huma Abedin are perfect examples of the double standard in the government / Congress. Staffers of any background history can get clearances, but Dems seem to be able to prevent Trump's staff from getting clearance. What is going on here? URL Multiple small businesses and individuals went unpaid as a result of the 2012 bankruptcy. Abid also had an unpaid line of credit of $10,000 with the congressional credit union at the time of bankruptcy. Abids record includes numerous driving- and alcohol-related legal problems, including driving with a suspended or revoked license, court records show. He was found guilty of drunk driving a month before he started at the House, and was arrested for public intoxication a month after his first day. with possibly opposing goals. A felon normally commits the felony tens of times, maybe hundreds of times before they get caught. How many times does a Coke head commit a felony buying coke before they get caught? If they ever get caught, how many years do they get away with the crimes before they draw the attention of the authorities. The FBI, Congress, whatever never find the full scope of criminal activity. They may just get enough evidence to convict of a crime, but they never convict for all the crimes committed. What is really becoming obvious is the Democrats have irresponsibly opened our congressional security oversight to Middle Eastern Factions. These 5 are just one group that were exposed. Hillary had Huma, Obama had Vallery. A sharia practicing terrorist that believes in female circumcision leading a woman's March to equality in the 21st century. There are so many examples that one has to be purposefully obtuse to ignore the contradictions. While the nay sayers claim you can not connect the dots it is obvious that the dots were there for all to see and could have been connected. I would say that the deviation from standard security practices was intentional, but Podesta's password was password123 or some such nonsense. Who knows, our leaders may really be that incompetent. They haven't even made it to the minimum expectations to be employed in corporate America. I really don't know what to make of two very different groups with nothing but vaguely similar beliefs in Marxist ideals working together. Many of the thoughts I have on the subject are almost too extreme to believe, but the evidence is almost unavoidable. None of it makes sense unless someone is lying about their objectives.

43,cyber crime,The_Donald,"Welcome new members of the_donald. This is required reading on the soft coup that took place during election time. It predicted the Susan Rice scandal. This was posted to 4chan in November the same time Steve Pieczenik posted ""The Hillary Clinton takeover"" video explaining it.",147,6deg0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6deg0j/welcome_new_members_of_the_donald_this_is/,2017-05-26 13:13:22,"I do not confirm or deny that I work for any law enforcement or intelligence agency. However, I have intimate knowledge of the ongoing investigation(s) into what exactly was discovered at Anthony Weiners residence and the subsequent investigations that followed. First, people must understand, the Clinton Foundation investigation and the probe into Hillary Clintons use of a private server are two separate case files but they overlap, frequently. To address her use of a private server, the investigation only pertained to whether classified information was transmitted, stored or archived. The FBI determined, internally, that all three of these criteria were met. Due to the political sensitivity of the suspect and her aides, the Department of Justice demanded Director Comey abandon the probe and make a public statement, absolving Secretary Clinton of any wrongdoing as you have seen play out in the headlines over the past few months. The Clinton Foundation probe has been taking place since the summer of 2015. It involves an incredibly complex array of individuals, countries, banks &amp; politicians. The general specifics of the case can be publicly found in Peter Schweizers book, Clinton Cash, which is in fact, accurate. In September of 2016, a raid was conducted by the NYPD in cooperation with the FBIs Criminal Investigative Division, headed by Stephen E. Richardson. The raid turned up several devices belonging to Mr. Weiner &amp; Mrs. Abedin. This included two cell phones, one laptop and router which was turned over to the FBIs cyber-crime division. A short but revealing investigation was conducted which revealed new emails relating to the original probe into Secretary Clintons use of a private server. These emails were originally deleted through unsophisticated means, meaning there was no program used to continuously overwrite the data until it is virtually irretrievable. Words cannot describe how good the NYPDs computer forensic team is, they truly are the best in the world at what they do. Getting back on point, the forensics team at the NYPD was successful in recovering 650,000+ emails in addition to an extensive archive of folders containing images and videos over 1.6 terabytes of data in total. Approximately 25% of the emails recovered tied directly into Hillary Clintons private email server and had classified markings. In addition, very disturbing emails were also uncovered detailing trips taken by Mrs. Abedin, William Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Mr. Jeffrey Epstein and several others to the Bahamas. The amount of time varies between them, however. Hillary took 28 separate trips in total with and without Bill. This can be verified in public record with the FFA and flight logs. It is also important to note the Secret Service was not present on these flights. The rumors are out and I can confirm they are all true. We are dealing with serial pedophiles. However, some of the motives appear to be to create bribes or life insurance This archive of emails and files Huma had appears to have been kept with the intention of soliciting bribes. This is common practice in other countries as a means of political cronyism. However, there is more. The router seized and logs which were obtained from the ISP show that this bribe material along with classified information was purposely with clear intent being transmitted to IP ranges in the middle east, namely Qatar and Saudi Arabia. When this was discovered, the FBI immediately took both Mr. Weiner and Mrs. Abedin in for questioning, as now we are dealing with a national security and potential espionage situation. Mr. Weiner quickly confessed to knowing about the bribe material and is in full cooperation with the NYPD, FBI &amp; the CIAs counter espionage team. For Anthony Weiners cooperation, he may face lesser charges for helping convict Mrs. Clinton and William (Bill) Clinton. Huma is only cooperating to a point. She does not deny the material that was found. However, she refuses to provide details on who she was communicating with and is currently under observation while the FBI &amp; CIA conduct a separate investigation into Humas ties with foreign actors. There are a lot of moving parts and the more shocking evidence (the pedophilia) was used to gain leverage on the Department of Justice who have continuously stonewalled these investigations for political reasons. Following Fridays announcements, the President of the United States was briefed and warned that his interference into these investigations can and will lead to his arrest. Namely on the charges of treason (for stopping the investigation into a suspect accused of espionage) &amp; obstruction of justice. He was placed under a gag order and was told if he speaks about the investigation, he will immediately be arrested. The FBI is looking to charge: Hillary, Bill, Chelsea &amp; Donna Shalala under RICO law in addition to the other offenses uncovered from the Weiner investigation. Loretta Lynch is slightly more difficult because she controls the DOJ. There is an internal battle between the DOJ and the Washington FBI office. The FBI has basically been forced to bribe the DOJ by going public if Lynch interferes with the new investigation. This is one reason you have yet to see a press conference from the FBI. However, things are starting to get dicy and cooler heads are not prevailing fast enough. You may see within the next to two weeks, the NYPD or the FBI have an informal press conference confirming this information which has been leaked, already through anonymous internet posts, videos &amp; former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, Dr. Stephen Pieczenik. There is also a third angle to this internal feud taking place within the Federal Government. Several members of the Intelligence Community have reached their boiling point with the President, Loretta Lynch, John Brennan, Valerie Jarret, Susan Rice &amp; the head of the DEA, James Clapper. This as initiated a soft coup of sorts which started with the resignation of General Michael Flynn who refused to take parts in acts of treason by the Obama Administration as it relates to the transfer of weapons &amp; supplies to Islamic State of Iraq &amp; Lavant. This soft coup is not just a few individuals, it includes members of the NYPD, FBI, CIA, NSA, DIA, DHS &amp; Department of Naval Intelligence. In addition to a coordinated effort of retired &amp; non-retired intelligence officers, analysts &amp; commandos. It is also worth mentioning M16, Mossad, Interpol &amp; independent civilians like Mr. Julian Assange have also put their lives and careers on the line to help expose this hostile takeover of the U.S. Government by a criminal crime syndicate by means of political subversion. There have been casualties already of leakers both of government and non-government. It is also worth noting, several U.S. Military Generals and Admirals have also agreed not to follow certain orders. This includes actions in Syria as it pertains to Russia, Turkey &amp; Iran. Cooperation in Intelligence meetings have literally come to a halt. Right now, the United States ability to conduct clandestine operations is virtually impossible because of this gridlock between the Political, Military and Intelligence Community. However, this is another way the soft coup is gaining leverage. Susan Rice, the National Security Advisor to President Obama has not helped. She too could be facing charges of treason if the right factions within the Federal Government take control. The political actors causing these problems are obvious in the public eye to anyone who understands even the rudimentary intricacies of how healthy government is supposed to function. Those basics which have been outlined by our Founding Fathers in the U.S. Constitution. A Constitution which I proudly swore to uphold and defend at all cost no matter the odds or advisory. I outlined the resistance to the political coup which has taken place. I can tell you the political forces at work lack the intellectual ability to combat the Intelligence Community. The leaks that have yet to come out are devastating to the government and in the next few weeks we will either have a peaceful transition of power or turmoil. The Clinton Foundation probe can go one of two ways. It ends with those responsible for the heinous crimes going to jail or the bravest patriots I have ever had the privilege of knowing resetting our Republic &amp; the world to a status quo."
44,cyber crime,The_Donald,"The ""Best Case, Worst Case"" game and Kushner's alleged ties to Russia",7,6dlzi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6dlzi5/the_best_case_worst_case_game_and_kushners/,2017-05-27 15:09:39,"Ever since the beginning of the campaign season, I've regularly returned to a thought experiment I call ""Best Case, Worst Case"". Before the election last year, I'd consider Trump's worst case scenario against Clinton's best case scenario in any given situation. Take the WikiLeaks scandals, for instance. In Trump's worst case, he directed Russia to hack into the DNC's environment, Hillary Clinton's private email server, *and* Podesta's Gmail account, all to interfere with the election. Even in Trump's worst case, the evidence revealed against Clinton was far more damning. In Hillary Clinton's best case, a foreign government managed to acquire a massive amount of data against her and dumped it for the whole world to see. Even if you try to paint Clinton as a victim of some cyber crime, the evidence revealed against her was *significantly* more damning. Now that we have President Trump in office, I focus more on whatever Trump's worst case scenario may be: In the *worst conceivable scenario*, Trump directed his son-in-law to approach the Russian ambassador to the United States with the intent of setting up a secure communications channel to the Kremlin, all before Trump's inauguration. But why would he do this? There's only two things I can think of that don't seem completely ludicrous: 1. Trump is getting paid by the Russian government to be their shill. 2. Trump is so concerned about the CIA's constant spying on him that he needs to find a way to talk to Putin without the CIA tapping it. The first option doesn't make any sense in the context of Trump specifically. He's already a multibillionaire, has a model for a wife, successful children, fame and notoriety...so I don't think Russia could really come up with an offer lucrative enough to bring Trump over to the mythical dark side. If the second option is true, it means that the deep state is still far more sinister yet, and we're only scratching the surface. Thoughts?"

I can't stand that fucker but he actually made a point, horribly executed, which his peers didn't make. The first part of his question of you piece it together is asking why the Hillary Clinton email investigation concluded before the investigation into Trump's campaign. It's likely that the investigation into Trump's campaign or associates began before the Hillary investigation. Just consider when the wire tapping were done against the Trump campaign. Why wasn't there wire taps of the Clinton campaign? How were they able to conclude that investigation in much less time. An investigation which involves an actual crime and cyber security."
47,cyber crime,The_Donald,Here it is..Muslim professor at ISU faked anti-muslim threats and attacks on himself to escape getting fired. Sad.,3943,66vcug,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/66vcug/here_it_ismuslim_professor_at_isu_faked/,2017-04-22 20:44:56,"This is the body of the actual email Indiana State University students received yesterday: Faculty member charged with obstruction of justice, harassment TERRE HAUTE  Azhar Hussain, an assistant professor of aviation technology at Indiana State University, was arrested today on a felony charge of obstruction of justice and a misdemeanor charge of harassment. Provost Mike Licari indicated he has been immediately suspended from his teaching duties. The charges stem from a series of emails that were received on campus containing anti-Muslim messages and threats of potential violence against members of the Muslim community. The first report of the emails occurred on March 8, 2017. The messages specifically mentioned Hussain as a target. On March 24, Hussain reported an alleged assault in the College of Technology in which he was thrown to the floor. Hussain had been notified recently by Licari that he would not be reappointed to his faculty position beyond the 2017-18 academic year due to the inability to fulfill the conditions of his original appointment. Based upon the investigation, it is our belief that Hussain was trying to gain sympathy by becoming a victim of anti-Muslim threats which he had created himself, said Joseph Newport, chief of ISUs police department. It is extremely unfortunate that this situation caused undue concern on other members of the ISU community, said Newport, noting that campus crime alerts had been sent out following the first email and the alleged attack. Aiding the ISU Office of Public Safety in the investigation was the Cybercrime and Investigative Technologies Section of the Indiana State Police and the ISU Information Technologies Security Engineer. During the investigation, the ISU Police collaborated with the local FBI office and the Vigo County Prosecutors Office. The investigators were able to track the computers from which the emails originated and uncovered evidence to charge Hussain with sending the emails himself. I would like to thank the Indiana State Police Cyber Crimes Unit, the FBI and the Vigo County Prosecutors Office for their assistance in this investigation, said Newport. Licari indicated that dismissal proceedings against Hussain would be started in accordance with university policy. Arrangements are being made to cover his remaining classes and administer final exams."

Congressional IT Staff Under Investigation In Alleged Procurement Scam At the request of Members of Congress, the United States Capitol Police are investigating the actions of House IT support staff, Malecki said in a statement. ""No Members are being investigated. No arrests have been made. It should be noted that, administratively, House staff were asked to update their security settings as a best practice. We have no further comment on the ongoing investigation at this time."" The Bad Guy Two of the brothers, Imran and Jamal, have been linked to an emerging security breach The Awan brothers managed to get access to the Dems committee computers by just asking for the passwords. In addition the Awan brothers sold the congress outrageously priced equipment and broke into members of Congress' offices to steal equipment and or data. House staffers under criminal investigation for alleged equipment theft Five House employees are under criminal investigation amid allegations that they stole equipment from more than 20 member offices and accessed House IT systems without lawmakers' knowledge. More than 20 members were victimized by the alleged procurement scam and chiefs of staff for the lawmakers were briefed on the matter Thursday. The former staffer said Jamal was always there, but Imran would only work odd hours. And who is investigating this fiasco? Where is the FBI and why have they left it to the DC police? Is it a ""limited hangout"" they hope to bury by the promoting the administration's ties to Boris and Natasha? D.C. Metro police have been brought into the investigation rather than the F.B.I at the request of the Congressional members involved with the Awan Brothers. A source in the briefing said the Sergeant-at-Arms confirmed the U.S. Capitol Police is conducting an active criminal investigation but said no arrests have been made. The source said the FBI is not involved in the investigation. ""At the request of members of Congress, the United States Capitol Police are investigating the actions of House IT support staff. No members are being investigated. No arrests have been made. Why aren't the FBI involved? I can only speculate, but it would mean that a FBI forensic team would have to comb through all of those congressional computers to determine the extent of the security compromise and data lost. The Dems just didn't seem up for the inconvenience of allowing the FBI investigation to go forward. The Awan Brothers had the keys to the kingdom. Physical security is paramount to cyber security. If a hacker has Physical access to a machine they own it. It is the simplest hack to conduct. The Anwar Bros had Debbie Wasserman Schultz's machine, along with Schultz, at least 80 other Dems also hired the Awan Brothers to provide IT support at significantly higher rates than normal IT support. Jamal, who public records suggest is only 22 years old and first began working in the House when he was 20, was paid nearly $160,000 a year, or three times the average House IT staff salary, according to InsideGov, which tracks congressional salaries. Abid was paid $161,000 and Imran $165,000. Democrats evidently paid the Awan brothers over $4 MILLION dollars. Despite the fact that these individuals, reportedly heavily in debt, would have failed security clearances they were able to receive top salary from Dems including members of the intelligence panel and members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs were among the dozens of members who employed the suspects on a shared basis. The two committees deal with many of the nations most sensitive issues, information and documents, including those related to the war on terrorism. Where's The Evidence? Hillary's Henchmen and the Awan Brothers Hack vs. MSM and Pelosi's Russia, Russia, Russia Meme Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, who was shamed for the Democratic National Committee conspiracy against Bernie Sanders, recommended the Awan Brothers for their positions and Representative Jackie Speier asked for their TOP SECRET CLEARANCE. Whatever Happened with the Awan Brothers? frontpagemag | Last year, eight members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence issued a demand that their staffers be granted access to top secret classified information. The signatories to the letter were Andre Carson, Luis Guiterez, Jim Himes, Terri Sewell, Jackie Speier, Mike Quigley, Eric Swalwell and Patrick Murphy. All the signatories were Democrats. Some had a history of attempting to undermine national security. Beyond the debt, the brothers seemed to have, they had convictions for felony traffic offenses including DUI. Any one of these issues are enough to prevent or revoke a security clearance for normal folks. I guess things just work differently on Capitol Hill. The American military or college grads are denied clearances due similar issues in their record, but not these Pakistani brothers. Any one of these offenses would have caused me to fail my FBI background check at work, but congress can admit anybody. Do you see a problem here? Valerie Jarrett and Huma Abedin are perfect examples of the double standard in the government / Congress. Staffers of any background history can get clearances, but Dems seem to be able to prevent Trump's staff from getting clearance. What is going on here? URL Multiple small businesses and individuals went unpaid as a result of the 2012 bankruptcy. Abid also had an unpaid line of credit of $10,000 with the congressional credit union at the time of bankruptcy. Abids record includes numerous driving- and alcohol-related legal problems, including driving with a suspended or revoked license, court records show. He was found guilty of drunk driving a month before he started at the House, and was arrested for public intoxication a month after his first day. with possibly opposing goals. A felon normally commits the felony tens of times, maybe hundreds of times before they get caught. How many times does a Coke head commit a felony buying coke before they get caught? If they ever get caught, how many years do they get away with the crimes before they draw the attention of the authorities. The FBI, Congress, whatever never find the full scope of criminal activity. They may just get enough evidence to convict of a crime, but they never convict for all the crimes committed. What is really becoming obvious is the Democrats have irresponsibly opened our congressional security oversight to Middle Eastern Factions. These 5 are just one group that were exposed. Hillary had Huma, Obama had Vallery. A sharia practicing terrorist that believes in female circumcision leading a woman's March to equality in the 21st century. There are so many examples that one has to be purposefully obtuse to ignore the contradictions. While the nay sayers claim you can not connect the dots it is obvious that the dots were there for all to see and could have been connected. I would say that the deviation from standard security practices was intentional, but Podesta's password was password123 or some such nonsense. Who knows, our leaders may really be that incompetent. They haven't even made it to the minimum expectations to be employed in corporate America. I really don't know what to make of two very different groups with nothing but vaguely similar beliefs in Marxist ideals working together. Many of the thoughts I have on the subject are almost too extreme to believe, but the evidence is almost unavoidable. None of it makes sense unless someone is lying about their objectives.

And Why Wont the Media cover this Evidence-based Story?](URL #So let's get in to the basics of the case.  The size and scope of the breach has various numbers in the reporting. It appears that the case is still expanding. This is why quoted text may have conflicting numbers. Earlier articles were still revealing the scope of the breach.  The numbers vary in the reporting but four Pakistani Brothers, Imran Awan, Abid Awan and Jamal Moiz Awan, and 2 wives get an IT job in Congress. Their has been some mention of a possible unrelated party involved as well. &gt;Additionally, it was revealed that these employees were paid more than three times the salary of a normal IT worker, grossing upwards of $5 million dollars combined during their tenure as IT professionals. While the average government IT professional earns about $55,000 per year, Imran Awan was being paid $165,130, Abid Awan grossed $164,980 per annum, and Jamal Awan $157,577 according to government records. &gt;Soon after Imran began working for members of Congress, Imrans and Abids wives  Hina Alvi and Natalia Sova  also began receiving [congressional paychecks](URL The DCNF found. Imrans employers included two members of the intelligence committee, Indiana Democrat Rep. Andre Carson and California Democrat Rep. Jackie Speier.  From 2004/2005 Imran and his brothers work their way in to Capitol Hill staffer jobs to an unspecified number of Congressmen. The reporting ranges from 30 to 80 depending on the article cited. It appears that about 30 representatives added the Awan brothers to their payroll, but they may have done associated and work for about 80 representatives. &gt;Imran Awan has a longtime relationship with some members of Congress, including working for Meeks and Becerra starting in 2004 and joining Wasserman Schultz's office in 2005. The IT staffer position expanded to include more than 30 representatives, including work under congressional members who were members of top secret level congressional committees (DHS, Foreign affairs, Select intelligence committee). &gt;Although personal office computers are not supposed to be used for Intelligence Committee business or classified material, [accessing these computers](URL is a high priority for foreign intelligence services because of the information they could glean about the committees work from unclassified emails. Their is contested information that the Awan brothers did get access to sensitive and classified information. While the emails and internal correspondence would be considered sensitive, but I have yet to confirm classified information was compromised, however a lot of circumstantial evidence prevent me from ruling out the possibility. The brothers are suspected of serious violations including accessing members computer networks without their knowledge and stealing equipment from Congress, over billing congress for work and parts, transferring data to a remote server, and bypassing normal security protocols for IT staff. Their Democrat benefactors allowed the breech of policy for the sake of convenience.  The Awans operated an external server, which is against all protocols concerning secured government information. &gt;Further, there were instances where [House information was discovered in an external cloud server](URL The contractors in question reportedly were sending and storing House-related information in that off-site server.  The Awans had special access to the White House and for Visas.  Multiple Democratic lawmakers have yet to cut ties with House staffers under criminal investigation for wide-ranging equipment and data theft. ``Imran Awan, a longtime House staffer who worked for more than two dozen Democrats since 2004, is still employed by Rep. Debbie Wasserman (As of March 5, 2017) In my first [article](URL I glossed over the kidnapping of the ""stepmother"" not understanding the significance of the event. When I read the [Fairfax County Police report](URL it just didn't grab my attention. One fact I missed was the use of electronic surveillance to control the movements and actions of the stepmother. I also failed to understand the Awan brothers were trying to gain access to funds in Pakistan. &gt;Congressional staffers allegedly held their stepmother in captivity with violent threats in a plan to use her to access money stashed away in the Middle East. The staffers are suspected of using their positions to enrich themselves.  &gt;They kept their stepmother in sort of illegal captivity from October 16, 2016 to February 2, the relative said, telling her they were in charge of her life and said she was not allowed to speak to anyone. The fact that she did not speak English made it easy for them to take advantage of her.  &gt;The brothers bugged her house with hidden listening devices and told her her movements were under constant surveillance and conversations within the house and over the telephone were being listened to. They would repeat what she had told people to prove that they were really listening.  &gt;But as soon as Shah passed away, they came into the house and whatever documents were there they stole, a couple laptops which were their fathers property, and left for Pakistan. ###And left for Pakistan... ###This article proves a number of things that should be explored. ###The first would be the use of surveillance equipment on the stepmother. Yes, I will concede that they could have bought the equipment to watch their stepmother, but I believe that is unlikely. The skills to run a surveillance operation are beyond most IT techs. It's not that they couldn't figure it out, they just wouldn't have the equipment. While the price is dropping, running an effective bugging operation is expensive and time consuming. Let's consider for they moment the brothers had the equipment for other jobs and repurposed the equipment for their surveillance of the stepmother. This brings us to the first logical leap... How many of you have used an in-line key logger? It's a simple, inexpensive device that can't be detected by antivirus software. It operates outside of the OS plugged into the USB port then the keyboard is plugged into the logger. The only real problem is obtaining access to deploy and recover the device. This brings us to the break ins. Why did the Awan brothers break in to 20+ Congressional offices when they already had full admin and remote access to the computers. It has already been proven they could access/edit/delete all the Congressmen's email, files, everything. It is even possible to remotely format a system. They could even transfer data to a remote off site server. There was no reason to break in to the offices to recover data, so what were they after? I believe it was to recover something other than data. It only stands to reason they had to recover surveillance equipment and or Spyware installed in the offices and systems. They were running a bugging operation on congress and had to retrieve the equipment before they lost access to it. #The second is why did they run? Here is the second logical leap. They began controlling the movement of their stepmother on the 16th of October, 2016. No one at least in the Democrat party even entertained the possibility hillary would not be the next president. Even the pro Trump supporters had to admit he was a long shot until 9pm on election night. Almost everybody believed hillary would win and the bodies would stay buried forever. Imran was familiar with the clintons and it has been reported Imran was quite friendly with bill clinton. He was about to dramatically expand his sphere of influence. The Awan brothers had no obvious reason for consolidating their assets and running to Pakistan. They began their consolidation of assets some time before October 16th. This implies planning and fore thought. They knew something was coming. What could have been lucrative enough or dangerous enough to have caused the need to pack up shop and get out of town Was it the health of their father that caused the need to control the family assets? They were clearly attempting to get control of the father's, Muhammad Shah, assets and power of attorney here and later in Pakistan to ""inherit"" the family assets, but that would not have been cause to run. They could have acquired the assets and remained in the United States. It has already been shown they had enough clout to get past any problems the stepmother could have caused. That would not have required a break in to 20 congressional offices and a complete exodus of the United States. In view of the events we know that was an exaggerated response to events, or something else had to change. Was it the DNC hack? The wikileaks of email systems they protected? Was it the proposed changes to the security clearance for staffers that made them run? Could it have been the new policy of FBI background checks for staffers and the request for a Top Secret/Compartmentalized information request for investigation of staffers attached to the Congressional Intelligence Committee. Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and Rep. Jackie Speier recommended the Awan Brothers for their positions and asked for their [TOP SECRET (TS/SCI) CLEARANCE](URL This .pdf is a request for a budget addition of $125,000 to conduct background investigations for the highest level of top secret/compartmentalized information (TS/SCI) clearance for Intelligence committee staffers. This is speculation, but the Awan brothers were getting the brass ring. They had access to congressional data that would only increase with the clearance. This brings in an angle of the story I had found little published information on Nanoset Technologies, but what has been reported in r/TruthLeaks is the beginning of something solid on the Awan brothers web of business interests. ###Nanoset Technologies &gt;Nanoset Technologies were a government contractor that sells IT equipment to the government, but the Awans were officers in that company while they were staff, which is a conflict-of-interest {{ But it's also a way to get equipment with backdoors into the Congress }}  &gt;There is a well-known Bangladeshi doctor at the VA in Baltimore, MD [name redacted]. She was living with the Awans, and was doing business with the Awans--an odd mix of IT and Medicine. She became a CEO of Nanoset Technology while she was an MD at the VA, and the business listed is just a condo. How much biz did they do with the US Government? This would have been very lucrative for their business and open a whole new horizon of contacts and government pork they could bid on, why would the run? What would the investigation turn up? I have to admit I don't know the answer here, but it doesn't make sense. What I do know is we have not been provided a good reason for why they were planning their escape to Pakistan prior to October 16th, 2016. #The Security Clearance Prior to 2017 IT Staff could get access to Congressional computers systems with a simple FBI background check. Members of Congress could pencil whip this if they vouched for the staffer. [Do Members of Congress Have Security Clearances?](URL House and Senate staff members with a need to access classified information are required to obtain security clearances. The Office of Senate Security and Office of House Security, respectively, have oversight over the security clearance process for congressional staffers, and background investigations are conducted by the FBI. [Another Major Democratic Email Scandal the News Media is Ignoring](URL &gt;According to the [CIAs Center for the Study of Intelligence](URL There are no written rules, agreed to by both branches, governing what intelligence will be shared with the Hill or how it will be handled. The current system is entirely the product of experience, shaped by the needs and concerns of both branches over the last 20 years.  &gt;The House reportedly only required background investigations of House IT staff in 2016. These investigations were to be applied retroactively to existing House IT staff unless a member signed a waiver attesting to their trustworthiness and judgment. ###Is the FBI investigating this case? No, it was found to be in the Jurisdiction of the D.C. Capitol Police. As had been stated the U.S. Capitol Police are investigating the break ins of the congressional offices. Despite [Paul Ryan's](URL assurances, I wont speak to the nature of their investigation, but theyre getting the kind of technical assistance they need to do that, this is under an active criminal investigation"", How is D.C. Capitol Police the best investigative force to work the case? Are they actually better suited to investigate a Congressional Cyber Security Breach and track the suspects guilty of the Federal crime [18 U.S.C.  371Conspiracy to Defraud the United States](URL and, or apprehend the subjects in Pakistan? Despite media claims that no Classified material was compromised, if the information Idaho Republican [Rep. Raul Labrador](URL is correct when he said, ""This is pretty outrageous. These are people who had direct connections and access to the House, to intelligence information,... This is actually something that could directly affect the national security of the United States, and I have seen very little reporting, and apparently, the Democrats are not that interested. An argument could also be made that the Awan brothers violated [18 U.S. Code  793 - Gathering, transmitting or losing defense information](URL I'm not a lawyer, but it looks more and more like a federal case. If so, then why are D.C. Capitol Police investigating a crime that could have tremendous scope? So while [The FBI Is Building a National Watchlist That Gives Companies Real-Time Updates on Employees](URL for the rest of us, the word of a Congressional Representative who was also grandfathered a clearance just for getting in to the club can also recommend their staff for clearances. I understand elections have consequences, and our representatives need access to make informed legislative decisions, but through a funded campaign literally anyone can get a clearance. Like an enemy intelligence services wouldn't try to run for congress. At least a spy would have a better criminal record that many members of Congress. My point is the staff needs additional scrutiny and changes to staffing policy might need to be addressed. The staff doesn't need to be trusted by the representative, they need to be trusted by the country. In the corporate world, if the staff covers up crimes committed by the CEO they go to jail, but in Washington it seems to be a job requirement. ###Could a Foreign Intelligence Service be Involved? If so, Which One? Is it so hard to believe the very capable ISI could have sent in operatives to infiltrate the Congressional Intelligence committee. After breaking in to 20 congressional offices and leaving the United States under suspicious circumstances, is it absurd to consider a foreign intelligence agency might be attempting to compromise the House Intelligence Committee. We're building a circumstantial case but there is no meat on it. Where is the connection to the ISI, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Iranians? Where is the connection to any extremists? ###The following are informed guessing. I haven't found direct evidence to support this speculation, but have seen [circumstantial evidence](URL that points strongly towards ties to a larger group. I'm including this section primarily to elicit responses from you, the reader. I'm looking for direction and leads for the next article. Help me out and tell me what you think. [Another Major Democratic Email Scandal the News Media Is Ignoring](URL &gt;Were these IT staffers part of a plot by foreign actors to penetrate the House of Representatives and its computers? There has been speculation by some conservative journalists and experts that they may have had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. A former CIA officer told me she worries that the three Awad brothers, who reportedly are Pakistani immigrants, may have ties to the Pakistani intelligence service, ISI. While the political and faction associations are very fluid and complicated in the Middle East, it can be boiled down to [Shia and Sunni](URL interests in a very Broad sense. Iran and Syria are Shia while Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Pakistan are Sunni and they are fighting for control of the new Caliphate. [This is very broad and in its application difficult](URL but essentially true. This Why it is important to identify the players. Could the Awan brothers have been working for the ISI or Iran? This would also provide some insight to the motivation of the theft of data. Were the Awan brothers supplying information to Iranians during the nuclear talks? That would really define their motives, but we are left with more questions than answers. [Syria's Other Foreign Fighters: Iran's Afghan and Pakistani Mercenaries](URL &gt;A major reason for the disparity is that most accounts of the Afghan and Pakistani troops fighting under the Hezbollah flag in Syria mistakenly tend to minimize their ideological motivations. However, the Shia foreign fighter phenomenon could have serious ramifications for South Asia, because it serves as a pretense under which Tehran trains and indoctrinates militant Shia populations.  Enter Dr. Ali al-Attar, an Iraqi political figure who allegedly has connections to Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed terrorist group. While this is not an overt connection, but much like political corruption, individuals committing these types of crimes attempt to be careful. While many ultimately fail, they think through their moves and are harder to catch. Most complicated crimes, organized crime, financial crimes, computer crimes, are not discovered through direct evidence, but are uncovered through a [pattern of behavior](URL Remember they got Al Capone for tax evasion not boot legging or murder. &gt;Update: New concerns that this may have been an attempt by a foreign Jihadist organization to penetrate the House computer system arose this week in reports by The Daily Caller and The Daily Signal that the Awan brothers owed money to Dr. Ali al-Attar, an Iraqi political figure who allegedly has connections to Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed terrorist group. ###Who Is Ali A. Al-Attar, M.D The first thing that comes up is he was [suspended](URL Proxy Highlight) from practicing medicine - Maryland Board of Physicians charged Ali A. Al-Attar, M.D., a physician licensed to practice medicine in the State of Maryland. Dr . Al-Attar's failure to cooperate with the Board investigation was said to be deliberate by the board. Currently Dr. Ali al-Attar is wanted for tax evasion and defrauding [the medicare system](URL After losing his medical license in November of 2010 Al-Attar got to know the Awan brothers well enough to provide them an unsecured loan for $100,000. I'm sensing a relationship there. &gt;[Philip Giraldi](URL a former Central Intelligence Agency officer, wrote that Dr. Ali Al-Attar was observed in Beirut, Lebanon conversing with a Hezbollah official in 2012shortly after the loan was made. While Al-Attar was born in Iraq his parents were Iranian. At various times during the Bush administration, beginning in 2002, Al-Attar met with then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz along with a cadre of other Iraqi dissidents opposed to [Saddam Hussein](URL to discuss the war, Al-Attar has also been accused of helping provoke the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. Between 2002 and 2012 Al-Attar became disaffected with American actions in Iraq and began to formulate plans with Hezbollah. This would be reasonable considering his Iranian heritage. How does this bring Al-Attar and the Awan brothers together. This is another fact I glossed over not understanding the true significance of the brothers car dealership Cars International A, LLC, referred to as CIA in court documents. [How Radical Islam Penetrated The U.S. House of Representatives](URL &gt;And it is very interesting how the car dealerships finances were strangely interwoven with those of the U.S. House of Representatives. A car-dealing associate who was owed money by the brothers, Rao Abbas, also a Muslim, was placed on the congressional payroll. &gt;Abbas is listed as the IT professional for former Democratic Representative Patrick Murphy, a then-member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and its Subcommittee on Department of Defense, Intelligence and Overhead Architecture and (irony alert) Subcommittee on the NSA and Cybersecurity. Imran actually got Democratic Representative Patrick Murphy to place Rao Abbasi on his payroll. It is likely that Rao simply ran the dealership and got paid for being a part of the Awan crew. This seems like fraud to me. Isn't the FBI supposed to ask politicians about the misappropriation of funds? We'll come back to Rao in a moment. &gt;Imram later acted as [owner since CIA](URL was considered family business by the Awans, Abids one-time business partner, Nasir Khattak, said in court documents. The car dealerships finances consisted of byzantine transfers in which staff and cars were often swapped between it and a dealership next door, Khattak said. Lets look again at the car dealership, CIA (Cars International A). The records show a [confusing tangle of sales](URL and trades, but despite the 5 million the brothers took in from their work as congressional staffers, the brothers were constantly in debt. Imran brought in about 150 grand a year between himself and the 2 wives also brought in 6 figure salaries. Now we have Hezbollah-Connected Dr. Al-Attar putting cash in to the dealership after fleeing the country. At about the same time he is meeting with a Hezbollah leader, and Hezbollah gets busted for laundering drug money with used cars and consumer goods from China. The documentation for the business was in shambles and Imran maintained control of the dealers license. In essence, Imran was able to front for Hezbollah in their auto trading. Also while heavily in debt Imran was able to mass a portfolio of real estate properties. &gt;In addition to his other jobs, [Imran is a real estate agent](URL and Khattak is also a realtor who obtained the cash from Al-Attar and passed it through bank accounts used for real estate deals in Fairfax County, Va. &gt;Having lost my and Abids collective investment of $500k due to Awans mismanagement, [CIA] was further in debt $400k to other creditors, Khattak said in a lawsuit. While it is obvious Imran had some fairly sloppy business practices and was predatory to his partners he also was well suited to launder funds for Hezbollah. Imran had obtained the licenses necessary to support what had by this time become a model for moving money throughout the world. Several arrests have been made showing Hezbollah buys used American cars, ships them to Africa for sale or trade for drugs. At the same time Chinese consumer goods are being shipped to South America to trade for drugs in South America. Money is made from the transport and sale of drugs in to Europe from South America and Africa. The profits are then used to buy more vehicles in North America and consumer goods in China. The money is then laundered by banks like the Lebanese Canadian Bank with some of the money being siphoned off to pay for further terrorist activities. Beyond supporting their terrorist activities they also expand their allies and support in Africa, Central, and South America creating an international presence. It may be a coincidence that Imrans businesses model gots ideally in to the current standard fir money laundering by Hezbollah, but it is an amazing coincidence if it was accidental. ###[Hezbollah laundered money with used-car sales, U.S. says](URL &gt;NEW YORK (Bloomberg) -- Lebanese Canadian Bank and two Lebanese exchange houses helped launder more than $480 million for the Hezbollah terrorist group in a scheme that involved buying and selling used cars, the U.S. said in a civil complaint today. &gt;Federal prosecutors filed a lawsuit in Manhattan claiming the defendants took money from Lebanon to buy used cars in the U.S. and sell them in West Africa. Here is where I begin to speculate. Imran, at this point, has infiltrated or highest levels of security and at the very least has the ability to run the most compromising surveillance operation of the Democrat party, the Congress, the United States government and intelligence initiatives in history. The story of the break-ins makes the hillary server small potatoes. hillary may have opened foggy bottom to the world while she was sec state, but the Awan brothers gave congress to the Iranians, the Pakistanis, or given his predatory business practices, both of them. Then while Imran is compromising Congress he also builds a business that integrates perfectly in to Hezbollah's business model. What if Al-Attar was a fictional partner. The Keiser Sosei as it were for the business. Insane right? There is no way it's possible the business partner who hasn't been seen in the United States since 2010 didn't even exist right. The money trail is there. There are documents, loans, paperwork. Are you sure? [EXCLUSIVE: House Dem IT Guys In Security Probe Secretly Took $100K In Iraqi Money](URL &gt;Abid claimed the Iraqi doctor may never have existed. If as suspected, all of this is a charade, particularly if it is learned the mysterious Dr. Al-Attar doesnt exist or didnt sign the documents, then the whole matter rises to a higher level, he said in court documents. ###I want you to remember as quoted above... &gt;Abbas is listed as the IT professional for former Democratic Representative Patrick Murphy, a then-member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and its Subcommittee on Department of Defense, Intelligence and Overhead Architecture and (irony alert) Subcommittee on the NSA and Cybersecurity. &gt;By 2009, the family was simultaneously managing a full-time car dealership in Virginia, with Abid running day-to-day operations after contributing $250,000 in startup cash. It was called Cars International A, LLC, referred to as CIA in court documents. &gt;Imran boasted unusual clout among House Democrats, and was even pictured conversing with former President Bill Clinton. After Rao Abbas, who was owed money by the dealership, threatened to sue amid allegations of deception and theft, Abbas appeared on the congressional payroll and received $250,000 in taxpayer payments. ###And Debbie Wasserman Schultz refuses to fire Imran Awan. What's going on here? Imran is still on Debbie Wasserman Schultz's payroll as a [consultant](URL Wasn't Imran at IT consultant? His access to the House of Representatives and more importantly the House computer systems has been revoked. What exactly is Imran consulting on? I'm sorry I don't have answers for this one, but it definitely makes no sense. This anomaly is so strange it requires more investigation. #Where are we at so far? We have 4 brothers and 2 wives start doing work for congress. Imran gets a job with Rep Gregory Meeks. The next year he also getting Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Jackie Speers to put him on their payroll. From there he manages to work in his brothers and Rao Abbasi on to the congressional payroll for an, as of yet, unspecified number of Congressmen (Somewhere above 30) Imran is pulling down somewhere around $150,000 and the others are getting between $100,000 and $150,000 apiece. Three times the normal salary for other staffers. How ya feelin' about your tax dollars now? Most likely, the brothers ran a social engineering hack to bypass security protocols and compromised congressional data security. What does that mean? They asked for passwords and access to computer systems and networks, and their congressional clients handed them the access. Additionally they most likely ran a surveillance operation and compromised a number Congressional Representatives. The brothers also established the frame work for Hezbollah to launder money for various items including narcotics to fund world wide operations. Either they did support Hezbollah or stumbled on the perfect operation. Incidentally the operation is perfect for support for Iranian intelligence to follow the progress of the Iranian deal. Yes, I know Imran arrived in 2005, but these operations progress and evolve as opportunities present themselves. No one knew how [Valerie Jarrett](URL obama's senior advisor, was born in Iran and maintained ties to Iran and CPUSA. The presumed next administration, hillary, had [Huma Abidin](URL She has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, a Sunni group. Remember Iran, Shia, and the Saudis, Sunni, the Muslim Brotherhood are fighting for control of the Middle East. Now ask yourself why the Awan brothers were booking it to Iran before October 16th, 2016. This is supposition, but the pieces really look like they could fit. Especially if we have not entirely understood the nuances of the operation. This looks very similar to Russian operations exposed in the [Venona papers](URL and books like [Black Listed by History](URL by M. Stanton Evans. A great read if your in to true Capitol Hill intrigue. McCarthy wasn't the man you think he was. I bring this up because these operations are much like the Cold War Era KGB Ops. Funny how the Iranians cozy up to the Russians and an intelligence operation that had their fingerprints all over it resembles something the GRU or FSB would roll out. All of the facts in the piece are true and cited from news sources. Many of them were in several sources, however, a lot of the conclusions in this piece are suppositions, but they do fit together nicely. Each piece is supported and sets the foundation for the next piece. That is really what makes it work. I didn't know the answer when I started this piece. The facts drew me from one conclusion to the next. I am not posting this as truth, but asking for peer review. What do you think? r/CoincidenceTheorist -23-"

53,cyber crime,The_Donald,BREAKING: Rush transcript of Rex Tillerson &amp; Russian FM press conference.,214,6500np,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6500np/breaking_rush_transcript_of_rex_tillerson_russian/,2017-04-13 04:29:34,"**SPEZ: [This is the official transcript](URL Below is left for posterity.** *This was a rush transcript (that I'm constantly updating for clarification/content), mainly for those with hearing difficulty/or don't have the time to watch the whole thing. Please feel free to suggest any edits/clarifications. [Here is a link to the video](URL for people who prefer that: thanks, \/u\/LabelsAreDeplorable* FM: I'd like everyone to take their seats. Good evening. This has been a long day. We have had talks with the US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson. Just now, we've had a long conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, it's lasted just under 2 hours. The discussions have been proven to be very susbstantial, and frank. They have comprised the whole gamut of international issues. We have taken stock of our current relationship. We recognize that this administration has inherited time bombs from the previous administration. We recognize the need to make efforts to resolve these issues, and our President has re-affirmed our intention to do it. We understand that if Moscow and Washington cooperates, it's better for the whole world. We recognize we need to cooperate on international terrorism. Our Presidents have talked about this. On April 4th, chemical weapons *were* used in Inlib (sp?)... We talked about the airstrike on the airbase. Russia's position is that both the chemical weapons attack and the airstrike against the airbase still needs to be further investigated. We both support this investigation. We have discussed state of affairs of our air force and the United States', and the status of the memorandum for air traffic deconfliction. It was suspended, but we have re-affirmed the deconfliction hotline, under the agreement that the hotline is only used for flights versus the objective of striking Al-Nusra/ISIS. We both re-affirmed our intention not to interfere in domestic affairs in Syria. We are willing to work with the US to achieve the defeat ISIS wherever is exists (North Africa esp). We are committed to find a solution to the Syrian conflict. The US and Russia have been in the forefront of rallying all players to the negotiation table. We both agree to finding a solution, and agree to work bi-laterally, along with the Geneva process, and using other platforms. We'd like to work together to solve problems in Libya, Yemen, and the stalemate around the Israeli/Palestinian settlements. Our ongoing efforts, to that end, will be fruitful. We're particularly interested in working on a multi-lateral meeting with US, Afghanistan, and our neighbors, on the April 14th. We know the Minsk agreement needs to be observed and respected &lt;note, this is potentially huge&gt;. We wouldn't work with the last administration in regards to the Minsk agreement, but we will do so with this one, and will work with the US to implement the Minsk agreement. We want to de-escalate the North Korean situation, which will allow us to create the environment necessary to achieve de-nuclearization. It has been pointed out that Russia and the US have an obligation to ensure regional security. We have discussed further START efforts, and hope more arms control efforts can discussed. Although the White House team has changed, we hope that these efforts will proceed. We have talked about economic ties. We would like to increase economic ties, and buck the negative trend of trade and investment. We have promise to support and start new business initiatives. We've agreed to designate special envoys from both countries to have a pragmatic conversation about the irritants piled up, primarily by the Obama administration. On the whole, we both understand how difficult our relations, and in the world are. There are many who would like to use communication technologies to abuse and pursue [information warfare]. We recognize that this threat needs to be confronted. We have talked subjective and objective points on this matter. Depite the many issues, both real and artificial, we are committed to remaining in dialogue to confront these matters, so long as it is both our nation's best interest. After our many hours together, we hope that isn't in vain: we have better understanding of one another, and we will continue to follow up. Rex: We had a productive meeting, 2 hours wit Putin. We've talked about our relations. Currently it's low, especially trust. This is unacceptable. We will have better relations, we have discussed how to work together in Syria. The FM and I talked about short-term issues and long-term issues. We need to talk together and work together to improve relationships. We agree completely on destroying terrorism in Syria. We agree North Korea (NK) must be de-nuclearized. We agree on better Senior-level communication. We do disagree on other issues. We recognize that in the past, unproductive measures were taken that damaged relations. We agreed to make a working group, which will improve relations and heal past damages. We'll discuss Syrian stability, and stopping NK's nuclear program. We've talked the importance of the Minsk accord. We expressed Russia should withdraw troops and weapons from Ukraine. We look forward to future conversations. Q1: (to Rex): We have heard aggressive statements from President Trump and Sean Spicer, is that helpful for diplomacy? Rex: From our perspective, the results of the Syrian intelligence is conclusive. We have seen them use them use banned weapons more than 50 times. The characterization (by Trump/Spicer) is brought on by Assad upon himself. FM: This is a topic we have a difference of opinion. There needs to be an investigation. We had a 2013 agreement, it went through the UN. There are reports from OPCW that Syria eliminated CW. They also said that CW is under control of extremists. We want a full investigation, with Syrian support. As far as the investigation, there is a fact-finding mission by OPCW, and another one by the UN. We still have questions, and the accusations against Syria are biased by the white helmets [Medical volunteers in FSA-controlled areas, thought to be pro-FSA], and others with their own agenda. Our evidence shows chemical weapons were used, in the area controlled by extremists. We've had samples. We have provided it to the OPCW. It's physical evidence. The investigation drags on. We aren't assigning blame at this point. And what happened April 4th, was timed conspicuously with the peace talks in Brussels. It's interesting that conference was then used to look into this incident, and we believe that an international, unbiased investigation needs to occur. It needs to go to where the incident took place, and to the airfield where the chemical weapons supposedly were stored. We remain unconvinced of the video, TV reports, the allegations were used by the Syrians. We are 100% sure that if our UN colleagues avoid this investigation, it shows they are unwilling to hear the truth. Q2: How will you compel Assad participate in a transition, are war crimes on the table, how long will you wait? To FM: Have you cleared up any issues with Rex? Rex: We discussed Assad's future... Political or not. We recognize the reign of Assad is coming to an end. They've brought it upon themselves. We recognize that Russia is instrumental in bringing about the transition. They need to be involved. The process will take a pace of it's own. We won't accept Assad, and we don't think the world will accept Assad. On war crimes, as time goes by, and more evidence is gathered, we may be able to charge Assad. It's a high legal threshold, but it's possible. People are working on the case now. FM: I don't think Russia and the US disagree so much we can't work together on a host of issues. We've discussed strengthening communication channels regarding Syria and Assad. We discussed the historical background [of regime change], and we talked about today's challenges. I've said that history can teach us about how to handle's today's challenges. I've pointed out that overthrowing a strongman in the past has created problems, including in Yugoslavia: bombings occurred, Chinese embassy attacked, infrastructure bombed, and the bombing went over 3 months... Until they ran out of dual-use targets. In Iraq, Saddam Hussein was hanged, and we all know how that went. Tony Blair admitted the Iraq war justification was a fake. We saw Muhamar Qaddafi was overthrown, and look at the problems in Libya. It's basically a failed state. We're working with Italy to stabilize Libya. It's turned into a channel of human trafficking - as your (US) media reports. There's also other recent examples: The President of Sudan had a warrant for his arrest. Obama decided to split up Sudan to settle the civil war. The President of Sudan held up his end of the bargain - supporting the split, and so Sudan was split up. Then Washington insisted on sanctions on the new South Sudan. All of this support/overthrow of totalitarian leaders ends poorly as we've seen. Can anyone provide an example of successful overthrow? On Syria, we want all players to sit at one negotiation table. As the UN says, the future of Syria has to be decided by the Syrians themselves. The country has to be democratic, and secular. All ethnic and religion groups must feel safe and be represented in government. It must come from a newly-written Constitution. That's the only way to prevent tragedy. Q3: (to Rex) Have you talked today about the alleged interference of Russia into the American election? In what way do you think Russians actions are different than America's actions, particularly against Iran with Stuxnet? (to both) are you talking about resuming the bilateral working group? Rex: We've touched briefly about the cyber challenges... both for today and tomorrow. I make a distinction about using cyber tools against elections and cyber tools against disrupting weapons development. We need to have further discussions about the use of cyber weapons. We both agree these discussions are necessary. FM: We agree on further discussion, especially about fighting cyber-crime. We talked about Obama's reaction to alleged Russian hackers. Without respect to international law, Obama began prosecuting and arresting alleged Russian hackers. We've suggested a bilateral commission to work within international norms on this issue. Obama declined, and then at the last minute Obama wanted to meet with us. Then he changed his mind again, probably because they wanted to undermine Russian/US relations. We repeat our request for high-level envoys who will cooperate on cyber issues. We haven't talked about the bilateral commission, but it can be revived. We do have some channels, and have agreed on more. We can look into ways to overcome extant difficulties. Q4(to Rex): Did you talk about any concessions toward Russia? Did you present specific evidence of Russian hacking? (to FM) if you find Assad did the chemical weapon (CW) attacks, what will you do? Would you support regime change? Rex: We've had no discussion of sanctions relief. We know Russia interfered in our elections. We both know this a serious issue. FM: Rex hasn't threatened sanctions, we've talked only about items on our agenda. We do have some difficulty on the majority of those issues. We don't want to speculate about how we'll react to the results of the CW investigation. We've seen the results of speculation - with the strike on the airbase. We don't want to prejudge guilt. We want an investigation in full accordance with international law. The principle of innocent until proven guilty is important. We told the Hague we want a transparent investigation, and if it's not timely, we would consider that ignorance. On Russian hacking, we don't see the evidence. It hasn't been produced. You have to show us the evidence. We understand there are many people who want to undermine our relations for their own purposes -- these are just games. Q5: (q to both): US sent a strike group with an Aircraft carrier to the Korean peninsula, to what ends? What are the risks? (to Rex) Since it's being sent there, do you have plans for military intervention? Rex: The ship is routinely there. There's no particular intention in it's current location. Don't read into it. FM: We have discussed the North Korean situation, and issues around there. We have a common determination to resolve the NK situation peacefully, and de-nuclearize NK. There are some participants in the 6 party talks who pursue their own, independent efforts, but we should rally together to work on collective efforts. Q6: (to Rex): You said Russia is incompetent/complicit in CW attacks: which one is it? How will you rebuild trust? (to FM) Trump said Assad is an animal. How long will you protect him? Rex: We have no firm indication that the Russians were involved in the attack. We have high confidence that Assad committed it. FM: I say, once again, as in the case of the so-called Russian hackers, as well as the CW in Syria, we want evidence, not words. I haven't seen any facts. I'm highlighting the fact we're working with the legitimate government in Syria, in accordance with UN law, to prevent terrorism. It's in our interest to stop terrorism in Syria. If you look at the Obama administration, they've done nothing stop to Al-Nusra or ISIS, we had to come in and stop the terrorists. We've seen the Obama admin spared the Al-Nusra front. We think the Al-Nusra front is (Obama's) Plan B, to overthrow Assad. As far as CW in Syria, we need the investigation, we need to take the time... and as far as priorities, we agree ISIS is first priority. Spicer and Kerry said the same thing. They both agree ISIS is the priority. We think along the same lines. We see along the same lines. We don't want to overthrow the regime while ISIS remains a threat."
54,cyber crime,The_Donald,POTUS: Illegal immigrant criminals are 'getting the hell out!,41,664ltq,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/664ltq/potus_illegal_immigrant_criminals_are_getting_the/,2017-04-19 04:14:36," Trump: Illegal immigrant criminals are 'getting the hell out' By Cody Derespina | FoxNews.com Published April 18, 2017 *President Trump told Fox News that criminal illegal immigrants are getting the hell out of the U.S. or being thrown behind bars, as he also took to Twitter to rail against gangs like MS-13 and the Obama administration policies he claims allowed them to flourish in American cities.* In an interview that aired Tuesday morning on Fox &amp; Friends, Trump spoke highly of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who is responsible for enforcing Trumps border policy. Reprising remarks he made at the very start of his presidential bid, he emphasized the importance of removing criminal aliens. **Weve gotten tremendous criminals out of this country**, Trump said. **Im talking about illegal immigrants that were here that caused tremendous crime. That have murdered people, raped people  horrible things have happened. Theyre getting the hell out or theyre going to prison**. Trump echoed those comments on Twitter, pointing to Central American export MS-13, a gang thought to be behind a quadruple homicide on Long Island last week. Though the gang has been around for decades, its grown more dangerous. The weak illegal immigration policies of the Obama Admin. allowed bad MS-13 gangs to form in cities across U.S. We are removing them fast! Trump tweeted. Deporting illegal immigrants and clamping down on crime were central planks of Trumps presidential platform. As he tightens immigration policies, Kelly and Attorney General Jeff Sessions are planning to visit the U.S.-Mexico border together later this week. **""And so many towns and cities are thanking me because we have gotten rid of a burden that you would not believe. It is a serious problem and we never did anything about it, and now were doing something about it, Trump told Fox News. ** *On North Korea, Trump again refused to spell out his strategy for dealing with the countrys volatile dictator. He also wouldnt comment when asked if the U.S. disrupted a recent North Korea missile test via cyber weapons. I dont want to telegraph what Im doing or what Im thinking ... well see what happens, Trump said. I hope things work out well. I hope theres going to be peace. But you know, theyve been talking with this gentleman for a long time ... everybodys been outplayed. Theyve all been outplayed by this gentleman and well see what happens. Asked what would happen if North Korea were to test another missile  as it has vowed to do  Trump cryptically replied: Well find out.*"

A delegation of officials from the US met their counterparts in the Home Ministry last week and discussed ways to streamline the training programmes being conducted under the Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) pact. Indian police officers will undergo training programmes in the US training institutes on negotiations in hostage situations, terror crime scene investigations, besides on two new courses relating to cyber crime and maritime security. India and the US are working towards strengthening bilateral ties on security front, including training programmes. The US will be introducing two new courses for Indian police officers this year, a Home Ministry official said. Indian police officers currently can opt for six training programmes under the ATA pact. These courses have been an integral part of the bilateral cooperation on internal security between the two countries. India is a key strategic partner of the US in its war on terror and with groups like ISIS using Internet to reach out to potential recruits in India, the ATA courses are seen as extremely relevant, the official said. Currently the ATA courses include among others, investigating the dark web (IDW), hostage negotiation training, terrorist crime scene investigation. Around 120-150 police officers from Central police organisations and state police forces visit the US every year for training in these courses under the ATA. The number may go up to 200 this year with introduction of two new courses."
56,cyber crime,The_Donald,BREAKING!! Wikileaks summary of their Vault 7 release. CIA wiretapped your TV and iPhone!!,317,5y09xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5y09xj/breaking_wikileaks_summary_of_their_vault_7/,2017-03-08 00:20:14,"[Wikileaks Vault 7 Release](URL &amp;nbsp; **Press Release** &amp;nbsp; Today, Tuesday 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks begins its new series of leaks on the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Code-named ""Vault 7"" by WikiLeaks, it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency. The first full part of the series, ""Year Zero"", comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election. Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized ""zero day"" exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive. ""Year Zero"" introduces the scope and direction of the CIA's global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of ""zero day"" weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple's iPhone, Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones. Since 2001 the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA found itself building not just its now infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force  its own substantial fleet of hackers. The agency's hacking division freed it from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA (its primary bureaucratic rival) in order to draw on the NSA's hacking capacities. By the end of 2016, the CIA's hacking division, which formally falls under the agency's Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI), had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other ""weaponized"" malware. Such is the scale of the CIA's undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook. The CIA had created, in effect, its ""own NSA"" with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified. In a statement to WikiLeaks the source details policy questions that they say urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the CIA's hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency. The source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons. Once a single cyber 'weapon' is 'loose' it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by rival states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike. Julian Assange, WikiLeaks editor stated that ""There is an extreme proliferation risk in the development of cyber 'weapons'. Comparisons can be drawn between the uncontrolled proliferation of such 'weapons', which results from the inability to contain them combined with their high market value, and the global arms trade. But the significance of ""Year Zero"" goes well beyond the choice between cyberwar and cyberpeace. The disclosure is also exceptional from a political, legal and forensic perspective."" Wikileaks has carefully reviewed the ""Year Zero"" disclosure and published substantive CIA documentation while avoiding the distribution of 'armed' cyberweapons until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA's program and how such 'weapons' should analyzed, disarmed and published. Wikileaks has also decided to redact and anonymise some identifying information in ""Year Zero"" for in depth analysis. These redactions include ten of thousands of CIA targets and attack machines throughout Latin America, Europe and the United States. While we are aware of the imperfect results of any approach chosen, we remain committed to our publishing model and note that the quantity of published pages in ""Vault 7"" part one (Year Zero) already eclipses the total number of pages published over the first three years of the Edward Snowden NSA leaks. &amp;nbsp; **Analysis** CIA malware targets iPhone, Android, smart TVs CIA malware and hacking tools are built by EDG (Engineering Development Group), a software development group within CCI (Center for Cyber Intelligence), a department belonging to the CIA's DDI (Directorate for Digital Innovation). The DDI is one of the five major directorates of the CIA (see this organizational chart of the CIA for more details). The EDG is responsible for the development, testing and operational support of all backdoors, exploits, malicious payloads, trojans, viruses and any other kind of malware used by the CIA in its covert operations world-wide. The increasing sophistication of surveillance techniques has drawn comparisons with George Orwell's 1984, but ""Weeping Angel"", developed by the CIA's Embedded Devices Branch (EDB), which infests smart TVs, transforming them into covert microphones, is surely its most emblematic realization. The attack against Samsung smart TVs was developed in cooperation with the United Kingdom's MI5/BTSS. After infestation, Weeping Angel places the target TV in a 'Fake-Off' mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. In 'Fake-Off' mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server. As of October 2014 the CIA was also looking at infecting the vehicle control systems used by modern cars and trucks. The purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations. The CIA's Mobile Devices Branch (MDB) developed numerous attacks to remotely hack and control popular smart phones. Infected phones can be instructed to send the CIA the user's geolocation, audio and text communications as well as covertly activate the phone's camera and microphone. Despite iPhone's minority share (14.5%) of the global smart phone market in 2016, a specialized unit in the CIA's Mobile Development Branch produces malware to infest, control and exfiltrate data from iPhones and other Apple products running iOS, such as iPads. CIA's arsenal includes numerous local and remote ""zero days"" developed by CIA or obtained from GCHQ, NSA, FBI or purchased from cyber arms contractors such as Baitshop. The disproportionate focus on iOS may be explained by the popularity of the iPhone among social, political, diplomatic and business elites. A similar unit targets Google's Android which is used to run the majority of the world's smart phones (~85%) including Samsung, HTC and Sony. 1.15 billion Android powered phones were sold last year. ""Year Zero"" shows that as of 2016 the CIA had 24 ""weaponized"" Android ""zero days"" which it has developed itself and obtained from GCHQ, NSA and cyber arms contractors. These techniques permit the CIA to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Wiebo, Confide and Cloackman by hacking the ""smart"" phones that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied. &amp;nbsp; **CIA malware targets Windows, OSx, Linux, routers** The CIA also runs a very substantial effort to infect and control Microsoft Windows users with its malware. This includes multiple local and remote weaponized ""zero days"", air gap jumping viruses such as ""Hammer Drill"" which infects software distributed on CD/DVDs, infectors for removable media such as USBs, systems to hide data in images or in covert disk areas ( ""Brutal Kangaroo"") and to keep its malware infestations going. Many of these infection efforts are pulled together by the CIA's Automated Implant Branch (AIB), which has developed several attack systems for automated infestation and control of CIA malware, such as ""Assassin"" and ""Medusa"". Attacks against Internet infrastructure and webservers are developed by the CIA's Network Devices Branch (NDB). The CIA has developed automated multi-platform malware attack and control systems covering Windows, Mac OS X, Solaris, Linux and more, such as EDB's ""HIVE"" and the related ""Cutthroat"" and ""Swindle"" tools, which are described in the examples section below. &amp;nbsp; **CIA 'hoarded' vulnerabilities (""zero days"")** In the wake of Edward Snowden's leaks about the NSA, the U.S. technology industry secured a commitment from the Obama administration that the executive would disclose on an ongoing basis  rather than hoard  serious vulnerabilities, exploits, bugs or ""zero days"" to Apple, Google, Microsoft, and other US-based manufacturers. Serious vulnerabilities not disclosed to the manufacturers places huge swathes of the population and critical infrastructure at risk to foreign intelligence or cyber criminals who independently discover or hear rumors of the vulnerability. If the CIA can discover such vulnerabilities so can others. The U.S. government's commitment to the Vulnerabilities Equities Process came after significant lobbying by US technology companies, who risk losing their share of the global market over real and perceived hidden vulnerabilities. The government stated that it would disclose all pervasive vulnerabilities discovered after 2010 on an ongoing basis. ""Year Zero"" documents show that the CIA breached the Obama administration's commitments. Many of the vulnerabilities used in the CIA's cyber arsenal are pervasive and some may already have been found by rival intelligence agencies or cyber criminals. As an example, specific CIA malware revealed in ""Year Zero"" is able to penetrate, infest and control both the Android phone and iPhone software that runs or has run presidential Twitter accounts. The CIA attacks this software by using undisclosed security vulnerabilities (""zero days"") possessed by the CIA but if the CIA can hack these phones then so can everyone else who has obtained or discovered the vulnerability. As long as the CIA keeps these vulnerabilities concealed from Apple and Google (who make the phones) they will not be fixed, and the phones will remain hackable. The same vulnerabilities exist for the population at large, including the U.S. Cabinet, Congress, top CEOs, system administrators, security officers and engineers. By hiding these security flaws from manufacturers like Apple and Google the CIA ensures that it can hack everyone &amp;mdsh; at the expense of leaving everyone hackable. &amp;nbsp; **'Cyberwar' programs are a serious proliferation risk** Cyber 'weapons' are not possible to keep under effective control. While nuclear proliferation has been restrained by the enormous costs and visible infrastructure involved in assembling enough fissile material to produce a critical nuclear mass, cyber 'weapons', once developed, are very hard to retain. Cyber 'weapons' are in fact just computer programs which can be pirated like any other. Since they are entirely comprised of information they can be copied quickly with no marginal cost. Securing such 'weapons' is particularly difficult since the same people who develop and use them have the skills to exfiltrate copies without leaving traces  sometimes by using the very same 'weapons' against the organizations that contain them. There are substantial price incentives for government hackers and consultants to obtain copies since there is a global ""vulnerability market"" that will pay hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars for copies of such 'weapons'. Similarly, contractors and companies who obtain such 'weapons' sometimes use them for their own purposes, obtaining advantage over their competitors in selling 'hacking' services. Over the last three years the United States intelligence sector, which consists of government agencies such as the CIA and NSA and their contractors, such as Booze Allan Hamilton, has been subject to unprecedented series of data exfiltrations by its own workers. A number of intelligence community members not yet publicly named have been arrested or subject to federal criminal investigations in separate incidents. Most visibly, on February 8, 2017 a U.S. federal grand jury indicted Harold T. Martin III with 20 counts of mishandling classified information. The Department of Justice alleged that it seized some 50,000 gigabytes of information from Harold T. Martin III that he had obtained from classified programs at NSA and CIA, including the source code for numerous hacking tools. Once a single cyber 'weapon' is 'loose' it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by peer states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike. &amp;nbsp; **U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt is a covert CIA hacker base** In addition to its operations in Langley, Virginia the CIA also uses the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt as a covert base for its hackers covering Europe, the Middle East and Africa. CIA hackers operating out of the Frankfurt consulate ( ""Center for Cyber Intelligence Europe"" or CCIE) are given diplomatic (""black"") passports and State Department cover. The instructions for incoming CIA hackers make Germany's counter-intelligence efforts appear inconsequential: ""Breeze through German Customs because you have your cover-for-action story down pat, and all they did was stamp your passport"" Your Cover Story (for this trip) Q: Why are you here? A: Supporting technical consultations at the Consulate. Two earlier WikiLeaks publications give further detail on CIA approaches to customs and secondary screening procedures. Once in Frankfurt CIA hackers can travel without further border checks to the 25 European countries that are part of the Shengen open border area  including France, Italy and Switzerland. A number of the CIA's electronic attack methods are designed for physical proximity. These attack methods are able to penetrate high security networks that are disconnected from the internet, such as police record database. In these cases, a CIA officer, agent or allied intelligence officer acting under instructions, physically infiltrates the targeted workplace. The attacker is provided with a USB containing malware developed for the CIA for this purpose, which is inserted into the targeted computer. The attacker then infects and exfiltrates data to removable media. For example, the CIA attack system Fine Dining, provides 24 decoy applications for CIA spies to use. To witnesses, the spy appears to be running a program showing videos (e.g VLC), presenting slides (Prezi), playing a computer game (Breakout2, 2048) or even running a fake virus scanner (Kaspersky, McAfee, Sophos). But while the decoy application is on the screen, the underlaying system is automatically infected and ransacked. &amp;nbsp; **How the CIA dramatically increased proliferation risks** In what is surely one of the most astounding intelligence own goals in living memory, the CIA structured its classification regime such that for the most market valuable part of ""Vault 7""  the CIA's weaponized malware (implants + zero days), Listening Posts (LP), and Command and Control (C2) systems  the agency has little legal recourse. The CIA made these systems unclassified. Why the CIA chose to make its cyberarsenal unclassified reveals how concepts developed for military use do not easily crossover to the 'battlefield' of cyber 'war'. To attack its targets, the CIA usually requires that its implants communicate with their control programs over the internet. If CIA implants, Command &amp; Control and Listening Post software were classified, then CIA officers could be prosecuted or dismissed for violating rules that prohibit placing classified information onto the Internet. Consequently the CIA has secretly made most of its cyber spying/war code unclassified. The U.S. government is not able to assert copyright either, due to restrictions in the U.S. Constitution. This means that cyber 'arms' manufactures and computer hackers can freely ""pirate"" these 'weapons' if they are obtained. The CIA has primarily had to rely on obfuscation to protect its malware secrets. Conventional weapons such as missiles may be fired at the enemy (i.e into an unsecured area). Proximity to or impact with the target detonates the ordnance including its classified parts. Hence military personnel do not violate classification rules by firing ordnance with classified parts. Ordnance will likely explode. If it does not, that is not the operator's intent. Over the last decade U.S. hacking operations have been increasingly dressed up in military jargon to tap into Department of Defense funding streams. For instance, attempted ""malware injections"" (commercial jargon) or ""implant drops"" (NSA jargon) are being called ""fires"" as if a weapon was being fired. However the analogy is questionable. Unlike bullets, bombs or missiles, most CIA malware is designed to live for days or even years after it has reached its 'target'. CIA malware does not ""explode on impact"" but rather permanently infests its target. In order to infect target's device, copies of the malware must be placed on the target's devices, giving physical possession of the malware to the target. To exfiltrate data back to the CIA or to await further instructions the malware must communicate with CIA Command &amp; Control (C2) systems placed on internet connected servers. But such servers are typically not approved to hold classified information, so CIA command and control systems are also made unclassified. A successful 'attack' on a target's computer system is more like a series of complex stock maneuvers in a hostile take-over bid or the careful planting of rumors in order to gain control over an organization's leadership rather than the firing of a weapons system. If there is a military analogy to be made, the infestation of a target is perhaps akin to the execution of a whole series of military maneuvers against the target's territory including observation, infiltration, occupation and exploitation. &amp;nbsp; **Evading forensics and anti-virus** A series of standards lay out CIA malware infestation patterns which are likely to assist forensic crime scene investigators as well as Apple, Microsoft, Google, Samsung, Nokia, Blackberry, Siemens and anti-virus companies attribute and defend against attacks. ""Tradecraft DO's and DON'Ts"" contains CIA rules on how its malware should be written to avoid fingerprints implicating the ""CIA, US government, or its witting partner companies"" in ""forensic review"". Similar secret standards cover the use of encryption to hide CIA hacker and malware communication (pdf), describing targets &amp; exfiltrated data (pdf) as well as executing payloads (pdf) and persisting (pdf) in the target's machines over time. CIA hackers developed successful attacks against most well known anti-virus programs. These are documented in AV defeats, Personal Security Products, Detecting and defeating PSPs and PSP/Debugger/RE Avoidance. For example, Comodo was defeated by CIA malware placing itself in the Window's ""Recycle Bin"". While Comodo 6.x has a ""Gaping Hole of DOOM"". CIA hackers discussed what the NSA's ""Equation Group"" hackers did wrong and how the CIA's malware makers could avoid similar exposure. &amp;nbsp; **EXAMPLES** The CIA's Engineering Development Group (EDG) management system contains around 500 different projects (only some of which are documented by ""Year Zero"") each with their own sub-projects, malware and hacker tools. The majority of these projects relate to tools that are used for penetration, infestation (""implanting""), control, and exfiltration. Another branch of development focuses on the development and operation of Listening Posts (LP) and Command and Control (C2) systems used to communicate with and control CIA implants; special projects are used to target specific hardware from routers to smart TVs. Some example projects are described below, but see the table of contents for the full list of projects described by WikiLeaks' ""Year Zero"". &amp;nbsp; **UMBRAGE** The CIA's hand crafted hacking techniques pose a problem for the agency. Each technique it has created forms a ""fingerprint"" that can be used by forensic investigators to attribute multiple different attacks to the same entity. This is analogous to finding the same distinctive knife wound on multiple separate murder victims. The unique wounding style creates suspicion that a single murderer is responsible. As soon one murder in the set is solved then the other murders also find likely attribution. The CIA's Remote Devices Branch's UMBRAGE group collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques 'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation. With UMBRAGE and related projects the CIA cannot only increase its total number of attack types but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the ""fingerprints"" of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from. UMBRAGE components cover keyloggers, password collection, webcam capture, data destruction, persistence, privilege escalation, stealth, anti-virus (PSP) avoidance and survey techniques. &amp;nbsp; **Fine Dining** Fine Dining comes with a standardized questionnaire i.e menu that CIA case officers fill out. The questionnaire is used by the agency's OSB (Operational Support Branch) to transform the requests of case officers into technical requirements for hacking attacks (typically ""exfiltrating"" information from computer systems) for specific operations. The questionnaire allows the OSB to identify how to adapt existing tools for the operation, and communicate this to CIA malware configuration staff. The OSB functions as the interface between CIA operational staff and the relevant technical support staff. Among the list of possible targets of the collection are 'Asset', 'Liason Asset', 'System Administrator', 'Foreign Information Operations', 'Foreign Intelligence Agencies' and 'Foreign Government Entities'. Notably absent is any reference to extremists or transnational criminals. The 'Case Officer' is also asked to specify the environment of the target like the type of computer, operating system used, Internet connectivity and installed anti-virus utilities (PSPs) as well as a list of file types to be exfiltrated like Office documents, audio, video, images or custom file types. The 'menu' also asks for information if recurring access to the target is possible and how long unobserved access to the computer can be maintained. This information is used by the CIA's 'JQJIMPROVISE' software (see below) to configure a set of CIA malware suited to the specific needs of an operation. &amp;nbsp; **Improvise (JQJIMPROVISE)** 'Improvise' is a toolset for configuration, post-processing, payload setup and execution vector selection for survey/exfiltration tools supporting all major operating systems like Windows (Bartender), MacOS (JukeBox) and Linux (DanceFloor). Its configuration utilities like Margarita allows the NOC (Network Operation Center) to customize tools based on requirements from 'Fine Dining' questionairies. &amp;nbsp; **HIVE** HIVE is a multi-platform CIA malware suite and its associated control software. The project provides customizable implants for Windows, Solaris, MikroTik (used in internet routers) and Linux platforms and a Listening Post (LP)/Command and Control (C2) infrastructure to communicate with these implants. The implants are configured to communicate via HTTPS with the webserver of a cover domain; each operation utilizing these implants has a separate cover domain and the infrastructure can handle any number of cover domains. Each cover domain resolves to an IP address that is located at a commercial VPS (Virtual Private Server) provider. The public-facing server forwards all incoming traffic via a VPN to a 'Blot' server that handles actual connection requests from clients. It is setup for optional SSL client authentication: if a client sends a valid client certificate (only implants can do that), the connection is forwarded to the 'Honeycomb' toolserver that communicates with the implant; if a valid certificate is missing (which is the case if someone tries to open the cover domain website by accident), the traffic is forwarded to a cover server that delivers an unsuspicious looking website. The Honeycomb toolserver receives exfiltrated information from the implant; an operator can also task the implant to execute jobs on the target computer, so the toolserver acts as a C2 (command and control) server for the implant. Similar functionality (though limited to Windows) is provided by the RickBobby project. See the classified user and developer guides for HIVE. &amp;nbsp; **Frequently Asked Questions** &amp;nbsp; **Why now?** WikiLeaks published as soon as its verification and analysis were ready. In Febuary the Trump administration has issued an Executive Order calling for a ""Cyberwar"" review to be prepared within 30 days. While the review increases the timeliness and relevance of the publication it did not play a role in setting the publication date. &amp;nbsp; **Redactions** Names, email addresses and external IP addresses have been redacted in the released pages (70,875 redactions in total) until further analysis is complete. Over-redaction: Some items may have been redacted that are not employees, contractors, targets or otherwise related to the agency, but are, for example, authors of documentation for otherwise public projects that are used by the agency. Identity vs. person: the redacted names are replaced by user IDs (numbers) to allow readers to assign multiple pages to a single author. Given the redaction process used a single person may be represented by more than one assigned identifier but no identifier refers to more than one real person. Archive attachments (zip, tar.gz, ...) are replaced with a PDF listing all the file names in the archive. As the archive content is assessed it may be made available; until then the archive is redacted. Attachments with other binary content are replaced by a hex dump of the content to prevent accidental invocation of binaries that may have been infected with weaponized CIA malware. As the content is assessed it may be made available; until then the content is redacted. The tens of thousands of routable IP addresses references (including more than 22 thousand within the United States) that correspond to possible targets, CIA covert listening post servers, intermediary and test systems, are redacted for further exclusive investigation. Binary files of non-public origin are only available as dumps to prevent accidental invocation of CIA malware infected binaries. &amp;nbsp; **Organizational Chart** The organizational chart corresponds to the material published by WikiLeaks so far. Since the organizational structure of the CIA below the level of Directorates is not public, the placement of the EDG and its branches within the org chart of the agency is reconstructed from information contained in the documents released so far. It is intended to be used as a rough outline of the internal organization; please be aware that the reconstructed org chart is incomplete and that internal reorganizations occur frequently. &amp;nbsp; **Wiki pages** ""Year Zero"" contains 7818 web pages with 943 attachments from the internal development groupware. The software used for this purpose is called Confluence, a proprietary software from Atlassian. Webpages in this system (like in Wikipedia) have a version history that can provide interesting insights on how a document evolved over time; the 7818 documents include these page histories for 1136 latest versions. The order of named pages within each level is determined by date (oldest first). Page content is not present if it was originally dynamically created by the Confluence software (as indicated on the re-constructed page). &amp;nbsp; **FAQ** &amp;nbsp; **What time period is covered?** The years 2013 to 2016. The sort order of the pages within each level is determined by date (oldest first). WikiLeaks has obtained the CIA's creation/last modification date for each page but these do not yet appear for technical reasons. Usually the date can be discerned or approximated from the content and the page order. If it is critical to know the exact time/date contact WikiLeaks. &amp;nbsp; **What is ""Vault 7""** ""Vault 7"" is a substantial collection of material about CIA activities obtained by WikiLeaks. &amp;nbsp; **When was each part of ""Vault 7"" obtained?** Part one was obtained recently and covers through 2016. Details on the other parts will be available at the time of publication. &amp;nbsp; **Is each part of ""Vault 7"" from a different source?** Details on the other parts will be available at the time of publication. &amp;nbsp; **What is the total size of ""Vault 7""?** The series is the largest intelligence publication in history. &amp;nbsp; **How did WikiLeaks obtain each part of ""Vault 7""?** Sources trust WikiLeaks to not reveal information that might help identify them. &amp;nbsp; **Isn't WikiLeaks worried that the CIA will act against its staff to stop the series?** No. That would be certainly counter-productive. &amp;nbsp; **Has WikiLeaks already 'mined' all the best stories?** No. WikiLeaks has intentionally not written up hundreds of impactful stories to encourage others to find them and so create expertise in the area for subsequent parts in the series. They're there. Look. Those who demonstrate journalistic excellence may be considered for early access to future parts. &amp;nbsp; **Won't other journalists find all the best stories before me?** Unlikely. There are very considerably more stories than there are journalists or academics who are in a position to write them."

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but nothing can protect a system from ignorant users. Beyond that they were simple attacks. These weren't nation state super computers massing a DDoS or cracking mega crypted files. They sent them a link telling them to change their pass word. The site recorded the password (old and new) logged in to Gmail, changed their password and owned the account. It is not complicated despite what the media says. Guccifer just guessed hillary's reset questions by doing biographical research. URL John Podesta was a spearphishing attack. URL The DNC was either an insider that released the emails to Wikileaks in which case they had every right to release them as they pleased, or it was a spearphishing attack. Could it have been, as Julian Assange implied, Seth Rich? URL URL The DNC emails were clearly prejudiced against Bernie Sanders. What it really showed was that the DNC were cheating to favor hillary. Their was some other things like Donna Brazille's release of CNN's debate questions. Not much, but it proved the DNC were dirty players. John Podesta's email made him look like a dirt bag, believe in pizzagate or not, some of them are creepy. I do have to ask the Dems, if they were Denny Haster's emails, a known pedophile and Republican, would you call them fake news? hillary's emails, were legally aquired.They were the most damming, and again, if it were a republican, the Dems would be screaming for blood. She can blame the Russians, but the real emails that sank the hillary express were her own. I would also argue that many of the fake news stories have been proven to be correct, and the media were proven partisan protectors of Kamaczar Pantsuit. They were fools. Their still is no evidence proving who did these hacks. Why is it so hard to believe there are cyber security wonks out there that disliked hillary enough to release those emails. In fact why does it have to be one hacker, I'm sure there are thousands out there who would have released that info to prevent hillary from being elected. I would have, I just failed to think of it. The last damming fact is that none of the emails have been refuted. Irregardless of who released them these people still wrote those things. Why isn't that the real issue? Are we, as Americans, really Ok with a government and media that lies to us? Why do Dems defend what was really a gross abuse of their party?

58,cyber crime,The_Donald,"Newest CIA, FBI, NSA Russian Hacking Report Analysis by Me - Full of bullshit, even more than the last ""report"".",18,5mhypt,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5mhypt/newest_cia_fbi_nsa_russian_hacking_report/,2017-01-07 13:29:11,"URL This is the latest assessment by the CIA, FBI and NSA on the allegations of Russian hacking in the election. #Things I find interesting: **1. Every page includes a disclaimer stating this assessment leaves out all key findings.** - The three agencies are declining to release the proof of Russian hacking. **2. Now they call what they previously called Russian hacking, Russian involvement.** - They are saying that because Putin only spoke highly of Trump and instead talked about Hillary's corruption, her email scandals, etc, that Putin had a favorite in mind and did not speak badly about him. 3. **The report is 25 pages long, 5 pages of which talk about what is inside the report (a table of contents if you will, or an index). 3 pages claim with high certainty that Guccifer 2.0 (a hacker that hacked the DNC, revealing the first leaks) is a Russian hacker and not a Romanian hacker like Guccifer 2.0 claimed to be. They base this on the fact that the leaks only targeted the DNC, and Hillary Clinton. 2 pages contain assessments that the RT news agency was the main propaganda tool used to expose the corruption inside the DNC. 7 pages continue to expand on RT, and include pretty infographics showcasing that RT news is the most successful news company in the world, and that it's biggest markets are the USA and the UK. They also assess that RT's continued coverage of Hillary's scandals, emails, investigations, and other less than appealing things are responsible for Trump being able to win the election. This is all Annex A is.** 4. Annex B show cases ""estimative language"" inside the report. The inclusion of this Annex was to explain to the reader that the three phrases, high confidence, moderate confidence and low confidence differ because of the credibility of information collected. However, Annex B also stipulates this assessment was done completely using third party information and that investigations did not take place directly by the hands of the CIA, FBI, and NSA.

Now they call what they previously called Russian hacking, Russian involvement.** - They are saying that because Putin only spoke highly of Trump and instead talked about Hillary's corruption, her email scandals, etc, that Putin had a favorite in mind and did not speak badly about him. 3. **The report is 25 pages long, 5 pages of which talk about what is inside the report (a table of contents if you will, or an index). 3 pages claim with high certainty that Guccifer 2.0 (a hacker that hacked the DNC, revealing the first leaks) is a Russian hacker and not a Romanian hacker like Guccifer 2.0 claimed to be. They base this on the fact that the leaks only targeted the DNC, and Hillary Clinton. 2 pages contain assessments that the RT news agency was the main propaganda tool used to expose the corruption inside the DNC. 7 pages continue to expand on RT, and include pretty infographics showcasing that RT news is the most successful news company in the world, and that it's biggest markets are the USA and the UK. They also assess that RT's continued coverage of Hillary's scandals, emails, investigations, and other less than appealing things are responsible for Trump being able to win the election. This is all Annex A is.** 4. Annex B show cases ""estimative language"" inside the report. The inclusion of this Annex was to explain to the reader that the three phrases, high confidence, moderate confidence and low confidence differ because of the credibility of information collected.

63,cyber crime,The_Donald,DNC HACKINGS: What Everyone Seems to be Missing (It's not Russian Interference). Please Share!,26,5is63f,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5is63f/dnc_hackings_what_everyone_seems_to_be_missing/,2016-12-17 13:03:40,"Is the alleged Russian hacking of the DNC and other political groups in 2015 and 2016 really an attempt to influence the US elections, specifically to get DJT elected, or is it a much more common technique of gathering information on likely foreign leadership to guide strategic policy makers? (Hakems Razor(sp?) says it's the later). Disclaimer: let me say I've lurked and dabbled a tad in commenting on this sub, but at this point I feel I have to speak out with what I know. I don't write on the interwebs much, so it will likely be sloppy/innapropriately faced for reddit, etc. I am a former intelligence official, but am not going to claim I have tons of strategic level experience.... I don't. I was exposed to it for the last 6 months of my career, but by no means will I call myself an expert. However, I have a solid understand of techniques used by most nations, and a fair amount of perspective on our different agencies specialties, mentalities, cultures, etc. Let's dismantle the corporate media's position as led by WAPO (they are the main proponents of this theme, and seem to develop every message that is propogated). That Russia alone hacked and obtained information from several political databases and servers, primarily from the Democrat party, and leaked this information to WikiLeaks through a third party in order to elect DJT and destabilize the US Electoral process. I. Russia likely did hack several political organizations in the US, both with their FSB, Military Intelligence, and through third party organized crime affiliates. The evidence is probably fairly abundant, albeit classified. BUT.... they weren't the only country to do so! Every country with a semi-capable strategic intelligence service collects on the political events and personalities of other nations. Even some semi-honest media sources have admitted that as many as five seperate nations accessed the DNC server in 2015. And this is what is reported at the unclassified level. It is very likely that the real number of foreign intelligence services that penetrated large portions of our political establishment is in the double digits (I can think of seven ""allies"" alone that have the capability and would have done so). So why do foreign nations intelligence services collect on each others elections and political processes? Quite simply, it's to give their decision makers an edge when it comes to confronting that respective nation on the global stage. Policy planners need to plan strategic (national) initiatives far in advance, often years in advance. To do this, they need to know who the leaders will be in the other countries, what their actual thought processes are (their private stances), whom the power brokers are for those foreign leaders (both political and private sector), and what their actual initiatives and agenda is. If they get really lucky, they look for leverage points (ie blackmail) that they can use against power brokers and public officials in these other countries that they can use in negotiations. Like I said before this is commonplace, and frankly smart, as it enables the recipient country of this information to make better decisions, negatiote harder, and avoid unnecessary conflict by knowing potential stress points ahead of time. What info is targeted? Like I mentioned earlier, private positions, power brokers, initiatives, and leverage points are key information that foreign intelligence services seek. They have many ways to get them, cyber intelligence being just one of many. While they will attempt to penetrate the official networks of the target government, foreign intelligence services will often prioritize ""softer"" targets that are easier to gain access to. Private networks, public websites, poorly secured email, are all examples of a soft target to foreign cyber intelligence forces. DNC and RNC servers, news sites, key officials communications, etc would have all been key soft targets that many foreign governments went after (the Russians being just one among many). II. The WAPO accidentally leaked a kernel of truth in some of their latest reporting on the Russian Hacking... they claim that they have a source that thinks the CIA assesses (jesus what a tenous chain of evidence to base a story on) that the Russian affiliated cyber actors ""prioritized"" the Democrats during their efforts. Why would this be? Is it because they wanted to help DJT, or was it because they also believed that Hillary was going to win the presidency. Analysts, money makers, and foreign leaders the world over believed she would win, and its almost certain that Russian policy makers would have thought the same thing. So if you had limited resources to devote to trying to gather information on who you thought your next likely foreign counterpart would be, would you spend all your time on who you thought was going to lose, or who was going to win? DUH. It almost doesn't need explaining, but of course the foreign intel services were all focusing efforts on Hillary, the DNC, and the ENORMOUS web of political influencer, think tanks, lobbyists, consultants, etc that were supporting the transition of power from Pres. Obama to his designated successor. ...It's made worse when the assumed loser has almost no digital activity, and has an organization that is far smaller than the dominant party, and that is eschewed by most of the traditional political organizations that intel services would likely have pre-existing collection efforts already focused on. III. It is highly unlikely that Russia intelligence, or any russian third party organized crime affiliates, leaked what they had to Wikileaks. First, there is the large amount of direct sources that say the leakers were not russian affiliated, both from Wikileaks itself, and from our own intelligence services. Second, it would not be in the Russians best interest to leak the information they likely obtained to the public sphere. Going back to the main point that the information obtained by a foreign intel service is to be used to aid their policy makers at the strategic level, it makes no sense to release all the information prior to it being useful. The huge amount of corruption uncovered at the DNC, clinton foundation, etc would have made great leverage points for the Russians and every other nation that succeeded in obtaining that info. If it's public, it serves no purpose as they can't hold it over their future rivals head behind closed doors (this is done more frequently, albeit more politely, than you probably imagine). The amount of information that was disclosed on the key power brokers within the Clinton camp, their likely political nominees, and the private positions that were held by Clinton and her financers are also much more useful when only the recipient nation knows them and can make prescient moves based off of them. Letting other nations know what they know weakens this info, since all nations will be making similar moves to anticipate us. Public intelligence information is useless intelligence information... hence why we classify information in the first place. Conclusion: It's much more likely that the Russians, along with many other foreign intelligence services hacked the democrats in order to gain leverage on whom they thought would be the future POTUS, and all of them kept the information they gathered (far more than we saw during the election) as secret as possible. The leaks that did come out were from a rogue actor that personnaly wanted to see the democrat power structure removed from power, very likely an internal source, as the Wikileaks and others have stated. Russia had no incentive to try to interfere in our election, as they already know they can out-maneuver our current political class (look at the last 9 years), and likely had a substantial amount of information on the projected winner. Any agency that tries to draw any other conclusion is using faulty, politically driven analysis; I personnaly would tell them to give me their sources because they are f---ing retarded if I was still in my old job. Again just my humble perspective. Please share if this helped shed some light on things or challenge what you thought about the current fiasco centipedes. I appreciate your feedback as well. "

Please read, upvote, and share!",186,5ao9d7,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ao9d7/plain_english_summary_of_the_fbi_doc_drop_please/,2016-11-02 16:33:02,"Please read if you have a moment. I just spent two hours after an 11 or so hour day rendering the FBI release on the last investigation on the Clinton server into plain English. It's very...interesting: EDIT: Haha, I'm already getting downvoted by someone! I've been reading through the FBI doc drop on the Clinton case. 10 pages in, and the report has already made it clear that Clinton herself lied to the FBI about the State department knowing she used a private email server. She stated that it was clear from the email address, but State employees testified that no such address was included in the emails, being replaced by ""H"". Most State employees were completely unaware that Clinton used a private server. This is a crime. She also made no attempt to request permission to utilize a private server, despite her obligation to do so. There were actually three consecutive servers: the first, Apple server, with no intrusion recording or protection, the second, Pagliano server - with minimal intrusion protection and massive vulnerabilities such as Remote Desktop Access, and the third, PRN, server, which was not located in Clinton's house. As well, the FBI cannot determine whether the servers were definitively compromised, but was able to determine that several of the devices emailing to-and-from the server WERE compromised by cyber attack. As well, it appears that there was virtually no major protection used on the original Apple server in Clinton's house, and almost none on the server that replaced it in Clinton's house, until the private email system was finally moved to an offsite, still-private third server location. Keep in mind that Martha Stewart went to jail for lying once. About her investments. More: Even some of Clinton's closest aides testified that they did not know about the server. And when two State information management staff became aware of and sought to discuss the server with higher authority, they were told to never speak of it again. It appears that one reason Clinton may have used the server was to avoid Freedom Of Information Act requests. It also appears that it may have been used to avoid maintaining records at all: State department policy required private email accounts to record all State business done over email with the State department, and use of State hardware would have meant that such information would be copied automatically if the specified methodology was used. By using a private server, Clinton could communicate about classified material and State business without any oversight or record of it being available to the government. It also would have allowed anyone using the private server to communicate classified material to un-cleared persons with no record being made. It is also stated that Clinton often brought and stored her Blackberry within the classified zones at State, wherein no non-classified internet/phone-capable device was to be used, in order to preserve network security, among other things, one presumes. Clinton aide Abedin claimed that Clinton would go out to a balcony to use her blackberry (one of 11). So far, it has been impossible to determine if Clinton sent or received classified information on her private servers, because the files were frequently wiped to ""save room"". This despite the fact that Clinton was obligated to provide copies of emails sent and received to the State Department. Only emails from the last two servers, presumably, were available. Before these were provided to State, Clinton's attorneys reviewed the emails and destroyed those they deemed not ""work-related"", without running them by the State Department, ensuring no oversight. The backups of the second server at the Clinton house, used to prepare some of these emails were then ""lost"". The FBI also determined that some of these emails from the last two servers were NOT transferred to the State Department, and that some were of [SECRET] Or [CONFIDENTIAL] classification. Some time afterwards, a program called ""Bleachbit"" was used to destroy all relevant data on the servers, and on the laptops of [REDACTED]. The FBI identified several classified email chains (conversations) conducted on insecure systems based on other devices and on emails recovered, however, 61 of the 81 known email chains could not be recovered, due to being deleted. These chains included [TOP SECRET] clearance, the highest classification. Clinton herself used her email in at least 11 of the classified email chains. Seven of the email chains on Clinton's server were [TOP SECRET]. There is also a black period of 4 days from the third server, with no emails recovered involving Clinton. the FBI believes this may be a result of intentional deletion. There is also evidence that unauthorized users attempted to hack the second (Pagliano) server, and an unauthorized user appears to have accessed it while using Tor software (a utility for rendering oneself untraceable). * * * Hopefully this is informative. My thoughts on this: This is, at best, recklessly criminal conduct in regards to classified information, and almost certain resulted in the loss of classified information, given that there was an intrusion into one of the servers by an unknown, origin-masked agent. Even I, who know very little about classification, would not dream of doing something like this. More worryingly, it appears that this set-up may well have been used to either provide an opportunity for an outside agent to be provided classified material, or to conceal and destroy the actions of Clinton during a portion of her time as Secretary of State.

He outlined exactly what was going to happen his first 100 days in office.,7,5c3l4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5c3l4e/remember_trumps_gettysburg_speech_he_outlined/,2016-11-10 07:43:46,"Therefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC: FIRST, propose a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress; SECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health); THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated; FOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service; FIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government; SIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. On the same day, I will begin taking the following seven actions to protect American workers: FIRST, I will announce my intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205 SECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator FOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately FIFTH, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. SIXTH, lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward SEVENTH, cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix Americas water and environmental infrastructure Additionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law: FIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama SECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States THIRD, cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities FOURTH, begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that wont take them back FIFTH, suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting. Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration: 1. Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate. 2. End The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free. 3. American Energy &amp; Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral. 4. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable. 5. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications. 6. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-side childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families. 7. End Illegal Immigration Act Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first. 8. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars. 9. Restoring National Security Act. Rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester and expanding military investment; provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice; protects our vital infrastructure from cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values 10. Clean up Corruption in Washington Act. Enacts new ethics reforms to Drain the Swamp and reduce the corrupting influence of special interests on our politics. On November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government. This is my pledge to you. And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people. URL"
73,cyber crime,The_Donald,Trump 100 Day Action Plan,4,5c40dp,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5c40dp/trump_100_day_action_plan/,2016-11-10 08:55:56,"What follows is my 100 day action plan to make America great again. Its a contract between Donald J. Trump and the American voter, and it begins with bringing honesty, accountability, and change to Washington D.C. Therefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington. First, a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. Second, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition, exempting military, public safety, and public health. Third, a requirement that for every new federal regulation two existing regulations must be eliminated. Regulations are killing our country and our jobs. Fourth, a five-year ban on White House and congressional officials from becoming lobbyists after they leave government service making a fortune. Fifth, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government. Sixth, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. Its whats happening. On the same day, I will begin taking  really taking strongly  seven actions to protect American workers. Our American workers have been treated so badly by politicians that dont have their interests at heart. And were going to change that and were going to change that very, very fast. First, I will announce my intention to totally renegotiate NAFTA  one of the worst deals our country has ever made signed by Bill Clinton  or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205. Second, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership  a potential disaster for our country. Third, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator. China is a currency manipulator. What they have done to us by playing currency is very sad. And I dont blame them. Theyve been very smart. I blame our politicians for letting this take place. So easy to stop. So easy to stop. Fourth, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. trade representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately. Fifth, very importantly, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas, and clean coal. And we will put our miners back to work. Sixth, I will lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks that allowed this vital energy infrastructure projects to go forward. We have roadblocks like you have never ever seen  environmental blocks, structural blocks. Were going to allow the Keystone Pipeline and so many other things to move forward. Tremendous number of jobs and good for our country. Were going to cancel billions in payments to the United Nationss climate change programs and use them to fix Americas water and environmental infrastructure. Were paying billions and billions and billions of dollars. Were going to fix our own environment. Additionally on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and constitutional rule of law. We have to do that. Cancel every unconstitutional executive action memorandum and order issued by President Obama. Second, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia, whose wife by the way has a Trump sign. His wife is a phenomenal woman. Has a Trump sign in her front yard. Isnt that nice? I just found that out this morning. Boom. Isnt that nice? He was great. From one of the 20 judges on my list. You know were going to make great decisions from 20 outstanding judges on a list that we submitted who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. Third, we will cancel all federal funding of sanctuary cities. Fourth, we will begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country. These are drug dealers, gang heads, gang members, killers. And cancel visas to foreign countries that wont taken them back. And when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State and they had someone who was bad  really bad  and they brought him back to the country and the country wouldnt take him, she said, Well, bring him back. We dont want to force the country to take him. There wont be one such instance if I become president. Believe me. Were going to suspend immigration from terror prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. And if you look at Syria and the migration, were taking in thousands and thousands of people into our country. We have no idea who they are, what their thought process is, where do they come from. And Hillary Clinton wants to increase the number of those thousands and thousands currently pouring in by 550%. Radical Islamic terror is right around the corner. We have to be so tough, so smart, so vigilant. We cant allow that to happen. We have enough problems. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting. We will be very careful. Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my administration. Middle class tax relief and simplification act, an economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% a year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. We need that so badly. Jobs. We need jobs. Our jobs have left us. Our good jobs have really left us. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class, who have been forgotten. Its called the forgotten man and woman. They have been forgotten. The middle class with family of two children will get basically approximately a 35% tax cut and thats what they can use and that money will go back into the economy. The current number of brackets will be reduced from seven to three, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35% to 15% and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10% rate. Its stuck. We cant bring it back  $2.5 trillion to $5 trillion. Companies cant get it back into the country. Some companies are actually leaving not only because taxes are so high but because they cant get their money. And they are actually leaving to get their money. We are going to simplify that. Were going to have them bring the money back into our country and use the money and spend the money on building our country. End the offshoring act, establish tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate to other countries and ship their products back to the United States tax free. They leave the United States like Carrier, like Ford, like so many others. They leave the United States. They fire all of their employees. They go to Mexico or another country. They build a beautiful brand new plant. They hire other people. They then take their air conditioners, their cars, whatever theyre making, they send it tax free across what will be a very strong border. Believe me. But they send it tax free across the border and what do we end up with? We have unemployment, tremendous losses, and we have none of the benefits. So we will establish tariffs that when they do that, there will be consequences. Well work with them. Well be nice. Well be fair. But there has to be consequences. And when they know there are consequences, our companies will stop leaving the United States and going to other countries. The American infrastructure act leverages public private partnerships and private investments through tax incentives to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over the next 10 years. Our infrastructure is in such trouble. Weve doubled our national debt to $20 trillion under President Obama. In less than 8 years, $10 trillion has been added. Think of it. And we havent fixed anything. We havent fixed anything. What have we done? Our roads are broken. Our bridges, our tunnels, our hospitals, our schools. And we have $20 trillion in debt  all time high. Thats true. Our VA hospitals are in bad shape and our VA is in very, very bad shape. And we will fix that. We are going to work on fixing that because our veterans have not been treated properly. We have illegal immigrants that are treated far better in many instances than our veterans and were not going to have that. School choice and education opportunity act redirects education dollars to give parents the right to send their kids, their children, to public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home schools of their choice. And so importantly, were going to end Common Core and bring education supervision to local communities. We do so badly on education. If you look at the lists and you see Sweden, Norway, Denmark, different countries at the top, you see us at the bottom. And yet, by far, per pupil more money than anybody and its not even close. We spend more money per pupil than anybody. Not even close. Were at the bottom of the list. Other countries spending far less per pupil are at the top of the list. So obviously, our current system is not working. We will change it and we will make it good. It expands vocational and technical education, which weve totally forgotten about in this country, and make two and four year colleges more affordable. Have you ever gone to school and youve been with people who arent good students but they can fix and engine or they can build a wall or they can do things you wouldnt even think about? Because we can use some of the ones who build the wall. Were going to need them. Were going to need them. But did you ever see that? How theyre genius at fixing a car. They can do anything. But history? Not so good. Physics? Not so good. We have to open vocational again. Those are the people. These are great people. The repeal and replace Obamacare act. Fully repeal Obamacare and replace it with health savings accounts. And we can do that. The health savings account  its one way  there are numerous ways. But this is one very good way. The ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, which we have to do because thats competition. The politicians wont let go of it because the insurance companies, they dont want competition. But well open it up. Believe me. Well get rid of that. Ive been saying it for years. And let states manage Medicaid funds. It will be so good. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA. There are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications. Theyre looking at drugs that are looking very good and you have terminal patients. That its over. These people. Theyre dying. They want to get the drug. They wont be living much longer. And we study it for years and years. At some point, they have to do what they have to do. They have to do it properly. But we have 4,000 different drugs and products waiting in line for approval and we cant get them approved. Were going to speed up that process very significantly. Affordable child care and elder care act allows Americans to deduct child care and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site  so important  child care services. And you see that with a couple of companies and its such a great thing to see. And creates tax-free dependent care savings accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families. So good. End illegal immigration act fully funds the construction of a wall on our southern border. Dont worry about it. Remember, I said Mexico is paying for the wall. With the full understanding that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a wall. Okay? Were going to have the wall. Mexicos going to pay for the wall. Mexicos  by the way, I met with the president of Mexico 2.5 months ago. Wonderful meeting. Wonderful person. But I told him its a two-way highway, not a one-way highway. We have our people. We have to take care of our people. We have to protect our people. So its got to be a two way street. Otherwise, its going to be a whole different deal. But it establishes a two-year mandatory minimum prison sentences if people coming in illegally for illegally re-entering the United States after a previous deportation and a five-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions, or two or more prior deportations. So when somebody comes in, we send them out. They come back in. They go to prison for quite a while. They come back. They come back again? They go five years. Because whats happening is theyre coming back 10 times, and I could go case after case. They come back. Look at what happened in San Francisco. Five times he came back. On the fifth time, he killed Kate [Steinle]. Five times. But so many others  one 10 times came back. Killed somebody after 10 times. When they get deported, they stay out. Otherwise, they have very serious prison terms. They will stay out. Once you do that, they will stay out. Right now, they have no consequence. They have no consequences. Also reforms on visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first. Number eight, restoring community safety act reduces surging crimes, drugs, and violence by creating a task force on violent crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist your local police, who are doing such a great job. Believe me. Increase the resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars or out of our country and into the country where they came from. Restoring national security act, which rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester, which has been very tough on our military, and expanding military investment. Now, at no time practically do we need a military like right now. We dont want to use it. But its peace through strength. We need a strong military. Our military is so terribly depleted. It also provides our great veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend a private doctor of their choice. If theyre waiting on line  and I have the plan up and weve gotten as you know tremendous support from veterans, from law enforcement, from veterans, from the military. Tremendous support. But if theyre waiting on line, and you see it  22 suicides a day. People dont even believe it. 22 a day. But if theyre waiting on line for seven days, six days, nine days, they cant get to see a doctor and a simple procedure or a simple prescription can solve their problem and they become very sick and they die. They die waiting in line. Were going to give them the power to go across the street to a local doctor, a private doctor, a public hospital or a private hospital, all looking to help and all looking to do business. And well pay the bill. So much cheaper but much more importantly, the veterans will finally be taken care of properly because what theyre going through now is unacceptable. Also, were going to protect our vital infrastructure from the new thing  its called cyber attack. It establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values. We want people that love our country or can love our country and people that will love our citizens. We want people that can love us. And there are ways through talent of determining that, and countries do but we dont. Just come on in, folks. Come on in. Clean up corruption in Washington act enacts tough new ethic reforms to reduce the corrupting influence of special interests and donors on our politics. On Nov. 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our country, secure our communities, and honesty to our government. "

Beaten the political establishment. Opened up restoring relations with Russia and Syria. The DOW hits a record high. He made progress with President Obama and wants to work with him many, many times. Reconciled with Speaker of the House and has set plans to get started on day one. Many foreign politicians are excited to work with the United States for the better of us all, And others have now realized America is not going to fall on trade any more. Canada and Mexico have said they are willing to renegotiate NAFTA. Some of our strongest allies are ready to work with this historical new shift. The first three members of his administration team are Kellyanne Conway (a woman), Peter Theil (a gay man), and Dr. Ben Carson (an African American). Consider that the media lied about more than just the polls. He has the support of our military, police, and border patrol including many more. He had the largest minority support of any republican candidate, ever. His 100 day plan lays out his contract with the American people. **On day 1 he will immediately pursuing:** A constitutional amendment to impose term limits to all of Congress, a hiring freeze on the fed, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated, a five-year ban on White House and Congress officials becoming lobbyists and a life time ban on them becoming lobbyists on behalf of a foreign government, announce the renegotiation of NAFTA, withdraw from the TPP, direct the secretary of treasury to label China a currency manipulator, direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately. **Within the first 100 days he plans to work with congress on broader legislative measures**. **Middle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act** An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with two children will get a 35% tax cut.

American Energy and Infrastructure Act Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over ten years. It is revenue neutral. **School Choice and Education Opportunity Act** Redirects education dollars to give parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice.

All Americans owe it to themselves to at least read WikiLeaks and understand what has been going on. Trump did not have to run for office. He had everything a person could ever want as a successful billionaire, yet decided to go through the grinder to fix what he saw as theft of the American Dream by the globalists. The threat he posed to the establishment is the reason why you were spoon-fed crap for the last 16 months on the true nature of Trump's candidacy. If I believed everything CNN, NBC, ABC, and the MSM tried to shove down our throat I wouldn't vote for him either. Trump did not win due to poor uneducated rural whites who don't know any better. People from all walks of life voted for who they thought will finally end the decades of Bush/Clinton dynasty that siphoned and abused the hard-working American's future. Whites, Blacks, Latinos, Asians and even the LGBT community voted for this man who truly has one task in mind; which is to TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK from the elite ruling class. Donald Trump doesn't represent just Republicans. He represents Americans. We cannot have a nation without borders. We cannot have a nation when businesses are choked out and unable to compete due to regulation and taxes. We definitely can't have a nation when the corrupt ruling class continues to use the revolving door at will at our expense. This is the reason to support Donald Trump. This is the reason Americans voted for him. I ask everyone to respect the votes and will of the American people and give this man a chance. I look to a day when people will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.  Martin Luther King Jr. "
75,cyber crime,The_Donald,2024 (A Glance Into The Future),5,5ckupm,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ckupm/2024_a_glance_into_the_future/,2016-11-13 02:30:14,"I turned over to glance out my window. the sky, a dimly lit grey, as it was seemingly every day. The sun never quite breaking through to grace us with its brilliant glow. I shift my gaze over to the clock. 7:00 The numbers glare at me in their bright red color. It was time to get ready, time to get up and start preparing for my mandatory 12 hour work day. I cant believe it had been 5 years already since that damned law had been put into place. 5 long, gruesome years, 15,651 hours of hard labor. I went through the rituals, shower, get dressed, eat breakfast. I made my way down the street, averting my eyes away from those heinous posters, the posters that glorify the one who has caused us all this suffering. I opened my phone to look at my bank account. It was a habit. Every Thursday I would look, to see if maybe once they would get it wrong and forget to pay me or give me an incorrect amount. But it was always there at 12:01 am on the dot. After all it was a crime of the highest order to wrongfully withhold payment. As I approached the factory I could nearly taste the thickness in the air. Ft Worth has had quite a spike in pollution since the industrial boom of 2019. Many cities have. It was the year the Nation went into war production again. We had to. I entered the factory at 7:49. I sat and watched the morning news, It was always the same though. Same stocks were talked up. Same rebuilding efforts were mentioned across the globe. Its ironic. They make such an effort to help rebuild the areas they just bombed back to the stone age. At 7:58 I went to the time clock and waited to punch in along with all of my co-workers. Punching in too early or too late was something that was severely frowned upon. Something to avoid at all costs. After clocking in we made our way to our designated daily education centers. The first 2 hours of our work day were spent on learning. Grown men and women, forced to sit in classrooms like children all across the country. We were taught by these ""professionals"" how to manage our money, how the economy should run and be successful. On Wednesdays and every other Friday we learned about the Third Great War, and why it was a necessary event. We were taught how to learn from the mistakes of the past and to ensure it never happened again. The story goes. That our rivals, could no longer be trusted to maintain stable economies and that it damaged regional and worldwide security. We learn about how the siege of London and the Bombings of Beijing. They show us weekly videos of the rebuilding efforts in Europe, remnants of buildings that were wiped out during the Unified Islamists retaliation. They show us how lucky and privileged we are that the American mainland remained almost untouched by all of this conflict. The war lasted for around 2 years. Although many say it started before the first shots had even been fired. They argue the constant Cyber Attacks were the beginning of the war. Some even say it started with the events in the Ukraine, and escalated with Syria and Israel. We learn why our 12 hour work days are necessary and how important the industrial boom was in helping win the war. We watched as our less prepared allies were beaten and when the time came, it was the machines and weapons built in these factories that saved them and the world. Our newly found cooperation with Russia and Supreme Commander Putin proved effective. The joint northern armies quickly put to rest any hope of a victory against us. Our president was even honored in Moscow, given the highest honor a foreigner could receive. That was occasionally entertaining for a while. But on other days however we are re-educated on how to spend properly, and how important investing in the economy and local businesses is. I will admit that since these mandates came into place, I have never had more money, and have not worried once about where Id be sleeping tonight, or if I would have food to eat. But there is no time to enjoy any of it. The 60 hour work weeks start wearing on you after a while. None of us find the energy to complain though. we are all complacent. After all we did vote for this. We voted for all of it. All when we voted the Donald into office. I often wonder, while I stare into the bleak and polluted sky. How different could things have been? Could all of this been avoided? I guess I'll never know. *-An apocalyptic outlook on the trump presidency, please don't kill me.-*"
76,cyber crime,The_Donald,IN HIS FIRST THREE DAYS AS PRESIDENT ELECT,6,5clye4,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5clye4/in_his_first_three_days_as_president_elect/,2016-11-13 06:22:25,"**In his first three days as President Elect Donald Trump has:** Ended two political dynastys in 16 months. Beaten the political establishment. Opened up restoring relations with Russia and Syria. The DOW hits a record high. He made progress with President Obama and wants to work with him many, many times. Reconciled with Speaker of the House and has set plans to get started on day one. Many foreign politicians are excited to work with the United States for the better of us all, And others have now realized America is not going to fall on trade any more. Canada and Mexico have said they are willing to renegotiate NAFTA. Some of our strongest allies are ready to work with this historical new shift. The first three members of his administration team are Kellyanne Conway (a woman), Peter Theil (a gay man), and Dr. Ben Carson (an African American). Consider that the media lied about more than just the polls. He has the support of our military, police, and border patrol including many more. He had the largest minority support of any republican candidate, ever. His 100 day plan lays out his contract with the American people. **On day 1 he will immediately pursuing:** A constitutional amendment to impose term limits to all of Congress, a hiring freeze on the fed, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated, a five-year ban on White House and Congress officials becoming lobbyists and a life time ban on them becoming lobbyists on behalf of a foreign government, announce the renegotiation of NAFTA, withdraw from the TPP, direct the secretary of treasury to label China a currency manipulator, direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately. **Within the first 100 days he plans to work with congress on broader legislative measures**. **Middle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act** An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with two children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from seven to three, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35% to 15%, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10% rate. **End the Offshoring Act** Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free. American Energy and Infrastructure Act Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over ten years. It is revenue neutral. **School Choice and Education Opportunity Act** Redirects education dollars to give parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends Common Core and brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and makes two- and four-year college more affordable. **Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act** Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications. **Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act** Allows Americans to deduct childcare and eldercare from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services and creates tax-free dependent care savings accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families. **End Illegal Immigration Act** Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a two-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a five-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first. **Restoring Community Safety Act** Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a task force on violent crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars. **Restoring National Security Act** Rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester and expanding military investment; provides veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice; protects our vital infrastructure from cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values. **Clean Up Corruption in Washington Act** Enacts new ethics reforms to drain the swamp and reduce the corrupting influence of special interests on our politics. All Americans owe it to themselves to at least read WikiLeaks and understand what has been going on. Trump did not have to run for office. He had everything a person could ever want as a successful billionaire, yet decided to go through the grinder to fix what he saw as theft of the American Dream by the globalists. The threat he posed to the establishment is the reason why you were spoon-fed crap for the last 16 months on the true nature of Trump's candidacy. If I believed everything CNN, NBC, ABC, and the MSM tried to shove down our throat I wouldn't vote for him either. Trump did not win due to poor uneducated rural whites who don't know any better. People from all walks of life voted for who they thought will finally end the decades of Bush/Clinton dynasty that siphoned and abused the hard-working American's future. Whites, Blacks, Latinos, Asians and even the LGBT community voted for this man who truly has one task in mind; which is to TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK from the elite ruling class. Donald Trump doesn't represent just Republicans. He represents Americans. We cannot have a nation without borders. We cannot have a nation when businesses are choked out and unable to compete due to regulation and taxes. We definitely can't have a nation when the corrupt ruling class continues to use the revolving door at will at our expense. This is the reason to support Donald Trump. This is the reason Americans voted for him. I ask everyone to respect the votes and will of the American people and give this man a chance. I look to a day when people will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.  Martin Luther King Jr. "
77,cyber crime,The_Donald,Serious: Paul Combetta = Monica Lewinsky ?,3,543frj,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/543frj/serious_paul_combetta_monica_lewinsky/,2016-09-23 16:26:59,"Older, Retired network engineer here. I feel kinda bad for Paul Combetta, here's why: .. First he's a computer guy, we tend to be a tad socially awkward, cyber years is something like dawg years x12, so years reading manuals, tweaking code etc, doesn't leave much time for Real life experience. .. He had a decent job with a company and obviously doing field work, which is an exploitative type job, but it's better to have the variety of many sites to work at and new faces where you are the hero, than sitting in a cube farm. So I presume he was doing at least ok. .. Then he gets approached for a gig working for a VERY VIP senator/ S.o.S., I mean who would pass at THAT job and being able to slide that onto your resume and references !?! .. Like most tech jobs/field work, you DO what the client/customer asks. .. If anything is sketchy you ask them and/or your bosses, and I would bet in this case he was assured it was all on the up and up. He was a young man, in the tech world you hear of High profile .MIL gigs but they FIRST credential you, then actually look over your shoulder the WHOLE time you are DOING the work, just to impress upon you the seriousness of the confidentiality. .. I would BET NONE of this occurred in setting up a dumb simple mail server Nor later in Maintaining it. .. Later when they were dealing with hacks and manipulating mail data, I would bet they still maintained that it was low key and nothing major other than the normal ""keep it secret, keep it safe"" precautions you would take with private computing. .. I would go further to say that this is what his mindset was WHEN he was asking questions of Reddit tech subs, while using the very same Reddit user account he ""played"" with for his YIFFY life LOL... .. Just trying to accomplish a tech goal requested by the people he was gigging for. .. I am sure they did NOT tell him it was for obstruction of Justice, nor destruction of evidence in a pending case, it was private data even IF the client was a VERY VIP person. .. THEN .. .. The Shit hits the fan, he is asshole deep in intrigue, questioned by the FBI, Subpoenaed by Congress, and hounded by international press. THAT has to be overwhelming for a young tech guy in the BEST of circumstances. He was certainly NOT making the $ to afford spin-meisters, Nor the Shockingly expensive legal representation that he did have. * Who knows where/how he found his lawyers. Did Hillary or one of her goons recommend them ? * They could be regular flavor lawyers with some experience, and they could be looking at him as a goldmine of future firm building experience. * so IS he getting what he SHOULD be getting for advice ? .. I'd say NO, one simply does NOT ignore a congressional sopena, Nor does one simply NOT show up. .. Killery Et Al. could have convinced him that HE was going to be the one to take the fall. .. They could have given him the ole you're an accomplice now, so you have to hide this or go down with us, but don't worry we got you covered and if we all stick to the narrative it will be fine. .. He MAY have even believed that, at least for a while and it became apparent that wait.. Nope.. I just setup and maintained a box and maybe did some deleting at their adamant request, but the crime was HERS/THEIRS... .. Ultimately when the FBI and CONGRESS COME KNOCKING, your legal team at least impresses upon you that this is Much bigger than a neato mail server gig. MAKING those appearences, and having the cameras click and the whirlwind of press sets it in stone. .. What worries me is that he's a young guy, who thought he had a dream tech Gig, and now he is tied to the clinton corruption, has had his private life destroyed, his piccadillos exposed and mocked even if it was just play, and now is in contempt of Congress. .. * That last bit, contempt of congress, has me wondering WHO the FUCK is advising him ? * How do you continue on with your career after that ? * What Tech company is ever going to touch you ? .. Further, with nobody knowing his whereabouts, and knowing the Clinton Killing machine is now erasing people in ACTIVE cases, there is a very real probability that he is in fear for his life, or already suicided with 5 shots to the back of his head. .. While it's great that /r/The_Donald found his account and history and raised it to a national level and attention. Let us remember that this is a real person, a nerd/geek Redditor like most of us, that got sucked into the Clinton Life Destruction Machine as a useful perhaps gullible idiot. .. Joke all you want, however Like Monica, we can perhaps excuse youthful missteps of exuberance, but we have to remember the REAL issue is * CLINTON. .. MY advice to him is to contact Donald TRUMP ! * Donald has the connections and $ to protect him, * He Can help get his legal issues dealt with-he will have to pay his dues as that is actually part of setting the record straight. * He will literally save his life. Later, he can also get a book/expose' and maybe even a movie deal out of it. That will give him some breathing room to figure out a life after tech... .. Alternatively, contact Alex Jones or Paul Joseph Watson, bring his face &amp; issue wide open to the public Fight fire with fire, don't remain obscure object of ridicule and scapegoat, raise the stakes ! At least then if he has a barbell ""accident"" the mounting evidence will eventually bring Justice... if justice exists anymore in this world. Amiright ?!

79,cyber crime,The_Donald,On the first presidential debate,6,54tpfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/54tpfu/on_the_first_presidential_debate/,2016-09-28 10:18:42,"Just one man's opinion on the action last night: I thought it went well for Trump. The first 30 minutes of the debate were spent on the economy which was clearly the largest topic of the night. I thought he beat her in that segment in every metric you can think of and things were going very well for him at that point. From there on, things seemed to slightly swing in clintons favor, mostly due to the questions posed by moderator Lester Holt. I didn't think either of them won the race relations topic. All Hillary did was call trump a racist (twice) and all Donald did was say we needed more law and order. The proceeding discussion on crime related to that felt like a wash as well. The fact that birtherism was even discussed in a presidential debate that is supposed to focus on the future of America is fucking ridiculous but that's just a result of a left leaning moderator. Obviously that segment didn't go great for trump and neither did the one where he was questioned about his tax returns and businesses and these came off very damaging for trump. Hillary hit trump personally multiple times throughout this 30-40 minute part of the debate and he, for some reason unbeknownst to me, wouldn't hit back. Hillary put him on the defensive which is not a place trump usually operates from and I think most people could feel that and it was the biggest factor is clinton's success. Trump missed huge opportunities here because even though Lester holt refused to ask her about her scandals, trump still had opportunities to attack her hard on her emails and even Benghazi which voters have not forgotten about. But he didn't so these segments were won by Hillary. During the cyber security segment, neither candidate sounded like they knew what they were talking about and neither made any interesting points in my opinion, but this was yet another missed opportunity for trump to slam Hillary on the fact that she and the private email server she used as secretary of state were the biggest threat to American cyber security in the nation. Finally the debate came back to a real issue we are facing in the form of ISIS. Hillary said trump doesn't have a plan to defeat isis but the only details she gave us about her plan was that she wanted to ""attack the leaders of isis."" Trump I think won this segment by pointing out that she was the Secretary of State during the huge growth period of isis mostly formed by the vacuum of power created by Hillary in Iraq and Libya. However, he should have hit harder on the domestic issues caused by isis and how he was the proponent for safety within our borders. I'm still not sure why a question about domestic safety was not asked or why immigration was left out of the night completely but again that's all on Lester holt, not the candidates. Clinton seemed more prepared than trump but that might be what happens when trump is on the campaign trail all week while she stayed home to memorize her responses and quips. I wouldn't disagree with anyone who believes Clinton won the debate, but on the topics that actually matter to most Americans, I can't help but feel trump came out on top. Although it doesn't have to do with last night, I'm very interested to see what happens at the next two debates where one is set up in a town hall format where things like Benghazi, hillary's emails, and trump university will almost certainly be brought up by audience members, and the third debate where Chris Wallace will moderate and immigration will certainly be one of the biggest subjects. Because of the moderation formatting, it seems likely that Trump will gain momentum back in the coming debates."

There are 70 days remaining until the presidential election, and after the results are counted, America will be a tinderbox ready to explode no matter who wins. What follows is an educated analysis of the political friction now escalating in America. Note carefully that nothing in this article should be construed as any intention to call for violence of any kind. I do reference such acts, however, as part of human history as well as likely outcomes in our near future. What I'm offering here is an analysis and a warning, along with a call to prepare for what's coming. If Trump wins, the left goes full terror As I've publicly predicted numerous times over the last year, if Donald Trump wins, the radical extreme leftists go on a violent rampage that leads to the rest of us begging for martial law. After half a dozen cities burn with riots and looting, Trump invokes a national emergency, deploying National Guard troops across the most devastated urban areas, and the radical left finds itself in a shooting war with the government. If Hillary Clinton wins, all the Trump supporters who have been violently assaulted, spat upon and physically attacked by the radical left un-holster their concealed weapons and start shooting back. This quickly escalates into open warfare between lunatic leftist Hillary supporters and armed Trump ""Second Amendment"" people who basically figure they've got nothing left to lose anyway, so why not fight to save America? This was all pointed out in an insightful reader comment posted to The Burning Platform on August 29th: With the rise of Donald Trump, the plan of the political elites has been to provoke violence and blame it on him, thus scaring the normal populace. Early-on there were the road-blockings, the threatened riots, the cancelled events in Chicago and Cincinnati, the beatings, the police ordered to ""look the other way""and it has continued: The screaming harassment and physical attacks on Trump supporters as they leave his rallies. The spitting. The intimidation. The thrown eggs. The shoves and punches. The cars blocked and damaged. The hats snatched off people's heads, stomped on, and then burned on the ground... The people who support Trump are increasingly well-armed, and increasingly seething with justifiable rage. For now they hold back. Donald Trump himself has repeatedly observed that ""the safest place in America"" for anti-Trump protesters is at Trump rallies. And that is true. For now (except for the one old cowboy who punched out the protester, he was an octogenarian outlier). Why is this? Why the docility in the face of clear provocation? It is because Trump supporters understand that any retaliatory violence now will be instantly, widely, and incessantly portrayed by the whorish mainstream media as proof that ""Trump is dangerous"" and ""Trump's movement is violent"" and ""Trump invites violence."" So his supporters endure the abuse. They endure the spittle. They endure the shoves and punches. They endure the theft of their possessions. They endure the damaged cars and the incessant harassment. For now, for the sake of their political movement and the candidacy of Donald Trump, they do not strike back... But what happens after the election? It matters not who wins. If Hillary Clinton is elected, by hook or by crook, the mass movement harnessed by Donald Trump will be free to respond to physical attacks. If Donald Trump wins the Presidency, there will similarly be no reason to continue to endure physical attacks and humiliations by the street thugs of the Democrats. Whether Trump or Hillary Clinton is in the White House, there will be no reason to hold back. Hundreds of millions of guns across America are now in the hands of people who are fed up with being stomped on, ridiculed and marginalized by a corrupt leftist regime that's destroying America Do the math on this one: You've got 44% of U.S. households that now own guns (and not just one gun each, but several different types of guns). Over the last 8 years, President Obama's anti-gun rhetoric has resulted in the largest surge of gun sales to private citizens ever recorded in American history. As a result of Obama's criminal efforts to try to destroy the Second Amendment via false flag operations such as Operation Fast and Furious, more Americans than ever now own battle rifles such as ARs, AKs and PTR 91s. People bought all these guns for a reason. And they sure didn't buy them just to turn them over to a corrupt criminal government. The reader comment continues: Whatever happens after this Presidential election, it will have been unleashed by the corporate elites and their servants in the media and elsewhere. They will be responsible for blood in the streets... And many will cheer it. What the author is saying is, essentially, America is quite likely just 70 days away from the start of the next revolution... or even events that could escalate into Civil War. A Hillary victory would set off an immediate popular revolt If Hillary wins the election, it's hard not to imagine some sort of popular revolt across America as the citizens reject the obvious criminality and corruption of not just the Clinton crime family but also a complicit mainstream media. The same media that has funneled millions of dollars into the Clinton Foundation also intentionally downplays all the Clinton scandals. The entire system is a corrupt, incestuous, rigged f--kfest that benefits the deceitful plutocrats whom the voters are sick and tired of seeing remain in power. As world history teaches us, it would only take a tiny fraction of the American people marching on Washington to overthrow the corrupt regime and install a new interim government while arresting the mainstream journalists and calling for new, open elections. So much of America is already at the breaking point now that such a move would very likely enjoy widespread support from the population at large. Such actions are far more common than you might suspect in other countries around the world. When the masses reach their limit on corruption and criminality at the highest levels of government, history has shown they frequently march on the capitol, arrest the traitors, and install new officials to run the government. Sometimes, these people end up being dictators or tyrants who make things worse, so such actions should never be taken lightly. Revolt should only be the very last, reluctant option after every legal, democratic method of restoring the law has been attempted and denied. If any of this sounds surprising to you, you probably need to study world history and read about the French Revolution, the Bolivar campaign across South America, the Fidel Castro takeover of Cuba, the CIA-instigated revolutions of Central and South American nations, the Cultural Revolution of China, and of course the American Revolution. If you don't know anything about history, then you have no clue how history reliably repeats itself as human populations re-experience the same tyrannies, the same political deceptions and the same inner call for freedom that our ancestors already lived through (or died for). There's nothing new under the sun... everything we are about to experience has happened before. (And the Clintons are nothing new, either. They're the same old corrupt crony tyrants and sleaze peddlers we've always seen seeking power to rule over others.) If Trump wins, the globalist banksters crash the debt bubble to unleash mass chaos Now let's shift gears and explore what happens if Trump wins the election. The day after the election results show Trump to be the clear winner, radical leftists break out into mass protests across America. But Obama is still in power at this point, and Trump won't actually occupy the White House until early 2017. So for the remainder of 2016, Obama will open the borders wide open and even encourage as many illegals as possible to invade the USA in a final ""mad dash"" to the USA. Very soon after Trump takes office, the globalist criminal bankers will deliberately crash the global debt bubble so they can blame it all on Trump. Supported by the lying, wholly dishonest propaganda media (CNN, WashPost, NY Times, etc.), global info-terrorists like George Soros will call for Trump's impeachment. Trump, in turn, will likely call upon ""Second Amendment people"" to defend America against the globalist attempts to bring it down and destroy his presidency. This situation quickly escalates into a variety of skirmishes across America, which might include many events that could seem unimaginable today: Armed patriots taking over mainstream media broadcast centers, leftist terrorists bombing federal buildings, a rash of sudden ""suicides"" of high-level Trump loyalists, organized gang assaults on local police stations, the United Nations unleashing ""blue helmet"" troops on U.S. soil, a ""surge invasion"" of illegal aliens from Mexico during a time of national vulnerability, international cyber attacks on America's power grid infrastructure, and even widespread calls for states like Texas to secede from the union. Once the globalists declare open warfare against the Trump administration, all bets are off and anything could unfold over the next few years. Expect things to get very nasty, very desperate and incredibly violent. Life as you know it in America is about to be disrupted in a serious way. By the way, I also predict that Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Anonymous will all play key roles in these unfolding events, exposing mind-blowing government secrets that spur populations across many western nations into escalating their action against the corrupt government regimes they've foolishly allowed to rule over them. Much of the real war taking place across our globe right now is a cyber war... a ""war of secrets"" where the hackers and cyber activists are increasingly exposing all the corruption and criminality of governments, which maintain their power by constantly lying to the public and withholding the truth. The political establishment as we know it today will not survive intact When it's all said and done, if Trump wins the presidency, the political establishment as we know it today will be obliterated on multiple levels. For starters, the people have already lost faith in the establishment system, and if things escalate, it's not difficult to envision a near future where Hillary Clinton is imprisoned while people like Huma, Lynch and Eric Holder are tried for treason. Even if Clinton does win the election and occupy the White House, the global end game is fast approaching anyway. A Clinton White House only further encourages the calls for revolt across the population, and Hillary's deep corruption and criminality is so despised by nearly all soldiers and police officers that it's hard to imagine her being able to demand respect from either of those groups. In fact, it's a lot easier to imagine a military coup against President Clinton that it is to imagine a successful eradication of the Second Amendment by her presidency. Even if Clinton ordered police across America to go door to door and confiscate all the firearms of private citizens, what cop would be stupid enough to even attempt such a suicide mission? I can't overstate this point: Things are at a breaking point in America, and the only thing holding back a mass revolt right now is the looming election, which presents at least a glimmer of hope to the people of America that they might beat back tyranny and government oppression with a Trump victory. If that possibility is taken from them -- either by the election being stolen at the ballot box or already pre-stolen by outrageously biased media deceptions -- many of them will conclude that they really have no remaining option other than ""refreshing the Tree of Liberty with the blood of patriots and tyrants"", to quote Jefferson. America has nearly reached the fulcrum of rebellion ""We Are at a Point Where the Encroachment of Government Power Has Historically Resulted in Rebellion,"" explains this article at The Daily Sheeple (originally from ZeroHedge). What Washington elites utterly fail to realize is that for many Americans, they have nothing else left to lose if they lose this election. They've already lost their job and their health coverage. In many places across America, they're losing their own national flag and national pride. They've been ridiculed, condemned and spat upon by the dishonest media and the crybully leftist f--ktards, and they realize full well that if they don't draw a line in the sand right here, right now, they're going to be disarmed, enslaved, impoverished and named ""enemies of the state"" in the very same country they once fought for (and pledged allegiance to). The psyche of real America has reached its last straw. With the culture under attack, the Constitution demonized, religious beliefs targeted for merciless condemnation and the industrial base of America utterly gutted beyond restoration, there is nothing left to surrender to the demands of the tyrannical left. It is at that breaking point where, in the minds of many citizens throughout history, they pick up pitch forks and march en masse against the oppressors in power. We are very, very close to that day in America. It may, in fact, unravel in just the next 100 days. No matter who wins this election, mass violence breaks out across America in one way or another. Never hope for Civil War... be careful what you ask for Remember: Civil War would be a disaster for America, which is one reason why globalists like George Soros are pushing so hard for it. We should never wish for open bloodshed and nationwide chaos. As one voice of reason commented on The Burning Platform page: The last civil war was disastrous for the US  not just in lives and destruction of property, but in turning what had been a truly positive political structure instantly into something much more corrupt. I see no reason to think that another civil war won't do the same. Yes, we are being pushed towards another civil war quite deliberately. Resist the push. Figure out the real problem and go after it. I do not know exactly what the problem is, but it certainly seems to be a small group of fantastically wealthy and evil people who are using the rest of us like a sociopathic 10-year-old might fry ants. These people need to be identified and blocked from power. Soros seems to be a prominent person among them, but the various other usual suspects seem likely to be the problem as well. Questions to ask yourself in all this How will you feed yourself if social chaos halts food deliveries to your local grocers? Do you possess a means of self-defense that does not depend on dialing 911 and praying somebody shows up to save you? Do you live within walking distance of the inner cities? If so, prepare to be overrun by raging, violent, angry extremists who respect no law and actually murder police every chance they get. Do you depend on financial payments from the federal government? How would you survive if those payments stop coming? If you own firearms, do you know how to use them effectively and safely? When was the last time you practiced with them, or cleaned them? Do you have spare parts? Ammo? Cleaning supplies? When was the last time you checked the battery on your red dot sight?

84,cyber crime,The_Donald,A Complete Transcription and Annotation of Mr. Trump's Foreign Policy Speech [OC],12,4y6xi8,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4y6xi8/a_complete_transcription_and_annotation_of_mr/,2016-08-18 03:30:38,"##DONALD TRUMP FOREIGN POLICY SPEECH 8.15.16 TRANSCRIPT AND ANNOTATIONS ###Compiled by Evan Bennet, /u/AnAmericanComposer [AUDIENCE APPLAUSE, CHANTING Trump-Trump-Trump-] Thank you, everybody, thank you very much. Its great to be with you this afternoon and today we begin a conversation on how to make America safe again. In the twentieth century, the United States has defeated fascism, Nazism and communism. Now, a different threat faces our world: radical Islamic terrorism. This summer, theres been an ISIS attack launched outside the warzones of the Middle East - hard to believe - every [eighty-four hours](URL Here in America, we have seen one brutal attack after another: thirteen were murdered and thirty-eight wounded in the assault on [Fort Hood](URL The Boston Marathon bombing wounded and maimed [sixty-four people](URL and ultimately left five dead, including two of our great police officers . In Chatanooga, Tennessee, [five unarmed Marines](URL - unbelievable people, by the way - were shot and killed at a military recruiting center . Last September, fourteen innocent Americans were gunned down at an office party in [San Bernadino](URL another twenty-two were very gravely injured. In June, forty-nine Americans were executed at the [Pulse nightclub](URL in Orlando . Another fifty-three were badly injured. It was the worst mass shooting in our history, and the attack, by far, the worst on the LGBTQ community, and Ill tell you what: we can never, ever allow this to happen again. [APPLAUSE] In Europe - thank you. In Europe, weve seen the same carnage and bloodshed inflicted upon our closest allies. In January of 2015, a French satirical newspaper, [Charlie Hebdo](URL was attacked for publishing cartoons of the prophet Muhammad. Twelve were killed, including two police officers, and eleven were wounded. Two days later, [four were murdered](URL in a Jewish delicatessen. In November of 2015, terrorists went on a [shooting rampage in Paris](URL that slaughtered 130 people and wounded another 368 people, some in very, very, very bad shape today. France is suffering greatly, and the [tourism industry](URL is being massively affected in a most negative way. In March of this year, terrorists detonated a bomb in Brussels airport, killing thirty-two and injuring [340 people](URL This July, in the south of France, an Islamic terrorist turned his truck into an instrument of [mass murder](URL plowing down and killing eighty-five men, women and children, and wounding 308 people. Terrible. Among the dead were two Americans: a [Texas father and his eleven-year-old son](URL A few weeks ago in Germany, a refugee armed with an axe wounded five people in a [gruesome train attack](URL Only days ago, an ISIS killer invaded a Christian church in Normandy, France , forced an [eighty-five-year-old priest](URL to his knees - a priest who was beloved, who was beloved - before cutting his throat and just unthinkable other things. Overseas, ISIS has carried out an absolute atrocity in one after the other. Children slaughtered, girls sold into slavery, men and women burned alive, crucifixions, beheadings and drownings, ethnic minorities targeted for mass execution, holy sites desecrated, Christians driven from their homes and hunted for extermination. ISIS rounding up what it calls nation of the cross - [nation of the cross](URL - in a campaign of absolute and total genocide. We cannot let this evil continue. [APPLAUSE] Thank you. Thank you. Nor can we let the hateful ideology of radical Islam - its suppression of women, gays, children and non-believers - be allowed to reside or spread within our own countries. [APPLAUSE] We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism just as we have defeated every threat we have faced at every age and before, but we will not - we will not remember this defeated with closed eyes or silenced voices - we have a president that doesnt want to [say the words](URL Anyone who cannot name our enemy is not fit to lead our country. [APPLAUSE] Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our president. [APPLAUSE] The rise of ISIS is the direct result of policy decisions made by President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton. Lets look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009, before the Obama-Clinton Administration took over: [Libya was stable](URL [Syria was under control](URL Egypt was ruled by a secular president and an [ally of the United States](URL Iraq was experiencing a [reduction in violence](URL the group that would become what we now call [ISIS was close to being extinguished](URL [Iran was being choked off](URL by [economic sanctions](URL Fast-forward to today. What we have - and think of this - and the decisions made by the Obama-Clinton group have been absolutely disastrous. Libya is in ruins, our ambassador and [three other really brave Americans are dead](URL and ISIS has gained a new [base of operations](URL Syria is in a midst of a disastrous civil war. ISIS controls large portions of territory. A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States. In Egypt, terrorists have gained a foothold in the [Sinai desert](URL near the Suez Canal, one of the most essential waterways in the world. Iraq is in chaos, and ISIS is on the loose. ISIS has spread across the Middle East and into the West. In 2014, ISIS was operating in [seven nations](URL - they were in seven nations. Terrible, but thats what it was. Today, they are fully operational in [eighteen countries](URL with aspiring branches in six more for a total of twenty-four and many believe that number is actually twenty-eight to thirty countries. They dont even know. The situation is likely worse than the public has any idea. A new congressional report reveals that the administration has [downplayed the growth of ISIS](URL with 40% of analysts saying they had experienced efforts to manipulate their findings. Theyre trying to make it look much better than it is. Its bad. At the same time, ISIS is trying to [infiltrate refugee flows](URL into Europe and into the [United States](URL Iran, the worlds largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush, with [$150 billion](URL in cash released by the United States, plus - if you remember from two weeks ago - another [$400 million in actual cash](URL that was obviously used for ransom . Worst of all, the nuclear deal puts Iran, the number one state sponsor of radical Islamic terrorism on a path to nuclear weapons. In short, the Obama-Clinton foreign policy has unleashed ISIS, destabilized the Middle East, and put the nation of Iran, which chants [death to America](URL in a dominant position of regional power and in fact aspiring to be a dominant world power. It all began in 2009 with what has become known as [President Obamas Global Apology Tour](URL We all remember, we all remember. [BOOS] In a series of speeches, Obama described America as arrogant, dismissive, derisive, and a colonial power. He was describing us. He informed other countries that he would be speaking up about Americas past errors. He pledged that we would no longer be a senior partner that sought to dictate our terms. He lectured CIA officers of the need to acknowledge their mistakes and described Guantanamo Bay as a [rallying cry for our enemies](URL Perhaps no speech was more misguided than President Obamas speech to the Muslim world delivered in Cairo, Egypt, 2009 - I remember it well. In winning the Cold War, President Ronald Reagan repeatedly touted the superiority of freedom over communism, and called the USSR the evil empire. Yet, when President Obama delivered his address in Cairo, no such moral courage could be found or would be found. Instead of condemning the oppression of women and gays in many Muslim nations, and the systematic violations of human rights, or the financing of global terrorism, President Obama tried to draw an equivalency between our human rights...record - and remember this - [our human rights and theirs](URL the records are unbelievable and unmistakable. His nave words were followed by even more nave actions: the failure to establish a new [status of forces](URL agreement in Iraq , and the election-driven timetable for withdrawal, surrendered our gains in that country and lead directly to the [rise of ISIS](URL without question. [APPLAUSE] The failures in Iraq were compounded by Hillary Clintons disaster - total disaster - in Libya. President Obama has since said that he regrets, and really regrets, Libya and the mistake he made. He considers it [his worst mistake](URL According to then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, the invasion of Libya was nearly a split decision, but Hillary [Clintons forceful advocacy](URL for the intervention was the deciding factor : thats why we went in. With one episode of bad judgement after another, Hillary Clintons policies launched ISIS onto the worlds stage. Yet, as she threw the Middle East into violent turmoil, things turned out really to be not-so-hot for our world and our country, the Middle East in particular. The Clintons made almost [$60 million](URL in gross income while she was Secretary of State. It is unbelievable. Incident after incident proves again and again, Hillary Clinton lacks the judgement - [as said by Bernie Sanders](URL - stability and temperament, and the moral character to lead our nation. [APPLAUSE] Importantly, she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS and all of the many adversaries we face, not only in terrorism but in trade and every other challenge we must confront to turn our great country around. [APPLAUSE] It is now time for a new approach. Our current strategy of nation-building and regime change is a proven absolute failure. We have created the vacuums that allow terrorism to grow and thrive. [I was an opponent of the Iraq war](URL from the beginning . A major difference between me and my opponent. Though I was a private citizen whose opinions on such matters were really not sought, I nonetheless publicly expressed my private doubts about the invasion. I was against it, believe me. Three months before the invasion, I said in an interview with [Neil Cavuto](URL to whom I offer my best wishes for his speedy recovery, that quote perhaps we shouldnt be doing it yet , and that the economy is a much bigger problem. In August of 2004 - very early, right after the conflict - I made a detailed statement to [Esquire magazine](URL in an interview. Here is the quote in full: Look at the war in Iraq and the mess were in. I would never have handled it that way - this was right after the invasion. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to go and step up and lead the country? Cmon. [APPLAUSE] I then continued: Two minutes after we leave, there is going to be a revolution and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy - in this case, guy - will take over, and hell have weapons of mass destruction which Saddam Hussein did not have. What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed, and what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs? Not to mention, in all fairness, the other side. The tremendous damage done. All those Iraqi kids whove been blown to pieces, and it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All of this death and destruction for nothing. So Ive been clear for a long time that we should not have gone in, but I have been just as clear in saying what a catastrophic mistake Hillary Clinton and President Obama made with the reckless way in which they pulled out. [APPLAUSE] After we had made those hard-fought sacrifices in gains, we should have never made such a sudden withdrawal, on a timetable, advertised, to our enemies. They said were moving out. Heres our time, heres our date... Who would do this but an incompetent president? [APPLAUSE] Al Qaeda in Iraq had been decimated and Obama and Clinton gave it new life and allowed it to [spread all across the world](URL By that same token, President Obama and Hillary Clinton should have never attempted to build a democracy in Libya, to push for immediate regime change in Syria, or to support the overthrow of Mubarak in Egypt. One more point on this: I have long said that we should have [kept the oi](URL in Iraq . [APPLAUSE] I said it over and over and over again. Another area where my judgement has been proven correct. I just said it so many times, virtually every time I was interviewed, Keep the oil. Keep the oil. According to CNN, ISIS made as much as [500 million in oil sales](URL in 2014 alone - thats before they really got started - fueling and funding terror. If we had controlled the oil, like I said we should, we could have prevented the rise of ISIS in Iraq, both by cutting off a major source of funding and through the presence of US sources necessary to safeguard the oil, and vital infrastructure necessary for us to have the oil. I was saying this constantly and consistently to whoever would listen - I said Keep the oil. Keep the oil. Keep the oil. Dont let somebody else get it. [APPLAUSE] If they had listened to me then, we would have had the economic benefits of the oil, which I wanted to use to help [take care of the wounded soldiers](URL and families of those who died in the war. [APPLAUSE] In addition to which, thousands of lives would have been saved. This proposal, by its very nature, would have left soldiers in place of our assets. We would have had soldiers there guarding this valuable supply of oil. In the old days, when we won a war, to the victor belonged the spoils. [APPLAUSE] Instead, all we got from Iraq and our adventures in the Middle East was death, destruction and tremendous financial loss. But its time to put the mistakes of the past behind us, and chart a new course. [APPLAUSE] If I become president, the era of nation-building will be brought to a very swift and decisive end. [APPLAUSE, CHEERS] Thank you. Our new approach, which must be shared by both parties in America, by our allies overseas, and by our friends in the Middle East, must be to halt the spread of radical Islam. [APPLAUSE] All actions should be oriented around this goal, and any country that shares this goal will be our ally. Very important. [APPLAUSE] Some dont share this goal. We cannot always choose our friends, but we can never fail to recognize our enemies. [APPLAUSE]. As president, I will call for an international conference focused on this goal. We will work side-by-side with our friends in the Middle East, including our greatest ally Israel. [APPLAUSE, CHEERS] We will partner with [King Abdullah](URL of Jordon and the president of Egypt, [President Sisi](URL and all others who recognize this ideology of death must be extinguished. [APPLAUSE] We will also work very closely on NATO with this new mission. I had previously said that NATO was obsolete because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism. Since my comments, they have changed their policy and now have a new division focused on terror threats. Very good. Very, very good. I also believe that we can find common ground with Russia with the [fight against ISIS](URL Wouldnt that be a good thing? Wouldnt that be a good thing? [APPLAUSE, CHEERS] They, too, have much at stake with the outcome in Syria and have had their own battles with Islamic terrorism, just as bad as ours. They have a big, big problem in Russia with ISIS. My administration will aggressively joint and coalition military operations to crush and destroy ISIS. International cooperation to cut off their funding, expanded intelligence sharing and cyber warfare to distrust and disable their propaganda recruiting. Their recruiting is taking place right now, and [theyre setting records](URL Its gotta be stopped. [APPLAUSE] We cannot allow the internet to be used as a recruiting tool, and for other purposes - by our enemy. We must shut down their access to this form of communication, and we must do it immediately - immediately. [APPLAUSE] Unlike Hillary Clinton who has risked so many lives with her careless handling of sensitive information, my administration will not telegram exactly military plans and what they are. [APPLAUSE, CHEERS] And by the way, whats happened with her 33,000 emails is an absolute disgrace to the United States of America. [APPLAUSE, CHANTING Trump-Trump-Trump-] Thank you. Ive often said that the great General Douglass MacArthur and the great General George Patton would be in a state of shock if they were alive today to see the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton tried to recklessly [announce their every move](URL before it happens . Like they did in Iraq, so that the enemy can prepare and adapt. Their enemy says thank you. The fight will not be limited to ISIS. We will decimate Al Qaeda, and we will seek to starve funding for Iran Hamas Hezbollah, so important. We can use existing [UN Security Council resolutions](URL to apply new and even stronger sanctions. Military, cyber and financial warfare will all be necessary to dismantle Islamic terrorism, but we must use ideological warfare as well. Very important, and they use it on us, better than we have ever even thought of using it on them, but that will change. Just as we won - thank you. Just as we won the Cold War in part by exposing the evils of communism and the [virtues of free markets](URL so too must we take on the ideology of radical Islam. While my opponent [accepted millions of dollars](URL in donations from countries where being gay is an offense punishable by [prison or death](URL my administration will speak out against the oppression of women, gays and people of different beliefs. [APPLAUSE] Our administration will be a friend to all moderate Muslim reformers in the Middle East and will amplify their voices. This includes speaking out against the horrible practice of honor killings where women are murdered by their relatives for dressing, marrying or acting in a way that [violates fundamentalist teachings](URL Over [one-thousand Pakistani girls](URL are estimated to be the victims of honor killings by their relatives each year . Recently a prominent [Pakistani social media star](URL was strangled to death by her brother on the charge of dishonoring the family. In his confession, the brother took pride in the murder and said girls are born to stay home and follow traditions. Shockingly, this is a practiced that has reached [our own shores](URL On such cases - and many, many cases have happened - but one involves an Iraqi immigrant who was [sentenced to thirty-four years](URL in jail for running over his own daughter, claiming she had been too Westernized . To defeat Islamic terrorism, we must also speak out forcefully against a hateful ideology that provides the breeding ground for violence and terrorism to grow. Its a breeding ground. Its a terrible, terrible breeding ground. A new immigration policy is needed immediately and as well. [APPLAUSE, CHEERS] Thank you. The common thread linking the major Islamic terrorist attacks that have recently occurred on our soil - [9/11](URL the [Fort Hood shooting](URL the [Boston Bombing](URL the [San Bernadino attack](URL the [Orlando attack](URL - is that they have involved immigrants, or the children of immigrants . Clearly, new screening procedures are needed. [APPLAUSE] A review by the US Senate Immigration Subcommittee has identified 380 foreign-born individuals charged with terrorism or terrorism-related offenses [between 9/11 and 2014](URL and many more since then, and this year is a record year for identification. Its gotten worse, far worse. We also know that ISIS recruits refugees after their entrance into the country, as we have seen with the Somali refugee population in Minnesota. Beyond terrorism, as weve also seen in France, foreign populations have brought their anti-Semitic attitudes with them. In Cologne, Germany, on New Years Eve, we have seen the [reports of sexual violence and assault](URL far greater than anybody knows. Pew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large numbers of immigrants, [extreme views about religion](URL such as the death penalty, and for those who are involved, the death penalty is very, very common if you dont have the faith that they demand you have. The Trump Administration will establish a clear principle that will govern all decisions pertaining to immigration, and we will be tough, and we will be even extreme. [APPLAUSE] We should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people. In the Cold War, we had an [ideological screening test](URL The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today. I call it extreme vetting. I call it extreme - extreme vetting. Our country has enough problems. We dont need more, and these are problems like weve never had before. [APPLAUSE, CHEERS] In addition to screening out all members of the sympathizers we must also screen out any with hostile attitudes toward our country or its principles, or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law. [APPLAUSE] Those who do not believe in our Constitution or who support bigotry or hatred will not be admitted for immigration into our country. [APPLAUSE, CHEERS] Only those who we expect to flourish in our country, and to embrace a tolerant American society should be issued visas. [APPLAUSE] To put these new procedures in place, we will have to temporarily suspend immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world, that have a history of exporting terrorism, nor for us! Not for us. [APPLAUSE, CHANTING Trump-Trump-Trump-] Thank you. Thank you. As soon as I take office, I will ask the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security to identify a list of regions where adequate screening cannot take place, there are many such regions. We will stop processing visas from those areas until such time as it is deemed safe to resume, based on new circumstances or new procedures. The size of current immigration flows are simply too large to perform adequate screening. [APPLAUSE] We admit about [100,000 permanent immigrants](URL from the Middle East every year . Beyond that, we admit [hundreds of thousands](URL of temporary workers and visitors from the same regions - hundreds of thousands . If we dont control the numbers, we cant perform adequate screening. Theres no way it can take place. [APPLAUSE] By contrast, my opponent wants to increase - which is unbelievable, no matter who you are, where you come from - wants to increase the flow of Syrian refugees by [550%](URL over what they are now. [BOOS] The United States Senate Subcommittee on Immigration estimates that Hillarys plan would mean [roughly 620,000 refugees](URL from all current refugee-sending nations in her first term , assuming no cuts to other refugee programs - so it could get worse! This would be additional to all other non-refugee immigration. Unbelievable numbers. Unbelievable numbers. The Subcommittee estimates her plan would impose a lifetime cost of roughly $400 billion when you include the cost of healthcare, welfare, housing, schooling and other entitlement benefits that are excluded from the State Departments placement figures. Think of this: $400 billion. In short, Hillary Clinton wants to be Americas Angela Merkel. [BOOS, LAUGHTER] And you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to Germany and the people of Germany. [Crime has risen](URL to levels that no one thought they would ever, ever see. It is a catastrophe. We have enough problems in our country. We dont need more. Lastly, we will need to restore common sense to our security procedures. Another common feature of the past attacks that have occurred on our soil is that warning signs were totally ignored. The 9/11 hijackers had [fraud all over their visa applications](URL Almost every one of them. It said practically in big bold letters fraud. And nobody saw it. The Russians warned us about the [Boston bombers](URL here on political asylum, and the attackers were even [twice interviewed by the FBI](URL Very sad. The female San Bernadino shooter, on her - on her statements, and everything that she said: she was here on a [fiance visa](URL which most people have not even heard of, from Saudi Arabia, and she wanted to [support very openly jihad online](URL These are the people were taking in. A neighbor saw suspicious behavior - bombs on the floor, and other things - but didnt warn authorities because they said they didnt want to be accused of [racial profiling](URL Now, many are dead and many more are gravely wounded. The shooter in Orlando reportedly [celebrated in his classroom](URL after 9/11 . He, too, was [interviewed by the FBI](URL His father, a native of Afghanistan, [supported the oppressive Taliban regime](URL and expressed anti-American views very strongly , and by the way, was just seen [sitting behind Hillary Clinton](URL with a big fat smile on his face, all the way through her speech . [BOOS] He obviously liked what she had to say. Its called: weakness, weakness. Its called stupidity, and weve had it. [APPLAUSE] The Fort Hood shooter delivered a presentation to a [room full of mental health experts](URL before the attacks in which he threw out one red flag after another. He even proclaimed that we [""love death more then you love life""](URL Not good. These warning signs were ignored because political correctness has replaced common sense in our society. [APPLAUSE, CHANTING Trump-Trump-Trump-] Thank you. Thank you. That is why one of my first acts as president will be to establish a commission on radical Islam, which will include reformers voices in the Muslim community, who will hopefully work with us. We want to build bridges and erase divisions. The goal of the commission will be to identify and explain to the American public the core convictions and beliefs of radical Islam, to identify the warning signs of radicalization, and to expose the networks in our society that support radicalization. This commission will be used to develop new protocols for local police officers, federal investigators and immigration screeners. And while Im at it, we should give a hand to our great police officers and law enforcement officials. [APPLAUSE, CHEERS, CHANTING Trump-Trump-Trump-] Thank you. Thank you. We will also keep open Guantanamo Bay and place a renewed emphasis on human intelligence. Drone strikes will remain part of our strategy, but we will also seek to capture high-value targets to gain needed information to dismantle their organizations. [APPLAUSE] Foreign combatants will be tried in military commissions. [APPLAUSE, CHEERS] Finally, we will pursue aggressive criminal or immigration charges against anyone who lends materiel support to terrorism. There will be consequences for those people. There will be very serious consequences. [APPLUASE] Similar to the effort to take down the mafia, this will be the understood mission of every federal investigator and prosecutor in the country. [APPLAUSE] To accomplish a goal, you must state a mission. The support networks for radical Islam in this country will be stripped out and removed, one-by-one, viciously if necessary - viciously if necessary. Immigration offices will also have their powers restored. Those have been taken away. Those who are guests in our country that are preaching hate will be asked to return home immediately and if they dont immediately, we will return them home. To make America safe again, we must work together again. Our victory in the Cold War relied on a bipartisan and international consensus. That is what we must have to defeat radical Islamic terrorism. [APPLAUSE] But just like we couldnt defeat communism without acknowledging that communism exists, or explaining its horrible evils, we cant defeat radical Islamic terrorism unless we do the exact same thing. We have to explain that it exists, and explain the difficulties. We have to have a leader that can do that, and we do not have that now. But this also means that we have to promote the exceptional virtues of our own way of life. We have an exceptional country, an exceptional way of life. But its being tread on by sick, sick people. And expecting that as newcomers come into our society, they will likewise have respect and do the same. Pride in our institutions, our history and our values should be taught by parents and teachers and impressed upon all of those that come into our society and want to join our society. [APPLAUSE] Assimilation is not an act of hostility, but an expression of compassion. Our system of government and our American culture is the best in the world, and well produce the best outcomes for all who adopt it. [APPLAUSE, CHANTING USA-USA-USA-] Thank you. Thank you. This approach will not only make us safer, but bring us closer together as a country. Renewing the spirit of Americanism will help heal the divisions in our country, of which there are so many. We have a divider as president. We call him the Great Divider. Its the thing he best. [APPLAUSE] It will do so by emphasizing what we have in common, not what pulls us apart. This is my pledge to the American People: as your president, I will be your single greatest champion. I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally and honored equally. [APPLAUSE] We will reject bigotry and hatred, and oppression, in all of its ugly forms, and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American People. Only this way will we make America great again, and safe again, for everyone. Thank you very much, God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Its great to be with you this afternoon and today we begin a conversation on how to make America safe again. In the twentieth century, the United States has defeated fascism, Nazism and communism. Now, a different threat faces our world: radical Islamic terrorism. This summer, theres been an ISIS attack launched outside the warzones of the Middle East - hard to believe - every [eighty-four hours](URL Here in America, we have seen one brutal attack after another: thirteen were murdered and thirty-eight wounded in the assault on [Fort Hood](URL The Boston Marathon bombing wounded and maimed [sixty-four people](URL and ultimately left five dead, including two of our great police officers . In Chatanooga, Tennessee, [five unarmed Marines](URL - unbelievable people, by the way - were shot and killed at a military recruiting center . Last September, fourteen innocent Americans were gunned down at an office party in [San Bernadino](URL another twenty-two were very gravely injured. In June, forty-nine Americans were executed at the [Pulse nightclub](URL in Orlando . Another fifty-three were badly injured. It was the worst mass shooting in our history, and the attack, by far, the worst on the LGBTQ community, and Ill tell you what: we can never, ever allow this to happen again. [APPLAUSE] In Europe - thank you. In Europe, weve seen the same carnage and bloodshed inflicted upon our closest allies. In January of 2015, a French satirical newspaper, [Charlie Hebdo](URL was attacked for publishing cartoons of the prophet Muhammad. Twelve were killed, including two police officers, and eleven were wounded. Two days later, [four were murdered](URL in a Jewish delicatessen. In November of 2015, terrorists went on a [shooting rampage in Paris](URL that slaughtered 130 people and wounded another 368 people, some in very, very, very bad shape today. France is suffering greatly, and the [tourism industry](URL is being massively affected in a most negative way. In March of this year, terrorists detonated a bomb in Brussels airport, killing thirty-two and injuring [340 people](URL This July, in the south of France, an Islamic terrorist turned his truck into an instrument of [mass murder](URL plowing down and killing eighty-five men, women and children, and wounding 308 people. Terrible. Among the dead were two Americans: a [Texas father and his eleven-year-old son](URL A few weeks ago in Germany, a refugee armed with an axe wounded five people in a [gruesome train attack](URL Only days ago, an ISIS killer invaded a Christian church in Normandy, France , forced an [eighty-five-year-old priest](URL to his knees - a priest who was beloved, who was beloved - before cutting his throat and just unthinkable other things. Overseas, ISIS has carried out an absolute atrocity in one after the other. Children slaughtered, girls sold into slavery, men and women burned alive, crucifixions, beheadings and drownings, ethnic minorities targeted for mass execution, holy sites desecrated, Christians driven from their homes and hunted for extermination. ISIS rounding up what it calls nation of the cross - [nation of the cross](URL - in a campaign of absolute and total genocide. We cannot let this evil continue. [APPLAUSE] Thank you. Thank you. Nor can we let the hateful ideology of radical Islam - its suppression of women, gays, children and non-believers - be allowed to reside or spread within our own countries. [APPLAUSE] We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism just as we have defeated every threat we have faced at every age and before, but we will not - we will not remember this defeated with closed eyes or silenced voices - we have a president that doesnt want to [say the words](URL Anyone who cannot name our enemy is not fit to lead our country. [APPLAUSE] Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our president. [APPLAUSE] The rise of ISIS is the direct result of policy decisions made by President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton. Lets look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009, before the Obama-Clinton Administration took over: [Libya was stable](URL [Syria was under control](URL Egypt was ruled by a secular president and an [ally of the United States](URL Iraq was experiencing a [reduction in violence](URL the group that would become what we now call [ISIS was close to being extinguished](URL [Iran was being choked off](URL by [economic sanctions](URL Fast-forward to today. What we have - and think of this - and the decisions made by the Obama-Clinton group have been absolutely disastrous. Libya is in ruins, our ambassador and [three other really brave Americans are dead](URL and ISIS has gained a new [base of operations](URL Syria is in a midst of a disastrous civil war. ISIS controls large portions of territory. A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States. In Egypt, terrorists have gained a foothold in the [Sinai desert](URL near the Suez Canal, one of the most essential waterways in the world. Iraq is in chaos, and ISIS is on the loose. ISIS has spread across the Middle East and into the West. In 2014, ISIS was operating in [seven nations](URL - they were in seven nations. Terrible, but thats what it was. Today, they are fully operational in [eighteen countries](URL with aspiring branches in six more for a total of twenty-four and many believe that number is actually twenty-eight to thirty countries. They dont even know. The situation is likely worse than the public has any idea. A new congressional report reveals that the administration has [downplayed the growth of ISIS](URL with 40% of analysts saying they had experienced efforts to manipulate their findings. Theyre trying to make it look much better than it is. Its bad. At the same time, ISIS is trying to [infiltrate refugee flows](URL into Europe and into the [United States](URL Iran, the worlds largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush, with [$150 billion](URL in cash released by the United States, plus - if you remember from two weeks ago - another [$400 million in actual cash](URL that was obviously used for ransom . Worst of all, the nuclear deal puts Iran, the number one state sponsor of radical Islamic terrorism on a path to nuclear weapons. In short, the Obama-Clinton foreign policy has unleashed ISIS, destabilized the Middle East, and put the nation of Iran, which chants [death to America](URL in a dominant position of regional power and in fact aspiring to be a dominant world power. It all began in 2009 with what has become known as [President Obamas Global Apology Tour](URL We all remember, we all remember. [BOOS] In a series of speeches, Obama described America as arrogant, dismissive, derisive, and a colonial power. He was describing us. He informed other countries that he would be speaking up about Americas past errors. He pledged that we would no longer be a senior partner that sought to dictate our terms. He lectured CIA officers of the need to acknowledge their mistakes and described Guantanamo Bay as a [rallying cry for our enemies](URL Perhaps no speech was more misguided than President Obamas speech to the Muslim world delivered in Cairo, Egypt, 2009 - I remember it well. In winning the Cold War, President Ronald Reagan repeatedly touted the superiority of freedom over communism, and called the USSR the evil empire. Yet, when President Obama delivered his address in Cairo, no such moral courage could be found or would be found. Instead of condemning the oppression of women and gays in many Muslim nations, and the systematic violations of human rights, or the financing of global terrorism, President Obama tried to draw an equivalency between our human rights...record - and remember this - [our human rights and theirs](URL the records are unbelievable and unmistakable. His nave words were followed by even more nave actions: the failure to establish a new [status of forces](URL agreement in Iraq , and the election-driven timetable for withdrawal, surrendered our gains in that country and lead directly to the [rise of ISIS](URL without question. [APPLAUSE] The failures in Iraq were compounded by Hillary Clintons disaster - total disaster - in Libya. President Obama has since said that he regrets, and really regrets, Libya and the mistake he made. He considers it [his worst mistake](URL According to then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, the invasion of Libya was nearly a split decision, but Hillary [Clintons forceful advocacy](URL for the intervention was the deciding factor : thats why we went in. With one episode of bad judgement after another, Hillary Clintons policies launched ISIS onto the worlds stage. Yet, as she threw the Middle East into violent turmoil, things turned out really to be not-so-hot for our world and our country, the Middle East in particular. The Clintons made almost [$60 million](URL in gross income while she was Secretary of State. It is unbelievable. Incident after incident proves again and again, Hillary Clinton lacks the judgement - [as said by Bernie Sanders](URL - stability and temperament, and the moral character to lead our nation. [APPLAUSE] Importantly, she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS and all of the many adversaries we face, not only in terrorism but in trade and every other challenge we must confront to turn our great country around. [APPLAUSE] It is now time for a new approach. Our current strategy of nation-building and regime change is a proven absolute failure. We have created the vacuums that allow terrorism to grow and thrive. [I was an opponent of the Iraq war](URL from the beginning . A major difference between me and my opponent. Though I was a private citizen whose opinions on such matters were really not sought, I nonetheless publicly expressed my private doubts about the invasion. I was against it, believe me. Three months before the invasion, I said in an interview with [Neil Cavuto](URL to whom I offer my best wishes for his speedy recovery, that quote perhaps we shouldnt be doing it yet , and that the economy is a much bigger problem. In August of 2004 - very early, right after the conflict - I made a detailed statement to [Esquire magazine](URL in an interview. Here is the quote in full: Look at the war in Iraq and the mess were in. I would never have handled it that way - this was right after the invasion. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to go and step up and lead the country? Cmon. [APPLAUSE] I then continued: Two minutes after we leave, there is going to be a revolution and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy - in this case, guy - will take over, and hell have weapons of mass destruction which Saddam Hussein did not have. What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed, and what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs? Not to mention, in all fairness, the other side. The tremendous damage done. All those Iraqi kids whove been blown to pieces, and it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All of this death and destruction for nothing. So Ive been clear for a long time that we should not have gone in, but I have been just as clear in saying what a catastrophic mistake Hillary Clinton and President Obama made with the reckless way in which they pulled out. [APPLAUSE] After we had made those hard-fought sacrifices in gains, we should have never made such a sudden withdrawal, on a timetable, advertised, to our enemies. They said were moving out. Heres our time, heres our date... Who would do this but an incompetent president? [APPLAUSE] Al Qaeda in Iraq had been decimated and Obama and Clinton gave it new life and allowed it to [spread all across the world](URL By that same token, President Obama and Hillary Clinton should have never attempted to build a democracy in Libya, to push for immediate regime change in Syria, or to support the overthrow of Mubarak in Egypt. One more point on this: I have long said that we should have [kept the oi](URL in Iraq . [APPLAUSE] I said it over and over and over again. Another area where my judgement has been proven correct. I just said it so many times, virtually every time I was interviewed, Keep the oil. Keep the oil. According to CNN, ISIS made as much as [500 million in oil sales](URL in 2014 alone - thats before they really got started - fueling and funding terror. If we had controlled the oil, like I said we should, we could have prevented the rise of ISIS in Iraq, both by cutting off a major source of funding and through the presence of US sources necessary to safeguard the oil, and vital infrastructure necessary for us to have the oil. I was saying this constantly and consistently to whoever would listen - I said Keep the oil. Keep the oil. Keep the oil. Dont let somebody else get it. [APPLAUSE] If they had listened to me then, we would have had the economic benefits of the oil, which I wanted to use to help [take care of the wounded soldiers](URL and families of those who died in the war. [APPLAUSE] In addition to which, thousands of lives would have been saved. This proposal, by its very nature, would have left soldiers in place of our assets. We would have had soldiers there guarding this valuable supply of oil. In the old days, when we won a war, to the victor belonged the spoils. [APPLAUSE] Instead, all we got from Iraq and our adventures in the Middle East was death, destruction and tremendous financial loss. But its time to put the mistakes of the past behind us, and chart a new course. [APPLAUSE] If I become president, the era of nation-building will be brought to a very swift and decisive end. [APPLAUSE, CHEERS] Thank you. Our new approach, which must be shared by both parties in America, by our allies overseas, and by our friends in the Middle East, must be to halt the spread of radical Islam. [APPLAUSE] All actions should be oriented around this goal, and any country that shares this goal will be our ally. Very important. [APPLAUSE] Some dont share this goal. We cannot always choose our friends, but we can never fail to recognize our enemies. [APPLAUSE]. As president, I will call for an international conference focused on this goal. We will work side-by-side with our friends in the Middle East, including our greatest ally Israel. [APPLAUSE, CHEERS] We will partner with [King Abdullah](URL of Jordon and the president of Egypt, [President Sisi](URL and all others who recognize this ideology of death must be extinguished. [APPLAUSE] We will also work very closely on NATO with this new mission. I had previously said that NATO was obsolete because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism. Since my comments, they have changed their policy and now have a new division focused on terror threats. Very good. Very, very good. I also believe that we can find common ground with Russia with the [fight against ISIS](URL Wouldnt that be a good thing? Wouldnt that be a good thing? [APPLAUSE, CHEERS] They, too, have much at stake with the outcome in Syria and have had their own battles with Islamic terrorism, just as bad as ours. They have a big, big problem in Russia with ISIS. My administration will aggressively joint and coalition military operations to crush and destroy ISIS. International cooperation to cut off their funding, expanded intelligence sharing and cyber warfare to distrust and disable their propaganda recruiting. Their recruiting is taking place right now, and [theyre setting records](URL Its gotta be stopped. [APPLAUSE] We cannot allow the internet to be used as a recruiting tool, and for other purposes - by our enemy. We must shut down their access to this form of communication, and we must do it immediately - immediately. [APPLAUSE] Unlike Hillary Clinton who has risked so many lives with her careless handling of sensitive information, my administration will not telegram exactly military plans and what they are. [APPLAUSE, CHEERS] And by the way, whats happened with her 33,000 emails is an absolute disgrace to the United States of America. [APPLAUSE, CHANTING Trump-Trump-Trump-] Thank you. Ive often said that the great General Douglass MacArthur and the great General George Patton would be in a state of shock if they were alive today to see the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton tried to recklessly [announce their every move](URL before it happens . Like they did in Iraq, so that the enemy can prepare and adapt. Their enemy says thank you. The fight will not be limited to ISIS. We will decimate Al Qaeda, and we will seek to starve funding for Iran Hamas Hezbollah, so important. We can use existing [UN Security Council resolutions](URL to apply new and even stronger sanctions. Military, cyber and financial warfare will all be necessary to dismantle Islamic terrorism, but we must use ideological warfare as well. Very important, and they use it on us, better than we have ever even thought of using it on them, but that will change. Just as we won - thank you. Just as we won the Cold War in part by exposing the evils of communism and the [virtues of free markets](URL so too must we take on the ideology of radical Islam. While my opponent [accepted millions of dollars](URL in donations from countries where being gay is an offense punishable by [prison or death](URL my administration will speak out against the oppression of women, gays and people of different beliefs. [APPLAUSE] Our administration will be a friend to all moderate Muslim reformers in the Middle East and will amplify their voices. This includes speaking out against the horrible practice of honor killings where women are murdered by their relatives for dressing, marrying or acting in a way that [violates fundamentalist teachings](URL Over [one-thousand Pakistani girls](URL are estimated to be the victims of honor killings by their relatives each year . Recently a prominent [Pakistani social media star](URL was strangled to death by her brother on the charge of dishonoring the family. In his confession, the brother took pride in the murder and said girls are born to stay home and follow traditions. Shockingly, this is a practiced that has reached [our own shores](URL On such cases - and many, many cases have happened - but one involves an Iraqi immigrant who was [sentenced to thirty-four years](URL in jail for running over his own daughter, claiming she had been too Westernized . To defeat Islamic terrorism, we must also speak out forcefully against a hateful ideology that provides the breeding ground for violence and terrorism to grow. Its a breeding ground. Its a terrible, terrible breeding ground. A new immigration policy is needed immediately and as well. [APPLAUSE, CHEERS] Thank you. The common thread linking the major Islamic terrorist attacks that have recently occurred on our soil - [9/11](URL the [Fort Hood shooting](URL the [Boston Bombing](URL the [San Bernadino attack](URL the [Orlando attack](URL - is that they have involved immigrants, or the children of immigrants . Clearly, new screening procedures are needed. [APPLAUSE] A review by the US Senate Immigration Subcommittee has identified 380 foreign-born individuals charged with terrorism or terrorism-related offenses [between 9/11 and 2014](URL and many more since then, and this year is a record year for identification. Its gotten worse, far worse. We also know that ISIS recruits refugees after their entrance into the country, as we have seen with the Somali refugee population in Minnesota. Beyond terrorism, as weve also seen in France, foreign populations have brought their anti-Semitic attitudes with them. In Cologne, Germany, on New Years Eve, we have seen the [reports of sexual violence and assault](URL far greater than anybody knows. Pew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large numbers of immigrants, [extreme views about religion](URL such as the death penalty, and for those who are involved, the death penalty is very, very common if you dont have the faith that they demand you have. The Trump Administration will establish a clear principle that will govern all decisions pertaining to immigration, and we will be tough, and we will be even extreme. [APPLAUSE] We should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people. In the Cold War, we had an [ideological screening test](URL The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today. I call it extreme vetting. I call it extreme - extreme vetting. Our country has enough problems. We dont need more, and these are problems like weve never had before. [APPLAUSE, CHEERS] In addition to screening out all members of the sympathizers we must also screen out any with hostile attitudes toward our country or its principles, or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law. [APPLAUSE] Those who do not believe in our Constitution or who support bigotry or hatred will not be admitted for immigration into our country. [APPLAUSE, CHEERS] Only those who we expect to flourish in our country, and to embrace a tolerant American society should be issued visas. [APPLAUSE] To put these new procedures in place, we will have to temporarily suspend immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world, that have a history of exporting terrorism, nor for us! Not for us. [APPLAUSE, CHANTING Trump-Trump-Trump-] Thank you. Thank you.

Beyond that, we admit [hundreds of thousands](URL of temporary workers and visitors from the same regions - hundreds of thousands . If we dont control the numbers, we cant perform adequate screening. Theres no way it can take place. [APPLAUSE] By contrast, my opponent wants to increase - which is unbelievable, no matter who you are, where you come from - wants to increase the flow of Syrian refugees by [550%](URL over what they are now. [BOOS] The United States Senate Subcommittee on Immigration estimates that Hillarys plan would mean [roughly 620,000 refugees](URL from all current refugee-sending nations in her first term , assuming no cuts to other refugee programs - so it could get worse! This would be additional to all other non-refugee immigration. Unbelievable numbers. Unbelievable numbers.

[BOOS, LAUGHTER] And you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to Germany and the people of Germany. [Crime has risen](URL to levels that no one thought they would ever, ever see.

[APPLAUSE] The Fort Hood shooter delivered a presentation to a [room full of mental health experts](URL before the attacks in which he threw out one red flag after another.

There will be very serious consequences. [APPLUASE] Similar to the effort to take down the mafia, this will be the understood mission of every federal investigator and prosecutor in the country. [APPLAUSE] To accomplish a goal, you must state a mission. The support networks for radical Islam in this country will be stripped out and removed, one-by-one, viciously if necessary - viciously if necessary. Immigration offices will also have their powers restored. Those have been taken away. Those who are guests in our country that are preaching hate will be asked to return home immediately and if they dont immediately, we will return them home. To make America safe again, we must work together again. Our victory in the Cold War relied on a bipartisan and international consensus. That is what we must have to defeat radical Islamic terrorism. [APPLAUSE] But just like we couldnt defeat communism without acknowledging that communism exists, or explaining its horrible evils, we cant defeat radical Islamic terrorism unless we do the exact same thing. We have to explain that it exists, and explain the difficulties. We have to have a leader that can do that, and we do not have that now. But this also means that we have to promote the exceptional virtues of our own way of life. We have an exceptional country, an exceptional way of life. But its being tread on by sick, sick people. And expecting that as newcomers come into our society, they will likewise have respect and do the same. Pride in our institutions, our history and our values should be taught by parents and teachers and impressed upon all of those that come into our society and want to join our society. [APPLAUSE] Assimilation is not an act of hostility, but an expression of compassion. Our system of government and our American culture is the best in the world, and well produce the best outcomes for all who adopt it. [APPLAUSE, CHANTING USA-USA-USA-] Thank you. Thank you. This approach will not only make us safer, but bring us closer together as a country. Renewing the spirit of Americanism will help heal the divisions in our country, of which there are so many. We have a divider as president. We call him the Great Divider. Its the thing he best. [APPLAUSE] It will do so by emphasizing what we have in common, not what pulls us apart. This is my pledge to the American People: as your president, I will be your single greatest champion. I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally and honored equally. [APPLAUSE] We will reject bigotry and hatred, and oppression, in all of its ugly forms, and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American People. Only this way will we make America great again, and safe again, for everyone. Thank you very much, God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
