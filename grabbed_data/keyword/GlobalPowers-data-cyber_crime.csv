0,cyber crime,GlobalPowers,[MILESTONE] Banks; The beating heart of an economy,1,hcwc0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/hcwc0j/milestone_banks_the_beating_heart_of_an_economy/,2020-06-21 09:37:57,"The economy is like a human body. Money flows, like blood, in a circular motion. Then, like a body, the economy requires blood and organs to properly function. In a modern economy, money flows via people spending. They are the lifeblood of the economy. Policies that help determine the shape of the economy form the brain, ensuring that the economy moves in the right direction and benefits all in it. Finally, the heart of the economy. The organ that keeps it pumping at all times; banks. Banks have been an important institution in Nigeria since its inception as a country. The first true corporation to be founded in Nigeria was the First Bank of Nigeria. Banks are crucial to its financial success and Nigerian Bankers are some of the finest on the continent. Corruption in banking is, then, akin to a heart disease. Capable of harmfully hindering the function and health of the economic body. Nigeria is infamous for its corruption scams in the financial sector, particularly for ""419 fraud"", a name which references code 419 which allows such banking and advanced fee fraud to happen. It is safe to say that an archaic banking and financial code has not contributed to the health and growth of the Nigerian economy. There have been calls for banking reforms for years and although some changes have been sanctioned, implementation has been nothing short of snail-like. A lot of government money is also lost in the banking systems at the hands of skilled accountants who, for a fee, help their clients get away with what is daylight robbery. The government has a role to play but so does the private sector. Enterprising and concerned entrepreneurs have developed innovative ideas that could, if properly applied, help ensure that the Nigerian banking systems is less corrupt and less corruptible. Electronic banking, e-pay, and cashless flow monitoring have long since been seen as ways in which to prevent fiscal crime and money laundering. In a different aspect, the economic and financial crimes commission, while working well these days, should be focused on cooperating with private firms in order to protect the wealth of Nigeria and its citizens. As part of the government strategy to build a robust and secure online banking network, the government and a number of key players have funded the development of an cyber security fund, to be paid to start-ups and entrepreneurs who have viable and smart solutions for securing cyber trade and the digital economy. The money, funded from listed sources, as well as government and private contracts will be awarded to firms and these private firms will help to ensure that safe and secure electronic banking, and security solutions, can be rolled out to even the most remote locations. Additionally, those providing security based solutions will work closely with the EFCC to ensure that financial crimes are caught more frequently, more effectively and more expediently. In conjunction with cyber aspects of the police force, the government will deploy a rapid string of corruption busts at all levels to fully weed out the deeply rooted financial crime in Nigeria - a plague on its growth and peoples happiness. &amp;#x200B; \[Milestone 4 of 12 complete\]"
1,cyber crime,GlobalPowers,[DIPLOMACY] Money Solves All Problems,1,hge2m5,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/hge2m5/diplomacy_money_solves_all_problems/,2020-06-27 05:20:51,"#Beijing, China ###Ministry of Foreign Affairs In addition to the various terms which we have already presented to the DPRK: &gt;We commit to only supplying both sides with defensive equipment, we will drop any further supply of offensive equipment at this time. &gt;Removal from the nuclear umbrella for both nations, if it is true that ROK has acquired a nuclear warhead we must be prepared for the fact this may escalate to a nuclear war in the region, we cannot let this expand into a nuclear exchange between ourselves. &gt;China removes its recent troop and equipment deployments to North Korea, the USA will do the same with South Korea. We would also like to take a few more proactive steps into making the DPRK less of a political pariah, and providing the Republic of Korea with less ammunition to run propaganda against the DPRK. Of the various terms, we find the following most notable especially considering the recent South Korean strike on the Chongjin Labor Camp: &gt;That all sides decry in the harshest possible terms the actions of both Koreas, the human rights abuses of the North and the aggression of the South and seek to ensure both sides commit to ending such actions. While we ourselves, do not really care about these camps, westerners tend to get their panties in a knot over this kind of thing, and truthfully, it can be a little hard to defend sometimes. We believe it is critical that North Korea should perhaps reduce the harshness of these camps, and we offer the following plan: * Reducing the work hours of hard labor in such camps, and reducing the use of force against such prisoners. Realistically, starving prisoners and then working to death is just giving the Republic of Korea more ammunition for its arsenal of propaganda. * Creating more tiers within the North Korean justice system, where political prisoners are of course still punished, but that hard labor as a punishment for such a crime be removed, and instead be reserved only for the DPRKs worst criminals, or western spies. * Reducing the punishments for minor crimes such as petty theft so that they require jail time, but not placement into the brutal labor camps of North Korea. * The construction of 15 new prisons across North Korea, which will be modeled after Chinese prisons in municipal areas; large dreary, colorless buildings, made to house thousands of prisoners. Along with this, we recommend the closure of most if not all North Korean prison camps. These prisons would be geared towards less dangerous offenders, and would have multiple security layers to prevent an escape. Plus, building large prison buildings for prisoners, rather than camps makes it a lot harder for the watchful eyes of the west to catch anything going wrong, and the DPRK could still take advantage of prison labor much like prisons in the United States do, while paying pennies a day for labor, which would then make it harder for criticism to be thrown at the DPRK. While we know this may not be especially popular among the DPRK elite, we are willing to front most, if not all costs for such a program, to shield our ally from whiney westerners. We are willing to pay for the construction of all these new prisons, and to provide training for North Korean prison guards on how to strike fear into prison populations without killing them. Furthermore, we are willing to provide the prisoners in North Korea's system with 3 meals a day, every day, of similar standard to prison food in China, which will be bought from food vendors in China. As part of this, the DPRK can openly proclaim the end to what western nations have declared concentration camps in a positive propaganda move, that will surely shine a positive light on Kim Jong Un and the North Korean leadership. We also suggest decrying continued South Korean aggression, and for the DPRK to continue to place a strong emphasis on the fact that it has not attempted any offensive measures in decades. Finally, we would like to strongly encourage the DPRK to surrender its nuclear weapons to the Peoples Republic of China, in an act of good faith, and as a bold PR move. We guarantee the DPRK, that under our mutual defense treaties, should the Republic of Korea ever dare to launch an invasion of the DPRK that they will be met with the full brunt of the Chinese armed forces, and we will not let the government of Pyongyang fall. If you were to surrender your nuclear warheads to us, we will take them to China, where they will be safely stored, but not fully deactivated, so that the DPRK will know its nuclear weapons will never be too far out of reach, especially if the Republic of Korea launches a full fledged nuclear program. Finally, following the surrender of these weapons, an IAEA tour would reveal that the DPRK would have no nuclear weapons, and the world will have its full attention on the evil actions of South Korea. We know we ask for a lot, but we have an extensive offering prepared to entice the DPRK into accepting such terms. #Military Assistance, Donations, and Training for the DPRK: While we will not sell offensive equipment to the DPRK, what we can do is commit to overhauling the defensive equipment of the DPRK, while providing some under the table funds for North Korea to focus on developing its own offensive equipment rather than buying it from abroad. We are interested in providing the DPRK a multi-year, multi-billion dollar upgrade program, with vital equipment being prioritized for delivery: ###Cyber Security: Over the next five years, we will commit $1 billion in additional aid to the complete overhaul of the North Korean government and military's computer systems, through a joint initiative in which we will provide brand new computers, as well as cyber security measures and training to the DPRK. This will include providing the latest and greatest in networking equipment, and establishing much more modern and secure communication methods for the entire DPRK military and government. ###Radar: Given the nature of the South Korean incursion into the DPRK, we are interested in revamping the full radar coverage of the DPRK, on the condition that these radars be linked and accessible to Chinese air command to serve as an extended early warning system. The following would be built all across the DPRK to provide as good of detection capabilities as we can provide: ###OTH-B, or Over the Horizon Backscatter Radar: Designed to provide radar coverage for extensive distances, we would like to build seven OTH-B installations in the DPRK, one to cover the border with South Korea, and three on each coast of the DPRK, to detect any potential future naval incursions, such as the one used to attack the Chonjin labor camp. These fixed installations will be a few hundred meters in length for their transmitter arrays, and have 3 kilometers of receiver array faces, with these radar being linked and working in concert with Chinese satellite constellations. ###SW-OTH Radar: We would like to build three Surface Wave Over the Horizon radar installations for the KPA, with one being built to cover the southern border, and one to cover each coast of the DPRK., which will each provide tracking at ranges of up to 500 kilometers at low levels, including ships, a well as sea-skimming and low altitude cruise missiles, including hypersonic targets. ###JL3D-90B: We would like to build at least 10 JL3D-90B radar stations across the DPRK, which will be massive installations that will provide the KPA Air Force with target discrimination and selection in 3D, at a range of 500 kilometers, and up to 25 kilometers high. ###TMD-QR: The TMD-QR quantum radar vehicle allows the ability to detect and target stealthy, hypersonic, and in general difficult to intercept targets. This will be crucial in preventing and defending against future incursions by the South Korean air force, and we would like to donate 32 of these vehicles, and will train the KPAAF on their operation and maintenance. ###JY-19 Long Range Radar Vehicle, TMD-J: The LLQ302 25 meter wide radar tracks targets flying as high as 75,000 feet, and at 590 kilometers away. We would like to donate the construction of 15 stationary sites of this radar in the DPRK. ###HZX-366TMD Space Surveillance Radar: Considering potential intelligence on the Republic of Korea potentially building nuclear weapons, and their possession of hypersonic missiles, we would like to build an early warning system in North Korea, which will be accessible to both North Korean and Chinese command. We propose building four permanent space surveillance stations in the DPRK, once again with China providing training on the operation and maintenance of such facilities. #Military Donations: We will be allocating a total of $10 billion dollars from the PLA procurement budget to make defensive donations of defensive equipment to the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, which will come in the form of SAM defenses, laser defenses, and AEW&amp;C aircraft. We would like to donate the following: * 6 Batteries of HQ-19 SAMs, to be delivered immediately, with another 2 batteries to be donated per year for the next three years. * 4 Batteries of HQ-19T SAMs, specialized in intercepting ballistic missiles, with an additional 2 per year for the next three years. * 32 LW-200 Laser defense systems, to be delivered over the course of 5 years * 64 LW-50 laser defense vehicles, to be delivered over the course of 5 years. * 10 Hx-21 Maritime Patrol Aircraft, with 5 being donated immediately and the rest delivered next year. * 10 KJ-3000 AEW&amp;C Aircraft, to be delivered immediately. ###Military Training: While we have agreed to remove all troops from North Korea, in exchange for the United States withdrawing from South Korea, we see no reason as to why we cant host Korean soldiers in China through a Sino-Korean friendship program, whereas instead of sending advisors to North Korea, North Korea can send soldiers for training exercises into China. These exercises will see North Korth korean soldiers receive training from Chinese advisors within China, under the guise of joint exercises. Additionally, should DPRK forces take home modern assault rifles and infantry kits which we will provide during these cooperative exercises, well we can't really stop them *wink wink*. ###Economic Investment and Food Aid: We have substantial capital that can be provided to the development of North Korea, which would not only raise standards of living, but provide a significant boost to government approval in the DPRK, enough to withstand any potential propaganda upgrade. In many states that have collapsed, such as Yugoslavia, Syria, and any number of regimes around the world, economic woes have always been one of the key downfalls of such governments. In exchange for the full denuclearization of North Korea, and the reform of the labor camp system, and allowing Chinese companies to access North Korean resources and markets freely. Specifically, for a loosening of DPRK restrictions to allow Chinese state owned companies to bring the capital and technology to fully take advantage of the DPRKs wealth of natural resources, while still keeping the DPRK's markets relatively closed, and bringing tens of thousands of jobs, paying higher wages to the DPRK. If the government of North Korea agrees, we can bring the DPRK the following: * $5 billion in food aid per year, for the next five years. * $50 billion dollars over the next 5 years to renew, modernize, and expand North Korean infrastructure. * Up to 200 billion dollars in investments into the North Korean economy over the next 10 years, directed by Chinese state owned companies, provided you make a special exception for chinese companies in North Korean law that would allow Chinese companies access to the highly restricted natural resources of the DPRK. * A personal guarantee to shelter the entire Kim family, and any DPRK government officials in China forever, should the worst ever happen in the DPRK. ###Conclusion All of this aid can be delivered to the DPRK, if you accept our terms, for the sake of your own survival, to halt South Korean dickwaving, and to prevent a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula. We will not abandon you, but nuclear weapons must not remain on the Korean peninsula, and the labor camps going would really make it easier to make South Korea the bad guy. Seriously, take our money."

Foreign and domestic individuals and companies operating in or planning to invest in Iran and the Iranian worker face staggering levels of corruption. Massively powerful systems of political patronage, nepotism, and cronyism are seen at every level of the economy, in all sectors. Payments and bribes are often exchanged in order to obtain services, permits, and public contracts, and despite the multitude of laws in place which criminalize various forms of corruption in public and private sectors, the Islamists in power have shown that they are not beholden to the very laws they create. The issue is the Islamists and their proxies, such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and once they are gone, our Revolutionary nation must undergo a great upheaval to restructure the economic, judicial, administrative, and legislative systems to form a bulwark against corruption. &amp;nbsp; Given the massive extent to which the system of governance in Iran is broken, and the need to readjust and modify nearly all aspects of the current government, when the National Front speaks or makes statements regarding corruption, they will nearly always be embedded in larger reforms within say, the judiciary, or the military. In general, however, in our effort to eliminate corruption, we will focus on three things: &amp;nbsp; * Restriction of capital punishment to corruption and treason only; * Expansion of government wages (including those serving in the military) to deter the need to take bribes; * Creation of an anti-corruption ministry to work independently of the other ministries to counter corruption; and, * The stigmatization and shaming of those who engage in corrupt activities through public lashings equivalent to their crime. &amp;nbsp; The creation of the **Ministry of Anti-Corruption** will help the Revolutionary government have a centralized force against corruption in all parts of the government. An independent ministry, it will be responsible for doing routine checks throughout all parts of the government and the economy, reporting breaches of the law and enforcing lashings and possible executions of those found out to be engaging in forms of corruption. &amp;nbsp; ---- ---- &amp;nbsp; **JUDICIAL &amp; JUSTICE SYSTEM** &amp;nbsp; At the moment, in Iran, there is a high risk of corruption and political interference when dealing with the judicial system and legal matters. Putting aside the Islamic and corrupt nature of the current legal code, even the staunchest of Islamist hardliners in the Islamic Consultive Assembly have admitted that the system is broken, and we must unfortunately agree with them. The corruption within the system, however, is entirely the making of these very same hardliners, and the reformists that came before them sporting little to no spine. In the Iranian judicial system, executives of small, publicly owned companies report that bribes and payments are frequently exchanged in return for obtaining favorable court decisions. The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran suggests that the government maintains a separation of powers, but in practice, it is never upheld. While the judiciary is supposedly independent from the executive branch, the illegitimate Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei holds absolute power over the courts. How is the current judiciary any different than the sham courts manned by the Shahs SAVAK before the Revolution? They are in no way any different. In fact, judgements in politically sensitive cases are often resolved by the intelligence services themselves! The rich and corrupt politicians and clergymen of the regime protect their own through the power of the courts, sparing rich and influential individuals from truly fair prosecutions. And when people speak out about corruption, they are arrested and questioned. An entirely new system must be made. &amp;nbsp; Once the Revolution is underway, the Iranian National Front will be quick to establish a new **Ministry of Justice** to pick up and rebuild the ruins which the Islamists have left behind. Vested with the responsibility to investigate and pass judgement on grievances, to uphold the law of the state, and to uncover crimes and to prosecute criminals, the Ministry of Justice will form the executive side of law enforcement and will represent the Iranian government in legal matters. The Ministry of Justice will also maintain control over the Iranian Republic Law Enforcement IRLE, unless both the executive and the legislative branches agree to transferring control temporarily of the IRLE to the Defense Forces. The Minister of Justice will be the head of the ministry, and will be nominated by the President and approved by the legislative branch. The Ministry of Justice will then maintain administrative control over the following divisions and agencies: &amp;nbsp; * **Criminal Division:** Responsible for the enforcement of investigation of the application of all criminal laws within Iran; * **Civil Rights Division:** Responsible for the enforcement of and investigation of legal statutes prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, sexuality, gender, disability, religion, national origin, and so on within Iran; * **Financial Division:** Responsible for the enforcement of and investigation of financial matters, including fraud, corruption, tax, and non-compliance with legislation relating to the economy; * **Environmental Division:** Responsible for the enforcement of and investigation of breaches of civil and criminal law relating to the environment; and, * **National Security Division:** Responsible for the enforcement of and investigation of matters relating to national security, mainly treason, spying, and cybersecurity. Works in integration with the Ministry of Intelligence and Iranian Republic Cyber Command. &amp;nbsp; The judicial system itself must now be covered as well. The **Courts of the Iranian Republic** will be a completely separate branch from the executive, unlike the Ministry of Justice. Responsible for the interpretation of the law and the hearings of cases (civil and criminal alike), the new Iranian court structure will include a Supreme Court and a variety of smaller, less powerful courts. These courts will operate off of an adversarial system, where two advocates will represent their parties case or position before an impartial person or group of people, be it a judge or jury, who are given the responsibility of passing judgement accordingly. The Supreme Court of Iran itself will be made up of nine judges, all nominated by the president and confirmed by the legislative branch, and will serve for no more than ten years each. This court will be built in Tehran, and will be the highest judicial power in the country. &amp;nbsp; ---- ----"
4,cyber crime,GlobalPowers,[EVENT] Hong Kong inaugurates the Victim Hall.,4,buq9cs,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/buq9cs/event_hong_kong_inaugurates_the_victim_hall/,2019-05-30 17:27:45,"#Hong Kong inaugurates the Victim Hall. **May, 2031** --- In a small series of anti-triad related campaigns, the government is officially inaugurating the 'Victim Hall', located in Shenzen. The Hall is specially created to showcase how many people are victims of the Triads daily, monthly and yearly. It is completely free to roam the Hall, where eight ATM-like machines are free to be used by anyone to browse a list of almost 10,000 deceased people, victims of the Triads. In preparation for this, the government has contacted 9,429 families regarding their family member appearing in the database. Most of them accepted, with only 1,254 complete rejects. The government, of course, paid the families for their troubles, spending over 94,290,000HKD (USD $12,500,000) for the database alone. The machines themselves will be heavy monitoring for any cyber attacks, as the government believes the Triads will try and take the hall down. The hall will be guarded by 19 guards, equipped with firearms. The machines offer a browsable and searchable list, with specific profiles for most persons, documenting their age, picture and what happened to them. Each profile will also have a DONATE button which will directly transfer 95% of the income to the family's bank account. Chief Executive Carrie Lam inaugurated the Hall with a speech: --- **""The Victim Hall, before everything is made for remembering the ones who had to suffer because of the Triads, people who completely did not deserve to be mercilessly punished by cold-blooded killers. The hall will remain open 12/24, and the government will gain no money whatsoever from it. We instead have given the families of the victims' generous amounts for their troubles and have implemented a donate button on the machines so you can directly donate to them yourselves. Along with this, I'd like to declare that the Organized Crime and Triad Bureau will receive a 10% increase in budget to be able to continue finding, arresting and serving justice to these criminals."" ---"
5,cyber crime,GlobalPowers,[SECRET] Censorship and National Security in Saudi Arabia,2,bh8tkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/bh8tkw/secret_censorship_and_national_security_in_saudi/,2019-04-25 23:46:18,"## Ministry of Media -   **12th MAY 2026** *Riyadh, Saudi Arabia* ---- ### Current Censorship The Law of Printing and Publication, enacted in 2003, expanded upon the regulation of media, encompassing books, drawings, writings, photographs, films, recordings, radio and television broadcasts. The current law, which is enforced by the Ministry of Culture and Information, requires government licensing for any of the aforementioned activities. It lays out a series of restrictions, including that the printed matter will not conflict with Sharia law, will not threaten public security, and will not ""stir up discord among citizens."" Though this law was written in the context of print media, it also extends to electronic media. In 2007, the Saudi government issued an Anti-Cyber Crimes Law, which lists cyber crimes that can result in imprisonment and fines. The law specifically prohibits content that negatively impacts public order, religious values, public morals, and privacy, ""through the information network or computers,"" which can include content that promotes drug use, pornography, gambling, or terrorism. Failing to abide by these rules would result in large fines, removal of the content, and potentially closure of the establishment responsible, along with suspending or banning the person or group from future publishing. In charging individuals with violations, the government often applies these laws, sometimes in conjunction with counter-terrorism laws. These laws extend the definition of terrorism to include content that is damaging to Saudi Arabia, its reputation, stability, and security. Saudi Arabia directs all international Internet traffic through a proxy farm located in King Abdulaziz City for Science &amp; Technology. A content filter is implemented there, where a number of sites are blocked according to two lists maintained by the Internet Services Unit (ISU): one containing ""immoral"" (mostly pornographic or supportive of LGBT-rights) sites and sites promoting Shia Ideology, the others based on directions from a security committee run by the Ministry of Information (including sites critical of the Saudi government). ## New Censorship law A new law proposed by the Lower House and subject to the necessary screening by the Higher House has been approved by Royal decree. The new law outlines a more relaxed censorship and liberalizes the media by enforcing the inability to apply terrorism laws with censorship laws. With this, media outlets will only be charged at most with hefty fines and if a recurred offense temporary closure. The overall censorship scope has been reduced, completely censoring homosexual, Shia religion and inflammatory critique of the Saudi government. Other pornographic and immoral content will also be censored, however the firewall will not block proxy traffic towards these topics and filters will be relaxed. The government believes this will continue to please the conservative religious sector of Saudi Arabia, and at the same time reduce the overall rape and violence crime incidence in the Kingdom. Topics can be actively added to the filter, removing content that the a Committee can deem threatening to national security. As a result, most websites will now be accessible to the regular user. ## SECRET: SAUDI BIG-BROTHER The relaxation of the censorship laws comes with a price to Saudi citizens. Instead of actively preventing people accessing content, the government has moved towards a global scale surveillance system akin to the Chinese ""Social Credit System"". All traffic incoming and outgoing Saudi Arabia will have to pass via the new King Abdulaziz Central Surveillance HQ, where it will be subjected to large scale data analytics. The infrastructure will of course require a large expansion to cope with the data processing from this traffic, together with other data collected from other sources such as video and audio surveillance, with full scale lifestyle monitoring including purchases with credit cards and movements with transit cards. The system will automatically rank user according to their threat level which can then be followed by the Saudi Internal Intelligence Service. Several foreign contractors will be called to implement this system."

Firstly, all political prisoners, who have not committed any crime other than being an enemy to the previous regime, will be released immediately. No compensation will be given and they will continue to be watched closely by the authorities, but they will be granted back their freedom at last. Censorship laws will be relaxed. Currently, it is illegal for media to report on things that can be deemed ""unturkish"" and things that encourage separatist thought. Both these legal articles will be repealed. However, being a member of a terrorist organisation as well as inciting hatred and violence will remain illegal. All media companies shut down by emergency decrees will be allowed to reopen. The goal of this relaxation is to increase press freedom to better western standards. The country will commit fully to secularism, destroying the Directorate of Religious Affairs, which only served to fund government money into Islam. With a staff of 150'000 and a budget on par of that of the Interior, removing this ministry from the books will represent a significant freeing up both in spending and in thought. Henceforth, Mosques in Turkey will be either self-funded through charity or receive funding from lower levels of government. However, to ease the burden on Imams which will no longer receive funding, they will be eligible to receive welfare. Education spending will be given higher priority, with specific goals of getting more women into lower and higher education and achieving 100% literacy rate for under 18s. In terms of economics, Turkey requires a new industrial revolution to push the country into a cyber golden age. Though some economic reforms of this ilk were passed previously, the new government hopes for greater results this term. Taxes will be cut on all small businesses as well as medium sized businesses in the IT sector. Grants will be granted to media producing companies, such as animation studios, video game developers, and theatres to produce Turkish content made by Turkish employees. Finally, a massive tourism campaign will be initiated, with a budget of $100 million to advertise tourism to Turkey in Europe, Russia, the Gulf States, the US, Canada, and Australia."

Turkey dominates the land, sea, and airspace of the surrounding region and the Turkish president is not orange enough to care about space any more than necessary. However, the cyber component of the Turkish national defence is lacking. Currently, the National Security Council of Turkey is the chief administrator of the nations intelligence defence, composed principally of the National Intelligence Organisation, alongside smaller intelligence agencies. The National Intelligence Organisation will be receiving additional funding this year to ensure the cyber defence and cyber warfare departments are adequately funded, and additional talent is able to join their ranks. The Turkish government is therefore seeking hackers and cybersecurity experts to join their intelligence agencies. Alongside more conventional means of talent acquisition, Turkey is also offering a bounty of 5000 lira or a job offer to anyone who finds bugs within any gov.tr website or any other government server. This will attract the best and brightest, be they script kiddies or old experts. Naturally, it will no longer be a crime to hack a government website if the bug is reported, privately, through official channels, to the intelligence services of Turkey. The hope is that this will ensure the NIO is a strong and competently staffed intelligence agency with a strong background in cyber security and cyber defence, staffed by enthusiastic and passionate individuals with a love for penetration testing. The NIO will continue its mandate of defending Turkey through proactive cyber defence, ensuring the elections are not meddled with by foreign powers, ensuring the countries networks are not vulnerable to attack, and ensuring the national government cannot be infiltrated."

9,cyber crime,GlobalPowers,[CONFLICT] Increasing pressure against Ukraine,5,8fph80,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/8fph80/conflict_increasing_pressure_against_ukraine/,2018-04-29 15:33:49,"Russias strategy in Ukraine has largely been to bring about Russias escalation dominance over Ukraine for the foreseeable future. Its main objectives have been to force NATO to succumb to Ukraine fatigue and accept the status quo, permitting another frozen conflict in Europe to avoid agitating Russia. As eight years pass by with the borders between the Ukrainian government and the separatists unchanging, NATO has largely accepted this outcome. Europe has also fallen into a financial crisis in 2022 allowing Russia more leverage at this time. With Russian short term plans complete, a more aggressive action can be undertaken to restore Ukraine to its rightful sphere of influence ####Military buildup around Ukraine Throughout the 2010s Russian forces began developing its military infrastructure around Ukraine providing better positioned to conduct an incursion or threaten regime change in Kiev. It stations around 30,000 troops in Crimea, and around 80,000 troops permanent forces along the Ukrainian border. The time and distance required to go from readiness check to combat deployment will be so narrow that Russian forces could be across the Ukrainian border before anyone is the wiser. Russia has also concentrated its most technologically advanced equipments across the Ukraine ready to spring into action. ####Controlled instability through hybrid warfare The point however isnt only military action. The Kremlin concludes that controlled instability is the ideal tool for controlling the neighbourhood and, by extension, containing Europe and the West. The chaos it created prevented Euro-Atlantic institutions from enlarging further and made European stabilisation of the immediate neighbourhood a costly affair that prevented the West from applying its tools elsewhere. Accepting the Donbas as a frozen conflict was the optimal result for Russia. To ensure that Ukraine falls into instability Russia will now perform hybrid warfare moves to paint Ukraine as a failed state. The resumption of an endless war will begin with Pro-Russian separatist groups bringing back the Ukrainian conflict back to the news by launching a major offensive. Given the EUs tire and Russian threats of military intervention, the Ukraine will not be an attractive place for businesses. The Ukrainian authorities will be forced to spend their attention on security over their economy. On the Ukrainian side, a barrage of malware, denial of service attacks, and phishing campaigns bombard Ukraines critical infrastructure environments on a daily basis. Occasional well-planned and sophisticated attack on Ukraines electrical grid targeted power distribution centers and leave Ukrainians without power the day during the Winter, similar to what occurred in December 2015 where the attackers were able to override operators password access to the system and disable backup generators. Another aspect is to increase criminality rates. Orders are sent out to connect organised crime networks, the pro Russian anti-government opposition, and titushki hooligan clubs into creating even more instability and corruption. Donbas will be permitted to become sanctuaries for money laundering, forgery, and cyber-crime. The spread of these activities not only destabilised Ukraine, but also give birth to tension between Brussels and Kiev, on controlling their growing crime rates. ####Desired outcome The stalemate in economic progress to focus on security needs hinder the diversification of trade relations and Ukraine remains dependent on the Russian market, which provides an opening for Moscow to exert influence on key oligarchs. European businesses lose interest in the Ukrainian market due to high levels of corruption, unfriendly business climate, and lack of security. Ukraine suffers from extensive brain-drain, under-investment, unemployment, and economic stagnation. While Russia does not have the resources to replace the investment of European businesses, the status quo means that Kiev is unable to move towards the West. This kind of controlled and ambiguous instability serves the Kremlin well because it neither has to directly manage Ukraine, nor expose itself to Western criticism for subduing the country with military force. Still, it can delegitimise the EU as a stabilising force in the neighbourhood and beyond, and dissuade Europeans from trying to further engage in other countries on Russias periphery. Additionaly given the economic strife in Ukraine, Russia seeks to delegitimise the Ukrainian government. Russia seeks to wear down the pro-EU Ukrainians to accept their fate that Russia will always be their most influential neighbour. If they want to improve their living standards they have to relent on their pro-EU stance and cooperate with Russia and her interests. Russia will seek to go for discussions with the EU regarding a Ukraine conflict resolution where Ukraine remains firmly in Russias sphere of influence and that sanctions are removed against Russia, lest they permit the endless war to continue. *** **As is tradition Russia denies everything.** "

The United Kingdom will officially leave the European Union on March 29, 2019. However, there will be a 21 month transition period in which the UK will not have voting rights within the EU, but will be subject to all EU rules and regulations. This will allow businesses to adjust, and will provide a longer window for negotiations over Brexit. The United Kingdom will also be permitted to sign trade deals with other nations during this period, so long as those deals do not come into effect until after the transition period is over. The most critical aspect of this deal is the ""backstop"" agreement as pertains to Northern Ireland. Should a deal not be reached by the time the transition period ends, Northern Ireland will remain within the EU customs union. All parties agree that there can be no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland under any circumstances. On January 1st, 2021, the United Kingdom will no longer be subject to European Union law. We should endeavor to reach a deal by then, but it remains very possible that the EU is unable to negotiate satisfactory terms by that point. As the Brexit negotiations will set the standard for any future Article 50 negotiations, it is in the interest of the EU to reach an agreement as favorable to it as possible. The EU will maintain its policy that no deal will be signed until we reach agreement on all points, and while we will be flexible in negotiations, we should be prepared to hold out for a more favorable deal. The European Union has far greater leverage than the United Kingdom does in these negotiations, and we should not be afraid to wield it. With all that said, we would like to review the EU's negotiating points with all our partners. ##IRELAND * Border should be seamless and frictionless as possible * Border must be able to address smuggling concerns. * Given concerns that technology may be inadequate to address smuggling concerns, the EU currently proposes moving customs controls to seaports and airports, rather than anywhere near the land border. ##THE ECJ The European Court of Justice will be the governing body which manages issues arising from citizens rights, as well as adjudicating issues arising from the execution of the ultimate Brexit deal. ##RESIDENCY * Guaranteed continued permanent residency for all individuals currently with permanent residency status, and guarantee that nationals arriving in the EU or the UK before the cut-off date will be able to attain permanent residency after five years of continuous residency. * All EU students in the UK and all UK students in the EU will be permitted to maintain residency until completion of their current degree path. * Britons living in the EU will not have any right to onward movement within the EU, for example to work or study in a neighboring member state. * Britons living in the EU will not have any right to vote or stand in local elections while living in the EU, as such a right comes with European Union citizenship * As per Directive 2004/38, to expel a permanent resident for criminal activity, the personal conduct of the individual concerned must represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society. * Family members as defined in Directive 2004/38 who accompany or join the EU citizen after the date of withdrawal may continue to benefit from rights of residence under same provisions as current family members. ##DIVORCE BILL * The UK will pay 85 billion to the European Union. This includes, but is not limited to, funds for the following: 1. British contributions to the EU budget for 2019 and 2020 1. UKs share of the EUs unpaid bills 1. Pensions for EU officials 1. Loan guarantees to Greece and Ukraine 1. Money promised to Syrian refugees in Turkey 1. Schemes aimed at stopping migration from Africa ##TRADE * Teresa Mays government has already decided not to pursue Single Market access. Any further trade deal is to take place after Brexit negotiations are completed. * Transition deal has been created for this purpose, to give UK companies buffer time after Brexit to allow a new trade deal to be put in place. ##CRIME AND SECURITY * The United Kingdom will no longer have access to the following. Access is dependent on EU membership 1. European Arrest Warrant (EAW) process, under which criminal suspects can be speedily extradited between EU states 1. Europol, an EU agency that coordinates continent-wide crime-fighting operations and the exchange of intelligence 1. Second Generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), which issues alerts to officers and border staff about suspects, foreign fighters and missing people * Beyond these privileges, all parties agree to maintain cooperation on issues of terrorism, rogue states, and cyber security ##FISHING * The EU Common Fisheries Policy will remain in force, and EU fishing fleets will be permitted to fish in UK waters. ##AGRICULTURE * UK farmers will no longer receive EU subsidies for their crops ##AVIATION RIGHTS * Aviation rights must be reciprocal.

The ""dirty dossier"" uncovered by the Netherlands currently remains a secret. **Saudi Arabia** During a speech given by the crown prince at one of the mega hotels in Riydah, a gunman attempted to assassinate him by running at the stage with a handgun. The man was restrained by the princes body guards, and kept screaming ""death to the imperialists, free the Houthi people!"". He now remains in custody pending sentencing. **Latvia** A high level intelligence operation by the CIA has compiled a list of connections between political parties and figures in the country to Moscow. These include donations to pro-Russian parties, support for extreme pro-Russian groups and speakers as well as some links to major organised crime in Latvia. As well as this, the CIA has provable evidence that members of the pro-Russian leftist party in Latvia have held meetings with several senior figures in the Russian government since 2016. **South Korea** North Korean intelligence has run large operation in South Korea to identify the locations of various defectors in the country. Several high profile defectors who have publicly come out with information about the secretive northern state have been located and are currently being tracked.... **Burundi** A number of military officials have been arrested after a raid on a meeting of conspirators planning to attempt to oust the President. Those arrested include several high level figures in the FDN all of which are accused of conspiracy to coup the President. **Macedonia** The Macedonian government has accused Bulgaria of attempting to influence and even destabalise the nation amid claims they have evidence that Bulgarian cyber groups have attempted to forge information on corruption in the country and hand it to a pro-Bulgarian political party to come out with. Macedonia has publicly come out with this information and has stated it will take action against Bulgaria if necessary. **Caribbean Netherlands** A government internal affairs investigation by the Netherlands into actives in the Caribbean Netherlands islands was exposed today after an embarrassing leak was made public by several politicians in the Caribbean. Seeking to smear the government, the opposition which had gained access to the leaks made public that an investigation by the Netherlands government has obtained evidence of mass corruption by the Caribbean governments, including slush funds, tax havens and money laundering. The Netherlands government has yet to make a statement on the issue however it is seen as a major blow for public confidence in the Caribbean territories which appear to be abusing financing from the national government. **Syria** Operatives from the AFID have tracked several Mossad agents in the capital, arranging a meeting with them in private to discuss something of mutual benefit. At the highly tense meeting which was close to erupting into a gunfight several times, Syrian agents gave their Mossad counterparts access to a dossier revealing information on the new Iranian military base being built in the country. The AFID suggested that the Syrian government has begun to become highly concerned regarding the future of Iranian influence in Syria post-war and is willing to aid Israeli operations against Iran in exchange for Israel turning more of a blind eye towards the Assad regime in order to help both parties...."

Now, as you are no doubt aware as one of the Republic of China's most important strategic allies, - having sold us numerous sets of military equipment in the past, including the *La Fayette*-Class Guided Missile Frigates in the 1990s, which have proved to be an invaluable asset in controlling the Formosa Strait, and defending our waters - that the ROC Navy has been developing a program to produce eight new, advanced Diesel-Electric submarines (SSKs) with haste, as we are in desperate need of replacing our *Balao*-Class and *Zwaardvis*-Class submarines with new ships capable of silently defending our shores from foreign encroachment. President Tsai Ing-wen and Admiral Huang Shu-kuang have instructed me to pass on a message to President Emmanuel Macron regarding this matter of utmost secrecy for the sake of a continued Franco-Chinese (Taiwanese) friendship. President Tsai Ing-wen has filed a request at the behest of the Ministry of Defense to silently purchase schematics which would prove integral to the future of the ROCN's Silent Service. First on the list are modern Torpedo Tube designs. We have sought out French designs as a unique variant throughout the modern world, which are also the easiest to manufacture and cheapest to maintain. French tubes operate via pistons and hydraulics, as opposed to air or water pressure, saving valuable resources and money which could be spent elsewhere. We would like to procure the tube schematics for $1 Million USD, as they are still far too complex for us to master on our own, as there are things we still do not understand about water pressure's effects and how to counter these effects on the torpedoes. As well, the most important system of all, the Module d'Energie Sous-Marine Autonome, (MEMSA) is an Air-Independent Propulsion system we have gathered interest in, as a possible way to maintain silence as the enemy searches for our boats to no avail, providing an ability for us to turn the tide on the high seas against any threatening amphibious force. We are willing to pay $43 million for the designs of MEMSA on the condition that these schematics will not be approved for foreign sale, and only select companies in the ROC will have access to such information on a need-to-know basis. For MEMSA to be sold, it would become a closely guarded secret which we would not allow enemy Cyber Divisions to take without a fight. We suggest that if such a deal is approved, it be kept relatively silent. Of course, a statement legally has to be made by the French Government, but we suggest that if it is kept to a strategically ambiguous nature, defining ""Undersea warfare technology for purposes of defence"" as the sale, but not detailing AIP or Torpedo Tube technology.

16,cyber crime,GlobalPowers,[EVENT] Defense Minister Nakatani Gen addresses National Diet,3,6fluy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/6fluy0/event_defense_minister_nakatani_gen_addresses/,2017-06-06 23:46:43,"Contrary to popular belief, military actions and defense does not only pertain to soldiers, tanks, fighter jets, and warships. Of course, most if not all of you know this as esteemed members of the National Diet. However, this needs to be made clear. A certain country's actions using intelligence, cyberwarfare, and so-called hybrid warfare carried out against ourselves and our allies presents a legitimate threat to our national security rivaling any direct military threat. In order to fight effectively in the 21st century, we must take much more proactive measures to counter these threats, and we must not hesitate in carrying these measures out. As the Minister of Defense, I have devised a plan to effectively counter cyberespionage carried out against us. While we certainly hope to take advantage of help from our allies, we cannot rely completely on them as they have their own agendas, as proven by the NSA bugs planted on our government officials a few years back. Therefore, I devise the following plan. For security reasons, I request that we hold a meeting behind closed doors for the specifics of this plan. [M] Behind Closed doors [One of the largest points of entry for Chinese cyber attacks is through the internet cables connecting Japan with Mainland Asia. We believe that, even if it means a small loss of privacy for our citizens, we must monitor these cables and give the Defense Intelligence Headquarters full power to conduct this monitoring. Therefore, we will construct a facility for covert monitoring of all traffic flowing through these lanes and have computers process the data, looking for keywords and keyphrases, along with other data indicating foreign or domestic cyber-crime and espionage. With this, we hope to identify cyberespionage activities and take proactive measures to investigate them thoroughly. Data without any red flags will be stored for a short time, such as a month before deletion to allow authorities to look back into them for data on a new investigation.](#secret) [Data directly concerning ongoing investigations or with red flags from the processing system will be looked at more thoroughly by other machines, and by human eyes. Such personnel will be recruited from a combination of existing intelligence agencies and from other government workers, such as police and military investigators. We will also hire many personnel capable of speaking fluent Chinese, English, Korean, and Russian, in order to better look through such data.](#secret) We believe that in addition, plans should be set in motion for a more unified intelligence network, and possibly a cyber security and infrastructure protection agency. With the threat posed by foreign espionage, we sincerely believe that the proposed action must be taken. If not, we risk the security of our citizens and our national defense and civil infrastructure. We have had enough of hesitating in the name of so called privacy. We must protect our citizens from more hostile and dangerous threats than the supposed risks of our government. We have systems in place to ensure that our intelligence doesn't abuse their power. Such systems are NOT in place with foreign and criminal threats. With this, I shall end my address to the National Diet. If there are any questions, please feel free to ask them. [M]This doesn't mean random questions from Bumfuckistan. This is only for Japanese citizens and government members, aka /u/tozapeloda77 only. "
17,cyber crime,GlobalPowers,[EVENT] [Backdated] The 2020 Strategic Defense and Security Review,7,68rhqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/68rhqs/event_backdated_the_2020_strategic_defense_and/,2017-05-02 16:17:36,"#Strategic Defense and Security Review 2020 A Comprehensive five-yearly review of the UK's Defence and Security strategy, outlining points of highest recommendation to the government, for the implementation to policy. Commissioned under the Conservative government, this cross-party outline is purposed for the maximum possible security for Britain's interests across the world. ###International * Global threat still can come from a number of key locations  Central Africa, the Middle East, and East Asia have all flared in recent months and years. In order to properly address these threats, the UK's global power projection must be fully capable of exerting our influence where necessary, and backing up our strategic allies and partners where appropriate. * Terror can still come with anywhere, and our intelligence services must possess the capability to defend against them, whil retaining the privacy of law-abiding citizens. Britain needs an ironclad online security policy, and GCHQ needs continued support from government to apply pressure to those using cyber networks to conduct destabilising and illegal activities. * Drugs still a strong driver of organised crime. The SDSR 2020 recommends a comission new report into the effect of decriminalisation on the threats posed by crime and terror syndicates. * Many worrying geopolitical movements mean that we must reassert our commitment to ensure the security and safety of British Citizens living in our overseas territories. In particular, this means that the Navy fleet must be expanded, for which see below, section **Navy** ###Army * Challenger 2. LEP must be conducted immediately, and the question settled over Armoured Regimental size. By 2030, a native British design should begin production to replace it. We should seek international partners for this effort, though the EU will likely prove reticent. If the planning begins now, it will be less likely that the project will become squeezed at critical moments, defending us against the all-too-familiar budget bubbles, and cost and time overruns common to British military procurements. * Ajax. The Scout/Recon Armoured Vehicle has been a firm success, and attention must now be given to our aging fleet of IFV and APC fleet. * Army 2020 has coincided with an unscheduled (for the military) departure from the EU, and fresh questions about our ability to deploy a global force must be answered. Emphasis on Brigade-sized units landing hot into conflict zones or areas in need of support and settling, are the priority. * The staffing levels of the Army are sufering undue pressure due to sluggish recruitment. A renewed Drive to hire more soldiers is needed. ###Navy * Shipbuilding is an absolutely integral part of Post-Brexit BRitain. The successful start for the Type 26 and Type 31 Frigate programs is a credit to an outstanding industry. The Scottish yards help deepen the United Kingdom's internal integrity, as the jobs losses in the event of Scotland's prospective secession from the UK would be a sore wound to Scottish industry. In a similar vein, the hosting of the British nuclear submarine fleet in Scotland also brings thousands of jobs to Scotland, which would all depart in the event of Scottish secession. In orrder to work towards strategic defence and security in the UK, a modest increase in the planned fleet acquisitions, and some overdue LEPs would go a long way to assuring the world that BRitain's industry is open for business, and a globally competitive power. * Carriers good are completed, with final fitting out due in 2021. This enormous project must ve supported by commensurate political will to use them as the are intended. Short, medium, and long tours, are critical parts of the recouping of value from these ships. * Both frigate designs are good, and will meet our needs if priduced in sufficient numbers, see below * The River Class OPVs are outstanding and represent, along with both frigate classes, a large potebtial export industry. Britain should recruit buyers in the international community and press for exports. * Destroyers. Our Type 45 fleet is now approaching 20 years old. Their grave problems with propuksion, and their operationally insufficient missile suite, must be changed to suit our needs more fully. We must place them into a Life Extension Program, to a) Replace their propulsion systems with more comprehensively robust IEP; b) Insert 2 x 7.0m Mk41 VLS to add one, and replace one Sylver A50 VLS, so that we can incorporate strike length and ASROC missiles to the Type 45. * Cruiser? We must have more capacity to launch missiles at surface and ground targets in the fleets. A saturation attack would leave the RN too vulnerable. After the LEP for the six Type 45, a Type 45 batch II, which is issued with the upgrades, and which has an extended helicopter hangar sufficient to carry 2x Merlin AW101 helicopters, is needed. It needs to be able to carry around 100 VL Missiles. * We must expand our escort fleet by an extra 1 ship every year, ensuring our build plans for the Frigates are maintained at current rate; so that by the end of 2020 we should have 20 Destroyers and Frigates; by 2021 we should have 21, by 2022 we have 22, by 2023 we have 23, etc. We also must decommission the type 23 frigates at the current rate, it will not do to keep them going for longer than we need, when the Type 26s are coming along nicely. If strategic partbers can be found for the Type 23 fleet, it would be a substabtial advantage. New Zealand has already placed an order for the Type 26, and the UK should add to it by bringing its own order up from eight to twelve. * We simply cannot put the carriers under the pressure they are currently under; as a lack of surface escorts attracts asymmetric threats, and requires each ship to use more of its total available munitions on deployment. This National Shipbuilding Policy will be set in stone until 2030, at which point we should have a fleet of 30 Destroyers and frigates. In this time, we should also begin to be building the Type 45 II more Destroyers. #30by2030. * RN organisation. Our six destroyers and 13 frigates could be divided into six squadrons of three, leaving one ship free, and the fleet will expand to include at least #30by2030.The thirty frigates can be used in six DEFRIGRON squadrons or flotillas, which will help the RN respond to global needs. One DESFRIGRON should be attached to HMS QE, one to HMS PoW, and then the other four can cycle between a) long layup (6-9 months of refit and extended leave), b) long deployment (6-9 months of stationing in the Caribbean, South Atlantic, Mediterranean, Horn of Africa, Gulf of Guinea, or elsewhere, c) Escorting the Marines, and going on operations with them to escort the LPD and landing fleet, as well as carry helicopter-borne Marines from each of the escorts, d) domestic waters defense, ASW and escorting duties, and other needs that arise, or simply doing operations involving training and testing. These six DESFRIGRONs will allow us to be the global force we need to be. Rather than a tight operaional unit, this administrative designation will allow operational freedom. For instance, if 3-6 ships embark on long deployment at once, we can satisfy several needs at once, and by the time the squadrons consist of five or six ships, our reach and operationalability will be greatly enhanced. * Trident successor subs is good, construction underway, first due in two years * Astute class is outstanding, possibly the best attack submarine at sea in the world. It is necessary for us to consider the need for more submarines, a batch II beginning after the completion of the Dreadnought class, is important. ###RAF * F35b fleet is now 24 for the RAF, and new pilot training is underway. A fleet of 48 for the RN leaves the RAF with 90 planes, for four short squadrons. This will not be sufficient to meet all of our needs when the time for the Tornado Fleet to be decommissioned comes. The RAF should bid for a total of eight squadrons of 24, or 192 F35b * Typhoon performing well, no plans to change * Bomber refuellers going well * Transport doing well * UK lacks a long range bomber, but the emergence of UCAVs is rearranging the need-meet spectrum. In particular the BAE Taranis would provide a good fit for a capability gap in the RAF. Exploration following final designs is necessary. ###Marines, and Special Forces * The catastrophe of the covert operation resulting in the destruction of the dam in Syria has embarressed and stunned the intelligence and special forces community, and the world. We cannot at this time conscion a funding or equipment boost for the SAS, it is best for the country if they are not used for black ops unless as part of outright combat conflict. * Britain needs at least two new LPH/LHD as a matter of urgency. We must be able to land heavy armour rapidly, or our other reforms are for nought  simply building a high-stake standoff, with no ability to follow through to secure ground deployment. A full Airborne Assault Battalion of 500 Infantry and 30 helicopters, is the requirement. This also is part of the #30by2030 fleet escort expansion, which will see a significant increase in the total quantity of surface escorts over the next ten years. The rebuffing of our attempted purchase of new Mistral Assault Ships from France was a further embarressment, and the gap in capability must be plugged by domestic shipbuilding. An enquiry by the Aircraft Carrier Alliance must see us begin to build these vessels by 2025. * CB-90s have been a roaring success, very popular with Marines. We should aim for a lander fleet of around 60 of these boats."
18,cyber crime,GlobalPowers,[EVENT] Sweden investigates a cashless economy,3,63l1gs,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/63l1gs/event_sweden_investigates_a_cashless_economy/,2017-04-05 21:52:38,"Swedish society has rapidly adopted card and mobile payments, especially new contactless readers, leading to a great reduction in the usage of banknotes and coins. Only 20% of transactions in shops use cash, the Swish money transfer app developed by several major banks has been adopted by half of the population. The Swedish iZettle payment system has allowed SMEs and street traders to reap the benefits too. As seen with large denomination currency such as the 500 note, physical money is often used by criminal and terrorist organisations as it is hard to trace and control. Under a fully digital system the location and transaction history of each Krona could be stored, making money laundering far more difficult. To stop abuse of this system there would have to regulations put in place requiring a warrant before intelligence services or law enforcement could access this data. Great effort is expended when designing banknotes and coins; they must be made hard to counterfeit and durable so they do not get damaged and have to be withdrawn. These features include polymer materials, holograms, RFID chips, microprinting and clear windows. The e-Krona would have none of these issues, as it would be almost impossible to forge with records of production being held by the Riksbank. Additionally, banks and shops would hold no money on site making cash robberies a thing of the past. The Riksbank has implemented negative interest rates several times. In a cashless economy, most money would be stored in bank accounts, helping to enforce the effect of negative interest rates. There would be no physical cash to undermine the central bank's efforts. The less-cash society has had negative effects on certain sectors of the population. People living in rural areas and the sparsely populated north have suffered from a lack of cash machines and banks willing to accept cash withdrawals and deposits. The elderly have also struggled with maintaining their use of cash while most of Sweden has transitioned away from it, doing away with the old infrastructure. A fully cashless society would do away with the issues that people who keep using cash have, but also make it even harder for some to cope with. There are of course major hurdles that must be overcome before making a decision to scrap cash. There are civil liberties issues, as every single transaction would have some kind of record there would be potential for abuse by governments, businesses or financial institutions. It could take away significant freedoms and give too much power to certain organisations. There is a perceived risk from cyber crime, terrorism and state cyber attacks, however, given the low circulation rate of the physical Krona there would be little extra impact. The average Swede would have the vast majority of their savings stored in the bank anyway. The Sveriges Riksbank has been tasked with investigating the potential benefits and risks of the e-Krona, and devising further details for the mechanisms that would be put into place. As the first country that would implement a cashless economy, they have many decisions to make about technologies such as blockchain, encryption and anonymity. Should we decide to move ahead with the plans, the change would come some time in the late 2020s."

Mission: To protect India from threats originating in cyber world by determining threats and contentious monitoring the threats and swiftly eliminating them when they pose threat to the nation. Vision: To be top anti-hacking group in the world by following highest standards of cyber security with a zero tolerance policy for the crime. The ministry of defense has secretly created this group existence of which is known by few in the government. Only the president, prime minister, home minister , minister of defense, director of R&amp;AW are aware of existence of the group. This group will be coordinating with known Indian hackers in identifying threats from cyber world. This group will also have special access to all encrypted transmission passing through Indian networks and will have decryption ability. This group will monitor web sites, web forums, social networks sites, video sites, code sharing sites, mobile communication, vpns, IRCs, video or audio calls in and out of country, emails and text messages. This group will have complete control contents. This group will be using specially developed sophisticated software that will automatically scan for words and phrases that will be flagged if the software find a certain level of threat. The software has been developed by Indian company Infosys and is found to be having more then 94% success rate in flagging suspicious conversation. Once a threat has been identified a dedicated sub group of elite white hat hackers will be assigned to evaluate threat. Once the threat has been evaluated, it will be assigned code. From code to code blue. The identified threats will be continuously monitored for activity. This monitoring will be done by both human and software to compliment each other. Once it is determined that the threat is moving against national interest, there will be massive attack to cripple the infrastructure that the threat is using, in turn disabling threat. Right now the only role of NAG is for defense and deter the cyber threats. However based in future events this could be changed to offense anytime. "

Taking reports from independent bodies, military departments, international partners, and chied MoD personnel, the report is wide ranging, and will form the spine of govenrment defense policy for the life of the parliament. it is not set in stone, and government may decline to follow all its recommendations. ###Military Forces ####Sea The Royal Navy is fast becoming the most ideal gem in the Crown. The fleet is growing annually with powerful and versatile shipping being manufactured in this country. The shipping is sustained by international orders for our craft, which has brought about five shipbuilding sites making expansions in the last ten years: Barrow, Govan, Scotstoun, Devonport, and lately Belfast. This has served to ensure that British jobs in heavy industry have grown, and turned profits, where before they seemed in terminal decline. The fleet: #####2025 * 2 QE Class CVA * 2 Celtic Class LHD * 6 Type 45 Destroyer * 8 Type 26 Global Combat Frigates * 8 Type 26b Fleet Frigates * 2 Albion Class LPD * 4 Vanguard Class SSBN * 7 Astute Class SSN All these ships in regular service means the fleet is larger than at any point since the Gulf War, and is set to grow larger. When all the ships cirrently on order are completed, the fleet will comprise: * 2 QE Class CVA * 2 Celtic Class LPD * 4 Type 61 Cruisers * 9 Type 45 Destroyers * 8 Type 26 GCF * 8 Type 26b FF * 4 Capital Class SSBN * 7 Astute Class SSN This will be in 2032, as things stand. This gives us a large Air Platform-to-Escort ratio, and an imminent challenge of reforming the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. Reccommendations: 1. A second Destroyer run of three Type 45s follows the completion of the current order *if the current order is met on time and within budget* 2. A new run of seven Type 26b Fleet Frigates begins as soon as practicable, bringing the total up to 15. Possibly following the highly successful strategy of using civilian shipbuilders to build hulls, then BAE to fit it out. Swan Hunter in Newcastle would be the only British group able to handle this amount of output at present. 3. A run of four Type 26 Global Combat Frigates to begin when capacity will allow, bringing the total up to 12. The Type 26 is justly becoming the go-to ship for sending alone on deploymebts to overseas territories. 4. A run of five new Astute Class SSN to begin following the order completed for the Italian Navy, bringing our total up to 12. Their highly successful deployment has been invaluable, and our ability to use them to secure our own waters, as well as send task groups into blue water, is essential. 5. An overhaul of the Royal Fleet auxiliary. The LPH, Point class ro-ros and several other ships are aged and suffer from limited capability. At least one more Celtic Class LHD, four replacement ro-ro transports, an icebreaker, hospital ship, and up to four more Tide Class Replenishment ships, should be considered. * We need a new Anti Sunmarine missile able to be launched from a VLS tube - our Sharknado torpedoes are the best in the world, but with a vertical launch missile, we are able to strike submarine targets with greater force, and range. ####Air * The F3 and F3B STOVL air superiority fighter is being constructed in the country, at a new facility in the Northeast, and Britiah companies BAE and Rolls Royce have worked with Japanese counterparts to produce a jet fighter which can perform air superiority, dogfighting, and escort tasks better than any other aircraft in the sky. The Joint Fighter is well placed to support our needs until the purported 6th gen fighters offer new challenges. * We should purchase up to 138 more F35a and F35b aircraft, to afford our growing jet and carrier fleets enough opportunity to replace the Tornado craft passing outof use, and allow the Royal Marines to feasibly have an air arm able to operate from their Celtic Class LHDs. * A long range bomber able to deliver highly precise munitions to specific targets from high altitude is essential. The BAE Taranis should be ready by 2030, and a fleet of around 60 would allow us to strike anywhere on the globe quickly, without having to use Intercontinental missiles or deploy a carrier strike group. * Smler UCAV options must be explored and exploited, the capability means pilot deaths on routine surveillance missions cannot be considered an appropriate risk. We must expand our UAV and UCAV fleet to offer ua more coastal and battlefield surveillance. * Our helicopter fleet is adequate for our needs. ####Land * A new generation Main Battle Tank is being explored with at least one other international partner. This suits our Challenger 2 fleet's approaching deadline for expiration of their LEP, and our need for a British built tank to challenge the status quo offered by the German, US, Russian, and Chinese platforms. * Our amphibious vehicle fleet needs replacing, and compatibility with the Royal Marines new ships is essential. * An unmanned Fighting Vehicle has proved conceptual validity, and should be explored as part of a wider inquiry into unmanned land vehicles such as minesweepers, SAM batteries, and Reconnaisance vehicles. * The Ajax and Ratchet vehicles have been superbly integrated into our new fighting structure, and replacement of other aging platforms may be necessary before the next SDSR. ###Other Security Forces ####Cyber Warfare * GCHQ remains our only central intelligence database, and needs expansion. An increase of budget and staff alone will not equip us to face the challenges posed by cyber attack. * Our military encryption facilities remain adequate for our needs, and is relentlessly pursuing proven goals and adaptations to ensure operablity and clandestine signal output. * All MoD computers should switch to a linux platform - as a cost saver, to take advantage of new user friendly operating features, and as a security measure. ####International and Organised Crime * New treaties in NATO, the EU, and the UN must equip British law enforcement peraonnel to prosecute perpetrators of crimes that harm britain and britons more fully. ####Space * The development of Skylon is relatively imminent, and its significance for security and defense must be explored. It must be to our advantage to have craft capable of such rapid transit, and it must be in our interests to keep 3rd parties from obtaining it."
