CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. Its database records, known as CVEs, track and record publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each recorded vulnerability has a unique ID and lifecycle where it follows certain states. # The AsicBoost controversy In April 2017, Greg Maxwell published an email [2] on the bitcoin-dev mailing list which described AsicBoost - a patented optimization to the algorithm used in Bitcoin mining - as an attack on the Bitcoin protocol. There was much contention [3] about whether AsicBoost constituted some kind of harmful exploit, or whether it was merely a technological innovation which enabled more efficient mining hardware (ASICs). There were allegations, widely reported in media, that the patent served the interest of Bitmain [4]. The purported benefits of exploiting this patent as alleged by Core developers were contemporaneously disputed by other miners [5]. # CVE-2017-9230 raised against AsicBoost On 18 May 2017, Cameron Garnham posted to the bitcoin-dev list [6], urging for getting a CVE assigned to the perceived vulnerability. On 24 May 2017, this CVE was created as CVE-2017-9230 [7]. It was simultaneously published under Bugtraq ID 'BID 98657' at [8]. The justification in the CVE stated that the AsicBoost method &gt; 'violates the security assumptions of (1) the choice of input, outside &gt; of the dedicated nonce area, fed into the Proof-of-Work function should &gt; not change its difficulty to evaluate and (2) every Proof-of-Work &gt; function execution should be independent.' It seemed a plausible enough reasoning for the CVE to be assigned. It was entered in the list of Bitcoin-related CVE's at [9]. Detailed information on this particular CVE is still missing/incomplete on the wiki page, a year after the CVE was raised. # What happened since the CVE was raised If you've followed along, you've learned that the CVE was raised to counter the exploitation of the AsicBoost method by miners. Since then, however, a Core developer, BtcDrak, has been involved in the founding of a mining company, Halong Mining. Several online sources state his (part?) ownership of this company. BtcDrak has put forward a proposal [10] which would enable the use of AsicBoost within the Bitcoin Core software (the dominant client software on the BTC network). This proposal appears to directly contradict the CVE claims of how AsicBoost violates ""security assumptions"" of Bitcoin, and indeed does not address how it mitigates them, nor is CVE-2017-9230 referenced in any of its related documentation. While the proposal's specification [11] and implementation [12] have not yet been formally accepted, the situation is that Halong has shipped mining equipment which is now actively employing AsicBoost [13,14] on the Bitcoin (BTC) network. There is even a website showing the blocks where AsicBoost was used [15]. # Conflict of interest There a clear conflict of interest in the actions of the Core developer BtcDrak. His actions as a Core developer appear to be furthering his company's interests and competitive advantage in the mining industry by exploiting a vulnerability of which he must have been keenly aware, having participated on the same bitcoin-dev mailing list where it was discussed. The CVE was vociferously used to paint Bitmain as culpable for delaying Segwit (Bitmain was accused of using AsicBoost and blocking Segwit activation for their own profit motive - claims that Bitmain has publicly denied strongly and which were never substantiated). One might have expected a similar outcry against Halong's *proven* and *announced* use of AsicBoost, but the parties that had previously condemned Bitmain remained mostly silent. Only an anonymous non-developer, Cobra-Bitcoin, co-owner of the bitcoin.org domain, spoke out on the Github pull request in [11], and Core developer Luke-jr spoke out against the use of the proposal on the Bitcoin network while consensus had not been reached on it [16]. Subsequent discussion on the bitcoin-dev list on this topic since March has been minimal and only concerned with technicalities of stratum protocol changes. # The bigger elephant in the room It seems logical that either AsicBoost constitutes an exploitable weakness, and thus merits a CVE and measures taken to prevent its use on the Bitcoin network entirely. Or it is not a problem and the CVE should be invalidated. The Bitcoin Core project should use its consensus processes to arrive at a coherent decision. # Other problems raised by the use of overt AsicBoost The Halong implementation uses version rolling of the `nversion` bits of the header. It reserves a subset of those bits for overt AsicBoost. These bits are no longer available to BIP9, but there was no update of BIP9 proposed to address this impact. This is a question of sensible procedures being followed (or not). The author did not find any review comment mentioning the lack of BIP9 specification update, which suggest a lack of thorough review on a proposal which dates back several months. A minor issue is that the Core implementation warns when a certain proportion of unrecognized version bits are detected. This behavior can be triggered by the AsicBoost method used on the network. --- [1] URL [2] URL [3] URL [4] URL [5] URL [6] URL [7] URL [8] URL [9] URL [10] URL [11] URL [12] URL [13] URL [14] URL [15] URL [16] URL --- EDITS: 1. make dates unambiguous, make it clear that [5] disputes the benefits alleged by Core developers"
