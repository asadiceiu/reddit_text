The actual impact of such attempts on the result itself would be difficult  if not impossible  to prove. However what is clear is that the government was slow to recognise the existence of the threat  only understanding it after the hack and leak operation against the Democratic National Committee, when it should have been seen as early as 2014. As a result the government did not take action to protect the UKs process in 2016. The committee has not been provided with any post-referendum assessment - in stark contrast to the US response to reports of interference in the 2016 presidential election. In our view there must be an analogous assessment of Russian interference in the EU referendum. - &gt; We therefore question whether the Government took its eye off the ball because of its focus on counter-terrorism: it was the opinion of the Committee that until recently the Government had badly underestimated the response required to the Russian threat -and is still playing catch up. The Committee oversees the intelligence and security activities of the UK, including the policies, expenditure, administration and operations of MI5, MI6 and the Government Communications Headquarters. The Committee makes an Annual Report on the discharge of its functions and also produces Reports on specific issues. The Committee receives highly classified evidence, much of which cannot be published without damaging the operational capabilities of the intelligence Agencies. There is therefore a lengthy process to prepare the Committee's reports ready for publication, which consists of four stages and takes around four months. The Committee's report on Russia was sent to the Prime Minister on 17 October 2019. - &gt; The Committee has not been provided with any post-referendum assessment - in stark contrast to the US response to reports of interference in the 2016 presidential election. In our view there must be an analogous assessment of Russian interference in the EU referendum. - &gt; It has previously been agreed that the Prime Minister would have ten working days in which to provide this confirmation, before the Report is laid before Parliament. The Committees report on Russia was sent to the Prime Minister on 17 October 2019. - &gt; There has been credible open source commentary suggesting that Russia undertook influence campaigns in relation to the Scottish independence referendum in 2014. However, at the time \*\*\*. It appears that \*\*\* what some commentators have described as potentially the first post-Soviet Russian interference in a Western democratic process. We note that  almost five years on  \*\*\* For example, it was widely reported shortly after the referendum that Russian election observers had suggested that there were irregularities in the conduct of the vote, and this position was widely pushed by Russian state media. We understand that HMG viewed this as being primarily aimed at discrediting the UK in the eyes of a domestic Russian audience. More recently, we note the study by Ben Nimmo  #ElectionWatch: Scottish Vote, Pro-Kremlin Trolls, 12 December 2017. - &gt; We note that Arron Banks became the biggest donor in British political history when he gave 8m to the Leave.EU campaign. In October 2018, the Electoral Commission  which had been investigating the source of this donation  referred the case to the National Crime Agency, which investigated it \*\*\*. In September 2019, the National Crime Agency announced that it had concluded the investigation, having found no evidence that any criminal offences had been committed under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 or company law by any of the individuals or organisations referred to it by the Electoral Commission. 51 *** - &gt; (From the Guardian): Kevan Jones says the government has spent the past week trying to discredit the report, implying its conclusions are out of date. They are not, he says. And he repeats his point about how the reasons being given by No 10 for the report being delayed are just not true. He says he has been saddened by this. The ISC does a serious job, he says. It is an important part of democracy. The way it has been treated by the government does not help, he says. Stewart Hosie says any lessons that could have been learnt will now be learnt later, perhaps too late to stop future cyber attacks. He says the system for protecting the UK from cyber attacks is too complicated. - &gt; (From the Government): We have seen no evidence of successful interference in the EU referendum. The intelligence and security agencies produce and contribute to regular assessments of the threat posed by hostile state activity, including around potential interference in UK democratic processes. We keep such assessments under review and, where necessary, update them in response to new intelligence, including during democratic events such as elections and referendums. Where new information emerges, the government will always consider the most appropriate use of any intelligence it develops or receives, including whether it is appropriate to make this public. Given this long standing approach, a retrospective assessment of the EU Referendum is not necessary. --- If there's any additional information that should be included here, feel free to PM me."
1,cyber crime,unitedkingdom,I'd like to discuss cyber-bullying and my proposals for combating it.,0,90ig74,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/90ig74/id_like_to_discuss_cyberbullying_and_my_proposals/,2018-07-21 04:25:15,"It's a long one. Go to paragraph 3 if you want to cut to the chase, what comes before is context. I've put this up on because it chimes in with my thoughts on how UK law could be amended in order to combat a very destructive threat to the safety and well-being of vulnerable individuals. I feel I should share some context of my situation to help you understand and to find out if anyone here can relate. I believe I personally have been a victim of cyberbully, most likely on Snapchat which as a platform has notoriety as a breeding ground for cyber-bullies who can cover there tracks with ease due to how the app is operated. People have been driven to suicide because of Snapchat bullying. I have decided to contact the police in my local area to open up an investigation into whether this kind of malicious activity has been done against me. I'm not here to discuss the details how I have deduced this is likely what has happened but rest assured it is to be considered seriously based on the evidence that exists. It is either that I have been impersonated (Identity theft?) or have been externally targeted by an account or accounts on social media. There is no sign of such activity on Facebook, Reddit or other mainstream platforms I use. If cyber-bullying has occurred it'll probably be on a messaging app which I do not use and do not wish to start using for reasons I'll go in to now. It is my belief that the way messaging apps are structured and organised in their current form is dangerous and put vulnerable people at risk of being victims of large networks of bullies who act with relative impunity due to the difficulty of accessing information on profiles to determine if they are fake or malicious. I believe that Snapchat, Tinder and other such apps should have to follow a strict set of guideline before they are allowed to operate in this country. Call it controversial, call it harsh, call it a threat to 'free speech' if you will but I'll think you a short-sighted fool especially if you hurl the latter at me. I care about people not having their reputations and sense of self annihilated by online lynch mobs. We need to ensure the well-being of individuals and protect or give them the means to protect their own dignity. I've said already and I'll say again, people are dead because of the damage bullying through these apps have done and others have experiences crisis in mental health, social relationships , jobs, security and threats to personal safety including the threat of physical harm or death. These social media platforms and all that would replace them need to be held to higher standards. (Paragraph 3) I'm going to focus on Snapchat as my target example. If you wish to report a grievance on Snapchat, communication with customer services or the technical department is not straight forward. You can push a report button and then it seems that it's up to them to get back in touch with you or you have to settle for the Snapchat support website which in my view seems to want to avoid actual talking or engaging in direct communication with the concerned party. You basically do a little quiz about your grievance and a short passage of text or a deferral to a verbose wall of text. And so, my first suggested law change is: That Snapchat be legally required to see up a fully fledged customer services framework at the very least for the purpose of reporting unacceptable content which would have a phone-line and an email address accessible at most times. They should also be expected to set up an investigative body within the company to gather evidence on malicious accounts and submit that to the police. Short of this and the police have to do it themselves and after being told of a 50 minute waiting queue on the non-emergency 101 number I think Snapchat should take on some of the investigative work themselves. If they are negligent then it's not fair others should face the consequences or clean up the mess. If you're that sloppy you shouldn't be in the business. Failure to follow such guidelines as these should mean Snapchat cannot be allowed to operate in the UK and someone who can follow them can take their place. You can't have nice things if you use them for ugly purposes. Now I'm quite a liberal guy but I've drawn the line here. My second proposal is: For Snapchat and other messaging apps such as Tinder, to be required to compile databases of all user profiles to allow concerned parties or law enforcement to identify malicious accounts and activities. These database, for the sake of greater privacy of the apps users, could be accessed only on request and for a limited time with limited coverage but must also be accessible within a reasonable time-frame to allow investigations to proceed quickly. Also messaging apps must be discreet when investigating malicious users and lock their accounts the moment evidence is found in the interests of legal cases. Lastly, I've a proposal for changes the legal code itself too: The following idea I've had concerns how the law in the UK defines cyber-bullying offences. If it is true that my identity has been stolen and I have been impersonated online maliciously regardless of financial motive, is it not still identity theft? Thing is, based on my research on the matter, the law is not clear that the term *identity theft* includes the practice of adopting the identity of another in order to bully that person rather than commit crime, usually of a financial nature (Identity fraud). Current legal definitions it seems, define identity theft precedes identity fraud and do not address stealing someones image and name for the sake of mere malice. Is that a hole in the law? If so it should be plugged. If my concern does turn out to be true, I've had something of mine stolen for purposes that I do not approve of. The culprits can reasonably be described as thieves and should be treated in a similar fashion. Thank you for reading this, I hope I've given some food for thought on this matter and would like to discuss this more with anyone here who is interested or has had a similar experience with cyberbullies. Also if there is anyone here who knows more on the law concerning this issue please expand on what I've put and contribute to the discussion. Are there any organisations that are campaigning for law changes like these I've proposed? I'd like to find out more about them. The floor is open. TL;DR: Getting cyber-bullied, cyber-bullying is national issue, People's lives are getting destroyed, Messenger Apps are not doing enough to combat this, Change should be force upon them to bring their practices up to standard and keep people, both users and non-users, safe from malicious activity. Investigating suspected cyber-bulling should be made straight forward with a proactive engagement from app operators with useful resources available to private investigators and law enforcement. Proposed changes to legal definitions that define cyberbullies that impersonate their victims as the identity thieves that they are. "
2,cyber crime,unitedkingdom,UK'rs here. Do you care about end to end encryption being circumvented by the Government?,106,2ss0m6,http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2ss0m6/ukrs_here_do_you_care_about_end_to_end_encryption/,2015-01-18 10:09:24,"I work in technology, actually I work for one of the very, very large bank that recently got hacked. I can't elaborate obviously. But I see this end to end encryption thing as a bloody nightmare. David Cameron has suggested a backdoor in it, or scrapping it entirely. My two biggest concerns are: - If a backdoor is put in, for law enforcement. Then I can get in too. That's how it works. If I can get in, other people can get in. Other people will fuck your day up. - If end to end encryption is circumvented or outlawed. The very fundamental fabric of our electronic businesses are doomed. Absolutely, completely and utterly doomed. I don't want to get all apocalyptic. But the implications are enormous, we as a nation are already in a bit of shit with cyber crime. This is just the tip of the ice berg if this goes ahead. So what do we do? Is there a petition? Do you all care? If you don't you should! You should be caring a lot! You should all be writing to your MPs and complaining that this is some serious end time stuff if it goes ahead. It really is awful and I cannot stress that enough from a technological perspective"
