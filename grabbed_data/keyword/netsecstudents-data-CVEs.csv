Back at black hat 2010 Thinkst presented their research on this topic ( URL and I have been using it as my primary reference point. However it has not been updated since then and only includes events before 2010. What particular events over the past 10 years do you think played a role in the evolution of memory corruption defenses? I am talking about things like new attack techniques, significant cves (e.g. eternal blue), the launch of new mitigations e.g CFG etc."
1,CVEs,netsecstudents,First (internship) pentest Monday.,1,en1vcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/netsecstudents/comments/en1vcg/first_internship_pentest_monday/,2020-01-11 14:06:31,"Hey r/netsecstudents, so I started an internship at a smaller company late last year. They've been great teaching me a lot more about the professional IT world and I've learned a lot in my short time working for them. What's great is that I let them know my interest in security/pentesting and they've been super supportive. So to make a long story short I've been assigned my first (small) pentest, and I've been wondering where to really start. The application sign-in page is SSO so I was thinking maybe a timing attack to determine vaild user credentials. And beyond that just trying some older exploits like SQL Injections, XXS, and finding the version of the webserver hosting the page and checking for any CVEs related to it. &amp;#x200B; Does this sound ok?? Is there anything glaringly obvious I'm missing? How did your first test go? Thank you you guys, I'm really happy about getting a shot to get some hands-on experience but I'm nervous about messing it up. Any advice would be appreciated :)"

(not only cves or known frameworks vulnerabilities where you just msf your way out). Any review on pentesterlab / virtual hacking labs / anything similar is appreciated
3,CVEs,netsecstudents,Wrapping up my first real penetration testing gig as an independent consultant. How did I do? Any holes in my approach?,20,7169p7,https://www.reddit.com/r/netsecstudents/comments/7169p7/wrapping_up_my_first_real_penetration_testing_gig/,2017-09-20 07:25:20,"I should say that this sub has been a great resource for me as I've transitioned into the world of security. I've been doing full stack web application development for the past few years as a consultant and have recently been reading a bunch of books on network and application security. I managed to pitch a potential web dev client on letting me do a security assessment of their current web stack before coming on, but I wanted to see if there were any holes in my work. The client gave me a list of a few dozen different domains they own (lots of targeted lead generation websites, collecting information from users who are interested in offers for different industries) and told me they really wanted me to focus on their more recent websites that was all hosted on one particular server. I asked if they were concerned about someone accessing their database of the submitted personal information (mostly name, email, zip, gender) but they said they were more focused on how resilient the sites were and how well they'd stay online and resist attacks. Here's what I've done so far: 1. Resolved all of the domains to confirm which ones pointed at the correct server they wanted tested (some domains were parked so I could ignore those) 2. Did an `nmap` scan doing OS detection/banner grabbing and scanning all possible ports (1-65535). The only ones that were open were 80 and 443 (good for client, bad for me). Seemed like there wasn't much of an attack surface at the network layer. 3. From HTTP ""Server"" header, I saw they were running apache 2.4.10 which [has a list of known vulnerabilities](URL None looked too promising, but I'm going to play around with a few of the CVEs in metasplot later. 4. Looking through the HTML response of their web page, I saw most of the sites were running WordPress as the CMS. I ran a quick version detection script and saw that all the sites were running 4.1.17. Did a `wpscan` on a few of the domains and they all seemed to have similar output. A few missing security headers and a potential stored XXS for getting user's sessions, but the site doesn't use logins and the client said that social engineering any of their employees was out of scope, so it didn't seem like there was much I could use to get privileged access to the site. 5. I ran a `nikto` scan against a few of the domains, hoping there might be an exposed phpMyAdmin or something, but again, not much besides a few missing security headers. 6. I found that their wordpress login page used HTTP Basic Auth (browser displayed a pop-up asking for username and password). I grabbed the list of the [top 1MM passwords](URL and started firing those off with the default ""admin"" user. Burp Intruder was pretty slow so I wrote a python script that used threads to do it myself in a few hours. Nothing matched :/ The last thing on my list where I might actually score a win is launching a DoS attack (during an approved time window) to see if I can overwhelm the site with traffic and take it offline. Other than that, I'm not sure that I'll really be able to present any substantial vulnerability findings, which I'm pretty bummed about. Are there any other leads you think I could chase? At a higher level, does this sound like stuff a script kiddie would be capable of or is this in the realm of an actual, professional security audit? Thanks for any and all feedback!"

So my question to you guys is: what do you consider essential CVEs to be familiar with when pen testing? Which exploits do you come across time and time again? I'd like to compile a list, and work my way through them if possible. Thanks in advance."

I'm already monitoring CVEs &amp; the SANS StormCenter RSS feeds, but I'm pretty confident that there have to be other good resources as well. Much thanks in advance!!"

I've done Masters level courses at a well respected university about the history of computer security, written a master's thesis about a specific type of hacking and researched in that field. I've also done practical things like bug bounties, CTFs, using metasploit and tools etc. But all of this is just learning to use the tools, or copying others did such attacks. None of it is actually teaching one how to find new/undiscovered vulnerabilities in apps/OSes that could be used for illegitimate means, thus created into worthwhile CVEs. I would very much like to fuzz, reverse engineer, etc. To be able to find more practical issues. Could anyone please give some advice?"

I've checked the CVSS scores of CVEs and it does not have an attribute specifically stating it's a RCE vulnerability. Also it's possible to check in the CVE description for keywords, but sometimes it's quite similar (remote command execution, etc) here is example of 2 similar CVEs for that matter: URL URL "
