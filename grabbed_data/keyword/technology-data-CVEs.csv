I'm Derek from the Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, and we have completed an audit of OpenVPN 2.4.0 with QuarksLab. You can view the synopsis of the results here, and the full report is also linked within: URL The audit resulted in two CVEs URL URL As well as a number of minor issues and fixes. I will be checking this post and answering any questions you might have about the organization, our goals, or this audit for the rest of the day today. After that I will still periodically check this post for updated questions or comments. Thank you to the 33 companies and hundreds of people that supported this effort. This happened because the community made it happen. Our next target is OpenSSL 1.1.1 which is the first version to implement TLS 1.3. The update contains a lot of code changes that give us an opportunity to review and improve the code to make it safer. The biggest way that you can contribute to us is by word of mouth. The more people hear about the positive work that we do, the more likely we are going to get donations, business contacts, and the logistical support that we need to operate and grow. We have many ways to contribute to our cause, some of them being completely cost-free. Check out our donations page to see how to help! "
1,CVEs,technology,Imgur is doing something fishy with 4chan screencaps,110,3lw742,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3lw742/imgur_is_doing_something_fishy_with_4chan/,2015-09-22 13:37:04,"URL /u/vinster271 writes &gt;When an Imgur image is loaded from /r/4chan, imgur loads a bunch of images from 4chan's content delivery network or 8chan (unclear at this point, might be both), which causes a DDoS to those sites. See this picture: URL You should only see one image loaded in that list, not all of those. (This what a normal Imgur image looks like when it is loaded URL See that only the one image is loaded, not 500 random ones. The injected.js is just a chrome extension.) Basically, clicking on a Imgur link on /r/4chan ends up opening ~500 links from 4chan.org/8chan. and /u/EnemyScoot provides an alternate explanation &gt;What the fuuuuuck First the shady 2ch owner taking over 4chan and now this? What is happening EDIT: HOW TO FIX FROM NAMEFAG SKDL: &gt;Here is my write-up on the compromises: &gt;URL &gt;tl;dr Exploits XSS on 8 ch via Flash and probably a domain misconfiguration/oversight on 8 ch (SWFs can be uploaded by users + static content can be accessed through the ""media."" subdomain as well as the root domain). XSS places a persistent beacon on all 8 ch pages to wait for further JS to run, as issued by a server, though the new JS is yet to be sent. XSS is spreading to likely users of 8 ch by compromising imgur through unknown means. No DDoS, no attempt to exploit recent Flash CVEs (yet). Flash is only used for XSS purposes here. &gt;Mitigation: &gt;Visit any 8 ch board and type localStorage.favorites in dev console. If you see a string containing a bunch of \u0055 type numbers, then you fell victim to the XSS. Simply type localStorage.favorites = """" and refresh the page, and you're safe, as long as you don't load the compromised Flash again. Don't visit imgur in the near future, and install a Flash blocker like Flashcontrol, or a more robust blocker like NoScript or uMatrix. TL;DR: Imgur is either deliberately or inadvertently DDOSing 8ch.net by opening several 8ch.net links with each screencap opening. Imgur has most likely been compromised through some sort of exploit by an outsider. "
