I love that about you. Hello fellow weirdos, nerds, unicorns, and magicians! I am looking for my partner in crime to enjoy what the world has to offer together. Maybe fate was destined and you are intrigued and want to get to know me. I am laid back, easy going, and enjoy to live in the moment. A label I like to put on myself is ""introverted extrovert"". I have strong emotions and wear my heart on my sleeve. My head is a walking idea generator. I'm constantly buzzing with crazy ideas, daydreams, visions and concepts so much that I get easily distracted. I am happily optimistic and keep blabbering about how I experience mundane stuff. I love listening to you rambling about whatever, as long as you are enthusiasticly talking. I consider myself very open minded. I like to discuss politics, sciences, philosophy, religion, psychology and interpersonal relationships. I don't really like to put humans into boxes, escpecially msyelf. No matter what box you try to put me in, I'll claw my way out. I value authenticity above all else. I love music of all different kinds, from death metal to psytrance, from hip hop to 80ies. I love progressive and psychedelic rock the most. I love concersts and festivals. I love psychedelic art, op art, and everything with ""heavy"" imagery. In my free time I like to write as a hobby - poems,short stories, and recently philosophical texts. I love horror, fantasy and scifi. I am a huge nerd. That obscure cyber punk novel? I read it. That avant garde horror movie? seen it. David Lynch, Tarantino, and Nolan are my favourites. I love cartoons and anime as well. Adventure time, Bojack Horseman, Rick and Morty. Steins;gate, FMA Brotherhood, Jojo's bizarre adventure and One Piece. I love PC gaming. At least once or twice a week I play Counter Strike, DotA, or chess with my online friends. I enjoy single player games as well. Everytime I get sucked into a world and can't do anything in my free time than to finish that game. Witcher, Mass Effect, Red Dead Redemption 2, Bio Shock and all that good stuff. Currently playing Sekiro while waiting for Cyberpunk. However I don't game that often! I love meeting with friends. I meetup with most of them at a bar at least twice a month. I enjoy meeting up for board games, a few drinks, listening to music and talk shit. &amp;#x200B; What I like in women: \-be engaging and passionate \-be intelligent and knowledgeable \-emotional needy, even clingy. \-show me you like me. Seriously, stalk me. \-bonus if you are introverted/depressed .... \-looks are optional \-&gt; I like chubby girls with long hair &amp;#x200B; Red Flags: \-have as many as you like \-I like to collect too &amp;#x200B; Still reading? Message me immediately then."

I work as a Systems Analyst for a Large Medical Practice and I am currently 2 years away from my B.S in Cyber Security. My job is stressful and I am on salary but I really do like everyone, even my bosses which is rare. I have a son but he is gonna be 18 in another year and decided to move with his mom, and I now have a condo on the beach to myself which is awesome. He visits but has his GF's and buddies, so he has a life and is working on college. Good stuff, to be honest, I do not do a whole lot anymore with school and work. I workout at home in the spare bedroom which is now my...well, workout area. I listen to a lot of podcasts, I am studying French and Russian with a plan to go by myself to Paris next year. I am also heading to Orlando in October for a conference which should be fun, I am very independent but I lack the skills to meet anyone. Don't get me wrong I like talking to people, but at the moment I tend to be a bit of a homebody. I rarely drink but I smoke a lot of weed (big surprise huh?) and I love animals, cats especially and I wish to own a few servals down the road when I buy a home and have land for them to roam. I am very sweet with my SO when I have one, and I know how to make those little things really special. I have a good heart but I am not very trusting of people. I love tea, and I am a diabetic but take care of myself with meds and insulin injections and I really do watch what I eat. I watch a lot of horror movies. Like a lot, I have a server with a huge library that utilizes plex for all my horror and most of it is 80's and 70's horror which includes TV shows. It's my thing and I love horror conventions. I collect artwork as well and have a rare piece from [Clive Barker] (URL I like true crime documentaries, paranormal and cryptids and enjoy a macabre sense of humor.

I'm a 22 year young guy from the dumpster fire New York, and I'm looking for my partner in cyber crime. If you like dark humor, binge drinking, and watching game shows, look no further, you've found your soul mate. I guess you could say I've lived a pretty awesome life so far, I had the highest batting average of my little league when I was 10, several tae kwon do participation trophies, and an art award from 3rd grade. Try to top that. If you're into tall burly men with beards, tattoos, and poor vision, then you should send me a message. Many would describe me as a gentle giant. So I'm a pretty nice dude, at least that's what my mom tells me. In reality I'm a kind hearted guy, who likes nothing more than just being in the presence of people I like. You could find me at the local pub, on craigslist selling stolen goods, or here on reddit, making a long, descriptive post about myself. My type is super basic. I like people with interesting personalities, and people who are decent. Don't have to be a saint, but don't be a dick yagetwhatimsayin. If my post made you laugh, or struck an emotional cord, drop me a line, I'd love to chat with someone. Hope all you bastards have a good evening, and enjoy the rest of your lives."

The idea of being 30 and alone never seemed too daunting before but its starting to feel like its officially forever and alone. Ive made it this far with no kids and no debt to show...but I realize its partly because Im a workaholic who never puts himself out there. Anyway, a bit about me: I work full time and go to college. Finishing up my associates in criminal justice and hoping to pursue a bachelors in cyber crime or criminology afterwards. Ive lived in 4 different states. Im in Nevada right now, but moving down south in the next 8-10 months. Im into all the cliche stuff like long drives, long walks, concerts, cooking and traveling. I have a big truck because off roading is fun AF. Im a dog person - I have 2 Great Pyrenees and a Border Collie. I love college football, the Food Network, true crime shows, and crappy Lifetime movies but I prefer to be doing anything outdoors. I wanna learn how to fish and have archery as a hobby. Theres almost nothing that I cant get into; my friends say Im hilarious and easy to get along with. The bad part? In addition to my slightly below average looks, Im also 53! I know thats a deciding factor for most women, so I figure I throw it out there and not waste anyones time. Worst case scenario? I seem interesting and you want to be friends!

Im 57 , From Arizona, I am Hispanic. Im also bisexual. Currently struggling with social anxiety and borderline personality disorder. This is not a simple disorder and I know theres a ton of stigma or lack of knowledge but currently on the road to remission. I have ZERO fucking access to mental healthcare so everything Im doing, Im doing on my own. From applying mindfulness, using skills from a DBT workbook, meditation, exercise and helping others out as I help myself. Once upon a time, I managed to eradicate extreme mood swings, paranoia and intense anger (all symptoms of BPD) under one month. I was once a hypochondriac for over a year which almost led me to take my life and in one therapy session, I was relieved from it. I know I have it in me to be better. I enjoy reading. Anything that makes me think and resonates well with me basically. Currently reading a book that applies psychology to Batman and its characters. I enjoy all sorts of books though Im not big on pure romance or western/historical fiction unless versed with fantasy elements. Im a true crime and psychology enthusiast. Torn between becoming a social worker or entering cyber security (even though I dont know shit about cyber security... whaaat). I am a ***HUGE*** film buff. Recently got into screenwriting and currently studying the craft of it. I just got into the horror genre, but Im deeply into movies that are about mental illness, psychological thrillers, Im into comedy movies and crime movies as well. Im looking for someone I can stream shit on rabb.it with. I also have a love for TV. Buffy, Gotham, Jane The Virgin and tons of others. Sons of Anarchy is a series I hold dear to me. Im a massive comic book geek. I just got into comic books and while I prefer DC I do love Marvel as well... just not as much. In terms of sexual chemistry, Im interested in BDSM. Im quite the horn dog, too. Lets not make this the main focal point though. I have PCOS which can make it difficult for me to have children in the future but I wont give up on that either. I guess Im looking for someone I can text consistently throughout the day or voice chat at night . I want someone who is willing to work shit out and not give me some lame excuse (timing is off, etc). Im not a real religious person and Im not much of a drinker/smoker. I want someone with substance, has a sort of direction in life, and preferably 21-26 though I wouldnt mind 27-29 either. I notice I am usually into dorky, lanky white dudes but hey I dont mind. I prefer to keep an open mind. We are all lonely here and for whatever reason many of us struggle finding people outside of the internet or some shit... but I want you to know that... shit sucks now but one day ... it will be our time to be happy. To have someone. Just got to give t time and patience. Im desperately searching for someone I can connect with but well see. I also have to admit Im incredibly shallow and Im trying to change that about myself... try to be less picky cause I know years from now ... that will be the least of things on our mind as we are 64 and have hip problems lmao ok Good luck peeps. This is like the hunger games.... shit. "

I'm a Muslim, Have been all my life but I'm not super devout to it all, there's more to life than religion. Save the hate if you're going to spew it.

(Preferably not) I'm studying art and cyber security at university! My favorite flavor of ice cream is pistachio. *things i enjoy* Gaming, i got a PC recently (was the first thing i did when i got here! Was build myself a PC) I know my way around computers and enjoy them, i play quite a lot of overwatch and Rainbow six. Music, i like alot of different types of music, indie, alternate rock. Rock and roll. Punk. Anything really! Sports, i enjoy running and swimming although it can be a little hard to do these activities some times. Horror. If its a bit creepy i probably enjoy it, i like conspiracy theory's and unsolved mysteries, true crime, supernatural anything one shouldn't enjoy!  Fashion, if its modest and fits well i follow it. I wear a lot of different modest outfits and some that are less modern! Somedays I will wear an abaya (a long islamic dress) or other days just a hoodie and a hijab! Oh! Also here's me rockin' my hijab (Islamic headscarf) The post got a few DV's on imgur. URL for those who say ""that's not you!"" Or ""It looks like a photograph!"" No. Its a filter. I like filters.
