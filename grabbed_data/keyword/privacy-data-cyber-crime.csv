0,cyber-crime,privacy,Anxious about webcam hacking,2,hcwbbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/hcwbbo/anxious_about_webcam_hacking/,2020-06-21 09:36:47,"I've been using the internet for the last 15-20 years and I only became aware that webcams can be hacked about 6 months ago. Since coming to this realization I now cover my webcam with tape. However I am super anxious that at various points over the last 15-20 years, when I consistently was not covering and obscuring my webcam, that a hacker may have recorded me, and may have distributed videos/images they surreptitiously obtained of me, probably of me doing something super embarrassing. Am I paranoid? Now for context I don't think I have ever received extortion messages from a hacker demanding ransom payments, and I'm male so I'm not an attractive female a hacker might want to spy on for porno purposes, assuming most hackers are straight males. I doubt any government would feel the urge to put me under surveillance as I am not an active extremist political dissident, I have never incited violence or been responsible for hate-speech or ultra seditious rhetoric, I have zero criminal record, and I am privileged enough to have only ever lived in the UK, a relatively equitably governed nation, it's not that authoritarian or corrupt. One reason I am so anxious is because I do not know how commonplace webcam hacking is. I can only think of maybe 3-4 cases reported by the media and I do not know anyone IRL that claims to have been a victim of the offense, even though loads of people are not particularly cautious when it comes to cyber security. I find statistics reassuring, because they often prove how negligible the chances of a violent crime occurring are, even though violent crimes are very theoretically easy to commit. But I have no such statistics for webcam hacking. I cannot vividly remember downloading any malware, but I can't be certain that at some point over the last 15-20 years I never downloaded any malware. Help me please. Thanks."

I'll only use your Email address to send newsletters, and won't sell it to third parties.** ## Google Buys Fitbit And Gets Conditional Approval To Build Smart City In Toronto Google [announced](URL that it's going to [buy](URL the wearable devices company Fitbit. The deal makes sense for Google for the following reasons: In a different deal, Google's parent company Alphabet (via their company Sidewalk Labs) got conditional [approval](URL to [build a smart city in Toronto](URL It's a watered down version of the original plans the company had, but they'll take it anyway. **What is a smart city:** A smart city uses the latest networking, sensory and AI technology. It can improve tracking of all kinds of events and cruically people. There are potentially lots of benefits to make running of a city more effective and efficient. **Why these two events matter from a privacy perspective:** Google is essentially a data company. They already control a large part of the digital world which monitors all kinds of activities of its end users (you and me). Now they are moving into the physical world which also has the potential for extra monitoring (**think:** where you walk, where you drive, what you buy, etc.). How will that impact privacy in the long term? Links: [Google](URL [The Verge](URL [HackRead](URL [Toronto Sun](URL ## Edward Snowden Says Not So Nice Things About Facebook Edward Snowden, the man **infamous for sharing top secret NSA and GCHQ government documents and now living in Moscow**, [says](URL that it's a mistake to think that the NSA is a bigger threat to privacy than big tech companies. He says that's because the whole purpose of Facebook is to collect as much personal data as possible, and to exploit that data as much as they can, regardless of consequences. He's not just saying this about Facebook either because he says Google does the same. **What else is he saying:** **Why is he saying this?** Snowden is promoting his book '[Permanent Record](URL These comments are part of his book promotion. **Finally**, Snowden says that people actually care about their privacy (in response to the common perception that people don't care about their privacy), it's just that they feel powerless to change it \[the current state of privacy affairs\].

Nothing new there! But, one thing that has changed of late, with an impact on privacy, is the rise in popularity of Ring doorbells. These are smart doorbells with cameras and tracking software. This Halloween [Ring has been showing some creepy (pardon the pun) videos of kids trick or treating](URL The creepy part is how easy and open they are about sharing videos of these moments which involve minors. Ring (owned by Amazon) did not respond to questions from Mashable as to whether they received consent in sharing these videos of people (including minors). **Why it matters:** Technology is creeping into many parts of our lives. Should a home owner, or Ring for that matter, be able to publically share 'always on video' of other people (who have not committed a crime)? Links: [Mashable](URL ## The ACLU Sues The FBI, DEA And DoJ Over Use Of Facial Recognition Technology [The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has sued the FBI, DEA and DoJ](URL over their use of facial recognition technology. **What they hope to achieve:** The [ACLU](URL wants to better understand how facial recognition technology is used by the agencies. This includes how they use and audit the software, how they communicate with technology providers and what guidelines and safeguards are in place. **Zoom out:** Using advanced facial recognition software could help US agencies in protecting citizens, protecting borders and catching criminals. **But at what price?** Should law abiding citizens be subject to facial recognition monitoring on a regular basis? And who will be ensuring that the agencies don't go too far? Another aspect to think about is the accuracy of the technology. Currently, it's not perfect and it may match innocent people to profiles of criminals or terrorists. And it turns out the error rates increase for minorities. **Bottom line:** It's not about the technology as such, it's about how it's used and to what extent it can be used.

You can go the **easy** level (e.g., basic password hygiene), the **challenging but doable** level (like switching from Gmail to Protomail, or from Chrome to Firefox), the **hardcore** level (like a Facebook addict quitting cold turkey, or switching from Windows to Linux), and the **extreme** level (like regularly researching the latest privacy threats and locking down everything, frequenting /r/privacy, and pre-ordering the Purism Librem 5. What level are you? Why? How do you explain your level of commitment to privacy? 1. **The easy level.** You want to make it a bit harder for hackers to do damage to your devices, your data, your reputation, or your credit. The idea here is that just as it would be irresponsible to leave your door unlocked if you live in a crime-ridden neighborhood, its irresponsible to use weak passwords and other such things. Youll install a firewall (or, rather, let commercial software do this for you) and virus protection software.If you stop there, you really dont care if corporations or the government spies on you, at the end of the day. Targeted ads might be annoying, but theyre tolerable, you think, and you have nothing to hide from the government. This level is better than nothing, but its also quite irresponsible, in my opinion. Most people are at this level (at best). The fact that this attitude is so widespread is what has allowed corporations, governments, and criminals to get their claws into us. 2. **The challenging but doable level.** You understand that hackers can actually ruin your life, and, in scary, unpredictable circumstances, a rogue corporation or a government could, as well. As unlikely as this might be, we are right to take extra precautions to avoid the worst. Corporate and government intrusions into privacy royally piss you off, and youre ready to do something reasonably dramatic (such as switch away from Gmail), to send a message and make yourself feel better. But you know youll never wholly escape the clutches of your evil corporate and government overlords. You dont like this at all, but youre realistic; you cant escape the system, and youre mostly resigned to it. You just want the real abusers held to account. Maybe government regulation is the solution.This level is better than nothing. This is the level of the Establishment types who want the government to do something about Facebooks abuses, but are only a little bothered by the NSA. I think this level is *still* irresponsible. If youre ultimately OK with sending your data to Google and Facebook, and you trust the NSA, youre still one of the sheeple who are allowing them to take over the world. 3. **The hardcore level.** Now things get interesting. Your eyes have been opened. You know Google and Facebook arent going to stop. Why would they? They *like* being social engineers. They *want* to control who you vote for. Theyre unapologetic about inserting you and your data into a vast corporate machine. Similarly, you know that governments will collect more of your data in the future, not less, and sooner or later, some of those governments will use the data for truly scary and oppressive social control, just as China is doing. If youre at this level, its not just because you want to protect your data from criminals. Its because you firmly believe that technology has developed especially over the last 15 years without sufficient privacy controls built in. You *demand* that those controls be built in now, because otherwise, huge corporations and the largest, most powerful governments in history can monitor us 24/7, wherever we are. This cant end well. We need to completely change the Internet and how it operates.The hardcore level is not just political, its fundamentally opposed to the systems that have developed. This is why you wont just complain about Facebook, youll *quit* Facebook, because you know that if you dont, youre participating in what what is, in the end, a simply evil system. In other ways, youre ready to [**lock down your cyber-life**](URL systematically. Its only a matter of how much you can accomplish. 4. **The extreme level.** The hardcore level isnt hardcore *enough.* Of course corporations and governments are using your data to monitor and control you in a thousand big and small ways. This is one of the most important problems of our time. You will go out of your way, on principle and so that you can help advance the technology, to help lock down everybodys data. Of course you use Linux. Probably, youre a computer programmer or some other techie, so you can figure out how to make the bleeding edge privacy software and hardware work. Maybe you help develop it.The extreme level is beyond merely political. Its not just one cause among many. You live with tech all the time and you demand that every bit of your tech respect your privacy and autonomy; that should be the default mode. Youre already doing *everything* you can to make that how you interact with technology."

8,cyber-crime,privacy,I think I experienced a cyber crime while employed in a major sports league and need help understanding what happened.,4,8xczfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/8xczfc/i_think_i_experienced_a_cyber_crime_while/,2018-07-10 01:57:58,"This turned out longer than I initially planned -- sorry in advance for the essay, but this is just the tip of the iceberg... About 2 years ago, I was working at a media/tech company under the umbrella of a major sports league when this happened. The league's tech side (~2000 people) acquired the software company I worked at (~50 people) in fall 2015. This was my first job right after college in summer 2015 and I was officially hired as the merger was announced. I work in UI design, and my software and IT knowledge was lacking at the time. There are things that happened here that are my own fault, and due to my technical naivety. I'm just looking for advice on what my options are and to understand the situation, not a reprimand for the poor decision-making. I was bringing my personal macbook to the office, and doing most of my work through there for a few months. After the company was acquired, I continued to do so. My work laptop was several years old and too slow for Adobe software that I was using daily. When an employee on my team left, I acquired their newer macbook after the IT guy wiped it, and from that point was using both my work and personal macbooks at the office, taking just my personal one home with me each day. Around late spring of 2016, I started noticing unusual behavior on my work laptop. Recent searches appearing that I never typed, new Spotlight search recommendations like Activity Monitor and Network tools, apps accessed that I never use, files opened that I rarely access, settings changing. One example is with the Dropbox app - my personal account was connected to my work computer, and I noticed my selective sync settings kept changing to sync my personal folders, which I explicitly made sure to exclude. I became more and more suspicious as time went on and thought somebody within the company was accessing my machine remotely. I ended up staying late one Friday night to try to 'fix' it. I thought changing my work computer permissions would stop it, and surprise, it stopped working after that genius idea. I still had my personal computer with me, which I started using at that point. I pinged a coworker on Slack who confirmed that the company does indeed have remote access to our machines through Meraki, and that he uses Little Snitch to block access. He sent me the link to it and I downloaded it. He suggested I boot the work laptop into single user mode to fix those permissions and sent some links to help. At this point, it's 9pm and there's a dev who's also staying late. I tell him what's going on with the permissions and all and he sends me other links, and tells me to run those commands to fix it. None of them work or really change anything. I attempt to call our company 24/7 IT support but it strangely goes to voicemail. I message a few more people on Hipchat, but no one can really help. Eventually, I drive directly home. Once I get home, I see this Little Snitch tool constantly pinging me on my personal machine, but can't recall what they said. I changed some of the settings, which must have opened some kind of network portal into my machine. This is when it starts getting scary. As I attempt to revert the settings, I can see them actively change back and lock, as if I didn't do anything. I keep trying to change this with no luck. Windows start popping on my screen for system settings and I hear that apple lock sound open, which I quickly try to counteract. Essentially, I go into panic mode and start defending my computer against all these attacks which are happening every second. Notifications that looked inauthentic and almost like a fake Apple UI with blurry icons keep popping up requesting my password, which I try to exit from. At some point in the night, I booted into recovery mode (if I recall correctly) and saw what looked like another drive, or connection, something I don't understand that was connected to my computer. I could see what they were doing and saw that they were looking through photos in my Dropbox folder. I realized I could look into their directory as well, and the only folder I was able to see before they disconnected was called Power Management. I can't remember all the details of that night, but it ended with me locking myself out of my own machine when creating a Firmware password, and recall the UI there also looked fake. The password I setup wasn't working. I doubt the security of my home network after all this and was worried about access to private information like bank/email passwords, family info, etc. When I called Apple after the Firmware lockout, they asked me if my operating system was bootleg, and doubted the authenticity of my operating system. I end up taking it to the Apple store that day. What I'm wondering about at this point is, is there a possibility that my panicked experience at home with the obvious remote connection is due to something that happened at work via the network? Could I have downloaded a different version of Little Snitch? Were those commands I ran in single user mode actually granting more permissions? Looking back at the conversations, some of those links were http, so I don't know how easy it is to tamper with those. But here is the real part of the story. I got in the office late that following Monday and was really distraught after messing up both my work and personal computers. The IT guy gave me a loaner machine to use in the meantime and wasn't happy that I took the computer to the Apple store. I am still seeing the activity I saw on my original work machine that prompted my suspicion like recommended Spotlight searches of network activity files and Activity Monitor that never came up in the past (Is it possible this could be done intentionally to make me paranoid?). I end up looking into system logs and console activity and not really understanding what I'm looking at, but I decide to save it all anyway. It starts getting really late at this point, like 2 am and I am there alone. And this is the really fucked up part and I know wasn't just an effect of my paranoia, which I'll get to later. I start to hear noises throughout the office. Two women talking to each other like they're having a conversation. They're whispering to each other, and I can't make out what they're actually saying, but it's loud enough that I can hear them. I start walking around the office trying to find where it's coming from but I can't find them anywhere. I walk around but can't find anyone and it gets silent as soon as I start looking. I try to open some office doors, but some of them are locked. I go back to my desk and continue to save logs. I realize this isn't just management remotely monitoring employees -- there is someone actively mirroring my display and viewing my screen via an Apple TV and various other connected devices. At just the right moment, I'm able to change settings and view their screen, seeing their desktop. It quickly goes back to my screen as they disconnect. I also realize there's a remote connection via a Mac Mini, and I somehow am able to view their widgets screen, and suspect my department head because a lot of the widgets are in his native language. There are other moments where I continue to hear people's voices. At 4am, I hear someone in a locked office go ""What?!"" and then the sound of someone walking a bike, and an exit door close (Looking back, I wonder how I could have heard this so clearly because it was the former CEO's office and is pretty much sound-proof). I also hear the sound of doors closing across the office by the kitchen, but when I go there there is no one there. If you saw the office camera, I would look like some paranoid lunatic running around empty rooms. When I go to the bathroom at one point, I hear two guys talking to each other in the men's bathroom, and in my head I figure that's where they're been hiding. As I walk back to my desk, I see one of the employees walking outside in the distance, the same guy who sent me those links on how to change back my user permissions a few nights ago. At this point it's 7am and the receptionist is making coffee. I start to hear their voices again coming from an office near the main door, and I know I'll catch them this time. As I walk towards this office, the receptionist enters through the main door, and is walking towards me in the opposite direction. And that's when I hear the laughter, very loudly and clearly, positively from that office I'm about to walk into. As I hear the laughter, the receptionist and I both look at each other and I say explicitly, ""You heard that, right?"" and she confirms that she did. When I look into the office, there's no one there. I go back to my desk and see the first dev arrive. He sees that I look very paranoid and freaked out by everything, and it didn't help that I stayed there all night. When I walk away from his area, I hear the first voices I heard of the women. This time, I can clearly hear her say, ""Is she gone?"" and when I go back to his area, I see him standing over an empty desk responding to the voice as if there was someone there. It's only much later on that I realized that all of these voices and sounds were probably transmitted over a speaker of some kind. There is much more that happened afterwards regarding HR, an attempt to escalate the issue, a medical leave of absence after all the trauma, and non-stop verbal harassment when I returned until I had no choice but to quit. The main reason I'm posting this story is because I want to figure out what really happened. I still have the system logs, network activity, Slack conversations, and several screenshots from that night. I don't know how much of it is actually relevant, but if there's something in there that someone with iOS or network security can decipher, I would want to talk to them, if only for my own sanity. All of this raises some very disturbing questions... although companies are legally allowed to monitor your activity, where do you draw the line? At what point does it become an invasion of privacy and malicious behavior? And does all that change when you're talking about a personal computer? I don't know where you draw the line. I'll never be able to prove that I heard those voices, but there could be a chance of something incriminating in those log files. I'm not sure if this is the proper subreddit for this story, and looking for all the help I can get, so I'll be posting to similar channels as well. TLDR: While working at my former job, I experienced remote monitoring on my computer, that led to paranoia and harassment when attempting to escalate the issue. I saved log files and online conversations and want to understand what happened and who to talk to about this."
9,cyber-crime,privacy,How important is physical evidence in cyber crime investigations?,1,4qr31j,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/4qr31j/how_important_is_physical_evidence_in_cyber_crime/,2016-07-01 20:35:24,"Hello people I have seen and read about police raids in cyber crime investigations and the race to get to computers or phones before the suspect can shut them down or destroy them is presented as vital and can either make or break the case. I know that it can likely help build cases where the suspect denies all knowledge but surely with most websites logging IP addresses the case doesn't hinge entirely on getting physical access. To visualize what I'm actually asking imagine I send an email to my friend from my own email address which is traceable to me. In the email I accuse my friend of having an affair with my girlfriend and I'm going to beat him up or kill him or some other threat. He reports me to the police who track me down and arrest me but my computer is encrypted and they can't access it. So they can't prove that there's any evidence on my computer but surely the IP address of the sender tracing back to me, the email account being created from my IP and accessed from it, combined with the total lack of any other suspects with any motive, surely that's enough to convict. My story that a random person hacked into my email account and spoofed my IP address to send that email would certainly be ignored by a jury because it just isn't plausible. So why do I read about cases where the race to get to computers before suspects shut them down as the most important thing upon which the entire case rests?"
10,cyber-crime,privacy,Couple of CISA questions - does it apply to citizens living outside of US? And couple of others.,13,3xkb3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/3xkb3g/couple_of_cisa_questions_does_it_apply_to/,2015-12-20 20:40:37,"I'm still trying to make sense of it so the above question is based on the next one: If I understand it correctly, by companies, they include ISPs right? If so, if I'm not using a US-based ISP, is it enforceable on that end alone? (Again, based on my understanding, they could enforce reddit to disclose my shit since it's routed through its servers based in US - but can they do that with Telnor/Telmex (the major isp company here), which would basically give them free reign on everything I've ever done online through them. A third question is - the bill states that it's directed at terrorist shit but if the info shared contains any evidence of cyber-crime activities those can be admitted along with evidence of.. anything physical.. So basically if I typed to my friend in privacy (free speech I thought), hey I just punched a guy - they don't need a warrant to use that as evidence of a non-cyber crime to persecute me for assault? Basically, does this part simply mean that anything and everything found can be used in court as evidence with absolutely zero warrant of any kind required should they simply suspect me of terrorist activity because I made this post and some disgruntled ex saw it and called in a tip or whatever? Or do they need some kind of a case or an investigation or a warrant or anything before they call up the ISP and say, hey, give us all of his records? edit: In case there is a breakdown of it already (I have only been able to find summaries) can someone link it? Or more specifically, can someone point at the section which directly targets companies like ISPs (if I'm not wrong about that part of it) or even just companies like reddit even if I am. [here is the link to the S.754 text that I'm looking at](URL but a lot of it is jargon that I have to keep looking up and references to other jargon that I have to keep looking up. I feel like this is one of those things I should definitely do a full read through/understand on my own though rather than just rely on summaries etc. edit: Been at it for 2 hours and this is the closest I found (still unclear about the isp issue/who releases the stuff and how that's determined.. everything is very vague). Hopefully someone can help clarify tomorrow. Anyway I found: "" (A) AUTHORIZED ACTIVITIES.Cyber threat indicators and defensive measures provided to the Federal Government under this title may be disclosed to, retained by, and used by, consistent with otherwise applicable provisions of Federal law, any Federal agency or department, component, officer, employee, or agent of the Federal Government solely for (i) a cybersecurity purpose; (ii) the purpose of identifying a cybersecurity threat, including the source of such cybersecurity threat, or a security vulnerability; (iii) the purpose of identifying a cybersecurity threat involving the use of an information system by a foreign adversary or terrorist; **(iv) the purpose of responding to, or otherwise preventing or mitigating, an imminent threat of death, serious bodily harm, or serious economic harm, including a terrorist act or a use of a weapon of mass destruction;** (v) the purpose of responding to, or otherwise preventing or mitigating, a serious threat to a minor, including sexual exploitation and threats to physical safety; or (vi) **the purpose of preventing, investigating, disrupting, or prosecuting an offense arising out of a threat described in clause (iv)**or any of the offenses listed in (I) sections 1028 through 1030 of title 18, United States Code (relating to fraud and identity theft); (II) chapter 37 of such title (relating to espionage and censorship); and (III) chapter 90 of such title (relating to protection of trade secrets). "" shortly after coupled with ""(D) FEDERAL REGULATORY AUTHORITY.

(II) PROCEDURES DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED UNDER THIS TITLE.Clause (i) shall not apply to procedures developed and implemented under this title. "" I still can't find how ISPs play into this but this echoes of how Oliver covered (I don't remember the name of the bill), but the one that allowed the government name anyone a terrorist - patriot act? - which was extended to pretty much everyone listed above in italics and abused by them to strip people of all of their rights because the moment you're a terrorist you're done and they have total freedom to do whatever. Here, the language is so vague in the parts in bold and in italics it can be applied to anything by them. Like, Oliver mentioned how a bank robbery or something could be deemed a terrorist act since it disrupts economy, but here the language is even more vague. ""purpose of (...) investigating"" - this part refers to minors but any 'criminal' with any contact with children would include minors.. and since investigation covers everything pre-trial, you simply go ""I saw that guy with a kid once"" and now he's a cyber threat and that's that? I haven't read through I, II and III references under the bold part yet nor have I found where it says his ISP will have to immediately hand over all of his stuff but since everyone is flipping about it I'm sure it's there (would still like to know where), and so then I point to a guy I don't like, call in a tip, and he's done? I realize it's not 'that' simple but there have been numerous cases of shit going wrong with the bill Oliver mentioned and wrongly used and so on and this is like... I cannot imagine how this vague of a language makes any constitutional sense. But since I'm not a lawyer, it's taking me a while to make sense of it."

Some criminals and bad people eat ice cream. Some criminals and bad people drive cars. Some criminals and bad people use the Internet. Some criminals and bad people use Tails, the Tor Browser, and the Tor Network. Does this mean that law-abiding and good people should not eat ice cream, should not drive cars, should not use the Internet, and should not use Tails, the Tor Browser, and the Tor Network? The correct and true answer is an emphatic, "" No!"" Tor: URL Tails, The Amnesic Incognito Live System: URL Tor Project: URL Tails: URL Tails, the Tor Browser, and the Tor Network are totally legal to use in the United States and other democratic countries. Tails, the Tor Browser, and the Tor Network will prevent any government or corporation from identifying you, tracking and recording your Internet activities, identifying your physical location, identifying your computer IP address, identifying your computer location, and identifying your web communications. You can prevent such spying right now by using Tails, the Tor Browser, and the Tor Network every time you connect to the Internet. You can use the Tor Browser and the Tor Network without using Tails, but it is best to use Tails, the Tor Browser, and the Tor Network together. When you use Tails, you automatically will use the Tor Browser that is included with Tails, and the Tor Browser automatically will connect to the encrypted anonymous Tor Network only. The Tor Browser is a browser that uses free libre open source software. Tails is a free self-contained computer system that you download and install on a DVD disk and on a USB flash drive. Instead of starting your computer with Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, or other operating system, use your Tails DVD or USB flash drive to start up your computer. Tails includes the debian Linux operating system. When you use Tails to start up your computer, the user-friendly debian Linux operating system will start your computer instead of Windows, Mac, or other operating system. Tails includes everything you might need when you use a computer and the Internet. Tails includes the debian Linux operating system, the Tor Browser, software applications, utilities, and system files. When you use Tails, you remain anonymous and private on the Internet. With Tails, no party can track you across the web unless you enter your real name, address, phone number, personal email address, date of birth, or other personally identifying information on a web site. When you use Tails, the Five Eyes, other government trackers, and corporate trackers cannot identify you, cannot determine your location, cannot determine the location of your computer, and cannot track you. Note: the Five Eyes, or FVEY in official government documents, comprise the governments of Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, and New Zealand, which is the largest spy network on Earth. Tails = TheAmnesicIncognitoLiveSystem Tails = anonymity, privacy, and freedom from tracking. In early 2015, the documentary film, Citizenfour, starring Edward Snowden and others, received an Academy Award . At the end of the film, the credits include Tails and Tor. If you are not using Tails, one or more governments and one or more corporations are tracking and recording permanently your web activities and communications 100% of the time when you have an Internet connection. When you are using Tails, governments, corporations, and other trackers cannot identify you, your location, your computer IP address, or the web sites with which you connect. You remain anonymous and untraceable. Read the information and documentation on the Tor Project web site and on the Tails web site to better use the Tor Browser, the Tor Network, and Tails. Bear in mind that 100% security is not achievable by anyone, any system, or any thing. In my opinion, if you are not using Tails, the Tor Browser, and the Tor Network, you have 0% privacy, 0% anonymity, and 0% freedom from tracking. However, in my opinion, near 100%, maybe 99.9999...%, is achievable if you use Tails, the Tor Browser, and the Tor Network. On the Tails and Tor Project web sites, read the warnings and documentation that discuss the fact that 100% security is not achievable for any person, government, or system. When you use Tails, the Tor Browser, and the Tor Network, you will have the highest possible levels of privacy, anonymity, and freedom from tracking unless you vaporize your computer and all of your web devices in an incinerator and never use the Internet again for the remainder of your life. When you are using Tails, you can use the secure Claws email program that comes with Tails. With Claws, you can send emails securely, anonymously, and safely without having to identity yourself or your location. Additionally, when using the Tor Browser, you can use any web-based email service provider. You can register for a free email account with many web-based email service providers without having to enter your real name, phone number, or personal email address. The following sites include some of the free email service providers and lists of such email service providers; you can find more by doing a web search: URL URL URL URL If you want to stop the US government, other governments, corporations, and other trackers from tracking and recording all of your web activities right now, first download the Tor Browser installer program from the Tor Project web site: URL After you download the Tor Browser installer file, close your traditional browser, such as Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc, open the Tor Browser installer file, and install the Tor Browser on your computer. After you have installed the Tor Browser, open it and connect again to the Tor Project web site to read the instructions and information on the site about the Tor Browser and the Tor Network. Use the Tor Browser every time you connect to the Internet. The Tor Browser automatically will establish your Internet connection via the encrypted anonymous Tor Network. In my experience, the Tor Browser and the Tor Network actually are easier to use than a traditional web browser and the unencrypted and un-anonymous traditional Internet network. After you have used the Tor Browser and understand the basics of using it and the Tor Network, download Tails: URL On the Tails site, read the site's information and follow the instructions in the Tails Documentation, which has all of the necessary information that you will need to install Tails on a DVD disk and a USB flash drive. Begin using Tails as soon as you can. BACKGROUND ABOUT WHY EVERYONE SHOULD USE TAILS ---- The Five Eyes organization has existed for 70 years. Current US laws do not prevent the governments of the other four members of the Five Eyes, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, from spying on people inside the United States, and that is exactly what they have been doing for years. Today, the governments of each of the Five Eyes members have official agreements with each other to spy on people inside the countries of the other members of the Five Eyes. The United Kingdom government spies on everybody inside the United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. The United States government spies on everybody inside the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, and so on... This is how each government circumvents domestic laws in each country that make it illegal for each government to spy on their own populations. Each member of the Five Eyes spies on the populations in the other four countries. Each member of the Five Eyes swap that information with each other. No domestic laws exist to prevent the swapping of the spy data. The goal of the Five Eyes is to spy on every person, every organization, every corporation, and every institution on Earth, including you, your friends, your family, and your associates and to share that information between the spy agencies of the Five Eyes. If you are not using Tails, the Tor Browser, and the Tor Network to connect to the Internet, the United States government and the other four governments of the Five Eyes are tracking and recording all of you web activities and all of your Internet communications and emails, including everything you do, every site you use, everything you write, everything you buy, everything you sell, and everything you say over an Internet connection. In official government documents, the government abbreviates Five Eyes as ""FVEY"": URL At the same time, other governments could be tracking you, including China, North Korea, Iran, Russia, and others because, they too, track users across the web. If you have ever used the Internet without using Tails, the Tor Browser, and the Tor Network, each of the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand own or have fast access to a file about you, including all of your web activities, all of your emails, and information about your personal life. If you are using the web to read this, but you are not using Tails, the Tor Browser, and the Tor Network, the Five Eyes, other governments, corporations, and blackhat hackers are tracking and recording your activities on the web. For many years, some government officials and government agencies inside the United States and other democratic nations have been brainwashing the public to 'feel' that only criminals and bad people use Tails, the Tor Browser, and the Tor Network. For many years, a mostly obedient US corporate media industry has been cooperating with the United States government to brainwash the US public by failing to report the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth about cyber privacy and privacy and anonymity tools, such as Tails, the Tor Browser, and the Tor Network. This pact between the US government and the US corporate media industry entails a propaganda campaign of immense effect that has misinformed and frightened many members of the US public into avoiding the use of tools that protect their privacy, anonymity, freedom from tracking, and freedom from spying. Government security agencies in the Five Eyes, especially the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), aim to to track you and record every detail of your personal life. In the US, the government wants you to feel that it is OK if the government tracks you and records every detail of your personal life. The US government wants you to feel bad, guilty, and frightened about the idea of using tools that give you privacy, anonymity, and freedom from tracking. The US goverment wants you to have no personal privacy, no anonymity, and no freedom from tracking. If you have lived in the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, other Western European countries, Canada, Australia, or New Zealand, you know that the situation in those countries is vastly superior and is nearly the opposite of the situation in the US. The governments in those countries have the best and strongest privacy laws on Earth, unlike the US, which has weak and ineffective privacy laws that are closer to the laws of Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China than they are to privacy laws in Western European nations, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. This is hard for most Americans, who have never lived in Western Europe, Canada, Australia, or New Zealand, to grasp and accept, just like it is impossible for the brainwashed population of North Korea to grasp and accept that the Leader of North Korea was not born on top of a sacred mountain peak, is not descended directly from god, that North Korea is not the best country on Earth, and that North Korea has the most ruthless and oppressive government on Earth, where the government can send you and three generations of your family to prison for life or can kill you and send three generations of your family to prison for life if you try to use the Internet. Most of the North Korean population thinks this is normal and good because North Koreans begin living their lives under a strict regime of pervasive government brainwashing that permeates the fabric of North Korea society and begins on the day of birth. The privacy laws of Western European countries, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are much stronger than US privacy laws, and US privacy laws are closer to the privacy laws of Russia, North Korea, Iran, and China than they are to the privacy laws of Western European nations, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. However, many Americans feel that government spying on their personal lives and not having personal privacy is OK like most North Koreans think it is OK for the government to imprison or execute them you if they try to use the Internet. It's called brainwashing. Most brainwashed people don't know that they are brainwashed unless they are good observers, thinkers, readers, and learners with open minds that can pierce the veil. In Russia, Iran, China, and North Korea, no one has the right to freedom of speech, privacy, and anonymity unless someone is a member of the privileged elite at the top of the ruling class or at the top of the government leadership. In Russia, Iran, China, and North Korea, you have no legal right to privacy and no freedom of speech. Those governments do imprison and kill people for what they speak and write. Today, the United States is gradually drawing closer to that situation as the US police state steadily continues to wrap its tentacles around society and increasingly tightens the grip of the police state to choke the life out of the right of personal privacy, the right to be anonymous, and the right to be free from tracking and monitoring. Today, in the United States, people still have the legal right to privacy, still have the legal right to be anonymous if that is what they want, still have the legal right to freedom from tracking across the web, and still have the legal right of freedom of speech. Nevertheless, today, the United States government and some other democratic governments have secretive agencies that spy on you 100% of the time when you use the web. You easily can prevent such spying and tracking by using Tails, the Tor Browser, and the Tor Network. Today, the United States has hollow and ineffective laws to prevent tracking, recording, and spying on the personal lives of people. Today, in the US, some new laws are supposed to go into effect in a few months to curtail spying by the US government on Internet and phone users in the US. In my opinion, only fools think the new laws really will do what they are supposed to do after the new laws go into effect. The spying will continue, and it will become much worse than it is today if the country continues to follow the same direction it has taken during the past 13 years since 9/11. Today, some people inside and outside of the US government are working hard to undermine and destroy the right to personal privacy in the United States and the constitutional rights in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. Today, the Director of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), James B. Comey, officials inside the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and other officials in the US intelligence community are hammering Members of the United States Congress to pass laws that would outlaw the use of effective encryption software by most people in the US, which, in turn, would move the country another dangerous step closer to undermining or destroying the legal right of privacy put forth in the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. At the same time, today, the same US government officials are hammering on Members of Congress to pass laws that will force all US companies to install secret backdoors in all computers, smartphones, and other Internet devices so that the government can turn on your computer, smartphone, or other device while you are sleeping or at any other time to make digital, audio, and video recordings of anything and everything that you are doing 24 hours per day. Those government officials want the government to have the power to track and follow you like a cattle rancher with 50,000 heads of cattle can track the cattle because all of the cattle have a computer chip in their ear flaps, and the cattle are surrounded by electrified and barbed wire fences to monitor and control their lives from the craddle to the butchers block. Amendment IV to the United States Constitution is a part of the Bill of Rights: The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. Today, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) is one of the laws of the United States government. Former President George W. Bush approved and signed into law the original version of the NDAA. President Barack Obama has signed and fully supporrts the current updated version of the NDAA that gives the government even more power over the people than the Bush version had over the people. The NDAA gives the US government the legal right to detain any person without charge, indefinitely, for the remainder of that person's life. The NDAA gives the US government the legal right to detain any person without filing any formal charge that states the nature of the detainee's alleged offense. The NDAA gives the US government the legal right to deny any detainee the right to a trial in a court of law to determine whether the prisoner is guilty or innocent of a crime. The NDAA gives any current or future president of the United States the legal right to order the execution and death without trial of any person who is a US citizen or who is not a US citizen if the president thinks that person should die. NDAA: URL Today, historians, academics, intellectuals, think tanks, and experts around the world think that the current political and social situation in the United States is beginning to take on the character and follow the path of the birth of the Nazi government and the Third Reich of Adolf Hitler beginning in the early 1930s, when the German government first started detaining, imprisoning, and executing anybody without charge and without trial. By the end of WWII in Europe in 1945, the Nazi government and Hitler's Third Reich had executed around 6 million Jews and around 5 million non-Jews whom the Nazis decided to kill because the Nazis thought that Jews, homosexuals, the physically disabled, the mentally disabled, people with low IQs, and others were subhumans who did not deserve to live. Today, many officials in the US Congress, the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and other US agencies have a mindset much like Hitler's Nazis, especially FBI Director James Comey who I think would have fit in perfectly with the Third Reich and Hitler's regime if he had been a Nazi government official during the Holocaust. Of course, today Comey argues to Congress that what he thinks and wants to do is right, like government officials inside the Nazi regime argued that what they thought and wanted to do was right. Today, most Americans have been brainwashed into thinking that the US government is the best on Earth despite the fact that the US has more people in prison and jails, more than 2 million, of any other country on Earth, has more homeless people and people living in poverty than any other developed democratic nation on earth, has 38 million people who have no health insurance, and has one of the highest rates of homicide and violence of all countries on Earth, which puts the US closer to the levels of murder, homicide, and violence that exist in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, some Central American countries, Venezuela, some African countries, and other countries that have exceedingly high rates of violence, murder, and homicide in their cities, towns, and rural areas. Western European countries, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, and many other countries have much lower rates of homicide, murder, and violence than the US, and their cops don't go around murdering people almost every day, especially white cop on black person murders and killings. Some people think that for every known murder by a cop in the US, there might be 10-200 murders by cops in the US that are unknown, which is much like the situations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Russia, North Korea, and other police states where it is common for cops to murder, injure, and brutalize people every day.
