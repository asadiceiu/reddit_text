Getting ready for a forklift network upgrade across a dozen small sites. All have private WAN links back to a central datacenter. Onsite old IOS routers are being replaced by Sophos UTMs, on which I despise the DHCP management. So I've been replicating the utterly ridiculous list of pools on each router in the DHCP cluster and cutting the interfaces over to DHCP relay. DAI, dhcp snooping, and 802.1x are all going live when the switches arrive. Now I'm getting some blowback on the phone and printer networks pulling DHCP from the servers being a ""security risk"". The concern is more what the auditors will say than anything, but I'm curious what you guys think. Does relaying DHCP traffic from a device to a server present a security risk to the server? Do you deploy independent DHCP solutions for each vlan you're supposed to isolate? Personally, I believe centralizing DHCP represents a security boon. IPAM beats the crusty spreadsheets any day. In this specific case, all vlans hit the same firewall, travel the same tunnel, and use the same remote firewall to hit the outside or interior networks as needed. I know Cisco has CVE-2017-12240 relay vulnerabilities, but A) that's the relay, not the server, and B) we're not going to be using a Cisco implementation."

We take credit cards through a small card reader connected to the ethernet and do not store any card info locally. We have two locations that are connected via a site to site Cisco VPN (RV042G) and I believe it may be causing some of the failures. Listed below are all of the failure points reported by Trustwave: Block cipher algorithms with block size of 64 bits (like DES and 3DES) birthday attack known as Sweet32, CVE-20162183 SSL Certificate Public Key Too Small SSLv3 Supported TLSv1.0 Supported SSL version 3 protocol padding oracle attack (POODLE), CVE2014-3566 SSL/TLS Weak Encryption Algorithms, CVE-2013-2566 CVE-2015-2808 I have been doing research for days on what these are and how to fix them but have gotten nowhere. Our two stores are being charged monthly for these failures and I have been tasked with the job of becoming compliant. I have seen the suggestion for adding another phone line for the credit reader but that would increase our monthly cost, which is not an option. It was suggested to use the provided fixes from Trustwave but I could not find anything that resembled a fix for any of the vulnerabilities. I have read many fixes on forums for some of these vulnerabilities but nowhere do they specify where I am actually making these fixes. I have 3 Windows workstations at my office and there are about 6 workstations and 2 servers at our other location. In my office, I have an ISP provided modem converting the cable to an off the shelf wi-fi AP. I can update this post with the networking hardware for our other location as it has been over a year since I have been there. Our server is used or Quickbooks and OSticket but we ran a scan with them turned off and we still failed. (The listed failures are strictly for my office and not the second location.) My first plan has been to set up two PFSense firewalls containing our out of data VPN in a form of a DMZ so that the external scan would not see the issues. But learning the software has been a bit of a hurtle. I'm sure with time I will get the hang of it but for now, I just wanted to make sure I am not wasting my time. As far as Windows vulnerabilities I always make sure all workstations are all updated, and I am always up to date on infosec twitter to make sure none of our customers/office has any open 0days. I considered myself pretty technical but these vulnerabilities have been kicking my ass so any input would be greatly appreciated. If anybody needs any more information let me know. Thanks again. "

Our ASA has four interfaces: * Inside: 10.100.1.1/24 * Outside: &lt;public IP&gt; * DMZ1: 172.100.0.1/24 * DMZ2: 172.200.0.1/24 Internet is fine, site-2-site tunnels are fine, remote access AnyConnect VPN is fine, inter-site access is fine - the only thing that doesn't work is DMZ2. Both DMZ1 and DMZ2 connect to separate, unrouted VLANs on an 24 port HP procurve: DMZ1 gets ports 1-12 and DMZ2 get 13-24. DMZ2 is fine: the forward-facing servers can be accessed by remote machines and we can manage the machines via the Inside interface. DMZ1 won't pass any traffic. The interface is up, its duplex/speed is fine, etc. By all accounts everything should be working since the config wasn't changed before the firmware update. However there's no MAC addresses in its ARP table for any of the hosts connected to its portion of the switch. I tried connecting a laptop directly to the interface and I can't ping the interface, let alone anything past it and my laptop's MAC doesn't show up on the ASA. I opened a case with TAC though I haven't worked with a tech yet. Good times. **Update 1:** The TAC tech switched the DMZ configs from gi0/2 to gi0/5. After that I was able to connect up a laptop to the DMZ switch and ping the gateway address, at this point the tech felt that the issue was resolved but I still couldn't ping the DMZ hosts from the Inside network and those DMZ hosts couldn't ping the DMZ gateway. But here's the kicker; for the sake of brevity in the original text I didn't mention that I updated two other ASAs at different locations with the same 9.4.2.6 firmware. All of those ASAs have the same DMZ configuration with a switch connected to Gi0/2. I didn't realize this at the time of my original post but all three ASAs had the exact same symptoms. As /u/medster10 said, once I rolled back to 9.4.1 everything worked. Let this be a lesson to all you youngsters just starting out; no matter how trivial or benign you think your network changes are, make a configuration backup before you do anything. If I hadn't made a backup before the TAC ""tech"" had his way with my ASA I would have spent at least another hour undoing his mess after I rolled back to my working firmware. **Update 2 - 2/15/16** I'd just like to mention that I don't actually use non-RFC 1918 compliant addresses for the DMZ networks. I was just trying to generalize the config as much as possible and in my haste I chose poorly. The TAC tech was not helpful. Once my laptop started pinging the interface on gi0/5 he basically said the issue was resolved and rushed to get me off of the phone. I protested saying that the other hosts connected via switch to that interface still weren't showing up in the ARP table on the ASA and he shifted blame to the switch, even though my laptop was connected to that switch and was showing up in the ARP table. I get it from his perspective that he doesn't have any knowledge of the configuration of that switch, etc, but I was telling him that the only thing that changed was the firmware on the ASA and he totally blew me off. Had I known at that time that my other ASAs were exhibiting the same symptoms I would have had more leverage to pursue the matter but, as it was, I had internally decided to roll back the firmware so I decided not to fight with him. I have yet to have even a single positive experience with Cisco TAC, but I digress. So at this point we're stuck on a vulnerable firmware until Cisco releases a stable patched firmware."

URL URL bugreport: URL The vulnerability relies on an oversized (2048+ bytes) UDP or TCP response, which is followed by another response that will overwrite the stack, Serna said. Our suggested mitigation is to limit the response (i.e., via DNSMasq or similar programs) sizes accepted by the DNS resolver locally as well as to ensure that DNS queries are sent only to DNS servers which limit the response size for UDP responses with the truncation bit set. Google said that a number of exploitation vectors can be used to attack this vulnerability, including but not limited to ssh, sudo and curl. Remote code execution is possible, but not straightforward, Serna said. It requires bypassing the security mitigations present on the system, such as ASLR. - See more at: URL TLDR: It seems that blocking DNS resolver responses inbound to packet sizes of 1024 should help mitigate the issue until patches can be rolled out for the millions upon millions of platforms ~~(including android)~~ that seem to be effected by this bug.

27,CVE,networking,CVE-2015-7547 mitigation with DNS config update,0,47drs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/47drs7/cve20157547_mitigation_with_dns_config_update/,2016-02-25 04:38:23,"According to Google and the bug report for CVE-2015-7547, this vulnerability can be mitigated by limiting the DNS response size to a max of 2048 bytes. This is the approach we're considering to buy us some time while we patch all the things. However, after asking the Ops folks to update DNS, I got a bit of pushback since they couldn't find how to do it via the settings (using Windows DCs for DNS). Doing a bit of research (aka googling), I found the following article, which deals with configuring MaximumUdpPacketSize for DNS: URL I guess I wanted to ask more knowledgable folks (you guys) before I pass on the recommendation to the Ops team: would setting MaximumUdpPacketSize to 2048 effectively mitigate this vuln, at least for UDP requests? As for TCP, I haven't been able to find a config setting for that by just googling, so if you could help me with that, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks in advance!"

Affects all OpenSSH 5.4 - 7.1: Apply the workaround and wait for an upcoming release. *edit: fixed recommended workaround to apply globally*"
29,CVE,networking,More Information on the Juniper ScreenOS Authentication Backdoor...,63,3xnirx,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/3xnirx/more_information_on_the_juniper_screenos/,2015-12-21 13:44:13,"**[...in this blog post](URL &gt;The argument to the strcmp call is `&lt;&lt;&lt; %s(un='%s') = %u`, which is the backdoor password, and was presumably chosen so that it would be mistaken for one of the many other debug format strings in the code. This password allows an attacker to bypass authentication through SSH and Telnet, as long as they know a valid username. If you want to test this issue by hand, telnet or ssh to a Netscreen device, specify a valid username, and the backdoor password. If the device is vulnerable, you should receive an interactive shell with the highest privileges. **edit: It seems like a valid username is not required for this to work.** (thanks to /u/spann0r)"
