Operational history** *Kuroshio* was ordered at the **Fujinagata Shipyard** in Osaka in 1936, under the ***Maru-San (Circle Three)*** Naval Program. She was laid down on August 31, 1937 and launched on October 25, 1938 (late happy birthday). *Kuroshio*\-chan was assigned to **Destroyer Division 15**, **Destroyer Squadron 2**, **2nd Fleet** with *Oyashio* (also a shipfu of the event, yay!), *Hayashio* and *Natsushio. Kuro* was put under the command of ***Commander*** **Ugaki Tamaki** on January 27, 1940. Immediately after completing her training, *Kuroshio* participated in the **16th Combined Fleet Exercise** of the **Combined Fleet**, and got into her first trouble. At about 18:00 on June 23, 1941, *Kuro-chan* repeatedly crashed into her sisters *Natsushio* and *Minegumo* in the Bungo Strait (ramming two other ships at the same time is lmao :V), causing her to be drydocked at Kure for 1 month. By the time *Kuroshio* was back in action, war with the Americans was imminent. On November 26, 1941, *Kuroshio* and **DesDiv 15** moved to Palau to prepare for the invasion of the Philippines with *Flatuj* the same day as the **attack on Pearl Harbor**. On December 6-8, when the war broke out, *Kuroshio* escorted *Ryuj* to bomb Davao before accompanying *Oyashio* to escort minelayer *Itsukushima* to lay mines in the San Bernardino Strait on November 10-11. She also participated in shelling Legaspi (December 12) and Davao (December 20) to assist the Army. Sailors of *Kuro-chan* and *Jints* also participated in the landings in Bandasan. On December 23, *Kuro-chan* suffered her first battle damage when a B-17 gun strafed on the deck, killing four sailors (no one is clear about the fate of this B-17 after the incident tho :V). In December 1941-January 1942, *Kuro-chan* participated in the invasions of Jolo (December 25, 1941), Menado (January 11, 1942), Kendari (January 14) and Ambon (January 31) in the Dutch East Indies. On February 8, 1942, fellow destroyer *Natsushio* was sunk by USS *S-37*'s torpedoes (the first kill of US submarines in the war :V) when participating in landing support on Makassar, which *Kuroshio* had to assist her survivors. In revenge for this, *Kuro-chan* and *Oyashio* sank a Tea minelayer. Afterwards, *Kuroshio*\-chan returned to Staring-baai Bay on March 11 and escorted *Kaga* to Japan at the end of March 1942. After a period of rest and refit, *Kuroshio* resumed operations after *Hornet*'s B-25s raid on Japanese soil (**Dolittle's Raid** to anyone who didn't know). After a few days of unsuccessful search, she returned to Panay, Philippines on April 28, 1942. From May 1 to 9, *Kuroshio* assisted in the capture of Cagayan Island before returning to Manila. After the **Battle of the Coral Sea**, she escorted damaged *Shkaku* back to Kure on 17 May before traveling to Saipan to escort troopships to capture Midway. Of course, everyone knows that the Japanese Navy was crushed (it was not Jewcat telling secret to the Allied!), So the landing ships escorted by *Kuro-chan* must return to Saipan. After a resupply in Saipan, *Kuroshio*\-chan joined *Kumano* and *Suyuza* to attack enemy supply line in the Indian Ocean. However, the mission was canceled and the fleet had to return to July 30 as the Americans began landing on Guadacanal. On August 24, *Kuro-chan* continued to escort *Kumano* and *Suyuza* and the cranes at the **Battle of the East Solomons** before patrolling around Truk throughout September 1942. In early October, **Kuroshio** escorted several ***""Tokyo Express""*** convoys to Guadacanal before escorting Kong and Haruna shelling Henderson Field. On October 26, little *Kuroshio* continued to escort *Jun'y* to the **Battle of Santa Cruz**. This battle, *Jun'y* contributed to sinking *Hornet* and causing great deal of damage to *South Dakota* and *San Juan*. The lack of food for the 17th Army forced *Kuroshio* to run ***""******Tokyo Express""*** convoys to bring supplies to the army. During the third food shipment on November 30, *Kuroshio* was blocked by TG 67 of the US Navy. Because *Kuro-chan* had to ship food, she only brought 8 torpedoes, just enough for 1 full broadside of torpedo. At 23:06 on November 29, the US fleet spotted *Takanami*, who was escorting the shipper, on radar. Realizing that the destroyer fleet was detected by the US reconnaissance aircraft and radar, ***Captain*** **Raiz Tanaka**, commander of the shipper's fleet () decided to leave the army and fight the Americans in what would become the **Battle of Tassafaronga** at 23:16. At that time, American destroyers spotted the Japanese fleet and fired 20 torpedoes at 23:20. 1 minute later, *Minneapolis* and the cruisers began firing. Because of being so close to the US fleet to protect shipper deliveries, Takanami was destroyed after 4 minutes of fire from the heavy cruisers. However, luckily for the Japanese, the American torpedoes missed. Had they hit the Japanese fleet, the outcome of the battle would have been changed. At 23:23, *Naganami*, *Suzukaze* and *Kawakaze* began to deploy smoke and open fire on the American ships. *Naganami* fired all her 8 torpedoes, then 1 minute later, *Suzukaze* and *Kawakaze* continued to do the same (insert Dj Vu meme here) at 23:32 and 23:33. *Minneapolis* was hit by two torpedoes at 23:27, causing her to lose power and steering gear, and lost her turret number 1. Just less than a minute later, *New Orleans* was hit by 2 torpedoes, causing the bow of the ship to say goodbye to her hull and also knocked out her first two turrets. The bow of *Orleans* was sunk immediately, killing 183 sailors. *Orleans* completely lost communication, steering and propulsion. Meanwhile, *Kuroshio* fired 4 torpedoes and *Oyashio* fired all her 8 Long Lance against the US. Seven minutes later, a torpedo launched by *Kuroshio* hit *Pensacola*, killing 125 sailors and made the her tilted by 13 degrees, cutting off *Pensacol*a's communications and propulsion. By 23:48, it was *Northampton*'s turn to be hit by two *Kawakaze*'s or *Oyashio*'s torpedoes that caused her to be tilted 10 degrees. Furthermore, *Northampton* was heavily flooded and burnt. 50 people were killed. The crew of *Northampton* abandoned the ship at 01:30 on 1 December before the ship sank at 03:04 Meanwhile, ***Captain*** **Tanaka** orders the Japanese shippers to flee at 23:44. *Kuroshio* and *Kager* launched 12 torpedoes before she and *Oyashio* came to assist *Takanami*. Although she saw *Takanami* at around 01:00 on December 1, she and *Oya*\-chan had to flee when she saw the 'Murican cruisers. The **Battle of Tassafaronga** was one of the resounding victories of the Japanese against the US Navy. They sank a heavy cruiser (*Northampton*) and disabled three other heavy cruisers in almost a year (*New Orleans*, *Minneapolis* and *Pensacola*) for just only one destroyer (*Takanami*). After the battle, *Kuroshio* also participated in five food shipments to Guadacanal until January 1943, along with two troop transports to Munda. On January 10, 1943, she became the flagship of the shipper's fleet and participated in a few more trips to evacuate the army from Guadacanal when the situation became too bad for the Japanese. While evacuating the army from Guadacanal on February 4, *Kuroshio* almost got hit by a bomb. On February 16, she escorted *Jun'y* to Kure and was repaired there. *Kuroshio* was put under a new command of *Umikaze*'s former captain, ***Commander*** **Sugitani Nagahide**. In April 1943, *Kuroshio* escorted *Chkai* and 2 CVEs *Chuy* and *Taiy* to Truk. After chilling for a few days at Truk, *Kuro*\-chan went to Shortland Island to continue transporting soldiers to Kolombangara. However, on the third shipment, *Kuroshio* and her sisters were caught in a trap set by the Americans. On the night of May 6-7, 1943, *Radford-*chan led three minelaying destroyers to around 250 mines in the Blackett Strait area. About 24 hours later, *Kuroshio* and her sisters passed through this area to bring troops to Buin, completely oblivious to the appearance of the dog's shi... I meant mines. *Oyashio* struck by a mine which knocked out her propulsion. Just a few minutes later, *Kager* also struck a mine. *Kuroshio* to stay to take care of her 2 sisters. However, about an hour later, *Kuro-chan* was shaken by 5 big explosions. The first two explosions were due to a mine which *Kuro* had struck and the subsequent explosions were from *Kuroshio*'s own magazine. She was completely destroyed and sunk within seconds. On June 20, 1943, *Kuroshio* was removed from the Navy List. She joined in one of the destroyers who made the most of ***""Tokyo Express""*** convoys, only behind her sister *Kager* with 14 trips. **IV. Evaluation** (will be post next episode of Oyashio) **V. In Azur Lane** &amp;#x200B; [In-game Kuroshio](URL *Kuroshio* was introduced into the game in the event **""Return Of The War God""**. She is a Rare ship. *Kuroshio* can only be obtained from the Limited Pool of the event with a build time of 00:27:00. *Kuro-chan* has three skills: **""Full Firepower""** (trying to find out the historical reference), **""Double Torpedo""** (maybe because she launched 2 waves of fishes during Tassafaronga) and **""All Out Assault""** (class specification). All of her skills are Attack skill (RIP shikikans who don't have that many of Red books). She has got 3 equipment slots for: DD Guns (70%-75%), Torpedoes (130%-150%) and AA Guns (70%-75%). *Kuroshio* is a ninja (or so) because she was heavily involved in night operations. *Kuro-chan*'s self-introduction line tells us a part of her history. Her flower on her hair was a gift from *Oyashio*, according to Secretary 3. *Kuro* has one Additional Line when sortie with *Akatsuki*. **VI. Sources** *1.
