I have been fooled and scammed by someone. Normally i wouldn't give a shit but this particular guy, i felt bad and helped him just to find out he has been lying this whole time. What pissed me is the fact he told lies about his sister and parents death to gain sympathy. I'll give the whole details and provide with ss in pm to whoever decided to help me out. I also have his national identity card and could potentially ruin his life but i don't want to do that. Would rather scare the shit out of him to make sure he doesn't do this again in the future. Note: only reason i helped him without hesitation is because we went to same school when i was in Pakistan"
1,cyber-crime,pakistan,"I saw target killers, terrorists and dacoits on streets but PTA thinks pubg will make me violent and self harm.",1,hjqbgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/hjqbgo/i_saw_target_killers_terrorists_and_dacoits_on/,2020-07-02 14:28:14,"It's the laziest solution if you think about it, just ban it. Ban and cancel culture in Pakistani bureaucracy and judiciary is going on since I can remember. Our parents and elders always blame video games and movies for violence in society. They forget we are the same generation that has lived through terrorism and war against terrorism. We have seen blood shed on the streets, bombings and dacoits firing on the streets. I remember I was on Karachi streets on 12 May 2007, just a school kid when I saw people firing on Rashid Minhas road. I was running with my friends as teenagers away from where the firing was coming from. We hid inside a gaming zone near Nipa Chowrangi for 6 to 8 hours. In the gaming area the owner locked us in and left so that we will be safe that way. We called police and our parents were worried sick but we had no help and no where to go. We were just kids scared for our lives and at that time of utter chaos. At that moment we realized that we are in a gaming arena. We started to play games, we played to get away from what was going on outside. We played every game we can. Gaming was our escape route from literal violence on our doorsteps. And yes, we were playing counter strike, ironically. I looked out of the window that day I saw the target killers firing from top of the bridge on innocent people with another guy carrying an MQM flag cheering ""jiye mutahida"" . I haven't been so scared at that moment. After maghrib police came and the owner came and opened the door. Then we took a ride with police to a safer place. From there I walked home, I just told my father what happened and not my mother because I thought she will be too scared. This is the environment we were raised in and I am sure everyone in the country has similar experiences. But pubg and gaming is not the problem, the society is the problem that blames gaming for shortcomings in the parenting and growth of children. I had PTSD from the incident but never knew what it was. It took me long time to recover from it. Typical Pakistani solution is ban the games because it's the only source of violence for kids. See the society outside kids can see violence everywhere. PTA is a lazy organization from attacking VPNs to games, it doesn't do anything good. Literally everyday I get fraud calls and texts on my phone that I report but these people are never banned. One son of our maid was defrauded few thousand rupees because the guy on phone told him he is from govt and he has won a plot and this stupid guy sent him money. These fraud, cyber crime and illegal activities should be banned and not gaming. I once got a call from a guy saying I have won lottery that I never played. He wanted money. I reported his number on PTA helpline and with my Telco. 3 days later same guy called again with same number, he wasn't banned because according to PTA that was OK. Stay blessed everyone."

Source: URL And that's just Facebook. Imagine other platforms collaborating with the government. Also, we do know about our local law which now includes cyber-crime law, don't we? It can be used to book anyone online who won't conform with state's interpretation of shariah. And once booked for blasphemy, then courts are effectively useless for justice as it only a matter of time before a mob lynches you. We are at the whim of uneducated-extremists who would effectively pass whatever mullah-military decide for our future. They don't give a shit about change. Amidst all chaos which started from state persecution of activists and bloggers, it's high time that you guys acquaint yourself with tools mentioned in wiki of r/privacy. Considering the timing of abductions, blocking of Facebook pages, and the pressure on national media against those who don't conform with the policies of state, it doesn't take a genius to figure out if state is complicit or not. If you care about freedom of speech, you have to take extra precautions for social networks such as Facebook and twitter. We know that Facebook collaborates with governments and help them disable/ban or even disclose IP if requested. So, if one were to use Facebook and still feels the need to get their point across without letting the govt. snoop in behind their backs, then they should consider hiding their identity online (IP). But free and even some paid VPN tools won't help, as they log your IP and activity, so what you would eventually need is a paid VPN which doesn't log your activity. Check wiki of r/privacy for that. Make changes, and adapt before it's too late. The govt. has already completed bio-metric registration of Mobile Network and Personal Internet, your IP is effectively your CNIC every time you go online. This may not be true for public WiFi/university internet, as lots of people are on the same IP, and it would require more effort for them to zero in, but still it won't be a match if state is really after them, as they would use all the tools at their disposal, as was the case with bloggers. Few tweets or restricted Facebook posts shared among friends won't get you on the 'radar'. The problem arises when you take your narrative to the public, and that's when you have to be cautious. Stay safe, Pakistan! "
