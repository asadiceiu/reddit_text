0,CVE,hacking,Learning about Exploitation using VMs. What vulnerabilities should I be implementing?,1,i08qe3,https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/i08qe3/learning_about_exploitation_using_vms_what/,2020-07-30 07:05:10,"Recently, I've been working on a project to learn a little bit about exploitation of vulnerable systems (kind of like vulnhub). Problem is, I want to do it DIY (learn more about configuration / setup this way), but I don't really know what vulnerabilities to implement on a ""victim"" Debian machine that I will ""attack"" with Kali Linux (all in VMs at the moment). What I'm looking for: Vulnerabilities that are seen commonly in real-world production environments. Misconfigurations or bugs in common programs / operating systems. I want to simulate something realistic -- not too vulnerable yet still vulnerable enough to exploit and learn something. That's not necessarily to say that Remote Code Exec and Priv Esc are unwanted; I just want to limit the number of those kinds of vulns to make my attack paths more interesting. In other words, what general kinds of exploits or programs (OpenSMTPD, PHP stuff, etc.) that have historically been pretty vulnerable are there that I can install / configure onto my vulnerability lab and play around with? If applicable, a corresponding CVE would be really helpful too. Shoot me with your recommendations. Thanks all!"

I have a quick question. Older versions of Windows contains a bug in crypt32.dll that allows generating a fake certificates. I have seen some discussions and it seems like the exploit should work also for driver signing. I have tried it myself but it seems like it does not work. I am using an MS root authority cert and sha256 when signing it. &amp;#x200B; URL Did anyone else tried that? What can be the issue? It there any other verification going on that I am missing?

5,CVE,hacking,CVE Recording Conventions,1,g4dlim,https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/g4dlim/cve_recording_conventions/,2020-04-20 05:20:39,"Not sure if this is the correct subreddit to post this question in. I found a few bugs in a popular embedded device, and I am at the point where I am ready to do CVE filings. I think the convention is to file a bug report for every bug there is, but I am not sure if this particular bug should be classified as a bug, or just incompetence from a security standpoint. Without releasing too much detail, one of the bugs has to do with the login procedure. Instead of storing a cookie, the device simply writes a file containing the IP address of the authenticated device. Of course, this is a problem because an attacker can spoof the authenticated computer's MAC address and assume the same IP address. Or perhaps, an attacker found another bug that allows them arbitrary read/write access to the embedded device and is able to overwrite this file with their own IP address. Should I file this particular bug as I start doing the CVEs? What is the threshold for what is classified as a security problem? Should everything  even the smallest vulnerabilities  be filed?"
6,CVE,hacking,Analysis of Microsoft IE Edge Script Engine Vulnerability CVE-2020-0768,1,fjykpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/fjykpe/analysis_of_microsoft_ie_edge_script_engine/,2020-03-17 14:49:17,"**Author: Venus ADLab** **description link:** [**URL 1. In a patch announcement recently released by Microsoft, Microsoft fixed a vulnerability submitted by Celestial ADLab security researchers, and the vulnerability number was CVE-2020-0768. The vulnerability is located in the ChakraCore engine code base and can affect both Internet Explorer 11 and Microsoft Edge (EdgeHTML) browsers. The vulnerability is a memory corruption vulnerability and there is a risk of remote code execution, so Microsoft rated it ""critical"" and thanks ADLab. 2. **Responses** 3. Use Windows automatic updates or manually download the patch package to fix the vulnerabilities. 4. Vulnerability and patch analysis 5. PART 1 6. This vulnerability is a data flow analysis error of a single instruction during the JIT compilation process of the ChakraCore engine, which results in the error activity analysis and register allocation errors. Start with the control flow diagram of the vulnerability sample: 7. &amp;#x200B; URL 1. &amp;#x200B; 2. &amp;#x200B; 3. Among them, the following byte code is in Block 4: 4. &amp;#x200B; URL 1. &amp;#x200B; 2. The symbol s10 stands for \[1337\], and s6 stands for const-modified arr. According to the terms of the principle of compilation, the variable definition value is called def, and the variable value is called use. In the InitConst instruction, s6 is def, s10 is used, and then under the StElemC instruction, s6 is used. It can be seen that s6 is closely related to s10. S6 can be regarded as a reference to the same variable by s10 according to another method. ChakraCore calls the copy-prop symbol a reference to the original symbol. But debugging shows that something went wrong here: 3. &amp;#x200B; 4. &amp;#x200B; URL 1. &amp;#x200B; 2. &amp;#x200B; 3. In this way, a key-value pair of s10 and s6 as the copy-prop symbol is formed, that is, s6-&gt; s10. Its stack trace is located at: 4. &amp;#x200B; 5. &amp;#x200B; 6. &amp;#x200B; URL 1. &amp;#x200B; 2. Error key-value pairs are based on the error results of data flow analysis. Subsequently, this key-value pair was added to blockOptData-&gt; capturedValues-&gt; copyPropSyms in Block 4, and its stack trace is located at: 3. &amp;#x200B; URL 1. Subsequently, in the front-to-back optimization process of JIT ForwardPass, block 4's blockOptData-&gt; capturedValues were merged to Block 5, which contains the key-value pair s6-&gt; s10, and its stack trace is located at: 2. &amp;#x200B; URL 1. &amp;#x200B; 2. Then, in the backward-to-forward optimization process of JIT BackwardPass, the upwardExposedUses of Block 5 accesses blockOptData-&gt; capturedValues-&gt; copyPropSyms and adds the key-value pair s6-&gt; s10. Its stack trace is located at: 3. &amp;#x200B; 4. &amp;#x200B; URL 1. upwardExposedUses is called ""upward exposed use"" in the compilation principle, it is a symmetrical process of variable activity analysis. Subsequently, in the process of backpropagation, upwardExposedUses containing the above key-value pairs are passed to Block 4, Block 3, and Block 2. As a Loop Header, Block 2 uses its upwardExposedUses for activity analysis and subsequent register allocation. 2. &amp;#x200B; 3. &amp;#x200B; URL 1. The above process can be represented by the following figure. It can be seen that the erroneous data undergoes forward and backward propagation, and is eventually contaminated in the entire range of the loop body. 2. &amp;#x200B; 3. &amp;#x200B; URL &amp;#x200B; 1. Subsequently, due to the above-mentioned erroneous data, the erroneous life cycle was calculated for s10 in the register allocation process of the JIT, and its life cycle spanned from the beginning to the end of the cycle. Therefore, the JIT inserts a MOV instruction in the form of MOV labelReg, mem, but does not initialize its instr-&gt; src-&gt; m\_offset, which is always 0. When the machine code was finally generated, a read memory operation pointing to a stack frame pointer with an offset of 0 was generated, which was expressed as \[EBP + 0x0\] or \[RBP + 0x0\]. &amp;#x200B; URL 1. In this way, an unexpected memory access reads illegal data into the context of the JavaScript engine and is then referenced in BailOut or other situations. Such illegal data will cause type confusion. 2. PART 2 3. The reason for the above-mentioned error data transmission is that the InitConst instruction actually did not get the correct data flow analysis in the JIT code of ChakraCore. Therefore, in the Microsoft repair, when the JIT first started to intervene, the InitConst instruction was replaced with the Ld\_A instruction. . 4. &amp;#x200B; URL 1. &amp;#x200B; 2. ChakraCore completely implements the data flow analysis of the Ld\_A instruction. At this time, in the analysis of Forward Pass, it was found that the key-value pair in Block 4 is no longer s6-&gt; s10, but s10-&gt; s6, that is, s10 is the original symbol and s6 is the copy-prop symbol that references s10. In this way, the transmission of erroneous data will naturally not be caused. Microsoft used the same code in IE11 to patch the vulnerability. 3. In fact, in the ECMAScript 6 standard, the const modifier is used to indicate that a variable can no longer be assigned after it is defined, which is a syntax-level constraint; the JIT process in the JavaScript engine always occurs after interpretation and execution. If the const modifier is Constraints are violated during the interpretation execution phase and will immediately exit without optimizing the JIT process. Therefore, the JIT process only needs to consider the data flow problem, not the constraints of the const modifier. Because ChakraCore uses the same set of intermediate languages during the optimization phase of JIT and the execution phase of interpretation, both Ld\_A and InitConst are compatible with the entire process of JIT. This vulnerability can be clearly considered as a business logic vulnerability. 4. **Reference link** 5. [URL 6. [URL"

Only works on Android devices however so if you're on IOS or PC u can't get it. If your on Android however I do encourage downloading it. The German police yesterday raided the house of the developer of OmniRAT and seized his laptop, computer and mobile phones probably as part of an investigation into a recent cyber attack. More Info on : URL Download 'The Geek App Reloaded By Alien Skills' from Google Play. The world's best handbook for Security Experts with 1 Million+ downloads. The German police yesterday raided the house of the developer of OmniRAT and seized his laptop, computer and mobile phones probably as part of an investigation into a recent cyber attack, a source told. OmniRAT made headlines in November 2015 when its developer launched it as a legitimate remote administration tool for IT experts and companies to manage their devices with explicit permissions. Available between $25 and $100, OmniRAT quickly became one of the most popular remote administration tools, allowing users to monitor Android, Windows, Linux, and Mac devices remotely and access every available information on them. However, just like any other remote administration tool like DroidJack, DarkComet, AndroRAT, and njRAT, some customers of OmniRAT also used the tool for illicit purposes, especially because it was available at a far cheaper price than other RATs in the market. In one such event earlier this year, a group of hackers attempted to target several industries by exploiting an old remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2016-7262) in Microsoft Excel that eventually installed OmniRAT on targeted computers. According to a security researcher who reported this incident in January, the attackers used a malformed Excel sheet disguising as a business profile of ""Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC)"" to lure its victims into opening the attachment. Though Kuwait Petroleum Company was not itself targeted by the malware, another anonymous source told that almost two months ago, lawyers representing the oil company started emailing the domain registrar from where the official domain of OmniRAT was registered and demanded them to disclose the identity of the domain owner, citing whois-related GDPR and ICANN rules. The content on the official OmniRAT website has been unavailable since last few days, which has probably been taken down by its developer to prevent its domain registrar from disclosing his identity to the company. The developer of OmniRAT reportedly resides in Germany, but his/her identity is still unknown to the public. At this moment, it's not clear if the raid by German police is linked to the efforts made by Kuwait Oil Company or involves some separate criminal case against him. It's also possible that the German police could be behind the list and identity of all the customers who purchased OmniRAT in the last four years to crack down on cybercriminals abusing the tool. In a similar operation in 2015, law enforcement agencies in several countries raided homes and arrested suspected users of DroidJack smartphone malware. Though creating malware or hacking tool is illegal in Germany, like many other countries, it also depends upon how the tool has been advertised. Because just like penetration testing tools, remote administration tools are also a two-sided sword and can be used for both legal and illegal purposes. In one case, it was reported that two years ago a group of hackers were using OmniRAT to spy on Islamic State (ISIS) members and supporters by distributing its Android version via the popular Telegram messaging app. A disclaimer, as shared below, posted on the official OmniRAT website also said that the tool is not for hacking and that customers are themselves liable for any misuse. ""OmniRAT is created by German authors, and the servers are also located in Germany. Therefore the German law applies for us. OmniRAT is a remote administration tool (rat). It is not  as many believe  a trojan neither made for hacking; therefore, it is not illegal and does not violate the law. The usage, however, is only licit on devices you own or have permission for. This is also stated inside our terms of service. By purchasing and using OmniRAT, you obey the above."" Although the OmniRAT developer did not seem to have directly encouraged his customers to use the tool for spying on someone, late last year, he posted description and new features of his tool on an infamous hacking forum, a website which is famous among newbies for finding hacking tools in the market. On the same hacking forum, in April this year, he announced the shutdown of OmniRAT, saying ""unfortunately due to the pressure of the government and the cybercrime division OmniRAT has to be shut down. This will take immediate effect."" However, since the working of the tool does not directly rely or share collected device data with the OmniRAT server, users who already have access to the remote administration tool can still continue using it for whatever purpose they want."

Dear user of live.co.uk! I am a spyware software developer. Your account has been hacked by me in the summer of 2018. I understand that it is hard to believe, but here is my evidence: - I sent you this email from your account. - Password from account (my email here) Similar password here to the one I've used (on moment of hack). The hacking was carried out using a hardware vulnerability through which you went online (Cisco router, vulnerability CVE-2018-0296). I went around the security system in the router, installed an exploit there. When you went online, my exploit downloaded my malicious code (rootkit) to your device. This is driver software, I constantly updated it, so your antivirus is silent all time. Since then I have been following you (I can connect to your device via the VNC protocol). That is, I can see absolutely everything that you do, view and download your files and any data to yourself. I also have access to the camera on your device, and I periodically take photos and videos with you. At the moment, I have harvested a solid dirt... on you... I saved all your email and chats from your messangers. I also saved the entire history of the sites you visit. I note that it is useless to change the passwords. My malware update passwords from your accounts every times. I know what you like hard funs (adult sites). Oh, yes .. I'm know your secret life, which you are hiding from everyone. Oh my God, what are your like... I saw THIS ... Oh, you dirty naughty person ... :) took photos and videos of your most passionate funs with adult content, and synchronized them in real time with the image of your camera. Believe it turned out very high quality! So, to the business! I'm sure you don't want to show these files and visiting history to all your contacts. Transfer $848 to my Bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet: 1GXazHVQUdJEtpe62UFozFibPa8ToDoUn3 Just copy and paste the wallet number when transferring. If you do not know how to do this - ask Google. My system automatically recognizes the translation. As soon as the specified amount is received, all your data will be destroyed from my server, and the rootkit will be automatically removed from your system. Do not worry, I really will delete everything, since I am 'working' with many people who have fallen into your position. You will only have to inform your provider about the vulnerabilities in the router so that other hackers will not use it. Since opening this letter you have 48 hours. If funds not will be received, after the specified time has elapsed, the disk of your device will be formatted, and from my server will automatically send email and sms to all your contacts with compromising material. I advise you to remain prudent and not engage in nonsense (all files on my server). Good luck! Is this real or not, quite concerned to be honest and don't know what to do. Any help would be appreciated. "

Those experts who specialize in search of vulnerabilities in software code can use the PVS-Studio analyzer for free in their research. This will, in its turn, make our tool more popular if it succeeds in finding vulnerabilities. PVS-Studio can check projects written in C and C++. It all started with the open letter ""[PVS-Studio Team Willing to Work on Improving Tizen Project](URL with which we intended to attract Samsung Electronics' attention. Samsung cares about reliability and security of the Tizen OS and carries out various kinds of research in this area. For example, they [invested](URL over $10 million in Svace static analyzer developed in the Institute for System Programming of the Russian Academy of Science. So, we thought that the Tizen developers would probably find PVS-Studio analyzer useful as well since it managed to detect bugs in their project. After that we were contacted by Amihai Neiderman ([@AAAAAAmihai](URL who showed interest in PVS-Studio's capabilities. Coincidentally, he gave a conference talk about vulnerabilities in the Tizen OS ([Breaking Tizen](URL just a month ago. We exchanged a few emails, and then our company granted Amihai Neiderman a PVS-Studio license to use in his further research of vulnerability detection. It's unknown if he will be lucky to find any issues using our analyzer, but why not give it a try? If he is, then everyone will benefit from it. We gave Amihai Neiderman a new tool capable of detecting suspicious code where vulnerabilities may hide. If he succeeds and finds such issues, it will be a nice opportunity for him to mention PVS-Studio in his next conference talk. And for us it will be a nice opportunity to get additional promotion. It was at this point that a good idea occurred to us. It's strange that it hadn't happen earlier, but that's just the way of many good ideas :). We realized that we should start cooperating with other experts studying vulnerabilities, too. So, if you happen to be a public expert in security and specialize in vulnerability detection, you are welcome to email us to get your PVS-Studio license. We will help you with scanning various projects and provide user support. If you manage to find issues using our tool, we'll appreciate you mentioning it in your articles and talks. Those willing to get the license and support will need to prove that they deal with software security and are engaged in public activity, for example, writing articles. Anyway, these points will be discussed during our communication. If you are interested, please email us at support [@] viva64.com. Far not all PVS-Studio diagnostics detect security related errors. For example, the [V665](URL warning is hardly going to be useful if you look for vulnerabilities. Luckily, such diagnostics can be turned off to leave only relevant warnings. As I already said, you can also count on our support if you have any questions. Note. We haven't positioned our analyzer as a tool for detecting vulnerabilities before. We only discussed regular bugs in our [articles](URL Now we want programmers to view PVS-Studio not only as a tool for detecting typos and other mistakes, but also as a tool that helps prevent multiple vulnerabilities. Many errors detected by PVS-Studio analyzer fall under CWE classification ([example](URL In certain circumstances, CWE issues may turn to CVE ones, so using PVS-Studio allows you not only to eliminate bugs from your code, thus reducing the development cost, but also prevent lots of vulnerabilities.

A lot of spam was sent from his email account and the hosting company said he likely got hacked because he's using an outdated CMS. I'm trying to help him migrate to an updated version of the CMS and get rid of malware, if there is any. But first I need to understand what's going on. How is it possible for the hacker to send spam after hacking the main website? The SMTP server is separate from the main server (smtp.hostingprovider.com), and presumably requires my friend's username and password to the smtp server (basically his Microsoft Outlook login), right? In theory, it should be separate from any passwords used on the website, correct? So the attacker shouldn't have been able to send mail via the SMTP server...? My current best guess is that maybe there was a file on the website that had the SMTP login in it. I remember there was an emailing app on the website once, so maybe the app had the login, so that it could connect to the SMTP server. If that's true, then I should be able to simply ask the hosting provider to change the login of the SMTP and maybe the attacker won't be able to send spam anymore, while I fix the vulnerabilities. Am I correct, or is it not that simple? Edit: It's probably not that simple, is it? He runs a small website making business, and not only his website is compromised, but also his clients' websites are compromised (or at least, they have also been sending spam). I'd like to know how you think the attacker did this. My only guess right now is that maybe there was a list of logins on the main site for every one of his clients. But I don't really know. *** Also, what's the best way of making sure there aren't any shells on the webserver after I upgrade it? I couldn't find any malicious files, but there might still be malicious code somewhere (although, I guess the hacker doesn't really need a shell on the website. He could have just connected directly to the SMTP server through his own computer, right?). For example, [this exploit](URL would have left the exploit code inside the Joomla database, if I've understood correctly. Any help would be greatly appreciated. This is my first attempt at being a sysadmin :)"
