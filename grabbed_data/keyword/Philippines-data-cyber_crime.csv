The [site is thought to be non-biased and highly factual](URL though. **Philippines: COVID-19 Tightens Dutertes Iron Grip  Analysis** June 19, 2020 By [Dr. Imelda Deinla](URL On top of its health impact, COVID-19 has thrown the Philippines further into economic and political uncertainty. The government under President Rodrigo Duterte is demonstrating to the world yet again that a forceful exercise of power is its preferred mode of governance. Yet despite harsh quarantine measures, the Philippines continues to struggle to contain the spread of the virus. The Philippines has one of the highest infection rates in Southeast Asia with 26,420 infections as of 15 June. As restrictions were lifted and businesses reopened on 1 June, the country is awakening to 2.6 million job losses, a figure that could reach up to 10 million by the end of the year. The governments initial response to its first case in January 2020 was to dismiss the severity of the virus. After the first cases of community transmission were recorded in the first week of March, Duterte responded with an enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) order. Some high-risk areas followed the ECQ while other provinces adopted a more moderate approach. The ECQ is a total lockdown prohibiting the movement of people except for the most essential services and necessities. Temporary emergency power was granted to the executive through the Bayanihan Heal as One Act. This allowed officials to implement urgent healthcare measures and provide social safety nets to decrease the economic impact of the lockdown. The Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) was created to implement the Act. It is composed of military personnel with little experience in dealing with health crises. COVID-19 has also amplified existing social cleavages and the lack of political consensus among ruling elites. The political leadership has done little to bridge this gap and forge unity. Dutertes political agenda is centred on cementing his grip on power. This has been done through a command and control, securitised and threat-heavy approach to governance. The pandemic has also presented an opportunity to further erode free and independent press with the recent closure of ABSCBN, the countrys largest television network. This was followed by the conviction for cyber libel of journalist Maria Ressa, a known critic of Duterte. The implementation of the lockdown has disproportionately impacted the poor and vulnerable. Millions of Filipinos are struggling to feed themselves and their families, are unable to work or have been left stranded in places outside of their homes. As dissent on social media and street protests in Manila grow, the government has started to arrest online critics as well as environmental and human rights activists. Vice President Leni Robredo was threatened by a commissioner of the Presidential Anti-Crime Commission with an investigation for allegedly competing with the governments response strategy. Duterte later repudiated this move and fired the commissioner. Local governments have been threatened with legal cases and sanctions if they do not get case numbers under control. But they are also censured and threatened with investigations if they implement effective policies as in the case of popular Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto. The Philippine National Police prided itself on low crime rates during the lockdown and the arrest of over 17,000 ECQ violators. This further compounds the problem of overcrowded jails which have become epicentres of the virus. The COVID-19 crisis further exposes the progressive weakening of institutions, particularly rule of law institutions. This is partly the result of an institutional leadership unable to stand up to discretionary power, which is being excused from accountability and is standing above the law. While thousands have been arrested even for minor infractions, senior officials close to the administration flouting quarantine regulations have been dismissed or treated with compassion. After the Philippines emerges from the pandemic, effective institutions will be essential for economic recovery and business confidence. Around eight business groups have issued a joint public statement pointing to a lack of clarity on lockdown rules and denouncing brazen violations by public officials. Five business groups have again issued a joint statement expressing deep concern over Ressas conviction noting serious constitutional questions involved in the case. Filipinos have cited inefficiencies in the delivery of transport services and distribution of the social amelioration package. They have little trust in the frontline agency, the Department of Health, doubting the accuracy of its data. The economic turnaround for the Philippines post-Marcos ensured greater political stability and neo-liberal economic reforms forged through a democratic social compact. Despite delivering strong growth, these developments failed to distribute wealth equitably and alleviate poverty. Duterte is using an illiberal model hoping that it delivers the same or better economic outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic is testing his regime. The increasing dissatisfaction among his support base regarding his handling of the crisis may not erode Dutertes popularity in the short term. If it does, Duterte may use more draconian measures to maintain control. What is clear is that there is no categorical buy-in for most of the governments flagship economic and political programs being pushed out to solve the issues generated by the pandemic  including a second tax reform package, the anti-terror bill and constitutional amendment. The pandemic has shown that Philippine dissenters and civil society will not give up their freedom and right to demand accountable government. *About the author: Imelda Deinla is Director of the Philippines Project and a fellow in the School of Regulation and Global Governance (RegNet), The Australian National University (ANU).

1,cyber crime,Philippines,"Teacher, son arrested without warrant in GenSan over Facebook post",1,fqbif6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/fqbif6/teacher_son_arrested_without_warrant_in_gensan/,2020-03-28 13:26:53,"[Source.](URL Frustrated that people are going hungry amid a lockdown in her city, a public school teacher vents on Facebook. She faces charges of inciting to sedition. GENERAL SANTOS CITY, Philippines  A teacher and her son of legal age were arrested without warrants here on Friday night, March 27, over what local officials tagged as a ""provoking"" Facebook post, and face charges of inciting to sedition and disobedience to authority, respectively. As General Santos City was under enhanced community quarantine to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a Facebook user vented that people were going hungry and encouraged people to raid a local gym where food meant for them were supposedly stocked. A Facebook account using the name Yet Rodriguez Enosencio posted: ""Maraming mamamatay sa gutom if hindi tayo magtutulong-tulong na magreport sa Pangulo na inutil ang ating Mayor.... Panawagan sa walang makain, sugurin 'nyo na nang sabay-sabay ang Lagao Gym. Nakatambak doon ang pagkaing para sa inyo."" (Many people will die if we don't report to the President that our mayor is incompetent. I call on those who have nothing to eat to raid the Lagao Gym. The food packs meant for you are piled up there.) 'Continuing crime' Upon the complaint of the City Government's Legal Office, the Philippine National Police (PNP) Region 12 Cybercrime Unit hunted down the Facebook user and arrested the person behind it, Juliet Espinosa, a 55-year-old public school teacher. Cops arrested Espinosa even without a warrant, saying that because the post was still live on Facebook, it will count as a continuing crime. This follows an earlier ruling by the Department of Justice (DOJ) that upheld as valid the warrantless arrest of web administrator Rodel Jayme for helping upload the Bikoy ""Ang Totoong Narcolist"" videos. Like Jayme, Espinosa faces charges of violation of Article 142 of the Revised Penal Code or Inciting to Sedition. Dahil diyan, inaresto namin siya kasi this a continuing crime  patuloy siya na nangyayari  kasi during that time pumunta si Atty Clarin sa office namin, it was about 4 oclock in the afternoon, present pa 'yung post na 'to, hindi pa 'to deleted said Police Major Leo Dofelis, Assistant Chief of the regional cybercrime unit. (We arrested her because this is a continuing crime  it's still happening  because when Atty Clarin went to our office at about 4 pm this afternoon, the post is still there, it's not been deleted.) Dofelis was referring to Arman Clarin, General Santos City's Legal Officer. Inciting to sedition is defined as ""seditious words or speeches, write, publish, or circulate scurrilous libels against the Republic of the Philippines or any of the duly constituted authorities thereof, or which tend to disturb or obstruct any lawful officer in executing the functions of his office, or which tend to instigate others to cabal and meet together for unlawful purposes, or which suggest or incite people against the lawful authorities or to disturb the peace of the community, the safety and order of the Government, or who shall knowingly conceal such evil practices."" Son arrested too Espinosa's son, of legal age, was also arrested for trying to stop the cops from taking his mother. The son will face charges of violation of Article 151 or resistance or disobedience to a person of authority. ""Later on we might press an additional charge of obstruction of justice against him,"" Dofelis said in Filipino. The mother and son were in jail, and would undergo inquest proceedings on Monday, March 30. Courts and prosecutors' offices are physically closed nationwide, but judges and officers will go to work for an urgent matter like bail. Both inciting to sedition and disobedience to authority are bailable. Liability of those who shared ""Her case is also in relation to RA 10175 or the cybercrime law,"" Dofelis said in Filipino. Dofelis said they will study the criminal liability of those who shared Espinosa's post. The Supreme Court has already declared as unconstitutional the provision of the Cybercrime Prevention Act that punishes ""aiding and abetting"" in a case of cyber libel. The newly-passed Bayanihan To Heal As One Act, which gives special powers to President Rodrigo Duterte, penalizes ""individuals or groups creating, perpetuating, or spreading false information regarding the COVID-19 crisis on social media and other platforms."" ""Isang post mo lang na mali especially sa COVID-19 issue, baka maka-cause ng panic o baka ma-misinterpret ng iba at mag-encourage pa na gumawa nang hindi maganda,"" said Dofelis. (One wrong post you make especially on the COVID-10 issue may cause panic, or may be misinterpreted and may encourage others to break the law.) The DOJ had earlier said that warrantless arrest can be implemented against lockdown violators who will be caught in the act, no matter if they resist arrest or not.  Rappler.com"

And I personally don't agree that there should be one. Nor do I believe that it should be an important criteria for a voter. A higher education doesn't necessarily equate to competency, integrity, or political willingness. Nor can we categorically prove previous lawmakers with higher education are more competent, have more integrity and political will than less educated lawmakers; simply because the barriers to entry for good-intentioned nobodies are so high (machinery and money), only a certain kind of less educated candidates (celebrities) have won nationally. Politicians, especially from families who have made politics their careers, can buy diplomas to help their image. - I'm not really sure if this assumption is correct: in the senate website, the principal author (the senator who filed first in case of multilple versions) of the bill is named first. I initially only labeled Binay as the principal author when the legilative history indicates she introduced the bill. - Because she approved mostexcept for one where she wasn't able to cast a votelegislation of national importance, I scrapped that part.

Feel free to point it out as well as any improvement that can be made. :) ---- **Notes:** [1] Archived Committee Membership for the 16th Congress isn't available at senate.gov.ph. Retrieved from [wikipedia edit history](URL [2] SBN = Senate Bill Number [3] [Search results filter](URL Author = Binay + Legislative status = Consolidated with Approved Bill [4] Only resolutions where Binay is the lone author excluding congratulatory, commemoratory, or condolatory resolutions. For brevity, not all requests for inquries are included. **Data Sources:** URL and relevant news articles **Other Notes:** - I didn't include educational attainment because it's not a requirement under current laws. And I personally don't agree that there should be one. Nor do I believe that it should be an important criteria for a voter. A higher education doesn't necessarily equate to competency, integrity, or political willingness. Nor can we categorically prove previous lawmakers with higher education are more competent, have more integrity and political will than less educated lawmakers; simply because the barriers to entry for good-intentioned nobodies are so high (machinery and money), only a certain kind of less educated candidates (celebrities) have won nationally. Politicians, especially from families who have made politics their careers, can buy diplomas to help their image. - I'm not really sure if this assumption is correct: in the senate website, the principal author (the senator who filed first in case of multilple versions) of the bill is named first. I initially only labeled Binay as the principal author when the legilative history indicates she introduced the bill. - Because she voted yes to mostexcept for one where she didn't cast a votebills ""of national importance"" approved by the president, I scrapped that part. Here's [the link](URL if you want to see the summary of her votes and roles on important laws passed in the 16th and 17th Congress. ^([Edit History:]) ^() ^([Sorry kung ang advance ko mag-isip.

This has been going on for more.than a year and its starting to piss me off that we couldnt do anything to make the people behind this pay.

7,cyber crime,Philippines,"Rappler, Duterte, and Responsible Journalism",11,4aahsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/4aahsd/rappler_duterte_and_responsible_journalism/,2016-03-14 10:03:14,"URL &gt; Rappler 17 hrs  &gt;""During the question and answer portion, Rody Duterte's responses are long and winding as one student points out."" #PHVote One of our readers, a student, was attacked by netizens who claim to be supporters of presidential candidate Rodrigo Duterte because our video report allowed them to assume he was the student who questioned Duterte. When he brought it to our attention, we re-edited the video to remove his video cutaway. &gt;We apologize for the circumstances this created for him. Since then, netizens scoured the web, found and attacked the student who actually asked Duterte the question. They've gone beyond harassment, issued threats, and many are breaking the law. &gt;No one deserves to be bullied for exercising their freedom to speak in a public forum. We condemn the witch hunt, bullying, and threats that the students are being subjected to. While supporters may have different views and opinions from one another, no one deserves to have their life and security threatened. Instead, we would like to encourage supporters of all the candidates to focus on issues instead of resorting to low blows like bullying and threatening another human being which is a crime. So I recently came upon the article about that UPLB student and yes, I am a little late to the party but this is not about that. This is about Rappler and irresponsible journalism. We all know that Filipino Netizens (heh.) love to jump the gun, and we all know that the student who was in the video is now receiving death threats and is being cyber bullied but it looks like, prior to being identified, these netizens (heh. again) we able to identify another student and mistook said student to be the one in the video because of the video that Rappler posted. URL Turns out Rappler, God's gift to Journalism, edited the video in a way that it still had identifiers to the student. This was raised to their attention only AFTER they posted it, (I mean fuck processes right?) and have since re-edited the video (which took a day) while also issuing a half-assed apology, more of a cop out really. &gt;""Hey, we are sorry we were irresponsible and basically fed you to the wolves BUT notice how these madmen from the internet are terrible, have you seen their comments? I'd hate for me to be in their crosshairs! I am in no way saying that what the Du-pporters (actually saw a person refer to themselves as that at the comments section) did is correct, far from it but this is about accountability. Now, Let's play what if? What if one of them was Crazy enough to push through with the threats? Would Rappler, where Facts and Opinions have no line, even flinch? **TL;DR:Rappler posts video of UPLB student, Student was falsely identified as the one asking Duterte in the video and gets the Top Gear Treatment (Patent Pending).** And I know mainstream media isn't exactly the best here, amirite?

One of your citizens has, for now, stolen from me. I have given them money to send a digital good however after numerous delays they have not done so. The person has refused to address the issue which I am contemplating on reporting to numerous bodies. Such as the Philippines Police. I know the full name of the person and where they go to school, and place of residence (Manila). However I'm unfamiliar with the justice system in the Philippines, and I'm not sure who to contact. It suggest that I phone their Criminal Investigation &amp; Detection Group For Cyber Crime / Computer Related Crimes? Any assistance with this matter would be greatly appreciated. URL"
