9,CVE,synology,To the mods: Can we PLEASE get a sticky post or a proper sidebar notice that you should NOT expose your Synology device directly to the internet?,48,cdeb63,https://www.reddit.com/r/synology/comments/cdeb63/to_the_mods_can_we_please_get_a_sticky_post_or_a/,2019-07-15 17:16:07,"/u/Kryten107 and /u/tsdguy People are wondering how they can share files, photos, or media over the internet. Or they want to be able to log in to DSM from the internet. Or even want to use installed packages such as Surveillance Station over the internet. Some want to have SMB access over the internet (!). There needs to be a proper and highly visible warning with a simple ""**DON'T**"". Just as recent as yesterday, someone did a post here wondering how (why) their Syno box was infected with ransomware, and it turned out it was exposed to the internet. With the guest account enabled... The majority of people simply do not understand the risks of exposing your Synology's services to the public. They think just because they have a ""good"" password - or 2-factor-authetication enabled - that they aren't exposing themselves to unnecessary risk. Or some even believe because they haven't told anyone about their IP number it will be hidden and no-one will discover it. Even though Synology Inc. developers are [decent at fixing security holes](URL we can never be fully 100% sure that there aren't more unknown security holes waiting to be exploited. And for various reasons (laziness, ignorance, technical reasons, etc), a lot of users do not patch/upgrade their DSM often enough for these security issues to be fixed on their systems. An example: there have been several security issues in the past where you could remotely execute code as root user - without a password - over the internet. [CVE-2015-6912](URL and [CVE-2013-6955](URL In one of those all that was needed was for you to expose the DSM user login page to the internet. The remote attacker didn't even have to access the DSM login page itself to get access. For those that don't know, the linux ""root"" user is comparable with the ""Administrator"" user on a window system. It has full access to do whatever it wants. Another factor to consider is that even though Synology Inc. are working hard on their own code to ensure it's as safe as possible, they have implemented a lot of 3rd party software and features in their devices. This is code they have no control over. And sometimes there are security issues with this code. Whoever is responsible for the 3rd party code needs to provide a fix before Synology can implement it into their next patch. So as a final note, how do you ensure secure access to your Syno box outside your own LAN? [You use a VPN server](URL Period. Anything else beyond that is simply ~~ignorance~~ stupidity. I'm sure people have lot of suggestions on how to secure a Syno box, such as simply using a white list in its firewall. But no. Don't. Use a VPN. It's like locking your safe, but leaving your home front door open. Would you put your Windows or Apple computer directly on the internet without having a firewall enabled in your router? Many don't realize that a NAS is a computer. It's not some small gadget that can do networky things. Script kiddies and automated bots are probing your IP address 24/7 (yes, literally) waiting for a hole to exploit. What happens if you forget or misconfigure your white list? In my opinion, the DSM firewall is only suitable for LAN use, i.e. on large enterprise network environments. What are you thoughts on this?"
