1,CVE,PFSENSE,FreeBSD privilege escalation x2 - does it affect pfsense?,1,ema2gc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PFSENSE/comments/ema2gc/freebsd_privilege_escalation_x2_does_it_affect/,2020-01-10 01:05:00,"RECENT VULNERABILITIES FOR WHICH EXPLOITS ARE AVAILABLE COMPILED BY THE QUALYS VULNERABILITY RESEARCH TEAM This is a list of recent vulnerabilities for which exploits are available. System administrators can use this list to help in prioritization of their remediation activities. The Qualys Vulnerability Research Team compiles this information based on various exploit frameworks, exploit databases, exploit kits and monitoring of internet activity. ID: CVE-2019-16278 Title: Nostromo Web Server Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Vendor: Nazgul Description: A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Nostromo Web Server. This issue is caused by a directory traversal in the function http_verify in nostromo nhttpd allowing an attacker to achieve remote code execution via a crafted HTTP request. After successful exploitation of this vulnerability an attacker can achieve remote code execution via a crafted HTTP request. CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) ID: CVE-2019-5596 Title: FreeBSD Privilege Escalation Vulnerability Vendor: FreeBSD Description: In FreeBSD, a bug in the reference count implementation for UNIX domain sockets can cause a file structure to be incorrectly released potentially allowing a malicious local user to gain root privileges or escape from a jail. FreeBSD attempts to handle the case where the receiving process does not provide a sufficiently large buffer for an incoming control message containing rights. The code which performs this operation failed to release a reference obtained on the file corresponding to a received right. This bug can be used to cause the reference counter to wrap around and free the file structure. CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.2 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) ID: CVE-2019-1405 Title: Microsoft UPnP Local Privilege Elevation Vulnerability Vendor: Microsoft Description: An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows Universal Plug and Play service improperly allows COM object creation. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with elevated system privileges. CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.2 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) ID: CVE-2019-19726 Title: OpenBSD Dynamic Loader chpass Privilege Escalation Vulnerability Vendor: Pulse Secure Description: Qualys discovered a local privilege escalation in OpenBSD's dynamic loader (ld.so). This vulnerability is exploitable in the default installation (via the set-user-ID executable chpass or passwd) and yields full root privileges. OpenBSD allows local users to escalate to root because a check for LD_LIBRARY_PATH in setuid programs can be defeated by setting a very small RLIMIT_DATA resource limit. When executing chpass or passwd (which are setuid root), _dl_setup_env in ld.so tries to strip LD_LIBRARY_PATH from the environment, but fails when it cannot allocate memory. Thus, the attacker is able to execute their own library code as root. CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.2 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) ID: CVE-2019-1184 Title: Windows Shell COM Server Registrar Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability Vendor: Microsoft Description: An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Windows Core Shell COM Server Registrar improperly handles COM calls. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could potentially set certain items to run at a higher level and thereby elevate permissions. CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.2 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) ID: CVE-2019-19844 Title: Django count Hijack Vulnerability Vendor: Django Description: Django allows account takeover. A suitably crafted email address (that is equal to an existing user's email address after case transformation of Unicode characters) would allow an attacker to be sent a password reset token for the matched user account. Django's password-reset form uses a case-insensitive query to retrieve accounts matching the email address requesting the password reset. CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)"
2,CVE,PFSENSE,VPN Vulnerability,0,e8ug5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/PFSENSE/comments/e8ug5r/vpn_vulnerability/,2019-12-11 05:23:54,"I ran across CVE-2019-14899, which says that a vpn connection could be hijacked. OpenVPN came out with an advisory that says it's not OpenVPN related, but how the issue affects all network interfaces in linux, unix, freebsd, openbsd, etc. The advisory at OpenVPN says to enable the 'reverse path filter' as a step to help protect against it. I was wondering if pfsense is vulnerable to this and if there's anything that can be done to protect it. It sounds like the referse path filter is something only on linux and not bsd. Here's some additional information about it: URL URL URL URL"

BLUF: Should I buy a consumer AP or spend the money to add AP capability to a pfsense box I built? The box has a quad core AMD CPU and 8 GB RAM, and I haven't added any bells and whistles other than pfblocker. Background: I used to use a Netgear R6100. That model has a checkbox for WPS that doesn't actually allow you to turn off WPS. My neighbor brute forced the pin (reaver?) and then with a special GET request (I'm not even looking up the CVE) escalated on the Netgear. From there he compromised my entire network, putting backdoors in everything. My response was to build a pfsense box which is the firewall and router for my home, and then I put that same R6100 (now running openwrt) in its own subnet, dropping everything not bound for the internet. That R6100 is now giving up on me. I figure if I want reliable, fast wifi throughout my 2000 square foot ranch I can either spend over $100 dollars on a nice consumer AP, or put a PCIE WiFi card into the pfsense box for about the same price.
