The main reason I'm posting this story is because I want to figure out what really happened. I still have the system logs, network activity, Slack conversations, and several screenshots from the night I mention. I don't know how much of it is actually relevant, but if there's something in there that someone with iOS or network security can decipher, I would want to talk to them, if only for my own sanity. There are things that happened here that are my own fault, and due to my technical naivety. I'm just looking for advice on what my options are and to understand the situation, not a reprimand for the poor decision-making. About 2 years ago, I was working at a media/tech company under the umbrella of a major sports league when this happened. The league's tech side (~2000 people) acquired the software company I worked at (~50 people) in fall 2015. This was my first job right after college in summer 2015 and I was officially hired as the merger was announced. I work in UI design, and my software and IT knowledge was lacking at the time. I was bringing my personal macbook to the office, and doing most of my work through there for a few months. After the company was acquired, I continued to do so. My work laptop was several years old and too slow for Adobe software that I was using daily. When an employee on my team left, I acquired their newer macbook after the IT guy wiped it, and from that point was using both my work and personal macbooks at the office, taking just my personal one home with me each day. Around late spring of 2016, I started noticing unusual behavior on my work laptop. Recent searches appearing that I never typed, new Spotlight search recommendations like Activity Monitor and Network tools, apps accessed that I never use, files opened that I rarely access, settings changing. One example is with the Dropbox app - my personal account was connected to my work computer, and I noticed my selective sync settings kept changing to sync my personal folders, which I explicitly made sure to exclude. I became more and more suspicious as time went on and thought somebody within the company was accessing my machine remotely. I ended up staying late one Friday night to try to 'fix' it. I thought changing my work computer permissions would stop it, and surprise, it stopped working after that genius idea. I still had my personal computer with me, which I started using at that point. I pinged a coworker on Slack who confirmed that the company does indeed have remote access to our machines through Meraki, and that he uses Little Snitch to block access. He sent me the link to it and I downloaded it. He suggested I boot the work laptop into single user mode to fix those permissions and sent some links to help. At this point, it's 9pm and there's a dev who's also staying late. I tell him what's going on with the permissions and all and he sends me other links, and tells me to run those commands to fix it. None of them work or really change anything. I attempt to call our company 24/7 IT support but it strangely goes to voicemail. I message a few more people on Hipchat, but no one can really help. Eventually, I drive directly home. Once I get home, I see this Little Snitch tool constantly pinging me on my personal machine, but can't recall what the notifications said said. I changed some of the settings, which must have opened some kind of network portal into my machine. This is when it starts getting scary. As I attempt to revert the settings, I can see them actively change back and lock, as if I didn't do anything. I keep trying to change this with no luck. Windows start popping on my screen for system settings and I hear that apple lock sound open, which I quickly try to counteract. Essentially, I go into panic mode and start defending my computer against all these attacks which are happening every second. Notifications that looked inauthentic and almost like a fake Apple UI with blurry icons keep popping up requesting my password, which I try to exit from. At some point in the night, I booted into recovery mode (if I recall correctly) and saw what looked like another drive, or connection, something I don't understand that was connected to my computer. I could see what they were doing and saw that they were looking through photos in my Dropbox folder. I realized I could look into their directory as well, and the only folder I was able to see before they disconnected was called Power Management. I can't remember all the details of that night, but it ended with me locking myself out of my own machine when creating a Firmware password, and recall the UI there also looked fake. The password I setup wasn't working. I doubt the security of my home network after all this and was worried about access to private information like bank/email passwords, family info, etc. When I called Apple after the Firmware lockout, they asked me if my operating system was bootleg, and doubted the authenticity of my operating system. I end up taking it to the Apple store that day. What I'm wondering about at this point is, is there a possibility that my experience at home with the obvious remote connection is due to something that happened at work via the network? But here is the real part of the story. I got in the office late that following Monday and was really distraught after messing up both my work and personal computers. The IT guy gave me a loaner machine to use in the meantime and wasn't happy that I took the computer to the Apple store. I am still seeing the activity I saw on my original work machine that prompted my suspicion like recommended Spotlight searches of network activity files and Activity Monitor that never came up in the past (Is it possible this could be done intentionally to make me paranoid?). I end up looking into system logs and console activity and not really understanding what I'm looking at, but I decide to save it all anyway. It starts getting really late at this point, like 2 am and I am there alone. And this is the really fucked up part and I know wasn't just an effect of my paranoia, which I'll get to later. I start to hear noises throughout the office. Two women talking to each other like they're having a conversation. They're whispering to each other, and I can't make out what they're actually saying, but it's loud enough that I can hear them. I start walking around the office trying to find where it's coming from but I can't find them anywhere. I walk around but can't find anyone and it gets silent as soon as I start looking. I try to open some office doors, but some of them are locked. I go back to my desk and continue to save logs. I realize this isn't just management remotely monitoring employees -- there is someone actively mirroring my display and viewing my screen via an Apple TV and various other connected devices. At just the right moment, I'm able to change settings and view their screen, seeing their desktop. It quickly goes back to my screen as they disconnect. I also realize there's a remote connection via a Mac Mini, and I somehow am able to view their widgets screen, and suspect my department head because a lot of the widgets are in his native language. There are other moments where I continue to hear people's voices. At 4am, I hear someone in a locked office go ""What?!"" and then the sound of someone walking a bike, and an exit door close (Looking back, I wonder how I could have heard this so clearly because it was the former CEO's office and is pretty much sound-proof). I also hear the sound of doors closing across the office by the kitchen, but when I go there there is no one there. If you saw the office camera, I would look like some paranoid lunatic running around empty rooms. When I go to the bathroom at one point, I hear two guys talking to each other in the men's bathroom, and in my head I figure that's where they're been hiding. As I walk back to my desk, I see one of the employees walking outside in the distance, the same guy who sent me those links on how to change back my user permissions a few nights ago. At this point it's 7am and the receptionist is making coffee. I start to hear their voices again coming from an office near the main door, and I know I'll catch them this time. As I walk towards this office, the receptionist enters through the main door, and is walking towards me in the opposite direction. And that's when I hear the laughter, very loudly and clearly, positively from that office I'm about to walk into. As I hear the laughter, the receptionist and I both look at each other and I say explicitly, ""You heard that, right?"" and she confirms that she did. When I look into the office, there's no one there. I go back to my desk and see the first dev arrive. He sees that I look very paranoid and freaked out by everything, and it didn't help that I stayed there all night. When I walk away from his area, I hear the first voices I heard of the women. This time, I can clearly hear her say, ""Is she gone?"" and when I go back to his area, I see him standing over an empty desk responding to the voice as if there was someone there. It's only much later on that I realized that all of these voices and sounds were probably transmitted over a speaker of some kind as a sick prank. There is much more that happened afterwards regarding HR, an attempt to escalate the issue, a leave of absence, and non-stop verbal harassment when I returned until I had no choice but to quit. All of this raises some very disturbing questions... although companies are legally allowed to monitor your activity, when does it become a crime? At what point does it become an invasion of privacy and malicious behavior? And does all that change when you're talking about a personal computer? Where do you draw the line? I'm not sure if this is the proper subreddit for this story, and looking for all the help I can get, so I'll be posting to similar channels as well. TLDR: While working at my former job, I experienced remote monitoring on my computer, that led to paranoia and harassment when attempting to escalate the issue. I saved log files and online conversations and want to understand what happened and who I can talk to about this."
1,cyber-crime,cyberlaws,IMPORTANT: COULD SAVE YOU OR A FRIEND FROM A VERY BAD SITUATION!!!,0,443hzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberlaws/comments/443hzu/important_could_save_you_or_a_friend_from_a_very/,2016-02-04 14:18:49,"Ok. We all know what sexting is. It is the messaging of inappropriate images or texts. We will be talking about the consequences of sending or possessing nude photos of a minor. 1: If you receive a nude photo, it is most likely from a close friend (boyfriend/girlfriend). You don't want to get them in a ton of trouble right! Right. The best thing to do is delete the photo immediately and tell them the consequences of sending nude photos. You might want to tell a parent or teacher, but chances are the will overreact and destroy the future of you/your friend/themselves/alloftheabove. 2. If you send a nude photo, don't panic. You should ask the person you sent it to if they will immediately delete this image. If anyone else finds out, the person who sent it can be charged with creation/distribution of child pornography. The person who has the picture can be charged with possession of child pornography, and if you show a teacher and that teacher shows another teacher, they will most likely both be fired and put in jail or fined. 3. If a friend and another friend have a relationship that involves sexting, inform them IMMEDIATELY that it is illegal. According to the laws in the United States, possession of, distribution of, and creation of child pornography is a felony. The minimum time spent in jail/prison for committing this crime is 5 years. 5 years no one will get back. 4. Finally, if you see this kind of picture of a minor on instagram, or other social medias, they can be charged with distribution of child pornography AND/OR cyber bullying. These are both felonies. Ask them to immediately take the photo down and to refrain from posting any photos like it again. 5. Many 10-30% of students admit to have being sent a nude photo from a minor. Many students who have sent photos have been humiliated online, and ended up hurting themselves, have destroyed job opportunity's, having scholarships revoked, and have even killed themselves. So please, be careful while handling situations like this. The entire point is to minimize the amount of victims and minimize the punishment. Thank You."
