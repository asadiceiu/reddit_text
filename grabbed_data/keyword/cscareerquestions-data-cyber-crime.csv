To start with, I'm a junior majoring in Computer Science. Growing up I was ""addicted"" to anything related to a computer. Taking them apart and putting them back together, learning how hardware/software works, yada yada. So I, along with everyone that knows me personally, knew a CS degree would be perfect to pursue. &amp;#x200B; The thing is, I don't have a passion for programming. What I HAVE always had a passion for is computer forensics, cybersecurity/crime, anything along those lines, especially with the dream of working for a government agency. My school doesn't offer a degree in computer security, forensics, etc. and I cannot minor in IT with my CS major. However, I am enrolled in ""Certification in Computer Security"" but that doesn't really include any classes that'll help in terms of education in that department. Additionally, I went to tech school prior to college for computer networking, security, and repair. &amp;#x200B; So my question is, did I mess up by pursuing CS? I'm already past the point of a major change, but I'm still considering adding on a criminal justice minor, mainly because I believe I'd enjoy those classes but also because I think it'd help towards my future goals. Should I look into one of those ""Cyber Security Certification"" programs after I graduate, or is my CS degree helpful enough to get my foot in the door, at the very least? Any advice is helpful, really. Thank you!"

Hi, so to preface, I am a HS rising senior. I have always been very interested in computers, the internet, and coding. I took a few CS/programming classes at school and I do very well. I thought for sure I wanted to major in computer science in college, but now thinking about where *exactly* i want to go in life, I have some conflicting ideas, and I need advice on what path I should take in college. I dont know if this would be a cybersecurity analyst or something else, but my dream job is tracking down cyber attacks or illicit behavior happening over the internet, specifically international crime. I am not really interested in becoming a software developer (i like coding, but its not my main interest). So my question is, what should I do in college? I understand that if I want a job in the field of cybersecurity, I must first have a strong background in computer science. Should I do CS major, cybersecurity minor? Vice versa? Double major? I would really appreciate some insight on my situation."

4,cyber-crime,cscareerquestions,When to disclose a cyber crime criminal record?,13,asighc,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/asighc/when_to_disclose_a_cyber_crime_criminal_record/,2019-02-20 12:59:53," Some background on me: I have a misdemeanor B for attempted computer crimes from three years ago. I'm able to get it expunged in a year. Since then, I've had two internships at solid tech companies, a few on campus jobs in college and a year experience as a software engineer at a unicorn. I've had two offers rescinded (one being from another big (2+2), but it was for an internship 2 years ago) in the past because of this record, but obviously I've had several others be okay with it, so it's pretty much a crapshoot. In two days I have a final round with a big (2+2) for a software engineering position. When should I disclose my record to maximize my chances of being able to work there? I'm fairly confident that I'll pass the technical portion, so this is really the only thing holding me back. Should I tell the hiring manager straight up during the i n t e r v i e w, should I tell the recruiter after I (potentially) get the offer?"

I voluntarily confessed to it, but I still got a criminal record. So far, its caused some problems with job offers. It caused offers from big A (internship), Palantir (FT) and one mid-sized tech company (FT) to be rescinded. I fortunately had backup offers for all of these which worked out. I lucked out though and am currently working (FT) at a unicorn who was okay with it. Now my current dilemma: Ive had recruiters from big F/G reach out to me and ask me to interview again. I scheduled them tentatively for early next year to give me adequate time to study leetcode again. Should I even bother going through with the interviews? Is it likely that they also would rescind any offers I get? I can get my record expunged in 2 years, so it would be safe to interview then, but I want to get in to big F/G ASAP."

I already have my associate's in the same field with a focus in homeland security/counter-terrorism. Originally I had hopes to be a federal probation/parole officer, but that fell through when, due to an eye condition, I was A) disqualified from that position entirely and B) unable to even get a driver's license. I've been tossing around different ideas for work once I graduate. Obviously I'm gonna be starting somewhere very low on the totem pole, probably something like data entry, police support specialist, etc etc. At the moment I don't have any CS credits or classes to my name, mostly just knowledge I've picked up from browsing the internet all these years so very, VERY far from an expert. Despite the fact I'm pretty much ineligible for any sort of ""field"" work I'd still love to continue working in the criminal justice field. I absolutely love it and don't want to see six years of hard work tossed away just to go work at a call-center or something like that. If it helps, here are some classes I've taken that *might* be relevant or give you an idea of what I've studied: - Weapons of Mass Destruction (types, history, use, deterrents, reaction, etc) - Counter-Terrorism Operations and Tactics - Global Terrorism Studies - Local, State, and Federal Infrastructure - Criminal Law - Police Procedures - Community Policing - Disaster Response and Management - A number of related criminal justice/homeland security classes along with the usual math, english, science, etc. I know none of these really help in terms of potentially going after a career in cyber security or forensics, but up until recently I had been expecting to be doing something very different. My current plan is to graduate with my bachelor's, find work to save up money/build my resume, and then go back to school and get another associate's in something like computer science. I did manage to speak with a guy who worked for the cyber crime division of our state's DCI (Department of Criminal Investigations) and what he told me about the work seemed very interesting, and like something I would love to do. He had also started as a CJ major which was encouraging. So what are some specific jobs in this field I could start looking at and preparing for in the future? As I said, it's most likely going to be a number of years before I can even start getting my foot in the door in this sort of field, considering my lack of experience and training, but I really want to try. I've never even written a line of code in my life but after doing some research on my own it seemed like a very interesting and rewarding career option. And what sorts of things could I study on my own outside of school to better prepare? Thank you! "

I'm a practicing attorney with a focus on civil litigation (mostly IP - both hard and soft, but also some cyber investigation work). I'm fairly new in the field and I am paid well but I don't think I am as happy as I could be. The best part of my job is tracking bad people down online: coming up with an investigation plan, issuing subpoenas, digging through complicated layers of digital evidence and just generally using metadata to put together the puzzle that identifies the author of anonymous content online in a way that would be admissible at trial. I'm good at this, and it's the kind of work I'm willing to spend 60 hours a week doing. I don't like the more ""lawyer"" part of my job: writing long memos on complicated/theoretical questions of law and thinking about problems that seem academic. (E.g. please write me a memo that analyzes the legal meaning of the word ""sale"" in New York). I hate this part of my job, and its what most attorneys spend 60 hours a week doing. I don't know how much longer I can do this part of my job without wanting to jump off a building. With that in mind, part of me wants to transition into computer forensics, and either work for law enforcement or as an expert witness. Here are my questions: * I am self-taught (and learning more every day) regarding computer forensics/hacking/cyber crime. I think I need more formal training to transition in a different career -- such as a degree in computer science. Do you agree or disagree with my assessment? Is there something else you would suggest? * If do need more formal training, would I need to go back to school and get a second bachelors in computer science, or would it be possible to get an advanced degree in a related field? I don't want to spend a bunch of money to do this the wrong way. (FWIW, my undergraduate degree is in Political Science from a state university and my law degree is from one of the top law schools in the U.S. I have a high GPA for both, if that matters for admissions.) In some ways, getting a bachelors feels like going backwards. * What schools do you recommend? What schools should I avoid because they are scams? * Am I being unrealistic? Do you have any other suggestions? Thank you so much! "
