Oracle puts out CPUs every quarter, but it's nigh impossible to find real, actionable information that discusses what EXACTLY a vuln does (and yes, I've been to the CPU 'discussion' site - URL but I'm looking for a level of brevity that discusses what the subsystem is and does, and how it interacts (or doesn't) with things like Cassandra, Splunk, and the like. We do not have a support contract with Oracle, and not exactly sure how to get one. I attempted to sign up for access, but I need verification from someone, plus a 'contract' number to verify who I am. Are there any good IRC, reddits, or anywhere that can get me more information about a vulnerability? Right now, I'm relying on MetaSploit (if a module exists), and just sitting here, I thought about following the dev cycle of OpenJDK, as the commit messages might suggest with commits fix what vuln, but I haven't worked out a good solution for that yet (or if it is even possible) I understand this is a 'dev' reddit, but some of you must think about security once in a while, right?

1,CVEs,java,Is mysql-connector-java-5.1.42 insecure?,8,6dc0nc,https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/6dc0nc/is_mysqlconnectorjava5142_insecure/,2017-05-26 05:50:19,"I ran OWASP Dependency Check against one of my projects, and it returned a large number of CVEs for mysql-connector-java. They all seem to be related to mysql versions. For example: Filename: mysql-connector-java-5.1.42.jar | Reference: CVE-2008-2079 | CVSS Score: 4.6 | Category: CWE-264 Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls | MySQL 4.1.x before 4.1.24, 5.0.x before 5.0.60, 5.1.x before 5.1.24, and 6.0.x before 6.0.5 allows local users to bypass certain privilege checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified (1) DATA DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are within the MySQL home data directory, which can point to tables that are created in the future. It doesn't make any sense to me, because this CVE is related to mysql version. Is this a false positive? Any idea why?"
