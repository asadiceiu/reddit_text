0,CVEs,dxm,Lack euphoria,3,fslhuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dxm/comments/fslhuv/lack_euphoria/,2020-04-01 08:14:40,I hear alot of speak of intense euphoria while on dxm but I have never gotten any myself. I have dosed 270-900mg on several occasions and I just wind up feeling funky unless I take enough for awesome CVES. The afterglow is nice but during im just fucked
1,CVEs,dxm,Anyone wondering if the magic comes back..,5,5wlgvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/dxm/comments/5wlgvi/anyone_wondering_if_the_magic_comes_back/,2017-02-28 13:59:32,"Yes. At least in my personal experience. Ive had over 90 trips within 2 to 3 months. I was barely feeling anything at doses 1500mg of hbr. I'd just feel stupid and intoxicated. I took a 1200 dose on this past Saturday after a month and a week hiatus. I ended up with a terrible roboitch that burned so bad I screamed and barely held onto the wheel, something that's never happened in all my dosings. This is coming from someone with a high pain tolerance; I was driving to the hospital, had to pull over and let my wife drive. Ended up going there, checked in honestly. They put me on oxygen, heart monitor, urine samples, blood tests, projectile vomiting, yadda yadda. Ended up having an insane trip regardless, saw some unknown deities that I've never experienced in all my dosings. I'd usually be lucky to get a head trip. More like weird thoughts and motions, feelings. Never had an OBE or cves. Had all of these this time and more. I had to find myself. After finding myself and learning how to feel things again, understand all my emotions, why things happen and exist, I had brief memory of my wife being there. I remember getting out of bed and I held her face, looked deeply into her eyes, told her I loved her more than anything in this world, kissed her like I'd never see her again, hugged her, and finally, blacked out. Woke up 6 hours later. Got transferred to PCU for the night under 24/7 observation until I was discharged at 5:30pm on Sunday. TL;DR, magic will come back, especially if you aren't expecting much. It will rape your soul. Enjoy, be safe, don't do stupid shit like me. Learned to respect it pretty quick after that. "
