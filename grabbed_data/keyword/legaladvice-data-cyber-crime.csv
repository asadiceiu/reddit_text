Ive complained to my girlfriend in the past about my very homophobic parents who are sometimes physically abusive when they drink, and verbally abusive when they dont. She obviously got worried something horrible happened and sent an email to the authorities ( shes in another country ) of my city. They responded the next afternoon knocking on my door, asking for me. I explained I was fine, nothing was going on and to go about their day. Of course, my mother would have none of this, and kept emailing/calling them until today they released the report to her, explaining someone had sent out an email saying she was abusive to me and they were concerned. Since we are in the middle of a pandemic and I have nowhere else to go currently Im concerned about whats going to happen next. What can the police share with her? Can they find my social media, texts, etc with my girlfriend and tell her what Ive said about her? Or will they withhold that information? Since my girlfriend sent an email can the cyber crime unit locate it back to her and tell my mom who it came from? Or will it all be up in the air? Im concerned about my mother finding out Im hiding my sexuality from her still and absolutely want to make sure the police do not share this with her, because it could put me out into the streets. What can I possibly do, and what will the police do in a follow up to her asking them to investigate the individual who sent the email? For details Im in the USA and live with my parents currently and am unemployed, disabled and cant currently move out due to the pandemic."
1,cyber-crime,legaladvice,Did the police make a classification mistake on the report? (Washington State),1,i8pjbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/i8pjbw/did_the_police_make_a_classification_mistake_on/,2020-08-13 10:12:50,"Hello! I filed a police report a couple of days ago. I reported a long range of behaviours that my stalkers did including unwanted pursuit, unwanted communication, unwanted gifts and letters, showing up at place unannounced (I never gave them their address), parking at my parking lot, then continuously calling, to cyber stalking on social media. I received the cope of the police report today and the crime is classified as RCW 9A.46.020.2A HARASSMENT MISDEMEANOR. I read up some information and was confused because: 1. I'm just not familiar with the laws and classifications. 2. The report is missing a lot of information I gave the officer. He only includes the showing up at my house and unwanted gifts. 3. Is the classification correct? I thought this would qualify for stalking. Thank you!"
2,cyber-crime,legaladvice,Need Justice for Mentally Ill Sister (Revenge P*rn),1,iag3el,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/iag3el/need_justice_for_mentally_ill_sister_revenge_prn/,2020-08-16 07:43:25,"My sister is 21 , homeless, and suffers from severe mental illnesses like schizophrenia and depression. She has been a runaway since 1 6, eventually got into a drug problem inducing these mental illnesses. She hasn't been on her medication, which usually stabilizes her, since April this year. We live in Los Angeles County, CA. Yesterday i was called by a psych hospital informing me that my sister was admitted there for a 51 50 hold. lts normal for me to get calls from hospitals/police stations bc she is always getting herself into dangerous situations. They told me that the police got 2 radio calls, and upon arrival found her lying unconscious on the ground w her legs in the road, nude and partially clothed. She was confused and disorganized so they took her to an emergency room at another hospital for medical evaluation, determined she was a danger to herself/others &amp; ordered the 51 50 sending her where she currently is now, the hospital which called me. Later her friends made me aware of a viral video going around instagram and some fb posts wherein my sister is being harassed by a group of men in a car. I've called lapd cyber crime unit &amp; they told me there's not an actual crime happening in the vid so there's nothing to press charges over We spent the day reporting posts and getting any account that we could to take it down. We are pretty sure we got most except this one guy. He still has the post up rn and has expressed no intention to remove it. He has reposted it and asked for it to go viral. Reporting it doesnt work. A lot of people became frustrated &amp; started spamming his page, a lot sending hate w/o my control. I never directed them to send hate his way. They were mostly name calling, spamming, making fun of him in general for not taking it down. I guess this angered the guy bc in retaliation, he then posted an image of my sisters genitals. She was in an uncompromising position. It seemed to be a screenshot from another video, and there was text cropped off on his post. In the caption of the post he used the hashtag viral. It looks like the same setting as the first viral video. lts definitely the same guys. The image was never posted to instagram before this guy tho, we know the original posters'@sand they never posted nudity. This was the first anyone has seen/known about this image. So we have been gathering screenshots of EVERYTHING bc we know this is a crime. Eventually the post was removed due to reports. This image is especially worrying when considering the way she was found by police and this video is her last known whereabouts before she was found unconscious and nude. We are afraid an assault may have taken place, and we want these people to pay. I want to know how we can get my sister some justice? I want to explain what's going on when her 51 50 hold is over and support her through a lawsuit but I really think I need to do this on her behalf, as it would be a huge emotional toll for her to see those guys should an assault have actually happened. How fast is it to get power of attourney? &amp; what does that mean? How can I ensure she won't run away before the process ends or what happens if she does? What is my case going to look like and how can I make this case as appealing as possible to a pro bono lawyer? Do i need to start a g*f*ndme ? Any other tips? The revenge porn pissed me off and I am determined to get justice in some way. Thanks to anyone who can help"
3,cyber-crime,legaladvice,A family member is electronically harassing me.,1,ibnez5,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ibnez5/a_family_member_is_electronically_harassing_me/,2020-08-18 07:30:58,"Sorry for the vague title. My older brother has sent me harassing e-mails intended to distress me through both my personal e-mail address and college e-mail address. He's also copied everything on my laptop Solid State Drive somehow; I'm guessing it was while I was away from the house. He was also previously monitoring my browsing activity and history, around the time he sent those e-mails. He's currently been printing out some of the stuff I've written in the past and writing responses line by line against longer things I've written, intending to cause me emotional turmoil and distress. He also makes remarks when I walk past him that show a complete lack of human decency or adherence to a basic code of conduct, that I can't bring myself to repeat here. What can I do? I fear he also may see this somehow so I was very hesitant to write it, but I can only hope not. **Details**: When he was sending the e-mails, I tried blocking the sender, but he has his own domain and was able to just generate addresses comprised of a random string of character ending with @[his domain]. He's worked in a relatively high position in cybersecurity with a salary in the 6 digits and is extremely adept with electronics (both hardware and software side) and computer science. I googled how to take legal action against cyber crime and he stopped sending the e-mails then and the e-mails were also deleted from my e-mail account somehow (though I deleted some of them myself in the lack of thought clarity in the moment). The e-mails he sent disguised their names (but not the addresses themselves, which were [string of characters]@[his domain]) as websites I have accounts on or mailing lists I'm subscribed to and had subject lines designed accordingly. I only opened a few of them. Later, when he realized I wasn't opening them, he started putting his messages in the placeholders for the name of the e-mail addresses and their subject lines. I didn't feel I had enough evidence against him, even moreso with the e-mails being deleted, and I also didn't want to punish him if I could avoid it, even if it was at my expense. While monitoring my web browsing was extremely discomforting, I could endure it, let it pass and instead started to go to a public institution to use the internet and stopped using it at home. However, later, he showed to me a printout of a scholarship essay I had written 4 years ago that was only on my hard drive and in my account portal on the scholarship website. I started thinking he had access to my files then, but logicked myself into thinking he got it through the online portal somehow. One of those scholarship essays also had information about why I wanted to go and tried applying to a specific top-ranked school, and he taped a list of tweets to my door, at the top of which he wrote (typed and printed) in a condescending manner that these tweets are explicit evidence that Ivy League schools are worthless besides the prestige. After I stopped using the internet at home, I spent my time at home studying a certain subject offline but on my computer. He put books related to that subject in front of my door. He did this after I googled something about what I was studying using a family member's phone, so I assumed he looked on that phone rather than watched what I was doing on my computer offline. However, later, at the public institution's internet, I searched up a physical authentication key for more protection on my e-mail, and when I came home, I found one taped to my door. It was then I decided to wipe my computer (but not format) completely, something I had been trying to avoid since it would have been painstaking and time-consuming. It took a huge amount of time to set up things again and I've only done so in a skeleton sense, I haven't set up most things I had previously, as I'm waiting to save up to buy a new computer (even though I just bought this one) in case he's still somehow able to access this one. A little later, I found a small screw on my floor and checked the bottom of my laptop and saw two screws missing. The screw I found was one of them, the other is still missing. I'm guessing he used the time I was out grocery shopping with a family member to open it and take the SSD out and copy it. This was around right before the time he sent me those e-mails, I believe. I don't know if he's planted anything physical inside the laptop; I tried opening the bottom and almost was able to take it off, but I felt the last pull would bend/damage the bottom in a way, so I didn't open it and just reattached the screws. After I wiped my drive and did the resetting, which was around July 10th or so, I've not let my computer be unattended for more than a few seconds at a time. I unplug it and take it with me, along with my external mouse and keyboard and a backpack full of sensitive and important stuff with me everytime I use the restroom. I barricade my door every time I sleep, as I don't doubt he may come in and do something during the time. Doing all of these things has been extremely inconvenient and wastes a lot of time, but there is not much I can do. Very recently, he printed out something very personal and sensitive that I had written for myself and written something in response to each line, sometimes having a response cover a single line, and sometimes one covering multiple. I keep my door open when I'm awake and he dropped it onto my bed. Even though I gave up hope for any sense of remorsefulness or reflection, any words of consideration of his current and past actions and their repercussions, there are times where I am just weak and have a slight foolish hope that maybe this will finally show the things he's too ashamed or pitiful to say, things that entail consideration and not just feeding his own desire. This is why I read some of his e-mails. So I just gave him one last chance, amongst many last chances, to read his words, so I took the printout, but only glanced at a very few words at the beginning, middle, and end, to see what the topic of the printout may be. There was nothing but heavy arrogance and condescension, and it seemed profanity-laden. I regret looking at the few words I did. However, what I wrote that he was responding to wasn't good for other eyes to see, either. I write from time to time thoughts that come, and sometimes I only reflect on those words and look at them through the lens of reason after I'm done writing them. He is reading the most sensitive and private things of mine, completely having a whole grasp of some departments of my internal self. That, even for me, is difficult to endure and allow. The scholarship essays already had too much info about me, and it was difficult to overcome knowing he's read them. My parents never let me go anywhere until I became an adult, so most of my time from 2010 to now besides school was spent on my computer, so it has copious amounts of information about me from then to now. I've tried to accept to live with the fact that he has all that info, and have always been really reluctant to bring punishment onto anyone for anything, especially when it comes to personal matters since I can endure it a lot, but when I think about the future and how he has the ability to probably ruin any relationships I have with anyone, including friends, job opportunities, and possibly my future family, it is sometimes extremely distressing. I don't know all the information I had on my laptop and everything I've written. I can't recall when I wrote the thing he had printed out, nor writing it. I really didn't want to use the law to force him to reflect, but him having access to my data is the only thing I can't forgive and gloss past in regards to personal matters. It's as though my whole identity's been stolen, the knowledge of myself that felt unique to me and isn't anyone else's. I might be okay with a person I trust having access to some of those things (although a person like that would have no interest in taking them), but this is someone I don't trust in the slightest, and one of the worst people to possess it. Him performing all these actions has made an already difficult job search even moreso and more exhausting. It's ruined the momentary joy I should have felt for graduating college, and the temporary excitement and energy that I would have had at the beginning of the job search. I had a job offer already that would have started in a few months, but it was taken away because of the virus. Now 3 months have passed by with most of my time and thoughts being given towards the actions he's taken against me, on top of an already quite difficult year. It's difficult to have clear focus on the things I must work on, as I think there is not purpose if he's likely going to ruin them. I feel as though I cannot make progress in legal action though, as the e-mails are gone, and I have really no evidence except for the recent printout, and the printout of the tweets I had mentioned, though I don't know how I would prove the printouts are his. I don't know how law enforcement could obtain a warrant to search his devices. It would also be bad if he sees this post and takes more safeguards or destroys evidence. I do not feel he's been able to see my activity ever since I wiped my computer or my files, but he may just be hiding it. He's much more intellectually capable and naturally intelligent than me. He may also be able to use the fact that I used to check his Twitter from time to time to diminish my case, though I only checked to skim and search for any signs of an internal feeling of apology and reflection or a change and maturity of heart. He has a tweet from a few years ago saying he's doxxing me right now and one from the same year a picture of my room (which is very plain and empty) asking how someone lives here (the room). I hope he doesn't see this and delete them. I'm not sure if those could help in receiving aid from law enforcement. He also may use the case that I don't speak a word to him to build a defense of pity or sympathy, one that may place blame onto me for causing him to take those actions, though it would only be an act. I'm also afraid to take legal action because I have streamed and torrented anime and very rarely video games (though I never end up playing very long or very far), would that end up with me being prosecuted? I intended to pay for the ones I had seen/downloaded as I started making money, but I know that's after the fact. What might I be able to do, if anything? Thank you for your assistance."

5,cyber-crime,legaladvice,"My ex, who has full custody of my daughter, was charged with something that I turned him in for. Why was I not notified as her legal parent, just without custody?",1,icrwej,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/icrwej/my_ex_who_has_full_custody_of_my_daughter_was/,2020-08-20 03:15:37,"As the title states, I turned my ex in back in 2018 after I had been given information from a family member that he was sending genital pictures to a 14 year old female. An officer in my area came and took a report. I emailed him every piece of evidence I had. Things like screenshots from his fake Facebook account of him telling this young girl that he was going to send the pictures even if she said no, that he could curl her toes, that she looked good, along with the genital pictures. 4 to be exact. I lost custody of our child after we split up in 2015. I was deemed ""unfit"" because I was ""becoming disabled."" I JUST got my disability approved this month. A while later in 2018, that same officer contacted me stating they couldn't do anything unless the mother and little girl come forward. She wouldn't as drugs are involved heavily in her life. Thinking I could do nothing else I sat back and awaited a channel to open for another way to turn him in. I found that way. The national center for missing and exploited children. I filed a cyber tip with them. They processed the information and sent it to the my local taskforce for internet crimes against children. After that I received no contact for about a week so I call to find the report and check it's status. I had difficulty locating someone to speak with but finally a technician called me. They stated he WAS IN FACT CHARGED in 2018 from the evidence and the investigation that occurred. The tech said his case was sealed. How? And why? I don't know exactly what they charged him with as the case is sealed. But why, with him being investigated for such a crime, was I not contacted? I'm currently raising a nine month old just fine. Why was I not even thought of as a possible placement for my child? How did this happen without me being notified? My child could very well be unsafe with him given his actions towards a child not even ten years older than his daughter? I personally feel she is unsafe..... Am I wrong for thinking that? I've called county attorneys, they say I need to hire a PI. I've called cps, there isn't any evidence my child is in immediate danger! Dhhs concerning why I wasn't contacted, a week and I still have no call back. What else can I do? How did I get overlooked completely with such a serious charge against him? Why was a similar case publicized but his wasn't? I'm sorry I'm all over the place, I'm angry and anxious and scared for my child. (Just to give some insight, I left him due to his inability to keep his genital pictures to himself. Going as far as sending them to both my stepmom and my bio mother, my stepmom's best friend, even my aunt through marriage. He threw chairs into walls, broke a lamp shade above my head raining glass down on me, and throwing my keys at me with our then infant in my hands during arguments. He had money, I didn't. And no attorney was appointed as it was not a criminal case. I got railed in court and my daughter was given to this man.) 1. Why was I not notified as I'm stable, capable, and willing to keep her safe at home with me? 2. Why was I not contacted given the severity of the possible charges he was facing when both our child and that poor girl are underage? 3. Why and how does one get a case like this sealed? 4. How does he NOT have to be on the registry? 5. Do I really need to hire a PI? 6. Why wasn't his case publicized when an almost carbon copy case was all over the news? 7. Is money that influential, that a minor female is deemed safe to live with a proven predator? 8. What can I be doing that I'm not, or haven't yet? Any information is greatly appreciated and if more information is needed from me I'll be sure to update. Thank you."

He was into hard drugs and dealing. At one point he got her involved, moved out and let her take the fall for him. Later on he squatted in my parents' shed, stole from them and stole my ladies' mountain bike. He was abusive to my sister over the years and she couldn't seem to get away from him. She picked up his heroin habit and he became her dealer. Long story short, 2 years ago in February, my sister Od'd. We had texts showing that he sold her the drugs, and he was arrested a few short weeks later with the same batch of drugs. Her last text to a friend was at 12:30 am the day she died. She was found on her front lawn, in the snow, belongings strewn around her by a passerby 2 hours later. The anonymous passerby, a female, called the cops. The guy didn't. I understand concerns of getting arrested but he had a 10 year history with her and could have simply used her finger to hit the emergency button on her iphone, but he didn't bother. She was still breathing when found but died, and very likely might have lived had EMS been called to the scene sooner. A detective in the town she passed in attempted to go after him for strict liability due to the fact that the batch he sold my sister contained fentanyl. However, bc my sister was on psychiatric drugs at the time, this couldn't stick due to the interaction that could take place and kill her anyway. He refused to talk to the police about that night and his phone was encrypted. It was painful for my family and I. A year to the day of my sister dying, my Dad, a healthy (64M) died suddenly. The doctor speculated the stress killed him. Not long after Dad's death, the guy my sister knew tried to contact us through the funeral home, wanting to see my sister's final resting place. The detective was kind enough to call him on our behalf and tell him that any future contact would constitute harassment. Now we received unemployment paperwork addressed to my dead sister from another state saying someone is using her social to work and trying to collect unemployment with it. I strongly suspect this same guy because: \-his sister lives in that state and he has lived there on and off several times \-he knew all of my sister's personal information \-he has several judgements against him and if he puts down his own social his wages will be garnished I tried to make a report with my local police station and the cop told me basically that my sister is dead and therefore he's not even sure if it's a crime, and they have no cyber crimes division. I spoke with my state police today and they told me to go back to the state the crime took place in. I live a ways from this state and could not possibly go file in person. I am trying to figure out how to hold this individual responsible. This letter destroyed my mom, who is my last remaining family member. His callous actions over the year have contributed in a big way to the utter destruction of my family and I need this to stop. I just want to be left alone. Any ideas/ suggestions would be helpful. So far I have: \-contacted local police \-contacted the detectice \-contacted the state police \-pulled my sister's credit report which showed a lot of inquiries on her social over the last couple of months including an attempt to take out a car note I need justice for my baby sister. Yes, I hold her accountable for her choices, but nobody deserves to die in February on a front lawn alone in the snow."
8,cyber-crime,legaladvice,Reporting online impersonation by a US perpetrator when I'm not American,1,hkhyyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/hkhyyl/reporting_online_impersonation_by_a_us/,2020-07-03 22:11:39,"The profiles in question break my local law due to the type of content they post, in addition to the defamation and search engine results they leave when people look me up. The campaign is sustained and resembles a game of whack-a-mole ten months in. &amp;#x200B; Advice I received so far centers on treating this as a civil matter, but I am sure this breaks the person's local criminal law, at least in the state they reside in (NY), do correct me if I'm wrong though. My question is how do I approach this? Do I need a lawyer to handle this case on my behalf? Can I just ask a US based friend of mine to assist me in getting the police's attention? Would they even care considering the victim is foreign? Is it possible to go the federal route rather than the state one? (I already tried IC3). &amp;#x200B; Does anyone know of lawyers that would offer at least a free consultation on this general topic, whether it's state specific, or international cyber crime more broadly? Or otherwise a resource I could learn more from. I don't find much on my particular case because it straddles a line between more benign forms of cyber harassment, and more serious forms of cyber crime so I inevitably get led to reading about one or the other."

Thought I was smart enough to find a solution stumbling through darkweb, I'm not. I just don't know what to do anymore, and my mental health is getting...bad. I've had a same sex stalker for two years. The harassment has been consistent, line crossing and is getting crazier and crazier. It includes slander and libel. (I have sent take down requests.) I have been to the police. All of my collected evidence, is ""just short"" of the evidence my area requires to do anything. I don't go out anymore, I'm constantly hiding and watching my back. She is friends with lawyers, so she knows exactly how close to the edge of legal she can go. The police will not search her, her place, her work, her phone, anything, unless I can give them something that blatantly resolves back to her or something under her name. I explained how they can ethically hack to get concrete evidence - but my area is clearly useless with cyber crime. She also works for the government of my country, so that's a special kind of hell. She has access to the passport computer systems. Even if I could get time off to travel - I have no idea what's waiting for me when my passport gets scanned. I am so frustrated and tired. The little bit of sanity I found living with PTSD is gone, I can't take any more. Any suggestions on shutting her down?"
10,cyber-crime,legaladvice,How to prosecute hacking? (Texas),1,hs2dgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/hs2dgd/how_to_prosecute_hacking_texas/,2020-07-16 13:31:03,"Hi all, I'm currently in the midst of an investigation of hacking of my home devices/LAN. I've filed a police report, put in an ic3 with the FBI, and let my family know. I know the person responsible for hacking me, his name/location/family/etc. I know it's very hard to get these things investigated, in my case because no crime has been committed other than this breach of unauthorized access. They probably have full view of my host/network logs/DNS and so on, and they simply enjoy letting me know that they are doing this to me, as well as playing head games on websites I frequent (like Discord). Their goal I think is to separate me from interacting with anyone online, which is where my friends are. They've also spit out death threats/character assassinations in an attempt to make me crazy over the past several months (might be close to a year now). So I hired a cyber investigative service to look at my LAN/a few devices. My question now is, if and when they find evidence of unauthorized access, what can I do with this? I need to connect the existence of my LAN/etc. being hacked with their actions (that they hacked me). Otherwise they can say ""Idk, wasn't me, could've been anyone,"" in which case I can't get it investigated by police. Now hopefully what they do is find the IP of the attacker. If they trace this to a VPN, I understand that they must subpoena the VPN service, which apparently is a breeze in a civil suit or if you're police. But I'm struggling in finding something actionable as to how they are attacking me. For example, they make fake discord accounts and post content that targets me, but could be interpreted as random by outside strangers. It's gang stalking essentially. And that kind of material is really hard to prosecute, due to how passive or hidden it is. So my question is, basically, what on earth can I do?"

I was arrested in 2017 for some Cyber Crime. I don't think the details of my crime matters but if it does let me know i can share. When i was arrested at my college they took my laptop bag on me which had my brand new laptop and phone. When i was in jail before let out on bail they said they're going to keep my laptop and phone as evidence. Before trial i took a plee deal and got 3 years probation. My Probation ended 2 weeks ago and my probation officer told me to call to get my stuff back. I called and the place won't explain anything to me, they said i need to talk to a lawyer for a civil case. I asked around and was told that they're holding it as evidence incase i try to appeal, but the thing is my laptop was literally brand new, it had nothing on it. My phone on the other hand had evidence so i figured i'd never get that back. Is there anyway I can go about getting my stuff back without hiring a lawyer? I feel the cost of a lawyer and court fees and all that will offset the price of a 2k laptop. Please advise me, anything i left out just ask Btw i live in New Jersey Thank you!"

I was messaged by a lady and after exchanging greetings she asked to exchange live camera photos to ensure we were both real. She then asked for a live picture of my penis and she would in turn send a pic of her back as well (which in hindsight shouldve been a red flag but I was in a depressed state of mind and wasnt thinking 100%). We then exchanged Instagram follows and she said she was working on sending a short video over to me instead of the picture. Except she didnt, and instead put together a collage of the two live pics I sent her plus a screenshot of my IG profile name and people who Im connected to on IG. She threatened to send the pics to everyone on my IG connections list if I didnt send her $300 to which I told her I didnt have it. I told her all I had was $20 and she then asked for a $50 iTunes gift card. I told her I could only do one for the $20 I had. She said fine but Ill still need to pay $300 but I can start small with the $20. I told her new deal, Ill get her the $20 gift card and its settled or Im going to report this to the police. Her response was fine if thats the case make it $50. Fast forward and I send her the $20 gift card after stalling to file a report with the FBI Cyber Crime Division as well as file reports with Kik hoping for a swift response. I send proof of the $20 transaction and she says we agreed on $150 so now I have $130 to pay. I tell her BS and ignore her while still trying to get responses from Kik. I tell her again Im going to the police and she goes off and sends a screenshot of what she sent to one of the people on my IG friends list. I manage to get her to agree to wait for additional payment until tomorrow (all of the above happened last Friday) but with her threatening to make sure I get fired and what not, Im trying to find advice and help everywhere. Firstly, can I be fired if somehow she finds my employer info out (work in local government) and sends it to work emails of various people who also work for the local government? Secondly, what additional recourse do I have? As far as I can ascertain she only has my IG info which is fine as Ive already mitigated the threat on there by making people aware not to answer messages from randoms. Ive email Kiks support 3 times now and get an auto reply of 2-3 business days before I may get a response. Ive filed the FBI info as I said above and reported her IG profile as well but it all still exists. I need advice please. Im in Texas btw if it matters."

14,cyber-crime,legaladvice,[URGENT] Need help with copyright infringement threats in Korea,1,gy84y1,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gy84y1/urgent_need_help_with_copyright_infringement/,2020-06-07 17:46:53,"Hello. I'd like to ask for your legal advice on my situation. This situation is regarding COPYRIGHT of a book. I received a message from someone who's claiming to be a marketing team of the company which owns its copyright. It said that I violated their copyright so they will report to find my personal information and sue me. He or she also said that I would get a legal notice and after that, I would have to attend the police office. If any question, call their service center (the company). So these are the messages I received and let me describe the process until I received it. There is a cafe (online website) for information and study. There is a category that people post to buy and sell books. I looked for some book and someone approached me and said he has an authorized document file that is same as the book and sold it to me. Later on, I was just browsing through the website and saw people looking for the same book file, so I made an open chat link so that they can reach me. My intention was just to share because the book is out of print and hard to buy(I didn't know it was illegal at the moment) but when the person 'who's claiming to be the marketing team' chatted me and first said I want to buy -&gt; so I said you want to buy? -&gt; the person asked is it a book or a copy book or something else -&gt; I said No it's a file and I just offered a few $ for the price since the person offered to buy -&gt; the person asked is it a file? You must be making much money out of it -&gt; so I said No I haven't sold any -&gt; then the person changed attitude and said he or she is going to report me and mentioned that the person is working at the marketing team and got a report that people are sharing or selling -&gt; and the person said going to report it to cyber police to find my personal information and sue me and I would get a legal notice later after their procedure. -&gt; I apologized but the chat ended without their response I'm not sure if the person is actually from the company or a scammer. I was not aware of copyright for the file, I thought as I buy some book and after I use, I just sell it or share it. I didn't intentionally mean to violate their copyright. I just wanted to share to the people who were desperately looking for the book. After I got the message, I searched about it and I reflect on my ignorance. My question is 1. Should I call the service center and explain the situation and express I was not aware and didn't mean to do and I apologize and deleted everything and I would never make same mistake again but I'm afraid that they are just going to record this and use it as an evidence like I admitted my ""crime"" myself and use it to sue me. Or 2. Should I just leave it and see what's going to happen and hopefully nothing is going to happen. My country is Korea and I searched they can sue me within 6 months since they notice it. People would be sued and either being able to settle and pay for the settlement money they ask or getting fined and legally punished. I'm not sure what I should do as I'm not wise at legal matters.. ----------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------- tl;dr -&gt; got accused of copyright infringement from an employee of the publisher's marketing time who pretended to be a buyer and then said they will report me to the police. Should i call service center to apologize ? or just ignore it and take it as an empty threat."

It seemed innocent at first but the conversation began to lean sexual. I should have stopped it but I didnt and thats where I screwed up. She sent a photo and asked for one in return and so i did and it went on like this for the night. I knew it was wrong and when she began to ask what else we could do i began trying to backpedal and told her that I would never physically cheat on my wife. and that nothing would happen and that I was willing to be friends and text but that would be all. Long story short (on the next day) her tone changed drastically and now she is demanding $1000 or she will tell my wife. I know this is extortion and I know not to pay into it. I have already told my wife and had my wife block her. And I told my local law enforcement, submitted a form for cyber crime on the FBI webpage, and I reported it to facebook directly. However I dont know what this girl will do. As soon as she realizes she cant get money from me, and then that she cant contact my wife, what about the rest of my family? I have an uncommon last name so it's easy to find my family and then if she already took note of my other friends, what's to stop her from messaging them? I know i got myself into this but what can i do? Where do I go from here? I didn't do anything illegal, just wrong and she could ruin my life with it. I have not blocked her yet as she gave me until 3:00 today to pay her the $1000 to keep quiet but do I tell her to cease and desist because I've reported it to authorities or would that risk pissing her off more? I'm at a loss. I wish there was a way to be able to keep her from messaging anyone I know. &amp;#x200B; Edit for location: Me: FL USA. Her: Some other state USA"

Currently one of our family member (I'm gonna call them X) is at Abu Dhabi for work purpose and got stuck there due to the cornoa virus situation. They are currently at a hotel and would be staying there till things settle down. X received an email in their company mail ID from a person ( gonna call hacker) claiming to know their password. The hacker mentioned the password, and blackmailed that if we don't send 2000 USD within 24 hours then pornographic videos with X's face would be uploaded on various site and sent on WhatsApp to friends and relatives. The password mentioned is not used by X on facebook or email Id. Only for Amazon prime and other non social media platforms. Since it was the company mail id to which it was sent, we first forwarded the email to the relevant department of the company seeking for their help. Then we sent another mail asking them if we need to contact Abu Dhabi police directly. Also X has deleted their Facebook account. But this takes 30 days to process and anyone in the mean time could login to cancel it. Our fear is that X's laptop and phone have been hacked using the hotel's wifi. So how should we proceed now?

There isn't a common registration system, so there's no way to know who holds a domain unless the holder approaches the potential buyer.

I was advised to make a report with the Cyber crime sector but it's kinda tricky because I don't want the person to get into any trouble I just want to know what exactly could happen in this situation. For reference the 1st time this happened to me I reported it and the culprit I assume was arrested on frsud because he disappeared soon after. This isn't a fruad issue I don't think just nosey persons being nosey. Any cellular info on thwarting spying also appreciated. Thank you.

My neighbor then walked up to my door knocked and kept bugging me and inciting me even more, even saying I was harassing her. I told her to stop recording me. I never opened the door or showed my face but if anyone knows her address they'll know mine and I can be outed (doxxed) online, or maybe she will dox me herself. I said some nasty things but I was very upset and never threatened her or opened my door to confront her. It was her that came to my door and hit record.

Parent then reads minor's DMs, and claims to have screenshotted and submitted to cyber crime unit and detective has reached out. Thoughts: Adult didn't really do anything illegal (don't think), but can see how/why the Parent thinks so. Parent claims the adult will be arraigned for solicitation of minor. Questions: 1) If the account was deleted, can cyber crime unit still read the messages (either in favor of, or against the Adult's claim)? Based on the messages/account, can they actually figure out who the Adult is and find them? 2) If so, what would happen? Does the adult have to show up in court to explain their side, or do they simply get arrested and embarrassed in the public?"

An acquaintance of mine and an ex-girlfriend of this same boy, of whom I will refer to as Rick\*, also told me personally that she had been sexually abused and raped by Rick as well, almost two years after the incident. No one filed any sort of report until about three weeks ago, I used a state-wide system to report the sexual abuse after finally cracking because I did not feel comfortable holding onto that information while Rick went throughout life without being touched. The school, alongside the police of the county the school is based in both opened investigations into the allegations and so far, all that can be done is. 1.) Victim 1(My girlfriend, referred to henceforth as Jane) is now removed from her 3rd period class, as Rick also takes this class. 2.) Jane originally said she did not feel comfortable at all being around Rick and the school proposed having him become fully-cyber(schooling done online versus in-building) and then they said they were only able to move a few of his classes because he's only being accused, versus charged with any crime. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; I know this might be convoluted, I can provide any information anyone needs besides names or identifying information.

No teachers came to know about it but the video was viral in my higher secondary boys. Then one day we had a program in our school (phone's are not allowed in schools here but most of my classmates brings them) and few of my classmates where clicking selfies at the terrace and they were caught. we were allowed to bring phone's as we were having programs. Later these boys were called up and they went through the gallery and saw the video I took. One of my friends came and told me about this so i used a Google's feature which can remotely lock phone's if you claim it as lost. The school never came to know that i was the reason the phone got locked. Then later they called me up (I'm pretty famous as a ""hacker"" in my school as I've completed CEH and my principal talks about it everywhere. I've also demoed attacks and few of my projects to him) and asked me to bring my phone. When i brought it to them they asked me to unlock it and i said NO (I know they can't force me since there was a global law that says that no one can force unlock anything belonging to them with bio metrics and that's a really intense crime and I've the right to my privacy.) They asked me why and i explained em that i don't want to let anyone get into my privacy and that's against the law. The teachers were like there were students body shaming teachers and isn't that iligeal they were referring to meming so i told that that trolling others is offensive but even the president is getting trolled and no one's getting punished for that. Then one of the teachers asked me to take my phone and leave. The next day i went to the teacher at whose class i took the video and confessed that i did it. He said he had no problems but my class teacher and computer sci teacher are the ones blowing it. He asked my to apologize to them but i refused as i didn't like them. At afternoon we were having a zero period so I was standing in my corridor and my dad came to the school. He asked me why did the principal called me and i said i had no idea even tho i knew the reason. All the teachers who were involved were acting nice and was talking about my academics and nothing about the video. Then the teacher said me to go and meet the principal (I thought there was not gonna be any problem. Meeting the principal was normal for me as i was staying alone and first time in India i had special care and the principal loved my works.) The principal started by saying that I'm pretty talented and all but he thinks that I'm turning into a black hat. He said that he called one of his friends in the police to tell me the consequences i can face if i do stuff that are iligeal. I thought he was boasting about it like he always does. Unfortunately within 5 min a Sub Inspector of Shadow police of Kerala (like an undercover cop looking for drugs and sex trafficking between students) and a constable came to the room and i was shocked at the scene. The principal was like when he asked me to unlock my phone i said that i won't let anyone get into my ""cyberspace"" (yeah it just means internet but for them its like a terrorist group). I said that i didn't say cyber space and i clearly used the term privacy. And he was like don't lie I'll call the teacher and ask and i was like go ahead (TBH i was sure they can't do any shit to me since i knew i didn't do anything wrong.) The teacher said that i just said privacy. The next question he raised was why do a 17 year old need privacy? Well I told em what i said to you guys before and also at the last pages of our textbooks we had a page called student rights and in that it has clearly said that we have the right to privacy and you've to start reading textbooks instead of 7 year olds magazine (he claimed he reads them as they provide with GK in one of our assembly). I know i should've acted cool but they brought the cops just for recording a video of my friends sleeping in the class. There was no face of teachers or anything just my friends sleeping. Then they started saying that I've been editing my females classmates faces into pornography and I'm blackmailing them which hit me hard even today. The reason it hit me hard was I've helped a girl whom i never knew, whose leaked masterbution video came in a pornographic website and get family tried filling case and they went behind this and nothing was done for 2 months (everyone in my city knew about her and the video) until she came to me. I simply mailed by saying I'm the chief IT officer working at the Indian cyber cell and that there domain will be taken down as this girl is a minor and she was not willing for this. It just took me 2 hours to take down. And also another 2 cases who send there nudes to there bf and they were scared about it and i helped to take it down. I know I've broken the laws but i felt like I was saving lives so it didn't matter and i never expected anything back from any of these 3 girls. I was just trying to save. And a person like me who helped these people in this kind of case for free without anything and the school said that I did this (they never knew about any of these. No one did except my super close friends.). It broke me inside and i felt like throwing the chair at him when he said that. I started crying in the room and i told me dad that i never did this. The second thing they said that i threatens students for money and all my classmates are scared of me which i felt like funny. I was harsh with him and asked him for proof of everything. He said that my female classmates said this and i asked for names and he said that he couldn't say those as he promised them and the funniest part is he didn't say them not even to the officer. Then i said them about these three girls and i helped them and thankfully this police man knew that girls father whoose video was leaked. Then all of them were sent out and it was just me and the policeman and he started talking about drugs and smoking and i stopped him and cleared him that i was not into any of that. I told him I'm trying to stay as low key as possible and he asked me if I've hacked anyone's account. I mean how dumb is that question you're asking a thief how many people I've hacked and i was like just 2(that would be the only cases he would be aware of since one was as about a boy whoose chat i leaked and other was for a friend who asked me to hack there own account (i didn't hack it i just helped to recover the password but the whole school took it as hacking.)) then he said me that if his phone gets hacked he would go to the extreme end which he was kind of mentioning me so i replied by saying that he would never know. Then we chatted about how not to get hacked and all. Then i was sent out and he called everyone who he sent out before. I didn't know what happened in there then after that they called me in and the principal asked me that won't i get punished if I'm caught i was like ya but they won't catch me and he laughed at me by saying that the cyber cell is far advanced than you think. The police man was like here the only department that gets weekly updates is the Indian cyber cell. I told them i was using the [tor](URL network which is a kind of proxy that makes you anonymous online. They laughed again so i was like I'll tell you three things why they can't get me. 1) [The Lulz sec] case in 2011. I used the same protocols. 2) That girls case which i mentioned earlier. Her dad begged for 2 months to the police. 3) i don't recall What was it when i do I'll edit this post. And then i asked the police man if I'm wrong and he didn't say anything and the principal was like this is his problem. Then there was nothing important but the best part was my dad trusted me i love him for that. After a while I was called to the control room where they were like why i hacked... Why I did that... Didn't you know it was iligeal... And also they took blood samples from me and checked my nails and all i don't know why was it. Later i felt like my phone was being tapped as my mom started to talk about stuff she didn't know. I changed my phone and ig everything's fine now. Later one day i heard rumours about me by the teachers that i uploaded the video of that girl to the website and the police man came to arrest me. I was pissed but i ignored it completely and told my friend who told me about this that it's just jobless people. I really had 100% support from my classmates and batch. Once when a teacher said about this to there class that I uploaded the video and all one of my friend said that she's wrong and the whole class protested against it. The school have been playing really unfair and except 6 student everyone hated the school. The school kind of showed partiality within boys and girls and Toppers and others. I never went behind all the rumours the teachers had since then most of the teachers started hating me idek where i did wrong. One day when i was walking by i pulled 1 or maybe 2 hair from my GF and one of the teachers saw that and made a scene. She said pulling her hair would affect the school's reputation (rip logic). It was just a regular day and there was no one. I kind of made the scene like a joke and that teacher was like ok I'll call her mom and tell about this so i was like about pulling hair? Ok Go ahead. Later that night my GF called me and she said that the teacher called and she said that I'm a hacker and there's a police case going on me (there was no case against me charged.) I'll black mail her daughter, ask her to stay away from me, I'm a hacker there has been plenty of cases and about me and she knew everything about all and it was really worse. Next day i went to that teacher and asked her politely how many students do you know that I've hacked and she said they she's not interested to talk with me, she turned around and walked away to the staff room. I got so pissed that i went to the staff room and shouted that if this is how you plan on taking this, i won't take it easy on you. I went straight to the principals room and complained. He said no teacher would do that and my GF is simply lying about it. No matter how much i plead to him he said that no teacher would do that. Later that day he called my GF and her teacher and blamed my GF for telling it to me. I felt like i had to take it to the PTA members but my GF was like don't make it a scene and kind of cried so I didn't do anything. I told my mom and she was really pissed. Next day when she came she shouted at my class teacher (not to her teacher, but she was listening). We went to meet the principal and he started off by saying that I'm arrogant and violent to the teachers is this is the case we have to dismiss him and he's not taking any action coz I've lot of potential in me. He also said that after leaving the school i would get kicked out because of my attitude. I didn't like anything he said so i asked him about calling a police without my knowledge (it's a crime here as I'm in a school and I'm a minor) and we have CCTV cameras in the toilet area (area means the place where we wash our hands) they say it's for safety well OK it's for safety but one time when i was changing my pants he showed it to all the teachers. Isn't that a offense i asked him and he was like ""are you trying to scare me? If so i won't. Idk why i don't feel fear I'm sorry my dear. "" I replied that I'm not an expert psychologist but ik some according to that you're scared. Don't deny me accept it. my mother took his side when she heard about dismissing me and i was left with no choice. It's just not me who they've played unfair with me. This is just one of the cases as there are worse ones too of my friends. Can I sue my school for this? Can i file a case for mental torturing and spreading fake news about me? I just helped few people in saving the lives and this is how it got back to me. Thanks for reading!"

My friend has never once logged into Facebook on the iPad and has not downloaded the Facebook or messenger apps onto it. It also has a separate iCloud account not synced to her own. Her Facebook password has suddenly changed and the email linked to the accounts password has also changed. She guesses he has first hacked her email, guessing the two security questions and used that as a way into Facebook. He is telling her he has seen Her messages to her new partner including personal pictures sent. She is horrified and embarrassed. He is adamantly denying he hacked the account, telling her not to be so ridiculous. Im wondering where she stands on this. At the moment, she cant access her email or Facebook. Unfortunately the mobile phone number linked to Facebook is old. Were going to try and get her back in on her email and go from there. Were in the UK and Ive googled and can see its classed as a cyber crime. Does she have grounds for prosecution? Could she call the police regarding this? And can they prove it was him or will it likely just not be taken any further? I just really feel like its a massive violation of her personal information and shes so humiliated hes seen pictures not intended for him. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks."

(IL)",1,eo9w67,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/eo9w67/i_have_tried_multiple_times_to_get_my_abusive_ex/,2020-01-14 07:36:16,"Back in July I got a protective order against my abusive husband. I then went to the states attorneys office because he was violating it repeatedly and I was in fear for my life. I had a meeting with 2 ADA's, the victim advocate, and a detective. Unfortunately due to the nature of his violations (mostly online/cyber hacking and harassment) they told me it would be a difficult case to prosecute and they didn't have enough evidence. Everyone was respectful and seemed to at least believe me though- except the detective. He was openly hostile, especially when I asked if they would consider pressing charges for sexual assault- my husband had raped me as his last act of abuse, it was the basis for the order. The detective LAUGHED and said ""you guys are married, things happen in a marriage"". The next day this man calls me accusing me of stealing a phone charger from their office and threatened to put out a warrant if i didn't return it. The supposed victim of this theft was actually the victim advocate. I have talked to her and she says she has no idea why the detective did this- she never said I stole anything and even if I had, it was a $10 charger, she wasn't going to throw a DV victim in jail for something like that. All she said was she couldn't find her charger after she let me borrow it. The backstory there- after our meeting she let me stay in her office while I waited to go before the judge (I had to amend the OP to include my daughter as a protected party) because I was terrified to be out in public. I had been using my friend's son's iPhone that day since my ex had installed spyware on my phone, and I didn't own an iPhone charger, so she offered to let me use hers. The first thing I did when I left after my hearing was buy a replacement phone- an Android! So even if I was the kind of idiot who would steal from the ADA I had no motive to take that specific item. I told this detective as much when we spoke- said I didn't have the VA's charger but I went out and bought a new one and dropped it off at their office just to be on the safe side. Then a few days later after having one conversation with my ex he closed the entire investigation stating I had lied in my petition for the OP (I got the date wrong by a day) and that I stole a phone charger from the States Attorney My ex of course blasted this all over social media and sent it to everyone we know. I'm mortified. And now worried I won't get the plenary OP because a 20 year veteran officer said I was a liar AND a theif to boot. I felt threatened enough to not feel comfortable going to the ADA's office again, and because I felt like nothing would be done to stop my ex I ended up fleeing the state. I feel like a victim reporting a crime should at the very least not have to worry about getting threatened with charges, especially over something so minor. I also question how the mountain of evidence I showed them (including my exes phone logged into my Facebook account within hours of being served) was not enough to charge my ex, but a cell phone charger turning up missing after I happened to use it was enough to put a warrant out on me. This is not the first time I've had issues like this either. Back in 2016 he was arrested or domestic battery but his charges were dropped 72 hours later without warning or explanation. I called the ADA and was told there wasn't enough evidence to prosecute. He had a dislocated my jaw, and his attack was witnessed by my daughter (who heard me screaming ""stop, please, you're going to kill me"" for almost 20 fucking minutes) and we were BOTH willing to testify. I had gone to the ER so my injuries were documented- including bruising on my neck from him choking me. That time when I called the ADA I was told I was ""lucky"" they didn't charge ME because I punched him in self defense. ""Mutual combat"" she called it. The second time I tried to prosecute him or at least have him put on a 5150 hold, he had told me he bought a gun and laid out in graphic detail how he planned on using it to blow my brains out. He had his hand under a blanket making a shape of a gun- he didn't actually have one, but I sure thought he did (he had owned a firearm at one point). I ran into the bathroom locked the door and called 911 as he started taking the doorknob off with a screwdriver. It was one of the most terrifying experiences of my life. The police got there just as he had gotten through the door and I was cowering in the corner of our closest sobbing hysterically. They didn't even arrest him that night- in fact they didn't even make a police report! They took him to a hotel, and he was back within an hour to continue terrorizing me. I talked to the ADA about that one but of course without so much as a police report there was nothing they could do. But what gets me is the ADA said no crime was even committed in the first place...how is that not a crime?? Based on my lay knowledge of the law it should at least rise to the level of a criminal threat, but IANAL. So anyways that brings me to today- I have more evidence now because of course my ex never stopped violating the OP and got even bolder after he got away with it. I still for some reason had hope they might take action this time but I also wanted to see if anything could be done to protect me from this detective so I called internal affairs. I explained the situation and my fears- the officer I spoke with said he would look into it and get back to me. He just called me back and said he spoke with this detective  and I didn't have anything to worry about BUT he also told me I shouldn't bother talking to them again because ""they probably won't do anything"". What the fuck? Is this normal? I feel like nothing short of him murdering me is going to result in any consequences and he would probably get away with that too. I have no experience dealing with prosecutor's outside of my dealings with this office so I guess I'm just wondering if this is a standard way crimes like this are dealt with, or if my ex is getting special treatment. He's a politically appointed state employee who handles multi million dollar contracts so he has some influence along with his connections. I just have a feeling if he was Pookie from the block he would be serving hard time already. I'm in Springfield IL."

I am scared for my life. This is a ""throwaway"" account for obvious reasons. This is all about throwaway accounts ironically. Last year I was dating a girl for several months, at the end we had a miscommunication about what she wanted and she became pregnant. It was one of this issues that we split up over and in the heat of moment she believed she needed a Protection From Abuse order. I allowed a default judgement to happen because I did not want to fight with her in court at all, I was too sad. There was no actual abuse ever in our relationship outside of disagreements, not verbal, physical or otherwise. She simply had raised hormones and really did not like some of my opinions on that matter but it was not abuse. I talked to people about the breakup and abortion to grieve and may have made a post about how sad I was to have an abortion. Roughly 6 months went by and everything was fine until one day I get a call from a police officer explaining they have an arrest warrant for me for harassing my ex on Facebook before even asking me any questions, claiming they had tried to call earlier but I never received any missed calls. He tells me that the profile name is (lets say for story purposes) Jason(not my name, not even close) and that Jason has been threatening my ex. I explain to him that this is impossible because I have her blocked on my Facebook account, and agree to be cooperative and allow him to do whatever they need to prove it was not me, but that it was definitely not me. I was certain they would rescind a warrant or have to if give it a second look given new evidence proving it wasn't me. I know you usually are not supposed to answer any questions but I was and am genuinely interested in finding who really did this and in protecting anyone from this person or these types of actions by anyone to anyone. The police's logic up to that point was absolutely unhinged so I thought any kind of logic would help. Upon getting the police reports months later they are saying the person simply said that yes they were me when asked by my ex if it was me. They also are saying it is me because the person mentioned the pregnancy and her and I were the only ones that could possibly know about that (6 months later, after I had vented to many about it in a healthy way and after she could have told anyone) or talk the way the ""Jason"" talked to her. I was arrested none the less, I had unsecured bail that time, but immediately I began to become completely afraid and victimized. No one had advice for me to protect myself from further arrests and that stress has not stopped to this day to the point it is getting very problematic for my mental and physical health even though the arrests have finally stopped (after a 2nd and 3rd), I'm traumatized. I am starting to see a doctor but do not have insurance so that makes this all more stressful to the point where I have really never felt lower in my life or more afraid. The stress makes it hard to mount the kind of courage I need to take this on. It's a real shame that I have a support team and am still feeling defeated. I hate to think about the weak ones in our society. Weeks later at the arraignment I was told I was being arrested again for the very same thing, again without being talked to. Again the same profile. My worst fear that they would keep doing it had came true and no one had or has any answers to this day. Bail was secured and we decided to pay the whole thing which was thousands of dollars. Whoever impersonated me (or still is) is definitely getting the best of me. I thank anyone who is reading because it's been hard to vent on social media due to the sensitive nature and I tend to cry very badly if I talk about the way I REALLY feel in person so this is the first time I've been able to tell a fuller side of the story to anyone outside my family and a couple close friends but even than I try be brave to not stress them even though I am terrified. I'm worried my lawyer won't have me testify and I'll be railroaded and never heard, locked up and have the key thrown away for something I didn't do and given a ""life sentence"" of harassment from this person to get me in trouble whenever they want. I have a good lawyer and I have confidence in him but there's so much more at stake here than just my criminal defense and I saw that from the start. That's why I'm here is to find a lawyer that feels passionately or specializes in civil rights. No one should ever be arrested for such flimsy evidence, Facebook should be giving them information to actually catch the person, or someone higher up in cyber crime should be involved to do WHATEVER needed to really catch this person as red handed as possible. Bottom line is the police are not doing their job and this is a common problem between me and my ex. Facebook is not doing their job SO FAR and it's been over 7 months or longer. AND it didn't end there! Months later I was contacted again by the police as the impersonator was harassing her again. But this time they didn't have an arrest warrant yet and I had an air tight alibi under cameras and without my phone so they did not arrest me. 2 days later the same police department arrested me again without calling, without looking into the events 2 days prior, simply based on the links to the account based on the previous arrests. This time ""Jason"" said used an escalated threat and a new charge was added. I believe they were trying to Swat me. Bail was through the rough this time, nearly $10k cash. None of the police officers were educated in what Swatting is. I don't know who gets bailed out over and over again and pays cash bail just to do something they know they would get arrested for again, it just doesn't make any sense to me at all. Its been hell on my family. Before I left the police station I went up and asked the front desk for help as my fear was setting into full blown panic of going home just to be arrested again. They had no answers. My criminal lawyer helped the arrests stop after that but I have no idea whether or not the actual harassment has stopped other than to guess because they have not told me about arresting anyone else for it; meaning that the person is still free to do it, and I'm not sure what would make them stop. I have tried to avoid thinking about who exactly it could be ""Jason"" so I don't go crazy but I thought about the motivations. They either don't like me, or her, or both, and there are all sorts of people who could fit that description and also know about our situation and details about our lives in the 6 months between the break up and the incident. I need all the help I can get. I'm scared. I want the person responsible caught and brought to justice. I wonder if the only way to do that is with a good civil rights lawyer who perhaps has dealt with a similar case, Swatting, or with Facebook I have ways to borrow money to pay whatever but it is straining me and adding to the stress and victimization. I really think that I have a strong case to win some money for having my rights violated like this. When I did a search here on Reddit I'm not the only one who has incurred loses from someone impersonating them on Facebook. I want to make sure this doesn't happen again and the person is caught but if I should be compensated I want to know if that's something that I should start now. If I should do anything to get this in the public eye and court of public opinion or anything to prevent it from happening to anyone in my state or in the country again I want to know. Any advice at all is appreciated. Thank you for your time. It feels great to get this out and I'm sure I will have some great advice soon. Your helping a man who feels completely broken. Your helping my ex who is a Single mom with a son get justice. Your helping my family and anyone else drug into this as support. P.S. and putting up with any grammar errors as I'm stressed thinking about this and it's late. I will proof read again tomorrow. Thank you all. Spread Love and Peace. Sincerely,"

I sold software in the internet using a canadian company I founded together with a random canadian I met in the internet. I live in germany. Two years ago, I was raided by the BKA (german FBI), but they closed the case without a penalty but told me to stop this shit, what I obviously did. I came clean with myself, stopped developing software and just lived my life, but a few weeks ago my canadian partner sent a link to a Notice of Violation by the crtc (canadian police?) that charges me at least $50 000 because they classify the software I developed as malware. I haven't received any paperwork yet, all my information come from this internet document. Obviously they have my real name, address, etc. I don't really know how to react. Is it possible for Canada to charge me with something the german police already investigated? We founded the business together using a partnership agreement my parents had to sign because I wasn't even 18 when we started this. Obviously I can't pay the charges."

I signed an NDA between myself and another individual about not disclosing information about him to others (no intellectual property or anything like that). He's now wanting to take me to court for breaching the NDA. I lost my copy and he is refusing to give me another copy if the signed one he has. Is there any way I am obligated to receive a copy simply by asking him or is it more complicated than that? He is also asking for a settlement rather than going to court. I know I can't really ask how enforceable this nda is without a copy of it so I won't bother. This is the last email I received about the situation: ""You were provided a copy, I do not have to legally provide another copy not do I care to sympathize with you. I have all the proof that I need that you agreed to sign it and did. Ill have my lawyer reach out to you in the next 24hrs if available. Also, here is the settlement option. I also just want to let you know, if I have to waste my time, Im going for everything. I asked you to stop and leave me alone and you crossed the line. Settlement Agreement: -$1250 for damages (photographs without consent, public slander, breaking contract of nda) due within 72 hours post agreement (if not paid 'plaintiff's name' will continue with court &amp; contact of chain of command. Charges will include harassment, cyber bullying, defamation of character, intentionally &amp; maliciously disclosing an intimate image of another person without their consent, breaching of contractual agreement (NDA)). -signed cease and desist ('defendants name' ceasing all communication and contact involving 'plaintiff's name') -continuation of agreed NDA or Cease &amp; Desist, if 'defendant's name' chooses to break contract there will be a $10,000 award to 'plaintiff's name' paid from 'defendent's name' as well as coverage of all court &amp; legal fees. If you are not agreeing to the settlement. Please do not contact me."" He initially emailed me saying I had three options to pick from how to handle this and I said court. Then he responded with he wants a settlement instead. I don't know where he's getting these numbers from seeing as he has not been monetarily damaged in any way. The NDA was something he drafted up on like rocketlawyer or something like that. I'll answer any questions as best as I can. Thank you in advance! Also here's this: Washington law about disclosing intimate images. I don't think the picture in question falls into the description of an intimate image as worded here since the only nudity is buttocks, the face is not visible, and there are no visible tattoos or markings on the rest of the body that would clearly give away who the person in the picture is.

(5) It shall be an affirmative defense to a violation of this section that the defendant is a family member of a minor and did not intend any harm or harassment in disclosing the images of the minor to other family or friends of the defendant.

I haven't gotten ""in trouble"" for it, *per se*, but the whole ordeal made me look bad to my coworkers and upper management and it's caused me to lose friends. (For separate reasons, management is refusing to listen to my explanation that I simply didn't do it, which I can prove that I didn't.) I reported the fake profile to Facebook and they deleted it *and notified the account owner* (not me- in fact, I have strong reason to believe it's the same guy who said I was harassing him), but won't tell me who that account owner is. Since then, the harassing messages that ""I"" was apparently sending my coworker have completely stopped (as far as I know, since I don't talk to him anymore). The only way to get that information is via a request from a judge / law enforcement, and because it technically is a ""cyber crime,"" it falls under the FBI's jurisdiction. But because there's no threat to life or property, they're not likely to take a complaint seriously (and yes, I already filed one). I'm wondering if I could bring this to a judge and request an injunction against harassment in order to get Facebook to reveal who created the fake account, even though the harassment has technically already stopped. My end game is (provided I'm right about everything) is to file harassment complaints via HR against the guy I suspect is behind all this (and maybe a defamation lawsuit), as well as HR complaints against upper management for not taking this seriously. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! (I filed this under criminal law bc nothing else seemed to fit as well, but I'm more than happy to re-label it if it's deemed to fit better elsewhere!)"

I have tried using PornHubs content removal form however Im in an endless loop of automated reply/copy paste emails from their support team asking me to file a DCMA removal however it is not a copyright issue. I have filed a police report and I havent been able to get in contact with the person that posted the videos however the situation is being investigated because he has obviously committed a crime. In the mean time, I would like the videos taken down but according to their form, it is in relation to copyright works and not cyber sexual harassment. Theyve been completely unhelpful. Does anyone have a suggestion on what to do? Should I call the police again and ask them to request a removal?

I did something stupid and fortunately, I stopped doing it the second time. Going back a few weeks ago, I was on a website (I won't mention it) looking to ask girls to make content videos. And before I proceed with anything, I always ask their age, because I take that seriously, no matter where they are from. So I go to this one girl, and I ask her age and ask if she wanted to make a video for me. She agreed to do it, I paid her and did not hear from her for a few days. Only thing I got was a pic of her bottom. So, I deleted my gmail account because I have been scammed before and I was tired of it. &amp;#x200B; A few days later, I get an email from paypal from someone, asking to give her extra money. I get confused at first then found out it was the girl I hired to do it. She said she did the video with extra stuff, but with what I didn't ask her for. She kept pleading and asking me to give her an extra $20 dollars, and I said no because I told her I already paid to what we agreed on, and I never asked for extra stuff on the video. This is where I should have stopped talking to her. &amp;#x200B; She threats me to expose my information and says she got it. I'll admit, I was scared, because I have never been blackmailed with girls making video content. She kept pushing me until I actually gave in. She even upped the price to $50 dollars. I had to ask someone for money because I was scared. I didn't know what was going to happen if she would actually do that. So I paid her, and she said it was the wrong account, and demanded me to pay her again. I didn't want to, so I paid her another $70 dollars. I'm an idiot. I pay her and she promises she will delete all my information. I took her word for it. Today she sends another request for $120 dollars. I was scared a little but then actually laughed. I knew she was scamming me. So I told her I wasn't going to pay and if she kept doing it, she would report me and use my information for united scams or something like that. She kept begging and kept sending requests and it was annoying. So I decided to stall her while I had to delete my gmail accounts with sites i signed up for, just in case. She kept going on how I broke the law and how I was a sexual pervert asking young girls for videos, then changing her story saying that she was a minor and i was a rapist and stuff like that.... The face is that she agreed to do it, and she was of age. I always ask if they are 18 or older. If not, I don't do business with them. She's 22 years old, if you wanted to know. She said other stuff like she has an uncle who was an agent and was going to report her to him. &amp;#x200B; Finally I just sent her a message saying that I wasn't going to pay her, and I have her info and if she were to do something stupid, I would report her to the cyber crime division. I'm ok with it now, but I need to know, would she actually do something like that? And if she did, should I report her? I have her email. The thing is, she's in venzuela and I am in the us, so I don't know the laws about that. Truth is I never got the video and I didn't want it, and I could have done a chargeback, but I deleted my paypal account as well. If you need to know I am 28 years old, and as far as I know, we were both consenting adults who agreed to do something, but she never followed through.."

I added him to talk to him about something, related to his girlfriend (now ex). I now discover his message he sent me before I blocked him (that I didn't see). [This](URL the message. The top message in this is the message he sent before. At first I was like wow okay not cool but whatever but now that I read it again, that's pretty fucking heavy, isn't it?

(more illegal acts)",0,ce4y4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ce4y4d/girls_i_know_on_twitter_getting_catfished/,2019-07-17 09:38:04,"Okay, so, I need some help with this. Basically, there is this 17 year old male on Twitter who pretends to be a girl (used another girl's pictures) to try &amp; woo other LGBTQ+ girls. They do it extremely well. He tries to get them into a relationship with them &amp; get nudes from them. Then, when they find out, he has sent one girl in particular death threats. He has gone to multiple Twitter accounts and reposted nudes of these girls ALL over the platform. He was multiple accounts so he can run away from reporting. Last night, the main girl he still targets and gives death threats, she almost committed suicide because he reposted her nudes for everyone to see. He thinks he can get away with this, because he is technically still a minor. And most of the girls he has tricked and manipulated into giving him their pictures, are either one year older than him or maybe a few years older than him. The main girl he keeps attacking, I got in touch with her several times. She did tell me that he has tricked underaged girls as well but they don't want to come forward/are too humiliated and traumatized by what he's done. &amp;#x200B; So, I know he has committed crimes. I know these are criminal acts. I have some evidence of it, but not all of it. The one girl I have been speaking to about this, who almost ended her life over him, has a LOT on him. I myself am not a victim of him, I inserted myself into the situation because, before I knew these accounts were the catfish, they were also in my DMs, probably hoping to trick me as well, (even though I'm in a relationship). The death threats, impersonation, reposting illegal pictures of his victims, reposting without permission, cyber bullying. &amp;#x200B; What can I do about this if all the victims choose not to come forward? Can I still report him to authorities as a bystander, watching all of this unfold? Could I still go to my local police station and at least give him his name and face and tell them ""he is committing crimes on the internet""? What can I do to help these girls? Some of them are one year older or a little older than him, and some of them are completely underaged but I don't know who those girls are. I feel as though, I can't just sit here and do nothing when this is going to continue; I gave him a warning to his main account myself, and he blocked me. He thinks that I'm bluffing about trying to find a way to turn him in. The older girls are afraid to, because they think they will be arrested for giving him nudes and being older than him, because 17 is still technically a minor. Even though, they thought he was a girl their age. One girl told her parents but her parents basically shut her down and told her that it would get HER in trouble, and not him. Could this be true, even if they had no idea and thought this guy was a girl their exact age? Or would he still get in trouble for the chaotic crime he has caused to these poor girls? &amp;#x200B; Fortunately, I have his name and the state he lives in. One of the victims gave it to me. And everyone knows his face because it was too easy to also find his YouTube, where he posted a video of himself. I don't know anything about Pennsylvania laws about catfishing for nudes, reposting them, and about death threats. &amp;#x200B; I really need help on this, any advice would really help. I just feel like I can't let this keep going on. Even if he is 17, he could be detained for this, right? Or if I could tip the police about him, and have them find out what else is on his computer that is illegal; I'm very worried about this guy. The victims are TOO SCARED to get justice/turn him into the police. And I don't think it's good to wait until he's 18 in order to report him. Also, yes, I have reported ALL of his Twitter posts as I could before I got blocked; Twitter has done nothing about him and his multiple accounts. Please, what can I do? I'm a 23 year old woman who knows about this situation and I want to protect these victims from anymore trauma and harassment. And I also want to prevent this guy from ever tricking another LGBTQ+ girl again, into giving him what he wants from them. Could this also be considered a hate crime against lesbian/bi girls and women? &amp;#x200B; So, yeah, just anything you can give advice on, it would really, really help me. And these victims. I know he will not stop, so yeah."

I just divorced my husband after finding out that he had been cheating on me and my parents were really upset with me because 'marriage is forever' according to Christian belief and that we should have gone to couple therapy instead. I flew to Bali on vacation after hearing about this spiritual guru who has supposedly helped a lot of people spiritually find their inner peace. He taught me how to meditate and to control my emotions. We met almost everyday and very soon grew very close. He convinced me that to allow him to 'fully' help me, I had to reveal everything about myself to him. In other words, I must not be afraid of being vulnerable around him. And likewise, he revealed some of his biggest secrets to me, one of which was how unhappy he really was with his wife who can not satisfy his needs as a man. I told him I was still feeling hurt by my husband's betrayal and did not know if I could ever fall in love again. He told me that my pain would render me unable to love or feel loved ever again if I let it. He asked me to open up to him more and that's when he began to manipulate my feelings and emotions. He made me believe that to be able to go back to my former-self pre-divorce, I need to re-learn how to love a man again. And he was willing to sacrifice himself for me to practice doing just that by pretending to love him, as in getting intimate with him emotionally and physically. It was as if I did myself a favour by having sex with him. Sure there were days when I asked myself if he was really helping me or only taking advantage of me. But he managed to convince me that I was a wounded soul and it was the only way I could heal. Then I learnt from 2 other women that I was not special to him at all. They too had been manipulated and tricked into having sex with him. I was horrified. When I confronted him about it he got really upset and acted as if I had just offended him and even told me to leave if I no longer trusted him. I felt so used and betrayed because I trusted him. The next day he came looking for me to see me but I refused to see him. He started sending me a rant of angry messages calling me a whore and weak woman, that nobody's gonna love me because I am not attractive enough. He even said that I was lucky that such a respectable and honourable man like him was generous enough to fuck me. I was really hurt and offended but decided I no longer wanted to associate myself with him. I proceeded to warn some other women about him and advised them to stay away from him before it's too late. When he heard about this, he got furious. He rang me up to tell me to stop spreading rumours about him and that he could finish me off easily if he wanted to. When I threatened to report him to the authority, he laughed and said nobody's going to believe me since I had no proof and the other women told me that they had reported him a few times but somehow he always escaped prosecution because of his good reputation among the local and his connection with the government. I asked these women to come forward together and report him but they told me there was no use. People would only think we were making things up and we could even go to jail for false accusation. One woman has even been banned from returning to Bali for 'forging a false rape allegations' against him. There was nothing I could do at the time so I flew back home though still felt bitter and angered about the whole thing. Two months ago, I stumbled upon a Bali Facebook Tourism page and saw his thread there advertising himself as a spiritual guru to lure more victims into his web I believe. So I decided to post a thread and reveal his true identity there. Other women followed suit. I heard his practice has been suspended over allegations of rape, sexual abuse and harassment. And I thought it's for the best. But some women, who had never had any bad experience with him have come to his defense, calling me a liar and telling me it was such a dick move since I have no right to post his picture there and if I felt that he had harassed or abused me sexually I should report him, instead of exposing him on an online forum where people can say whatever they want to say regarding if it's true or not. And also some say he can sue me for posting his picture online without consent. I am not really familiar with how cyber crime rules are implemented so I need to have some insights on it from law enforcement's perspective."

My email service has documented these instances and notified me, allowing me to secure my email and change my password without giving the unauthorized party access. They have also provided me with the IP address of the device that attempted the unauthorized access. Steps that I have taken and their outcomes: 1) Use a third party service to determine details about the IP I obtained. The perpetrator is located in Los Angeles, CA. Additional information cannot be obtained without paying massive service fees or an official request from police. 2) Contacted cyber crimes division of the LAPD. A detective told me that since I, the victim, am in Portland, OR, I need to file a police report with Portland PD. 3) Go to the police station in Portland, OR to file a report. They said I can only file a report online. 4) Go to file the police report online. There is no adequate category online to describe my situation. Click on ""Other,"" and it says I need to file the report in person. 5) Contact non-emergency services for clarification on how to file the report. They said to use the category of ""theft"" online. 6) Try again online. The ""theft"" category is completely irrelevant to this incident and virtually impossible to fill out given the circumstances. Almost all questions it asks are not applicable. So, how do I document and report this crime? It's only a matter of time before whoever is doing this gets my new password and finds a way to circumvent the gmail security features. Everyone I spoke to (except the cyber crimes detective in CA) was so apathetic I even started to doubt whether it was a crime to access someone else's email. I looked it up, and a crime has in fact occurred."

The electricity in that house is never on, and their garbage piles up because they cant pay their bill. I found the owner of the propertys email through the internet and sent her an email addressing mine and the neighborhoods concerns, funny enough she is a drug addiction counselor and works for a rehab consoling center. she replied that they are squatters and that she has tried to have them evicted but was told that they have squatters rights? Which makes no sense, if she the owner of the property wants them out and she filed correctly with the Sheriffs, those squatters would be gone. I send her another email telling her that I will be in touch with local law enforcement and let them know what she has told me so maybe they can help further, at this point she responds that I am cyber stalking her and that I need to cease and desists all contact with her. So obviously, she is lying to me and possibly protecting the people that live there? I know that her daughter lives there, too.

I have not slept in about 36 hours doing as much research as I can while trying my best to stay calm but my mind is racing and I am trying to keep a panic attack at bay. &amp;#x200B; Yesterday, two accounts were made on two separate porn sites (that I was able to find) by a stranger (Ill call him X) with explicit nude photos of me as the profile pic, cover photo, as well as videos of me and my boyfriend. The first video was posted 17 hours before the second one, and not at once. I have reason to believe X has many videos and photos of me and may be taking his time posting these... &amp;#x200B; A random guy on Facebook reached out to me last night (March 3) under a profile that seems fake (throwaway likely), informing me that they found a video of me on a porn site with many tags and my full name disclosed in the title. He sent me this message about 23 hours after the first upload. He attached a link to the message, and wished me well. At first glance this seemed like a well meaning stranger, but after more thought its suspicious to me that this guy was able to find a video so soon with about 100 or so views.. however the second video he didn't send me (I found it through X's profile of me on the porn site) already had thousands of views after a couple hours of upload. These photos and videos he found were never posted online anywhere, never on my iCloud, Google Drive, Dropbox etc. They \*may\* have been sent over iMessage to my boyfriend two years ago from an old phone that was traded in by a smaller Verizon phone store my family has been going to for years, which I cannot access (or was not able to successfully figure out how). My guess is that it was hacked from my iMessages then, or from my phone that was traded in then sold to a third party for parts or something. The phone guys ""wiped"" it after I traded it in but I dont know if it was thorough... I feel incredibly, incredibly stupid for potentially letting myself be vulnerable to this situation by sending photos like that through iMessage. I'm trying to press those feelings down so I can try and be productive. What I've done: I no longer have access to the original videos or photos, so I took screenshots of the images and entire web page, downloaded the videos and took screenshots of everything I could think of to get evidence. &amp;#x200B; I have called the city sheriff who came to my house, who was of no real help. We filed an incident report, but if anything the man I talked to made jokes about the situation and made light of it and just didn't understand the seriousness of this situation. While I was trying my best to form sentences while uncontrollably shaking in front of him. He said my best bet is basically to just get over it and ""try to hire a PI or something."" I've also reached out to [URL and I am waiting for a response. I've reported and flagged the videos to the porn sites and it was taken down, only to find it reuploaded a couple hours later on the same website. I talked to a Digital Forensics Investigator (found on Yelp) on the phone who gave me some advice and to go to the Sheriffs office, ask for the detective that handles cyber crime and say I have a case that violates penal code 647J4. He said to not take no for an answer, and to get a search warrant from the detective to get the IP address from the website of the poster (and hope its not a public IP address...) get a physical location hopefully and send X cease and desist? And that the police will handle it from there... Is there anything else I can do Reddit to nip this in the bud as soon as possible? Should I shut down all of my social media? I want to act with as much urgency as possible and it is so frustrating that everyone I have talked to does not share in that same feeling. I am terrified that while I wait for paperwork, and wait to hear back from people that these videos will blow up, and I know in worst case scenarios some videos get millions of views overnight. "

And the police are taking her word for it. Long story short, I'm currently in a court battle against physco. She has had two restraining orders on me simply because she saw me in public. The police decide to do a forensic download on my iPhone, which has taken over TWO WEEKS. I've been using a temporary phone to stay in contact with everyone until then. I still don't have it back. The thing is, they did a download on physco's phone too. She turned her phone in after days of convincing, and got it back in a timely manner. I turned my phone in the second the judge ordered it. Physco allegedly hired a private investigator who did her download and found nothing on her phone. Physco's PI is also doing the download on my phone. Personally, I believe he could be keeping it just to piss me off. Or maybe he's planting evidence. Physco's mom once told me straight to my face that she ""knows people that will get me arrested"". It's a little fishy to me. Physco knows she's lying, she truly just wants to ruin my life. All I need to know now is why the hell is my download taking so long when hers was done in a split second? I have a job. A family to keep in touch with and without a phone it's been pretty difficult. This surely can't be right. I just need advice, because I'm not sure how much more I can take."
70,cyber-crime,legaladvice,[UPDATE]I think my 12yo daughter is being groomed online (WA State),1,a5jiku,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a5jiku/updatei_think_my_12yo_daughter_is_being_groomed/,2018-12-13 03:11:55,"I have reviewed the entire chat history between my daughter and this guy. It goes on and on and on. She has been participating in video chats with him and sending pictures at his request. They were talking about meeting up in the future so they could have sex. There is some Master/slave type conversation as well. Does the fact that there was video and pictures being sent as well as the BDSM-type play change anything? A deputy from my local sheriff's office called me yesterday. He said there's nothing to be done unless she specifically told him she was a minor/under 16. I can show him pages and pages of chat history where she makes it very clear that she's a kid, and if he met her he would see that she's definitely not mature enough to pass for over 16 (or over 18), and since I now know they've been video-chatting, he knows she's not over 16 either. He, like the commenters on my previous post, was more interested in providing parenting advice than addressing my very specific questions. The burden of proof is on the victim, he advised me, and while that may be true in his mind that does not sit well with me - so I have contacted my county prosecutor directly. I have been in contact with Discord. I have also submitted online reports to the police department in the area where he lives, the FBI, the NCMEC, and the cyber crime tipline for his area. So far, only Discord has responded and they have been helpful so far. Parenting wise, since I know you're going to ask, she is allowed to have her flip phone during the day for emergency purposes. There is no more online access at home. She is grounded, but she is grounded for lying to us about accessing websites she was specifically told not to do, not for sex chat. I haven't exploded at her, and neither has her dad. I am going to discuss the legal ramifications of what she's done with her this afternoon - she needs to know that this was illegal, it's not her fault - she got caught up in it and didn't know; but she also needs to know that she can get in big trouble for this kind of stuff both legally and physically. This guy isn't her boyfriend, he doesn't have her best interests at heart, and she's one step away from being sold into prostitution. We have an acquaintance who I was just informed was charged with a felony for sending nudes to a guy she met online. She's only a little older than my daughter. The deputy told me to call a child sexual assault advocacy center, so I think I'm going to do that. "

I recently quit a startup where the CEO was blatantly lying to the investors. I'm less concerned about that, the investors have seen little value creation and understand that he's a bozo. However, a few months ago the company was the victim of a cyber attack where the bad guys got away with essentially the equivalent of the previous year's revenue. A lot of money for a small startup (25 ppl). The bad guys owned our network and could easily - if they wanted - have placed backdoors or malicious code in our software solution. Worse, the startup is a so-called 'cybersecurity' startup, but they're clueless about security. They sell their solution to large enterprises, including banks, telecoms, governments and more. The CEO has covered up the crime to save face - if word got out that they were the victim of a large cyberattack, their reputation - and the company - would be dead. The 3rd party in the cyber-attack - the distributor acting on behalf of a large national telecom (the startup's client) - is also keeping quiet for, I assume, the same reasons. I'm sure the failure to disclose a cyberattack would violate law in California and Europe (GDPR). The client is in Europe. Additionally, the client now has software inside their network that is potentially adulterated and a vector for attacking large enterprises. This is what cybersecurity people talk about when they talk about supply chain threats, and it's being installed in the telecom's network, and will be installed elsewhere. My former company has no intention of doing an investigation or code audit to see if this occurred. I think cybersecurity should be taken very seriously and while I understand that the startup founders are fighting to keep the company alive, I don't feel good that my former bozo employers purport to be cybersecurity experts while allowing themselves to be a massive potential security threat. At the very least I think the CEO should be removed. The investors also have othe, large and successful cybersecurity companies in their portfolio that could potentially take a reputation hit. Advice and thoughts appreciated. "

Before I get into it I would like to preface by saying I am an alcoholic, and I will be admitting myself into treatment today for the next 60 days. So I would appreciate it if you could reserve your judgments because yes, what I am about to divulge is an incredibly evil thing to do. Basically I got really drunk on this particular night, like sloppy drunk. I had been into a couple minor arguments with a user of a forum in the past. I don't know him in real life, and he doesn't know me. We just argued briefly over differing perspectives before, and on this night he caught me when I was irrationally angry. I then proceeded to spam him with abusive PMs (private messages) over and over again throughout the course of that night. I know some of you may be thinking, ""Well that's not bad at all"". Well, when I looked back upon sober reflection, I was appalled. I didn't threaten to hurt the guy, but I sent him two long essays in separate messages trying my hardest to explain to him why he's a waste of life and should feel bad about himself. THEN, after those first two messages went out, I sent him a comprehensive list of specific, well-thought-out reasons why he is a waste of life. The list was so long and specific that it spanned over 3 more messages. It was message after message of intense, often times disturbing, line-crossing verbal and emotional abuse. Disparaging him and ridiculing him for personal traits that he had posted about before (his weight, his job, his girlfriend leaving him, etc). I never told him to commit suicide or harm himself, but I heavily insinuated that it wouldn't make a difference if he was dead or alive. I can't believe some of the sentences that I typed out. I couldn't even believe it was me. Horrible, toxic, nasty and vile attacks on his character and chastising him for things he can't control. For example, one of the messages had a section where I told him ""if he didn't have such a tiny and ineffective male appendage, his girlfriend might have been able to overlook his terrible sense of humor and lack of personal hygiene and try to white-knuckle the relationship for another couple of months."" Or there was also a part in there where I told him he disgusts me and he ""deserves to be in jail for the amount of emotional duress he puts his mom under every day for making her wake up and keep being his mom"". I promptly sent him one final PM, where I apologized and explained to the best of my ability why I lashed out with such abhorrent and sickening messages. He hasn't replied, and I don't expect him to. The best thing I can hope for is that the poor guy isn't taking anything I said to heart, and his day isn't ruined. The only thing is, I know there are some cyber-bullying laws that exist. Is anything I did specifically a crime that I could be looking at a punishment for? I already know I'm banned from said forum, but I mean legally speaking. Could I be fined or placed under arrest?

73,cyber-crime,legaladvice,What can be done retroactively about an online scam?,1,a0w5sq,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a0w5sq/what_can_be_done_retroactively_about_an_online/,2018-11-28 03:03:47,"(UK) Hi, my girlfriend has recently been the victim of some online fraud and I was wondering if anybody here had any information on what would be the best move. We have contacted the bank and Fraud UK but it doesn't seem like much will be done via that avenue. Is it worth contacting the regular police separately? Is there some sort of cyber crime task force or group that would be worth contacting? I honestly have no idea how these things are supposed to go, but based on what we've done and looked up so far, you get caught by one of these scams, you are basically screwed and there isn't really any options in regards to finding justice or compensation? I will give some background on what happened, please don't say how silly she was to fall for the scam, we are both aware of this. I think if I was with her at the time I would have realised something was up, and to be honest I think in most cases she would have too, but it just came at the perfect time and slipped past her for a second until it was too late. She is really sad and embarrassed about it. Basically, we moved into a new house 4 days ago (our first mortgage) and she had one of those fancy beds with the TV at the bottom in her old house. It was too heavy to take with us so she put it on Gumtree for 400. Someone offered to buy it but said they would pay 700 via paypal so that she could pay 300 to a courier. That seems suspect straight away because why couldn't they just pay the courier themselves, but like I said she was in a rush to get rid of the bed, and excited about the prospect of the Christmas presents she could buy people with the extra money, and all this happened over a few minutes so it just didn't even enter her head to be suspicious. So then she gets an email from ""paypal"" saying that she's received 700 and it has a note from the sender reminding her to pay the courier (and some bank details). So she transfers the 300 to the account given, then obviously realises there is no money in her paypal and the email was fake. Called the bank, they said they'd look into it and update us, but basically said if the person removed the funds from their account straight away, there's nothing they could do as it can't be traced to whatever account they sent it to next (which is dumb in itself, all digital money is traceable and most ATMs are seen by a CCTV camera). It's been 24 hours since we called the bank and I assume if the money was in the account they would have called back by now so it looks like the bank can't help at all. Contacted Fraud UK next who are supposed to investigate these things, but they haven't called back either. I know it could have been avoided with a little more caution but my girlfriend is a really hard working mental health nurse and just a generally incredible person, and she was SO happy when she thought she'd sold that bed, just to buy some better Christmas presents for people since we're both broke after moving. The idea of someone doing this to her makes me rage out so bad. She's just plain sad and embarrassed. What finally seemed to put the nail in the coffin of hope was, I googled the email address of the person that scammed her and he/she's been doing this to people successfully since 2009, including on websites intended for selling useful equipment and aids to disabled people. If they have done it on the same email address for that long, I assume it's because they have absolutely zero fear of reprisal. I wonder if anyone knows of any further steps we can take outside the bank and Fraud UK? Are there international groups/police hotlines to investigate this sort of thing? We have emails and everything to prove it, as well as the details of the bank the money they went to, so it surely shouldn't be hard for the police to find who the person is? That seems wishful thinking based on how long this scammer seems to have been operating, but I mean, it wouldn't be hard for the police to find somebody if they had proof they had stolen something and the only information they had on that person was there bank account details right? And we have those details and that proof so...."

I was filling a civil suit against someone who owes me money and I did not have her full address. You need a defendant's address to file a small claims suit in CA. So, I started asking around on facebook if anyone knew her place of work or home address and made it very clear it was for civil lawsuit reasons only. I did not plan on physically appearing at her workplace or home; instead sending a friend or someone from the court to hand her the lawsuit. Preferably, the second option. A friend of hers responded to me with a fake facebook profile and threatened physical harm if I filled the lawsuit or continued searching for an address to file such suit. This ""friend"" falsely accused me of cyber stalking if I continued my suit. The profile went as far as to say the ""friend"" had written a police report and had informed my employer about my actions. I have spoken to several criminal defense lawyers and they have told me my actions are no where near cyber stalking or stalking charges. I was blatantly told no prosecutor in their right mind would file charges against me. Especially since I used a private detective to eventually find a work address. It just occurred to me- is threatening to file a false police report over a potential civil suit and threatening physical harm considered extortion in CA? I just researched the definition of extortion and the ""friend's"" actions seem to fit the bill. The profile threatened me in three different ways- to hit me, falsely accuse me of a crime, and claimed to have called my employer with the stalking accusations. The ""friend"" not only said this in a phone conversation. I have it in writing via text messages. Yes- text messages. I was seriously freaking out. The ""friend"" called me at like 10pm out of the blue and was very threatening. Am I a victim of extortion because I never filled the suit and agreed with the ""friend"" over the phone I wouldn't follow through. This was in July. I figured out who the ""friend"" is BTW. I actually have evidence to support my findings. Can someone please help me? Again, I'm in CA. Am I victim of a crime? Thank you."

My employer switched to all digital payroll about a year or so ago. I was fine with the change, it would make keeping track of my pay stubs much easier. However, back in July someone was able to gain unauthorized access to my account (must have gotten hold of my password somehow) and was able to change my direct deposit information to their bank information and effectively steal my entire paycheck (paid bi-weekly, so 40 hours worth) by having it direct deposited into their bank account. I didnt catch it until the day after when I noticed I was missing funds. Alerted my employer and filed a police report immediately. We even contacted ADP, the company that handles be digital payroll and they practically said theres nothing they can do, which I dont believe because they have to have insurance in case this kind of thing happens, right? Anyways, I gave the police my statement and was even able to retrieve the bank account number and routing number they used and have that to the police aswell. (Yes, that is ALL VISIBLE on my online account, so they were able to see MY information before they changed it also.) Today I received a call from the police department saying they put a court order in to the bank to see whos account it was that stole my money and the bank said the account wasnt found, likely already closed out, right? So Im basically out of an entire paycheck and I was already struggling before this happened. (Wife lost job, sob story, etc.) Whoever gained unauthorized access to my account was, in addition to being able to change my direct deposit information, able to view tax documents from the previous year which has my address AND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER ON THEM. Putting me at high risk for identity theft. And they were able to access all this AND change my direct deposit information with JUST GAINING ACCESS TO MY ACCOUNT. No EMAIL asking if this was me, no phone call, no second step authentication, NOTHING. I have called several lawyers in my area and all I have reached out to have told me that their area of expertise is not cyber crime (which this apparently is.) So, is that just it? Im just out of a paycheck someone stole from me?"

If a **mod** here wants to reach out to me for the link to verify i'm not looking for karma, that might be reasonable but other than that I don't think posting the link is right thing to do. **My legal question is how do I report this without being involved in an investigation and what are my legal rights when it comes to wanting to stay out of an official investigation**? I don't think the FBI is gonna raid my house but I also want to make sure it actually gets looked into and not lost in a huge queue of other fake things. The people in the video are clearly speaking English and can be identified so it seems ridiculous to let it sit with other less obviously solvable crimes. To just cut to the chase, the video depicts a woman in some sort of BDSM suffocation torture device. In the beginning the situation seems consensual but little more than halfway through the video she essentially screams that she wants to be let out. She literally says ""I mean it"". It's just clearly not acting. You can see the moment she realizes the guy behind the camera doesn't care she tried to end the scene. She screams for over a minute and fights hard to get out, (i mean she tries to rip herself out). Then she just passes out and even after that he keeps her in the thing for a little bit longer before opening it. She doesn't die on camera, she's still breathing at the end of the video but she does not fully regain consciousness. I don't know what else to really say, it's just clearly not acting or faked. She fights it like someone who thinks there gonna die and she's still unconscious when it's all over. It's somehow been viewed around 30,000 times and it's still up. I didn't report it to PornHub right away because I can't live with the idea that it might just get deleted by a mod who doesn't care, without ever getting looked into. But also I'm a really young adult and don't want my shit confiscated by police because I can't afford to replace it. Obviously I wasn't on a sketchy site, PornHub is pretty mainstream, so I'm pretty sure I didn't do anything wrong but that's why i'm asking here to be sure what my rights are."

The training recommended that teachers contact their school admin and follow ""district procedures"". That can't be right. It's my understanding that in all US states public school teachers are mandated reporters and must call 911 for something like that because it's a sex crime involving a minor and so at least one felony and possibly multiple felonies in states where ""revenge porn"" is taken seriously. Just passing along what happened to ""school admin"" and ""following district procedures"" is not enough, as far as I understand it. But before I complain to the school that their online cyber bulling training is substandard, am I correct?

Florida has the Florida Mental Health Act of 1971, commonly referred to as the Baker Act. The TLDR of this is that a person can be detained for psychological evaluation if they prove they are a danger to themselves or others. Because this law is from 1971 it predates the internet by nearly 20 years. The way the law is written is that this law only applies to written and verbal communication, cyber communication falls outside of the law. BTW, notice I said detained, not charged. The Baker Act gives law enforcement, judges, physicians, and mental health professionals the tools to detain someone without charging them for a crime for the purpose to intervene in the case of a physicality emergency before a person hurts themselves or others. This detainment can last up to 72 hours and can end with a release or an involuntary admittance to receive treatment. The Parkland shooter had a file at the local FBI office where they were called to either his home or to his school to assist numerous times. There is documented evidence that he got on social media websites and left comments like, ""I aspire to be a school shooter,"" and ""I want to die shooting people with my AR-15."" Before being expelled, he was prohibited from being on school property with a backpack (ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!). The Broward County Sheriff, where the shooting took place, said that if the Baker Act included cyber communications this event could have been prevented. Instead, Florida passed a law banning high-capacity magazines (btw the Parkland shooter specifically used 10 round magazines because the 30 round magazines would not fit into his bag, how the fuck am I the only one who realizes the gravity of that statement, I've been shouting it since the shooting happened) and now they are pushing for a ban on the sale on all AR-15s. Noting has happened with the Baker Act, despite the County Sheriff where the shooting occurred pleading for this to happen. So here is my question. I live in Texas. Texas has the Texas' Health and Safety Code, but it lacks the teeth that the Baker Act does, and the Baker act lacks the language to use cyber communication as evidence towards ""involuntary examination."" How would a person in Texas get something like the Backer Act passed, or at least introduced, in Texas? Also, how would one push this on toward the federal level? Not for federal law enforcement only, but a federal law that is enforced by local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. Public health in abysmal in this country, and our psychiatric health is the worst of the group. Focusing on the tool will not prevent acts of violence from happening. One person killing 2 and wounding 5 with a tire iron (example) is only worse than the Parkland shooting in terms of scale. The fact is one is too many, regardless of the tool used. [URL [URL BTW the Baker Act was reformed in 2005 to amend the treatment methods, not to include cyber communication. "

So yesterday I got a random message from somebody on my friends list that starts off with this guy asking for help. he continues to tell me that he has virtual gift cards for Steam, but the only way he can receive them is to send them to me first, then I send them back. This struck my curiosity and I knew from the get-go that this was fishy. Being a regular ""kitboga"" (Look him up!) viewer I wanted to mess around with this person and see how far they would go. He told me that I would be sent two gift cards, one valued at $20 and the other at $100. Yeah, right... Well, everything escalated quickly after I sent him a burner email address. I actually got sent the gift cards. &amp;#x200B; So here is where my brain clicked and I realized that I may be aiding this person in Laundering gift cards with a stolen credit card. Just to clarify I never ""accepted"" or ""declined"" these gift cards, but they remain in my ""gifts"" tab and can be claimed any time. I also never agreed to help this person and never really expected them to send me anything. I was promised that if I continued with their offer that there would be more opportunities in the future. Pretty much at this point I stalled for a while as I tried to find a way to contact Steam Support. The longer i stalled the more antsy he got. This is where he realized I wasn't game for his plan. I was first threatened that I would have the police come for me and that I was going to jail. Wowzers. After continuous stalling I was then threatened with "" I will put a bullet in your ass"" and ""i will f\*\*k your family"" &amp;#x200B; At this point i'm really not concerned about this lowlife harming me, but I took precautions by calling the local non-emergency police department. They pretty much shrugged it off and gave me the # to the FBI cyber crime center. The phone number and the website don't really fit the criteria for what happened. Not only that, but I have no clue who this guys is other than his screenname. I am also awaiting a response from Steam because I put in a report for the account and explained everything. I also have the entire conversation documented. &amp;#x200B; My real concern is what to do with the virtual gift cards that are in limbo.

How and where do I report it to ensure a investigation happens?",2,9byqqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9byqqu/60m_ico_scam_uncovered_serial_perpetrators_and/,2018-09-01 10:07:07,"Feel like Im in a Hitchcock movie All started by trying to find out whats happening to a bad ICO investment and it points to what looks like network of criminal activity. I dont want to be involved but feel I better get the proper authorities to take this seriously and put these criminals where they belong. really looking for any help or advice what to do. ACChain and Puyin Coin were ICO scams from China. They took &gt; $60M USD (some estimates $100M+) of investor money, 6 arrests were made in Shenzhen China earlier this year, and most associated people disappeared. This was reported in Chinese media as Puyin Coin but the connection to ACChain wasnt made clear and it didnt get picked up outside China. Some links (google translate does an OK job) [URL [URL [URL &gt;""**Police also urged other fugitive suspects to surrender as soon as possible"".** Some not too bright or super greedy members of the project tried to keep the ACChain part of scam going even after the exit and arrests presenting on social media as everything is cool and they even tried to roll out a third new scam. # Genevieve Leveille and Serena Yin (admitted in own response and validated as the actual people) took control of the ACChain project around January 2018 around the time the original management fled but prior to the China arrests. [URL [URL [URL Leveille claimed on social media and at blockchain events to have raised $23M into a new related venture called Biolifechain.io. The detail of biolifechain would never justify even a $2M presale so it was either a lie or part of a scheme to launder some of the ACChain or Puyin Coin missing funds. [URL Leveille set up 3 new UK companies plus one in the tax haven of Jersey, and information suggests a number of others in Switzerland, Hong Kong and probably elsewhere. These new companies were all set up at around the same time China police were investigating and making arrests [URL [URL [URL [URL My original intention was to publish all the details we found online as a warning but the more I uncovered about this pair the more it looked like serious criminal activity that warrants a federal investigation probably in multiple countries. On top of obvious fraud and securities violations it seems to involve money laundering and tax evasion. I think it needs to be looked at urgently while there is still a fresh trail. No expectation of investors getting anything back but just stopping more people getting ripped off would be cool. Leveille, Yin and a group of their supporters (being investigated now and **soon to be named and shamed)** are also clearly not satisfied with what they took so far and are starting and participating in at least 9, **yes NINE other ICO scams**. Im not sure who or where (8 possible locations) to report this and really need local legal advice... PLEASE HELP! 1- Genevieve Leveille and Serena Yin both appear or appeared to live, work or study in the UK at least partially, and Leveille is a director of many UK companies and two ICOs and has addresses there. Doubtful they pay tax anywhere but UK should want to look at their tax. 2- Serena Yin appears to be Chinese national and the scams were original China based. China police (Nanshan District, Shenzhen and later Beijing) are already be engaged and made arrests but our PI advised us with that amount of money Police may have likely been paid to turn a blind eye for some perpetrators. 3- There is a potential money trail leading to Jersey (UK, not NY one) and a company called **ACChain Technology International Services** and Genevieve Leveille uses a number of Jersey addresses so may live or work there. There also appears to be legal action against Leveille in Jersey based on a notice in Jersey papers 4- Genevieve Leveille claims a US passport holder or citizen and many things she did are crimes in the states but we have nothing to link her to a US address, no credit history or employment. She put Columbia University on linkedin but could not be verified or find any photo or anything so probably faked. 5- There are lawsuits against Genevieve Leveille in Singapore and two of her latest ICO Scams appear to be based in Singapore and there were notices in singapore papers too 6- Many of the ACChain and Biolifechain related companies link back to Hong Kong 7- One of her ICOs seems to be Nigeria based and shes supposed to be from Nigeria but everyone knows the Nigeria police wont do anything. 8- The biolifechain ICO has many links and references to Switzerland and there have been a few pointers of money movement there. All this has been uncovered with just a few grand for a private Investigator, a bit of searching and many tips from people that read the thread and chipped in. We probably only see the tip of the iceberg and there may be many more scams and ICOs to find with a more effort. # Full Background Full disclosure, I got eyes on this shitshow because I invested a few grand in ACChain during the ICO phase mid 2017. I invest in a bunch of ICOs lost that sort of money a dozen times I would normally not give a shit. I took a close look of this first because of the fucked up responses they gave on Telegram when the project clearly had stalled or something wrong. Normally an exit scam completely disappear and a failed project will admit some difficulty. This was different. In July got invited to a private group of pissed off investors who showed evidence that valid questions were being censored. It was clear something was getting covered up. Since January 2018 it could be clearly seen in GIT (the public source code repository) that **no development** was going on, the team listed on the website apart from Leveille had not been seen or heard of in public for months, but social media kept posting that the project was still going strong and claiming faked awards and other stuff. There was no mention of anyone leaving, any trouble, hacking, nothing. They always said there will be a new release in a few weeks the developers are hard at work but this shit went on for over 6 months and you could see its a lie because nothing in GIT and nobody trading it. What really pissed me is the arrogant and dismissive way Leveille and her admin Robin dealt with investors. Frequently deleting critical posts and in one case referring to someone that asked questions as ***he is a small little man who should not have invested what he could ill afford to loose***. Well fuck that attitude when youre living high off the guys money, so in June I dropped a few more grand to get a Hong Kong PI to find out what really happened. The PI connected Puyin Coin owners directly to ACChain via a string of China and HK companies, found the offices which were hastily evacuated got photos, got a bunch of other details on the original team and other evidence clearly showing it all to be a multi part scam. Can read a lot more detail in the other posts. The PI did warn us that they were **threatened by mafia like people** in the course of this investigation. There is well over $60M USD taken so it is very likely some people they do not want to be uncovered and may have bribed China police already. The PI seriously advised us and the other investors to remain anonymous and avoid China. Consider the threats to be very serious even life threatening and this comes from a proper PI. I shared some the information I had with the investors and posted on reddit and **then things got interesting** [URL When the first empty office photos were posted (which are exactly the register China company offices) the ACChain Telegram admins (Wallace and Robin) tried to claim it was all FAKE NEWS and strongly insisted that the project was still going but could not substantiate a thing they said. When investors quizzed the ACChain social media team they were evasive or just blocked or censored the investor. This was so fucked up because they were clearly caught red handed, but they kept trying to keep the scam going for unknown reasons. Days later under pressure to give any evidence they finally posted old photos of the development team at work as their proof. Turned out (own admission) the social media team had never been to China or seen the actual office, they just got paid by Leveille and Yin to keep the social media going and had no connection to the devs or anyone. In the photo, our PI identified one former employee that they had interviewed in person, she had left ACChain in 2017, so the photo they were using as proof was old and proved the opposite. They were trying too hard to keep the cover up. Investors challenged the ACChain team to refute any of this with real evidence and they always got censored or blocked. ACChain were asked to post a video or anything to back up their story which would be so fucking easy if anything they said was true. The photos of the scammers and more of the details the PI dug up were then posted on reddit and got a lot of attention and thousand plus upvotes. [URL Then rather than disappear **Genevieve Leveille doubled down again** ACChain posted a hurried explanation on medium on August 10 and paid for it to be republished on a few blockchain websites, they try to say the details posted on reddit were factually incorrect and they tried to put up a cover story. But they gave no evidence other than a story, and if what they say is true it would be so easy to back it up with evidence. [URL [URL Leveille posted on twitter and even said this [\#Vote](URL up this article [\#help](URL put to [\#shame](URL [\#cowards](URL get the [\#truth](URL This explanation was transparent as fuck. It was immediately debunked and only sunk them deeper. A cover story intended to fool anyone that didnt know the real ACChain history. 1- claimed &gt;""From January 2018 the business started formally restructuring management changed and Genevieve Leveille and Serena Yin claim they were brought in to lead the global development strategy. Obvious coverup because there was no mention of any restructure in January. All through 2018 they claimed the opposite. the key people were due at events (no evidence) and team were still at work (with no updates on GIT) So this is perhaps the only explanation they could make up after the scam was exposed. If it was a restructure then why not get the original team to announce it, oh yeah because theyre **in Jail or hiding from police**. 2- claimed &gt;ACChain was working with a reduced team when a cyber-attack took place in April 2018 and they were investigating and refunding coins. This was never admitted back in April, so if it did happen they covered it up for 3 months. A lot of people on telegram did claim missing coins but they did not get any explanation and the questions were censored or deleted. The way coins were taken clearly pointed to an inside job as it had access to wallet keys, so it was probably the original team coming back to raid the coffers or Levelle and Yin taking it themself. 3- Claimed &gt;hundreds of thousands of voters who voted for ACChain to win the Chainnews 2018 Blockchain Star award in Asia. **This is not possible**. Hundreds of thousands voting has NEVER happened in a blockchain competition. Why would a largely unknown coin get so many votes? Obviously, they paid for the award or used bots or a script to cheat the system. Either way trying to validate themselves with this and the IDAXC was clearly desperation. 4- Claimed &gt;In January 2018, ACChain also received accreditation from IDAXC  the global decentralized digital asset management organisation Which turns out to be a non-existent organization with website under construction. [URL Why post a fake organization as validation when youre trying to clear your name? [**URL If you google ACChain you see that most of the media picked up the real story and exposed the scam, except ONE [URL Based on the fact that he shilled them before and knows the real background this one conrary post by **Bob Welldon** would indicate ***Bob is complicit in the SCAM*** or intentionally helping them cover it up. He seem to be assisting them in other ways too. A few days after posting on medium all communication from ACChain stopped. It appears the social media team finally figured out they were being scammed too. What all the investors and now the crypto world could not understand is why after the scam had clearly been uncovered did Genevieve Leveille and Serena Yin go to such effort to try to keep the scam going. Thanks to the original telegram article a lot of people helped answer that too. **Genevieve Leveille is involved in at least 9 other ICO scams** and she is flying around the world speaking at events pushing them as much as possible. It suggest she is trying to c*ash out all these other scams a quickly as she can before the ACChain story and her history gets too widely known*. She may be a few months away from disappearing forever back to Nigeria or wherever so got to get her investigated quick.

Themis has some real technology and seems to be raising tens of millions and there is the feel of ACChain about it. Themis refused to comment about how deeply involve Leveille and got evasive about her involvement. Themis might be the legitimate one of the 9 but this should be enough to avoid them. Themis just removed all the adviser names from their whitepaper so maybe a way to quietly distance themselves from Leveille. The waybackmachine never forgets though. The PI could find little background information on Serena Yin like a ghost they said, Genevieve Leveille appears to have a history of scams and crime long before she became involved in ICO scams. The PI found newspaper notices regarding legal action for IP violations and securities fraud in papers in Singapore, UK and Jersey from July to September 2017. A person claiming to be her former co-worker from a bank in the UK said that around October 2017 Leveille was desperately trying to borrow money from anyone to her to pay legal costs claiming she was victim of people ripping her off but soon she was coming into big money. A few months later she was living the high life and pretty clear she learned how to do ICO scams. Leveille is supposed to be a US Citizen of Nigerian origin. Leveille frequently still claims to be founder of UK company 0tentic8 Ltd which Leveille and a partner Duane Gafoor of Hong Kong incorporated in December 2016 and dissolved in August 2017.

I know this is already a breach of privacy. I feel terrible for it and I haven't done it since. I was going to close the tab after I was done but I accidentally clicked on the ""Generate and set random password"" button. I cannot reverse this change. I don't know what the password is.

85,cyber-crime,legaladvice,Some Legal Advice Regarding Swatting,0,8uzwg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8uzwg8/some_legal_advice_regarding_swatting/,2018-06-30 16:04:32,"DAs, here's what you should do by default. \-Charge the cop with aggravated manslaughter because that best matches the situation. ""I panicked and pulled the trigger."" You can't make murder on the cop because you will never prove intent or premeditation. Also conduct a federal investigation of the department. \-Charge the swatter with conspiracy to commit murder. There's intent, there's premeditation, and it's clear that the stories they tell police are designed to maximize the possibility of a shooting. Add lesser includeds. If the swatter has done this multiple times, charge him for each count and make his sentence concurrent. \-If there was doxxing involved, charge the doxxer with conspiracy to commit murder. That case can be made if the doxxer sought out the swatter and encouraged him to swat. Charge involuntary manslaughter in the alternative and lesser includeds. \-If someone encouraged the doxxer to dox, charge him the same as the doxxer. I think that's a reasonable standard and I don't think criminal charges should only be brought when someone actually dies or gets hurt. It's a crime to attempt it and it's a crime to give the police false alarms. We need to make examples of swatters and doxxers. They're cowards and they wouldn't do it if they thought they'd get in big trouble for it. This is a new age of cyber crime and the system needs to catch up. Legislators, pass laws defining swatting and doxxing as specific crimes. I'm sure the vast majority of you would agree with me on swatting, but I anticipate freedom of speech arguments for doxxing. Here's the thing. Blackmail is a crime and so is extortion. These crimes are about threatening to release sensitive information if the victim doesn't meet the perpetrator's demands. It's only illegal to make a threat if you're threatening illegal action. It's not a crime if I threaten to do something I have every right to do. So, it's implicit in our current laws that releasing someone's private information is a crime. There is also the right to privacy, which is grounded in the Constitution. It's a right that has been waning. It needs bolstering. Protecting our privacy from other citizens is one step on the road to reversing the Patriot Act and an America that has more safeguards in place to prevent similarly unconstitutional legislation from being passed in the future."

The main reason I'm posting this story is because I want to figure out what really happened. I still have the system logs, network activity, Slack conversations, and several screenshots from the night I mention. I don't know how much of it is actually relevant, but if there's something in there that someone with iOS or network security can decipher, I would want to talk to them, if only for my own sanity. There are things that happened here that are my own fault, and due to my technical naivety. I'm just looking for advice on what my options are and to understand the situation, not a reprimand for the poor decision-making. About 2 years ago, I was working at a media/tech company under the umbrella of a major sports league when this happened. The league's tech side (~2000 people) acquired the software company I worked at (~50 people) in fall 2015. This was my first job right after college in summer 2015 and I was officially hired as the merger was announced. I work in UI design, and my software and IT knowledge was lacking at the time. I was bringing my personal macbook to the office, and doing most of my work through there for a few months. After the company was acquired, I continued to do so. My work laptop was several years old and too slow for Adobe software that I was using daily. Around late spring of 2016, I started noticing unusual behavior on my work laptop. Recent searches appearing that I never typed, new Spotlight search recommendations like Activity Monitor and Network tools, apps accessed that I never use, files opened that I rarely access. One example is with the Dropbox app - my personal account was connected to my work computer, and I noticed my selective sync settings kept changing to sync my personal folders, which I explicitly made sure to exclude. I had to keep changing them almost daily. I ended up staying late one Friday night to try to fix it. I thought changing my work computer permissions would stop it, and surprise, it stopped working after that genius idea. I still had my personal computer with me, which I started using at that point. I pinged a coworker on Slack who confirmed that the company does indeed have remote access to our machines through Meraki, and that he uses Little Snitch to block access. He sent me the link to it and I downloaded it. He suggested I boot the work laptop into single user mode to fix those permissions and sent some links to help. At this point, it's 9pm and there's a dev who's also staying late. I tell him what's going on with the permissions and all and he sends me other links, and tells me to run those commands to fix it. None of them work or really change anything. I attempt to call our company 24/7 IT support but it goes to voicemail. I message a few more people on Hipchat, but no one can really help. Eventually, I drive directly home. Once I get home, I see this Little Snitch tool constantly pinging me on my personal machine, but can't recall what the notifications said said. I changed some of the settings, which might've have opened some kind of door into my machine. This is when it starts getting scary. As I attempt to revert the settings, I see the settings change back and lock, as if I didn't do anything. I keep trying to change this with no luck. Windows start popping on my screen for system settings and I hear that apple lock sound open, which I quickly try to counteract. Essentially, I go into panic mode and start defending my computer against all these attacks which are happening every second. Notifications that looked inauthentic and almost like a fake Apple UI with blurry icons keep popping up requesting my password, which I try to exit from. At some point in the night, I booted into recovery mode and saw what looked like another drive, or connection, that was connected to my computer. I could see what they were doing and saw that a folder being viewed in my Dropbox folder. I realized I could look into their directory as well, but the only folder I was able to see before they disconnected was called Power Management. I can't remember all the details of that night, but it ended with me locking myself out of my own machine when creating a Firmware password. The password I setup wasn't working. I was mostly worried about access to private information like bank/email passwords, family info, etc. When I called Apple after the Firmware lockout, they asked me if my operating system was bootleg, and doubted the authenticity of my operating system. I end up taking it to the Apple store that day. They were really concerned and adamant about this. Is there a possibility that my experience at home with the obvious remote connection is due to something that happened at work via the network? I have no idea why they would think my operating system was fake and I can't really explain how that would happen. I got in the office late that following Monday and was really distraught after messing up both my work and personal computers. The IT guy gave me a loaner machine to use in the meantime. I am still seeing the activity I saw on my original work machine that prompted my suspicion like recommended Spotlight searches of network activity files and Activity Monitor that never came up in the past. I end up looking into system logs and console activity and not really understanding what I'm looking at, but I still save it. It starts getting really late at this point, like 2 am and I am there alone. And this is the really fucked up part when I start to hear noises throughout the office. Two women talking to each other like they're having a conversation. They're whispering to each other, and I can't make out what they're actually saying, but it's loud enough that I can hear them. I start walking around the office trying to find where it's coming from but I can't find them anywhere. I walk around but there's no one around. I go back to my desk and continue to save logs. I realize what's going on is that there is someone actively mirroring my display and viewing my screen via an Apple TV and various other connected devices. At just the right moment, I'm able to change settings and view their screen, seeing their desktop. It quickly goes back to my screen as they disconnect. I also realize there's a remote connection via a Mac Mini, and I somehow am able to view their widgets screen. None of this would ever on this computer before. I also hear the sound of doors closing across the office by the kitchen, but when I go there there is no one there. When I go to the bathroom at one point, I hear two guys talking to each other in the men's bathroom, and I assume that's who's been in the office. As I walk back to my desk, I see one of the employees walking outside in the distance towards his house, the same guy who sent me links on changing permissions. At this point it's 7am and the receptionist is making coffee. I start to hear their voices again coming from an office near the main door. As I walk towards this office, the receptionist enters through the main door, and is walking towards me in the opposite direction. There is a burst of laughter, very loudly and clearly, from that office I'm about to walk into. The receptionist and I both look at each other and I say explicitly, ""You heard that, right?"" and she confirms that she did but we both see no one there. I go back to my desk and see the first dev arrive. When I walk away from his area, I hear the first voices I heard of the women. This time, I can clearly hear her say, ""Is she gone?"" and when I approach, he is just standing over someone's empty desk responding when there's no one else there. I wonder if this was all just a sick prank and if this all of this was being sent on some kind of speaker. There is much more that happened afterwards regarding HR, an attempt to escalate the issue, and non-stop verbal harassment until I had no choice but to quit.All of this raises some very disturbing questions... although management is allowed to monitor employees, at what point does it become malicious behavior? And who was it that kept viewing mirroring my display when I was there that night? I'm not sure if this is the proper subreddit for this story, and looking for all the help I can get, so I'll be posting to similar channels as well. TLDR: While working at my former job, I experienced remote connections to my computer. I saved log files and online conversations and want to understand on a technical level what happened and who I can talk to about this."

This time, I can clearly hear her say, ""Is she gone?"" and when I approach, the dev is just standing over someone's empty desk responding when there's no one else there. Like he's speaking into a mic or something. I wonder if this was all just a sick prank and if this all of those sounds were being sent on some kind of speaker. There is much more that happened afterwards regarding HR, an attempt to escalate the issue, and verbal harassment until I had no choice but to quit. All of this raises some very disturbing questions... although management is allowed to monitor employees, at what point does it become malicious behavior? And who was it that kept viewing mirroring my display when I was there that night? I believe what was happening in my situation was malicious. What I'm asking in this post is how would one go about proving this in various system logs, what do I need to show, who would I even talk to to confirm this? For instance, when I saw the screen change, is there a specific log I can look at in system logs to show this was happening? It seemed like whoever was remotely connecting was not part of the IT or management, who I assume would have those types of privileges. And even then, I doubt how ethical it is to cast someone's screen on an Apple TV, as opposed to using the proper software. To me, this seems like a crime, and I want to know how to prove that. I'm not sure if this is the proper subreddit for this story, and looking for all the help I can get, so I'll be posting to similar channels as well. TLDR: While working at my former job, I experienced remote connections to my computer. I saved log files and online conversations and want to understand on a technical level what happened and who I can talk to about this."

Her Facebook should have been more secure and I have since then assisted her in increasing her privacy so that the possibility of this happening again is slim to none. My question is would this be considered a crime in which she could file charges against, essentially, her cyber bully. The photo was not sexual in nature and was intended on personally attacking her.

89,cyber-crime,legaladvice,"When the word ""crime"" is used, does that mean a single offense, or the entire incident?",3,8jpjmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8jpjmv/when_the_word_crime_is_used_does_that_mean_a/,2018-05-16 07:53:41,"To explain, I'm looking over the 4473 form for purchasing a firearm, and while I think I'm in the clear, I had a question on what the word ""crime"" is actually meaning. For some background, when I was 14, I got charged with harassment and cyber harassment of a child (summary offense and M3 in Pennsylvania respectfully). I completed a diversion program (informal adjustment) to avoid a conviction for the summary offense, an adjudication of delinquency, and getting my case dismissed as well as records expunged. Currently, the general law on people prohibited due to criminal issues is anyone who is convicted of a felony, a domestic violence misdemeanor, or a misdemeanor with more than 2 years imprisonment possible, and since I'm not convicted or adjudicated for the purposes of the form or bring up any red flags for those, I should be good on that front. So looking at those, with this being one incident, would someone looking at it just add both of the max sentences up, or look at them individually? I'm already expecting a simple delay just so my information is looked over when buying a gun if there happens to be a problem seeing between a charge or conviction, but seeing ""crime"" this way, could that add more issues?"

91,cyber-crime,legaladvice,[United States - North Carolina] I am a freelance linux systems administrator and may of unknowingly helped a cyber crime - need advice...,49,8dfaof,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8dfaof/united_states_north_carolina_i_am_a_freelance/,2018-04-20 01:02:57,"Hello /r/legaladvice, Last year I accepted a freelance gig from someone I thought was a friend. I didn't understand the legal implications at the time of what this person was doing so I didn't exactly make an effort to hide my identity. It started out as a site like Pastebin (I wrote a PHP Clone of it - very basic for $15.00 USD), later the same person asked me to maintain some Linux/Nginx Web Servers for him and paid an undisclosed here amount of money (Less than $1,000 USD in total payments). Lately I have read on security blogs that people sending ddos attacks have been arrested and I may of been involved with the source of some. Basically to describe my work I would log into a linux server the person bought, install Nginx and PHP (takes less than an hour) and a database server, he uploaded his files and database for whatever website he made at the time. I was never involved with site content only (with the exception of the pastebin clone website since I coded it's script) making sure the servers didn't crash which were hosting several projects. I got curious and looked at his web server configs to see what sites he ran around that time I realized he was running a ""DDoS for Hire"" service at that point - the person told me at the time he was helping people test their webservers for vulnerabilities, he then put up marketing a few months and a landing page which made it clear that wasn't true. Once I discovered this I stopped providing services as I felt it was unethical. According to the website's most recent stats (at time of writing), assuming they are not fabricated - they very well could be, this site could be making $1,000s to $10,000s a month while I got nearly nothing for my involvement as a systems administrator. Notes: * The person's discord account was suspended (discord deleted the account) for abuse as well as the support server was shutdown. * I no longer have any contact with the person and blocked the person from contacting me * I'm not naming the site to avoid this throw-away account from being linked to me. A few things to consider: *) For a month or two I handled billing on a Cloudflare Account, the client's prepaid card wasn't accepted so I accepted a paypal payment instead and logged in and linked my paypal and paid the Cloudflare bill. I didn't feel comfortable contining so I stopped. That said the Cloudflare Account forever has a copy of my paypal email, full name, and mail forwarding address - e.g. a paper-trail linking to me. This worries me the most out of things since blame could be put on me. *) I'd say since late October-November 2017 I terminated services to the person. *) I do not understand exactly what laws effect these services - I've seen news articles about users being arrested or questioned but nothing about the operators being arrested. I am not, and will not ever be an operator of such a site but as a freelance Linux Systems Admin was my involvement illegal? *) I've made several attempts to contact their webhosts, cloudflare, and domain registries, and payment processors to get the site shutdown since then. *) His buddy and him are now liking making $1000s if not $10000s per month from this. Questions: *) A paper-trail exists, if the site gets investigated is it likely I will be questioned and/or arrested based on information they get from Cloudflare billing if Cloudflare is sent a court order for billing info. This person likely has hidden his identity from me while I hid from no one not understanding what was going on. *) By helping a website managing Linux servers not understanding the purpose - did I commit a crime? *) What legal defenses do I have if I'm questioned and/or charged with a crime since I technically helped the site. *) Would it be a good idea to report the site to law enforcement today before it's an issue and explain my involvement and give them information I know to get the site shutdown? Any help or advice you could provide would be greatly appreciated. Cheers, MimiKuKu Linux Sysadmin"

The information is blatantly, and provably false. So, we don't think it is too much of a stretch to think our competitor is behind this. This has already had a very real negative impact on our business - and something we are keen to put a stop to ASAP. Many of these groups do not allow businesses to post, so a direct response on social media is not an option. Besides, it would draw more attention to it without solving the problem.

I had facebook accounts created using different names but with my photos. I was in MN. The perpatrators were a few different places. It's hard remembering a lot of specific details since I'm 30 now.

He was a drug addict, very narcissistic, made over $100k a year but we lived like paupers...(I didn't even know that he made so much til he had to produce tax papers in divorce court!) Finally, things got so bad that I took my teenaged child (not his child) and we fled with what we could carry. I filed for divorce. I stopped talking to him, changed my phone number, and so now his only method of contact was email. He has stalked me and my now young adult child since, which he can easily do, as he knows everything about our lives, including our SSNs and all our associates. He contacted all my family and friends, even my then boss. Depending on the person and his aim, he was telling various stories in order to pump them for info. He showed up often at my work and would engage me. My child at work, he would watch but but not engage. He followed me sometimes when I was driving and so my child and I would both take meandering routes and watch for him everywhere we went. He found out about a second job I had picked up and I had to warn them that he was threatening to show up there. I lost that job, and I'm sure that's why... Although I was hiding our new address, he paid for our info and obtained our address. I'm not even sure how because my new address doesn't even show up on my credit report or when I google myself. So then he was peeping in my windows, telling my neighbors lies about me, and doing regular drive bys. Since I've left, he has regularly sent me very emotionally volatile emails. He either admits or the emails give away the fact he's monitoring our lives. Sometimes they contain outright or veiled threats to destroy my life, have me thrown in jail (for imaginary crimes), or have me expelled from the country (my child and I are immigrants). He's tried to ruin my current relationship. He knows alllll the details of my life, and those around me. I obtained a PPO but whenever he breached it, the police would dutifully take my report but inform me there was nothing they could do unless he committed an actual crime against me. So, essentially, it was useless. As far as I know, the PPO has now expired. My lawyer said our only recourse was to file a particular motion to have him thrown in jail for disobeying the court order but I didn't want that because I needed the spousal support to get by. The divorce was finalized this past spring but the distressing emails haven't stopped. I received one again today... telling me he had hired a cyber investigator who dug up incredible amounts of dirt on me (imaginary), that he has the ability to access my devices since I've owned them since we were together... and again saying he could have me thrown in jail or out of the country... admitting he's still stalking my kid... says he has boxes of evidence against me... has access to my medical files even.. but won't use all this against me if I agree to meet with him in person. For ""closure"". I'm so desperate to make this stop. I don't respond to any of it but it's not working. I don't have a lawyer anymore. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

They've threatened to kick me out several times now, they tell me how I should be ashamed of myself, that I make everyone else's lives miserable. That does not sound as bad as it should, but when you've been dealing with it for as long as I have(5+ years now), and have such low self esteem that the only person you feel comfortable enough to reach out too for help is a 30 year old man that probably just wants to take advantage of you, you'd be pretty fucking desperate too.

It's good that people talk about how to prevent it generally. However considering how internet is built-in almost in every device in our homes, it's opening new possibilities to see what's going on in another persons life. While information itself isn't dangerous, it's much about how people use it. So when it comes to cyber stalking, it actually punishable by law and if so, when would it become that? I'm not talking only about the common things such as a crazy ex trying to order stuff in your name or a social media account security, but more about situations like this: Person A had someone hack into their phone without their awareness, now this stalker can simply listen to everything that happens around Person A and even record stuff from their camera and microphone. The stalker saves these records on their own device intending to ruin Person A's reputation for whatever reason would cause them to stalk another in the first place. Person B is an IT expert and sometimes hangs out with Person A. The IT expert notices something weird happening with Person A's phone and looks more into it. Since the stalker made a poor choice of which they used for gaining access to this device, Person B spots this and is concerned about Person A's privacy. Now there are two different outcomes: either the stalker had caused harm to Person A's reputation before the IT expert noticed the stalking. The stalker could be tracked down by authorities but how much harm would have to be caused before they'd bother? Or: the stalker didn't cause harm to Person A's reputation yet, but Person B (the IT expert) manages to get some proof that the stalker had received and saved some sensitive info about Person A through their efforts, possibly intending to use it later for harmful purposes. Would this stalking still be considered ""illegal"" or ""punishable by law"" generally? In the first example the damage had already been done while in second the damage could be prevented, but there's a risk there will be harm to another. If we go deeper into situations like these, although it may be rare: what about when it comes to the stalker and their target living in different countries, perhaps the target's country having stricter policy about it than the country where the stalker is living?

His message was the typical ""are you going to be in x location. I want to do you"" I get from guys so I thought nothing more of it. In the last week or so he's decided that he would contact guys in my success posts (I name them all in my posts, and several have submitted their own stories). The first time he just asked if the story was true and that he was considering making a comment and seemed to the guy he pm'd like a shy first timer/long time lurker to the sub. This fits with the context of his initial pm to me a month earlier. However, this has changed in the last 24 hours. He's messaged another guy and told him a completely different story. Now the story goes that I met him for a sexual encounter, and that I have HIV and so does he. Here's the thing. I didn't meet him under that username. He messaged me after I'd already made plans with the guys I was going to be seeing and I never responded to that username. Anyone I did meet up with is still in contact with me under the username we used to make arrangements with. At anytime if one of those guys found out that they did have HIV why couldn't he have contacted me by that account? I've asked the guys if they've heard from this user and they've all said no so he isn't 'warning' any local (to him) guys. I got a STI test (including checking for HIV) when I got home from my trip - I met most of these guys while on an overseas holiday. And all my results are clean. I wasn't infected with HIV when I met any of the guys in the location he's said we met in. Devils advocate: If what he says is true and that I did meet him and he's infected, doesn't that show that he's the one who infected me? I am positive that I never met him in real life and that he is just a sore loser who is lashing out at those more successful in meeting me. At the very least can I sue him for defamation? He's spreading lies and who knows what the next guy is going to get in his inbox about me. Worst case scenario: In the unlikely event that he was one of the guys I met then shouldn't I be able to get him charged under 'criminalization of HIV nondisclosure' or assault or something? But I can't know for sure if I got infected for another couple of months. I just want him to stop harassing the poor guys he's targeting. The one he told the HIV story to is scared shitless. I have screen shots of his messages to the guys and proof of when I banned and blocked him. I have also messaged the Reddit Mods to see if I can get him banned for the site completely, but am waiting for their reply. Can I please have some legal advice on how to stop him slandering me and terrorising other redditors? Do I need to see a cyber crime specialist or defamation lawyer or just go to the police and get him investigated and charged? If he's in another country does that make a difference on who to contact and how to charge him?"

We know exactly who this guy is. We know his name, his address, and he has directly threatened me. He has stolen a passport and is blackmailing with it. Is this enough to take to police and get the bastard arrested over international lines?

My girlfriend, Robin, and her mother have always had a rocky relationship and if I'm being frank, Agatha is emotionally abusive and a tad psychotic, but this isn't /r/relationships. Agatha had access for about 6 weeks. During this time, Robin and I used the messenger system. We talked about it being better for Robin to distance herself from her mother. We also talked about things of a sexual nature. Agatha took screenshots of our conversations. We know this because she confronted Robin about all the 'horrible' things we would say to one another, and how dare Robin let me bad mouth Agatha (eg agree with Robin that her mother is being abusive and controlling). She reveals that she took photos of all our conversations. Robin contacted facebook and forced a log out from all locations of her account and got a new password. But Agatha still has these screenshots and threatens to post them/send them to my family members. We all live in different states thus the multi state tag in the title. I know that she's violated some privacy/cyber security laws, but don't know what. Both Robin and I are looking to see what kind of legal recourse we have, if any, to make her delete the photos. And what kind of lawyer we would need to see to get this help. Thank you in advance. Edit: Just for some clarification, we are both legal, consenting adults. Robin does not live with her mother at this time, and I am similarly independent. Agatha was never given a password or permission to access any accounts, Robin left herself logged into a family device when she was visiting home one time. We're not seeking damages or jail; we just want her to delete the photos and know that she committed a crime so she'll back off."
106,cyber-crime,legaladvice,Someone stole my identity online twice and will probably do it again. I've already had authorities called on me and nobody will help.,33,63pm9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/63pm9j/someone_stole_my_identity_online_twice_and_will/,2017-04-06 10:31:32,"This is very long so I'll break it into segments. BACKSTORY Let me preface by saying that I think I know who's behind this. She lives in the US (I'm in Australia) and we met through a writing forum. She's constantly posting about me and my friends on her blog and has a history of harassing them anonymously. But i can't prove it's her. Also, about me. I'm an Animal Science student. I was also in wildlife rescue in possum care at the time. I work in the pet industry and I'm a puppy trainer. Animals are my life. Next year I want to move out of my state and pursue a job at the zoo where I did some work experience last year, but with all of this, I'm scared to. THE FIRST BLOG Last year someone made a Tumblr blog with all my Facebook pictures and statuses and Instagram pics. They used the same bio that I used on other websites. They posted pictures of my family and friends. And they posted a lot of animal abuse images. Zoophilia mostly. They posted about how the baby possums turned them on, how they wanted to fuck one. They posted a picture of my Aussie Shepherd with the caption ""lowkey lost my virginity to this dog. Peanut butter trick is my favourite."" Someone reported the blog to another one called ""report-a-predator"" asking followers to call Australian authorities. It would be easy to reverse image search the pictures of me and find my social media, where my location and wildlife rescue group was listed (thankfully not my employer at the time). MY ACTIONS I didn't know about any of this. I didn't use tumblr. I didn't know about it until my wildlife rescue group called me asking to talk about disturbing images I was posting online. A rep from the group, and a woman from the RSPCA, rocked up on my doorstep one night and showed me the blog. Of course I was shocked, especially because they both seemed convinced that I was behind it. After about half an hour they eased up and told me to go to the police. First thing I did was set all my social media to private. Then I got screenshots of the blog. Then I had it taken down. I emailed tumblr support to ask what I'd need for them to release the user details, and they said they'd needs subpoena. Okay, so. I went to the police. Police referred me to ACORN (Australia cyber crime online reporting network). I got a call the next day from them, asking if anyone in the images was under 18. I said no and they said they couldn't help me, no crime was committed, and hung up. At this point the blog was down and everything was resolved I guess, so I didn't pursue further. It's worth mentioning that I never received any further calls from wildlife rescue. Not about rescues, events, nothing. No response to my messages. They effectively ghosted me out, so in my opinion I directly lost a major passion of mine because of the blog. THE SECOND BLOG it came back a few months ago, same thing. They reposted pictures of me, plus some new ones from snapchat (turned out they'd added me under someone else's name, someone I knew, and were screenshotting everything I sent. I had noticed that and removed that person but of course damage was already done). Again I took screenshots, emailed tumblr and had it taken down. I put in a report with ACORN. This time I heard NOTHING from them. I emailed a lawyer for advice and he only suggested we alert tumblr, which I had already done. Around this time i found the report-a-predator blog and the post that had incriminated me in the first place. I asked them to take it down and emailed a mod with all my evidence and screenshots. She never responded and the post is STILL up as I type this. BOTTOM LINE I've already lost credibility in one group and I'm so scared that I'm going to lose my job if it goes far enough. I'm a casual. And I'm a puppy school instructor. No way would I keep that position if it blew up again. Im also afraid that this will stop me from pursuing my dream job Police won't help me because nobody is under 18, and to my understanding also because Tumblr's user privacy means we can't identify who it is. And we can't get that information without a subpoena so it's a catch 22. Report-a-predator won't help and there are still incriminating posts about me. I no longer hear from wildlife rescue. I need help. Any advice. Please. TL;DR - I work with animals. Someone made a fake blog about me containing zoophilia. Already had authorities called on me. Police won't help. Terrified it's going to happen again and I'll lose my job. "

So my ex gf sent naked pictures of me to all of my family on Facebook using a fake Facebook account. She also sent these pictures to my 9 year old daughter. She then deleted the account. My daughter did not see bc my ex gf tipped me off saying in a text from a sideline number ""tell your dad open the porn. Everyone else in the family will. Don't forget (daughter's name)."" My dad laughed my family won't care but this girl just sent naked pictures of me to my 9 year old daughter. I reported it through Facebook as sexual harrassment / blackmail but I need to know how to pursue this or if I should. Can I report it any more? Should I? If so, who do I report it to? Is it provable in a court of law using IP addresses etc? **-----*EDIT / UPDATE*-----** First I want to say thanks for all of the replies, they've been quite helpful. If I told the story of the relationship everyone would think I was an idiot for letting myself get played for so long, but suffice it to say she was very abusive so a lot of these comments have been personally encouraging. However, since this is /r/legaladvice not /r/poorlifechoices, here's my update and another question or two: To clarify a few things: the images were nude erotic photos of me, one of which included my face. Yes I am a male. I just moved to the state I'm in 2 months ago to get away from her. In my state her offense is a misdemeanor whereas in her's it is a class of felony, though both carry similar punishments. I literally called the FBI. They transferred me to an FBI office in my state capitol, who transferred me to another FBI office, who instructed me to go on the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center ic3.gov and file my complaint there. According to their FAQ the complaints are reviewed by FBI analysts and disseminated to appropriate law enforcement agencies for investigation. Based on information from a professional friend with intimate knowledge of cyber security, I've been told not to worry about the evidence going ""stale"" and that everything she did can be tracked down to the location of a room she was in when she did it; and that my only time constraint is the statute of limitations (which I don't know exactly, but I'm at least sure I have some time). The last conversation my ex and I had was when she called me after sending the images. I told her she messed up, she sent pictures of me naked to my 9 year old daughter and family, and she's an idiot if she thinks the evidence can't be tracked. After that I hung up and haven't accepted any communications from her since. She is terrified, she has called me and texted me from multiple numbers saying things like ""What do you want ?! Like I can't go to jail I have babies"" and ""I stg I will give you whatever you want"". She even tried calling me and messaging me on Facebook from her Facebook account. Whew, maybe that's tmi for this sub. I'm certainly struggling with whether I want to drop all of this and move on with my life (I estimate a high chance that if I do I will never hear from her again as she will be too scared) or if I want to seek justice (which is more stress and work on me). If I pursue (which is most likely yes) should I use this ic3.gov channel or take the advice of /u/AcrossFromWhere and set an appointment with a local detective? "
108,cyber-crime,legaladvice,Not Reporting Verbal Abuse or Cyber Abuse is a Crime?,0,5gmn04,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5gmn04/not_reporting_verbal_abuse_or_cyber_abuse_is_a/,2016-12-06 02:59:15,"So in many areas of law (like military law, which is noticeably much more strict and subjective than civilian law, making crimes like out of things that may not be crimes in the civilian world-- like adultery or conduct unbecoming--) if you are a bystander to verbal abuse of any kind, not reporting it would actually be considered a crime or a punishable offense (misdimeanor?) in it of istelf. I know this may be very, very difficult to understand or believe, but from what I have read, it can be true-- and has been true. For instance if you witness a coworker making offensive remarks to another coworker and do nothing, you could be culpable. If you are in a group chat amongst coworkers on Facebook and one person says something offensive, you could be culpable. That puts bystanders in an extremely, brutally uncomfortable position. If you report it, you are creating a massive situation that has the potential to ruin someone's life forever over a deviant message that had the unintended consequence of offending someone. Or you might be reporting someone who was under a lot of anxiety and was simply letting off some steam-- although in a harmful way. Moreover, the person you report will almost certainly feel betrayed and no longer trust you. Not to mention the fact that management may now look at you as a sensitive person, and perhaps someone who is looking to get others in trouble. So my questions are-- A) Is it possible that you might be convicted of a crime for not reporting an instance of verbal abuse or cyber abuse in a civilian or military setting? B) If you choose not to report an instance of verbal or cyber abuse and are punished-- can a skilled lawyer see get you out of the punishment? C) If you do choose to report it and the complaint is investigated fully, and found not to be punishable, in some circumstances, you could be retaliated against for filing a false complaint. I personally know this is unjust and itself abuse, but it does happen. Is there anything a lawyer could do if you face repurcussions for making such a complaint? **TL;DR** I have 3 basic questions 1) As a bystander, is not reporting verbal abuse or cyber abuse a crime in either the civilian world or the military world? 2) If you choose not to report verbal or cyber abuse and it ends up adversely affecting your career because you are not promoted or let go-- is there anything a skilled lawyer can do to make sure you can be considered for promotion or are able to keep your job? 3) If it is determined that your complaint was not grounds for harrassment, bullying, or other verbal abuse and you are retaliated against, could a skilled lawyer get you out of this retaliatory punishment?"

Then this person processed to tell my brother he was a federal detective for the Massachusetts cyber crime division.

110,cyber-crime,legaladvice,[FB Sextortion/ Scamming] Advice for current victims,4,5bn9q8,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5bn9q8/fb_sextortion_scamming_advice_for_current_victims/,2016-11-08 03:57:32,"[USA]/[MS] My SO's father (1st generation immigrant, tech and English illiterate) accepted a FB request from a mid-late 20's Philippine woman yesterday. They were chatting and flirting, and eventually began webcamming on Skype. As you can imagine where this is heading, one thing led to another and they (I know it is a scammer entity, not a lone woman) were able to record my SO's father diddling himself on webcam, face included. She began to mention tuition, costs, and needed $500 USD or else she'd leak his videos. They were able to figure out who his wife and kids were on FB, along with his close friends. He had his friends and phone number information view able to friends so they captured that as well and used it in their threat. Before they reached me, my SO's sister banned him from friends on FB, but this opened a can of worms as she remembered she needed screen shots of the scammer, so then proceeded to un-ban the scammer. She tried to ban them again but apparently FB has a 48 hour time constraint if you un ban and ban someone immediately. After my SO reached out to me for help, I did a couple of quick google searches on several legal and scamming sites and sub reddits, all basically saying it's futile to track them down or contact authorities. The conclusion seemed to be _never negotiate with them or send money, just ban and move on. Handle damage control on your own._ Upon discovering that we attempted to ban them on FB, they doubled down on their bluff by sending a Youtube link of the uploaded web cam video. With that in mind I decided to raise their _bluff_ with one of my own, I proceeded to type the following message before deactivating my SO's fathers FB: &gt;Blackmail is a serious crime, I have enough information on your account to report to the police and INTERPOL. Whether you post or not, I am reporting your accounts to law authorities. Additionally, I have requested several cyber security specialists to track your account information (Facebook, Skype, etc.) so that we can build a case against you and your black mail threats, and ultimately track you down. Since you have already threatened black mail, INTERPOL Manila does have a system to help us track you down as an offender based on the network traffic I have logged against you. Blackmail and extortion is a serious crime in any country, especially yours, you will be jailed at the very least for this, I hope you enjoy your punishment under Duterte's draconian law system. Enjoy your day. &gt;Section 10 of the Libel Law (Act No. 277) is as follows: Every person who threatens another to publish a libel concerning him, or any parent, husband, wife, or child of such person, or any member of his family, and every person who offers to prevent the publication of any libel upon another person, with intent to extort any money or other valuable consideration from any person, shall be punished by a fine of not exceeding one thousand dollars or by imprisonment for not exceeding six months, or both. The last responses we received before deactivation were: * _goodluck_ * _ur a maniac_ I proceed to kill his account and flag their uploaded video on Youtube for nudity. Turns out they had another victim on that same Youtube account diddling himself. 24 hours later we found out the videos were taken off of Youtube (unsure if it was taken down by Youtube or the scammers took it down), and they had also shut down the scammer's FB account. None of his immediate family have reported the video leaked via FB messenger, so we are just hoping they decided it wasn't worth it and moved on. __TLDR__: SO's father was recorded diddling himself on Skype with female scammer entity, tried to ban them but un-banned to get screenshots of the predator resulting in 48 hour time constraint by FB. Raised their bluff of leaking the video to family and friends by typing out a threat of reaching law authorities, no attack has been reported by scammer yet and their accounts are taken down. So given these sequence of events, I must also advise to never negotiate with scammers, it's a lose-lose situation if you do. Call their bluff, and be ready for damage control if they continue with their threats. "

Me: Idc, I don't do cam, too many pervs. Guy: If you shy, you can hide face or fix cam below face and watch me, I will not identify you. Me: No thank you. Guy: Please do not be rude.

Doesn't matter if you're from another country, also I am recording all of these texts, just so you know. So that was the chat, I want to point out a few things: This is a chat room specifically for 13-19 year olds, not a dating site or anything like that. I know he didn't say or send any graphic things, but the many things he said and that he attempted to blackmail me for not doing the things he said makes me wonder if this would be attempted exploitation (i don't know a better word). I am unsure if this is an actual crime because he didn't send me any nude photos or other graphic material. He wanted me to watch him on camera after saying he wanted a hot chat, so I think I know what he was going to do. The #1 thing I wanted to say is that I *know* he has done this type of thing before. When I cut off chat with him, I contacted an admin of the site and they told me that the person had done this same type of thing the previous Monday to 2 other girls (don't know if they were underage or if they gave into his claims). I think he will continue to do this sort of thing and may be an online predator. I am 16 years old, so I am a minor and had my age under my username of my account. This is a chat room where you can use fake names and not have to register as a member and I have seen people both older and younger lie about their age on the chat site. I am sorry for this being so long and that this may be a stupid thing to ask but my questions are: (1) Is what he did illegal? (2) Could this be an attempt at sexual exploitation of a minor? (3) Can I report this to my local police as a crime? Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this and answer my questions. I am too embarrassed to tell anyone about this, so my parents don't know though I am hoping to tell my psychiatrist as soon as she is available for an appointment. I was thinking about making an online report to my local police station; however, I do not wish to get in trouble for reporting something that turns out not to be a crime."

This tale has many nuances. I will attempt to arrange the information into small, easier to digest bites. I will make a larger post about this entire situation later but for now these are the most important questions I have. (Sections are labeled for quick reference) A) I have been stalked by a woman on the internet, whom we'll call Ann. Ann first began sending me strange Email as early as 1998, well before the glory days of Gmail's unlimited account storage. Because of this, none of those first correspondences survive in record. In fact, it wasn't until Ann had sent me quite a few of her strange emails that I began to save them - first because it was kind of funny to get long emails of utter nonsense. B) And then, it wasn't funny anymore. Ann created a webpage with my and my husbands full names, our current address and many recent past addresses, and the most terrifying of all; there were Google maps screenshots of our home and property, long tirades of strange accusations making claims that I had 'raped her while we were students at LMU' (*note: I have never attended LMU*) which is located in California. (*note: I have never set foot in the state of California.* Ann made claims on her website that I have sex with my pet dog. She then proceeded to email this webpage to any person she could find that was connected with my private life, including members of my family and even going so far as to send this libelous mess to the non-profit animal rescue I donate my time to in some sort of sick attempt to get me removed from my position there. C) I had finally had enough at this point and filed a restraining order against Ann. This went pretty well, and after filing on **03 FEB 2014** my no contact (50-B) order was issued on **17 MAR 2014** in my home state of North Carolina. This order is the longest one that NC offers and only lasts 1 year from the date of granting. This order therefore expired on 17 MAR 2015. On **5 MAY 2014** I receive notice that Ann has requested a 50-B no contact order against me. I chose not to appear in court for this as I live in North Carolina and have never set foot in California, and frankly couldn't afford the expense. Thusly, on **14 JULY 2014** I received notice that Ann had been granted a *counter* no-contact (50-B) order against me in her home state of California. D) Now, some time passes within our story and this is are relatively calm. Ann continues through this time to make social media posts using my full name, but when I call to report it as harassment I am told by the police that if there are no threats then shes not violating the order. This seems suspect to me in a very great way. Firstly, she just went in front of a judge telling them how ookyspoopy scary I am but she isnt afraid to flounce around writing walls of text about me? E) I had hoped that with the step taken of getting the law involved that would have been the end of the harassment and all memory of Ann would fade into the past like most awful things. Because I felt comfortable, I let my 50-B lapse and did not renew it past its 1 year date. F) During this window of Ann having a 50-B against me, but me having no further court orders on he, she had began a blog. I only ever found the existence of this blog because I use Googles targeted search keyword alert service, and while things had been in the heat of tension I did not want to visit Anns webpage every day to see if she had updated it with information about me (thus violating the order that was active at the time. So, basically any time that Ann makes a post to her social media or blogs, and it contains my name, Google kindly delivers it to my inbox. G) So, the situation at this point is that it is roughly around June 2015 and I start getting 2-4 emails a day, hits off of this alert I have set up. Ann has gone off the deep end at this point and is now making some of her most outrageous claims - that *I 'raped her in college*, that Im stalking 'her nephews (she very specifically says her sisters underage sons. I have confirmed via external sources that Ann is an only child.) H) As a sample of the truly bizarre and horrifying things that Ann posts about me on the regular, Ive picked out a selection from a single post. This one is frankly more mild than most, but you can read in it the level of strangeness and mental gymnastics she makes. I ask you to please keep in mind while reading this: I have been married to my husband since 2003. We're celebrating over-double-digits happily. But according to Ann Im a raging lesbian. [Imgur](URL I realize this has been an awful wall of text, and I do apologize for that. We are nearly to the end, and to my questions. I) So time has moved on, as it likes to do, and I have mostly quietly endured while all the while saving + documenting as many of the posts that make claims, threats, or in any other way statements about me. As I mentioned before, I know that Ann still has some years left on the 50-B she was granted against me, so its felt like this is I can do. J) Except this week, everything changed. I received a call from the President at the animal rescue where I volunteer at, and she informs me that the sheriff has just been up there looking for me with a restraining order from California. She turned them away as I dont work a schedule and dont live in county, and not much longer after that they turned up on my doorstep. Surprise, notice of a hearing for a 50-B no contact order, filed in the clerk of courts office on 09 AUG 2016. This 50-B paperwork was not only filed in the exact same courthouse / district that issued the last one, its listed as also being the same CASE NUMBER as the previous, issued two years and and still has a year left to go, 50-B. ---- For these questions please note: I live in North Carolina and Ann lives in California. This is an inter-state cyber-crime case. **Question #1:** Referencing section D, J Id love some insight into the legality of this - if a judge knew this was going on, would it likely make him pause and reconsider *the evidence* with more scrutiny and perhaps throw out the previous ruling? **Question #2:** Referencing section F. Is using Googles smart search filter in this way a breach of a 50-B? I am not trying to find out any information about Ann, I am just trying to gather evidence that relates to me and the case I am hoping to one day see to fruition in a civil courtroom. **Question #3:** Referencing section J Ive closely compared the forms, and the one that was delivered yesterday is pretty much exactly the same as the one I got two years ago from Ann. I am REALLY confused as to why they would issue a second restraining order when the first one hasn't ended yet. Could she have been fabricating evidence or something and is trying to entrap me? -- I just I don't know what to do with this situation and I guess as you can probably tell I type a lot when I get anxious. THANK YOU if you made it through all of that. Ill try and answer any questions people might have to help clarify anything here. Ive laid here in bed and written this whole thing on my phone after being up for 39 hours"
115,cyber-crime,legaladvice,Create a blog post and parody Twitter account making fun and insulting a president at a company that screws me for money. President calls my job and gets me fired as well as filing a cyber harassment complaint in state of NJ.,0,4n23zh,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4n23zh/create_a_blog_post_and_parody_twitter_account/,2016-06-08 09:47:01,"So the story started in April of this year. I had a benefits debit card with a $300 balance of pre-tax money. The company apparently has a sneaky use it or lose it policy where after some time they'll send leftover balance to your ""employer"" (they actually send it to their parent company instead who also refuses to refund this amount). After 3 hours of frustrating calls to their customer service and Twitter banter @thecompany, they refuse to budge. Out of anger, I create a blog post on my personal blog calling out the president of the department and calling him an ass and douche until he addresses this (those exact words and nothing more obscene). Additionally I create a parody Twitter page of that president marking it as a #parodyaccount in the first tweet and bio. In the 80+ tweets, I make self-deprecating jokes about being greedy, having gas, and quoting rap lyrics. I do not reach out to anyone in an attempt to impersonate him or say anything that could be confused for the real president (vulgar humor, silly commentary, jokes about being filthy rich). About a month after the blog and Twitter are active, my employer tells me someone complained about me doing this and they were not allowed to disclose who. I was fired on the spot. Out of confusion and fear that this man would continue reaching out to others in my life, I disable the Twitter and take down the blog post while keeping carbon copies. A few days later an NJ detective shows to my house (in NY) with 3 local detectives to arrest me. I'm not home and my brother posts bail (is it even legal for a cop to take cash from someone?). The complaint warrant cites NJS 2C:33-4.1 (a. A person commits the crime of cyber-harassment if, while making a communication in an online capacity via any electronic device or through a social networking site and with the purpose to harass another, the person: (1) threatens to inflict injury or physical harm to any person or the property of any person; (2) knowingly sends, posts, comments, requests, suggests, or proposes any lewd, indecent, or obscene material to or about a person with the intent to emotionally harm a reasonable person or place a reasonable person in fear of physical or emotional harm to his person; or (3) threatens to commit any crime against the person or the persons property.) Unfortunately, this is a new 2014 law and so far all the lawyers I've consulted with barely understand Twitter let alone this law. At the time of the complaint, there was no direct communication with the plaintiff from me. Moreover, nothing said is of a sexual nature, threatening, or even aggressive. Aside from saying that if my issue isn't addressed that I'd keep writing about him, there was little that could've been interpreted as threatening. I feel like this is a 1st amendment issue where I was angrily venting about a person heading a greedy corporation with scammy policies. But I have no idea what to expect as my first day at municipal court is in 2 weeks. Any idea what I should prepare to defend myself the best I can? Thanks to everyone in advance! "

I have full on logs of stuff she's done to me (most of which were from late 2015 and the amount of stress put me in academic probation as well as in student counseling services for the majority of the school year). I have tried to contact lawyers, but I have nowhere near enough money to file for Outrage. I have contact police but because of differing statutes and how new cyber crime is, they have done absolutely nothing.

I live in Washington state and my harasser in Georgia (US) This person has tormented me almost nonstop to the point of sheer paranoia and panic and I cannot even be so much as comfortable since she's now moving onto following/stalking my friends through me and they are letting me know.

Was seeking out advice on what to do about a situation that is affecting my family right now. Some details have been changed a bit to provide anonymity but Im not sure if that is even safe as these people have been hacking into stuff and have a knack for super sleuthing. My brother had an online relationship with someone for a few months. He changed some details about himself, wasnt completely honest and eventually ended up breaking it off with this girl. This girl and her friends have since hacked all of his email and social media accounts-put my brother on blast via social media and threatened my brothers career by finding out all the projects past and current he has been working on as well as his current employer (all details that werent freely given during the duration of the relationship) as well as sent him pictures of his house with threatening messages implying that they will be causing harm to his person, personal life, and career. I have proof that they have been hacking into his accounts as they were bragging about it and I have several screenshots proving this and the threatening messages they have sent out. They also made a post asking their followers if they would like his home address so that he could get knocked the fuck out. Now my brother is an adult, and petty cyber bullying is one thing, but threatening his career, his safety and publishing his personal info to thousands of people seems psychotic and scary to me. Make no mistake, I do not agree with what my brother did, as far as carrying on an online relationship with someone you had no intention of ever making a real physical relationship as well as hiding and skewing details about yourself to remain anonymous (my brother has a somewhat public career) but people do this everyday. It does not in anyway make it ok for these people to be harassing him the way they have been. I told him early last week that he needs to file a report because all of this is the very definition of cyber stalking and is a crime. He went to the police dept they brushed him off told him to file online with the FBI and that situations like this rarely if ever get resolved and if they do get looked at, it will usually take months or years to make any headway. This is absolutely ludicrious to me, but my brother had pretty much threw up his hands as the police dept didnt seem concerned or to take him seriously. Now things have escalated to a terrifying degree. Four days ago, my brother received an anonymous package in the mail. He had been tipped off that this was a package from the online girl. I advised him not to open so he tossed it, as god knows what was inside. (keep in mind that he had never provided his address, this girl and her friends stalked him and found it by their own means) The situation is starting to play like a Lifetime Movie- and though worried, my brother was comforted by the fact that this girl lives thousands of miles away from him.until 2 days ago. Brother was woken up to loud banging on back door. He peeked out side window and saw the online girl and her friends (who have also been harassing him) standing outside waiting in the middle of the night!!! They eventually left. Shaken up, my brother called the police dept again they said there is nothing they can do about it. They next day, my brother went to work as usual- The neighbor called him early in the afternoon to let him know that a few girls went and knocked on his door (neighbors door) and asked when my brother usually comes home. The neighbor felt something was off and told them he had no idea then called my brother to let him know. My brother immediatly left the office and headed to the police station to try and document these new developments and they did the same thing. Shooed him away. He even showed them screenshots and evidence of their threats and bragging about hacking all his accounts and they dont seem to care. This is all absolutely insane to me. I dont understand how nothing can be done about this. Someone who goes through these lengths to harass someone else is obviously unhinged and I am worried about my brothers safety. My brother is also scared. He has put a surveillance camera outside his house and recorded their car (the same one that he saw drive off when they came over the first night) drive slowly by his house 10 times. They also left another package (about the size of a shoebox) outside his house this morning. This one was not delivered by post, it was dropped off by them personally. I have many other insane details and events to provide but Im wary of giving out all in this public post and would feel more comfortable discussing this privately. This whole thing has me extremely paranoid and I wouldnt put it passed them to be tracking my online activity as well, thus alerting them to this post. What can we do to make law enforcement take this situation seriously, or are there any organizations that deal with stalking and harassment that can help my brother get this handled? Im scared, my brother is scared, Please Help! TLDR: Brothers online relationship turned sour. Girl went crazy. Stalked and hacked into all my brothers accounts. Made threats of assault, flew thousands of miles to my brothers city. Keeps driving by house, antagonizing neighbors. Leaving weird packages. Police are doing nothing. Please Help!!! "

They hide and I honestly only know that they are connected to an ex of mine. While I do my best just to ignore it, it's starting to spike again. Currently they are creating porn sites for my girlfriend, with posts of her, her home address, and the phone number that I recently changed due to having to block numbers every day. They are photoshopping photos of her onto pornographic images and doing their best to send it to her employers.

I didn't know how old she was so i was fairly open about stuff. She told me she was weird and i said ""no i have masturbated to my own pictures, trust me I'm weirder"" (which i meant as a joke) but then she started talking about her boobs and everything. I told her I'll reply to her in a while, because I wanted to masturbate and she asked if she was the reason, to which i jokingly said ""yes"" but then said ""No ugh ew no"" in the very next second. Thats all for that day. The next day she told me that she forgot to log out of her account and hoped that her mom didn't read the chat. Then suddenly her writing style changed and she kept wanting to meet me and call her and that sort of stuff. I didn't give any information, mainly because i had my suspicions. Then the person i was talking to said that X's accounts had been hacked since the past 3 days and he was working for the cyber cell. He said that her parents complained and that cops would show up at my place on Tuesday. He typed very weirdly (u for you, and many ""....."" and many grammatical errors) and when he refused to give me proof that he was cyber cell saying that I'll get proof when the cops come to my place on Tuesday (its Sunday, in india right now). He kept messaging me till 3 AM and he refused to tell me what wrong i had done and kept saying i was going to be arrested and juvenile court would decide what to do with me. He also said ""We have chats of you doing sex...Internet sex... you watch porn?!?...keep it up...that's nice...."" i told him my uncle was a lawyer and that he said i didnt do anything wrong just to throw him off (my uncle really isnt a lawyer).

Thank you in advance for your help. I've been stalked by a former neighbor of mine for 7 years. We were not former lovers nor friends, it was completely random. He has committed at least 7 different crimes against me ranging from battery, vandalism, stalking, to cyber harassment. The police haven't been helpful. I've spoken to several detectives and police and they refuse to do anything about it, even though I have 3 folders worth of evidence. He uses several websites to cyber harass me. He's put lies about online and has purchased variations of my birth name as domains. The end of February I filed a restraining order to put a stop to the cyber stuff. I was successful and received a permanent restraining order. I also asked the judge to sign off on additional orders which included ordering him to turn over the domain names and to remove the 40 different URL links he has about me online. I directly named the registrar for the domains and the hosting company for the content for them to remove the content. My stalker then filed an emergency ex parte motion to vacate for improper service (he was properly served). Meanwhile he switched registrars and a new hosting company to attempt to evade the court order. We had the emergency hearing but the judge for some reason set another hearing for 1 month out to give the opposing party time to provide proof they were not properly served. During that hearing I explained to the judge that my stalker was violating the restraining order and he clearly informed my stalker's lawyer that his client is to take off any likeness of me offline and to return the domains. I asked the judge if my restraining order stands until that additional hearing and he informed me that it did. After the hearing I received an email from his lawyer that he dropped out of the case. In the days following the exparte hearing I provided the new registrar company and the new hosting company a copy of the court order explaining to them that their subscriber was using them to commit a crime and evade an active court order. The new domain registrar worked with the registrar named in the court order, and they transferred the domains to my property. The new hosting company not named in the court order took down the content and told me they didn't need a court order but they deemed the content to be harassment which was against their TOS. I finally felt relieved that after 7 long years I had some justice. Little did I know, it would be short lived. Little did I know, the judge vacated my permanent restraining order and reinstated my temporary restraining order until the final motion to vacate hearing. This reversed everything. I lost the domains and my stalker moved to another hosting company that refused to comply because they were not named in the order. So we had the final hearing last week. A new lawyer showed up to represent my stalker (who was not present) I informed the judge again that my stalker was violating the restraining order and asked the judge if he could add to his order the new companies that my stalker switched to. He told me I would need to file. He ultimately decided that he was not going to grant my stalker the motion to vacate and I prevailed. The judge reinstated my permanent restraining order. I've been representing myself in court this entire time. I went to the law library and prepared a motion to modify the restraining order and went back to court to file it but the judge would not let me for some odd reason. If I can't name the new companies in the court order, they will not comply. I've spoken to both legal departments representing the registrar and the hosting company and they refuse to help me. I've explained to them that I should not need get a new court order every time my stalker switches companies, and they should realize that he is clearly using them to evade an court order. I also told them that they should not need to be named in the order to act. I told the new hosting company that they are hosting the same exact URL links that are reflected in a court order and they still refuse to comply. I now need to litigate against the new registrar and hosting company and my question is how exactly should I approach this? "

I'm counting all the amounts I have had to spend on new .com names to get away from trolls, the amount that I lost. I made several new .com sites that the trolls don't know about. Some people started slandering me but I only care to report one in particular that has been saying outrageous things about me and my dog that just recently died. The nasty comments are not posted publicly but I have a spam folder of all the disgusting things this poster has tried to post that I don't approve in the comments. It goes far beyond being crude. It has accused me of killing my dog when I didn't. It keeps calling me a dog killer, saving all my public photo albums creating slanderous memes off of my pictures of me and my dog, defaming me and my dog and it will not stop at all. It's even stolen my identity to say these nasty things pretending that I have said all those nasty things when I didn't. I shouldn't have to make myself private when I'm not breaking any rules. This person is and he deserves to rot in jail for what he is doing. I thought that by making my blog private after some time, the lunatic would go away, but once it knew my blog was public again, it still keeps harassing me and it's been going on for almost two years now non-stop every day. At another forum, it used to spam my public photo albums without my permission everywhere but the administrators there have deleted its slander. I have tried to ignored it but this is ridiculous that this person gets away with it because I can't do anything about it and he takes advantage of the fact that I wasn't going to report him to the police before to continue harassing me, but perhaps this is something I do need to report to the authorities since he won't stop on his own. He keeps accusing me of bothering him and his troll friends but they are the ones who stalk my personal sites every single day while I am ignoring them. I don't have a name, phone number or address of the troll that's harassing me, but I do have an IP address, City and state. Its IP address is: 68.39.136.193 from Oaklyn, New Jersey. When I looked up where it was located, I called Comcast its Internet Service Provider. The ISP said if I can file a police report, have the police call Comcast, they would be able to disable the troll's Internet when the police calls the ISP. Can someone please help me and show me how to file a cyber crime against an anonymous person? All I have is its IP address. I don't know a name, nothing or what it looks like. This person has at times stolen my identity to troll me anonymously so no one ever knows its real name, posted slanderous memes from my pictures without my permission, and said defamatory remarks about me being a dog killer when I am not. I have no idea what other Web sites this troll has uploaded its slanderous pictures about me, either and I was hoping police could investigate the troll's computer to see where else he has posted these slanderous lies about me. He also violates my privacy, telling people what city and state I live in when I did not have that posted publicly. He really had to search for my real last name to find my hometown. I used my Chinese name to post to avoid being stalked but because he is a stalker he found my real name anyway. He keeps telling people what my last name is so they know everything about me without my permission and I have no privacy at all. Some people are so nasty instead of showing sympathy for a pet dying that I already lost, this person wants to call me a dog killer this and that and I have had it with dragging an innocent animal into its cyber crime flame wars. Her memory does not deserve to be tainted by a venomous troll."

127,cyber-crime,legaladvice,RA and Suitemates harassing me at an escalated level,0,2w5xpl,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2w5xpl/ra_and_suitemates_harassing_me_at_an_escalated/,2015-02-17 16:34:34,"So I usually take shit from the rest of the suite because ""I can take it"" and I'm always smiling and just laugh it off. Generally, it's teasing with foul language and some slapping and punching. However, today, an incident occurred which turned five of them and my roommate against me. Today, my suitemate walked in while I was doing homework and asked for me to take a picture of him for his fake ID (second, he was disciplined for his first) because my Galaxy S5's camera is better than his iPhone's. Naturally, I said no unless he gave me ten dollars for it because I was doing time-intensive homework and I just didn't want to. He then proceeds to steal my phone from desk, uses my lock code by looking at the smudges, and tells me I won't get it back unless I take his picture and send it to him. He subsequently goes into his room and locks the door. I go to his door and try to get it back, but he continues to resist with my roommate and his roommate, so I say I'll take his picture and do. However, I do not send him the pictures and I change my lock code. He then brings our RA/suitemate/his fraternity pledge brother as well as three suite members to try and get the picture. I tell him he has to give me ten dollars and he throws a tantrum. He, my RA, roommate, and two suitemates proceed to hold me up by my legs and arms and tickle me. It progresses to him choking me, tackling me, and punching me. My RA keeps them from actually hurting me and pouring liquids (detergent, mouthwash, Febreeze) on me or my belongings. However, he tells my roommate to scare me into sending the picture by almost shaving my beard with his clippers. Finally, they leave. My suitemate and I then talk to our RA and share our stories, but he decides that I should have just sent the picture. Nevertheless, I refuse to send the picture. Since then, one of my suitemates has twisted my ear extremely hard, bent my thumb back, and punched me until I gave him an X-Box controller that was lying beside me. Another suitemate kept punching me hard until I called him ""sir."" My roommate continues to slap me on the face randomly. And that particular suitemate basically kicked me in the stomach as I was walking to my room. Moreover all of them are calling me immature, when my suitemate clearly committed a cyber crime by using my lock code on my phone and coercing me into taking pictures of him. I also believe I was within my rights to charge him ten dollars for the picture as it was my phone camera. Moreover, they battered me, and have continued to verbally abuse me. I'm pretty sure if my suitemate gets caught with a fake ID again, he'll go to prison for identity fraud. This is in Virginia. Am I overreacting? Is there something I can do about this?"

I tried to find the link that i originally clicked on but can't find the link to report it. there is a website located behind the pop up and it is hardpornvalidation.com/5/9/. I cannot see the rest of the link, if there is more to it. underneath the web address it says it is ""Under supervision of FBI, U.S.A Ministry of Interior, Interpol, Copyright Alliance International Cyber Security Protection alliance."" That is all the information i have on it. Please, please, please help. "
