0,cybercrime,legaladvice,[PA] I was scammed out of $700 through Google pay. Bank/Google will likely say I'm out of luck. Any cybercrime/legal/investigative action I could take?,1,i4r6sc,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/i4r6sc/pa_i_was_scammed_out_of_700_through_google_pay/,2020-08-06 22:47:36,"This person went as far as to send a picture of a passport claiming it was them. Unsure if that can add as form of identity fraud/theft based of it was a fake or taken from someone else. Like any one would be I'm pretty upset, but the lack of support from financial institutions makes me want to invest in my own backing. Here's a overview of the interaction: I sought a computer part on reddit. Seller sent a photo of the part I was looking for along with a written note of their username and current date next to the item, per regulation. -Seller requested transaction occur off PayPal due to poor customer support/payment processing after covid -sent me picture of passport as form of ID via imgur ""as sign of good faith"" -sent me another username to contact as reference for a sale he completed (I contacted but ofc this was likely another one of his accounts even though his account was 8 years scarce activity this one 4 years old higher activity) - I requested the serial number and was able to match it to the manufacturer database as still in warranty (EVGA.com) - he sent me additional photos of the hardware I was looking to buy to prove he actually had it in possession (a close up picture of the serial number) -in the Google pay request the serial number of the device is included so there's no questioning what the payment was for. I'm just curious that of in this I interaction there are multiple entities involved. Thinking specifically the closest link I/any investigative backing i have is EVGA.com because unless it's photoshopped and he got the serial code elsewhere I can connect that part to his real identity, because it's registered in their system under warranty. I just want to know if there's any form of small claims or legal cybercrime-esque investigation I could do to try to identity this person."

However he keeps making new accounts and publicly replying to my posts. He never sends a a single direct message in private just the replys and none of them are bad ether. no threats, no sexual comments nothing to point any bad intention however, I wanted no contact with this person but he keeps making comments. This has been going for close to a month now and I keep blocking every account but that means nothing anymore since he keeps creating more. I already filed reports to the FBI cyber team and local police but what are the chances this will actually get prosecuted? And what cybercrime would this fall into?"

All the answers I got from my previous post said that yes this may be creepy and weird but not illegal to justify a cybercrime. So my question is how is this not a cybercrime or what needs to be met for it to become one and for law enforcement to actually get involved enough to prosecute the person."

We have filed multiple police reports but havent heard anything back yet. how long does a cyberstalking investigation usually take before the criminal can be brought to justice? To give a tiny backstory this person have been making nonstop fake accounts on every platform twitter Instagram private chat rooms we have (somehow hes getting into those) and sending messages to my friend none of them are threatening but definitely think this is harassment and keeps trying to contact her and hes still doing it after being told multiple times to stop. it was a known person that use to be a friend so we gave his name address all that to the police. but like I said this has been going on for months now. do they issue a warrant for his arrest or what is a process to get this person to be prosecuted because we are getting tired of waiting so long and trying to deal with him trying to sneak back in on different accounts and sending messages.

Hes already been reported to the police and we even know his full name address, everything but nothings happened. This has caused me to do some research and I am finding tons of stories of people that have experienced being stalked before and every single one of these stories span over the course of years. Even found one that it took them 6 years before it finally stopped and the guy was brought to justice even tho they had piles of evidence with death threats and everything. why does cyberstalking take so long before they can actually charge the person with the crime and go to court and all that? All these people from the stories including my friend has piles of screen shots and different messages sent with death threats and loads of other bad stuff. How with this much evidence it still takes so long? Is it because the message could be from an actual innocent person and just because of the situation the person being stalked thinks every single person is bad and providing incorrect evidence? or some of the stories I read the suspect and victim lives in different states or even a different country. I know laws are different depending where you are but again how does it take years worth of time before anythings done?"

I know this because, among other issues, someone logged into my online bank account and changed the phone number they use to verify the account. I changed all my passwords and took all the precautionary steps for identity theft, and I also filed a police report for this, although I haven't heard back from them yet. &amp;#x200B; In any case, at around the same time this happened, my phone stopped working properly (it's an iPhone). I briefly received a couple strange messages on my phone that looked like they came from someone I know, but didn't. I believe these were ""spoofed"" messages. Furthermore, before factory resetting it, it started sending text messages to the wrong people as to what was showed on the phone itself, on the iMessage texting screen (for lack of a better term). One person confirmed she received messages from me meant for other people, so my phone had obviously been tampered with. I'm frankly a little paranoid fake messages were sent from my phone that I didn't type out. &amp;#x200B; This is obviously connected to the incident, in my opinion. I have a weird suspicion someone I know or work with may have sent some type of spyware on my phone. It's a prepaid cell phone account. I can't seem to get ahold of the phone company, but is there any way I can get them to release a record of my call and text message history? I can't pull them up on my phone because I factory reset it. &amp;#x200B; From my own reading about this, I understand that the police seldom investigate and prosecute this type of cybercrime, but aside from any police inquiry, I want to know who my phone number actually called and texted at the time, so I'll know what was actually sent to and received from my phone. Do I need to have the police or a lawyer do this? In any case, I'd really appreciate any advice anyone has."

Without clicking around, as a courtesy I shot them a quick email from their own email letting them know not to worry but that they left their email logged into on a public computer, that I was logging them out but that it might be a good idea to log out of all devices through Yahoo and reset its password to be safe. I also mentioned that it was pretty dangerous to leave yourself signed in, even within your own community, on a public/shared computer because you never know whose guests might use the computer and potentially see your private information (or worse, use it). I signed as ""- your fellow friendly community member,"" sent it, and that was that. I received an email an hour later from the community center's supervisor who said he noticed that I had signed in to that computer and that he had an upset person who was very scared that he had received an email from himself and wanted to know who had sent it. The supervisor apologized but asked if I would mind reaching out to him and explaining that I did not look at any of his private information or go through his email. I made the wrong decision of reaching out and emailing this nervous fellow and just explained that my email was a courtesy, I was sorry that he was spooked, I did not look at anything in his email - the purpose of my email was to help prevent that from happening, and that I hope he had a better morning. He emailed me back and referenced my state and the federal cybercrime statutes (not citing to a particular provision within them) and said I had rendered myself subject to civil liability. He is pretty angry over the whole ordeal, and though he seemed to just want to threaten me just in case I had seen something in his email that was particularly sensitive (again, I did not look at a single thing in his inbox), I am still a little worried over this and its taking my bandwidth away from being able to study for exams. Is there any legitimacy to this threat? I looked at both statutes and my actions did not fall directly within them. In fact, the definitions within the statutes seemed vague and that combined with what looks like no case law to support that my actions fall within the ""cybercrime"" statutes, I feel as though he just was mad and threw a few laws at me to try to scare me. TLDR: Guy left his email open on a public/shared computer and I emailed him letting him know. He hinted he might sue me and referenced a few cybercrime statutes. Do I need to worry at all?"

Needless to say that i got hacked, it began with trouble sending emails. I had also purchased an applecare support warranty which I paid an extra $200 or so for. Being quite naive I assumed that applecare support would sort out any problems which may arise with my new machine. Oh how wrong I was! Apple care were all good with restoring my email settings so that I could send and receive emails, although the same issue popped up quite often. Since 2014 i have mad approximately 200 calls to applecare support requesting assistance with the constant problems which prevented me from using my machine without interference from hackers. I would have spent well over 200 hours on the phone to applecare attempting to resolve these issues. My key chain was being controlled by the hackers, who were logged into through icloud. This meant that the hackers had access to every single application and password stored on my computer, they were also able to alter my settings, preventing me from using icloud successfully for anything at all myself. By 2015-1016 it was regularly taking me an hour or more just to log into my gmail account. The mail app didn't work successfully at all for sending and receiving important emails so I had to use safari.. but I would just get sent around in circles trying unsuccessfully to login. I couldn't even take screen shots and then copy them to an external drive. Every external HD i used with this machine was remotely reformatted in such a way that i couldn't share any files that I had saved on them, even though they were originally formatted to be mac and PC compatible. It got to the stage where every single sight i visited and every single account I had was impossible to access and/or use properly without being blocked from using the main functionalities. This included Mygov, a supposedly secure government sight on a supposedly secure network on a supposedly secure machine. It got to the stage where I couldn't even save screenshots and move them to an external drive. I was instructed to reinstall the OS on approximately five occasions by applecare consultants, I did this without it achieving any success with improving the functionality of my machine whatsoever. Each time I had to do a reinstall it took several hours to complete the process. I was referred to the apple re seller where I had purchased my machine on several occasions and was charged $100's of dollars to reformat my external devices and be told that my computer had no hardware issues. Applecare paid for this on one occasion but when the problem persisted they refused to keep paying for it, claiming that the they weren't responsible for non apple products. I was shunted from applecare to the re seller and back again constantly, each time i took my machine to the re seller it took me days before I could get it back. In almost every case I was told that it was an applecare issue because it was software related, not hardware. Then I would call applecare and told to either do another reinstall or to take it back to the reseller or into a mac repair center. I once took my machine which clearly had major issues to an official mac repair center in the city, having to waste more of my time yet again and pay $20 for parking only to be told that my machine had no hardware problems. So I was bounced back to applecare once again and instructed to do yet another reinstall. When this failed to improve my machine's functionality I finally decided to create a new apple ID and had to do yet another reinstall. I noticed as the computer was reinstalling that all of these strange files were being either uploaded or downloaded to my machine. In particular XPC files which caused every app on my machine to be controlled almost exclusively by hackers. I called applecare support once again and explaining that my machine wasn't working properly at all after having just spent about six hours doing a fresh reinstall and activating a brand new apple i.d. The consultant had a look from her end and was advised that I was currently logged into my key chain via icloud. I don't even know how to use Keychain, let alone login to it via icloud. I never even used icloud for anything at all apart from attempting to send emails to or from my icloud email address which barely ever worked. I wasn't offered any assistance in dealing with the problem I was experiencing, it was just played down and not even escalated. I have hours of screen recording video capture containing evidence of my machine being hacked and not serving it's purpose. I even have a video screen capture containing evidence of a WAP forum being held through my machine whilst unsuccessfully attempting to download my tax statement from Mygov. My wifi would appear to be switched off while it was actually on but was programmed to appear to be off. I traveled an hour away from my home wifi network on one occasion and noticed that XPC was constantly in use with apps I was using as well as apps that i had never even used for example Face time. My wifi Icon was light grey, indicating that it was switched off but when i clicked on it i only had the option to switch it off. When I chose the option to switch it off I received a message saying that I needed to be granted permission from XPC to turn it off which was impossible. Once again I contacted applecare support and was offered no useful assistance in dealing with the issue whatsoever. The email account attached to my new apple id was hacked and approximately 50 applecare case numbers and notes were deleted. Every single applecare case number was deleted from the email address connected to my previous apple i.d. I called applecare and demanded to speak with customer relations. I spoke with them, requesting that each case number be resent to my email address along with the applicable notes. They ended up sending a bunch of case number's but with no notes describing the actual issues related to the cases. These case numbers were deleted from my email account by hackers shortly after I received them anyway. I found some time after this that most of the numbers from my mobil phone turned up in face time, which I have never actually used to contact anyone at all. When I clicked on these phone contacts which came from my mobil which I had never even connected to the machine it indicated that they had been used in conjunction with AIM (Amrican Instant Messaging) which is owned by AOL. This software is used by networked groups to share video, audio and photo files whilst chatting about them online. I have screenshots containing evidence of my mobil numbers having been used with face time in conjunction with AIM. A few months back both of my email accounts that had been connected with my apple i'd's had been hijacked. My phone showed the email addresses aswell as my icloud address, oddly my profile pics on my icloud email address and my apple i'd address were switched with one another. I called applecare support yet again asking them how I could access this email address. I was advised by the consultant with whom which I spoke to on that occasion that my icloud email account didn't exist on their system at all and was offered no explanation nor assistance with recovering that email address. I requesting to speak with customer relations again. I was queried as to the reason for my request, when i answered them they asked me if it was a legal matter to which I replied yes. they refused to connect me with customer relations, advising me that i would need to submit a request to their legal team. Both of my email addresses that had been connected to my apple i'd's had been hijacked at this stage and my Microsoft laptop had been hacked to the point where i was unable to even switch it on. I used a public library to create a new email address and submit a request for all my applecare case numbers and notes applicable to my most recent apple Id. Have heard nothing back.. it's all been a hugely frustrating and time consuming major headache! I've tried contacting the Police, they just referred me to the acorn website which I have been unsuccessful at submitting a report through for the reason that I can't find a computer that I'm not being hacked on. I know for a fact that these hackers are part of an extremely powerful and dangerous organized crime syndicate. They have been making my life more then extremely difficult for the past six years now. I can name and identify at least twelve of the perps but have limited evidence apart from cybercrime. They have committed a long list of crimes against me including extortion and other much more serious crimes. I can not afford a lawyer and have already tried legal aid who were useless to me. Does anyone have any helpful legal advice for this issue?"

Now, once I got my Case number for the police, I was on them about it every 2 weeks or so, to get updates on progress. end of last month they said he had pleaded guilty, and would have to pay restitution in full. they also said give it around 28 days for all his payments and restitution documents and other stuff to go through with SPER (state penalty enforcement agency) and that after that 28 days I will be compensated for my loss. Fast forward to yesterday, I ring up give them all my details and state what had happened and what I was after.

I need legal advice on how to deal with the following user as Ive reported abuse that me and 40-50+ people have received online on Tumblr from this one user, and nothing has been resolved. A few of us tried to report harassment to the users citys police department and all our online reports got rejected. To put this into context - this user online has sent more than 1 message to us, which amounts to 100-200+ messages of online abuse collectively. One person has made lengthy reports to moderators on tumblr and nothing has happened. I can send you links of examples of abuse we have gotten - but this contains the username of the abuser, and the same abuser is active on Reddit too - which isnt great. I might be stirring the pot again and bringing the heat back on me, and I really dont want that. Im not sure if I should do so, because the user in question knows my reddit username. The user is also active on twitter and 4chan in the videogames section, /v/ - I think, and users on 4chan got so irritated that they were basically going to ban this user from being in their forum. On twitter - they are constantly @ing videogame developers of the dmc games and irrationally criticising them for how bad a certain character is and how bad the writing is. Theyve been doing it on tumblr on peoples fanart and headcanons - and when many people have been telling them to chill or to stay away if its bothering them, a lot of people would get hateful anons and messages from them. The content of the messages tends to contain: 1. Homophobia 2. Racism 3. Transphobia 4. Ableism Misogyny Misandry Islamophobia Death threats Rape threats Threats of violence Neonazi syntax and dogwhistle terms Baiting people into making anti-semitic comments so they could lash out more at them. Essentially - the extreme content of these messages is due to the fact that other users were telling them to chill out, and if you ever so slightly disagreed with them theyd lash out and say extremely hurtful things to users. I only discovered the users horrible actions because about a month ago - they told me they were deactivating their account (a lie) and were going to be more active on reddit. They told me that Id need to block a list of 40-50+ people which they divided into primary and secondary harrassers, some of which were strangers and some who I was friends with longer than Ive known the user. I personally thought it was sketchy as hell - and turns out the list if people were victims of the user, and were extremely nice as well. As I got lied to - and at the time I thought we were friends, I called them out on it to stick up for my friends and now Im roped into this mess and it sucks. I dont know what to do now. Do you guys know legal advice for cybercrime stuff if I give you evidence to prove these claims? Thanks."

One of our product supplier's (based in Italy) email account was compromised and we received an email from them for an invoice payment with a hacker's bank account details (which had a beneficiary name identical to the real supplier's). The email was actually sent from a real company email belonging to the supplier, with all the relevant signatures and obviously the scammer worked to make it look like a real company worker sent it. We wired the money. The supplier notified us two weeks later by email that they were compromised and that the money is lost, ""nothing we can do about it"". My questions: 1. Who's liable here, us or the supplier whose email was compromised? A cursory online search showed that they are responsible. If so, we're planning on suing them. 2. Should we retain an Israeli, an Italian or an otherwise ""international"" lawyer that specializes in cybercrime? 3. Where can we find such a lawyer that understand the difference between phishing scams (for which I understand we would be liable) and BEC scams (for which I understand the supplier is responsible since they were compromised)? 4. The supplier was extremely slow and did not perform due diligence - the fake emails were CC'd with real employee's addresses but they didn't raise red flags, and we notified the supplier about the suspicious activity about 5 days after wiring the money but they just said they're ""looking into it"". They still took two weeks to tell us that they were compromised. Could we hold them liable for the slow response? Faster responses would've allowed us to cancel the wire. Thank you very much.

I was caught red handed, and insulted her by name calling her when it happened. &amp;#x200B; I sent her two apology emails in the months to come using my real name.

I have OCD, so I have a tendency to panic over the littlest of things.

Seeing no way to resolve my panic, I emailed her about it. I have a tendency to blog as well, so I blogged about this. I didn't mention her name or address or any personal information, but discussed how contraceptives might fail and how pregancy can happen even with the use of condoms, etc, and if the ""said person"" had told me about it I would have helped her through the process, whatever her decision. As it turns out, she frequented my blog and saw that post. She not only replied to the email(harshly) but equated my act to revenge pornography. I immediately deleted my blog post and even my blog. &amp;#x200B; She is scared of my online behavior(understandably) and due to my mental illness, does not trust me.

Im suspecting that perhaps there is no money left at all in the estate or its been laundered or hidden or even gambled away (the person is a gambling addict according to his friends). So far the executor has gotten off without any consequence for their actions simply because they have not responded to myself or my lawyers and as I dont know their current address anymore, I cannot serve them court order documents (they were evicted from their house). What makes things worse is that recently, I was sent a sum of money that was later reported as stolen funds - the bank froze my account and wouldnt unfreeze it until I agreed that this money could be returned to the person who sent the money. I have no idea if the money was actually stolen but what I am lead to believe is that there was a business that transferred the funds over and that the business then reported the transactions as fraudulent. I am not sure if this implies that the executor has a business and they simply abused the system to freeze my accounts as it is possible that she has seen the numerous emails sent to her by my lawyer and wanted to halt my legal proceedings by freezing my account. I have no idea what I can do and this is really starting to leave me quite stressed, anxious and depressed as I feel so helpless to come to any kind of solution. The weeks my bank account was frozen were incredibly stressful and the fact that I cannot hold anyone accountable for that is salt to injury. I reported this matter to the local authorities who referred me to ACORN (which is the Australia Cybercrime unit) but they have decided not to take action at this time. My lawyer is currently busy with other aspects of this case which is already costing me a significant amount. Is there anything I can do to get further information about how this happened and also try to get more control over this situation? I tried to exercise my right to information to the bank when they were investigating, but privacy laws prevent me obtaining any case notes. It is proving to be impossible without knowing where this person lives and serving them legal documents that would enforce action to have anything done. They might even be moving country but hopefully I can get them with the documents before then. I thought that not they would have broken the law since they did not abide by the Will but it seems like nothing is being done by police or other legal authorities (except for my lawyer of course). TL;DR: Executor of estate has been avoiding legal consequences but not replying and looks like Im SOL because I dont have an address to serve them documents and they continue to (what is essentially) abuse / torment me by screwing me around.

Since approx last December, by ex has been accessing my old Facebook as well as my email addresses. He created multiple fake female accounts with fake profile pictures slandering me to people I had just met, he sent people private conversations I had had with other people, things like that. He also managed to remotely locate and completely erase all data on my new phone I just got for Christmas last year. I didn't even know that remote location software was turned on. It's definitely off now. I have made a new Facebook account (completely private) and a new email address, and I have changed all my passwords and phone number. I have basically done everything I can to ensure he cannot access my new accounts, including updating my gas/electricity company etc with my new email address and number. My old email addresses are a bit trickier, however. One he has completely gained access to and has changed all the security info. I changed the password on this email several times to no avail. I couldn't turn on two factor authentication as I had to update the account with a new mobile number, which takes 30 days for some reason. So I abandoned it. But I have just checked another email I barely use and it turns out he has been accessing it (again, I changed passwords and it didn't work. I appealed to Microsoft to help and they said they couldn't do anything). I have his IP address after looking at the activity history, and guess where it leads? Right to where he lives. It is definitely him. Facebook also once alerted me to an unauthorised login and they gave me the same IP address. He also uses a windows PC to access my info, whereas I always use my phone. When I contacted the police, they said I have no recourse to do anything. Even though he even tried to access my bank account (again, all details changed) and I gave them the IP address. They said because he technically hasn't broken a law, they can't do anything. This is in Scotland by the way. I understand that laws haven't really caught up to cybercrime as of yet in all its forms, but I feel so powerless and angry. I'm also worried he'll keep finding my new email addresses and gaining access somehow, even though I used a completely new password. I know where he lives, but he knows where I do as well, and I would be in the wrong if I physically went over to his house. I have told his sister and mother about what he is doing, but he's still accessing my information. This is two years after we broke up by the way. So, can I do anything except just wait and see if it escalates or he gets bored? Thanks for any advice in advance, and apologies for the length!"

My email service has documented these instances and notified me, allowing me to secure my email and change my password without giving the unauthorized party access. They have also provided me with the IP address of the device that attempted the unauthorized access. Steps that I have taken and their outcomes: 1) Use a third party service to determine details about the IP I obtained. The perpetrator is located in Los Angeles, CA. Additional information cannot be obtained without paying massive service fees or an official request from police. 2) Contacted cyber crimes division of the LAPD. A detective told me that since I, the victim, am in Portland, OR, I need to file a police report with Portland PD. 3) Go to the police station in Portland, OR to file a report. They said I can only file a report online. 4) Go to file the police report online. There is no adequate category online to describe my situation. Click on ""Other,"" and it says I need to file the report in person. 5) Contact non-emergency services for clarification on how to file the report. They said to use the category of ""theft"" online. 6) Try again online. The ""theft"" category is completely irrelevant to this incident and virtually impossible to fill out given the circumstances. Almost all questions it asks are not applicable. So, how do I document and report this crime? It's only a matter of time before whoever is doing this gets my new password and finds a way to circumvent the gmail security features. Everyone I spoke to (except the cyber crimes detective in CA) was so apathetic I even started to doubt whether it was a crime to access someone else's email.

I was a part of a social club via facebook and whatnot. I purchased a domain name with blessing from said club nd also webhosting on my personal wix account for premium access and domain forwarding. In addition i set-up a g-mail account (linked to my personal e-mail) as well as an instagram account. I (as an individual) also designed logos and such to give out to certain people in the club for various uses with MY blessing to use them. For personal reasons (mostly bullying from one person and other different stressors) I left said club. This club had never been incorporated or was there any documentation with signatures releasing my ownership of said Domain name and web hosting at THIS time. There are no signatures on any paperwork stating so as well. I've tried to be civil with the individual who was the main reason for my leaving (aggresor), but all I would start getting is messages saying that they own the website etc. and it's not my property. In good faith, I allowed access to the majority of aforementioned accounts etc. to people that I felt would better handle the workload in my absence. Keyword: access - I still own the domain and I'm still paying for the premium site creator plan (of which I can fully transfer to my personal website). When I was debating to quit, I thought since the website hosting and domain are mine, that it would be appropriate to temporarily unpublish the website until the argument amongst the leadership was over. If it was a positive outcome I would, allow access to it, if not I'd just shut it down. Low and behold I see a ""Cease and Desist"" e-mail from a certain party's ""lawyer"" stating that all the things that I had done for this club were owned by this individual and/or club. and something about violating commerce law and cybercrime - not only that but it states that the violations are of a law in another state where the domain name and domain name owner clearly do not live? Is an e-mail a legal way to serve a cease and desist? There are no documents or communication saying that I relinquished ownership of any of the things I paid for - only that I would allow access and help while a member of said club. In fear, I have allowed access to my domain name and my web-hosting while waiting for an answer from a lawyer friend of a fellow associate has retained. Their legal counsel says there are no actual grounds for any such type of lawsuit or cease and desist and that this is a scare tactic because the one party is mad. He (my friend with the business lawyer) advised me that I don't have to worry about anything and to keep my receipts and not respond to anyone associated with this club (which I have). I don't have the money to seek legal advice. My phone was inundated with phone calls and messages from the ""agressor"", so I blocked their phone number in my phone. I then was also receiving similar messages on facebook through multiple people and numerous times felt threatened or harassed - I have since temporarily deactivated facebook.

Now I see how this applies to say using someone's credit card to make a purchase - Could this also be argued to apply to private keys and obtaining data?

Which has made this situation even more shocking. Currently his mother can only get in touch with him through the state attorney. As I understand, the state attorney has said that no details about the investigation will be given until it is concluded, which could take around 6 months. During this time the person will be in custody and apperantly the minimum charge he is facing is 10 years in prison. In short we have no idea of why and what is happening and would like know what can we do to make this situation more clearer/better. I would really appreaciate any amount of advice. Thank you."

This person is telling the business that they will only unlock it when they receive their last paycheck, which is a couple of weeks away. This computer contains all the financial business data of the business. Things like payroll information and client financial data. The company was planning on just letting it go, before the employee then called a government agency and decided to report small non-compliance issues. You can take my word for it (or not) if I say its minor, non-illegal activities. The former employee has decided to enlist the aid of other employees to report on what the management is doing and saying in response. I know for a fact the computer incident is definitely a cybercrime. This is in Washington State. Management is not sure what to do and is small enough to not have a lawyer on retainer. Do they meet with a lawyer first and let them sort it out? Or should the first call be to the police? Thanks!"

According to Federal CAN-SPAM regulations all marketing e-mails require certain bits of info ... addresses, phone numbers, etc... One of the more salient requirements is an UNSUBSCRIBE link. Plenty of Fish has an UNSUBSCRIBE link in their e-mails, but they require one to LOG IN to their account in order to unsubscribe. Unfortunately, I do not know the login credentials because it's not my account... it's just my e-mail address which is associated with the account.

This is a bit of an interesting situation. Location: Idaho. Last month my fiancee and I were shopping for cars. We test drove a car from **[Dealership Alpha]** and ended up not buying it because they wouldn't negotiate low enough. At the time, that was the first and only car dealer I'd gone to. As we'd reached the credit check / negotiation stage, I'd given them my social security number, phone number, and other personal information, and signed their privacy policy. The next morning, I got a call from a car salesman I had never worked with, who was making references to my ""deal falling through"" the previous day. He knew what kind of car I was looking at the day prior, knew my name, obviously knew my phone number (as I NEVER give that out - four people have my number), etc. As I talked to him, I quickly realized that he was not with **[Dealership Alpha]**, but with **[Dealership Bravo]**, their biggest competitor. He started asking what **[Alpha]** was wanting for that car and assured me he could get a better price. I started to smell a rat, so I looked up his phone number and found a Facebook page associated with this salesman, which confirmed his name and that he worked for **[Dealership Bravo]**. I have NEVER given my number or any other personal information to **[Dealership Bravo]**, and at that time the only car dealer I'd shopped with was **[Dealership Alpha]**. I used to work in private-sector digital forensics and taught a cybercrime class at the local university as an adjunct for two years, so naturally I was concerned that a data breach occurred. I contacted **[Dealership Alpha]** and was told they were ""looking into it."" The salesman I had worked with informed me that this was absolutely against their privacy policy (which I signed), and they didn't know where or how the leak happened. That was about a month ago. Today I received a text from the salesman at **[Alpha]** apologizing for the breach and informing me that they determined it was likely an employee listening in and feeding the information to the guy at **[Bravo]**. That employee was apparently terminated and now works for **[Bravo]**. They offered me a ""good deal"" on a car for the trouble, but now I'm more concerned as to the security of my personal information. I don't know where my personal information went, or how it was used, or especially if my social security number is compromised. Obviously this is an unethical practice, but I imagine it must be illegal as well. As of this morning I've filed a police report as well as an FTC complaint, but I'm curious as to whether I have standing for civil legal action, or whether I should care. Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks for being a great community."

We'll call my friend Sarah. Sarah manages a (chain) retail store where one of her employees (Emily) has been skating on thin ice. Emily has been written up a multitude of times for everything from rude interactions with customers to faking a family emergency. Undeterred by disciplinary actions, Emily continues to act inappropriately and the inevitable happens; Emily is terminated. Being a rational and responsible adult, Emily goes home and reflects on her actions, considering the role she played in her own demise. Lol JK the next thing she does is create a series of posts on the personal pages of Craigslist pretending to be Sarah. She makes several ads seeking sexual activity as 'Sarah' in which she provides Sarah's full name and phone number. Sarah's phone is soon flooded with disgusting and disturbing messages and calls. Eventually, one of the creeps mentions he'd seen her post on Craigslist. Finding the post took some time but eventually she was able to find a live copy which was documented appropriately (page saved offline, archived, printed as pdf, physical, etc.). Evidently Emily isn't the brightest bulb, having used a revealing picture of herself in the post where she is impersonating Sarah. A few reverse image searches and usernames used across websites later, there's a neat and tidy digital paper trail pinning Emily to the posts. This evidence is packaged up and delivered to the local police. The officer handling the case contacted my friend earlier this week to inform her that they had made the arrest and are charging her with Cyber Harassment. SO! Wonderful people of Legal Advice, I come to you with the question of what else can be done. Forgive me if I'm wrong (IANAL obviously) but aren't there civil charges that can be pursued? In addition, is there anything on top of CyberCrime (4th Degree) Emily can be charged with for this? I know it may not seem like a huge deal but the entire ordeal caused Sarah a great deal of stress and misery. Constant sexual harassment from strangers is pretty awful to experience and one shouldn't have to change their number after firing someone for not doing their damn job. **TLDR: Employee gets fired, responds by impersonating manager who fired her, posting phone # and personal info on Craigslist ads looking for sex, is there anything in addition to Cyber Harassment she can be charged w/ ?**"

This week after being told for the 5th time that there was a problem sending me money, I decided to put his site up for maintenance, remove all my code and tell him this is because he owes me money.

Something like this: URL By substituting the ""1234"" for anyone's lunch ID, you could view their recent lunch purchases (with timestamps), their parents name, and their name. I was a novice web-developer, and being the stupid teenager I was, I wrote a javascript (or lua, not sure anymore. been a while) script that tried some IDs and made it output to an html file and put a little bit of a basic stylesheet on it. I showed some friends, all was cool. I showed my favorite teacher and they said it was cool, but to knock it off. So I did. Sometime after that, I added wrote an image host for my website, similar to imgur, under a URL similar to img.myname.me. This site contains some screen shots, sound files, some text files, and is primarily used for my web-developer portfolio. When I was putting all of my pictures and snippets on the site, I guess I accidentally included the output file (which was named something innocuous like E7zga1lpA.html) Fast forward to 3 years later. I've graduated college, found a decently well paying job in my field, and have just become engaged to my fiance. One day at work, I am pulled aside by the president of the company, saying I have ""guests"", with a stern look on his face. I follow him to one of our conference rooms, which contains 2 police officers and I guess one of their ""cybercrime"" detectives. Of course I have no idea why they're there so I greet them and divulge my personal details for them. They begin recording the interaction, and asking if I know why they're there. I say no, they ask if I'm sure. Yup. They go into detail about how some concerned parent found their kid's name on my image hosting site. Not sure how the document was found to begin with, seeing as the directory itself was password protected, but I digress. I explained (in as best detail as possible after not touching it for a few years) what the script did and how it worked. It was a couple lines of code that viewed the webpage. They were basically accusing my of breaking in to the school's servers / SQL databases and selling the information for profit. They asked me if I've given the information away. They ask me if I have credit card numbers and social security numbers. I tell the complete truth - I haven't touched the script I wrote since high-school, I would never knowingly post anyone's personal information (as personal as names and balances get), and I would never steal. The cop even asked if a ""student could *potentially* buy lunch using someone else's lunch number"". About halfway through the discussion, the most tech person casually mentions that they've got SWAT and POLICE in my apartment, seizing my computers. I give them my usernames and passwords for my NAS and computers, because I've got nothing to hide. I told them that I'm not even sure if the script that we were talking about even exists on it any more. They seized my phone, a whole bunch of old dead laptops (I used to do freelance tech support for friends / family), my computers, and my fiance's computer. The only *potentially* illegal thing on any of my stuff is a pirated game or two - no hacking scripts, no detestable content, nothing. It's been a few days and I've heard nothing back from anyone. I've still got some underpowered PCs and my surface tablet and of course my workstation at my job. Our landlord hasn't quite evicted us, but our lease expires in January and they explicitly said ""we will NOT renew your lease."", which I completely understand. I would act the same way. So now we've got two months to find, look at, be approved for, and to move in to a new apartment. My fiance will be using her information just in-case something criminal does happen to me. I'm just at a complete loss. I thought I was starting off my life correctly but if anything comes of this I'm going to lose my job, and probably be unable to get a job in the tech field ever again. What should I do? Are the police actively monitoring our internet connection? (we had a spare router lying around, got it working) Are they monitoring my new phone? (needed one for my job, and for other obvious reasons) Please help."

They provided me with a fake ID and the only (real) contact info was an email address. It turned out it was a scam and I never got payed. I reported the scam to the police and asked them if I could use the program I sent them to find their identity, am I allowed to do this, and the police said yes. So I got the ip address, network name and username of the person who was running the program I had made for them. I guess they found out I had done this (maybe by monitoring network traffic) and are claiming I gave them a virus which has infected critical company computers. Can I possibly be on the wrong side of the law? To be clear, I modified the program they had refused to pay me for so that it would report back to me the ip address, username and network of the computer it was run on. Could this be considered stealing personal information? I know ip address is considered public info but I'm not sure about the username. (the police told me this was ok to do, but I realize it's hard for a nontechnical person to understand what's going on and laws are extremely outdated when it comes to internet and cybercrime). Does it make a difference the program was stolen in the sense it was never paid for? I mean could someone ""steal"" a program from someone and then sue them because it damaged their computer? This is in Canada. I just want to walk away at this point as the original agreement was only for $300 and I've already spent more time trying to get paid then it took to make the program in the first place. I now know it was a bad idea to give them the program before getting paid, but let's save that discussion for another time ;) UPDATE: I agree it's a silly question, just making sure as they're threatening me with legal action now. Of course the program was not ""malicious"" or ""a virus"". The only thing it did outside of the specifications was report back to me info to identify (since they didn't pay and lied about their id). I am afraid of going to court as I don't want to waste money or time. TL;DR no the program isn't ""malware"" in that it doesn't mess up the computer. "

About a year before, she had been in a terrible car wreck. She had some brain damage, and serious injuries that left her with a lot of chronic pain. For that she takes pain killers. I wanted to say that before the trolls start piling on her. Yes, she made a mistake. The above accident forced her to retire early, and with a lot of medical debts. She negotiated payment plans and in some cases, reduced settlements, but there was still a lot. She saw online a website advertising unsecured loans. She mistook them for a reputable firm she had dealt with years ago. She filled out an application, which gave away her personal information. The ""lender"" deposited money into her account, using photocopies of checks, stolen from someone else, drawn against an account that person had closed, with forged signatures. These checks were signed over to my wife. This came in two deposits, about a week apart. The bank credited the money to her account, and unknowingly, she paid bills with it. When the bank discovered the checks were no good, they debited her account for the two deposits, totaling $8000. We took all the legal steps we were advised to take; closed that account, filed a police report, an FBI report, a Consumer Finance Protection Bureau report, and an FTC report. The scammers continued to open new accounts using her information. As advised, she furnished the creditors with the police report #, and her story was corroborated by LE, so those accounts weren't collectible. The accounts opened by the scammers did appear on her credit report, but were set aside by the credit bureaus with the same supporting information. We learned that the people who did this were very familiar to Law Enforcement. They spoofed phone numbers, I.P.'s, used multiple names and web sites, etc. making them difficult to trace. So far, they had been tracked only to a geographic area. Now here is my question. the credit union said she was liable for the full amount, and had to repay it, which she did. The credit union's stated reason was that she was liable because the fraudulent deposits were made by using a cell phone to make a copy of a real, stolen check, signed over to her, and drawn against a closed account that had belonged to a third person. They said if it had been done by any other method they, not my wife, would have been liable. That's the part I don't understand. I had some checks stolen by one of my kid's friends years ago, and the bank did make good on the stolen funds. So why would a cell phone copy of a stolen third party check, with a forged signature that didn't even match my wife's be so different? If this is true, anybody with a checking account is potentially vulnerable. My wife has other questions, like why did they credit the second deposit, after what seems like an adequate amount of time to have caught the first one? Also, we both have our checking accounts with this institution. If either of us signs a check over to the other, they require us both to appear, with ID to make the deposit. That seems inconsistent with their handling of the cell phone copies. My account was not involved in any way. Trust me I have searched for an attorney who could advise us on this. The ones who handle credit and lending cases didn't want it because it was a ""cybercrime"". The ones who handle cybercrime didn't want it because it involved the credit and lending system. The main thing I'd like to know is, did the credit union tell us the truth, that some rule or exception exists that exempts them from guaranteeing the funds in this case? I've always understood that once the funds are credited they are insured by the FDIC, or some such. Maybe it is different with a credit union? We'd appreciate any usable advice or information. An attorney in this area willing to take the case would be swell."

Yesterday the guy made a mistake and I found him (everything except his SSN basically) and a lot more evidence, including how much he's earning from his illegal activity. ($3000/month) Where do I report someone running a botnet with thousands of infected PC's, which he uses to make thousands of dollars a month, if he lives in Toronto, Canada? Simply googling does not give a clear answer who I mail the tip to with evidence. The Toronto PD doesn't have a cybercrime division, and it seems the division responsible for cybercrime is the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which also seems a bit weird."

She asked me if I could track down who it was, so I agreed thinking it was an ex boyfriend or something. Well I somehow got into the gmail account(Yeah surprised me too). Upon doing so I found about 400 emails of this guy sextorting girls and other women. So I immediately locked down the account and removed the recovery email so the guy couldn't back into it. So I wrote down the information and sent all of it to the FBI cybercrime tip site. Well I happened to look up the email I got into today and I found several articles and court documents showing the guy was sentenced and charged a couple months ago due to the tip I submitted. Am I at risk due to me accessing the account at some point in time? I used the same IP I access the account with to send the cybercrime tip so hopefully that should show I was just trying to help. Thanks so much! "

He had told me a random password of his a few months back. I tried that on his email and it worked. I managed to get access to his facebook account. I didn't see any of his emails, messages or post anything that may harm his image. I just logged out after a few minutes. He got access back and wrote a status that he will report to police. He didn't know it was me. I was under-18 then. Several people in my locality share a connection. The person paying the bill got a cybercrime letter today. I read my country's cyber bill and the lowest punishment is 3 years jail + $3000 fine. Would/can he or me get into any trouble? There is no proof who did it. On whom will the blame go?

It is a Hungarian website for older people (who's data should be the most protected anyway) I successfully exploited one of them to install a PHP shell. Anyway, then i discover that their mysql admin password (a user that can see and control everything in the database) is empty, so there goes their user data protection, i then also escalate to the admin user (this time not only the database admin, but the whole system admin) so there goes their whole system. I also discover that their web directory contain all sorts of stupid files (one of them is called dick.php and it displays 'dick' on when executed). And then i find out people have installed backdoors on the site before. Anyway i of course notify them, both using my email and then Facebook. At 11/20/2015 around 15 they quietly read my facebook message and remove all the backdoors and (try) to fix their vulnerabilities. As time passes, no response, but they blocked my IP, i then message them that they shouldn't block my IP, as i didn't want to do anything wrong. Then suddenly they reply this on facebook ' Dear laci420 or whatever you're called; ' The found security vulnerabilities in now way allow you to cause problems in our website or illegally steal our users data. We will take the appropriate measures against you using our lawyears who have been already notified. Merry Christmas, CompanyName' Then i receive this email from a disposable email address, titled 'huston we have a problem'. They have linked my facebook, my school's website, and my horrible old youtube channel, and have stated the cybercrime part of the Belgian law and the punishment (2-6 years in prison, up to 200k euros) They also state that the website was defaced (wtf, it wasnt) And they mention that i wont be able to get a job ever in Europe. What should i do guys? TLDR; Found vulnerability, sucessfully got user data (= showed it to them on their website using the shell), got root, told about them about it on facebook, they are lawyering up, just sent me email containing the local laws about hacking and how i'll go to jail. EDIT: I should also mention i kind of 'threatened' them with going to the media."

I don't know how they got my password, so I'm also concerned they may also have access to my PC / IP info. Now I'm worried I'm gonna wake up to police breaking down my door seizing my computer &amp; throwing me in prison with no recourse. I was wondering, is use of an email address/IP Address all thats needed to prosecute a cybercrime like child pr0n? Or would they actually physically have to find something on my harddrive if it were confiscated?"

The conversations for the last three months have been monitored by me, but prior to that, she was not living with me, and I had no knowledge of the relationship. Since their breakup, he hacked her facebook account (she's unfortunately not very smart, and used the same password for multiple places.) her instagram, her skype, and her email account. He changed all the passwords, and started posting online, as her, a lot of sexually explicit pictures my daughter had sent him at some point, along with a couple of videos. roughly 20 in total. I only noticed because it popped up on my facebook feed. Her biological father noticed too, and much conversation was had. He's not technically minded, so doing damage control became my department. After many conversations with social media outlets, I've regained access to all her accounts, and deleted the majority of the offending pictures that I could find, reset passwords, added two factor authentication, and picked more secure passwords. However, the question still remains of what to do about all this because of a few nagging questions: First, I know he's still in possession of those pictures. Being over the age of 18, wouldn't that make him in possesion of child pornography? Even though she sent them willingly and knowingly? Second, how do I stop him from re-accessing those accounts, or otherwise posting those pictures elsewhere? Is there something I can do? Thankfully, I had suspected something like this would happen at the start of the relationship, so I managed to get his full name, his age, his home address, and his mothers phone number as well as his pre-paid cellphone number right at the beginning and i've saved that email. I called the local PD in his area, and they said it has to be handled through the proper channels and to contact high tech crimes division here in california. I put that call in about 45 minutes ago, and i'm waiting for a call back. I also contacted his mother, but she was at work and did not have time to talk, so I plan on calling her later (that should be a fun conversation.) to discuss if she was aware of what her son has been doing. I'm not looking to put him in prison for the rest of his life. I just want to know he's deleted all those pictures and will leave my step-daughter alone. I know that if he IS in possession of child pornography by some sort of federal law, he's probably looking at jail time anyway, and possibly being registered as a sex offender. Are there other things I can do? Anything I should be doing to prepare a case, so to speak? I'm kind of hoping the discussion with the mother later this afternoon will yield more positive results than a conversation with high tech crimes division... but I just want to make sure i'm covering all my bases. Thoughts? Advice? This is my first time dealing with this sort of situation. "

When they reimage the computer, it doesn't allow the other students to test on the computer.

One is a 40 y/o woman (allegedly a woman) willing to book flights/hotel room to meet in person for sex and she is aware that he is 15. So now have in my hands a phone with four or five potential felony cases in it's little memory banks. In my career have worked as a cybercrime investigator and have helped to put child molesters in jail--I could easily track down these people and discover their locations and identities, that's something I am really good at. * Is it stupid to want to run with this? * Part of me is *so pissed* that I want to go after these folks, but of course do not want to add to the shame/hurt of my son over his parents dsicovering what he is doing online. * Without going into details, it's some heavy-duty hard-core fetish stuff. * would assume in order for law enforcement to run with this they would need to do a forensic capture of the phone? * Also would assume that an adult asking to engage in sex with a minor over the internet is a crime, however is not something that is easy to prosecute (since the perpetrator may have no knowledge of the age/identity of the victim and distance/jurisdictions )? * Am also concerned about the effects of this on my son...if he would be called to testify and so forth. * I would assume it would be a waste of time to bundle-up this evidence and drop it anonymously into the lap of an investigator as it would be inadmissable.
