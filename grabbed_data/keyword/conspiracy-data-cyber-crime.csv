Zarathustra started the 321 religions after stealing the lesbo lizard's magic mushrooms. Now the sheeple will be as mistreated as the livestock who fell us. The lesbo lizards lost their men to circle jerk asphyxia poker. The first life on earth was Phil McCrackin, a gay space fungi, because everybody knows when you smell earth in your hands it smells gay. The way we strip mine soil for food is killing Phil McCrackin. It's turning soil straight, into poison. Nobody funds cross contaminated systems. The soil, rivers, streams, trees, bees, are in high disruption perturbation. Which is circle jerk speak for, we're fucked. The cognitive and reproductive degradation cannot be stopped or reversed across generations when the source of the poison are called ""forever chemicals"". Poisons that last forever do 2 things besides kill you, they fuck up your mind and turn men into shemales. This happens on a spectrum to both insects and vertebrates. That's what poisons do. They fuck up species propagation. That's what it is and that's how it's done. In the old days we had peasants and slaves but coal and oil allowed freedom and its afterbirth, prosperity. Women pretending they're men is fine, but not in the legal sense because hate crime and copyright laws are obscene. They say life is not Twitter, it's death. It's the same way the lesbo lizards lost their men to circle jerk asphyxia. The only thing worst than Trump, priests and physicists is a rich liberal. Feminists run the deep state MIC tax tit sucking contest. Men are just the tits on a bull. The New York gay mafia took over Washington's credit and currency privilege 100 years ago. This may shock you, but money and sex are being used against you for people to get rich. And worse shock yet clothe nappies don't go in the toilet. The way to stop conspiracy and corruption is to remove the private wealth incentive. You tax private wealth and give 100% back to the poor phased in on stun over 10 years. This will kill the binary political monotony and get shit done. If the MIC MSM don't die earth do. And this time earth won't be fine without us because an ocean acidification supernova is prognosis positive going forward before 2100. The energy boom of the last 100 years is unlike anything ever felt heard or seen on earth ever before since the birth of life itself. You can't have green energy and AI lizard drones. The data surveillance economy won't last forever and it's inimical to life continuing as we know. The shock of this much ice moving to the equator will waken polar volcanoes and tilt the whole eastern continent into the sea. The north pole's ozone and Greenland melt pulse every 10 years, which means 5 years going forward. The ozone blanket never stopped depleting and the magnetic field is shrinking ever faster every five years. We don't do inter-sectional toxicity studies. Everybody's toxic. The black kids digging our cobalt are starving, while educated rich liberals how white whitey is for president. This may come as a shock your beliefs and ideals are exploited and used against your best interest by smart educated people. It's been going on for 100 years. We are conspiring to collapse because we are greedy pigs who want to be rich. If you put three monkeys in a cage with food, the three binary monopoly power switches on. This is all because our technical grasp exceeds our social grasp. Once we upload our minds onto the gay cyberfrog construct we can burn the pigloos in the Arctic cyber boar war. I bet the gay cyber frogs will dominate the earth in Russia and Canada, once nearly everything else dies. Only 4% of animals are wild, and when billions die from Gates date virus getting ratioed on the facts won't matter in the end."

What is Q? And, perhaps most importantly, why is Q? Q and the ever-growing worldwide movement its inspired have been the objects of fascination, mockery and hatred, but of surprisingly little serious analysis. Q first appeared in October 2017 on an anonymous online forum called 4Chan, posting messages that implied top-clearance knowledge of upcoming events. More than 3,000 messages later, Q has created a disturbing, multi-faceted portrait of a global crime syndicate that operates with impunity. Qs followers in the QAnon community faithfully analyze every detail of Qs drops, which are compiled [here](URL and [here](URL The mainstream media has published hundreds of [articles](URL attacking Q as an [insane rightwing conspiracy](URL particularly after President Trump seemed to publicly confirm his connection to it. At a North Carolina [rally](URL in 2019, Trump made a point of drawing attention to a baby wearing a onesie with a big Q. In recent weeks, the tempo of Trumps spotlighting of Q has accelerated, with the President retweeting Q followers twenty times in one day. Trump has featured Q fans in his [ads](URL and deployed one of Qs signature phrases (These people are sick) at his rallies. The Presidents lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has also retweeted Q followers. Q has noted that the media never asks Trump the obvious question: What do you think of Q? To Q followers, the reason they dont ask is obvious. Theyre afraid of the answer. In the meantime, Qs influence continues to spread. Protestors in Hong Kong, Iran, and France have held up Q signs and chanted Q quotes. Qs revelations are uniting people all over the world who want freedom. If youre unfamiliar with Q or only know it through the medias attacks, Id like to provide a brief introduction to this extraordinary phenomenon. Ive followed Q since the first drop, and Ive grown increasingly impressed by the accuracy, breadth and depth of Qs messages. Q followers were prepared long in advance for the easing of hostilities with North Korea, the deflation of the mullahs of Iran, and the discovery of Ukraine as a hotbed of corruption for American politicians. They knew a great deal about Jeffrey Epsteins activities before the public did and anticipate even more shocking revelations to come. As Q likes to say, Future proves past. As Qs predictions come true, they lend retroactive credibility to the entire enterprise. Qs followers believe that Q is a military intelligence operation, the first of its kind, whose goal is to provide the public with secret information. Many Q followers think the Q team was founded by Admiral Michael Rogers, the former Director of the National Security Agency and former Commander of US Cyber Command. Some suspect that Dan Scavino, White House Director of Social Media, is part of the team, because the high quality of Qs writing has the luster of a communications expert. Q is a new weapon in the game of information warfare, bypassing a hostile media and corrupt government to communicate directly with the public. Think of Q as a companion to Trumps twitter. Whereas Trump communicates bluntly and directly, Q is cryptic, sly and subtle, offering only clues that beg for context and connection. Heres the way it works: Q posts messages (also known as drops or crumbs) on an anonymous online forum, which are discussed, analyzed, and critiqued by the boards inhabitants. (The forum has changed a few times after massive online attacks.) Hundreds of social media accounts then spread Qs latest posting to worldwide followers who share their research, analysis, and interpretations of Qs latest information. Ive compiled a list of Qs most famous catch phrases and tried to put them into context. **The Great Awakening:** Were living in a unique time in which ordinary citizens around the world are collaborating to understand and expose the corrupt system that rules us. The system thrives on deception, and the overwhelming task of The Great Awakening is to penetrate its lies and reveal the truth. The first phase of The Great Awakening is heightened awareness of the Deep State  the interlocking governmental entities that operate outside the law to expand their own power. Elections and popular opinion dont impact the ability of the Deep State to enforce its agenda. The second phase of The Great Awakening investigates the Deep States alliance with other powerful sectors: the media, Hollywood, charities and non-profits, public schools and universities, religious organizations, medical, scientific and financial institutions, and multinational corporations. This phase can be painful, as you discover that **those you trust the most** (in Qs phrase) are deceiving you. Beloved celebrities, religious leaders, doctors, educators, innovators, and do-gooders are all in on the hoax. The third phase of The Great Awakening is perhaps the most painful of all. The people who rule us are not merely amoral creatures who view us as collateral damage in their drive for money and power. Its scarier than that. The potentates we serve are actively trying to harm us. Thats their goal. Were under coordinated attack. **Dark To Light:** Q tells us that what our rulers fear the most is exposure. Bringing their crimes out of protected darkness into the light of public scrutiny destroys their power to deceive. And as their power fades, the darkness of our divided, violent world will yield to the light of freedom, cooperation, and peace. ** Where We Go One We Go All (WWG1WGA):** Qs most famous phrase expresses the worldwide egalitarian nature of the movement. Every country is suffering from the systems oppression, and the whole world will benefit from a rebirth of freedom. In this unique movement, anonymous citizens work in collaboration with the highest-ranking military leaders and the president, and everyones contributions are valued. When commenters on the board have thanked Q for his service, Q has replied that no one is above and no one is below. We work for you. **These people are sick.** Perhaps the most difficult aspect of The Great Awakening is coming to terms with the depravity of our rulers, whom Q has called The Cult. Jeffrey Epsteins story has helped to awaken people to some of the elites crimes. The mysterious temple on Epsteins island hints at possible future revelations that are frightening in their scope. Q followers believe that The Cult engages in ritual practices that enshrine the shedding of blood and which prey on the innocence of children. The sickness in their souls thrives on brutality, war, and terror. These disclosures will be tough for the public to take. **Trust the plan.** The presumed military leaders who created Q and who protected Trump throughout the election and presidency have created a precise path to victory. Despite the seeming chaos of daily events, a steady progression of victories is taking place. The plan includes offensive maneuvers against the Cults financial power, legal standing, human supply chains, and military capacity. And, of crucial importance, the plan attacks the Cults ability to control the narrative that shapes what the public believes. In this high-stakes game of information warfare, Q plays a vital role by empowering ordinary citizens (like me) to spread the truth. **They want you divided.** The hatred thats growing between races, classes, age groups, religions, and political parties is purposely fomented by the Cult. The more were divided and focused on attacking each other, the weaker we become. Q urges us to stay together and to fight the Cult, not each other. **They think youre sheep.** The Cult believes, as Q says, youll follow the stars  the celebrities in media, Hollywood, and academia who tell you, in coordinated fashion, what youre supposed to think. Their contempt for you makes them confident they can control you and ensure your surrender to any agenda. Q, on the other hand, offers only clues and can only be understood by high-grade critical thinking, spurred by constant crowd-sourced criticism and reassessment. The essence of the Q movement is to think for yourself. **Bigger than you can imagine. Expand your thinking.** Q encourages us to reevaluate everything we think we know. The Cult may date back to ancient times, and through its powerful families, it might have manipulated historical events in ways that we havent suspected. The Cult may also possess advanced technology and medical cures that have not been released to the public. One aspect that may be bigger than you can imagine is the unfathomable scale of theft from our national coffers, as funds for foreign aid and wars wind up in the Cults pockets. **Track resignations.** Beneath the surface, a broad and deep cleansing of corrupt players is taking place. Q asked us to track resignations to understand the scope of activity. (Heres a [website](URL that took him up on his request) Resignations, retirements, and unexpected deaths from major players in politics, media, charities, and corporations all point to possible deals being made quietly without the public fanfare of arrests. For me, a notable resignation is Eric Schmidts abrupt exit from Google, which received little media attention. Schmidt resigned on December 21st, 2017, the same day that President Trump signed an executive order declaring a national emergency related to serious human rights abuse and corruption around the world. Further context for Schmidts resignation may be inferred from this photo of him in North Korea, apparently in an advisory role. Standing next to him is Bill Richardson, former Governor of New Mexico, the state in which Epstein had a secret ranch. Richardson has been accused by one of Epsteins victims. **Their need for symbols will be their downfall.** The Cult uses certain symbols over and over again, which may serve some ritualistic need, but makes them vulnerable to detection. Q followers are familiar with Y-shaped horns that mimic those of the goat deity Baphomet, owls, pyramids, one eye encased within a pyramid, red shoes, bandaged fingers, and other repeating symbols, including the mysterious black eye that afflicts so many famous people. The Q Army also knows the coded pedophile symbols listed by the FBI. When Q drew attention to the design of Epsteins temple, alert Q followers noticed how similar it is to the set design of a famous talk show. And the red ring on the hand of dead terrorist Qassam Soleimani prompted Q followers to compile images of similar rings on the hands of powerful people. An excellent source for understanding how these symbols are incorporated into pop culture targeting the young through music videos, TV shows and movies can be found at [vigilantcitizen.com](URL **Nothing can stop what is coming. Nothing. Now comes the pain.** The headlines on any given day may sound discouraging for those who want justice to prevail. But these setbacks are temporary, as a juggernaut of justice heads our way. As Q likes to say: **We have it all.** Massive amounts of irrefutable evidence await the criminals who try to evade their reckoning in court. For those who worry about Trumps ability to overcome impeachment, election fraud, and assassination attempts, Q assures us: **Patriots in control.** And no legal tricks can help the criminals escape the ultimate judgment of public disgust. Q promises us that **the day is coming when they cant walk down the street.** **You are the news now.** The fake news decried by President Trump is losing credibility and audience by the day. Q has exposed the 4 A.M. drops that provide the daily talking points to media personnel, so they can all parrot the same propaganda. Q has also named various journalists whom he says take bribes. The media is concentrated within six powerful companies; on the other hand, the Q army is vast, voluntary, and anonymous. Q assures us that our efforts to disseminate the truth through social media and conversations with family and friends are having a huge impact. We are the news now. We know what happens in the end. **God wins.** Many times, Q has asked us to pray. Hes quoted the famous Biblical lines of Ephesians 6:12, For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Were living through monumental times. Its comforting that Q believes that if we work together, God wins. [More Intro to Q](URL"
4,cyber-crime,conspiracy,Q Proof: V. COVFEFE,1,erpbiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/erpbiq/q_proof_v_covfefe/,2020-01-21 15:16:12,"The largest recorded protest WITH guns and NO SHOTS FIRED OCCURED TODAY QANON2020 TRUMP2020 An Introduction to Q Who is Q? What is Q? And, perhaps most importantly, why is Q? Q and the ever-growing worldwide movement its inspired have been the objects of fascination, mockery and hatred, but of surprisingly little serious analysis. Q first appeared in October 2017 on an anonymous online forum called 4Chan, posting messages that implied top-clearance knowledge of upcoming events. More than 3,000 messages later, Q has created a disturbing, multi-faceted portrait of a global crime syndicate that operates with impunity. Qs followers in the QAnon community faithfully analyze every detail of Qs drops, which are compiled here and here. The mainstream media has published hundreds of articles attacking Q as an insane rightwing conspiracy, particularly after President Trump seemed to publicly confirm his connection to it. At a North Carolina rally in 2019, Trump made a point of drawing attention to a baby wearing a onesie with a big Q. In recent weeks, the tempo of Trumps spotlighting of Q has accelerated, with the President retweeting Q followers twenty times in one day. Trump has featured Q fans in his ads and deployed one of Qs signature phrases (These people are sick) at his rallies. The Presidents lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has also retweeted Q followers. Q has noted that the media never asks Trump the obvious question: What do you think of Q? To Q followers, the reason they dont ask is obvious. Theyre afraid of the answer. In the meantime, Qs influence continues to spread. Protestors in Hong Kong, Iran, and France have held up Q signs and chanted Q quotes. Qs revelations are uniting people all over the world who want freedom. If youre unfamiliar with Q or only know it through the medias attacks, Id like to provide a brief introduction to this extraordinary phenomenon. Ive followed Q since the first drop, and Ive grown increasingly impressed by the accuracy, breadth and depth of Qs messages. Q followers were prepared long in advance for the easing of hostilities with North Korea, the deflation of the mullahs of Iran, and the discovery of Ukraine as a hotbed of corruption for American politicians. They knew a great deal about Jeffrey Epsteins activities before the public did and anticipate even more shocking revelations to come. As Q likes to say, Future proves past. As Qs predictions come true, they lend retroactive credibility to the entire enterprise. Qs followers believe that Q is a military intelligence operation, the first of its kind, whose goal is to provide the public with secret information. Many Q followers think the Q team was founded by Admiral Michael Rogers, the former Director of the National Security Agency and former Commander of US Cyber Command. Some suspect that Dan Scavino, White House Director of Social Media, is part of the team, because the high quality of Qs writing has the luster of a communications expert. Q is a new weapon in the game of information warfare, bypassing a hostile media and corrupt government to communicate directly with the public. Think of Q as a companion to Trumps twitter. Whereas Trump communicates bluntly and directly, Q is cryptic, sly and subtle, offering only clues that beg for context and connection. Heres the way it works: Q posts messages (also known as drops or crumbs) on an anonymous online forum, which are discussed, analyzed, and critiqued by the boards inhabitants. (The forum has changed a few times after massive online attacks.) Hundreds of social media accounts then spread Qs latest posting to worldwide followers who share their research, analysis, and interpretations of Qs latest information. Ive compiled a list of Qs most famous catch phrases and tried to put them into context. The Great Awakening: Were living in a unique time in which ordinary citizens around the world are collaborating to understand and expose the corrupt system that rules us. The system thrives on deception, and the overwhelming task of The Great Awakening is to penetrate its lies and reveal the truth. The first phase of The Great Awakening is heightened awareness of the Deep State  the interlocking governmental entities that operate outside the law to expand their own power. Elections and popular opinion dont impact the ability of the Deep State to enforce its agenda. The second phase of The Great Awakening investigates the Deep States alliance with other powerful sectors: the media, Hollywood, charities and non-profits, public schools and universities, religious organizations, medical, scientific and financial institutions, and multinational corporations. This phase can be painful, as you discover that those you trust the most (in Qs phrase) are deceiving you. Beloved celebrities, religious leaders, doctors, educators, innovators, and do-gooders are all in on the hoax. The third phase of The Great Awakening is perhaps the most painful of all.

Chen Qiushi is reporting from inside China &amp; I think his videos seem to be the most investigative and informative. This is his newest video on the subject. I have included translation from YouTube. URL Full Complete English Translation : [ 0:00 - 0:45 ] Today is 2/Feb/2020. I know that I am not a professional journalist, that disappointed many people who supported me, for not exposing some explosive news that people expected to see. Many had given advice leading me to stakeout undercover infront of funeral parlor (Han Kou Parlor) to check for the death statistics. I had actually went and tried. [ 0:45 - 1:10 ] Behind me is ""Han Kou Funeral Parlor"", currently 29/January/2020, time at 9:30p.m, we are planning to wait for 3 hours to see how many corpse transportation would enter and exit the parlor. [ 1:11 - 1:12 ] In the past 1.5 hours of staking out, there were 4 vans entered the parlor. [ 1:13 - 1:45 ] Tonight is 31/January/2020, time at 8:00 p.m, in front of a hospital, let us stake out to see how many corpse transportation and ambulances. At 8:30p.m, both storeys of the hospital are all lit up, could possibly be understood as fully occupied by patients. I heard a volunteer at the hospital claimed that there are 600 positively diagnosed patients in the hospital, all from 7 different hospitals, with 3,000 beds being mostly occupied by other patients ( possibly including suspecting patients awaiting for further diagnosis ) [ 1:46 - 2:30 ] Same day ( 31/Jan ), time at 9:04 p.m, we arrived at the same Han Kou funeral parlor to investigate about the corpse transportations. Time at 10:00 p.m, over the past 1 hour, we had seen 4 vehicles arrived at the parlor, this time it is different from last time ( 29 / Jan ) where different type of vehicles had surfaced, including 1 funeral van, 1 white van, and 1 SUV entered the parlor. I am not so sure if all these vehicles are temporarily added to aid in transportation of corpses. [ 2:30 - 3:10 ] I had staked out to investigate the corpse transportation at the funeral parlor two nights. first day at 29/Jan, the next at 31/Jan. The 2nd time is not so fruitful, but the 1st visit has 4 funeral vehicles entered and exited the parlor in 1.5 hours. The funeral by the time was working 24 hours in cycle, a simple math which is 1.5 hours per 4 vehicles, then viewers could try to imagine how many transportations per day. (** I DO MATH FOR YOU : 24 / 1.5 * 4 = 64 vehicles per day **) HOWEVER, how many corpses in every vehicle is not confirmable. BUT, according to another video investigation from Wuhan local private journalist yesterday ( 1/Feb/2020 ), he video recorded that there were 8 corpses in a van ready to be transported. THIS HOWEVER, is also another ""indirect evidence"". [ 3:11 - 3:30 ] As a local chinese from mainland china, without concrete evidences, I am NOT allowed to have any doubt against the statement and statistics from the government party. We lawyers and journalists are equivalent, we base truth on facts and evidences, we don't lie and manipulate evidences. Hence, I provide lots of, scattered evidences and facts infront of the viewers, to help you to resolve the puzzles. [ 3:31 - 3:45 ] Actually, the video footage about the stake out at the funeral parlor is not meant to be disclosed at this early stage. Because I wish to be more like a professional undercover journalist to gather more evidences before exposing the truth. I will explain 2 reasons of the exposure urgency : [ 3:45 - 4:03 ] (1) Before 31/Jan/2020, there is only one operating funeral parlor ( Han Kou Parlor ) in carrying out the duty of cremating the corpses who died of Corona Virus. However, after 31/Jan, there are more funeral parlors are assigned to cremate the corpses of corona virus. It hence became meaningless to stake out further just solely infront of Han Kou Parlor. [ 4:03 - 5:12 ] (2) Next, regarding the local private investigator ( a local wuhan citizen named 'Fang Bing' ), his encounter of police who camouflaged as CDC members ( chinese disease control center ), who came at night and ambushed, later broke into his house for the reason of video footage about corpse and opinions about the facts in hospital in the early morning the same day. Fang Bing was very cautious, he took a video about the police trying to break into his house, and quickly sent to the social media. Friends and other families quickly spread the video around the net (including Twitter, Youtube ), which eventually helped to pressure the government into releasing him from the police station. He stayed up to 12 a.m in the midnight in the police station, however the attitude of police and national security officers had calmed later and only given a verbal warning about not spreading about the ""Negative side"" of the video footage about the corona virus, also telling him he had no ""Rights"" to comment about the news of virus, only the government has the rights to tell the truth. He later spent 3 hours riding an O-Bike back to his home from police station, later arrived home at around 5 a.m, and immediately without any sleep, recorded a video about his safety and encounter to his friends and family. [ 5:13 - 5:38 ] A single individual, without any wrong doings or odds against the law, but only reporting about the genuine facts of the happening, could be caught by police who camouflaged as CDC members ( Chinese Disease Control ), and forcefully detained in the name of 'Virus Quarantine'. Imagine if there is no public opinions and awareness in the social media about his incident, no one knows if he could be taken away for good and never return. There is even a public announcement which says : ""If you had closely be in contact with any infected patient, the government has absolute right to detain you for quarantine by force."" [ 5:39 - 5:55 ] Mr. Fang Bing is still very nervous about the encounter ( likely to happen again ), and hence he appealed to the public and citizens in Wuhan to be : ""Self aware, self awakening, self help, and help each other"" in such a case and moment, otherwise you might be forcefully quarantined by the government. He told us he's healthy today, and he is constantly checking his body temperature to ensure safety. [ 5:55 - 6:15 ] These are the reasons rushed me into exposing the video about the funeral stake out, sincerely apologize for not being able to demonstrate shocking truth with only so little evidences. I am not sure if I could also be taken away by the government police like Mr. Fang Bing, it could be any time, without any valid reason. [ 6:15 - 6:30 ] I know a lot of people are questioning about my identity, why is Mr. Fang Bing getting arrested, but NOT YOU, Chen Qiu Shi (Author)? Yeah? How am I supposed to answer those questions? Why are you guys expecting me to be arrested so desperately?? Did I offend any law in China? And what is your intention in me to be arrested by the government? [ 6:30 - 7:04 ] Why are you guys so reluctant in admitting that .. (1) I am just merely in good luck. (2) Lots of friends and people are helping me, covering up for me. (3) Can't you agree that I am also intelligent and deceitful. There are so many escapists in crime, and never get arrested for decades, so are you concluding they are all spies from government? I am lazy to deal with your assertive accusations, we could talk about my identity later in future, not now! However, Mr. Fang Bing's incident had showed us that every citizen in Wuhan, should voice up to the world and let them know about the truth in Wuhan : ""Self aware, self awakening, self help, and help each other"" to achieve such an action. And only through these, the world could raise a helping hand to you for safety. [ 7:05 - 7:45 ] Recalled there is a patient that I accompanied to ""Tong Ji Hospital"", who did not manage to get a vacancy for the bed? He'd also written down his experience and sent over to the social media to ask for help. However, in the following 2 days, the cyber security OR cyber monitoring department from the government, had rung to his phone and investigated about his situation. This is the influence of public opinions and voices in the social media, which pressured the government into action. The government officers though did not manage to provide him any treatment vacancy, and continued to talk him into calmness. This however has proven that, If only you could brave up and voice up your opinion and needs to the public, you could atleast have a slightest chance. However, if you did not try anything, and always only hoping somebody else could be the hero to come for rescue, the ONLY OUTCOME is even after your death, YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED in the statistics of death from corona virus. (Meaning, you are just annonymously burnt into ashes in cremation without being recorded in stats ) [ 7:45 - 7:57 ] I repeat, ""Self aware, self awakening, self help, help each other"" is the most important thing for people in Wuhan to do, to let the world hear us and help us. [ 7:57 - 8:30 ] FOOTAGE of Mr.Fang Bing on 1/Feb/2020, before he was arrested on the same night. They do not allow me to visit the patient's room. This is Wuchan's Funeral vehicle which I showed you earlier, the corpse number had increased. Earlier it was 3 corpses, let me recount. 1, 2, 3, 4, ... 8, There are 8 corpses... *Sigh ... * So many people died, are these people from yesterday? ""Yes"" Too many deaths! [ 8:30 - 8:40 ] * A man in black cried over the phone, his dad had passed away from corona virus infection. * ""Not gonna make it ... "" ( talked over phone ) [ 8:41 - 8:53 ] Who is lying here? ""Father ..! "" (Sobbing) ""He's my father .. "" [ 8:54 - 9:06 ] Mr. Fang Bing : Oh god ... hes' done ... there is no sign of life.. It is over ... it's over ... ! Oh no .. one more life is t"

In the presence of polite company, I shall not repeat them but rest assured, the routine is still hilarious to this day. I wish I could say the same about the Department of Homeland Security I wish I could say this is all a big joke that the governments 377 words you can never use online is just some stupid comedy routine. But its not. And you just cant make this stuff. After vigorous resistance, the Department of Homeland Security was finally forced into releasing its 2011 Analysts Desktop Binder. Its a manual of sorts, teaching all the storm troopers who monitor our Internet activity all day which key words to look for. Facebook, a.k.a. the US governments domestic intelligence center, is the primary target for this monitoring though its become clear so many times before that various departments, including the NSA and FBI, are monitoring online activity ranging from search terms to emails. Domestic spying is typically denied in public and swept under the rug. After all, its legality has always been questionable if not entirely Unconstitutional. Yet month after month it seems, there is new legislation introduced to deprive Internet users of their privacy and make the open collection of data a natural part of the online landscape. Homeland Securitys key word hotlist is really no surprise theyre just the ones to get caught. So now we know, at least, what these goons are looking for. Sort of. According to the manual, DHS breaks down its monitoring into a whopping 14 categories ranging from Health to Fire to Terrorism. Its a testament to how bloated the departments scope has become. Afterwards there is a list of 377 of key terms to monitor, most of which are completely innocuous. Exercise. Cloud. Leak. Sick. Organization. Pork. Bridge. Smart. Tucson. Target. China. Social media. Curiously, in its Critical Information Requirements, the manual decrees that analysts should also catalog items which may reflect adversely on DHS and response activities. Absolutely unreal. Big Brother is not just watching. Hes digging, searching, reading, monitoring, archiving, and judging too.

His briefcase went missing from the wreckage. This was the first of many deaths of people attempting to uncover this politically connected satanic cult/sex slave/drug trafficking ring. The Discovery Channel made a documentary about this case, entitled Conspiracy of Silence, but at the last moment, a group of unidentified US Congressmen paid them $500,000 to not air it, and all copies were destroyed (one copy survived). Republican senator John DeCamp, who was on the investigative committee, wrote a book exposing the case, titled, The Franklin Cover-Up. In 1999 (see below), Paul Bonacci, who had been kept as a child sex slave by Lawrence King, positively identified Lt. Col. Michael Aquino as an associate of King, who he said was known to the children only as the Colonel. Rusty Nelson, Kings personal photographer, also identified Aquino as the man that he once saw King give a briefcase full of money and bearer bonds to, and who King had told him was involved in the Contra gun and cocaine trafficking operation being run by George Bush Sr. and Lt.

Aquino was publicly complaining that she was causing serious problems for him and his fellow pedophiles. Nonetheless, the article at the first link below clearly reveals the one-sided reporting on this story by the San Diego Union Tribune and the fact that if anyone was being cyber-stalked, it was Napolis.

Michael Aquino to the nationwide pedophile ring. She stated: Well, then there was a man by the name of Michael Aquino. He was in the military. He had top Pentagon clearances. He was a pedophile. He was a Satanist. He's founded the Temple of Set. And he was a close friend of Anton LaVey. The two of them were very active in ritualistic sexual abuse. And they deferred funding from this government program to use \[in\] this experimentation on children. Where they deliberately split off the personalities of these children into multiples, so that when they're questioned or put under oath or questioned under lie detector, that unless the operator knows how to question a multiple-personality disorder, they turn up with no evidence. They used these kids to sexually compromise politicians or anyone else they wish to have control of. This sounds so far out and so bizarre I had trouble accepting it in the beginning myself until I was presented with the data. We have the proof. In black and white."" Paul Bonacci, who was a victim of this nationwide pedophile crime syndicate, subsequently identified Aquino as the man who ordered the kidnapping of Johnny Gosch. Three weeks after the hearing, on February 27, Judge Warren K. Urbom ordered Lawrence King to pay $1 million in damages to Bonacci."

This is a concept everyone here MUST understand.",59,dofo4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/dofo4p/manufactured_problem_reaction_solution_this_is_a/,2019-10-29 08:24:26,"This simplified version of the \[Hegelian Dialectic\]([URL is a tactic powerful people use to manipulate their citizenry. Democracy offers the illusion of freedom but it's actually just a small hurdle for the elites to jump over to obtain what they want. A despotic ruler can do whatever they want, while a democratic leader must manufacture the consent of the public in order to do what they want. As in, make the public believe that what the elites want is actually in their own best interest. There is a perpetual power struggle between governments and their citizens. Governments always want more control, and any power the people cede to the government can never be won back without bloodshed. Rights like those outlined in the constitution (free speech, right to privacy, bear arms and a fair trial, etc.) are a huge obstacle to governments having total control over their citizens' lives. We need only look at despotic rulers of recent history (Stalin, Mao, Hitler, Marcos, Pol Pot, etc.) to see that those very rights are some of the first things to go on the road to total government control. But how can western democratic leaders convince people to give up their own rights? How can they keep tabs on everyone and implement police states to lay the groundwork for omnipresent control, when people are generally happy and things are going well? The tried and true formula is Manufactured Problem --&gt; Reaction --&gt; ""Solution."" Here are some examples: Relocate millions of people from Africa and the Middle East to Europe --&gt; Violent crime increases, social cohesion and trust decreases, anti-Muslim sentiment increases --&gt; Increase police presence and introduce facial recognition technology, erode ability to speak freely by prosecuting people for ""hate speech"" on the internet Talk about school shootings in the media nonstop (and possibly instigate shootings) --&gt; More shootings happen because shooters want to be immortalized by the media, people become scared of guns --&gt; Increase police presence in schools, erode the 2nd amendment by increasing gun control measures 9/11 ""terrorist"" attacks --&gt; People are scared of terrorism, people are angry and want revenge --&gt; Introduce TSA to airports, invade Afghanistan, erode the 4th amendment by implementing the Patriot Act Media pushes narrative of rampant ""cyber bullying,"" and ""radicalization"" on the internet --&gt; Parents are scared the internet is going to negatively affect their kids --&gt; Erode the 1st amendment by increasing censorship, slowly start to scrub the internet of information that is contrary to the MSM narrative under the guise of ""cracking down on trolls"" Media claims Russia is controlling our elections with ""fake news"" --&gt; Red Scare 2.0, people accusing each other of being ""Russian trolls"" online, confusion and demoralization --&gt; Increase internet censorship, manipulate algorithms, introduce Ministry of Truth-esque blurbs under headlines by the MSM to regain control of the narrative There are a million more examples of this tactic in action that I'm sure you can come up with. They all work together to keep us in a constant state of fear and make us beg for our freedoms to be taken away in return for the illusion of safety. This simple tactic is a major mechanism of the eternal conspiracy: the conspiracy of the elites to manipulate and control the common people. With modern technology (facial recognition, data collection, Facebook, Alexa, NSA, etc.) elites are closer to realizing the kind of complete control that despots throughout history could have only dreamed of."

Now before I answer this question, I would like to breakdown the question first because this question here is special, after all the usual people that is being asked this question and who is told to answer it are in typically school and because of this they turned a completely honest question that in theory is supposed to build up young minds in social interaction instead that question is stealthy being used to judged the kids mental frame work on how they see the future of America that is to come. In short conclusion this here is the growing problem in America. Now believe it or not, what is supposed to be an honest question for all people to answer and share their opinion has been tuned on its head because potentially to answer this question could potentially turn into federal criminal investigation, or in big brother speak a ""Thought Crime."" So reader be careful in answering the Question about What america will look like in fifty years in the future because if you give the wrong answer as to what you think the future would look like you will be taught a lesson until your answer is the same as everyone, So do you wanna be taught a lesson or do you wanna be smart the choice is yours kid. The Words Smiths in higher education have a plan that I like to explain as the Educated Lie which is the idea that everyone will divide themselves down into smaller groups and those groups would eventually divide themselves down into more smaller groups for the whole purpose to indoctrinate certain people who went down the yellow brick road with their so called cultural beliefs... Now here is the deal that makes this the ultimate technological Utopian society that is always preached about which is that everyone one of these groups all have only one thing in common that completes the circle which is Anarchy. Some groups see anarchy as total freedom, while other groups see it as total control, and even though these are Two groups speak about anarchy with their own different words and thoughts its still the same idea its just different way of saying it... Left wing and Right wing Anarchy is modern day American Politics. America is way past socialism today and that says a lot for what America will look like in fifty years. Now to answer my question ""What will America look like in fifty years?"" how about you go ask the Big Tech Companies after your finished reading my post... I believe that America's future is divided and not everyone's hopes and dreams are going to come true because the America's Future has been sold to the big tech companies. The future of economics in America is with Big Tech. The Industrialization of American Civilization paved the roads to Western Civilization downfall with the rise of the digital high-way of thinking that dispenses this digital technology all around the world because in the digital world it going to make a world a better place for everyone... Its all machines today and those machine will be there in the future but even better or worse. Fifty years from now there will be people fused with the Machine because that stuff is being developed today on the level that is suitable for economic growth and ripe ready for experimentation. Artificial Economic Viably will be the currency of the future much like how diversity is now the social currency of today. This is what they always intended to be the foundation to build the next launchpad for civilization to manifest into. America is the modern day equivalent to the Tower Of Bable, and as the story goes once the people start speaking different languages they no longer could communicate and work together to build the Tower and the tower come crumbling down, or in this instance the ""machine"" because once the machine is built much like how the atomic bomb was built to win WW2 the power that this new weapon has will be viewed as the winning solution that wins WW3. No need to be Smart anymore let the machine make your life easier and do all the thinking for you because fifty years in the future people will die from being with out electricity exactly like how people die from dehydration that how connected people will be with the machine by then, some will even need an oil change. I called this post the Project for a New American Civil War to describe the hidden agenda that is going on with in Big Tech corporations in how they essentially view a portion of their Users as Thought Criminals. The Big Tech Corporations see the Truth is getting out, and see how people are noticing along with how they are being forced feed a narrative that somehow your brainwashed because you understand an opposing idea to question their insanity. Hate to burst your bubble man, but we don't live around simple machines anymore, technology has become complex more then ever and today these groups protect it by projecting a civil war on the general public to hide the fact that the beginnings of an Authoritarian technological take over in America is happening. Its an invisible war between those who want control over this new age Cyber Electric Machine."

The Police are not here to ""protect and serve"" at all. They actually have absoultey no obligation to protect anyone at all--as the Jesuit educated/Catholic lawyers who dominate the U.S. Supreme Court have ruled! : [URL Police in the United States were created primarily to manage slaves in the south, and break up strikes and labor protesters--to protect the private property of the financial elite and Rome . Peter J Doeswyck in his book *Catholic Victory in 1960,* speaks on how Rome uses the Police for its own ends. "" Getting back to the dictatorship of fear and reprisal of the old democratic bosses, the first thing it imposed on a city was a Roman Catholic police force. This police force controlled and still controls the Catholic underworld and collects from it mil lions of dollars to perpetuate itself in office. **It is not a coincidence that in Chicago, a city of prostitutes, bookmakers and gangsters, the Catholic bishop receives car license plate no. 1 to indicate that he is the first citizen of that city.** Underworld slayings, though often forecast by our newspapers, are never solved by such police departments. Illegal gambling is exhibited publicly in the streets. **Sometimes the Catholic police and the Catholic underworld clash when the first tries to extort too much money from the latter.** Three hundred of the citys biggest bookies, reported the New York papers, shut down their telephone services and went on strike against the exorbitant shakedowns by police officials (N. Y. Daily News, Feb. 7, 1947). **Statistics show that in that year (1947) New York City was 79% non Catholic, but its police force was 62.8% Catholic, while the higher-ups in that department were 80% Catholic. Once it is in control of a city, this gangster element makes the Catholic bishop its first citizen.** It is an ordinary thing in New York to find 100 policemen at the steps of St. Patricks during a society wedding or funeral, while not a single one at the door of Rockefeller Center. The cathedral holds 2,000 people, the center 70,000. Not only cities, **but Protestant towns and counties often have Roman Catholic chiefs and sheriffs.** In places where mayors are elected and the chief of police appointed, the Romanists usually make a deal with the Protestant candidates and promise the Catholic vote if one of their men will be appointed as chief. In certain fields the chief of police has more power than a mayor and even more power than the President of the United States. It is a fact that every citizen and newspaper dares to attack the policies of the President and call him names, but no local citizen or local paper dares to attack the chief of police, unless City Hall and the papers and the public attempt to oust the chief in a united drive. **Because of their power, these Catholic chiefs can perpetuate themselves in office and make a farce out of democracy.** Like the bishops, who maintain a file of all scandals of their priests in order to keep them under subjection, most of our police departments in our bigger cities maintain files of men who have no police records but are potential, political opponents. **Like the Jesuits, who own the state-controlled houses of prostitution in Spain and secretly register their patrons, many of our police departments have and are still controlling our houses of prostitution and gambling establishments**, and are using hundreds of detectives to trail political opponents. Wiretapping and bugging are the order of the day. Private detectives, invariably ex police officers or bad Catholics, have access, direct or indirect, to all police files and can blackmail almost any citizen.

Lets take a look at the Ukraine, which as you all know the Crimean Peninsula has been annexed by Russia in 2014. Since then, the Ukraine has been subject to cyber crime, power grid hacks, and online propaganda. In 2015 the Ukrainian power grid was hacked, most likely by the Russians. This caused millions of dollars in damage as the heated pipes froze beneath city causing extensive infrastructure damage and no doubt killed a couple people due to exposure in the Ukrainian winter. URL URL URL On top of the blatant hacking, the Ukraine was one of the first countries to have an outbreak of Measles: URL URL URL Coincidence? I think not. Spreading disinformation about vaccines is an excellent way to bring diseases into a country without actually doing anything direct, like chemical or biological weapons.

29,cyber-crime,conspiracy,How hacktivism intersects with the law - I think a lot of people consider the Aaron Swartz prosecution to be a massive example of prosecutorial overreach.,43,9a2zyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9a2zyh/how_hacktivism_intersects_with_the_law_i_think_a/,2018-08-25 11:15:58,"URL Article talks about Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Mentions include Aaron Swartz and JSTOR, weev and At&amp;T, Anonymous and Op Chanology &gt;Were taking a deeper look at the idea of hacktivism, and how activists use technology to push forward a social or political agenda. To try and understand the laws around hacking and the future of hacktivism, Marketplace Tech host Ben Johnson talked to Molly Sauter, a doctoral researcher and author of the book, ""The Coming Swarm: DDoS Actions, Hacktivism, and Civil Disobedience on the Internet."" Below is an edited transcript of their conversation. &gt;Ben Johnson: So can you briefly explain some of the laws governing cyber crime in the U.S. right now? &gt;Molly Sauter: So there really is just one. It's called the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and is the major piece of anti-hacking legislation in the U.S. and what it is at core is a fraud statute. And this has a couple implications. One, it's both a criminal and a civil law so you can be prosecuted as a criminal under this law but you can also have a civil action brought against you under this law and because it's a fraud statute, it has certain implications for how jail time and fines and restitution payments are constructed. And how these are constructed is fairly complicated but essentially what it boils down to is if more people are impacted by your action, the worse your punishment is and the higher your fine is. Right. And as we know, on the internet audiences can scale very fast so the quote unquote like ""impacted victim group"" can be very high and there isn't really an established way of calculating what that number is or what the damages are that companies can claim. &gt;Johnson: Right. So like, it could be anyone who has ever seen a movie by Sony? &gt;Sauter: In theory, yes. So not only is the victim pool not readily calculateable, but also the law itself is very vaguely worded. It talks a lot about unauthorized access of, quote unquote ""protected computers,"" which was initially a term of art intended to refer to computers involved in banking or in government, but has been widely interpreted to include, like, really any computer. And unauthorized access has also been very widely interpreted. It could be that you were using somebody else's password with permission, but you didn't have the quote unquote permission of the service or the person who owned that computer. It could be that you didn't have password access because it didn't require password access, but someone just mistakenly put something online that maybe they didn't intend to put online. So the law itself, while vaguely worded in the beginning to sort of enable it to scale with the times means that there has been a huge amount of what I would consider prosecutorial overreach: trying to pursue people who have made the internet maybe not as safe for commerce as maybe the U.S. government would like it to be. &gt;Johnson: But it is interesting here that the law was basically designed to age well. &gt;Sauter: Yeah, so most of the time when you make a law about something that's rapidly changing like technology, you want to err on the side of being vague, because you want people to be able to adapt that law to the future. So it wasn't necessarily written badly  what it was was written vaguely, and now it is being implemented badly in many cases. &gt;Johnson: You've been listening to some of the previous stories that we have put in our series. If we look at some of the individuals featured, like this woman who founded Sci-Hub, legally how could she be punished under this law? &gt;Sauter: So we've actually already seen this as is noted in the interview. She's basically being pursued under the same theory of the law as Aaron Swartz was. &gt;Johnson: Right. &gt;Sauter: Essentially she is getting access to art and she's not doing it the same way necessarily that Aaron Swartz did  he used a small script and basically downloaded too many articles too fast. And JSTOR wasn't super thrilled about that. But she's being prosecuted under the same theory of the law that she's violating what are called the Terms of Service of these different websites and releasing their work, what they are claiming is their work product, in a way that violates how they would like people to be releasing it. &gt;Johnson: Are there clear examples of the kind of overreach that you're talking about of this law being sort of abused? &gt;Sauter: So that's a complicated question and has a lot to do with sort of how you interpret what computers are and what these different types of, quote unquote crimes are. I think a lot of people consider the Aaron Swartz prosecution to be a massive example of prosecutorial overreach. I think people have generally considered to be the weev prosecution to be a huge example of prosecutorial overreach that was later overturned. &gt;Johnson: Can you just describe that weev example for those who don't know it? &gt;Sauter: So the weev case was, there was a guy who goes on the internet by the name of ""weev."" Whose name is Andrew ""weev"" Aurenheimer. And he stumbled across  So AT&amp;T assigns an address to your iPad when you put your iPad on the network. Andrew discovered that this address was actually publicly accessible. If you typed in a certain URL into your web browser and then iterated a series of numbers on the end of that URL, you could find people's iPads on the public internet. You didn't need a password, you didn't need to be internal to AT&amp;T systems  you could just find them. And he sent them an email, is like, ""Hey, this is a thing that happened  you need to fix this because this is a massive security bug or I'm going to give it to Gawker."" They certainly didn't fix it. And he and his partner gave that information to Gawker, which wrote an article about it. And Andrew and his partner were arrested and criminally prosecuted for hacking. It was said that they had hacked into this system when these, when these objects, these technical objects were publicly available on the Internet through a mistake of the company. &gt;Johnson: You've written some pieces about what you think the future of hacktivism looks like. Can you paint that picture for us? &gt;Sauter: So I think there are a couple of directions that hacktivism is going to go into in the future. One of them is something I call alternate infrastructures. And we can see that right now actually if you've heard the chatter around Mastodon as a federated alternative to Twitter. Now there have been other federated alternatives to major social networking sites that have been introduced in the past that haven't really taken off. You might remember Diaspora, which was supposed to be the federated Facebook for a hot minute. &gt;So people often come up with these alternative systems. What's interesting about Mastodon and other of these so-called federated examples, is that they enable people to host individual instances of the code on their own servers. So they control their own servers. They tend to have a very strong emphasis on you controlling your data and then because it's federated, it means you can see what's happening on all the other servers as well as what's going on on your server. So you're not just stuck in your own little, like IRC channel with just your people. You can also see what's going on in the rest of the network. And alternative infrastructure like this is a really powerful way to remove yourself from the net economy that is powered by advertising, data scraping and data analysis which is getting more and more creepy, especially as it becomes sort of a technological tactic that's being picked up by political campaigns. &gt;Johnson: This is fascinating. It's like this idea of privacy protection through total transparency or something. &gt;Sauter: Yes, so the idea of transparency is really core to what I would consider to be sort of the history of activist technology. And we can go back and see this in the free software and open source movements, which were fundamentally about having your source code available and being able to share it and have lots of people look at it. Now this was sort of counterintuitive because you think, ""Well if everyone can look at my source code, you know they're going to steal it or they're going to find the bugs in it and then exploit them."" But what ends up happening is as you have more eyes looking at your code, you do have more people who can see the bugs, but you also have more people who can fix your bugs. And you also have more ways to innovate on that code so you can fork the code and someone else can say, ""Well you made a really cool piece of code for like making coffee. I made a fork that's about making lattes, and now you have both coffee and lattes together."" So this concept of open source like really promotes both innovation and safety. &gt;Johnson: What's another example of the future of hacktivism? &gt;Sauter: So another thing that is going to become, I think, very popular is something I'm calling information exfiltration. And this is slightly different than leaking and it's slightly different than like hacking for information. It's an over-concept. So you have both internal leakers  so people on the inside who are leaking information to the outside  but then you have people on the outside who want information that's inside a company or inside an individual's e-mail, so they'll hack into that database and remove that information and publish it. There's not only going to be more information online but because there's more information online it's actually far more accessible even if it's encrypted, because strong security is very hard. And as we've seen with the weev case, people make mistakes. Like we've also seen this with the Panama Papers case. As I can tell, the server that those emails were on for the Panama Papers case was wildly out of date. And so someone was able to access it because someone on the inside of that company failed to maintain their own security. &gt;Sauter: So as more things get moved online, those things become more vulnerable. And as different organizations who might be vulnerable to people wanting to know what's going on in them, like tax accountants who specialize in offshore accounts, or lawyers who specialize in international business or international taxation or international real estate, they're going to fail because it's inevitable, it's inevitable for that security to fail. So that information will be pulled and targeted and then put online. &gt;Johnson: Do you think that hacktivism in the digital world will ever replace activism in the physical world? &gt;Sauter: I don't think so. I think it will become more intuitive. So right now it's not super intuitive to the vast majority of the population that if you want to protest something you go online to do it. What's intuitive to them is petitions, street marches, sort of, media campaigns right now that involved like hashtags and those things feel much more intuitive than say joining a distributed denial of service action, which is a way of doing mass activism online. That started in the 90s and has become more popular since then, mostly through the actions of Anonymous. So Anonymous is the sort of internet collective that involves a large and ever-changing group of people who loosely share a politics and loosely share an aesthetic sense. And they've been engaged in a number of different actions that have included both online actions that are DDOS actions, information exfiltration and social media campaigns, but have also involved sort of real life street actions. So there were street marches against the Church of Scientology during Op Chanology. But that also included online actions. So you're not just going to  I don't think you're going to see a sole push to be online. &gt;I think what you're going to see is more people doing stuff online because that's where they're used to taking action. So especially people, sort of, of the millennial generation and up seeing this as a natural place for politics to occur. But you'll also see people engaged in street marches and you'll also see people engaged in what are more broadly considered mainstream politics. So I think more people are getting interested in running for office since the last presidential election. More people are interested in knowing how their government works. So you're going to see panoply of tactics that are coming forward and the internet's just going to be part of it."

Russias guilt is such an article of faith among our political class, that a Republican-controlled Congress imposed [sanctions](URL and President Trump signed on, substantially worsening relations with an important and potentially dangerous nation. &gt;Outside the Acela Corridor, however, one finds more skepticism. &gt;A lot of ordinary folks wonder why the DNC wouldnt let any outside parties examine their server. Instead, the FBI accepted the word of CrowdStrike, a private contractor hired by the DNC, without any independent confirmation. &gt;And a bunch of not so ordinary folks who know a thing or two about computers thinks there may be a simple explanation for the DNCs unwillingness to let outsiders have a peek at the evidence: There isnt any. The Russian hacking thats caused so much division and turmoil at home and abroad never really happened. It was all a ruse concocted by CrowdStrike. &gt;One such skeptic is an anonymous [journalist](URL and computer aficionado who goes by the pseudonym Adam Carter. Carter has spent the last couple of years cataloging [evidence](URL unearthed by himself and others, that CrowdStrike engaged in a disinformation campaign, inventing not just a fake Russian hack but also a fake hacker called Guccifer 2.0. Much, but by no means all, of Carters evidence is technical. And hes unquestionably found an inconsistency in the Russia narrative that ought to raise doubts in even the most computer illiterate congressmans mind. &gt;**Julian Assanges Threat** &gt;But first, why on earth would a private contractor hired by the DNC engage in such tactics? For motive, we need to go back to June 12, 2016, when Wikileaks founder Julian Assange made an announcement that was sure to worry Hillary Clinton and her closest advisers: &gt;*We have upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton . . . We have emails pending publication.* &gt;A little less than three months earlier, on March 19, hostile actors had gotten ahold of all the emails in campaign chairman John Podestas main Gmail account. You may have heard that Podestas emails were hacked, but they werent. There were no faraway cyber-nerds searching for some vulnerability in the DNC network. He fell for a common spear phishing scam. A fake email from Google arrived, saying he needed to change his password and providing a link. The link was also fake. Instead of changing his password, Podesta gave it awayalong with all of his campaign emails. &gt;Whoops! &gt;The Clinton campaign learned of Podestas blunder almost immediately and must have suspected that the emails Assange was threatening to release were his. Moreover, on that date, a lot of the revelations contained therein would have been salientand not in a good way. &gt;Just six days before, with Clinton still 570 delegates short of the 2,382 needed to win the Democratic nomination, the [Associated Press](URL angered Bernie Sanders and his supporters by claiming that shed already won. [The New York Times](URL [CNN](URL [NBC](URL News, [USA Today](URL and The Washington Post all followed suit, declaring Sanders loss a fait accompli. &gt;But it wasnt. &gt;The AP arrived at its numbers by polling unpledged superdelegates, who couldnt vote until the convention and were free to change their minds or even to deceive the AP. &gt;Sanders supporters had been angry about the role superdelegates played in the nominating process for [months](URL [Sanders](URL himself complained about it just one week before Assanges announcement and a day before the media began writing his campaigns obituary: &gt;*My problem is that the process today has allowed Secretary Clinton to get the support of over 400 superdelegates before any other Democratic candidate was in the race.* &gt;The next days headlines prematurely declaring Clintons victory brought Sanders supporters long-simmering anger to a boil. His spokesman blasted the corporate medias rush to judgement: &gt;*Secretary Clinton does not have and will not have the requisite number of pledged delegates to secure the nomination. She will be dependent on superdelegates who do not vote until July 25 and who can change their minds between now and then.* &gt;For the rest of the week, the big election story was whether Sanders would exit the race gracefully and encourage his followers to forgive, forget, and rally round Hillary Clinton. But just 12 hours after Assanges announcement, [Sanders](URL emerged from a meeting with his top advisors, refusing to concede and reiterating his determination not to let the media gaslight his candidacy into a lost cause: &gt;*[W]e are going to take our campaign to the convention with the full understanding that were very good in arithmetic and that we know who has received the most votes up until now* &gt;**The Immensity of Podestas Blunder** &gt;Podestas blunder had the potential to damage Hillary Clintons already precarious reputation with voters regardless of their feelings about Bernie Sanders. In some of his pilfered emails, top Clinton advisors, including [Podesta](URL himself, insulted [her](URL [abilities](URL [and](URL her [ethics](URL commented on her [poor health](URL made disparaging remarks about [Catholics](tldrify.com/qw2), [Muslims, blacks](URL and [Latinos](tldrify.com/qw3), and complained that Clinton wanted [unaware and compliant voters.](tldrify.com/qw1) &gt;Many of Podestas emails also [contradict](URL claims made in defense of the private email server Clinton used as Secretary of State. Others reveal that the FBI investigation into the matter was [anything](tldrify.com/qw7) [but](URL [unbiased](tldrify.com/qw9). At a minimum, the emails prove the Clinton campaign [knew](URL from the beginning that she was breaking the law. &gt;Its easy to forget how serious an issue Clintons private server was on June 12, 2016, three weeks before FBI Director James Comey publicly exonerated her. A few weeks earlier, the State Department had sharply rebuked Clinton for violating department rules, generating unpleasant headlines like, [Hillary Clintons email problems just got much worse.](URL &gt;A June 1 Morning Consult [poll](URL found that about half of voters thought her private email server was illegal, unethical and a major problem, with a quarter of Democrats agreeing. Theres little question that Assanges threat would have made the poll disturbingly salient to Clinton and her top advisers. &gt;But, given Sanders supporters anger and Clintons need for their enthusiastic support to prevail against Trump, her team would have been more concerned about emails revealing her disdain for Sanders supporters and some of their most beloved progressive policies. &gt;For example, Clinton secretly opposed [gay marriage](URL and supported [fracking](tldrify.com/qwf). She and other top campaign officials regularly [insulted](URL Sanders and his supporters. Making matters worse, Podestas emails also revealed that CNN contributor [Donna Brazile](URL gave Clinton at least three questions in advance for her debates with Sanders. And an extraordinary number of emails confirm Sanders supporters suspicions that the [DNC](URL and the mainstream [media](URL were colluding with Clinton to torpedo his candidacy from its inception. &gt;But perhaps the most troubling of Podestas emails would have been those containing passages from speeches Clinton gave to Goldman Sachs and other big money outfits at $225,000 a pop. In these speeches, Clinton [downplayed](URL Wall Streets role in the 2008 recession and [said](URL big money bankers themselves are best equipped to write any necessary legislation. &gt;Clinton in those speeches also [conceded](URL that her economic fortunes put her obviously out of touch with the struggles middle-class voters face. She further [admitted](URL that she has distinct public and private positions on political issues, and [revealed](URL that she secretly favors open borders. &gt;Like the controversy over her private server, Clinton weathered this storm so well that its hard to remember how much her unreleased speeches alarmed Sanders supporters, to whom she was little more than a corporate shill. Sanders had been using Clintons speeches as a [laugh line](URL in his own [stump](URL speeches for [months:](URL &gt;*If youre going to give a speech for $225,000 its gotta be really, dont you think an extraordinarily brilliant speech, I mean why else would they pay that kind of money? . . . Must be a speech written in Shakespearean prose. So I think, if it is such a fantastic speech, the secretary should make it available to all of us.* &gt;To make matters worse, three weeks before Assanges announcement, Clinton released a mandatory financial statement that brought her Wall Street speeches to the forefront of campaign news, yielding headlines like, [How corporate America bought Hillary Clinton for $21M](URL and [The massive scale of the Clintons speech-making industry.](URL &gt;A few days later, reporters even annoyed [President Obama](URL at a G7 summit in Japan by asking him whether she ought to release her speeches. On June 1, just 11 days before Assanges announcement, a [Morning Consult](URL poll had 64 percent of voters saying she should, including two-thirds of independents and almost half of Democrats. &gt;Some readers have likely forgotten the many serious political headaches Hillary Clinton suffered in the week preceding Assanges June 12 announcement and how desperately she needed to placate Sanders angry supporters. If you werent too distracted by the Russia narrative, however, you probably remember some of the above revelations from Podestas emails that would have made doing so impossible had Assange not given Clintons camp so much time to prepare. &gt;By October 7, when Wikileaks finally began releasing Podestas emails, Democrats had been taught to tune them out by angrily reciting the mantras Putin and Russia. CNN told viewers it would be illegal for folks who didnt work for [CNN](URL or some other CNN-approved corporation to so much as look at the emails. Trump couldnt push Wikileaks because doing so immediately rebounded back at him, raising worries he might be Putins puppet, rather than reflecting poorly on Clinton. &gt;**Clinton Uses the Russia Narrative to Great Effect** &gt;Whether Adam Carter is right that the DNC hack was a ruse designed to deflect the damaging Podesta emails, there is no question Clinton and her surrogates were instantly prepared to use it for that purpose. &gt;Within hours of Assanges October 7 release, Podesta made a transparent attempt on [Twitter](URL to tie anything damaging in his emails to insidious Russian interference: &gt;*2. Im not happy about being hacked by the Russians in their quest to throw the election to Donald Trump. John Podesta (@johnpodesta)* &gt;Clinton first publicly addressed Podestas emails 12 days later in her third [debate](URL with Trump: &gt;*But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks. What is really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans. They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions. Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the internet. This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government. Clearly from Putin himself in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election. So, I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this, and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in this election.* &gt;A more transparent attempt to tie Wikileaks, espionage against Americans, Russian government, and Donald Trump to any damaging disclosures that might surface from Podestas emails would be impossible. &gt;So, by October 7 tainting Podestas emails with a Russian provenance was demonstrably the Clinton campaigns go-to strategy. But a Washington Post story about the DNC hack published two days after June 12 Assanges threat on June 12 shows the strategy was prepared much earlier. &gt;**CrowdStrikes Remarkable Announcement and Guccifer 2.0s Debut** &gt;The June 14 Washington Post article is the first time the DNC went public about the alleged Russian hack. It includes the detail that the hackers stole a file of Trump opposition research; which, though no ordinary readers could have known it at the time, would turn up [months later](URL when Wikileaks released Podestas emails. &gt;Indeed, this detail is also the articles big takeaway, as its mentioned in both the lead sentence and the headline: [Russian government hackers penetrated DNC, stole opposition research on Trump.](URL &gt;The story extensively quotes CrowdStrike President Shawn Henry, who previously headed the FBIs cybersecurity division, and Chief Technology Officer Dmitri Alperovitch; all information was provided voluntarily by CrowdStrike and the DNC. According to [Alperovitch](URL they decide[d] to go public with information about their incident and give us permission to share our knowledge. &gt;So, why did the DNC want the world to know on June 14 the embarrassing fact that the Russians had hacked their server and the content of one pilfered file? &gt;[Alperovitch](URL says they wanted to help protect even those who do not happen to be [CrowdStrike] customers. But they must have had a more self-interested motive to justify again publicly connecting Hillary Clintons name to lost emails and unsecure servers while Comeys investigation was still a very serious campaign issue. &gt;Clintons team had to suspect Assange had Podestas emails and knew the Trump opposition-research file was among them. So announcing that the Russians had stolen the file two days after Assanges threat is, in hindsight, either an incredible coincidence or the first step in a strategy to taint the damaging information in Podestas emails with Russian perfidy. &gt;But CrowdStrike and the DNC werent the only ones calling attention to the stolen Trump opposition file. The very next day, a new actor appeared, calling himself Guccifer 2.0, and claiming to be the very hacker mentioned by Alperovitch in the Washington Post story. &gt;And, to prove it, he [posted](URL 230 pages of Trump opposition research on his newly minted [blog](URL and emailed copies to [Gawker](URL and [The Smoking Gun](URL &gt;We are now supposed to think that Guccifer 2.0 was a Russian spy passing documents he hacked from the DNC server to Wikileaks. In fact, this is the only evidence that Russia hacked the DNC besides CrowdStrikes unverified examination of their server. &gt;But if G2 really is a Russian spy, Russia ought to be pitied rather than sanctioned. &gt;When he debuted taking credit for the hack mentioned in the previous days Post, G2 made no attempt to deny he was a Russian spy. Anyone reading his blog post who was also familiar with the Poststory would assume that he must be a Russian spy as it claims. Would a real Russian spy pretending to be something else connect himself to a report outing him as a Russian spy without denying it? Why would he connect himself to such a report at all? &gt;Would a real Russian spy trying to hide his identity end the second sentence in his first blog post with ))), the [symbol](URL that Russians use in place of our lol. G2 [did](URL &gt;And, would a Russian spy working with Wikileaks to discredit Hillary Clinton announce to the world that hes working with Wikileaks? G2s advertising that connection, not denying hes a Russian spy, and using Russian emoticons had the completely predictable effect of tying Assange to Putin and thus discrediting any Wikileaks releases that might otherwise have harmed Clinton. &gt;G2 denied being Russian only after it emerged that he left Russian fingerprints all over the documents he released. Odd enough by itself, given the superb operational tradecraft, [attributed](URL to him by Alperovitch. &gt;But Carter and his intrepid virtual friends examination of the fingerprints revealed that, rather than accidentally leaving them, G2 went out of his way to [plant](tldrify.com/qys) them. &gt;The first evidence of Russian involvement was found within hours of G2s June 15 debut. Someone at Gawker looked at the metadata in the files he sent and discovered the name of the founder of the Soviet secret police written in the Russian [alphabet!](URL No real Russian spy would be so careless. And if we werent so desperate for sensational news, a Gawker reporter finding evidence connecting G2 with Russian intel mere hours after his debut by itself would have raised red flags about the Russia narrative. &gt;G2 also [chose](tldrify.com/qye) to use a company based in Russia to cloak his IP address. Even then, there are plenty of email providers that would conceal the Russian IP. Yet G2, who Hillary Clinton suggested clearly took orders directly from KGB prodigy Vladimir Putin, somehow chose one that didnt. &gt;If G2 had simply done nothing, there would have been nothing connecting Wikileaks to Russia. Instead of doing nothing, he went out of his way to connect Wikileaks Clinton releases to Russian intelligence. Yet, somehow, were supposed to think he was out to hurt Clinton. And, despite [claiming](URL to be Clintons enemy, neither the Trump opposition file nor any of the other files he released with it contained anything [damaging](URL to her. &gt;So a Russian spy intent on getting Trump elected released 230 pages of damaging information on Trump but nothing negative about Hillary Clinton? &gt;Viewed in quick and haphazard slices, G2s debut may look like a collaboration with Putin and Assange. But Russian spies trying to hide their identity dont openly confess to crimes the Washington Post has attributed to Russian spies the day before. &gt;Nor do they use Russian emoticons. &gt;Nor do they reveal their connections to organizations secretly shilling for them. &gt;Nor do they intentionally plant evidence of their identity. &gt;And when Russian spies release 230 pages of negative information about Donald Trump, its Trump, and not his enemies, they are trying to harm. &gt;When we widen our view, the suggestion that G2 is a Russian spy is revealed as a naked insult to the nations intelligence. &gt;**Where Did Guccifer 2.0 Get the Trump File?** &gt;Hindsight together with Carter and crews hard work shows that G2, rather than trying to harm Clinton, worked to manufacture a fake connection between Assange and Russian intel. This fake connection would later be used by Clinton to deflect the avalanche of damaging information in Podestas emails when Assange released them. &gt;The Washington Post headline that the Russians hacked a Trump opposition document from the DNC set the stage. But the article made no mention of Assange or Wikileaks. So, considered alone, it had zero potential to discredit any damaging Wikileaks releases. &gt;G2 forged the crucial link to Assange the next day; by taking credit for the hack and claiming to have turned over the spoils to Wikileaks. His release of the Trump opposition file, which would later turn up when Wikileaks finally released Podestas emails, would also then provide confirmation for his story about being the hacker; and, as a result, strengthen the links between Putin and Assange he was creating. &gt;Absent G2 bringing Wikileaks into the picture, the Washington Post story would have informed voters of an embarrassing Russian DNC hack of some Trump opposition research, without any mitigating way to connect those Russians to Julian Assange, and thereby discrediting him. &gt;So the information released to the Post serves no purpose and, indeed, would harm Clinton, unless CrowdStrike knew G2 would immediately enter the fray and shift attention away from Russian intels breach of the DNC server and towards speculation about Russian intels connection to Wikileaks. &gt;But theres another more conclusive reason to think that G2 had to be working with CrowdStrike and Hillary Clinton. &gt;Remember, on June 15, Guccifer 2.0 emailed a Trump opposition file to [Gawker](URL and [The Smoking Gun](URL and posted it on his [blog](URL But we now know, apart from the Russian fingerprints he planted, the very same Trump opposition file was among Podestas emails when Assange released them four months later. &gt;So, how did G2 get ahold of a file from John Podestas emails? Thats what Adam Carter wants everyone to start asking. &gt;Since G2 manifestly isnt the implacable enemy of Hillary Clinton he pretended to be, its unlikely that he hacked the DNC server as claimed. And, Carter and other experts [say](URL his claims arent technically credible, anyway. &gt;Given how hard G2 worked to discredit Wikileaks, neither is it credible that he got the file through them. &gt;Without the Trump file, G2 might have just been some unconnected third-party trolling Julian Assange. But the fact that G2 possessed a file from Podestas emails seems inexplicable, given everything else we now know, unless G2 is part of a CrowdStrike disinformation campaign to protect Hillary Clinton from the consequences of John Podestas blunder. &gt;The foundations of both Robert Muellers investigation and the sanctions placed on Russia appear to have crumbled into dust. &gt;Lets hope our political class notices.

31,cyber-crime,conspiracy,Washington DC Navy Yard shooting linked to CID investigation and attempted arrest of Obama for treason,9,8gnvun,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8gnvun/washington_dc_navy_yard_shooting_linked_to_cid/,2018-05-03 14:57:33," Link URL U.S. civilian contractors and military police were targeted and killed by Obama in the Washington DC Navy Yard shooting. Why? Agents from the U.S. militarys Criminal Investigation Command (CID) had uncovered a plot to detonate a nuclear device in the heart of the nations capitol as part of an Obama government false flag. Officials from NCIS (United States Naval Criminal Investigative Service) and the U.S. Office of the Provost (both with field offices inside the Washington DC Navy Yard) had threatened to arrest Obama for planning to attacked Syria without Congressional approval following a planned nuclear detonation false flag in Washington DC. The Office of the Provost is on the second floor of Building 34, One First Avenue, Charlestown Navy Yard and NCIS is located at 716 SICARD STREET SE, SUITE 2000, WASHINGTON NAVY YARD, DC. The United States Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) is the primary law enforcement agency of the United States Department of the Navy. It investigates activities concerning crimes against or by United States Navy and United States Marine Corps personnel, along with national security, counter-intelligence, and counter-terrorism cases. A false flag is the crime of treason  levying war against the United States. If United States Navy or United States Marine Corps personnel are involved in planning for and preparing a false flag event in Washington DC or anywhere else in the United States, NCIS and its agents (CID Agents assigned to NCIS are normally dressed in appropriate civilian attire) are duty bound to investigate and take action to counter those terrorist acts against the United States. Prior to the Washington DC Navy Yard shooting the Joint Chief of Staff and Provost Marshals were reportedly planning and preparing to arrest Obama for treason. For levying war against the United States after a planned false flag in Washington DC on the anniversary of 9/11  a nuclear detonation. In the United States the Office of the Provost has the authority to arrest the President if he or she violates the terms of his/her employment, or commits an act that is detrimental to the United States. He/she can be held liable, arrested, imprisoned etc., depending on the depth of the violation, by the Provost Marshal. If it has been determined that the president of the United States has committed treason in a manner unmistakable to all, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff convenes a covert meeting (in this case the Washington DC Navy Yard) to get a vote of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Provost Marshall General of the Army and/or Marines will usually be in attendance. Remember that a military officer takes an oath of office to do one thing and one thing only  . to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against ALL enemies, foreign OR DOMESTIC. They must determine above a reasonable doubt that the enemy domestic is the treasonous president before they can attempt to arrest him or her. Once the Joint Chiefs of Staff have determined beyond a reasonable doubt that the president has committed treason a convoy of 10 to 12 HIGH ranking officers (13 killed at the Navy Yard) depart the Pentagon, accompanied by a large contingency of Military Police (Provost Marshals, NCIS agents) and all necessary armament and provisions to enter the grounds of the White House, by FORCE if necessary, and proceed to the location of the president and put him under arrest. Then, The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff would advise the Speaker of The House, The President of the Senate, The Attorney General and the Secretary of State of their actions. Obamas response to the threat of arrest was a assault against NCIS civilian clad agents who uncovered the false flag plot against the United States and Provost Marshals who threatened to arrest Obama at the Washington DC Navy Yard. Dont be fooled by reports stating that the shooter targeted and killed civilians. Those killed were all members of the U.S. militarys Criminal Investigation Command (CID). The White House (Obama) purposely left this fact out of incident reports and news media reports as it would raise alarm bells in Washington DC should the public know Joint Chiefs of Staff members, Provost Marshals and NCIS agents (normally wear civilian attire) were targeted and killed for investigating Obama and threatening to arrest him for treason. On September 28, 2009 the History Channel released a movie titled Day After Disaster. The entire movie is about Washington DC being the target and victim of a nuclear detonation. The movie also features Obama talking about nuclear detonations in the U.S. Movie 0.50 time stamp  One terrorist, one nuclear weapon could unleash massive destruction ~ Obama says. Last year PRESS Core wrote an article titled COG planning for and preparing Washington DC nuclear detonation false flag event. after receiving information that September 30, 2012 was the day Day after Disaster was to executed in real-time. Obamas planned false flag attack for September 30, 2012 was averted after the public was made aware of the false flag beginning August 18th, 2012. Obamas 9/11 anniversary false flag was thwarted when the Joint Chief of Staff and the Provost Marshals from the Washington DC Navy Yard confronted Obama and threatened to arrest him for treason for planning to detonate one or more nukes in the nations capitol  Washington DC. The EU Times reported June 27, 2013  Obama Requests 15,000 Russian Troops For Upcoming Disaster In that story it claims Obama has requested at least 15,000 Russian troops trained in disaster relief and crowd functions [i.e. riot control] be pre-positioned to respond to FEMA Region III during an unspecified upcoming disaster. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Region III includes Delaware,Washington, D.C (formally the District of Columbia) , Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia areas. According to this report, this unprecedented request was made directly to Minister Vladimir Puchkov by US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Director Janet Napolitano (now retired) who said these Russian troops would work directly and jointly with her Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), part of whose mission is to secure the continuity of the US government in the event of natural disasters or war. Obama brings in Russian soldiers to police U.S. after false flag This report has been verified. The origins of this report can be read on the website of Ministry of the Russian Federation for Affairs for Civil Defence, Emergencies and Elimination of Consequences of Natural Disasters  or internationally as EMERCOM of Russia  The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry and the USA Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are going to exchange experts during joint rescue operations in major disasters. This is provided by a protocol of the fourth meeting of the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission Working Group on Emergency Situations and seventeenth meeting of Joint U.S.-Russia Cooperation Committee on Emergency Situations, which took place in Washington on 25 June. In addition, the parties approved of U.S. Russian cooperation in this field in 2013-2014, which envisages exchange of experience including in monitoring and forecasting emergency situations, training of rescuers, development of mine-rescuing and provision of security at mass events.

The only way anyone could know that there is a natural disaster  the likes of which the nation has never seen  is also likely on its way is if you are the one planning and preparing it. You also will have to prepare for the increasing likelihood of more weather-related events of a more severe nature as a result of climate change, and continue to build the capacity to respond to potential disasters in far-flung regions of the country occurring at the same time.

Legal definition for conspiracy  An agreement between two or more persons to engage jointly in an unlawful or criminal act, or an act that is innocent in itself but becomes unlawful when done by the combination of actors.

A conspiracy is an indictable offense wherein  two or more persons engage jointly in an unlawful or criminal act.

It was looking like we were about to see these conflicts finally come to a end. Now, alleged chemical attacks on the last active terrorists in Syria are being used to justify Western intervention that prolongs a vicious campaign aimed at making Syria an Islamic state. The last remaining militants in Douma, Eastern Ghouta, are the Army of Islam (Jaysh al-Islam), supplied and funded by Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are great friends with America and Britain, and their largest customer for military equipment. The voracious war machines of America and Britain are threatened not by any enemy, but by the absence of one. This conflict is good news for the military and arms industries. Israel hates Syria and Iran, and would like to see those strong nations collapsed and fragmented. The media has leapt onto the bandwagon, laying blame for this alleged attack on Syria and, ominously, Russia and Iran. Their crime is to support the Syrian government in its fight against an array of Islamic fighters who would stop at nothing to impose their version of Islam on that secular nation. Israel has already attacked an unrelated Syrian airfield, in response to this unfounded allegation. Not for a moment could the Trumps, Theresa Mays, and Macrons of this world believe that Assad launched this attack. It is as clearly fake as the WMD for which there was never evidence. For the legitimate Syrian government the battle for Damascus was virtually over, with 90% of Eastern Ghouta recaptured, with the militants and their families safely evacuated to Idlib Province, allowed to keep their belongings, including their personal handgun or AK-47. Only Douma was still controlled by the Army of Islam, who held 3,500 hostages prisoner, mostly Syrian military, their family, or sympathisers. They rained shells upon Damascus daily, and received return bombardment, but had no chance of military victory, none whatsoever. There was only one strategy that could prolong the struggle  to bring in Western military support. Their only way to prompt this was a staged chemical weapons attack, choreographed by the infamous [White Helmets](URL who have form on this. It is alleged that real victims were taken from their hostage stock. The White Helmets were extensively trained by their [Western backers](URL in the arts of propaganda, and make great use of children. After their final fling, even the Army of Islam now appears to be leaving Douma under safe conduct. With no rational reason whatsoever to rain rockets on Syria, some emotional video provides the excuse for our macho leaders to make war on that ancient cradle of civilization. President Trumps reputation is on the line, with May and Macron wanting in on the act. This is more like bukakke than war, unless Russia becomes engaged, in which case the military will have their hot war, may the gods help us. Our ruling elite want Russia back as a fearful enemy and magnifies or fabricates whatever it it can to foster this unfounded paranoia. Back when Russia threatened to spread communism across the free West, Americans understandably built bomb shelters and proudly proclaimed that theyd rather be dead than red. The US kept a fleet of nuclear laden B-52 bombers in the air 24/7, just in case. It was an ideological clash that ended in 1991 with the dissolution of communism and the Soviet Union. But Russia was the best enemy the West ever had, and we witness a monumental effort to re-instate it as a fearful threat to our democracy, way of life, and cyber security. Hogwash. They just keep faking news to make war! The first Gulf War was fuelled by an emotional report of babies being taken out of incubators by Iraqi forces. A [public relations firm](URL created that story, using the Kuwaiti ambassadors daughter as the [video](URL witness. The second Iraq war was based on fake WMD. Destruction of Libya based on a phoney attempt to protect the people of Libya from their evil ruler. Ditto Syria, a successful secular nation with a strong army having no mission other than to protect its homeland. All this calculated conflict is funded by our hard-earned taxes, and sadly, this is what ruling elites do and have done for a millennia or two. Without our fear of the enemy, we might start questioning the need to be owned by a big shepherd and directed by their sheepdogs  dogs well trained to do whatever they are told. We might stop worrying about what we would do without the state and start wondering about what we could do in a state of connection and freedom."

34,cyber-crime,conspiracy,How A CIA-DOJ-FBI Team Forged The Trump-Russia Dossier,0,7kiubj,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7kiubj/how_a_ciadojfbi_team_forged_the_trumprussia/,2017-12-18 15:10:06,"...To the shock and dismay of those crooked bureaucrats, the credibility of the Trump-Russia Dossier is collapsing now that the House Intelligence Committee has disclosed that veteran Department of Justice (DOJ) official Bruce Genesoke Ohr was in secret contact with the reports British author Christopher Steele. Its also surfaced that his colleague-wife Nellie Hauke Ohr, a CIA analyst, worked for months prior to the presidential election on salary at Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm hired for the faked report on Trumps alleged Russian connections, a hit job paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), although the source of funding was likely a secret slush fund in the Clinton Foundation. Here, the relationships between the members of the dossier team are laid out in chronological order (despite numerous missing links due to their bureaucratic secrecy). The conspirators are frequently referred to as spies, operatives, agents and traitors due to willful violation of their oaths to uphold the U.S. Constitution, as required of management-level personnel at the CIA, FBI and DOJ. Of course, these treacherous government bureaucrats did not act on their own but are minions of the Democratic Party leadership and its organized-crime benefactors. Moscow Mules The Ohrs relationship with the retired MI-6 spy Christopher Steele, the supposed author of the Russia Dossier, began at least than three years ago, long before Trump contemplated a presidential bid and in all likelihood much earlier during the FIFA soccer investigation. In his role as Assistant Deputy Director at DOJ, Bruce Ohr met Steele in Russia in mid-May 2013 at the third St. Petersburg International Legal Forum. The Korean-American Ohr presented a paper titled Criminal Matters and Allegations of Crimes in International Arbitration, a choice of topic timed to undermine Russian counter-claims in the Magnitsky affair. In hindsight its ironic that his lecture synopsis included an apt description of the yet to-be drafted Russia Dossier: a party (in a dispute) may introduce false testimony or forged documents. At the time of that annual conference sponsored by the Russian Federations Justice Ministry, the Kremlin was locked in a controversy over U.S. congressional retaliation for the 2009 prison death of Russian-Jewish accountant Sergei Magnitsky. As auditor for Hermitage Capital, co-owned by British-American financier Bill Browder, Magnitsky was investigating dozens of Russian tycoons allied with President Vladimir Putin as to their links with organized crime figures. Who paid for this monumental survey remains unclear, although a likely conduit of funding was the MI-6 team in Moscow, which had been led until his retirement by agent Chris Steel. Federal attorney Bruce Ohr was then chief of the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section, which had a keen interest in shady businessmen who were moving their capital holdings into American financial institutions and the U.S. real-estate market with the intent of money laundering. Surveillance of transnational drug-trafficking was also part of his role as head of DOJs international drug-trafficking investigations. (His cyber-surveillance network would later focus, outside of its authority, on the activities of Trump adviser Carter Page in Russia and Croatia.) Agent Steele was in attendance at St. Petersburg due to the fact that a Russian Interior Ministry official had filed a lawsuit in London against Hermitage Capital. This Russian attempt at legal judo in a British court was prompting the UK Foreign Office to patch up diplomatic relations with Moscow and depoliticize crime issues. With the Magnitsky affair gradually simmering down, the next target for Anglo-American intelligence cooperation was the upcoming Moscow and St. Petersburg event-planning visit, scheduled for just a month later, by Miss Universe impresario Donald Trump. Under the Church Committee rules, U.S. intelligence agencies are banned from spying on American citizens abroad, and therefore the private-eye surveillance by Steele, a Briton, was negotiated to keep watch for possible Russian mafia involvement in the high-profile beauty contest. As it turned out, Miss Venezuela was crowned Miss Universe 2013, meaning Ohr had wasted a lot of American taxpayer money on a wild goose chase. That dated information from 2013 was recycled three years later into the Russia Dossier. Orbis London As part of Five Eyes intelligence cooperation between Anglo-Saxon countries, the DOJ/FBI cooperates with the UK Ministry of Justice (MOJ) during investigations within the Commonwealth and the EU, much like the fictional partnership of the CIAs Felix Leiter and James Bond. Not much earlier, in 2006, Steele served as head of the MI-6 Russia desk. On his retirement from government service in 2009, he co-founded a for-hire investigative firm called Orbis Business Intelligence, which produced a series of 100 reports on the Ukraine-Russia crisis, which erupted in 2014, on contract with the U.S. State Department. In other words, the main author of the Trump-Russia Dossier had a lucrative contract under Secretary of State Hillary Clinton before her presidential campaign. There is a strong possibility that Bruce Ohr met Steele as early as 2010. The FBI, which in international operations is synonymous with DOJ, traveled to London for a briefing by Orbis on the Sepp Blatter corruption scandal at FIFA. The Feds were interested in the role of organized crime in match-fixing as related to worldwide online gambling. The score-rigging was allegedly arranged by a Singaporean syndicate and Malaysian-Macanese gambling boss Paul Phua, who was later entrapped by a joint CIA-DOJ/FBI sting operation at the Las Vegas Sands. As chief of the DOJ international organized crime bureau, Bruce Ohr likely attended the London briefing, where he would have been first introduced to veteran spy Christopher Steele. Married to the CIA Before proceeding, mention must be given to Nellie Hauke Ohrs role as a CIA analyst. Bruce Ohr shares his room with a view at the Robert F. Kennedy Building, the DOJ headquarters, with his wife Nellie, which indicates that the married couple are part of a high-level inter-agency intelligence team. Ohrs office is on the executive 4th floor, just four doors down from the suite of then Deputy Director Sally Quillian Yates, and since late April her replacement Rod Rosenstein. A virtual unknown to the press and public, the low-visibility Ohr served as the assistant to Rosenstein, following the latters transfer from the Maryland DOJ office, showing the newcomer the ropes and keeping watch on him on behalf of Yates, Loretta Lynch, Holder and, ultimately, Barack Obama and the Clintons. Ohr, in short, is a partisan watchdog for the Democratic establishment, whos shown absolutely no respect for the Constitution. The role of the Ohrs in joint operations and surveillance reveals how the CIA (whose charter forbids spying inside the borders) has operated a secret system of control over domestic law enforcement and, through it, the judicial branch. There are only five stories inside the RFK Building, the topmost housing the draconian tribunal known as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). Since these are the same ilk of insiders behind the series of unjustifiable wars, the 911 sabotage and assassination of the Kennedys, the buildings name is a warning to anyone who dares contemplate a challenge to the hidden alliance of organized crime, politicians and federal agents. The elimination of this cabal cannot be done piecemeal; they all must be knocked in a single sweep, as discussed below. The Ohrs are two operatives inside the very heart of a system of perpetual treason, far more dangerous to the principles of American democracy that the Rosenbergs who got the electric chair for much-lesser crimes. After examining their role in producing the dossier, this essay will go up the leadership ladder to identify their superiors. Out of Africa Espionage is a family tradition for Nellie Ohr, much as his maternal lineage has been for Barack Obama among the CIAs Dunham clan of Honolulu. Her mother Kathleen Armstrong Hauke was a Cold War liberal and promoter of racial integration in Atlanta, where she wrote biographies of pioneering leftist black journalist Ted Poston. Later in the late 1980s, Kathleen taught English in Nairobi, Kenya (two decades after Ann Dunham met her paramour Barack Obama Sr. in Kenya while on CIA assignment) Race-mixing was not solely an individual choice in that era, not when the CIA actively promoted interracial marriages in competition against the Soviet Unions propaganda of racial equality. The American South and Africa were two battlegrounds where mixed-blood youths, like Barack Obama Jr., were groomed as leaders by either side of the Cold War. The 2004 obituary of Kathleen Hauke mentioned that her daughter Nellie was a resident of McLean, Virginia the (township of the Langley neighborhood location of CIA headquarters). Fluent in the Russian language and Russophile, Nellie Hauke Ohr recently applied for a ham radio license, probably to maintain communications (external to hack-vulnerable cyberspace) with her anti-Putin contacts in Russia funded by the CIA and Soros. This apparently is in anticipation of Trumps cut-off of US funding for those clandestine subversive operations. Shortwave radio hearkens back to the late Cold War era, when Nellie would have monitored Russian signals for the CIA. Since that Stone Age for telecommunications, Nellie Ohr became part of the CIA cyber-intelligence program known as Open Source Works (OSW), discussed below, which explains her intelligence role inside Fusion GPS, the private investigation group that hired Orbis and Christopher Steele to draft the Trump-Russia Dossier. What a tangled web they weave! The Ohr-Steele encounter in St. Petersburg turned out to be the very seed from which sprang the Trump-Russia Dossier, in a handshake between the DOJ/FBI and MI-6. Just a month later, in June 2013, Donald Trump arrived with his advance team to make the arrangements for the Miss Universe pageant, scheduled for November 2013 at the Crocus hall in the Moscow suburb of Krasnogorsk. Plausible Deniability of Authorship Fusion GPS, the private investigation firm led by three former Wall Street Journal reporters, was hired by two different clients to go after Trump: - First, in late 2015, the Washington Free Beacon, owned by conservative financier and LGBT supporter Paul Singer commissioned a probe of Trump to bolster the candidacy of Marco Rubio (who has since been outed with allegations of his gay nightlife), but this early stab at Trump did not involve Russia; - Next in mid-2016, the Seattle law firm Perkins Coie, representing the Hillary Clinton Foundation and Democratic National Committee, hired Fusion GPS to probe the Russian relationships of Trump and his associates with the aim of discrediting and defeating his presidential campaign. By the Democratic National Convention, rigged against rival Bernie Sanders to guarantee the nomination of Hillary Clinton, her campaign team had foreknowledge of the Russian preference for Donald Trump, and the source of that information was obviously the CIA-DOJ team, which included the Ohrs. Besides intelligence gathering from Russian sources, Open Source Works also had the technical capability to launch cyber attacks against the DNC, leaving behind bread crumbs from a faked Russian hack. This illicit political invervention also had support in London, Moscow and Kiev, due to the DOJ-FBI and State Department contracts with Steeles Orbis Intelligence group. In reality, there probably was next to nothing in direct Russian involvement. One of the supposed Russian-sponsored fake news centers turned out to be a USAID-Soros dominated region in Macedonia. On closer inspection, the entire Russian election interference is turning out to be an false-flag creation out of Langley and the RFK building. An Agency Cut-out Fusion GPS, therefore, was hired as a cut out, spy terminology for a neutral go-between created to shield the actual perpetrators in an exchange of stolen information. A psychological operation aimed at political intervention at this level required the direct involvement of and authorization from CIA director John Brennan and Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and this was to interfere in the elections in favor of their former colleague at State, Hillary Clinton, and not a matter of national security. Director of National Intelligence (DNI) James Clapper should have been aware of these illicit activities and was responsible for shutting down political subversion, meaning that he, too, bears some degree of responsibility for the bureaucratic assault on democracy. Fabricating the Dossier Christopher Steele provided some of the intelligence for the dossier, but much of the material strongly appears to be based on CIA and NSA intercepts of phone calls and emails, along with human intelligence from informants. There is also an equally strong possibility that many, perhaps most, of the claims in the dossier are fabrications, lies. Nellie Hauke Ohr and her husband at DOJ reviewed and copied from classified files for the dossier in blatant violation of intelligence regulations. The method of direct translation, for example, Russian regime without the article the, indicates the CIA protocol followed by Nellie Ohr in radio intercepts. The tiny lapse shows that source is not Moscow but Langley, Virginia. The notes from CIA and DOJ/FBI classified files, which Nellie Ohr compiled during her several months, during summer and autumn 2016, on the payroll of Fusion GPS while in Washington D.C.. Those materials were then laundered through Orbis for plausible deniability at the CIA. Fusion GPS paid the London-based firm more than $160,000, meaning the total budget for consultants, services, travel and communication was probably about a half-million dollars from the original source of funding (prior to DNC-Hillary, which was probably provided by a slush fund at the Clinton Foundation. To the heisted CIA material and forged information, Christopher Steele added his recollections from Donald Trumps Miss Universe visits in 2013, supplemented by whatever hearsay picked up immediately after the contest. Examination of the dossier is similar to the findings from a forensic autopsy on Frankensteins monster: A lot of body parts that dont fit together, laced together and patched with putty. Open Source Works Nellie Ohrs inchoate and disorganized editing, in contrast to the minimal standards at any daily newspaper, reveals the sloppiness thats the norm at her post inside the CIA bureau known as Open Source Works, which itself is highly classified and anything but open. In the Gutenberg era, open source referred to media in print, publications, as in Three Days of the Condor, which cast Robert Redford as a CIA analyst assigned to reading spy novels in search of leaks of classified information. The category of Open Source has vastly expanded in the Cyber-Age due to the explosive growth of electronic information and data, for example, Facebook pages, blogs and websites, but also any data accessible to hackers, including back accounts, wire transfers, medical records, email accounts, and GPS locations attached to smartphone photos. Private and even classified communications can be made Open Source by illegal interception or hacking and decryption, followed by disclosure through Wikileaks and Wikipedia, thereby scrubbed and transformed into public information, which can used to blackmail or silence targeted individuals. Open Source is now the major enterprise of the CIA in its effort to intimidate world leaders, corporate executives, military officers and media personalities. The Trump-Russia Dossier is an end-product of illicit CIA privacy violations, enhanced by selective editing and outright fabrication to incriminate the victim, in this case the President of the United States. The Frank Church amendments need to be upgraded to deal with terror by fake media, so that the offending bureaucrats and their political patrons can be locked away without access to cyberspace. Follow the Money Former DNC chairwoman Donna Brazile complained in her new book about being treated by Hillary insiders like a slave and denied a workable budget. Despite the penny-pinching to pay staff and expenses, the DNC and Hillary campaign generously forked over up to a half-million dollars for the Trump-Russia fabrication. The financial bursar for both entities was Dennis Cheng, the secretive mandarin in the shadows, who previously served as chief development officer (fundraising treasurer) of the Clinton Foundation, and also as finance director for Hillarys Senate race in New York State. Obviously, the non-for-profit Clinton Foundation, against U.S. Treasury regulations for nonprofits, was illegally used a political slush fund and for black operations behind the Trump-Russia Dossier. The DOJ and Treasury Department has never once challenged the fraudulent bookkeeping by Cheng and his staff. The Buck Stops Just how high up does the sponsorship of the Trump-Russia Dossier go? Certainly, due to their management-level positions inside the Justice Department, Bruce and Nellie Ohr did not act on their own volition, not when hundreds of thousands up to millions of dollars were spent for the clandestine international effort to libel Trump and wage psychological warfare though the mainstream media. There are only 6 degrees of separation between the Ohrs and President Barack Obama: Bruce and Nellie Ohr - DOJ Deputy Director Sally Quillian Yates  Attorneys General Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder  Director of National Intelligence James Clapper  White Chief of Staff Denis McDonough  and President Barack Obama. Obama had to have known all along, even if the funding came from another (former) president, Bill Clinton. Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch insists that her tete-a-tete with Bill Clinton inside a private jet on the tarmac at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport on 28 June 2016 did not touch on the following topics: Benghazi, Hillarys email server and Brexit. The Attorney Generals list of denials, however, did not include the clandestine project being hatched inside her department, the Trump-Russia Dossier. One question that now remains: Is Attorney General Jeff Sessions being paralyzed by Democrat kompromat (the Russian term for compromising material used for blackmail)? If so, he get out of the line of fire and return to civilian life immediately. The near-total breadth and width of untrustworthy lawyers at DOJ/FBI means that the Trump administration has only one recourse: appoint a special crisis team from the military Judge Advocate Generals Corps (JAG) to take over control of the RFK Building in a crisis intervention on grounds of constitution principles. The CIA has long outlived any usefulness it might once have had, and should be shut down. Far more dangerous than any terrorist threat, the culprits behind the current fake news coup against the presidency should all be retired to a 5-star Caribbean resort like the one called Guantanamo.

They take their name from the town of Erlach which produced a division of Swiss Guard and mercenaries that served German princes and the French monarch. Today their Erlacherhof mansion is the office for the mayor of Bern. The family still lives in Switzerland and is involved in banking and law. The company CMS von Erlach Poncet operates in Switzerland providing tax law services internationally and is headed up by Chairman Cornelius Brandi and he is an expert with corrupt loopholes involving tax law. Ernst Brandi and his son Albrecht Brandi were involved with the Nazis. The Nazis were involved in creating and running the Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland. Banking in Switzerland is private and enables the concealment of wealth and more importantly making illegal pay offs. Criminals working at CMS von Erlach Poncet are the advisers of Swiss bankers. Some top criminal Swiss bankers include Prince Lorenz of Belgium running Gutzwiller Bank, Archduke Sigismund of Habsburg-Lorraine covertly managing Swiss accounts for royals and covertly overseeing Landolt &amp; Cie, Banquiers, Prince Eric Sturdza running Banque Eric Sturdza, Baron Benjamin de Rothschild running Edmond de Rothschild Group, and Prince Maximilian of Liechtenstein running Liechtenstein Global Trust with Swiss branches. The Stella family of Piedmonte are a merchant and banking family which established Banca Sella Group in Italy with offices in Switzerland and working as the Court Factors for the merchant-banking princely House of Borromeo. ABN AMRO is primarily owned by the House of Orange-Nassau through proxy share holding companies and has a Zurich branch. The Nassau-Weilberg family of Luxembourg have part ownership over some banks in Luxembourg where banking is also private. Mid Eastern royal families also have proxy banks set up all over Switzerland. These banks are in contract with other larger Swiss banks including the Bank for International Settlements which is located in Basel, Switzerland and works with various central banks around the world. The BIS is involved in siphoning off wealth from nations through fraudulent tax contracts and also involved in managing international financial transactions used for making pay offs disguised as loans. Charitable foundations are also involved in making payoffs. These pay offs go to regional or local managers of secret societies and criminal organizations which tend to be Freemasons, papal knights, royal knights, and crime bosses which all generally own private businesses. They receive payoffs disguised as loans which they then distribute to their wage earners in secret societies and organized crime through cash or paypal accounts and these wage earners are involved in organized gang stalking, harassment, vandalism, making threats, spreading propaganda, cyber stalking, hacking, censorship, and even murder. The Bank for International Settlements has foreign agents from various nations involved and especially Italy which is leading this movement with Mario Draghi, Fabia Panetta, and Ignazio Visco as Board Directors for the BIS and all tied to Rome. The Bank for International Settlements is designed as a tower and is a loan tower managed by the Torlonia banking family of Rome. Tor means tower in French and lonia is like loan. The Torlonia family are intermarried with the royal family of Luxembourg and Prince Guillaume of Luxembourg worked for the IMF and former Minister of Finance in Luxembourg Luc Frieden was Chairman of the Board of Governors for the IMF and World Bank Group. The International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group are both headquartered in Washington DC and operate in the same way making criminal pay offs disguised as loans to nations and corporations for the purpose of globalization and human trafficking."
36,cyber-crime,conspiracy,Online Humiliation Tactics: The Powerful and the Powerless,26,7cdgeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7cdgeu/online_humiliation_tactics_the_powerful_and_the/,2017-11-12 15:45:08,"One of the first times I was linked to a mocking conspiracy sub (I will not name it), I had no idea what to expect. I saw the little robot on my post (bleep, bleep, boop), and I clicked the link. What I saw next I was not prepared for emotionally. I scrolled through the comments, and my eyes welled up with tears. I do not care if this is embarrassing because it is true. While no specific comment remains in my mind today, I felt humiliated. For the first time, I understood the new type of cruelty the internet can promote. It honestly took me a few days to recover. I was about to give up on posting on Reddit. Luckily, somebody on /r/c_s_t uplifted me, and I decided that I would never participate in a subreddit that humiliates another person. I thought about the subreddits I visited in the past that were made to mock users, and I realized I was in the wrong for enjoying subs like that. Unfortunately, it took me getting mocked myself to realize why it was wrong. I have written much about humiliation and degradation the past few years. Humiliation is a tactic, in my opinion, to keep people in line. From Psychology Today: Ritual humiliation in traditional societies can serve to enforce a particular social order, or, as also with hazing rituals, to emphasize that the group takes precedence over its individual members. Moreover, One important respect in which humiliation differs from embarrassment is that, whereas we bring embarrassment upon ourselves, humiliation is something that is brought upon us by others. Further, humiliation cuts deeper than embarrassment, and People who are in the process of being humiliated are usually left stunned and speechless, and, more than that, voiceless. It can be traumatic. URL I want to share a few times in my life that I have been deeply humiliated:  Growing up, my older sister had to baby sit me. She hated it. She used to beat us up regularly. Upon visiting my parents a few years later, they were laughing hysterically about this abuse. It was pure humiliation (and they could not understand why I was upset).  I was on vacation with my ex-boyfriend, and he was drinking. We had to drive to an event. He was in the passengers seat. I said something that pissed him off, and he started punching me while driving. I had to pull over, or else I was about to slam into traffic. He ripped off my shirt, and I had to stand there half naked, desperate and humiliated. *To humiliate someone is to assert power of them, and I was powerless.*  When I was a little girl, my dad told my mom that I had fat thighs. I was like 8 years old. I was humiliated as they both laughed about my body. (I was super skinny). There are thousands of incidents where I have been humiliated, and I only brought up ones that came to mind first. Further, I wanted to show that humiliation can happen at different levels. When I am linked to **unnamed sub**, it is about humiliation. They are asserting power over me, and they want to make me feel powerless. Really, it is public humiliation, and it is very common on Reddit. There are consequences to humiliation. The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and Law writes, Suffering severe humiliation has been shown empirically to plunge individuals into major depressions, suicidal states, and severe anxiety states, including ones characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder. Now, do not get me wrong. There are real circumstances where perhaps humiliation is a fit punishment for a crime or serves a purpose. However, I think these circumstances should be rare. In this post, I want to discuss why I believe humiliation tactics used on the internet, in general, are wrong. **But conspiracies are dangerous!** When people humiliate me online, this is the go to argument. They are claiming that since I am posting dangerous ideas, then I have a right to be humiliated to protect the nave. There is so much wrong with this argument, but lets just consider it. Lets say that everything I believe and write about is wrong, and that I am promoting dangerous ideology. If people want me to stop doing so, my argument is that humiliation will not work. According to Forbes, A person who feels humiliated retreats automatically to a defensive position and cant listen constructively. So, their behavior isnt going to change; theyre just going to hate and mistrust you. Their loyalty will be weakened and their motivation to succeed and make you look good will be diminished, if not damaged irreparably. Inevitably, humiliation is followed by anger or even rage, which becomes even more dangerous when that anger is suppressed and out of the person's awareness. URL According to the article, great leaders do not humiliate, and humiliation does not really work for correcting behavior. If people wanted me to change, the best way would not to be humiliate me, but rather, talk to me as a human. Now, lets just say that I am not crazy and what I am saying is true; then humiliation is even more dangerous. As noted earlier, humiliation can lead people to depression and suicide. When I noted how I felt at the beginning of this post, I was not exaggerating. I felt absolutely terrible. Chances are, subs that use humiliation tactics will eventually link to somebody who is not crazy. Subs like this may be humiliating the innocent. What happens to these people? Not everyone can be strong against harassment. This is what I CANNOT comprehend. In an age of equality and anti-bullying, we see more and more extremes in people who participate in this humiliation tactics. It is a complete contradiction. Also, I am not trying to create partisan issues here, but I know that many of these subreddits that do humiliate lean on the left. However, to counter that, I have participated in subs that lean on the right and attack and humiliate users as well. So, please note, this is not a partisan issue. It is a people issue. We are told to love all and not to bully, but this is hands down bullying. As somebody who was shamed and humiliated as a child, I now know it was emotional abuse: URL Though we are adults now, I now see clearly that adults can emotionally abuse one another. **Whats the answer?** This is quite simple, and it is quite corny, but I feel the answer is compassion, love, and kindness. Now, before I get attacked, I do not believe people should sit there and be walked all over. I think people have to defend themselves at times, and there are times for war, and times for peace. Further, there is probably a time and place for humiliation, but I think it should be rare and a last resort. But in general, in an idealistic environment, people would listen to one another. If we are really concerned about helping each other online, we would follow rules of Socratic and collegial discussion. As you may know, Socrates was a Greek philosopher who taught his students by asking questions. In schools, socratic seminars are used across the nation, and I believe socratic discussion should be used as a staple on online forums, especially conspiracy forums. Socratic discussion is not debate, as debate asserts that somebody is wrong and somebody is right. Socratic discussion is collaborative dialogue: Here are the tenets of Socratic discussion versus debate: Debate...  defends thinking to show that it is right  calls for investing in ones beliefs  searches for weaknesses  rebuts contrary positions and may devalue others  assumes a single right answer  demands a conclusion Dialogue...  expects others reflections will improve their own thinking  is temporarily suspending ones beliefs  searches for strengths  respects others and seeks not to alienate  assumes that cooperation can lead to greater understanding  remains open-ended (I took this from a PPT, so sorry no link). Now there is a time and place for debate, so I am not saying debating is wrong. However, I feel that people would learn much more if they participated in Socratic discussion. Further, even when debating, people can focus on tenets of collegial discussion: URL In a way, I feel forums can be treated like a classroom full of students. In a real classroom, a good teacher would not allow attacking, screaming, and other tactics we see in online forums. By the way, here are tactics that are commonly used to mess with online threads: URL The point is that collegial and Socratic discussion is possible, even online. It does not require humiliation, and even if people do not agree in the end, everybody can learn something. So, when we go back to the original argument, that some forums like **removed** exist to correct people and their dangerous views, I call bullshit. I think people can learn and change through some compassion and understanding. Think about a good teacher  they would never humiliate their students in order for them to learn a lesson. They would talk to the like a human being, and maybe the internet is making us lose humanity. **The Dangers of Humiliation** The internet has changed bullying, and I think for worse. In the past, the archetypal bully may have beat somebody after class (which is not good!), but now bullying tactics are much more subtle, dark, and manipulative. My students are evidence of this. Many have been victims of online harassment and bullying, and the consequences have been devastating. Here are some examples of the extreme consequences of online harassment and bullying (very sad read): URL Technology has changed things, and it will continue to do so. The internet has made people feel anonymous, and there are dangers to that. BBC writes, Technology makes transparency even more important because studies show people are more likely to behave in a dishonest or morally questionable way when they can hide behind it. A research paper Wasieleski co-authored in 2012 revealed that students cheat more often when technology makes it possible. The internet especially gives people the feeling of anonymity, as if they can get away with it without anybody knowing who did it. Proximity also makes a difference. People are less likely to behave badly when their victims are nearby, Wasieleski said. The web, of course, does a good job of making people feel far away from one another, and thus makes people more likely attack strangers online who might be on the other side of the globe. URL This is the question I like to ask whenever I write something online: Would I say this to this person in real life? If the answer is no, I do not post it. We have to remember there is a human behind the screen (for the most part). **Conclusion** I wrote this because I am attacked online daily. It gets exhausting, and tonight, after being questioned about my beliefs, I wanted to defend them. If you want to help somebody change, show them love and compassion. Hatred breeds more hatred  it is as simple as that! To end with a quote from Martin Luther King Jr: The ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral, begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy. Instead of diminishing evil, it multiplies it. Through violence you may murder the liar, but you cannot murder the lie, nor establish the truth. Through violence you may murder the hater, but you do not murder hate. In fact, violence merely increases hate. So it goes. Returning violence for violence multiplies violence, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr We live in a world where maybe we feel safer physically, but emotionally and spiritually, there are many battles. I suppose this post will likely be downvoted and attacked, but before you do so, I hope you can create discussion with me. Thank you for reading. "
37,cyber-crime,conspiracy,Julian Assange: The CIA director is waging war on truth-tellers like WikiLeaks,125,6w3phz,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6w3phz/julian_assange_the_cia_director_is_waging_war_on/,2017-08-26 14:36:53,"&gt;By Julian Assange April 25 &gt;Julian Assange is editor of WikiLeaks. &gt;Mike Pompeo, in his first speech as director of the CIA, chose to declare war on free speech rather than on the United States actual adversaries. He went after WikiLeaks, where I serve as editor, as a non-state hostile intelligence service. In Pompeos worldview, telling the truth about the administration can be a crime  as Attorney General Jeff Sessions quickly underscored when he described my arrest as a priority. News organizations reported that federal prosecutors are weighing whether to bring charges against members of WikiLeaks, possibly including conspiracy, theft of government property and violating the Espionage Act. &gt;All this speech to stifle speech comes in reaction to the first publication in the start of WikiLeaks Vault 7 series. Vault 7 has begun publishing evidence of remarkable CIA incompetence and other shortcomings. This includes the agencys creation, at a cost of billions of taxpayer dollars, of an entire arsenal of cyber viruses and hacking programs  over which it promptly lost control and then tried to cover up the loss. These publications also revealed the CIAs efforts to infect the publics ubiquitous consumer products and automobiles with computer viruses. &gt;When the director of the CIA, an unelected public servant, publicly demonizes a publisher such as WikiLeaks as a fraud, coward and enemy, it puts all journalists on notice, or should. Pompeos next talking point, unsupported by fact, that WikiLeaks is a non-state hostile intelligence service, is a dagger aimed at Americans constitutional right to receive honest information about their government. This accusation mirrors attempts throughout history by bureaucrats seeking, and failing, to criminalize speech that reveals their own failings. &gt;President Theodore Roosevelt understood the danger of giving in to those foolish or traitorous persons who endeavor to make it a crime to tell the truth about the Administration when the Administration is guilty of incompetence or other shortcomings. Such endeavor is itself a crime against the nation, Roosevelt wrote. President Trump and his officials should heed that advice. &gt;Words matter, and I assume that Pompeo meant his when he said, Julian Assange has no First Amendment freedoms. Hes sitting in an embassy in London. Hes not a U.S. citizen. As a legal matter, this statement is simply false. It underscores just how dangerous it is for an unelected official whose agencys work is rooted in lying and misdirection to be the sole arbiter of the truth and the interpreter of the Constitution. &gt;Pompeo demonstrated a remarkable lack of irony when he suggested that WikiLeaks focus instead on the autocratic regimes in this world that actually suppress free speech and dissent  even as he called for a crackdown of such speech. In fact, Pompeo finds himself in the unsavory company of Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey (257,934 documents published by WikiLeaks); Bashar al-Assad of Syria (2.3 million documents); and the dictatorship in Saudi Arabia (122,609 documents), to name just a few who have tried and failed to censor WikiLeaks. &gt;Pompeo was once a WikiLeaks fan. On July 24, then partisan politician Pompeo gloatingly tweeted: Need further proof that the fix was in from Pres. Obama on down? BUSTED: 19,252 Emails from DNC Leaked by WikiLeaks. Pompeo liked WikiLeaks when he perceived it was publishing material revealing the shortcomings of his political rivals. It was only when our publications touched Pompeos rice bowl that WikiLeaks became his target. Pompeo subsequently deleted the tweet, but he is learning that in the digital age, the truth is hard to hide. You dont get to love the truth one day and seek its suppression and the incarceration of its publisher the next. &gt;As a candidate, Trump tweeted: Very little pick-up by dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks. The president mentioned WikiLeaks 164 times during the last month of the election and gushed: I love WikiLeaks. &gt;All democratic governments are managed by imperfect human beings. And autocracies are much worse  the benign dictator is a myth. These human beings, democratic and autocratic alike, make mistakes and commit crimes, and often serve themselves rather than their countries. They are the focus of WikiLeaks publications. &gt;The Pompeo doctrine articulated in his speech ensnares all serious news and investigative human rights organizations, from ProPublica to Amnesty International to Human Rights Watch. The logic that WikiLeaks, or these organizations, are somehow intelligence agencies would be as absurd as the suggestion that the CIA is a media outlet. Both journalists and intelligence agencies cultivate and protect sources, collect information and write reports, but the similarities end there. The world cannot afford, and the Constitution does not permit, a muzzle placed on the work that transparency organizations do to inform the American and global public. &gt;Fundamental issues of free speech and freedom of the press, and of the interplay between liberty and security, date to the Republics founding. Those who believe in persecution and suppression of the truth to achieve their parochial ends are inevitably forgotten by history. In a fair fight, as John Milton observed, the truth always wins."

In the nearly 16 years since the event, the 9/11 truth movement has evolved into four main camps with regards to the mechanism of the murder weapon. Broadly speaking, these camps can be qualified as follows: a) Standard controlled demolition; b) So-called ""nano-thermite""; c) Mini-nukes or other unconventional nuclear weaponry; d) Exotic or ""Directed Energy"" weaponry. There's a reason why the debate is so heated, for not only was 9/11 a horrific crime, but establishing the mechanism of the murder weapon is a huge clue. The question of ""who did it"" is inextricably linked to the questions of ""what happened?"" and ""how was it done?"" Can the various hypotheses of the mechanisms of their collapse be harmonized? Were the same parties involved in the use of these mechanisms? Or do different mechanisms signal the involvement of different groups, perhaps in conflict? Stepping back for a moment, it's important to consider the many striking parallels between 9/11 and the Kennedy assassination: 1. They were both used to remake American foreign and domestic policy, especially the normalization of war 2. They involved clear examples of ""security stripping"" (which on 9/11 extended to the entire country) 3. Both events were analyzed by independent investigators who uncovered a vast architecture of conspiracy involving many factional interests, each with the means, motive and opportunity 4. Both have indications of successful coup d'tats 5. Suspicious financial activity surrounded them, especially on 9/11, indicating prior knowledge 6. They each involve ominous connections to a sort of nebulous post-war ""Fascist International"" 7. The events are surrounded with occult symbolic content, suggesting they were rituals and vast social engineering works Not only is the MO of the perpetrators essentially the same, the organizational structures behind both are the same, indicating that the ""latter event was the logical end of the former."" In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, the more prevalent theory that was being formulated was the ""let it happen on purpose"" (LIHOP) hypothesis. The idea was that the US government knew of the operation in advance, then used it to project military power into the Middle East and enact draconian legislation. Over time, increasing evidence led to the rise of another theory, the ""made it happen on purpose"" (MIHOP) hypothesis. This theory held that at the *first* level of the op were the terrorists, who were simply patsies used by a *second* level, which could potentially involve rogue elements within the American military and intelligence agencies. For example, numerous military drills were taking place on 9/11 that involved hijacked airliners being used for attacks on American targets. To say this unfortunate timing led to increased confusion on that day is a vast understatement, and proponents of the MIHOP hypothesis note that the probability that the terrorists planned it that way was vanishingly small without *some* connection to a rogue network in the American national security structure. Many contenders have been suggested for this rogue network, notably the Project for a New American Century, which had determined that a ""new Pearl Harbor"" (a term later used by George W. Bush) would be needed to galvanize public opinion for a prolonged presence in the Middle East. The Late Michael Ruppert viewed 9/11 as ""the most significant event in human history: the end of the age of oil"", and many researchers agree that oil was a significant geopolitical motivation behind the attack. Author Laurent Guyenot takes it further by suggesting that 9/11 was about more than just oil and terrorism, it was a pretext for the American militarization of the planet. David Ray Griffin notes the dramatic change in Presidential rhetoric after the attack: it had become a metaphysical conflict that was ""a monumental struggle of Good versus Evil."" Peter Levenda argues that 9/11 functions as the sanctioning event for state sponsored paranoia: >The citizens are not allowed to become paranoid unless it is at government direction and sanction. Individual cases of paranoia are frowned upon. The state tells us that if we are not paranoid the way it is paranoid--and about the same things--it's because we don't have all the facts...the logical conclusion of all this paranoia is suspicion of the state apparatus itself. For Levenda and other researchers like S.K. Bain, 9/11 was [a ceremonial magical ritual sacrifice of massive scale](URL and can be viewed as a grimoire for magical operations. In between the extremes of these interpretations--9/11 for oil and 9/11 as ritual magical cosmological struggle of good vs. evil--the attack was also was a financial crime of high order. E.P. Heidner suggests that 9/11 was meant to cover up a vast fraudulent financial system. When taken at face value, these theories imply 9/11 was more than a terrorist false-flag op. It was a *multi-layered* op which accomplished several objectives at once by those with detailed inside financial, political and occult knowledge. **The Third Level** Webster Griffin Tarpely was among the first to suggest that a possible *third* layer was involved that day, beyond the ""rogue element"" of the LIHOP and MIHOP scenarios. For Tarpley, the MIHOP hypothesis ""represents the analytical point of view which sees the events of 9/11 as a deliberate provocation manufactured by an outlaw network of high officials infesting the military and security apparatus of the US and Great Britain, a network ultimately dominated by Wall Street and City of London financiers."" Although a natural development of the 9/11 Truth movement, after a few years the LIHOP hypothesis became increasingly at war with masses of evidence, as it simply couldn't address the absence of air defense for one hour and forty-five minutes, nor the incredible destruction of the towers. Even the Bush-Cheney MIHOP position is mostly untenable, as although they may have had limited knowledge or even a planning role, they likely weren't involved at the top of even level two. Tarpley and others believe 9/11 was a coup d'tat, a false flag event of state-sponsored synthetic terror designed to unleash the clash of civilizations: >The goal was to shock the entire US political system and the public in general out of their inertia of normal everyday life into a kind of war psychosis and paranoid obsession with phantom threats agreeable to the outlook of the neocon faction. Joseph P. Farrell speculates that this third layer is entirely fascist, and international in scope. The well-documented connection of various intelligence agencies (ie the CIA, KGB, GRU) to international criminal undergrounds and their trafficking networks allows agencies a significant source of income free from oversight for covert ops and black projects, and it also provides them with a means of monitoring those criminal organizations and in turn providing them with an independent internationally-extensive source of intelligence. IOW, post-WII, the Fascist and Nazi elites were connected with these underground criminal organizations, and liaised with the similarly-minded rogue elements within various nations' deep states. This certainly included the American financial and business interests that shared the same basic Fascist ideology. >For both parties, this was a post-war marriage of convenience, and from that point of view, 9/11 may have been the announcement of a divorce. The detailed planning of 9/11 had to have come at some point from within the American national security and military structure (level 2). Tarpley highlights the significant number of wargaming exercises and drills occurring that day and how the cover of these drills provided confusion in the command and control structure. Global Guardian was one such drill that involved all of America's strategic nuclear and thermonuclear arsenal: ICBMs, SLBMs, nuclear bombers, and the ""Doomsday/Night Watch/Looking Glass flying command posts."" It also involved airbases that house hydrogen bombs, including Barksdale in Louisiana and Offut in Omaha, Nebraska. As it happens, President Bush flew to *both* bases on 9/11 after leaving Florida. Tarpley notes that on 9/11 at Offut were some interesting characters, including Warren Buffet and General Brent Scowcroft...a potential ""Committee of Public Safety"". This group converged at the command HQ of US strategic nuclear forces as a potential element of a coup-d'tat, necessitating that Bush be personally present to reassert control over America's nuclear forces: >Thus, on the morning of 9/11, before a single hijacking had been reported, the US had assumed a strategic nuclear posture comparable to that observed during the Cuban missile crisis: B-1 and B-52 bombers were in the air; ballistic missile submarines were at their launch points, presumably near Russia and possibly China, and land-based ICBMs were ready for launch. >The air defenses of North America were also on high alert, both in terms of interceptor aircraft and space assets. Everything, in short, was ready for a nuclear first strike like the neocons have talked so much about in recent years. All of this was observed in real time from Moscow by General Leonid Ivashov and his colleagues of the Russian General Staff. >It is highly significant that Bush's 9/11 flight itinerary included both Barksdale and Offut, two US nuclear command centers which were part of Global Guardian. Global Guardian was a massive exercise in nuclear blackmail. But how does this constitute a coup d'tat? And why would Bush need to have reasserted control over the nuclear command structure by his personal presence at Barksdale and Offut? Tarpley also describes how the Global Guardian Computer Network Attack exercise that occurred on 9/11 was designed to simulate a cyber attack on STRATCOM's computer network command control structure by using denial of service attacks and other means. >A bad insider could easily have flipped the drill to ""live"" status by being a plant or mole for ""some other organization"" and thus missiles might actually have been launched. Here was the invisible government's back door to worldwide thermonuclear escalation, if that had been necessary, on 9/11. This suggests a three-tiered op, with the deepest layer penetrating the second, and threatening it with blackmail by compromising the command and control structure. For Tarpley, 9/11 was a coup d'tat with Global Guardian as its effective instrument of cover, a surrender of the Bush White House to the coup planners that: >...owed much to the fear that the coup faction were extremists capable of unleashing nuclear war. Here is a portal through which the rogue network could have launched nuclear missiles without the help of Bush. The targets for such missiles could have been Arab or Islamic capitals, if Bush had refused to initiate the war of civilizations in conventional form by attacking Afghanistan. The target could also have been China or Russia. >We must never lose sight of the Bush-Putin telephone call on 9/11, which was the central diplomatic and strategic event of the day, even though most 9/11 books do not even mention it. In that telephone call, Bush in effect delivered an ultimatum that the US was determined to seize Afghanistan...plus bases in former Soviet central Asia. Tarpley thinks Putin agreed, partly because he knew the US would fail in Afghanistan, and that such a large effort would ultimately sap America's strength. Bush's own statements, as well as statements from his staff, further suggested a coup attempt by level three against level two on 9/11. On September 12 and 13, Bush's press secretary, Ari Fleischer, indicated that the Secret Service had received credible threats on 9/11 from the attackers, and indicated that the White House and Air Force One were also targets. The New York Times reported them as credible because they had been accompanied by the use of transmission and identification codes unique to the presidency itself. According to researcher Thierry Meyssan: >The attackers also had the codes of the DEA, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), Air Force Intelligence (AFI), Army Intelligence (AI), Naval Intelligence (NI), the Marine Corps Intelligence (MCI) and the intelligence services of the State Department and the Department of Energy. >Each of those codes is known by only a very small group of officials. No one is authorized to possess several of them. Also, to accept that the attackers were in possession of them supposes either that there exists a method of cracking the codes, or that moles have infiltrated each of these intelligence bodies. >Technically, it appears to be possible to reconstitute the codes of the American agencies by means of the software, PROMIS, that served to create them. Farrell expands on this narrative: >It is crucial to note (and to remember) that some of the codes the attackers allegedly knew were those of the super-secret National Reconnaissance Office, the center coordinating all of America's spy satellites, and the center coordinating their reconnaissance data. To Meyssan, the use of the codes to establish the attacker's credibility and capability meant that the American state, and more importantly, the highest and deepest levels of its national security and military establishment, was penetrated by traitors and moles. By calling the White House they were blackmailing the US government, and access to those codes could help them usurp the authority of the POTUS, and conceivably flip the Global Guardian drill to live status. >The only means allowing Bush to retain control of the military was to *physically* hold the HQ of the US Strategic Command, at Offut, and to personally issue orders and counter-orders from there. After reading My Pet Goat in Sarasota, Florida, Bush made this statement: ""This is a difficult moment for America. I, unfortunately, will be going back to Washington after my remarks...two airplanes have crashed into the WTC in an apparent terrorist attack on our country."" Tarpley observes that the crucial remark is the reference to an ""apparent"" terrorist attack. Also of note is that Bush explicitly stated he would be returning to Washington after his remarks. At some point after this statement, the threat became clearer and he was diverted to Barksdale and then Offut. The Secret Service learned of a threat against Air Force One after leaving the school, suggesting the use of classified presidential codes to convey this threat. Then, at around 9:42 AM, ABC broadcast ""live images of a fire that had broken out in the White House annex, the Old Executive Office Building, home to a number of key offices of the executive, including that of the VP."" According to Meyssan, ""no information has ever leaked out concerning the origin of the blaze, or its exact scale"" as ABC had merely showed ""a fixed shot of plumes of black smoke escaping the building."" Approximately 15 minutes later, Cheney was taken by the Secret Service and escorted to the White House situation room, while sharpshooters ""armed with rocket launchers"" were deployed around the now evacuated White House complex. According to Meyssan, these troops were ""capable of repelling an assault by airborne troops. In short, they were facing a threat of a very different nature to that later described by Vice President Cheney."" Farrell extrapolates further: ""At that moment, the threat was not terrorism; it was something else entirely."" When Air Force One landed at Barksdale, Bush made another statement before proceeding to Offut. In addition to attempting to reassure the American people, Bush notably stated: >We have taken the necessary security precautions to continue the functions of your government...The resolve of our great nation is being tested. But make no mistake: we will show the world that we will pass this test. God bless. Meyssan, Tarpley and Farrell all agree that it's very notable that ""there is not a single mention of terrorism in this speech, but only of a ""test,"" and Bush's words could therefore just as easily refer to an internal revolt, coup, or military conflict, as to terrorism. Similarly, a terror threat, no matter how big or dire, is unlikely to provoke the statement that indicates Continuity of Government operations were begun."" Meyssan continues: >In such a context, one can interpret in two different ways the activation of the Continuity of Government (CoG) procedure. The simplest explanation is to consider the need to protect the President and other political leaders from the actions of traitors capable of starting a fire in the Old Executive Building and stealing the secret codes of both the Presidency and the intelligence agencies. One might also consider whether, on the contrary, the CoG plan was put into effect not to protect political leaders from traitors, but was initiated by the traitors themselves to isolate those leaders. >The account given by Vice President Dick Cheney is truly strange. He claims that men from the Secret Service seized him in his office and bundled him into the White House bunker without receiving his consent. He appeared to suggest that the same was true for the principal members of the government and Congress. And what else is an operation where the secret services take elected officials and put them in bunkers ""for their own security"", if not a coup d'tat, or at least a palace coup? Farrell speculates that the government in Washington had been seized by the coup, placing its key members under ""protection,"" leaving the President to attempt to reassert control over the strategic command structure of the military by his personal presence at its headquarters, forestalling a potential nuclear conflict, by surrendering to the demands of the attacks. In the scenario where Bush and Cheney and other elements of the government knew about 9/11, and even helped plan aspects of it, the third level now starts to reveal itself, for ""Bush and the federal government are then reacting to an operation they know has gone wrong, and that has been penetrated or coopted by someone else."" A few months later, Bush possibly alluded to these others ""players"" in his famous ""axis of evil"" State of the Union address. The fascist connotations of that phrase should not be overlooked. Another example of this rhetoric, noted by researcher Daniel Hopsicker, was when British PM Tony Blair referred to Al Qaeda as a ""terrorist organization with ties to a global network."" >That made sense. The idea that Mohamed Atta and his henchmen needed help from an international organization while they were in the US was easy to understand. But what *kind* of global network. Blair didn't say. Blair's ""global network"" remained elusive, unnamed, shadowy, and undefined. Several weeks later the FBI denied that this global network existed, and proposed instead a ""lone Cadre Theory"" which became the operative assumption in their investigation. Farrell, who has extensively researched the ""Fascist International"" and the assimilation of the post-war Nazi and Fascist ideologies into the Western intelligence apparatus, and who also believes that some form of exotic energy was used to destroy the towers, wrote the following in a 2008 letter to researcher Richard Hoagland: >So we are left with some version of the Nazi International extra-territorial state with an all but proven track record of the postwar investigation of precisely the technologies to bring down the Towers. This rationalizes the rather odd signs of ""panic"" that ""our"" elite has shown since 9/11, for consider the almost frenzied rush into Afghanistan and Iraq (whose ultimate purpose involved much more than oil). >Realizing that they were faced with an extra-territorial state with possession of extraordinarily sophisticated ""scalar-torsion"" technology that had been successfully weaponized, they launched a 'war on terror' with radical Islam as the fall guy, when in fact, the real target is something completely different and much more frightening. >The behavior of the financial elite during the bailout crisis is another signal that someone has the gun to their heads; they acted like people being blackmailed by some hidden ""protection racket"" by insisting on ""no oversight"" back in 2008. The only people in the historical record that wielded such financial and technological clout that I can think of were the postwar Nazis. Farrell highlights the strange similarities between this perceived reality and the James Bond film ""You Only Live Twice,"" which shouldn't be dismissed entirely as fiction as it's a fairly prevalent theory that Ian Fleming was ""leaking"" information under the guise of fiction. In that film, we find: 1. An international conspiracy that is extra-territorial, called SPECTRE 2. A network with a secret space program which it uses to interfere with Russian and American space launches and to bring the two nations to the brink of war 3. A society with a heavy presence of Japanese criminal underground 4. The society is headed by an obviously German fellow (played by an actor who Farrell notes is ""almost Martin Bormann-esque in appearance"") Farrell continues: >So my ""op within an op within an op"" scenario is basically that someone, with probably access to hidden space technologies, and with all but certain access to weaponized versions of ""scalar-torsion technologies,"" brought the Twin Towers down. >That ""someone"" is some sort of rogue extra-territorial organization, with deep and historical connections to the radical Islamic underworld. The message was sent: ""we know your game...we can literally turn your centers and instrumentalities of power to dust before your very eyes. We are deeply penetrated into your own covert agencies and plans, and the game is now afoot."" >Consider also the Masonic symbolism of what was struck in that way: the Twin Towers, the twin Masonic pillars of Jachin and Boaz, sitting in the heart of the Anglo-American elite's financial district...The Muslims do not have access to such technologies, whereas the Nazis were investigating them with a vengeance since at least 1933! This Fascist International had deep post-war ties with rogue elements of the similarly fascist mindset in the American financial and intelligence Deep State, a group initially represented by Allen and John Foster Dulles, John McCloy, and others of the ""Sullivan and Cromwell crowd."" Although many 9/11 researchers tend to dismiss or at least avoid these possibilities and discussions, others have no hesitation in describing Tony Blair's ""global network"" as a Fascist network, centered in London and New York. >It is therefore not a great leap of the imagination to state that this network also has centers in Frankfurt, and that some of its historical and technological roots lie in Nazism. This third layer exposes itself in a variety of clues, not the least of which are those clues which suggest exotic modalities of the Twin Towers' destruction, be that ""nano-thermite,"" ""mini-nukes,"" or exotic ""energy weapons."" >Viewed in this way, such an approach to 9/11 is an attempt to view the event from the perspective of Richard Dolan's idea of a ""breakaway civilization"" that secretly emerged over the decades since WWII, a civilization that emerged because of its decades' long access to secret funds, a great deal of which came from the exploitation of Axis loot, and that emerged because of its use of that vast war chest to fund the secret development of various exotic technologies. >Such an approach is not meant to delegitimize the efforts of those 9/11 researchers who stick to ""nuts and bolts"" and who do not consciously attempt to integrate their speculations about the architecture of the conspiracy into such a wide historical and interpretive context. >It is perhaps time to reconsider these clues within a much larger technological and historical context, for that context leads us to UFOs, to the black projects world, to the national security structure and Mr. Dolan's breakaway civilization hypothesis, and to that post-war extra-territorial Nazi organization, with its own deep ties to the criminal underworld, drug trafficking, and, of course, to Islamic radicalism and terrorism. >Like all Mafias, it has its factions, and like all Mafias, its alliances are always and only of convenience. It can does go to war with itself. Farrell and others have consistently argued that the goals of this post-war Fascist International was to destabilize Anglo-American petroleum interests in the Middle East, and that the war on terror might be a convenient front for a war against this Fascist International, ""connected as it was and is to Islamic terrorist groups."" It's time for the interpretive net to be cast much wider, as the Fascist devil is in the details.

And Why Wont the Media cover this Evidence-based Story?](URL I know a bunch of shills will tear me up screaming, ""ya got no proof,"" but indulge me in a conspiracy theory. I think the greatest disservice the MSM had managed to perpetuate is the fallacy that other than the obvious connection of all these people there is otherwise no connection between these events. Let's assume for the moment that the items described here are patterns of political belief and criminal activity. They aren't individual acts, but on going criminal conspiracies. Let's not look at this as an isolated event. While I'm detailing the actions of the Awan brothers. I believe, but can not prove, those action may have been perpetuated in concert with other individuals at work in the under belly of the government. It's almost as if disparate groups come in contact occasionally when their objectives overlap. As I stated, I have no proof of this, but it stands to reason the flood of cyber attacks and leaks may have overlapped through the individuals linked in the different events. For example, Debbie Wasserman Schultz was an integral player in the DNC Hacks and also introduced the Awan brothers to Congress. Is there a connection? Maybe, maybe not. It is not that far fetched, this has happened before, see the [Silverman group](URL Silverman associated with the [CPUSA](URL and knew [Jarretts father, Dr. James Bowman](URL and through [three degrees of separation](URL used by the NSA is directly connected to [Valerie Jerrett](URL If it is good enough for the IC to open an inquiry why can't we indulge in some similar speculation.  The First anomalous fact is the Media. Why have they largely ignored the issue. Before you cyber trolls jump on me, I would like you to consider two facts. Congress deals with very sensitive and classified material all the time. The Awan brothers could never have had a secret clearance for any other group than Congress. There is no news story there?  The Second error is the ""smoking gun."" The evidence is always covered up with a coincidence, a cover story if you will. While I believe the politicos in D.C. are pampered rubes, they do have a good support staff, and some have been trained to support clandestine operations. The rest have been hammered with political optics for the entirety of their career in D.C.. They are all trained to control optics and the dissemination of the truth.  The Third fallacy is the ""bad guy."" Why does everyone think an on going criminal conspiracy can be distilled down to a single criminal committing a crime rather than a pattern of criminal behavior with one or more groups profiting off the criminal activities. It is best to think of their actions like organized crime and should be prosecuted like a [RICO](URL case. An on going criminal enterprise by an organized group or groups of conspirators. ### The Media Why hasn't the media made this the top news story to at least go along with the Russian hack. Let's face it, the media doesn't care about the damage to the country, they only care about their partisan agenda. If they didn't they would cover stories damaging to the DNC. &gt;With a [$600,000,000 CIA contract](URL you would think the Washington Post could afford an investigative journalist or two. Perhaps CNN will take up an interest as this rabbit hole runs deep and wide. Don't hold your breath. Snowflakes and ""journalists"" can call Trump a fascist, but there is nothing connecting an enormous breach of the United States Security Apparatus by as many as 80 Democrat members of Congress (past and present). We rail on about the Russians and Trump without specific allegations backed up with evidence, but the media avoids providing nightly updates about these 5 spies that have compromised congress. The answer is simple, the Awan Brothers are Muslim and the ""victims""/dupes are Dems. Dupes who in fact abused their position of responsibility to end up being compromised by their own ""trusted"" staff. Several of the Congressmen involved in the breach have gone so far as to blame the allegations on [Islamophobia](URL &gt;Meeks said he was hesitant to believe the accusations against Alvi, Imran Awan and the three other staffers, saying their background as Muslim Americans, some with ties to Pakistan, could make them easy targets for false charges. This story damages the narrative that Muslims are benevolent members of the government and Dems care about the country. It really shows the depth of the progressive aims to ""[fundamentally transforming the United States of America](URL This is where the conspiracy theory comes in. Give me a little latitude to connect the dots, and let's see where this trail goes... #[An Alleged Muslim Spy Ring - Is This Why Rex Tillerson Cleaned House?](URL &gt;The mainstream media seemed far more interested in obfuscating the details regarding the Tillerson terminations than they were in covering what could be one of the most dangerous intelligence leaks in years, of which there has been but a peep out of any major news outlet. Captain Joseph R. John (Navy-Ret.) has stated that he believes the Muslim Brotherhood [fifth column has infiltrated U.S. Government](URL and if he is correct, the Awan brothers could very well be a part of this infiltration. The media is [90% Democrat](URL and I would argue that in recent years the mainline Dems have gone hard left, almost Marxist. They have an almost suicidal pact with Islamists. Where does this scandal connect with Middle Eastern Islamists? &gt;One might well look at the set of circumstances laid out above and see in it a scandal that would make Watergate look like a petty break-in. One might then scratch his or her head and wonder  why on earth would the New York Times or the Washington Post, which incidentally just hired John Podesta (speaking of horrendous cybersecurity!) as a columnist, have virtually no interest in the Awans at all? &gt;Do Carlos Slim and Jeff Bezos, one might ask, really believe they cant sell papers with such a story to tell? ###The Smoking Gun [EXCLUSIVE: House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs Committee Members Compromised By Rogue IT Staff](URL &gt;[Fox News](URL is told the employees made unauthorized access to the House computer system. &gt;Further, there were instances where House information was discovered in an external cloud server. The contractors in question reportedly were sending and storing House-related information in that off-site server. &gt;That violates House rules and it puts the House at risk, a source familiar with the investigation said. &gt;It is unclear whether the access issues exposed the Houses networks to potential hackers or spying efforts by unfriendly nations or terrorist groups, at a time when Washington is on high alert for such cyber-activity. Actually the last statement has been refuted. It has been alleged that Imran Awan had achieved a privilege escalation through [Social Engineering](URL Essentially Imran through the political clout of the Congressional leaders he worked for managed to convinced the Capitol Hill IT staff to escalate the Awans to super user privileges to work on the ""Congressional Machines"" in violation of accepted practices on the network. One device in particular was the Wasserman iPad compromised in the DNC Leak. It has been also alleged they may have had Podesta's password. Since the Dems approved the privilege escalation it is now forensically difficult to determine if the Russians leaked the emails or the ""enormously trustworthy and drunken"" Awan brothers sold access to the DNC servers. [House Hacking Suspects Could Read Every Email Dozens Of Congressmen Sent And Received](URL &gt;Imran Awan bullied central IT to bend the rules for him so there wouldnt be a paper trail about the unusually high permissions he was requesting. And their actions were not logged, so members have no way of knowing what information they may have taken, the central IT employee said. After obtaining access to the Capitol server system, the Awan brothers could control all aspects of a congressman system. They sold and configured the hardware setting permissions and remote access to maintain the devices remotely. Essentially the keys to the kingdom. Through congressional requests they managed to completely compromise the network. They could read email, transfer files, install applications (i.e. key loggers). The latter reports that the systems and network were completely compromised. Beyond that, Imran had bypassed IT key loggers and reporting systems by gaining remote access directly to congressional computers. [House Hacking Suspects Could Read Every Email Dozens Of Congressmen Sent And Received](URL &gt;The central IT staffer said any suggestion that the brothers access didnt span the full gamut of congressional intrigue was silly because they were the ones giving out permissions. The problem is that once they bypassed internal security there was no [logging of their actions](URL House authorities set their sights on the possibility that a remote server had been used to transfer files off of Congressional members computers. The investigation revealed that Imran had been [stealing money, equipment, and over charging for services](URL In total for almost 10 years and almost 80 Democrat members of Congress were compromised. This is where things go hinkey. Rather than turning the case over to the FBI the case is turned over to U.S.C. Police. They are investigating the theft, not the data breach. Let's state that again... ###The USCP are investigation the theft of Equipment not the Loss Of Congressional Data. [Congressional IT Staff Under Investigation In Alleged Procurement Scam](URL &gt;At the request of Members of Congress, the United States Capitol Police are investigating the actions of House IT support staff, Malecki said in a statement. ""No Members are being investigated. No arrests have been made. It should be noted that, administratively, House staff were asked to update their security settings as a best practice. We have no further comment on the ongoing investigation at this time."" ###The Bad Guy ###Two of the brothers, Imran and Jamal, have been linked to an emerging security breach The Awan brothers managed to get access to the Dems committee computers by just asking for the passwords. In addition the Awan brothers sold the congress outrageously priced equipment and broke into members of Congress' offices to steal equipment and or data. [House staffers under criminal investigation for alleged equipment theft](URL &gt;Five House employees are under criminal investigation amid allegations that they stole equipment from more than 20 member offices and accessed House IT systems without lawmakers' knowledge. &gt;More than 20 members were victimized by the alleged procurement scam and chiefs of staff for the lawmakers were briefed on the matter Thursday. &gt;The former staffer said Jamal was always there, but Imran would only work odd hours. And who is investigating this fiasco? &gt;Where is the FBI and why have they left it to the DC police? Is it a ""limited hangout"" they hope to bury by the promoting the administration's ties to Boris and Natasha? D.C.

The source said the FBI is not involved in the investigation. &gt;""At the request of members of Congress, the United States Capitol Police are investigating the actions of House IT support staff. No members are being investigated. No arrests have been made. Why aren't the FBI involved? I can only speculate, but it would mean that a FBI forensic team would have to comb through all of those congressional computers to determine the extent of the security compromise and data lost. The Dems just didn't seem up for the inconvenience of allowing the FBI investigation to go forward. The Awan Brothers had the keys to the kingdom. Physical security is paramount to cyber security. If a hacker has Physical access to a machine they own it. It is the simplest hack to conduct. The Anwar Bros had Debbie Wasserman Schultz's machine, along with Schultz, at least 80 other Dems also hired the [Awan Brothers](URL to provide IT support at significantly higher rates than normal IT support. &gt; Jamal, who public records suggest is only 22 years old and first began working in the House when he was 20, was paid nearly $160,000 a year, or three times the average House IT staff salary, according to InsideGov, which tracks congressional salaries. Abid was paid $161,000 and Imran $165,000. &gt;Democrats evidently [paid the Awan brothers over $4 MILLION dollars](URL Despite the fact that these individuals, reportedly heavily in debt, would have failed security clearances they were able to receive top salary from Dems including members of the intelligence panel and members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs were among the dozens of members who employed the suspects on a shared basis. The two committees deal with many of the nations most sensitive issues, information and documents, including those related to the war on terrorism. [Where's The Evidence? Hillary's Henchmen and the Awan Brothers Hack vs. MSM and Pelosi's Russia, Russia, Russia Meme](URL &gt;Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, who was shamed for the Democratic National Committee conspiracy against Bernie Sanders, recommended the Awan Brothers for their positions and Representative Jackie Speier asked for their [TOP SECRET CLEARANCE](URL [Whatever Happened with the Awan Brothers?](URL &gt;[frontpagemag](URL | Last year, eight members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence issued a demand that their staffers be granted access to top secret classified information. &gt;The [signatories to the letter](URL were Andre Carson, Luis Guiterez, Jim Himes, Terri Sewell, Jackie Speier, Mike Quigley, Eric Swalwell and Patrick Murphy. All the signatories were Democrats. Some had a history of attempting to undermine national security. Beyond the debt, the brothers seemed to have, they had convictions for felony traffic offenses including [DUI](URL Any one of these issues are enough to prevent or revoke a security clearance for normal folks. I guess things just work differently on Capitol Hill. The American military or college grads are denied clearances due similar issues in their record, but not these Pakistani brothers. Any one of these offenses would have caused me to fail my FBI background check at work, but congress can admit anybody. Do you see a problem here? [Valerie Jarrett](URL and [Huma Abedin](URL are perfect examples of the double standard in the government / Congress. Staffers of any background history can get clearances, but Dems seem to be able to prevent Trump's staff from getting clearance. What is going on here? [URL &gt;Multiple small businesses and individuals went unpaid as a result of the 2012 bankruptcy. Abid also had an unpaid line of credit of $10,000 with the congressional credit union at the time of bankruptcy. &gt;Abids record includes numerous driving- and alcohol-related legal problems, including driving with a suspended or revoked license, court records show. He was found guilty of drunk driving a month before he started at the House, and was arrested for public intoxication a month after his first day. with possibly opposing goals. A felon normally commits the felony tens of times, maybe hundreds of times before they get caught. How many times does a Coke head commit a felony buying coke before they get caught? If they ever get caught, how many years do they get away with the crimes before they draw the attention of the authorities. The FBI, Congress, whatever never find the full scope of criminal activity. They may just get enough evidence to convict of a crime, but they never convict for all the crimes committed. What is really becoming obvious is the Democrats have irresponsibly opened our congressional security oversight to Middle Eastern Factions. These 5 are just one group that were exposed. Hillary had Huma, Obama had Vallery. A sharia practicing terrorist that believes in female circumcision leading a woman's March to equality in the 21st century. There are so many examples that one has to be purposefully obtuse to ignore the contradictions. While the nay sayers claim you can not connect the dots it is obvious that the dots were there for all to see and could have been connected. I would say that the deviation from standard security practices was intentional, but Podesta's password was password123 or some such nonsense. Who knows, our leaders may really be that incompetent. They haven't even made it to the minimum expectations to be employed in corporate America. I really don't know what to make of two very different groups with nothing but vaguely similar beliefs in Marxist ideals working together. Many of the thoughts I have on the subject are almost too extreme to believe, but the evidence is almost unavoidable. None of it makes sense unless someone is lying about their objectives. ###A Continuing DCNF Investigative Group Series [House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs Committee Members Compromised By Rogue IT Staff](URL [Brothers Had Massive Debts, Years Of Suspicious Activity](URL [Secretly Took $100K In Iraqi Money](URL [Owed Money To Hezbollah-Connected Fugitive](URL [Received $4 Million From Dem Reps](URL [Allegedly Kept Stepmom In 'Captivity' To Access Offshore Cash](URL [Also Had Access To DNC Emails](URL [Could Read Every Email Dozens Of Congressmen Sent And Received](URL ###Capitol Police ill-equipped to investigate data theft [House Democrats fire two IT staffers amid criminal investigation](URL By HEATHER CAYGLE 03/01/17 01:21 PM EST &gt;Two House Democrats this week fired technology staffers linked to an [ongoing criminal investigation](URL more than a month after the couple in question was barred from House computer networks. &gt;Rep.

This was a spiteful pact 'against the american peoples freedoms exploiting a candidate for their past inadequacies! Yet, should we punish them for their one time digital intrusion)?!? Laughable- Welcome to election biased 2.0 Here we are to be expected to be forth right about punishing russia for hillarys criminal abuses of her positions in secretary of state. Did russia force mrs clinton to go against the ""constitutive"" guidelines manifested by our own government in the use of a scif and public server as she knowingly used this against their wishes to openly endorse and send classified materials to her adversaries? Did russia also force her to dispell information to the dnc to allow her an advantage in the election in terms of recieving information prior to other candidates? Did russia then go on to force mrs clinton to destroy the evidence that was subpoena'd and destroy key elements of 'evidence' against her party with a hammer? Did russia force the obama administration to surveil trump tower coercing them to share confidential information on a candidate to the opposing sects of government? Did russia use the materials to oust these regimes directly by introducing the full contents of the files into the public realm prior to the election; this / thus greatly shifting the balance of fairness. (not by their own accounts)?!? But by Simply outlining the very real crimes of the obama clinton regimes while they held these positions of power in government...? It greatly amazes me how this goldfish syndrome takes to the general public. For nearly 20 years we as citizens of this nation have greatly felt the pressures of our nations abuses in office. Anyone that thinks well ""things were not that bad"". Greatly fail to imagine what a 20 trillion dollar debt deficit actually means. Thats almost 50k debt per citizen in a mass payout- Yet all we have to show for it is systems that have been guised to help the infastructure of our current slave culture- homeless? thats a crime! Broke? Thats a crime? Don't you dare be in debt! Thats a crime too! The laughable part is how we gauge this reality. Trumps not doing nothing!!! Are you f'ing serious? Front page are you literally that delusional to not see the blatantly advertised articles parraded about by PR entities that are anti trump. Everyday on the front page its a new angle and attack to delimit the actual truth thats already manifested- You have all been robbed blatantly might I add for two decades. From civil liberties to personal information and produce- Trump didn't do that to you- This isnt a ""forgive all"", on 'trump'- but its about time you shut up and listened- Hrc refused to cooperate allowing the fbi to investigate the breech. Shed used crowd strike to assess the breach who in turn used reddit as a guise and guiding vehicle to fully conceal her crimes. This is the basis of the russian hacking narrative; thus beginning the russian interference charade- If putin had these files he had every right to publish them himself; wouldnt this be a much more formible method to fully interfere with the election as it stood: Putin simply releasing the informatiom via the reuters media channel with their full cooperation... Lets not foget that it was guccifer that admissed that hrc' had an 'illegal server in the first place'. (whom is a romanian self taught cpu user); He was able to undermind the greatest offices of our republics office; via known exploits that any user on this very forum could learn (practically overnight). This wasn't because it was an accomplishment attributed towards years of training in private networking and breaching militarian industrial systems It was because for years our offices devalued digital security in the first place- leaving itself vulnderable to apparently anyone with a laptop and basic googling experience of or in publically posted personal information- We deserved to be hacked; Because our secretary of state at that time did absolutely nothing to protect our nation from it- She took it upon herself to reject the standards which were in place which did not allow for this method of exploitation. Period- She put the entirety of our nations national security at risk over her being nothing more then uncooperative and lazy. Allowing her staff multiple ventures to which they took to place classified materials into the public servers memory stream in the first place- (with her full permission)... No wonder she didn't want a legal asset such as the fbi to investigate it. The only evidence they would have from an investigation it seems: is that she herself willfully broke the law, thus: allowing for the exploits to have occured in the first place. Lets not forget the crime of destroying 30k pieces of evidence. (Which very well was subpoena'd in a federal hearing). All the while openly abusing nsa policy by neglecting our classified materials handeling/ processing policies. So let me get this straight. A one time cyber intrusion of a public server is say what a class A. Felony? While the past administration is given amnesty for abusing multiple federal laws and avenues of service to its own republic in masse? Yet we're to assume it was that 'dirty putin' that was behind all this all along? Furthermore what good is it that russia didnt hack us and publicize the information forthright? At least in that extent we would have nothing more then 330 million informed citizens having had the ability to make an informed decision on and in these matters respectively. What I dont get is that if the whole thing can't be addressed to the public in terms of it dieectly impacting national security; then the **only reality** that leaves us with is that Clinton and Obama have in fact breached the **entirety** of national security policy- If you cant tell us what they did its very, very likely what they did was far beyond anything we as a nation shoud or **will** accept And or tolerate- Now let me get this straight- These people broke multiple laws openly to the standard that we as citizens **are in danger of simply knowing the degree of the crimes committed, because the crimes are that volatile to present day society**; Yet we are to stand by simply ""unamazed"" as the criminals are given **full amnesty to not only walk away from these positions in government** meanwhile fully endorsing their public images through the guise of PR entities and assets which are **actively being used to delimit the topics and crimes afoot** Boosting their public images and securing **their future legacys in government?** Thats justice?????? At this point as far as an investigation goes. Guccifer already admitted that he had breached the HRC server; Stating it was like""an open orchid"". (So there is your mystery hacker in full right). (by his own admissions)... If the fbi is to be given 0 Access to the server's (due to criminal collusion"". I see 0 reason to say anyone other than guccifer did this hack- Lets not forget the ""false flag"" attacks that he bared / attested being witness to, in his investigation that he'd also attested too; (which outlined crimes against the american people, By their own government). I mean high treason is, as high treason does- So lets just call it what it is then.... Which is treason at the highest level of occupation- against you and me or 'we the people'. It is really no wonder that the fbi isnt being given access to these servers in that extent alone. (when elements of isis are being slowly tracked back to usa government funding). Its no wonder they are digging up literally any and all information into the trump family, and their administrations active ties to russia- I mean anything, and any-one angle would be better then the truth getting to the people on what HRC is attempting to hide. (in these extents)- Personally if putin did the hack then he deserves a huge thankyou gift basket, filled brimmingly with usb drives and champagne for the real investigation of criminal ambiguity; (In which our past administration took part in). From human trafficing, illegal weapons running; to the destabilization of multiple nations abroad; let alone Treason against the american people- its the full bulk and meaning of these Caustic lies and corruption that should anger you... The list is impeccable- Yet you all want to bash trump as though his commenting that ""putin should have hacked us"" is an unwarranted un-american request, because our long over digested and once had cold war ties; are still somehow existent in our now linear / new age timeline in events; (which we are now actively living through)- Who ever hacked HRC's server (which she herself was not legally supposed to utilize) gets a 100% free and whopping big thank you letter from me! Between ejecting all parties complicit in the devaluing of national policy, combatting decades of criminal collusion and their criminal omissions; re-assessing our entire government network to oust all credible and now current threats to inspire a new generation of government; - i'd say that our new leadership representative @ donald trump has many, a many, of years to combat these elements- (in which we are falling too now). This isn't ""work as usual"". Its a whole new vector of expectancy from citizens; this 'patching up' some 'decades worth of collusion:; and to be honest its been needed ""Far longer then every element of wikileaks existence""- Had ""transparency been provided to usa citizens in forthright"" wikileaks business model wouldnt have been desired in the first place, now would it... So let me make myself clear- The PC generation led us to delimiting the importance of being uncooperative. This: ""call a terroist, a small time criminal"" lead to the very escalation of these agencies, agents, and agendas- Its not that its fake news or alternative facts. Its that its paid media using smoke and mirrors; (all existing and assisting very real and nefarious agendas); to walk about in present day, unchallenged and unabated- (giving them full power to assert their indifferences upon the world)- I just can't say that after 20 years of lax security measures, failed policies and political indefferences that a man thats been in office some 70 days is responsible for the entirety of corruption thats taken place over the last 20 years without end- So I place my full attention to the one trump statment that is actually impeachable- **Either man up and lock HRC up** as you so elegantly and plainly mentioned during your candidacy; or **kindly exit the building-** We're not going to take that promise as a response or a statment- Keep your word to us. Or regret it- I say if we're to challenge trump on anything its that he drains that swamp of the most corruptive 500 members of state, who've elected to put our 300+ million nations, residents 50k in debt. (while they all proffited hansomely off our own painstaking slavery and demise).... Maybe thats just me? What do you say reddit? Is the state of the last 20 years due to trump and russia? Are you actually mad at russia? Or are you insulted that for some 16-20 years+/- that ""Your media, and government"" has colluted and was used to attack your consciousness; thus allowing us to slip this far into embarresment in the first place- These acts: openly allowing- these criminals to 'remain in their positions of power'. 'Abusing them along the way throughout the entirety of that time'... Sorry, but to say that 'russia is an entity in bed with trump', and that, this it is somehow or someway meaningful; in extent to those admissions is laughable- (seems to me at least) a huge huge joke by comparison- Who of you seriously cares if we're friends with russia? As far as I can tell we used to have a shared space program, nuclear agenda, and general respect for eachothers sovereignty- It was only in these past 20 years, of failed leadership; and criminal enterprizes; ""that those relations seemed to have deteriorated"".. (funny right?)- (Those that started the fight seem to be the ones pushing against a newely ventured foundation)? Hmm. Nothing fishy there?!? Just so happens, that: They happen to be the same parties with their hands caught in the cookie jar at this time... Now. Heavily, heavily pushing the dont trust putin propaganda- You know who loses in a pro american / russian front?

The IT staffer position expanded to include more than 30 representatives, including work under congressional members who were members of top secret level congressional committees (DHS, Foreign affairs, Select intelligence committee). &gt;Although personal office computers are not supposed to be used for Intelligence Committee business or classified material, [accessing these computers](URL is a high priority for foreign intelligence services because of the information they could glean about the committees work from unclassified emails. Their is contested information that the Awan brothers did get access to sensitive and classified information. While the emails and internal correspondence would be considered sensitive, but I have yet to confirm classified information was compromised, however a lot of circumstantial evidence prevent me from ruling out the possibility. The brothers are suspected of serious violations including accessing members computer networks without their knowledge and stealing equipment from Congress, over billing congress for work and parts, transferring data to a remote server, and bypassing normal security protocols for IT staff. Their Democrat benefactors allowed the breech of policy for the sake of convenience.  The Awans operated an external server, which is against all protocols concerning secured government information. &gt;Further, there were instances where [House information was discovered in an external cloud server](URL The contractors in question reportedly were sending and storing House-related information in that off-site server.  The Awans had special access to the White House and for Visas.  Multiple Democratic lawmakers have yet to cut ties with House staffers under criminal investigation for wide-ranging equipment and data theft. ``Imran Awan, a longtime House staffer who worked for more than two dozen Democrats since 2004, is still employed by Rep. Debbie Wasserman (As of March 5, 2017) In my first [article](URL I glossed over the kidnapping of the ""stepmother"" not understanding the significance of the event. When I read the [Fairfax County Police report](URL it just didn't grab my attention. One fact I missed was the use of electronic surveillance to control the movements and actions of the stepmother. I also failed to understand the Awan brothers were trying to gain access to funds in Pakistan. &gt;Congressional staffers allegedly held their stepmother in captivity with violent threats in a plan to use her to access money stashed away in the Middle East. The staffers are suspected of using their positions to enrich themselves.  &gt;They kept their stepmother in sort of illegal captivity from October 16, 2016 to February 2, the relative said, telling her they were in charge of her life and said she was not allowed to speak to anyone. The fact that she did not speak English made it easy for them to take advantage of her.  &gt;The brothers bugged her house with hidden listening devices and told her her movements were under constant surveillance and conversations within the house and over the telephone were being listened to. They would repeat what she had told people to prove that they were really listening.  &gt;But as soon as Shah passed away, they came into the house and whatever documents were there they stole, a couple laptops which were their fathers property, and left for Pakistan. ###And left for Pakistan... ###This article proves a number of things that should be explored. ###The first would be the use of surveillance equipment on the stepmother. Yes, I will concede that they could have bought the equipment to watch their stepmother, but I believe that is unlikely. The skills to run a surveillance operation are beyond most IT techs. It's not that they couldn't figure it out, they just wouldn't have the equipment. While the price is dropping, running an effective bugging operation is expensive and time consuming. Let's consider for they moment the brothers had the equipment for other jobs and repurposed the equipment for their surveillance of the stepmother. This brings us to the first logical leap... How many of you have used an in-line key logger? It's a simple, inexpensive device that can't be detected by antivirus software. It operates outside of the OS plugged into the USB port then the keyboard is plugged into the logger. The only real problem is obtaining access to deploy and recover the device. This brings us to the break ins. Why did the Awan brothers break in to 20+ Congressional offices when they already had full admin and remote access to the computers. It has already been proven they could access/edit/delete all the Congressmen's email, files, everything. It is even possible to remotely format a system. They could even transfer data to a remote off site server. There was no reason to break in to the offices to recover data, so what were they after? I believe it was to recover something other than data. It only stands to reason they had to recover surveillance equipment and or Spyware installed in the offices and systems. They were running a bugging operation on congress and had to retrieve the equipment before they lost access to it. #The second is why did they run? Here is the second logical leap. They began controlling the movement of their stepmother on the 16th of October, 2016. No one at least in the Democrat party even entertained the possibility hillary would not be the next president. Even the pro Trump supporters had to admit he was a long shot until 9pm on election night. Almost everybody believed hillary would win and the bodies would stay buried forever. Imran was familiar with the clintons and it has been reported Imran was quite friendly with bill clinton. He was about to dramatically expand his sphere of influence. The Awan brothers had no obvious reason for consolidating their assets and running to Pakistan. They began their consolidation of assets some time before October 16th. This implies planning and fore thought. They knew something was coming. What could have been lucrative enough or dangerous enough to have caused the need to pack up shop and get out of town Was it the health of their father that caused the need to control the family assets? They were clearly attempting to get control of the father's, Muhammad Shah, assets and power of attorney here and later in Pakistan to ""inherit"" the family assets, but that would not have been cause to run. They could have acquired the assets and remained in the United States. It has already been shown they had enough clout to get past any problems the stepmother could have caused. That would not have required a break in to 20 congressional offices and a complete exodus of the United States. In view of the events we know that was an exaggerated response to events, or something else had to change. Was it the DNC hack? The wikileaks of email systems they protected? Was it the proposed changes to the security clearance for staffers that made them run? Could it have been the new policy of FBI background checks for staffers and the request for a Top Secret/Compartmentalized information request for investigation of staffers attached to the Congressional Intelligence Committee. Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and Rep. Jackie Speier recommended the Awan Brothers for their positions and asked for their [TOP SECRET (TS/SCI) CLEARANCE](URL This .pdf is a request for a budget addition of $125,000 to conduct background investigations for the highest level of top secret/compartmentalized information (TS/SCI) clearance for Intelligence committee staffers. This is speculation, but the Awan brothers were getting the brass ring. They had access to congressional data that would only increase with the clearance. This brings in an angle of the story I had found little published information on Nanoset Technologies, but what has been reported in r/TruthLeaks is the beginning of something solid on the Awan brothers web of business interests. ###Nanoset Technologies &gt;Nanoset Technologies were a government contractor that sells IT equipment to the government, but the Awans were officers in that company while they were staff, which is a conflict-of-interest {{ But it's also a way to get equipment with backdoors into the Congress }}  &gt;There is a well-known Bangladeshi doctor at the VA in Baltimore, MD [name redacted]. She was living with the Awans, and was doing business with the Awans--an odd mix of IT and Medicine. She became a CEO of Nanoset Technology while she was an MD at the VA, and the business listed is just a condo. How much biz did they do with the US Government? This would have been very lucrative for their business and open a whole new horizon of contacts and government pork they could bid on, why would the run? What would the investigation turn up? I have to admit I don't know the answer here, but it doesn't make sense. What I do know is we have not been provided a good reason for why they were planning their escape to Pakistan prior to October 16th, 2016. #The Security Clearance Prior to 2017 IT Staff could get access to Congressional computers systems with a simple FBI background check. Members of Congress could pencil whip this if they vouched for the staffer. [Do Members of Congress Have Security Clearances?](URL House and Senate staff members with a need to access classified information are required to obtain security clearances. The Office of Senate Security and Office of House Security, respectively, have oversight over the security clearance process for congressional staffers, and background investigations are conducted by the FBI. [Another Major Democratic Email Scandal the News Media is Ignoring](URL &gt;According to the [CIAs Center for the Study of Intelligence](URL There are no written rules, agreed to by both branches, governing what intelligence will be shared with the Hill or how it will be handled. The current system is entirely the product of experience, shaped by the needs and concerns of both branches over the last 20 years.  &gt;The House reportedly only required background investigations of House IT staff in 2016. These investigations were to be applied retroactively to existing House IT staff unless a member signed a waiver attesting to their trustworthiness and judgment. ###Is the FBI investigating this case? No, it was found to be in the Jurisdiction of the D.C. Capitol Police. As had been stated the U.S. Capitol Police are investigating the break ins of the congressional offices. Despite [Paul Ryan's](URL assurances, I wont speak to the nature of their investigation, but theyre getting the kind of technical assistance they need to do that, this is under an active criminal investigation"", How is D.C. Capitol Police the best investigative force to work the case? Are they actually better suited to investigate a Congressional Cyber Security Breach and track the suspects guilty of the Federal crime [18 U.S.C.  371Conspiracy to Defraud the United States](URL and, or apprehend the subjects in Pakistan? Despite media claims that no Classified material was compromised, if the information Idaho Republican [Rep. Raul Labrador](URL is correct when he said, ""This is pretty outrageous. These are people who had direct connections and access to the House, to intelligence information,... This is actually something that could directly affect the national security of the United States, and I have seen very little reporting, and apparently, the Democrats are not that interested. An argument could also be made that the Awan brothers violated [18 U.S. Code  793 - Gathering, transmitting or losing defense information](URL I'm not a lawyer, but it looks more and more like a federal case. If so, then why are D.C. Capitol Police investigating a crime that could have tremendous scope? So while [The FBI Is Building a National Watchlist That Gives Companies Real-Time Updates on Employees](URL for the rest of us, the word of a Congressional Representative who was also grandfathered a clearance just for getting in to the club can also recommend their staff for clearances. I understand elections have consequences, and our representatives need access to make informed legislative decisions, but through a funded campaign literally anyone can get a clearance. Like an enemy intelligence services wouldn't try to run for congress. At least a spy would have a better criminal record that many members of Congress. My point is the staff needs additional scrutiny and changes to staffing policy might need to be addressed. The staff doesn't need to be trusted by the representative, they need to be trusted by the country. In the corporate world, if the staff covers up crimes committed by the CEO they go to jail, but in Washington it seems to be a job requirement. ###Could a Foreign Intelligence Service be Involved? If so, Which One? Is it so hard to believe the very capable ISI could have sent in operatives to infiltrate the Congressional Intelligence committee. After breaking in to 20 congressional offices and leaving the United States under suspicious circumstances, is it absurd to consider a foreign intelligence agency might be attempting to compromise the House Intelligence Committee. We're building a circumstantial case but there is no meat on it. Where is the connection to the ISI, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Iranians? Where is the connection to any extremists? ###The following are informed guessing. I haven't found direct evidence to support this speculation, but have seen [circumstantial evidence](URL that points strongly towards ties to a larger group. I'm including this section primarily to elicit responses from you, the reader. I'm looking for direction and leads for the next article. Help me out and tell me what you think. [Another Major Democratic Email Scandal the News Media Is Ignoring](URL &gt;Were these IT staffers part of a plot by foreign actors to penetrate the House of Representatives and its computers? There has been speculation by some conservative journalists and experts that they may have had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. A former CIA officer told me she worries that the three Awad brothers, who reportedly are Pakistani immigrants, may have ties to the Pakistani intelligence service, ISI. While the political and faction associations are very fluid and complicated in the Middle East, it can be boiled down to [Shia and Sunni](URL interests in a very Broad sense. Iran and Syria are Shia while Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Pakistan are Sunni and they are fighting for control of the new Caliphate. [This is very broad and in its application difficult](URL but essentially true. This Why it is important to identify the players. Could the Awan brothers have been working for the ISI or Iran? This would also provide some insight to the motivation of the theft of data. Were the Awan brothers supplying information to Iranians during the nuclear talks? That would really define their motives, but we are left with more questions than answers. [Syria's Other Foreign Fighters: Iran's Afghan and Pakistani Mercenaries](URL &gt;A major reason for the disparity is that most accounts of the Afghan and Pakistani troops fighting under the Hezbollah flag in Syria mistakenly tend to minimize their ideological motivations. However, the Shia foreign fighter phenomenon could have serious ramifications for South Asia, because it serves as a pretense under which Tehran trains and indoctrinates militant Shia populations.  Enter Dr. Ali al-Attar, an Iraqi political figure who allegedly has connections to Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed terrorist group. While this is not an overt connection, but much like political corruption, individuals committing these types of crimes attempt to be careful. While many ultimately fail, they think through their moves and are harder to catch. Most complicated crimes, organized crime, financial crimes, computer crimes, are not discovered through direct evidence, but are uncovered through a [pattern of behavior](URL Remember they got Al Capone for tax evasion not boot legging or murder. &gt;Update: New concerns that this may have been an attempt by a foreign Jihadist organization to penetrate the House computer system arose this week in reports by The Daily Caller and The Daily Signal that the Awan brothers owed money to Dr. Ali al-Attar, an Iraqi political figure who allegedly has connections to Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed terrorist group. ###Who Is Ali A. Al-Attar, M.D The first thing that comes up is he was [suspended](URL Proxy Highlight) from practicing medicine - Maryland Board of Physicians charged Ali A. Al-Attar, M.D., a physician licensed to practice medicine in the State of Maryland. Dr . Al-Attar's failure to cooperate with the Board investigation was said to be deliberate by the board. Currently Dr. Ali al-Attar is wanted for tax evasion and defrauding [the medicare system](URL After losing his medical license in November of 2010 Al-Attar got to know the Awan brothers well enough to provide them an unsecured loan for $100,000. I'm sensing a relationship there. &gt;[Philip Giraldi](URL a former Central Intelligence Agency officer, wrote that Dr. Ali Al-Attar was observed in Beirut, Lebanon conversing with a Hezbollah official in 2012shortly after the loan was made. While Al-Attar was born in Iraq his parents were Iranian. At various times during the Bush administration, beginning in 2002, Al-Attar met with then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz along with a cadre of other Iraqi dissidents opposed to [Saddam Hussein](URL to discuss the war, Al-Attar has also been accused of helping provoke the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. Between 2002 and 2012 Al-Attar became disaffected with American actions in Iraq and began to formulate plans with Hezbollah. This would be reasonable considering his Iranian heritage. How does this bring Al-Attar and the Awan brothers together. This is another fact I glossed over not understanding the true significance of the brothers car dealership Cars International A, LLC, referred to as CIA in court documents. [How Radical Islam Penetrated The U.S. House of Representatives](URL &gt;And it is very interesting how the car dealerships finances were strangely interwoven with those of the U.S. House of Representatives. A car-dealing associate who was owed money by the brothers, Rao Abbas, also a Muslim, was placed on the congressional payroll. &gt;Abbas is listed as the IT professional for former Democratic Representative Patrick Murphy, a then-member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and its Subcommittee on Department of Defense, Intelligence and Overhead Architecture and (irony alert) Subcommittee on the NSA and Cybersecurity. Imran actually got Democratic Representative Patrick Murphy to place Rao Abbasi on his payroll. It is likely that Rao simply ran the dealership and got paid for being a part of the Awan crew. This seems like fraud to me. Isn't the FBI supposed to ask politicians about the misappropriation of funds? We'll come back to Rao in a moment. &gt;Imram later acted as [owner since CIA](URL was considered family business by the Awans, Abids one-time business partner, Nasir Khattak, said in court documents. The car dealerships finances consisted of byzantine transfers in which staff and cars were often swapped between it and a dealership next door, Khattak said. Lets look again at the car dealership, CIA (Cars International A). The records show a [confusing tangle of sales](URL and trades, but despite the 5 million the brothers took in from their work as congressional staffers, the brothers were constantly in debt. Imran brought in about 150 grand a year between himself and the 2 wives also brought in 6 figure salaries. Now we have Hezbollah-Connected Dr. Al-Attar putting cash in to the dealership after fleeing the country. At about the same time he is meeting with a Hezbollah leader, and Hezbollah gets busted for laundering drug money with used cars and consumer goods from China. The documentation for the business was in shambles and Imran maintained control of the dealers license. In essence, Imran was able to front for Hezbollah in their auto trading. Also while heavily in debt Imran was able to mass a portfolio of real estate properties. &gt;In addition to his other jobs, [Imran is a real estate agent](URL and Khattak is also a realtor who obtained the cash from Al-Attar and passed it through bank accounts used for real estate deals in Fairfax County, Va. &gt;Having lost my and Abids collective investment of $500k due to Awans mismanagement, [CIA] was further in debt $400k to other creditors, Khattak said in a lawsuit. While it is obvious Imran had some fairly sloppy business practices and was predatory to his partners he also was well suited to launder funds for Hezbollah. Imran had obtained the licenses necessary to support what had by this time become a model for moving money throughout the world. Several arrests have been made showing Hezbollah buys used American cars, ships them to Africa for sale or trade for drugs. At the same time Chinese consumer goods are being shipped to South America to trade for drugs in South America. Money is made from the transport and sale of drugs in to Europe from South America and Africa. The profits are then used to buy more vehicles in North America and consumer goods in China. The money is then laundered by banks like the Lebanese Canadian Bank with some of the money being siphoned off to pay for further terrorist activities. Beyond supporting their terrorist activities they also expand their allies and support in Africa, Central, and South America creating an international presence. It may be a coincidence that Imrans businesses model gots ideally in to the current standard fir money laundering by Hezbollah, but it is an amazing coincidence if it was accidental. ###[Hezbollah laundered money with used-car sales, U.S. says](URL &gt;NEW YORK (Bloomberg) -- Lebanese Canadian Bank and two Lebanese exchange houses helped launder more than $480 million for the Hezbollah terrorist group in a scheme that involved buying and selling used cars, the U.S. said in a civil complaint today. &gt;Federal prosecutors filed a lawsuit in Manhattan claiming the defendants took money from Lebanon to buy used cars in the U.S. and sell them in West Africa. Here is where I begin to speculate. Imran, at this point, has infiltrated or highest levels of security and at the very least has the ability to run the most compromising surveillance operation of the Democrat party, the Congress, the United States government and intelligence initiatives in history. The story of the break-ins makes the hillary server small potatoes. hillary may have opened foggy bottom to the world while she was sec state, but the Awan brothers gave congress to the Iranians, the Pakistanis, or given his predatory business practices, both of them. Then while Imran is compromising Congress he also builds a business that integrates perfectly in to Hezbollah's business model. What if Al-Attar was a fictional partner. The Keiser Sosei as it were for the business. Insane right? There is no way it's possible the business partner who hasn't been seen in the United States since 2010 didn't even exist right. The money trail is there. There are documents, loans, paperwork. Are you sure? [EXCLUSIVE: House Dem IT Guys In Security Probe Secretly Took $100K In Iraqi Money](URL &gt;Abid claimed the Iraqi doctor may never have existed. If as suspected, all of this is a charade, particularly if it is learned the mysterious Dr. Al-Attar doesnt exist or didnt sign the documents, then the whole matter rises to a higher level, he said in court documents. ###I want you to remember as quoted above... &gt;Abbas is listed as the IT professional for former Democratic Representative Patrick Murphy, a then-member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and its Subcommittee on Department of Defense, Intelligence and Overhead Architecture and (irony alert) Subcommittee on the NSA and Cybersecurity. &gt;By 2009, the family was simultaneously managing a full-time car dealership in Virginia, with Abid running day-to-day operations after contributing $250,000 in startup cash. It was called Cars International A, LLC, referred to as CIA in court documents. &gt;Imran boasted unusual clout among House Democrats, and was even pictured conversing with former President Bill Clinton. After Rao Abbas, who was owed money by the dealership, threatened to sue amid allegations of deception and theft, Abbas appeared on the congressional payroll and received $250,000 in taxpayer payments. ###And Debbie Wasserman Schultz refuses to fire Imran Awan. What's going on here? Imran is still on Debbie Wasserman Schultz's payroll as a [consultant](URL Wasn't Imran at IT consultant? His access to the House of Representatives and more importantly the House computer systems has been revoked. What exactly is Imran consulting on? I'm sorry I don't have answers for this one, but it definitely makes no sense. This anomaly is so strange it requires more investigation. #Where are we at so far? We have 4 brothers and 2 wives start doing work for congress. Imran gets a job with Rep Gregory Meeks. The next year he also getting Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Jackie Speers to put him on their payroll. From there he manages to work in his brothers and Rao Abbasi on to the congressional payroll for an, as of yet, unspecified number of Congressmen (Somewhere above 30) Imran is pulling down somewhere around $150,000 and the others are getting between $100,000 and $150,000 apiece. Three times the normal salary for other staffers. How ya feelin' about your tax dollars now? Most likely, the brothers ran a social engineering hack to bypass security protocols and compromised congressional data security. What does that mean? They asked for passwords and access to computer systems and networks, and their congressional clients handed them the access. Additionally they most likely ran a surveillance operation and compromised a number Congressional Representatives. The brothers also established the frame work for Hezbollah to launder money for various items including narcotics to fund world wide operations. Either they did support Hezbollah or stumbled on the perfect operation. Incidentally the operation is perfect for support for Iranian intelligence to follow the progress of the Iranian deal. Yes, I know Imran arrived in 2005, but these operations progress and evolve as opportunities present themselves. No one knew how [Valerie Jarrett](URL obama's senior advisor, was born in Iran and maintained ties to Iran and CPUSA. The presumed next administration, hillary, had [Huma Abidin](URL She has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, a Sunni group. Remember Iran, Shia, and the Saudis, Sunni, the Muslim Brotherhood are fighting for control of the Middle East. Now ask yourself why the Awan brothers were booking it to Iran before October 16th, 2016. This is supposition, but the pieces really look like they could fit. Especially if we have not entirely understood the nuances of the operation. This looks very similar to Russian operations exposed in the [Venona papers](URL and books like [Black Listed by History](URL by M. Stanton Evans. A great read if your in to true Capitol Hill intrigue. McCarthy wasn't the man you think he was. I bring this up because these operations are much like the Cold War Era KGB Ops. Funny how the Iranians cozy up to the Russians and an intelligence operation that had their fingerprints all over it resembles something the GRU or FSB would roll out. All of the facts in the piece are true and cited from news sources. Many of them were in several sources, however, a lot of the conclusions in this piece are suppositions, but they do fit together nicely. Each piece is supported and sets the foundation for the next piece. That is really what makes it work. I didn't know the answer when I started this piece.

I know that because my family works within cyber crime, and digital-forensics investigative communities. While I am uncertain that this is fully true: From what I was told as a child: Globalhell formed after a 16 year old american hacker was extradited to china for a digital intrusion. I believe it was a military server he struck at the time. For the lulz- From what I recall, the hacker was given a life sentence for his crime which is an important element of our story- This was the dawning of the internet far before sites like reddit or MySpace came along. Yahoo was big. Google didn't exist. It was the eris network eurkle and aol that were the key players at the time. People met on yahoo groups like y/ethicalhackers and y/programming- So, when news of the american hackers sentencing came to light. Sects of hackers from all over the world sought to bring him justice. Trojans were imbedded into masses of chinese machines. Websites defaced. These groups left backdoor exploits into Military, industrial, and public networks alike... It was said that the groups goal was to say: ""release the boy"" or ""we will turn china off.""- hence globalhell- It was only that in the middle of the planning and execution phases, that the groups intentions were discovered by white hatters; Leading to the arrests of many individuals. Thus ending what once was an amazing achievement in internet history. By a true group of digital warriors, and one's I grew up to see as patriots- I am the son of a white hatter- I grew up being taught by a detective and investigator. Thus envying the complexity of hackers and their ways. Their life stories, goals, and achievements impressed me. People like analyzer99, gary mckinnon, julian assange, kimdotcom, globalhell- these were my baseball teams... Its their art, dedication, and skills that made them masterful. Clever little cheeky cunts. The smarter they were; The more impressed I was... Last year during the election, when julian assanges internet connection was severed and his posts dissappeared, i'd felt devistated... like the world lost another hacker and kindred soul... To no better then the likes of hrc herself- That quite rightly set me off from the beginning... Say what you want about julians service yet its a needed one. Call it a grey area in which humanity needs at times. Much like any hacker would say. The world is full of exploits. There is always a whim and a way- So at that time due to my parents backgrounds and my childhood rearing, Id taken it upon myself to use this name in the honor of those that came before it... Primarily doing my best on subs like /whereisassange and /wikileaks. To do everything I could ""within the law"" to push for his identity and safety to be known. I just wanted to know he was safe... It was the similarities which tied to the original goals of globalhell that lead me to taking on the name- However... The election was another story altogether, and because my families ties and knowledge to the digital forensics communities. When the reports began surfacing of a potential russian / hack on the democtatic party. I'd again lost my anger exponetially. People talk... Of the near 2000 government and leo's working within the cyber crime communities (whom's networks and names I refuse to name) yet all that cordinate within my families social networks. Not a single one could verify a means for any party of our nation to ascertain a russian involvment with any level of certainty, based on the information at hand. While coming from a digital forensics investigator with over a decades experience. The bulk of the russian hacking reports are not consistent with any level of expectancy nor evidence to lead the statments in which our media has so carelessly made. ""Russia hacked us!""~ ""Then prove it!"" Give up your tainted illegal server to the fbi's vetted forensics department, and prove it!- Because as far as I myself can tell: There are over 2000 cyber security experts that call absolute bullshit on the russian hacking the hrc servers narrative. It's all based on the information provided by the crowd strike report- Who could even believe it with the ""handles' provided. Not to mention that crowd strike is already redacting statements to the reports. While ukraine has shown impossible connections to the story as it regards information inconsistent with the facts that crowd strike attempted to provide; regarding their own military equipment. There was so much collusion by the dnc during the election; That I began to fear for this nations security- So from then on I decided to stay globalhell and do my own sort of exploit- I don't black hat machines. Yet I know people and I decided enough was enough. (when it came to those people)... So I reached out to the trump administration in the first week of december 2016. Writing multiple accounts in the administrations such as the eric trump foundation, and trump foundation themselves- I saw a potential for an attack on his tower and newyork. The attack I assessed was well thought out and mentioned here in /r/conspiracy; I just felt and saw the weakness of the DNC and HRC campaign, and felt this looming ominous and sort of desperation growing on their ends. Making me question the works of ""guccifer"". If you haven't read his wikipedia page, I suggest you do! Because you would notice A. He admitted to hacking the HRC server and B. Stated he found evidence of a false flag nuclear attack on Boston. 'maybe thats why she wont give her server up for an investigation'??? (who knows)... So I wrote and I wrote and I wrote the trump family; and I begged his family to take a vacation (just incase, and for their safety). It just seemed relevant that an attack could have in fact been planned...I saw it as the dems failing the polls and their tricks running up. Considering the potential for a hail mary such as an event in the form of a potential device of mass destruction or bomb being delivered to the trump tower itself. Its even in my posting history- The real shocker (to me at least) came some two weeks later; when a suspiscious unattended package was found inside the trumps building, containing nothing more then childrens toys. (its rather suspiscious)... *the timing- I believe this was all the conclusion that trump needed to understand that the words I said to him and his family were relevant; - Not in the extent an attack was to occur yet to prove that one was simultaneously occuring; as someone, somewhere, was most certainly and obviously listening... That was one of the primary and partial intents of my posts. To protect the trump family whom I believe in. As well as guaging the criminal acts of a past administration. Which was potentially surveilling the trump family. As I conveyed my general thoughts in these messages that trump indeed was likely being watched- If you asked me, why I did what I did... I did it in the spirit of humanity- For me for you and for our futures... So was trump aware he was being spied on before then. I don't know- yet call me optimistic that after the series of events that took place: I think (in a way) he's absolutely known since the day his tower was evacuated... And Thats exactly why he's pissed about it... Because he was tipped off personally by myself afterall... I can prove I sent these emails. I just can't prove that anyones read them... Sigh... Yet I can say- Go fuck yourself obama- Yours truly- Globalhell- 14o3myeq1hjSEbbrLU67MACiWAZ7mtdK39"

While I am uncertain that this is fully true: From what I was told as a child: Globalhell formed after a 16 year old american hacker was extradited to china for a digital intrusion. I believe it was a military server he struck at the time. For the lulz- From what I recall, the hacker was given a life sentence for his crime which is an important element of our story- This was the dawning of the internet far before sites like reddit or MySpace came along. Yahoo was big. Google didn't exist. It was the eris network eurkle and aol that were the key players at the time. People met on yahoo groups like y/ethicalhackers and y/programming- So, when news of the american hackers sentencing came to light. Sects of hackers from all over the world sought to bring him justice. Trojans were imbedded into masses of chinese machines. Websites defaced. These groups left backdoor exploits into Military, industrial, and public networks alike... It was said that the groups goal was to say: ""release the boy"" or ""we will turn china off.""- hence globalhell- It was only that in the middle of the planning and execution phases, that the groups intentions were discovered by white hatters; Leading to the arrests of many individuals. Thus ending what once was an amazing achievement in internet history. By a true group of digital warriors, and one's I grew up to see as patriots- I am the son of a white hatter- I grew up being taught by a detective and investigator. Thus envying the complexity of hackers and their ways. Their life stories, goals, and achievements impressed me. People like analyzer99, gary mckinnon, julian assange, kimdotcom, globalhell- these were my baseball teams... Its their art, dedication, and skills that made them masterful. Clever little cheeky cunts. The smarter they were; The more impressed I was... Last year during the election, when julian assanges internet connection was severed and his posts dissappeared, i'd felt devistated... like the world lost another hacker and kindred soul... To no better then the likes of hrc herself- That quite rightly set me off from the beginning... Say what you want about julians service yet its a needed one. Call it a grey area in which humanity needs at times. Much like any hacker would say. The world is full of exploits. There is always a whim and a way- So at that time due to my parents backgrounds and my childhood rearing, Id taken it upon myself to use this name in the honor of those that came before it... Primarily doing my best on subs like /whereisassange and /wikileaks. To do everything I could ""within the law"" to push for his identity and safety to be known. I just wanted to know he was safe... It was the similarities which tied to the original goals of globalhell that lead me to taking on the name- However... The election was another story altogether, and because my families ties and knowledge to the digital forensics communities. When the reports began surfacing of a potential russian / hack on the democtatic party. I'd again lost my anger exponetially. People talk... Of the near 2000 government and leo's working within the cyber crime communities (whom's networks and names I refuse to name) yet all that cordinate within my families social networks. Not a single one could verify a means for any party of our nation to ascertain a russian involvment with any level of certainty, based on the information at hand. While coming from a digital forensics investigator with over a decades experience. The bulk of the russian hacking reports are not consistent with any level of expectancy nor evidence to lead the statments in which our media has so carelessly made. ""Russia hacked us!""~ ""Then prove it!"" Give up your tainted illegal server to the fbi's vetted forensics department, and prove it!- Because as far as I myself can tell: There are over 2000 cyber security experts that call absolute bullshit on the russian hacking the hrc servers narrative. It's all based on the information provided by the crowd strike report- Who could even believe it with the ""handles' provided. Not to mention that crowd strike is already redacting statements to the reports. While ukraine has shown impossible connections to the story as it regards information inconsistent with the facts that crowd strike attempted to provide; regarding their own military equipment. There was so much collusion by the dnc during the election; That I began to fear for this nations security- So from then on I decided to stay globalhell and do my own sort of exploit- I don't black hat machines. Yet I know people and I decided enough was enough. (when it came to those people)... So I reached out to the trump administration in the first week of december 2016. Writing multiple accounts in the administrations such as the eric trump foundation, and trump foundation themselves- I saw a potential for an attack on his tower and newyork. The attack I assessed was well thought out and mentioned here in /r/conspiracy; I just felt and saw the weakness of the DNC and HRC campaign, and felt this looming ominous and sort of desperation growing on their ends. Making me question the works of ""guccifer"". If you haven't read his wikipedia page, I suggest you do! Because you would notice A. He admitted to hacking the HRC server and B. Stated he found evidence of a false flag nuclear attack on Boston. 'maybe thats why she wont give her server up for an investigation'??? (who knows)... So I wrote and I wrote and I wrote the trump family; and I begged his family to take a vacation (just incase, and for their safety). It just seemed relevant that an attack could have in fact been planned...I saw it as the dems failing the polls and their tricks running up. Considering the potential for a hail mary such as an event in the form of a potential device of mass destruction or bomb being delivered to the trump tower itself. Its even in my posting history- The real shocker (to me at least) came some two weeks later; when a suspiscious unattended package was found inside the trumps building, containing nothing more then childrens toys. (its rather suspiscious)... *the timing- I believe this was all the conclusion that trump needed to understand that the words I said to him and his family were relevant; - Not in the extent an attack was to occur yet to prove that one was simultaneously occuring; as someone, somewhere, was most certainly and obviously listening... That was one of the primary and partial intents of my posts. To protect the trump family whom I believe in. As well as guaging the criminal acts of a past administration. Which was potentially surveilling the trump family. As I conveyed my general thoughts in these messages that trump indeed was likely being watched- If you asked me, why I did what I did... I did it in the spirit of humanity- For me for you and for our futures... So was trump aware he was being spied on before then. I don't know- yet call me optimistic that after the series of events that took place: I think (in a way) he's absolutely known since the day his tower was evacuated... And Thats exactly why he's pissed about it... Because he was tipped off personally by myself afterall... I can prove I sent these emails. I just can't prove that anyones read them... Yet I can say- Go fuck yourself obama- Yours truly- Globalhell- 14o3myeq1hjSEbbrLU67MACiWAZ7mtdK39"
48,cyber-crime,conspiracy,Vault 7 release info from actual files,30,5y0drf,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5y0drf/vault_7_release_info_from_actual_files/,2017-03-08 00:42:44,"sorry for the mess. copy paste.... Press Release Today, Tuesday 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks begins its new series of leaks on the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Code-named ""Vault 7"" by WikiLeaks, it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency. The first full part of the series, ""Year Zero"", comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election. Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized ""zero day"" exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive. ""Year Zero"" introduces the scope and direction of the CIA's global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of ""zero day"" weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple's iPhone, Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones. Since 2001 the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA found itself building not just its now infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force  its own substantial fleet of hackers. The agency's hacking division freed it from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA (its primary bureaucratic rival) in order to draw on the NSA's hacking capacities. By the end of 2016, the CIA's hacking division, which formally falls under the agency's Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI), had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other ""weaponized"" malware. Such is the scale of the CIA's undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook. The CIA had created, in effect, its ""own NSA"" with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified. In a statement to WikiLeaks the source details policy questions that they say urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the CIA's hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency. The source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons. Once a single cyber 'weapon' is 'loose' it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by rival states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike. Julian Assange, WikiLeaks editor stated that ""There is an extreme proliferation risk in the development of cyber 'weapons'. Comparisons can be drawn between the uncontrolled proliferation of such 'weapons', which results from the inability to contain them combined with their high market value, and the global arms trade. But the significance of ""Year Zero"" goes well beyond the choice between cyberwar and cyberpeace. The disclosure is also exceptional from a political, legal and forensic perspective."" Wikileaks has carefully reviewed the ""Year Zero"" disclosure and published substantive CIA documentation while avoiding the distribution of 'armed' cyberweapons until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA's program and how such 'weapons' should analyzed, disarmed and published. Wikileaks has also decided to redact and anonymise some identifying information in ""Year Zero"" for in depth analysis. These redactions include ten of thousands of CIA targets and attack machines throughout Latin America, Europe and the United States. While we are aware of the imperfect results of any approach chosen, we remain committed to our publishing model and note that the quantity of published pages in ""Vault 7"" part one (Year Zero) already eclipses the total number of pages published over the first three years of the Edward Snowden NSA leaks. Analysis CIA malware targets iPhone, Android, smart TVs CIA malware and hacking tools are built by EDG (Engineering Development Group), a software development group within CCI (Center for Cyber Intelligence), a department belonging to the CIA's DDI (Directorate for Digital Innovation). The DDI is one of the five major directorates of the CIA (see this organizational chart of the CIA for more details). The EDG is responsible for the development, testing and operational support of all backdoors, exploits, malicious payloads, trojans, viruses and any other kind of malware used by the CIA in its covert operations world-wide. The increasing sophistication of surveillance techniques has drawn comparisons with George Orwell's 1984, but ""Weeping Angel"", developed by the CIA's Embedded Devices Branch (EDB), which infests smart TVs, transforming them into covert microphones, is surely its most emblematic realization. The attack against Samsung smart TVs was developed in cooperation with the United Kingdom's MI5/BTSS. After infestation, Weeping Angel places the target TV in a 'Fake-Off' mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. In 'Fake-Off' mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server. As of October 2014 the CIA was also looking at infecting the vehicle control systems used by modern cars and trucks. The purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations. The CIA's Mobile Devices Branch (MDB) developed numerous attacks to remotely hack and control popular smart phones. Infected phones can be instructed to send the CIA the user's geolocation, audio and text communications as well as covertly activate the phone's camera and microphone. Despite iPhone's minority share (14.5%) of the global smart phone market in 2016, a specialized unit in the CIA's Mobile Development Branch produces malware to infest, control and exfiltrate data from iPhones and other Apple products running iOS, such as iPads. CIA's arsenal includes numerous local and remote ""zero days"" developed by CIA or obtained from GCHQ, NSA, FBI or purchased from cyber arms contractors such as Baitshop. The disproportionate focus on iOS may be explained by the popularity of the iPhone among social, political, diplomatic and business elites. A similar unit targets Google's Android which is used to run the majority of the world's smart phones (~85%) including Samsung, HTC and Sony. 1.15 billion Android powered phones were sold last year. ""Year Zero"" shows that as of 2016 the CIA had 24 ""weaponized"" Android ""zero days"" which it has developed itself and obtained from GCHQ, NSA and cyber arms contractors. These techniques permit the CIA to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Wiebo, Confide and Cloackman by hacking the ""smart"" phones that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied. CIA malware targets Windows, OSx, Linux, routers The CIA also runs a very substantial effort to infect and control Microsoft Windows users with its malware. This includes multiple local and remote weaponized ""zero days"", air gap jumping viruses such as ""Hammer Drill"" which infects software distributed on CD/DVDs, infectors for removable media such as USBs, systems to hide data in images or in covert disk areas ( ""Brutal Kangaroo"") and to keep its malware infestations going. Many of these infection efforts are pulled together by the CIA's Automated Implant Branch (AIB), which has developed several attack systems for automated infestation and control of CIA malware, such as ""Assassin"" and ""Medusa"". Attacks against Internet infrastructure and webservers are developed by the CIA's Network Devices Branch (NDB). The CIA has developed automated multi-platform malware attack and control systems covering Windows, Mac OS X, Solaris, Linux and more, such as EDB's ""HIVE"" and the related ""Cutthroat"" and ""Swindle"" tools, which are described in the examples section below. CIA 'hoarded' vulnerabilities (""zero days"") In the wake of Edward Snowden's leaks about the NSA, the U.S. technology industry secured a commitment from the Obama administration that the executive would disclose on an ongoing basis  rather than hoard  serious vulnerabilities, exploits, bugs or ""zero days"" to Apple, Google, Microsoft, and other US-based manufacturers. Serious vulnerabilities not disclosed to the manufacturers places huge swathes of the population and critical infrastructure at risk to foreign intelligence or cyber criminals who independently discover or hear rumors of the vulnerability. If the CIA can discover such vulnerabilities so can others. The U.S. government's commitment to the Vulnerabilities Equities Process came after significant lobbying by US technology companies, who risk losing their share of the global market over real and perceived hidden vulnerabilities. The government stated that it would disclose all pervasive vulnerabilities discovered after 2010 on an ongoing basis. ""Year Zero"" documents show that the CIA breached the Obama administration's commitments. Many of the vulnerabilities used in the CIA's cyber arsenal are pervasive and some may already have been found by rival intelligence agencies or cyber criminals. As an example, specific CIA malware revealed in ""Year Zero"" is able to penetrate, infest and control both the Android phone and iPhone software that runs or has run presidential Twitter accounts. The CIA attacks this software by using undisclosed security vulnerabilities (""zero days"") possessed by the CIA but if the CIA can hack these phones then so can everyone else who has obtained or discovered the vulnerability. As long as the CIA keeps these vulnerabilities concealed from Apple and Google (who make the phones) they will not be fixed, and the phones will remain hackable. The same vulnerabilities exist for the population at large, including the U.S. Cabinet, Congress, top CEOs, system administrators, security officers and engineers. By hiding these security flaws from manufacturers like Apple and Google the CIA ensures that it can hack everyone &amp;mdsh; at the expense of leaving everyone hackable. 'Cyberwar' programs are a serious proliferation risk Cyber 'weapons' are not possible to keep under effective control. While nuclear proliferation has been restrained by the enormous costs and visible infrastructure involved in assembling enough fissile material to produce a critical nuclear mass, cyber 'weapons', once developed, are very hard to retain. Cyber 'weapons' are in fact just computer programs which can be pirated like any other. Since they are entirely comprised of information they can be copied quickly with no marginal cost. Securing such 'weapons' is particularly difficult since the same people who develop and use them have the skills to exfiltrate copies without leaving traces  sometimes by using the very same 'weapons' against the organizations that contain them. There are substantial price incentives for government hackers and consultants to obtain copies since there is a global ""vulnerability market"" that will pay hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars for copies of such 'weapons'. Similarly, contractors and companies who obtain such 'weapons' sometimes use them for their own purposes, obtaining advantage over their competitors in selling 'hacking' services. Over the last three years the United States intelligence sector, which consists of government agencies such as the CIA and NSA and their contractors, such as Booze Allan Hamilton, has been subject to unprecedented series of data exfiltrations by its own workers. A number of intelligence community members not yet publicly named have been arrested or subject to federal criminal investigations in separate incidents. Most visibly, on February 8, 2017 a U.S. federal grand jury indicted Harold T. Martin III with 20 counts of mishandling classified information. The Department of Justice alleged that it seized some 50,000 gigabytes of information from Harold T. Martin III that he had obtained from classified programs at NSA and CIA, including the source code for numerous hacking tools. Once a single cyber 'weapon' is 'loose' it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by peer states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike. U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt is a covert CIA hacker base In addition to its operations in Langley, Virginia the CIA also uses the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt as a covert base for its hackers covering Europe, the Middle East and Africa. CIA hackers operating out of the Frankfurt consulate ( ""Center for Cyber Intelligence Europe"" or CCIE) are given diplomatic (""black"") passports and State Department cover. The instructions for incoming CIA hackers make Germany's counter-intelligence efforts appear inconsequential: ""Breeze through German Customs because you have your cover-for-action story down pat, and all they did was stamp your passport"" Your Cover Story (for this trip) Q: Why are you here? A: Supporting technical consultations at the Consulate. Two earlier WikiLeaks publications give further detail on CIA approaches to customs and secondary screening procedures. Once in Frankfurt CIA hackers can travel without further border checks to the 25 European countries that are part of the Shengen open border area  including France, Italy and Switzerland. A number of the CIA's electronic attack methods are designed for physical proximity. These attack methods are able to penetrate high security networks that are disconnected from the internet, such as police record database. In these cases, a CIA officer, agent or allied intelligence officer acting under instructions, physically infiltrates the targeted workplace. The attacker is provided with a USB containing malware developed for the CIA for this purpose, which is inserted into the targeted computer. The attacker then infects and exfiltrates data to removable media. For example, the CIA attack system Fine Dining, provides 24 decoy applications for CIA spies to use. To witnesses, the spy appears to be running a program showing videos (e.g VLC), presenting slides (Prezi), playing a computer game (Breakout2, 2048) or even running a fake virus scanner (Kaspersky, McAfee, Sophos). But while the decoy application is on the screen, the underlaying system is automatically infected and ransacked. How the CIA dramatically increased proliferation risks In what is surely one of the most astounding intelligence own goals in living memory, the CIA structured its classification regime such that for the most market valuable part of ""Vault 7""  the CIA's weaponized malware (implants + zero days), Listening Posts (LP), and Command and Control (C2) systems  the agency has little legal recourse. The CIA made these systems unclassified. Why the CIA chose to make its cyberarsenal unclassified reveals how concepts developed for military use do not easily crossover to the 'battlefield' of cyber 'war'. To attack its targets, the CIA usually requires that its implants communicate with their control programs over the internet. If CIA implants, Command &amp; Control and Listening Post software were classified, then CIA officers could be prosecuted or dismissed for violating rules that prohibit placing classified information onto the Internet. Consequently the CIA has secretly made most of its cyber spying/war code unclassified. The U.S. government is not able to assert copyright either, due to restrictions in the U.S. Constitution. This means that cyber 'arms' manufactures and computer hackers can freely ""pirate"" these 'weapons' if they are obtained. The CIA has primarily had to rely on obfuscation to protect its malware secrets. Conventional weapons such as missiles may be fired at the enemy (i.e into an unsecured area). Proximity to or impact with the target detonates the ordnance including its classified parts. Hence military personnel do not violate classification rules by firing ordnance with classified parts. Ordnance will likely explode. If it does not, that is not the operator's intent. Over the last decade U.S. hacking operations have been increasingly dressed up in military jargon to tap into Department of Defense funding streams. For instance, attempted ""malware injections"" (commercial jargon) or ""implant drops"" (NSA jargon) are being called ""fires"" as if a weapon was being fired. However the analogy is questionable. Unlike bullets, bombs or missiles, most CIA malware is designed to live for days or even years after it has reached its 'target'. CIA malware does not ""explode on impact"" but rather permanently infests its target. In order to infect target's device, copies of the malware must be placed on the target's devices, giving physical possession of the malware to the target. To exfiltrate data back to the CIA or to await further instructions the malware must communicate with CIA Command &amp; Control (C2) systems placed on internet connected servers. But such servers are typically not approved to hold classified information, so CIA command and control systems are also made unclassified. A successful 'attack' on a target's computer system is more like a series of complex stock maneuvers in a hostile take-over bid or the careful planting of rumors in order to gain control over an organization's leadership rather than the firing of a weapons system. If there is a military analogy to be made, the infestation of a target is perhaps akin to the execution of a whole series of military maneuvers against the target's territory including observation, infiltration, occupation and exploitation. Evading forensics and anti-virus A series of standards lay out CIA malware infestation patterns which are likely to assist forensic crime scene investigators as well as Apple, Microsoft, Google, Samsung, Nokia, Blackberry, Siemens and anti-virus companies attribute and defend against attacks. ""Tradecraft DO's and DON'Ts"" contains CIA rules on how its malware should be written to avoid fingerprints implicating the ""CIA, US government, or its witting partner companies"" in ""forensic review"". Similar secret standards cover the use of encryption to hide CIA hacker and malware communication (pdf), describing targets &amp; exfiltrated data (pdf) as well as executing payloads (pdf) and persisting (pdf) in the target's machines over time. CIA hackers developed successful attacks against most well known anti-virus programs. These are documented in AV defeats, Personal Security Products, Detecting and defeating PSPs and PSP/Debugger/RE Avoidance. For example, Comodo was defeated by CIA malware placing itself in the Window's ""Recycle Bin"". While Comodo 6.x has a ""Gaping Hole of DOOM"". CIA hackers discussed what the NSA's ""Equation Group"" hackers did wrong and how the CIA's malware makers could avoid similar exposure. Examples The CIA's Engineering Development Group (EDG) management system contains around 500 different projects (only some of which are documented by ""Year Zero"") each with their own sub-projects, malware and hacker tools. The majority of these projects relate to tools that are used for penetration, infestation (""implanting""), control, and exfiltration. Another branch of development focuses on the development and operation of Listening Posts (LP) and Command and Control (C2) systems used to communicate with and control CIA implants; special projects are used to target specific hardware from routers to smart TVs. Some example projects are described below, but see the table of contents for the full list of projects described by WikiLeaks' ""Year Zero"". UMBRAGE The CIA's hand crafted hacking techniques pose a problem for the agency. Each technique it has created forms a ""fingerprint"" that can be used by forensic investigators to attribute multiple different attacks to the same entity. This is analogous to finding the same distinctive knife wound on multiple separate murder victims. The unique wounding style creates suspicion that a single murderer is responsible. As soon one murder in the set is solved then the other murders also find likely attribution. The CIA's Remote Devices Branch's UMBRAGE group collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques 'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation. With UMBRAGE and related projects the CIA cannot only increase its total number of attack types but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the ""fingerprints"" of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from. UMBRAGE components cover keyloggers, password collection, webcam capture, data destruction, persistence, privilege escalation, stealth, anti-virus (PSP) avoidance and survey techniques. Fine Dining Fine Dining comes with a standardized questionnaire i.e menu that CIA case officers fill out. The questionnaire is used by the agency's OSB (Operational Support Branch) to transform the requests of case officers into technical requirements for hacking attacks (typically ""exfiltrating"" information from computer systems) for specific operations. The questionnaire allows the OSB to identify how to adapt existing tools for the operation, and communicate this to CIA malware configuration staff. The OSB functions as the interface between CIA operational staff and the relevant technical support staff. Among the list of possible targets of the collection are 'Asset', 'Liason Asset', 'System Administrator', 'Foreign Information Operations', 'Foreign Intelligence Agencies' and 'Foreign Government Entities'. Notably absent is any reference to extremists or transnational criminals. The 'Case Officer' is also asked to specify the environment of the target like the type of computer, operating system used, Internet connectivity and installed anti-virus utilities (PSPs) as well as a list of file types to be exfiltrated like Office documents, audio, video, images or custom file types. The 'menu' also asks for information if recurring access to the target is possible and how long unobserved access to the computer can be maintained. This information is used by the CIA's 'JQJIMPROVISE' software (see below) to configure a set of CIA malware suited to the specific needs of an operation. Improvise (JQJIMPROVISE) 'Improvise' is a toolset for configuration, post-processing, payload setup and execution vector selection for survey/exfiltration tools supporting all major operating systems like Windows (Bartender), MacOS (JukeBox) and Linux (DanceFloor). Its configuration utilities like Margarita allows the NOC (Network Operation Center) to customize tools based on requirements from 'Fine Dining' questionairies. HIVE HIVE is a multi-platform CIA malware suite and its associated control software. The project provides customizable implants for Windows, Solaris, MikroTik (used in internet routers) and Linux platforms and a Listening Post (LP)/Command and Control (C2) infrastructure to communicate with these implants. The implants are configured to communicate via HTTPS with the webserver of a cover domain; each operation utilizing these implants has a separate cover domain and the infrastructure can handle any number of cover domains. Each cover domain resolves to an IP address that is located at a commercial VPS (Virtual Private Server) provider. The public-facing server forwards all incoming traffic via a VPN to a 'Blot' server that handles actual connection requests from clients. It is setup for optional SSL client authentication: if a client sends a valid client certificate (only implants can do that), the connection is forwarded to the 'Honeycomb' toolserver that communicates with the implant; if a valid certificate is missing (which is the case if someone tries to open the cover domain website by accident), the traffic is forwarded to a cover server that delivers an unsuspicious looking website. The Honeycomb toolserver receives exfiltrated information from the implant; an operator can also task the implant to execute jobs on the target computer, so the toolserver acts as a C2 (command and control) server for the implant. Similar functionality (though limited to Windows) is provided by the RickBobby project. See the classified user and developer guides for HIVE. Frequently Asked Questions Why now? WikiLeaks published as soon as its verification and analysis were ready. In Febuary the Trump administration has issued an Executive Order calling for a ""Cyberwar"" review to be prepared within 30 days. While the review increases the timeliness and relevance of the publication it did not play a role in setting the publication date. Redactions Names, email addresses and external IP addresses have been redacted in the released pages (70,875 redactions in total) until further analysis is complete. Over-redaction: Some items may have been redacted that are not employees, contractors, targets or otherwise related to the agency, but are, for example, authors of documentation for otherwise public projects that are used by the agency. Identity vs. person: the redacted names are replaced by user IDs (numbers) to allow readers to assign multiple pages to a single author. Given the redaction process used a single person may be represented by more than one assigned identifier but no identifier refers to more than one real person. Archive attachments (zip, tar.gz, ...) are replaced with a PDF listing all the file names in the archive. As the archive content is assessed it may be made available; until then the archive is redacted. Attachments with other binary content are replaced by a hex dump of the content to prevent accidental invocation of binaries that may have been infected with weaponized CIA malware. As the content is assessed it may be made available; until then the content is redacted. The tens of thousands of routable IP addresses references (including more than 22 thousand within the United States) that correspond to possible targets, CIA covert listening post servers, intermediary and test systems, are redacted for further exclusive investigation. Binary files of non-public origin are only available as dumps to prevent accidental invocation of CIA malware infected binaries. Organizational Chart The organizational chart corresponds to the material published by WikiLeaks so far. Since the organizational structure of the CIA below the level of Directorates is not public, the placement of the EDG and its branches within the org chart of the agency is reconstructed from information contained in the documents released so far. It is intended to be used as a rough outline of the internal organization; please be aware that the reconstructed org chart is incomplete and that internal reorganizations occur frequently. Wiki pages ""Year Zero"" contains 7818 web pages with 943 attachments from the internal development groupware. The software used for this purpose is called Confluence, a proprietary software from Atlassian. Webpages in this system (like in Wikipedia) have a version history that can provide interesting insights on how a document evolved over time; the 7818 documents include these page histories for 1136 latest versions. The order of named pages within each level is determined by date (oldest first). Page content is not present if it was originally dynamically created by the Confluence software (as indicated on the re-constructed page). What time period is covered? The years 2013 to 2016. The sort order of the pages within each level is determined by date (oldest first). WikiLeaks has obtained the CIA's creation/last modification date for each page but these do not yet appear for technical reasons. Usually the date can be discerned or approximated from the content and the page order. If it is critical to know the exact time/date contact WikiLeaks. What is ""Vault 7"" ""Vault 7"" is a substantial collection of material about CIA activities obtained by WikiLeaks. When was each part of ""Vault 7"" obtained? Part one was obtained recently and covers through 2016. Details on the other parts will be available at the time of publication. Is each part of ""Vault 7"" from a different source? Details on the other parts will be available at the time of publication. What is the total size of ""Vault 7""? The series is the largest intelligence publication in history. How did WikiLeaks obtain each part of ""Vault 7""? Sources trust WikiLeaks to not reveal information that might help identify them. Isn't WikiLeaks worried that the CIA will act against its staff to stop the series? No. That would be certainly counter-productive. Has WikiLeaks already 'mined' all the best stories? No. WikiLeaks has intentionally not written up hundreds of impactful stories to encourage others to find them and so create expertise in the area for subsequent parts in the series. They're there.

It's not just about justice, it's about National Security and survival. We are otherwise enabling the coup. * The only way to operate a counterintelligence plan is simply releasing information, then the hidden network becomes available * *Classic obstruction means they are against you.* * Litmus tests: Will [Trump] send 200 agents to Haiti and the Caracol industrial park? If not, we have a coup * If James Comey releases all his old Marc Rich legal files without redactions, then that's a litmus test. If he doesn't, then we have a coup. * Let's look at the information that the Chinese hackers got. Let's publish what they took. Not the plans but the metadata. If he publishes, then that's a litmus test. * ***Trump needs to know about this DISRUPTion plan, PDD-62, otherwise it will be used against him*** * Disruption starts small and snowballs, gets on film, then on the media, etc. Trump needs to know about the Disruption campaign. * Publish the account numbers and the transfer amounts to HSBC. Another litmus test. If Al Copone has a bootlegging gang and you catch them you publish it, you don't protect them!! But these hidden donors are hiding al copones. --- * [[**Day 77 pt2**]](URL * Oil and mineral partnerships sold at the CFR with information from world bank conferences with infrastructure builders * Brown is a ***NOC - Non-official Covert Officer***, a CIA position, a completely fabricated life, a makeover.

If you see him shaking hands, start looking beneath the water for a secret pipeline&lt;&lt;&lt;LOL&gt;&gt;&gt; * KKR and Venado Oil and Gas Announce Eagle Ford Partnership: What's going on with this drilling under the gulf. Trump is smart to have Tillerson, because he knows about this. Question is now will Tillerson tell Trump?? * If Trump does an arctic deal with Russia then there's no leverage left for the middle east. * Trump needs to get the navy drones looking for the secret Haitian pipeline * ***The litmus test to know if FBI is on Trump's side is for the FBI to publish the 650k emails and the 1100 secret donors to the Clinton Foundation.

Mutation of Pax2 gene, Joest-Degen Bodies. A lot of these kids are turning up with this eye defect. The chances are 3-5 in 100,000. George believes the mutation is from a virus * Ernst Joest for whom Joes-Degen bodies are named, studied at Univeristy of Dresden, University of Leipzig; he of Malta, and the Pope and got [illegal] passports and [Nazi doctors were smuggled] all over the world to Argentina. And they set up these weird colonies where there's a lot of girls and one priest, and one priest impregnates all the girls. It's a kind of genetic experiment. * ***The film *The Colony* is about this--about how the Nazis were trying to create a new Germany in Argentina. How could we use viruses to kill off all the population and then have this new population resistant to the virus surface, type of sick thinking.*** * Yesterday when I said they Bombed Dresden and Pirna to [cover up] these weird types of experiments, and it wasn't for no reason there was a huge allied bombing. * The Nazi drug trials--they tried everything. These drug companies (IGFarben) worked directly with the Rockefeller foundation. Kaiser Wilhem instutute in Berlin--which was the center for eugenic thinking--was part built by at least half by the Rockefellers and also the Rothschilds * They were infecting people with viruses to see new strains of viruses and test the vaccines. Although these drug trials were horrible, they were a for-profit motive [and a national security motive] * ""Sonnestein Euthenasia Center. Pirna, Germany Set up by Karl Brandt"" * NAZI POSTER: ""60,000 deutsh mark to take care of one disabled person"" -- to guilt you into going along with eugenics; they say they didn't round up disabled people but....here's the poster. 70,000 people were killed in Sonnestein Euthenasia center. * I am wondering if the eye defect is a type of Nazi marker that can go on for generations. You can tell that grandchildren are yours by their defect. * Eugenics, ghoulish nighmare, dystopian vision of the world, that if they ever came out of the colonies they'd be able to identify all their children. * To add to intrigue here, supposedly at the centers, [children were] fathered by Hitler's inner circle. Kindergardens at Auchewitz, Dachau, Buchenwald and Ravensbrook, they weren't random servants they were girlfriends of Nazi high command, like Karl Brandt--Hitler's physician. This kind of colony approach to the death camps. * There are folks in the pizzagate world saying ""what's this all about?"" That's where the Hillary connection comes in with John Podesta. They use the Catholic Church *to 'diaspora'* (spread genetics far and wide) these folks around the world. So they needed a way of keeping track of them. And (I think) Podesta was one of those find-it men. * I realize this is an extreme topic. But the reason why these kids are valuable now is that their hearts and kidneys, their organs are a perfect genetic match going back to the father. This is the idea of Charles Lindberg having the 7 kids and so forth. I know it's a stretch. I know it's an outside possibility, but I wanted to give this to Pizzagate folks and have them drill down on what kind of experiments Mengele did with this virus that's called BVD Bornavirus Disease --- * [[**Day 112 part 2**]](URL * Quick proof of life -- Melissa Mccarthy did a funny Sean Spicer last night (SNL) * George noticed how the Dyncorp set of investments were like the old portfolio of the drug portfolio of IGFarben-Rockefeller joint venture * If Wall Street put all that money into those joint ventures for a better and higher use--for petroleum basically--then why would they throw it all away at the end of the war? * Then it makes perfect sense why *Operation Paperclip* happened and why the CIA created Dyncorp. Because bioweapons and human testing was morally reprehensible so they needed a 3rd party to do that. It's the same reason that sex trafficking and organ harvesting are run through DynCorp. * If you look at the Rockefeller banks and hospitals you have this repeating pattern, using the Pinkertons to clear the land---and once you get the land, then you do the human trafficking, the drug trafficking, now the opiods. It's a repeating pattern over and over. * Then placing secret armies with weapons caches in all these different countries--the Gladio program--is this other repeating pattern. Sibel Edmonds talks about this [Gladio II]. * Josephy Corbell--Madeline Albreight's dad--was the Gladio guy for Czechoslovakia, posing as a priest had an arms cache in the church. * Allen Dulles was using the *Salvation Army* as a front for the *Gladio* Program. Reminds me of how they compromised the Catholic priests in order to stow children at the orphanages at the Catholic Church * Again I ask the question: if the CIA is reallY DynCorp and DynCorp is really the old Wall St.-Pinkertons-Rockefeller program, would they do 191 countries around the world and then just forget about the United States, and just say well we'll that one alone? Doesn't seem like that would be the case. --- * [[**Day 113 part 1**]](URL * Quick recap of the toppling, ratlines, and how Palantir manages it * What allowed Hillary to go around the Congress, Senate Intelligence Committees, and House Intelligence Committees was spying. Tyler Drumheller was the key person in Osprey Global along with General Grange and Sid Blumenthal that enabled that to happen. * This happened 10 days ago, but and IT spy ring of 3 muslim brothers living in the same house was busted in Congress. Marie Bartaromo with that story. * Three brothers were able to be in the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the Dept Homeland Security Committee and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs-- the three key intelligence committees in the House. * HPSCI oversees the CIA, Homeland Security, ODNI, all the Military Intelligence agencies, 22 agencies it oversees. There were about 8 congresspeople involved in these hacks * Awan brothers--all under 22 years of age, and all making 160k/yr. Jamal Awan. * Haven't heard much about this in the press, a little on Barney and on Lou Dobbs. * This is equivalent to the Rosenbergs; they put the Rosenbergs to death, so I don't know why there hasn't been any arrests been made. They were fired from their jobs but they were caught hacking into these 8 representatives' accounts: Duckworth, Carson, Schult, Castro, Richmond, Frankel, Spier, ? (what's the eighth?). That's espionage act. That's death sentence. * Adam Schiff didn't say anything, CNN didn't say anything. * Ranking member of the Republican Congress in the House is @devinNunes. George asks people to send this video to devinNunes on Twitter. * Again, our enemies have more information than what's going on in our government than we do as citizens. This is further exemplified by the 650k emails * If you can circumvent the government with these 19 gmail accounts, then the enemies know more than the American public * We know these went to Israel Russia and China; but if the three brothers talk at all--all in the same house I assume they would, that means the intelligence is going to the Muslim Brotherhood. This is recent as in a couple of days ago. * The Muslim Brotherhood of those 32 countries now has that intelligence, so we need to know now more than ever those 650k emails. Families could be travelling, on business trips in these other countries and need to make informed decisions. * Not releasing this information is several felony violations of Federal Records Act ""CTC, D&amp;D"" * According to McCabe, it's going to take the FBI 5 yrs to process the 650k emails, but it's ok to let three treasonous Muslims take all the date from the 3 top Intelligence Agencies to the Muslim Brotherhood in 32 countries * This is beyond a National Security question, this is a failure of 3 branches of government * The address is @DevinNunes, he is the chairman, ranking member of the HPSCI * @DevinNunes needs to get on CNN to counterpoint Adam Schiff * Going after Assange, I think we have to go after Awan brothers equally--this is a hanging offense: ""Equal Protection Under the Law"" --- * [[**Day 113 part 2**]](URL * Trafficking networks are being exposed in a limited way, because if you don't expose in a limited way it goes all the way to the top, to Pug Winokur and that would totally stop it. * They get these guys in a room and they say, ""It's going to be 30 yrs if you squawk about the trafficking ring and how many people are involved, or it's going to be a year and a half of weekend jail if you don't. And if you keep persisting then you end up being thrown off a bridge or you die in a helicopter crash."" These guys play rough, it's Dyncorp for a reason. * The viruses they can always say, ""well you can't really prove that"", but trafficking and harvesting have very provable rings and all you need are 1-2 witnesses * For instance the coverup of the operation underground railroad that Beck took care of in Haiti. It's basically a red team from kissingers old red team days. Very thinly veiled with this social justice cover. It's a setup for DHS to do stings on unsuspecting guys trying to get them to go for younger and younger girls over time. It's an asset forfeiture ring. * Beck said 33 saved and 12 arrested at Kaliko beach club--he didnt mention anythign about a woman being shot in the head in front of other women? Was that because the woman was shot as a message to other women not to talk about the johns going over to Mirabalais for harvesting / processing? * Once the women get the men on film, that's all they need with the Nepalese police force at Mirabalais in order to say, ""ok, you can harvest him"" -- to the catfood factory he goes * Some people are saying, ""Man you're accusing the Clintons of some really weird stuff!"" * This is Dr. Guy Theodore, Hospital Bienfaisance (charity in french) in Pignon Haiti -- he got set up there by the Clintons. Here he is at little Rock air force base at 1983. Why do I say Clintons may be involved in organ harvesting, they were very involved in blood mining. If you know this investigative reporter Kelly Duda, he wrote a documentary called Factor 8--he's from ARkansas. This is what caused the HIV/Red Cross blood crisis of the mid-1980s, using all these patients' blood from the Arkansas prison system, HepC and HIV * When Hillary is first lady in 1998 she goes down to Haiti with George Soros after one of the storms (Haiti Bienfaisance)--she was shadow secretary of state--she also goes to various other central and s. american countries on that same trip. This is a swing through of all of the franchises. The best I can compare this to is a baseball league. Epstein is going to be major leagues, the AAA clubs the AA clubs and it's going to be all these things. * Haiti Bienfaisance is an orphanage and a hospital where you're going to have a weeding system in place (filtering); you'll see this in all orphanage/hospital combos. Maybe it started out mining the bone marrow from the dead bodies, but the problem with harvesting is that [the profit motive causes] you to make earlier calls on end-of-life. I started out having angels of death showing up in your order release because it is a valuable product. People start dying around when people need transplants. It's a slippery slope. As bodies become more valuable, then this activity provides a bad incentive for health. * Dr. Robert Ashton just jumped off the George Washington Bridge. He was married to this Jennifer Ashton, the medical correspondent on ABC News. He was involved in the Bronx transplant (organ transportation) center. The Bronx is where they are getting the hearts--he's a cardiac surgeon. If you want to target someone like this, you first break up their marriage. He goes to a conference, you send in the girl, you take the pictures, you get the pictures to the wife, she wants a divorce, now your life is ruined, and now he jumps off the GW bridge. * The other way to get rid of a doctor: get a witness against him. Take this case of the helicopter crash 5 yrs ago. This is the Mayo clininc in jacksonville Fla. What they do is take these three guys, profusion specialist, cardiac surgeon, ex old navy seal guy and say 'there's a heart down in Gainsville. Just reading 3rd party news stories I see that this lands in the woods that the helicopter would have gone if it had gone straight, but instead it lands in the woods, way off track. When these networks come to light, these are different ways you can suppress the witness, kill the witness. {{I think George is saying that Ashton had those 3 guys killed because one was a witness with blackmail leverage against him for illegal heart dealings. Not entirely sure}} * If we are going to give access to three muslim brothers the Awan brothers in the muslim brothers, three 22 yr old living in the same house in DC, give them access to all this information AND MORE, then why wouldn't the American people have a right to that information? Release the 650,000 emails! * [[**Day 113 part 3**]](URL * Proof of Life * The Awan brother I spoke about this morning -- they may have been the ones that tipped off ISIS in Yemen and that may have caused the death of the Navy Seal, so it's very good that at least we found this leak early rather than having to wait. * Keep sending @DevinNunes, the head of the house foreign intelligence committee, we really need arrests--I can't believe this wouldn't be espionage--death penalty, like the Rosenbergs got the electric chair --- * [[**Day 114 part 1**]](URL * I wanted to talk more about what I call the ""Dyncorp Sheriff"" -- this new phenom from these wars in Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, Afg., Haiti, there are these Dyncorp sheriffs being created from these mercenaries that were overseas training these police forces, and it's taking a militaristic turn. * Kathryn Bolkovac was a police officer in Dyncorp in Kosovo (""the Whistleblower"") made many accusations about the prostitution and sex trafficking by Dyncorp staff * Flint Chambers Orders 15 Yr Old Lap Dances at DynCorp -- Hillary Clinton seemed to be very interested in that particular email * Several articles have been written about Dyncorp getting in trouble around the world in this area * Article title: ""Prisoner says warren county jailers raped her, nurses refused to give her epilepsy medication"" -- she claims she was raped by 2 deputies at the insistence of a 3rd deputy on the floor on top of a garbage bag. Again, it would seem the deputies were forced into raping the girl. * Film: Trafficked / Lots of movies being made about this 'pattern' * Bob Mosier -- Faquier county (double-entendre of 'f*ck here', though George puts it more nicely) -- a rural county just west of DC. A lot of folks take their kids to Fuquier county to go to the roller rink or the farm day sort of thing. Lots of weird messages in far of those social media, lots of things to 'touch', boy scouts day. Check out the roller rink that's closing--those attractions tend to close when these investigations start. * I noticed on his resume that he's still working for DOD, worked for Dept of State, International Justice Mission where they save children, and then finally was a law enforcement technical advisor for DynCorp from 2001-2007, then there's an interesting insertion in this gap -- from 1996-1997 was in Bosnia -- the gap was 1997-2001 I wonder what he was doing in these 4 yrs. He was the culpepper county sheriff but lists it from 1998-2015. So was he sheriff while he was overseas, which is interesting because Culpepper county is in Virginia, not Libya; maybe it's a lend-lease program where they come and go * George discusses post yugoslavian countries, * And then notes that ""the Whistleblower"" was about where this sheriff was stationed--George asks the question: does DynCorp Sheriff Bob Mosier know Kathryn Bolkovac? {the plot thickents} * In the news the [Oroville] dam burst yesterday in the county just south of Sheriff Lopey's Siskiyou County, so I'm sure he's helping with Oroville, which I thank him very much for. But he also did these Weed wars. He's an ex-Dyncorp employee, but he does have this habit of doing these very militaristic raids. I just wondered if Sheriff Lopey knows Bob Mosier. That's my question for the day. * To follow up on another story, Glenn Beck went down to Haiti with a 3rd party NGO called Operation Underground Railroad to investigate human trafficking--turns out it's a bunch of Navy Seals led by Tim Ballard and they had a bust where they busted people at Kaliko Beach Club. * I've been in conversation with Vince Depatie and he's got good information for my next show. --- * [[**Day 114 part 2**]](URL * This is going to be a catchup on the virus * Timothy Alefantis has a virus/vaccine company called Vitalprobe that we'll get to * There was a drug arrest made between Colombia and Haiti so that's obviously a drug route * Big news is Joe Clancy has stepped down from the Secret Service * In previous episodes Clancy and McCabe had this agreement where the Secret Service were used in nighttime intrusion teams called ""prowler teams"". And now we've got 2-3 prowler teams that are talking and feeding information to Trump, the sneakernet thing with the screens and blind interviews. It will be interesting to see how Sessions deals with this. * If you're going to spy on someone like General Flynn then dont' use your own resources, use the Secret Service as an espionage shield {McCabe sneakiness}, they also have extensive cyber hacking capabilities. They also have a means to inhibit tracking of secret service personnel who are moonlighting on these teams. Trump is going to clean that up I'm sure, depending on who he names as the new SS guy. * Letter that Chaffetz sent on Jan 27 to the FBI that says, ""I want the 650k emails by Feb 10th"" -- that has come and gone and wasn't answered. That's another thwarting of the executive there. At least they could have produced the metadata. If there is a response, it would be nice to get Chaffetz to just respond by saying ""metadata""--that could not possibly be state secrets * Trump is against the wall now. They just took out Flynn. McCabe's illegal surveillance took out Flynn, so it's now or never. * Decameron Hotels in Haiti which I said was the funnel where Hillary's putting USAID money and the money from sex, drug, trafficking ops are going into these hotels. I specifically mentioned SEMEX. * Turns out Decameron started out in Bogota as a money funnel for the drug business in Colombia through 44 hotels 12k employees. * The Decameron hotel group ceo died oddly enough during a heart transplant operation (2015)^^[[]](URL * 34 americans here and 33 girls, and the girls are brought in one at time so no one would notice. Each american paired with a girl: wouldn't a girl be uncomfortable with that--with a stranger? * 12 people were arrested * The above is Vince Depatie's testimony * After the raid the other americans stayed there but left the next morning and didn't pay their bill * I think its interesting there were 20-21 other Americans involved but that weren't arrested. * Asked him for the names, said the hotel would not give them * What I'm saying about these Dyncorp Sheriffs that went to Bosnia and Kosovo where all these bad things happened. I'm saying this is being put on them by the State Dept and the CIA. * When I mentioned Bob Mosier was in Virginia a little west of DC, everything exploded on my comments * One of the bioweapons developed by Tim Alefantis of VitalProbes is Anthrax. They also have a lab an office in Florida. * AeroMD -- an ICU in the air * ""Girls 11, and 12, Shot in the head in separate Chicago shootings"" -- both are braindead--they went off to a children's hospital.

An anonymous twitter account pieced together all the pipeline strategy in addition to tying in Benghazi and also the $6B the US Government gave Iran (which was NOT for hostages even though we got hostages in return) and how Iran in turn transferred the money to Russia which pissed our Res &amp; HRC off URL The 6 Billion could have also been for this deal URL in which Iran took the money, gave the US the middle finger, and then signed with France. Qatar gave the C Foundation a $1M gift which the Foundation didnt notify the US Government, and since 1997 Saudi Arabia has donated between $10-$25M to the foundation. And while the US Government no longer funds the Free Syrian Army which turned into ISIL, Saudi Arabia still does URL and so for HRC to implement a no-fly zone over Syria, it would cut Russia out of control which would lead to conflict as they are supporting the Iranian pipeline. However, even if the pipeline is the main Middle Eastern issue, there are other reasons to be creating conflict &amp; war.  Assuming US involvement in the Syrian proxy war is NOT what they talk about (liberating Syria from Assad) but rather to get a cut from a pipelines profit, the C Foundation involvement in an issue that involves displacing people (moving Syrians all over the world) is a pattern.  Over the last 5 years, 360 registered refugee children in the UK have no gone missing, over 200 have been missing for over 2 years URL  Over the last 5 years, 1650 migrants who registered as children have gone missing in Sweden, a notoriously low-crime nation URL  Over the last 5 years, 8991 child refugees have gone missing in Germany URL  The Calais Jungle refugee encampment in France recently evacuated 6400 migrants to move them to different regions of France. There were 129 children missing URL  Since the arrival of refugees in Europe, over 10,000 children have gone missing URL  In the recent week: 1) Iceland kicks FBI out after authorities lie about visit to protect Iceland from a cyber attack against government databases; turned out they were only there to gather information on WikiLeaks URL 2) Norwegian police infiltrate a pedophile network, arresting 20 and having 31 more suspects.

URL  Leading up to the strange, seemingly coded emails leaked, along with the senders and recipients of the emails, there were 2-3 decades filled with undebatable pedophilia in DC, and around the world in elite places. These are to serve as anchoring facts.  People started to look into the coding when Anthony Weiners (he himself is a pedophile, and husband to HRCs top aide Huma Abedin) laptop was confiscated by the NYPD, and handed over to the FBI.  handkerchief pizza URL email sender (Sandler) pays him $7000 a month URL also talking to Sandler URL  Email with Marina Abramovic about coming over for Spirit Cooking URL  Emails showed communication with Comet Pizza, which is owned by James Alefantis who was the boyfriend of David Brock who founded Media Matters for America, and then Correct The Record (CTR), which was widely used during HRCs presidential campaign.  Comet Pizza and the next 3 businesses are owned by HRC people. The head of the child trafficking branch of the FBI owns a pizza place 4 doors down from Comet called Besta (Beast) Pizza which recently changed its logo; the old one was a pedophile symbol for boy lover. The store in between Alefantis owned Comet Ping Pong and Bucks is owned by a man who is hired by the owner of Politics &amp; Prose Bookstore, an associate/speech writer for, which is strange since hes running Little Red Fox and also helping fun the bookstore URL  Comet pizza has a password access part of website  George Soros gave them $11,000 dollars +Future  Salon magazine (who vehemently calls to end fake news and yet posts things like this, HRCs 95% of winningwhich is owned/funded by IAC URL a company that Chelsea Clinton is on the board of members) published this article in May 2016 URL essentially calling be open minded towards pedophiles as an orientation, using phrases such as an out pedophile much like a non-closeted member of the LGBT community. Perhaps an interesting conversation if were considering it a mental ILLNESS or cause/effect of an emotional trauma taking place in ones childhood (not an orientation) but then in Sept. of 2016 Salon followed up with this article about how the previous article outraged The Right URL mixing in politics which automatically gains support because if one side finds this gross, the other side should, therefore, be supportive and thus this article is trying to arm-bar The Left into a potential future where pedophiles are viewed as a sexual orientation and that its absurd/bigoted to disagree.  The additional argument has been made that in the Middle East it is not uncommon to see a man marrying/owning a girl as young as 12 URL 1/3 of marriages in Jordan are of girls under the age of 18 &amp; also URL Brian Stone, HRC Campaign paid writer and Huffington Post, a HRC Campaign paid publication URL wrote an article about how America should look to become just like Dearborn, MI (44% population Arab-American, largest proportion of Arab-Americans in the US), and then said think of how far ahead wed be as a country if we were following Dearborns lead URL which is interesting since the Middle East as a whole doesnt rank on the global ranking index for best countries to live in at all, (below North Korea which his the last ranked) URL no-one are ranked other than Qatar, U.A.E., and Israel which are low URL and the U.A.E. only has a decent economic ranking due to oil, the rest are in the bottom 1/4th globally URL  Which leads to the point that when objectively looking at the treatment of Islam vs Judism or Christianity in the US, we see a suppression of Christian ideals (heterosexual-marriage only, anti-abortion; again, doesnt matter your personal beliefs, just objectively comparing) and the praise of Muslim successes. Example: President-elect Trump to appoint Stephen Bannon; anti-semitic remarks. The next DNC will likely select Keith Ellison as chair, a man who while being the spokesman for the Nation of Islam in his 30s constantly had anti-semitic remarks, and this is not in the media URL  Go back to the 60s with MK Ultra, and the 80s when KGB defector Yuri Bezmenov talked about Soviet use of ideological submersion. Now plug in globalism; the movement to become 1 people, to have no borders. On a global scale, this effects major international corporations being able to more freely do trade, utilize areas of land, control smaller nations and larger amounts of people. Think of how in Europe, countries were told to set aside their own cultures to make way for refugees and their culture. Remember that the refugee crisis we know almost certainly know was not about freeing Syria from Assad, but rather simply profiting from oil. Germany is on the verge of collapse URL as is France URL and this article talks about how Muslim men, not because of who they are, but because of the culture they come from, are 23 times more likely than Swedish men in Sweden to commit rape. It also talks about how Japan did not open its doors to refugees stating Japan doesnt want to commit cultural suicideURL So, step 1) is to, through war and other events that break the averages persons A=B interactions through hysteria/chaos, develop a mass mindset that it is ok to move around/displace countries worth of people and that where ever they land we are helping them even though the chaos is fabricated, and that their culture needs to be recognized and further more, praised over the home countrys as this is a step in creating a global, singular culture. Step 2) rationalize and come to accept pedophilia (as that Salon article attempted to do) so that when moving around masses of people, it doesnt have to be hidden that thousands of children are going missing since pedophilia will be a new orientation to respect. When 47% is dependent on a nations government URL it only takes 5-10% to have a majority and which point most people will do what the government wants to do, since they rely on the government. Just this alone ties in with a globalist idea; would it not be better for less people to become more self-sufficient individuals? Going back to the acceptance of pedophiles as sexual orientations, this seems like a thought planted to grow in a couple decades to come to fully accept pedophiles as a natural orientation.  This mentality gets all the people involved in PizzaGate off the hook and forms a global society that caters to elitist needs."

56,cyber-crime,conspiracy,Anybody else have a distinct sense that there's a major false flag incoming?,384,5i9al6,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5i9al6/anybody_else_have_a_distinct_sense_that_theres_a/,2016-12-14 18:24:25,"Just a theory, wondering if anyone else is seeing this unfold. Russia will be formally accused of hacking our election. But this is *not* going to be used to make the EC vote differently. It is going to be used as a pretext to launch a cyber counter-attack on Russia (as Biden already said), a process that will ultimately force Russia into conflict. How do we know this? Because the ruling regime will lose a civil war, so civil war is not an option. Assassinating Trump or flipping the EC would both trigger civil war -- which the State will lose -- so that is not an option. (Cross reference ""Red Team Planner."") But they feel they *can* win WW3. They have already been preparing. It is something they've already been planning. It is a nuclear exchange with Russia. There is one problem: Russia has the blackmail videos of politicians raping children. Up til now, Russia has used the threat of a leak as a deterrent against conflict. (Confirmed by FBI Anon.) Now, here's the only way for the political class to eliminate that threat of exposure, keep Trump out, and go ahead with the conflict that has been planned for quite some time now (the plan that Hillary was supposed to carry out). It you assume they are thinking logically, it is their best and possibly only available option at this point. Look at the patterns and you'll see. Bill Gates suddenly portayed by media as open to Trump. (Thus he (or rather his OS) will not be suspected as involved.) NYT suddenly saying Russia can plant child porn on computers. Folks they are setting the stage already. Here's how they can still win, if.you assume they are rational actors and need to cover up their crimes to maintain power. Many of our machines will be infected with child porn nationwide. They probably already have been. (Anybody notice your comp acting weird lately? Have you noticed any honeypot links? Increased updates, perhaps? Freezing as if something is being downloaded? Did you get any recent ""Amber alerts"" on your smartphone?) Suddenly thousands will be seeing brutal child rape. On their phones, on their computers. Maybe on Televisions. It will sicken the nation. If it involves a child being killed, it will be big. Very big. It may absolutely traumatize the nation. It will be made to look as if it is Russia planting snuff films/child porn on machines. There might be massive concurrent DDoS attacks as well, which again will be pinned on Russia. Why something so insane like this? Why a false flag of this nature, as opposed to one which, say, shuts down the power grid? Well, you've got to place yourself in the position of a rational politician who risks being exposed to appreciate how it would function as the best exit strategy. Its function is to dilute any attempt by leakers to release the REAL footage implicating the political class. If it is on all of our machines, or even just a sufficient number of machines, it will be impossible at that point for Americans to distinguish between a real leak and ""Russian cyber attack."" It will be a crisis. And the frame is set so that anything released must be a cyber attack from Russia. It will be pinned on a Russian cyber attack. Russia plants child porn, remember? The NYT said so. This is also why NYT and others have all pulled the stories on the Norwegian pedo ring. They don't want the public to be conscious of the very real precedent that politicians are in pedo rings. They instead want the public thinking any cp that is found must be a Russian cyber attack. It's really the only way they can escape this. An EMP would be too costly and transparent. The narrative is already in place. It will be the digital 9/11. The Internet will have to be restricted and mostly shut down, and people will understand once they are convinced Russia is putting CP on our machines. (This will silence most of us and prevent us from accessing info and dissenting.) A cyber attack will be initiated on Russia (as Biden confirmed in a previous interview) that will be sufficient to force Russia into a war. People (idiots) will also welcome this, as they will be so outraged by the CP ""planted by Russia."" And Russia also ""tampered with our election to install that racist Trump."" The MSM will all be making it appear that Americans want Obama to strike back. Israel has already mobilized in Syria. US has sent more as well, and ships are also in place in key locations. Mobilization has been occurring for the last six months. The first round of nuclear exchange will then occur. Why? Because Russia cannot win in conventional warfare, and so must rely on nuclear weapons. And you can guess the rest. You are seeing it unfold now with the saber rattling against Russia. Can we stop it? Perhaps. Only way is to warn everybody right now to expect a false flag of any form and to provide a range of scenarios that might occur. Pre-emptive exposure might work. Edit to add: a commenter on Voat posted a similar line of thought regarding the recent ""findingassange.com"" link that has been circulating. ***TL;DR:*** be on high fucking alert for any kind of digital false flag being used as a pretext to attack Russia, check the authenticity of everything you read extremely carefully (""verify everything"" ought to be our motto right now). REALLY hate to be the one to hypothesize this , but here is one possible way that the ""findingassange.com"" website could be a trap: * The website delivers the 15,000 emails and two Insurance Files on schedule. * They appear to be authentic * Everybody goes nuts, using the contents of the data dump to launch the biggest lynch mob the world has ever seen. [perhaps there is child porn as an ""attachment to John Podesta's email""] * Our friendly neighborhood Intelligence Agency (CIA for example) then announces that careful forensic examination of the files proves them to be extremely sophisticated forgeries, such clever forgeries that only a ""State Player"" would have the financial resources technical capability to pull it off (Russia for example) * Our own careful forensic examination eventually determines that the files have indeed been fucked with. Although MUCH of the incriminating CONTENT revealed in the files appears to be both true and authentic the SOURCES of the files have been altered (in a manner that only a real expert could detect) to make them appear to have come from ..... you guessed it ...... Russia. * To make matters worse, SOME of the most outrageously salacious content ( the kind most likely to spread out through the internet social networks fastest and hottest ) are just straight up bullshit forgeries. * The FORGED (false) documents will be the ones that our friendly neighborhood law enforcement agencies actually investigate, and of course the alleged crimes will be quickly PROVEN to be total frame-ups. * These FALSELY alleged crimes, now exposed as total forgeries, will then be used to discredit * ALL of the evidence in the 15,000 emails and 2 insurance files. * The bad guys can now cast serious doubt on any and all crimes exposed in all of the documents. * The good guys look like gullible assholes. * CIA puts Hillary in the Whitehouse. * Our job becomes infinitely more difficult, sifting the wheat from the chaff and being forced to find NEW evidence for everything, because the old evidence has been rendered pretty useless. Is this scenario plausible ? There's only one other way that the political class could be in absolute checkmate right now, and that is if the leak clearly shows an ***identifiable politician*** on video raping a child. For example, if it is clearly Podesta in the video, then at that point nobody will care if Russia or whoever leaked it, nor can the political class use anything close to the exit strategies outlined above -- the crime would be so heinous it would spark rebellion. A response like ""but Russia leaked my pedophilia so we should attack Russia"" would not even be resorted to. "

62,cyber-crime,conspiracy,I've been hearing a lot lately about a national police force. Here's what I've found so far.,10,35jt69,http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/35jt69/ive_been_hearing_a_lot_lately_about_a_national/,2015-05-11 11:31:26,"What do you folks see that stand out in this document? Does the source seem reliable? Do y'all have any other credible resources that would add to this discussion? There's [this](URL the Unified Police Department website, formerly the Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office. At first glance, this is looking bad, but I'd like to have a discussion and have some fresh eyes pore over these. Text copied from [here.](URL ""American expectations of how their government secures the United States have evolved substantially, especially during the post-9/11 decade. From the post-World War II, 20th-century evolution of the national security architecture in the United States, focused on countering overseas nation-states with conventional forces, we now face requirements to protect at home. And not only to protect, but to prevent: the new, domestic security architecture is targeted more at securing borders, infrastructure, and cyberspace with defensive measures as it is at pursuing any single adversary with offensive measures. The growth of our expectations of domestic security, and the evolution of threats away from traditional state actors toward non-state entities -- drug cartels, organized crime, and terrorism are prominent examples -- suggest that the DHS intelligence mission should be threat agnostic. Though the impetus for creating this new agency, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, was clearly terrorismbased, the kinds of tools now deployed, from border security to cyber protection, are equally critical in fights against emerging adversaries. The DHS enterprise is more complex than other agencies responsible for Americas security, and its intelligence mission is correspondingly multifaceted. Its intelligence missions range from providing homeland security-specific intelligence at the federal level; integrating intelligence vertically through DHS elements; and working with state/local/private sector partners to draw their intelligence capabilities into a national picture and provide them with information. DHS, as it works to sharpen these missions, benefits from both a legislative mandate and a competitive advantage in a few areas that are unique within the federal intelligence community:  Securing borders and analyzing travel -- from threats such as terrorists, drug cartels, and alien smugglers -- including integrating travel data with other federal information;  Protecting critical infrastructure, from advising transportation partners on how to secure new transport nodes to providing sectors with after-action analysis of the infrastructure vulnerabilities exposed by overseas attacks; and  Preventing cyber intrusions, from red-teaming vulnerabilities in the US private sector to sharing best practices among corporate entities. Many agencies conduct all-source analysis of threat based on more traditional models of intelligence. As DHS grows its intelligence mission, though, we should understand that its development will benefit from unique data and responsibilities that other agencies do not share. The foundation for a separate DHS intelligence mission includes a few key elements:  Access to unique, homeland-relevant data, such as CPB and ICE information;  Responsibility for securing the border and critical infrastructure;  Access to personnel who have intimate tactical knowledge of current issues and trends in these areas; and  Responsibility for serving state/local partners as well as private sector partners in key infrastructure sectors. In an age of budget constraints, pressure on DHS to focus on core areas of responsibility and capability -- and to avoid emphasis on areas performed by other entities -- may allow for greater focus on these areas of core competency while the agency sheds intelligence functions less central to the DHS mission. Analysts and managers in Washingtons sprawling intelligence architecture often speak of the value of competitive analysis -- analysts at different agencies, for example, looking at similar problems to ensure that we miss no new perspective, no potentially valuable data source. There remains room for this type of analysis, but there are enough agencies pursuing the terrorist adversary to allow DHS to build a new analytic foundation that emphasizes data, analytic questions, and customer groups that are not the focus for other agencies. Analysis that helps private-sector partners better understand how to mitigate threats to infrastructure, for example, should win more resourcing than a focus on all-source analysis of general threats, such as work on assessing the perpetrators of attacks. Conversely, all-source analysis of terrorist groups and general terrorist trends should remain the domain of other intelligence agencies. In contrast to intelligence agencies that have responsibilities for more traditional areas of national security, DHSs mandate should allow for collection, dissemination, and analytic work that is focused on more specific homeward-focused areas. First, the intelligence mission could be directed toward areas where DHS has inherent strengths and unique value (e.g., where its personnel and data are centered) that overlap with its legislative mandate. Second, this mission direction should emphasize areas that are not served by other agencies, particularly state/local partners whose needs are not a primary focus for any other federal agency. In all these domains, public and private, DHS customers will require information with limited classification; in contrast to most other federal intelligence entities, DHS should focus on products that start at lower classification levels, especially unclassified and FOUO, and that can be disseminated by means almost unknown in the federal intelligence community (phone trees, Blackberries, etc.). Partnerships and collaboration will be a determining factor in whether this refined mission succeeds. As threat grows more localized, the prospect that a state/local partner will generate the first lead to help understand a new threat, or even an emerging cell, will grow. And the federal governments need to train, and even staff, local agencies, such as major city police departments, will grow. Because major cities are the focus for threat, these urban areas also will become the sources of intelligence that will help understand these threats at the national level, DHS might move toward decentralizing more of its analytic workforce to partner with state/local agencies in the collection and dissemination of intelligence from the local level. This new approach to intelligence -- serving local partners requirements, providing intelligence in areas (such as infrastructure) not previously served by intelligence agencies, and disseminating information by new means -- reflects a transition in how Americans perceive national security. For this reason, state/local agencies, as clients for DHS intelligence, should also be involved in the development of requirements for what kinds of intelligence on emerging threats would be most helpful, from changing tactics for smuggling aliens into the United States to how to understand overseas terrorist incidents and translate them into analysis for the US. Similarly, different private sectors in the United States, from the hospitality industry to transportation, should drive requirements for DHS, in addition to serving as sources for information about what emerging vulnerabilities these industries are seeing. DHS should utilize existing public private partnerships to both drive requirements and aid distribution. After the Mumbai attacks, for example, DHS intelligence might have partnered with private sector entities in the hospitality industries -- and state and local police agencies responsible for major hotel centers and ports -- to develop unclassified graphics and text explaining how the terrorists entered ports; how they breached perimeter security at facilities in the city; how security within facilities struggled during the ensuing battle; and how the attacks compared with other attacks in recent years against public buildings. Most or all of this information would have been available in public media, and it can be displayed in interactive, graphic format, with support from analysts who specialize not in international terrorism but instead in engineering, building security, port security, etc. The requirements for any product would have been driven by the hospitality industry and major city police chiefs. None of this bears any resemblance to what more traditional intelligence agencies have done since in post-WWII world of foreign intelligence; this type of analytic product is more closely aligned with the new, and growing, world of homeland security intelligence. By focusing intelligence collection, dissemination, and analysis in these areas, DHS could grow an intelligence architecture that builds on its core strengths, avoid competition with agencies in other areas, such as general terrorism analysis; and provide unique product and partnerships that other agencies not only lack but are will not view as their core competencies. Because homeland security intelligence requires a new understanding of products, customers, and delivery, training managers and analysts must reflect a way of doing business that is fundamentally different than the business practices taught at agencies that have focused historically on foreign intelligence. DHS might consider the development of a homeland security training institute that develops this training -- from new ways to portray information geospatially to different paths for developing requirements from state and local partners -- as an entirely new enterprise. This training should include a separate element responsible for research, for bringing in American and foreign scholars who look at this issue, and for ensuring that doctrines for collecting, reporting, and analyzing knowledge in the homeland security environment is captured in one place and documented. The creation of DHS led to a rapid growth in a workforce, and a thirst for analytic product, that required the US Government to move quickly, before the foundations of homeland security intelligence were established and before we had the luxury of a full post-9/11 decade to understand where we need to go. We have an opportunity now to step back and review how much this new enterprise differs from traditional analysis, and how we can succeed, beyond what we understood even five years ago, in delivering new, innovative product to different customers. And in how we can develop simple processes through which they deliver clear requirements to analysts in Washington and at fusion centers across the country. This review provides that opportunity."" "

AKA Organized Stalking, Vigilante Stalking, Cause Stalking Candice Nguyen from KION is doing a story ion this phenomenon called ""Gang Stalking"". It has nothing to do with ""gangs"", rather it is a form of cyber-bullying. The intent is a psychological impact and socially ostresizing the targeted person. With tools available to track someone it has made people more vulnerable to this. It has implications to workplace violence, love relationships gone bad, etc. I told Candice it is like Mean Girls or cyber-bullying on steroids. What is gang stalking and electronic harassment? Gang stalking is a form of community mobbing and organized stalking combined. Just like you have workplace mobbing, and online mobbing, which are both fully recognized as legitimate, this is the community form. Electronic Harassment is when someone uses any electronic device to aid them in invading your person or property for the purpose of gathering information illegally, or for the purpose of causing harm. Electronic Harassment comes in many forms and types. It can be used for surveillance, sabotage, interference, directed energy weapons, etc. Organized stalking is probably a better term than gang stalking since it more accurately conveys the systematic nature of the crime, and it avoids creating the erroneous impression that the activity is connected with street gangs. Gang stalking is organized harassment at it's best. It the targeting of an individual for revenge, jealousy, sport, or to keep them quiet, etc. It's a psychological attack that can completely destroy a persons life, while leaving little or no evidence to incriminate the perpetrators."" Most targets are women, minorities, dissidents, whistle blowers, and outspoken. URL"

Only the CIA would be the ones who couldn't be bought by thier targets. Only the CIA could keep this down to a dull roar in the media. Only the CIA would have these bankers involved with knowledge outside the normal white collar crime. Other wise the bankers would have just shut up and did thier time. It is worse than that. The CIA is the first place any one with have a brian would look to when a serial murder or contract murder spree like this happens, whith no news coverage what so ever, minus the news outside of the control of those in that circle they are the cleaners for. If anyone has any doubts it is the CIA, they are probably working for the CIA. The only questions left, what did these bankers know? What could they have exposed? What pile of money could they have gotten in the way of making? Who were these bankers informing on? Possibly the CIA themselfes. They have been busy? If you have any doubts, who other than the CIA could pull this off? No one. What a list, to think every one of these people had families, kids, spouces, parents, pets, and alot were trying to do right, and the killers go free, while these families lost loved ones, and will never see justice.

[Is This a Joke: Obama seems to be the only one who didn't get the memo that North Korea didn't do it](URL Many sources are now claiming that FBI has proof, including such basic ones that IP addressing that directly incriminates North Korea. So the FBI says so, the government says so and is acting upon it and as we know the hackers only demands was in the interest of North Korea.. No money demands.. Just ""Don't show it"" I think even the most skeptical ones can at this point say its likely it was in fact North Korea sponsored cyber crimes. Some conspiracies are obv real with legitimate Merits, but unfortunately some opinions or assumptions gets put within the same category. This takes away focus and credibility from the real issues, such as privacy and corporate and political corruption which is so important to reveal for all of our futures. I wish r/conspiracy/ members were more fact focused and selective with what it gives the spotlight to and not upvoting loaded posts based on pure personal emotions, opinions and/or at best guesswork. By not doing so, it directly harms the important issues of the day which so many are blind to and also it directly plays into the hands of the very people who are actually involved in conspiracies. statements like ""deranged obama"" etc while drawing conclusions a subject with basically ZERO insight, is embarrassing for any skeptical thinker. What makes anyone here think they are in a better position than Obama to draw conclusions on this? How do anyone here know who hacked Sony? And even so, who cares about a stupid movie, why give it this much attention? To no ones surprise it turns out it was North Korea after all, easily proven by novice mistakes repeatedly made. Surprisingly it turns out that our government who basically spies on everyone is able solve a cyber crime of national interest... If there is any ""conspiracy"" worth attention here, its the fact that after all these sanctions and demonizing of North Korea over the years, they have all these years until now been allowed to use the US banking system to sell and buy weapons!..
