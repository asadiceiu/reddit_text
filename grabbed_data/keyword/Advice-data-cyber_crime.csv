Or anyone tbh The cyber crimes prosecutor in the country I live in is fabricating crimes and fabricating guilty confessions. He is can be easily kicked out the second the issue becomes international, as government officials are disposable here. We already payed equal to 12k usd in fines and the non-refundable bail for a fabricated crime in the year long court case. and just (yesterday) another one is being filed, we got a call saying they are summoning the accused for investigation, I cant go through it again, not another year. We wont go to the prosecutions initial investigation so that it would be transferred out of the cybercrime and to the regular public prosecutors (since the issue is no longer just cyber related but instead its us ignoring their summoning to court) which hopefully they arent corrupted. However if it does get transferred out of cybercrime, an arrest warrant will be issued (for the second time this year) Unfortunately we are foreigners and cant go back to the home country as I have a arrest warrant waiting for me since I am a draft dodger. (My country is in an almost decade-long civil war) All of this while money income is gone due to covid"

4,cyber crime,Advice,How do i deal with my family in quarantine?,1,hchd76,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hchd76/how_do_i_deal_with_my_family_in_quarantine/,2020-06-20 16:46:56,"This is gonna be a long one but here goes. I'm 14 almost 15 years old. I have two moms, wife and wife, a twin brother and an older brother 3 years older than me. My older brother was conceived from the same sperm donor as me and my twin, but he was carried by mom A and we were carried by mom B. This means that me and my twin are not related to mom A. There is a disconnect in the family between me and my twin and mom B and my older brother and mom A. Mom B loves the three of us the same, but mom A favors my older brother, who is near perfect with a 1580 SAT score and perfect grades at one of the most difficult private schools in the whole country, which we all go to. Me and my twin have GPA's around 3.3. We also get into trouble and he does not. I've (allegedly ;))done drugs and alcohol, smoked and committed cyber crimes which I will not name. Mom A has said things like ""they are not my own"" in front of us and various similar things to mom B. She also is very quick to anger and gets mad at the three of us, even my older brother for pretty small things. I don't open up about these things to kids at school, but I've been told ""your parents don't love you"" or asked ""why doesn't your mom love you"" by at least four different people. My getting in trouble started in February 2019 and has continued to may 1st 2020 when I got caught by my parents for cyber crime for the first time. This really upset my parents and it got to the point where mom A expressed her resentment towards me to the point where it seemed like she wanted to disown me. Since i first got caught doing drugs in feb 2019, my parents always hold it over me saying how i betray their ""trust"" which really never was there in the first place. They don't let me have a normal middle/high school experience. I can't go to parties or hang out with friends at night or even in groups. I can't seem to find anything I enjoy in life anymore because I always have to think about my moms reaction to everything. Any time I come home from about anything, mom B coaches me on how to not upset mom A when I get home. Mom A blames mom B for how bad I am all the time, causing me to feel responsible for her getting blamed, even though i know it's unreasonable to blame her. I've had depression since probably fourth grade at age nine. I used to beat myself till I was bruised all over and I can't explain why. I turn to drugs and alcohol to escape and feel some sort of good for a short time. Mom A always demonizes me, causing me to have very low self-esteem, causing me to have social anxiety. The only difference between me, a kid whos friends are all popular and a popular kid is caused by that. Also that i cant rage and go to parties. This pandemic traps me in the house with this woman and it is horrible. All the does is talk on the phone all day and it's 99% complaining. It drives me crazy. Mom B is extremely hard working, in order to provide us with a good education. When I get a bad grade, It's only mom A who threatens to pull me out of the school. Anything she does that's nice for me, she holds over me and uses against me. The difference between my and her childhood is that i have nosy parents always trying to catch me doing something. What the hell happened to parents who don't pay attention that closely and let their kids be fucking kids? I have never heard someone say ""boy i wish my parents payed more attention to me (in that way, not in the caring way) as a teenager."" I hate living. Quarantine is fucking hell. I don't have my phone because my mom took it away and put tracking software on my laptop. It's been a month and nineteen days since i was able to contact and talk to anyone of my friends. I want to run away so fucking bad I hate her so much. What the hell do I do I want my phone so fucking bad. Mom B tries to ask her when I can get my phone back but she always changes the subject. Theres a diff between tryna catch your child and giving them attention. I wanna kms but when I'm 18 i can go crazy on the drugs and get fucked up and not have to deal with her. PLEASE WTF DO I DO?? I hope someone read this prob not"
5,cyber crime,Advice,I am a YouTuber stalked and harassed for over a year by a man I turned down bc he has kids,1,grgktv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/grgktv/i_am_a_youtuber_stalked_and_harassed_for_over_a/,2020-05-27 19:34:26,"Let me start by saying that this is not a self promo, I wont share my videos, services etc but I have to explain this hot mess! I am married and started as a fence sitter who later turned CF. I made videos about it and openly discussed why because when you post things from your personal life, people often ask ""what about kids"". So anyone watching my channel knew where I stand. A year ago I separated temporarily with my husband and I made a video with the title ""list of qualities I want in a boyfriend"". It was a silly parody of the insane standards that many white women have when it comes to men (I am white but I enjoy talking about controversial things) and I said I want someone over 6 ft, with at least 150 IQ, u get the point. Then this guy emails me saying ""he fits every requirement"" and wants to talk to me. Btw I am in Eastern Europe and he is American. He sent me his name and Amazon link for his (failed) books. I have a very tech savvy friend who did a bit of digging and..the guy is divorced with 2 kids AND an ex convict bc he threatened the FBI! I told him I am not interested in dating and that he should have informed me that he has kids. He acted extremely offended saying that ""he didn't know kids are a deal breaker"" and then accused me of ""not being in real life because mentioning you have kids attracts pedophiles"". Ever since it has been a year. He makes accounts to harass me and send me hundreds of emails and makes one hour long videos ranting about how he is ""busy parenting"" and how distance between us is a problem (!) He is also bragging that since I am not American there is nothing I can do to him to stop the harassment. My lawyer told me to go to the cyber crime police department, but now with the pandemic it's extremely hard and even if I open a case it will take forever. This man is 39, has been working dead end jobs all his life and ""has no true calling"" (his own words) and ""does parenting stuff that I wouldn't understand"". I don't know if it is allowed but I am sharing his latest harassing video for anyone who wants to see what I am dealing with. I am depressed, angry, creeped out and stressed and there doesn't seem to be ending. URL Any advice would be very appreciated. Thank you for providing a safe space for those who aspire for something beyond the life script."

So I have two cousins, one who is 13 and another one who is 20. Me and the 20 year old have been banned from talking to the 13 year old or seeing her because of past cyber bullying incidents involving my aunt and her family. My aunt thinks we are terrible people and bad influences and has banned us from ever seeing her kids. Now my other cousin who is 11 has been following me for years. The 13 and 11 year old live together. A few days ago one of the 13 year olds accounts decided it wanted to follow me and talk to me which I thought was weird but ok. All of a sudden it kept bringing up past issues and how it was sad we never get to see eachother anymore and how she hates the 20 year old and how she even hates her own mother (shes a mamas girl). And shes sneaking around on her phone during school and yadda yadda. Weird... And then asked me questions if I ever snuck around to talk to somebody and got in trouble (yeah with you when I was 14). Then shes like nobody in my house knows Im talking to you dont tell anyone (who am I going to tell your mother hates me) I thought it was the 20 year old for a while but idk. My Instagram account is a private account. So then she said she was going snow tubing yesterday, meanwhile the account wouldnt send me pictures of snow tubing or any selfies. Very one worded responses. I asked her sister if she was snow tubing with her sister and she said that her sister was at musical practice and she doesnt think thats the 13 year old. Today I said hows my favorite cousin doing? Lets share selfies with this filter. She didnt even read it. Then I called her out saying  listen here asshole, I know this is *20 year olds name* this is completely pathetic that you are hacking/impersonating our little cousin to try and talk to me. I knew it was you all along. You wouldnt send me any selfies. My family is done with your drama. Leave us alone. Its not funny. Its not cute. I dont want to talk to you or have anything to do with you. Yeah we both have made mistakes growing up and did some pretty shitty things to destroy this family but even I know impersonating/hacking someone is a crime and I wouldnt do it. This is ridiculous. This conversation is over, goodbye she still hasnt read that yet but the account wont load. I think she deleted it. But the messages are still showing. There are 3 other accounts out there....and Im not sure if my 13 year old cousin knows she has access to them or not. Completely ridiculous. They havent tried to talk or follow me yet. My aunt hates us both with a strong passion. So idk if I should just let it go or bring it up but I feel like if I bring it up it would cause more drama."

At 18 I got caught selling drugs to a minor. Xanax pills, I had a gun to and I also had pulled a gun out on someone earlier that day. I was on drugs bad.

9,cyber crime,Advice,"Please, Stop Lying",1,evybln,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/evybln/please_stop_lying/,2020-01-30 13:44:45,"22m The title says it all. This subreddit and most advice subs are full of lies and people who aren't really struggling lying to those who are. If you think you can change my mind or offer me advice that I haven't already tried go ahead. I will defiantly try it, I don't want my opinions to be true. BUT Lets be real here for a brief moment. We all know for a fact, that looks, and status and money are more important to a relationship than personality is. This is a fact. No ifs, no ands, no buts. It is the way it is. This isn't theory. This is fact, looks open the door for a relationship, looks make you more important and looks 100% define if you will be successful in a relationship at all. Don't lie and say this isn't the case. IT IS THE CASE. Let me tell you some personal experinces ive had with women, im incel, have and will always be incel. I didn't put that label on myself. YOU GUYS DID. I didn't even know what an incel was before reddit hounded me for being one. The existence of incels should tell you something is up. I didn't wake up one day with bad ideas about women and men. Nah, they developed very slowly and methodically as I grew up. As a kid I was always bullied, by both men and women. Women would make fun of me, hard. I remember on a bus to a field trip, no seats were open, so I sat next to a girl, and said ""hey whats up?"" she looks at me in disgust.... "" WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?!"" I looked at her in shock, ""uhm you?"" I replied... she gets up and storms out of the seat, and sits next to two other girls. I looked at them and my eyes started to tear up... I said ""what did I do?"" her attractive blond friend looked at me and said ""SHUT THE FUCK UP.... NO ONE LIKES YOU!!!"" I literally teared up writing this, and everytime I bring stories of how women have treated me up, you guys say im a liar. This is the cold hard truth of how it is for guys like me. throughout school I never, never got the chance to date or have friends. So don't sit and call me entitled, this has nothing to do with entitlement. Its called being a good person and treating me like a human. They watched me cry man. but guess what? I think they felt bad about it cause once I got to high school people did actually start treating me better, even those mean girls, they started saying hi to me in the halls and stuff. I think they honestly felt bad for how they treated me in middle school. but anyway I ended up getting into drugs and all that and made some ""friends"" these friends would constantly CONSTANTLY, hound on me for being a virgin, my nickname was retardo, 40 year old virgin, cause ig I look old for my age and ""extra duhhh"" cause im that slow these friends would only hang out with me when I had money, so id steal and rob to have extra cash so I wouldn't be so alone and could afford to do drugs with my ""friends"" When id call them, theyd put the phone on speaker when they were having sex with girls they met, and than id hang up and get a text later saying ""that's a sound you will never hear"" id cry. but that's how it is for guys like me. I decided id become a drug dealer, thatll show everyone! ill have money, girls will like me, they'll see! I got a job at mcdonalds and saved up for my first ounce of weed, and started selling it for ridiculously low prices, to get clientele, ppl were finally texting me! ppl were finally calling me! girls were actually talking to me! wow! I started moving up to half pounds and pills and everything I could sell, it was so fun. but.... they were all just using me. I never kissed any of those girls nor did they have sex with me or go on dates with me. I was alone as always got kicked out of school twice went to prison twice. and at 18 went to prison for years.... in prison my awkwardness my shyness my small frame, I got bullied by the other men so bad, theyd make fun of my virginty to, you know how it is? You meet older guys and they ask ""u know any girls? huh? u getting girls?"" all I can do is say... ""uhhh no?..."" HAHAHAHAHA VIRGIN HAHAHHA I got out of prison at 20 years old, and deep down I did hate women to the core. I mean are you guys going to sit here and deny how they treated me? Fuck you for that before u even comment. and anything suggesting im a liar ill just ignore. Now as an isolated child I did get good at one thing, technology, I was obsessed with computers and everything else, SO, I actually made an improvement when I got out of prison. cause I mean, I used to hack girls I like in high school, on some script kiddie shit. Taught myself how to code with books and youtube. I said imma go to college for information security. im going to change my life! I may not be strong and tall and brave like other guys, but from a computer I can do good in the world and stop cyber crime. Redemption. girls aren't really into computers but I mean I got a job to and actually started working on my social anxiety, of course when I meet girls, all I know about besides drugs is computers. So I will talk about computers and technology to them. They just cringe and walk away. Even girls that are in IT seem to not really like it and be doing It for money. I do it cause I love it. but meh anyway, I finally did actually make some friends with girls. friends, I use that term VERY loosely. I also accidentally asked out a lesbian and she said no. and yeah. These friends who are girls, love to use me. They ignore all my texts, ignore me and treat me like shit in real life. and also love to ask for money. Im not being a sexist, this is personal experience. This is real life. This is what happened to me. IM TRYING NOT TO GENERALIZE. but wow am I an unlucky guy? or is that normal? well 2 of these girls said that I should make a tinder, and I told them... I already have one, and nobody matchs with me. they said ok, lets make you one than, took pics all that. still no matchs, and also these girls constantly ignore me, and belittle me at times, they seem to almost rub their sex lives in my face? saying things like ""when im horny, I just find some hot guys online and fuck them sometimes?"" Ok. its not that easy for me. and im the entitled one? because you guys reading this esspeccially if your a woman ur first thing is ""longnightofsolace is entitled incel"" nah man, just give me a chance here. They tell me how easy it is to meet guys and stuff, and im just sitting there telling them, ""its not that easy for guys like me."" they even used my accounts and tried to get me dates and never never never did I ever get one. also when I ask to hang out, they ask if im gonna bring weed etc. if I don't. they don't wanna chill. they'll leave me on read and tell me they are busy, than put pics with boys on their social media and just tell me they have a social life to attend to. to bad I cant be part of that. must be all my entitlement. you know? the whole incels are entitled bullshit is well, bullshit. Sure some incels seem entitled like women are supposed to worship them or something? but all I want is a chance man, and that seems impossible, or to at least be treated with respect which seems impossible as well. I eventually met this really attractive girl at work, she moved here from out of state, and she loves weed. and asked me to get her some, she was also my first kiss. she also ignores the fuck out of me constantly, treats me like dog shit, calls me names at times, rolls her eyes at me and yeah, just horrible how she treats me. shes really really attractive, and knows im a incel and I think she thinks its fun to hurt me tbh. she told me how she meets all kinds of guys to fuck online and one night stands them. (im the entitled one, reddit. I am. cause I just want a chance, that makes me entitled, LOLOLOLOLOLOL) she complained to me one time because she went 2 weeks with out sex. I told her, ""you know I never ever had sex, probably never will, yet it seems so easy for you, what if I started complaining about being a virgin, thatd be gross though wouldn't it? but I notice a girl complains about not getting dick and everyone just thinks that's ok."" she kinda ignored me for a bit after that. (again im the entitled one, fuck you reddit.) Than she started being weirdly flirty with me all the time. I NEVER, had a girl flirt with me, especially one this attractive, I have seen guys harass this girl, guys way hotter than me. and she rejects them? but she like told me she found me attractive and started treating me really nice and than one day she kissed me on the cheek. that's it. just a kiss on the cheek. that was my first kiss, cheek counts right? well now she kinda just ignores me and doesn't even talk to me at all. idk why she did that at all and probably never will. she messages me here and there telling me she ""loves me"" but I mean obviously not cause when im going through it im left on read I assume when she needs something from me ill get a text. that's that ig. I know its my looks holding me back guys. ive posted on amiugly before and all it is was ppl saying im the ugliest man alive. That they can ""see the depression in my eyes"" I look in the mirror and I cry guys. if your in a position like me. there is really no fucking hope. ive seen it all first hand, girls blowing me off for way hotter guys. ITS ALL IN THE LOOKS. If your attractive man you have it way easy, esspeccially if your a girl. if your ugly, in 2020, thats virginity dude. for life. if u want to offer advice id be glad to hear it, Im pretty depressed right now. but don't call me entitled, don't sit here and lie to me and tell me I need to ""get over it"" if you were in my shoes youd feel the same way about it. its bullshit when someone whos had sex, and gets to have it when they desire, can tell someone to just get over it. When girls are telling me, ""I get horny, I meet up guys and fuck"" do I have to show u the messages? Its bullshit when they can say that shit, than judge me when I just wish I could get a date. that one kiss was so amazing. but im to ugly for all that. that was my whole point btw, if your ugly like me, it really is over it seems like. and the rest of the world feels the same way, they'll tell ya, ""GET OVER IT."" while they go through 5 boyfriends / girlfriends a year and countless hook ups."

He's a absolute geek and I thought that a full-fledged CaH set + several expansions would make him really happy. So I hopped on the Internet and after a short research I found out I can only get him the basic set from the local stores and a shipment(for the cool expansions) from CaH's office in USA would cost ridiculously much to circle half the globe. So after several days of desperation and further research I found out a seller, who presumably had all expansions of the game. In the passion of the moment of gifting my best busd such experience it never went through my mind that I might be scammed. Well I made the deal with the guy, payed him through one of the recently-emerged payment platforms and he then proceeded to stop all contact to me - I was utterly devastated as I had saved those funds especially for my friend for a long time. I turned to to the company but they pointed out to me that its clearly written in the T&amp;C that all transactions within their system are final and irreversible. So, fast forward couple of months, yesterday, due to really unforseen and unimaginably coincidental circumstances, I came across the credit card info of this guy. Since I live a moderately normal life my family in Eastern Europe, after I lost that 400 EUR(which I saved for a long time since I knew my friend was turning 20) I didn't have pretty much anything left and shamefully apologised to him for not gifting him anything. Now, empowered by the newly-obtained information, I would only like to get back my money. However, although being relatively tech-savvy, I would like some guidance on how I can make a payment or take my funds back from the card, without getting on the authorities radar. A VPN would probably be must-have, but I'm sure that there's more than meets the eye. I know that many of you won't think that's what I need to do, but I lost money I saved for over a half a year, each day not eating so I can collect them for a friend. If someone is willing to help, it would be my pleasure to listen to all he/she has to say. To make things even clearer, I reached out to the police, however, due to being in Eastern Europe, our cyber-crime department is practically non-existent and they straight up denied to help me and that's why I'm taking this matter into my hands."

I have been having some problems lately. I got into what I thought was a string of bad relationships. This has been going on for about 4 years now. The situations all escalated and ended with varying degrees of sexual assault or physical assault. Some of my most vulnerable moments got recorded on video without me knowing it and shared. I've endured endless emotional abuse and have also been drugged. But then it turned out that the men all knew each other. And it gets worse. After finding out that they all knew each other, I thought...okay the internet exists...is it really that surprising that sexual predators network? But I was thinking about how it was going and it seemed like there was something even more off than that about it. I can't even online date anymore because they show up or one of their chronies show up. A little while ago I fought off an attack and the guy who attacked me dropped a hint that they had sent him. They were doing all kinds of other stuff to harass me including having some random guy show up at work when I was outside on a smoke break to ask me how it felt when ""name ommitted"" raped me. Anyway, I did some sleuthing. They actually go beyond that. I got into someone's email. It turned out one of the guys who sexually assaulted me was actually forced to do it and didn't even want to. It turned out that they are actually a decent sized group of guys and that there are at least two police officers involved. It turned out that they target emotionally vulnerable or younger isolated gay men. Their end goal is literally to isolate the victims, have them end up homeless or messed up and KILL THEMSELVES. They drive people to suicide. I saw a whole bunch of sick disgusting stuff I wish I hadn't seen in this guys email account. I won't list it here. I wasn't super keen on going to the police since there are members of the poloce force involved. And one of them...badadada works in the fucking sex crimes unit! I'm not super keen on getting counseling because at least one of the men works in mental health. I don't have a family and I lost most of my friends as this was going on - not really directly because of the guys but because my friends didn't care the first time I was raped and went to them for help. So, anyway, they have kept playing the same tricks for the last while and have shared information about me amongst themselves. They all know what I dress like and where I work and all that stuff. Basically, what I have done, is downloaded and made copies of all the content from the email and shipped a thumb drive off to an old friend from back home. It wasn't just content from the email, there were usernames and passwords to several other sites and services being used to share all kinds of sick material. So that if anything happens to me there's a backup plan. They go to cops with thumb drive content in another city. I then let one of them know that I had gotten a hold of the content. He demanded proof and I didn't give direct proof because I don't know how that would work legally where I've now committed a cyber crime but I paraphrased some of the conversations they had had. I also described some details of some of the videos I found. He asked what I wanted from him. I told him I wanted to be left alone. That I wouldn't do anything with the information I have. The conversation of course ended with him backtracking and calling me crazy. Because he can't admit anything or there would be problems for him and his crew. So I have a stack of evidence that I won't really use unless it gets to a point where my life is in danger (directly). Because if only some of them go down I will be totally dead in the water. I just had to cut off this one guy who I thought was my friend because I caught some hints that he was involved. Not surprising since we know a few of the same people. So I guess we're at a stalemate. The one benefit I have is that they deliberately keep their actions limited to covert abuse for the most part and the sexual assaults are limited to situations where it could be construed as an intimate partner issue or where it's in a grey area or where the victim is so down that they have nothing they can do and no support. So essentially I'm banking on just living my life now and enjoying the small things. I figure I have more than enough dirt that the risk of bothering me won't be worth the reward. So...what do I do from here? Do you think I'll be left alone? Do I keep my guard up forever? Do I move to a new place? Would moving even help? The internet is vast and a couple of their friends are in other places. Or do I just live life as normal, make some new friends, and just enjoy the good things while keeping an eye out for the worst? Pretend it never happened and move on? I'm also worried they will wait until I let my guard down and then pounce again. Any advice would be appreciated. I know this sounds like made up crap but trust me that's exactly what they bank on. As per their emails they pretty much brainstorm ways to make people think they are crazy or make them look like the crazy ones etc. Please don't comment just to say that you don't believe me. I need good honest advice from helpful people."
13,cyber crime,Advice,Do I have enough to go to the police for a cyber harrassment charge (AU)? link to pics in text...,1,dp3qdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dp3qdr/do_i_have_enough_to_go_to_the_police_for_a_cyber/,2019-10-30 19:09:29,"The other day I was contacted by someone who sent me a message basically describing and mocking a situation that had occurred last sem and I posted for advice on mental health subreddits (long story short both my grandparents passed away and I fell into the worst depressive episode and lived in an isolated situation with students who didn't speak english and fake friends who didn't include me outside of uni). I'm sort of ashamed of being lonely and venting that but not so much now as my situation is the opposite and I'm really happy :)) My situation drastically changed this sem and I am much happier and have heaps of friends who enjoy my company and we do lots together. I am also dating a great guy. However, last year I was coerced by a guy that seemed really nice and genuine and sweet, into having sex with him after three months of talking, I'm not ashamed of that fact as its a normal aspect of life. But just found out through this message that he had taken an explicit video from behind when I was not aware and shared it to not only his friends but people in our class. To have your trust betrayed like that is crushing. I stopped talking to him not long after but he stalked me on insta with different accounts when I blocked him and got his best friend to contact me and send videos until I blocked him too. I'm going to see the police about that as it is clearly a revenge porn crime and luckily new laws have been brought into my state to combat this. However, this person (I have a pretty good idea who it is as it would have been someone we sat with first semester when it happened and the only other people were gay and one is overseas and not really friends) soon revealed themselves as a friend of this guy and stated that at his recent birthday party, he had brought this video out and other images that I posted a long time ago anonymously and forgot about on normal nudes to show weight loss progress when I was in a manic state and I'm ashamed of since I didn't delete them around the time I lost my grandma(I don't know how he found the account unless the original guy saw my username) and showed them to new friends of this guy who he met after I stopped speaking and who also share a class with me. He stated that the guy brought me up at his party (I don't know why as we are done and haven't spoken for 1 year and a bit) and that the harrasser showed them the video and photos. He even stated that my face is identifiable but it would have to be the video and not the pics as I never showed my face. He kept asking for me to post more as well as he said he got himself off over the others which is degrading for me. I've just tried to ignore him and his messages but each day (four days now) he sends a new, harrassing one that gets increasingly worse to bait me. I do know that even if he deletes his account it will be stored in Reddits system with his ip address but I've taken screenshots just in case (shown below, sorry for all the redacts but there was a bit of personal information in it) Is this enough to go to the police for a harrassment/cyberbullying claim? I really don't know what to do and I'm sick of it and I don't know how anyone could be so sociopathic and cruel. I think I will also tell him that the video from his friend was non-consensual and I'm going to the police over it and hopefully that will take him down a notch and give him some of the experience I have had and he won't be so smug revealing stuff like that without doing his research.

Call her out and ask to leave her alone, Monika will take that as an attack and her friends will attack girlfiend via cyber bullying Ignore stalker still wins. My suggestion is that she convinces Monika friends that shes a terrible person but girlfiend claims shell get a new group of groupies. Monika(20) is dating a 14 year old girl and even took explicit nudes of her in the shower(evidence of a sexual crime). I told girlfiend to go to the police and shes doesnt want to get them involved and said something along the lines it was a sisterly relationship.

So a friend messaged me because I'm kinda good with computers; she wanted to know if I could help her delete photos of a friend of hers on someone else's computer. I can't, but I'd like to help her out if I can. Apparently, friend of the friend (FoF) sent this guy nudes when she was in her early teens. He somehow still has them, and now he's blackmailing her with them. Apparently he has nudes of a lot of other girls too, and has leaked theirs before, plus he showed FoF proof that he does have the nudes, so it's legit. And he's older than us - an army intelligence official of sorts in their country right now (I don't live there), which he's using as further leverage - he claims to be able to hack into a lot of stuff and find out information about friend and FoF. FoF has screenshots of him saying all of this. So far, I've been urging friend to take it to the police in their country. But their online cyber crime division doesn't seem to want to pick up the phone, and a police complaint must be done by going there in person, something FoF doesn't want to do because she's scared it'll affect the family's reputation if she got found out and/or the nudes leaked. Is there any other recourse for them? I can't do much, if anything at all, other than to tell friend what might be a good idea. "

But somebody has been stalking me over the internet since last year. It started after I blocked them for leaving a rude comment under a video I posted. They got EXTREMELY pissed that I blocked them (despite me not knowing them in person or talking to them much) and send me a long paragraph telling me they loved me and I abandoned them, calling me a whore and a lot of hurtful things. I panicked and deleted my account because I have anxiety issues and wanted to just make it stop. After that, they sent me a message on my personal blog telling me I should kill myself and that I'm worthless and all this shit. So I deleted that blog, and layed low on social media. A couple months after that, they found me again through an account I had no pictures on or my real name saying the same things, except they threatened to doxx me and said more nastier insults. After that, they hacked into a DEACTIVATED account of mine somehow and sent pictures of me smoking to my Mom. Then everything stopped for a couple of months. Then this person sent a message to my friend in March saying that if I didn't commit suicide within 5 months he would sent the swat team to my house. A week ago, two cops came to my house saying I apparently threatened to shoot up and bomb the school. Thankfully they didn't sent a swat team because my house has no violent history and nobody here owns a gun. I know he sent in that threat pretending to be me. I've been working with a cop who's apparently good with cyber crime cases but they haven't been much help because I don't know much about this person so it's hard for them to track him down. I've been very stressed, paranoid and anxious and I need advice because I feel helpless. This has been messing with my mental state a lot. "

I apologize. I can not do this shit anymore guys. I have no where to turn. I'm in a bad situation right now. Long story short, there's a guy who is cyber stalking and harassing me with malicious intent. And it's fucking me up a lot. I can't reveal too many details without giving myself away, cause that would put me at more risk, but I'll try to explain this. There was a friend who I made over the internet. We both had the same goal to start a band and become famous musicians. My videos started to get way more views and attention than his (mainly because I am a female) even though I had been playing for less longer, and he told me he was jealous and couldn't feel happy for me. His comments were less and less supportive, and more criticising than anything, even though I supported HIM no matter what. I blocked him. Fast forward to 5 months later. I get a whole long message from him where he tells me he really loved me, that I abandoned him and gave him PSTD. He calls me an attention whore and all this stuff and tells me I'll never make it as a musician. Then he blocks me so I couldn't respond. I deleted my Facebook account (which is the account where I was getting thousands of views on each video and was getting successful). I made another one under the same name. He finds me on my personal account on Tumblr, and says worst things on anon. He called me an ugly whore, retarded, asked me why I hadn't killed myself yet, tells me I deserve to get ran over by a train, and says I deserve every bad that ever happened to me (which stung a lot cause I used to tell him everything that went on in my life and I had so much awful shit happen.) He also found my account on Instagram and wrote hate comments. I never realized until recently that it was him though. I never retaliated in any way. All I had done was block him. But I deleted that tumblr account and changed the url and username on Facebook. I had no pictures of me public, and I had my settings very private. But I made only one post public, which is where I was talking about another musician. He shared that post and said even WORST things as a caption. He told me I should hang myself and slit my wrists, he called me fat and ugly, he said that well respected musicians at where ever he lives think I suck so I should stop trying, he called me talentless, and just kept saying I should kill myself. He also threatened to release my personal information if I tried anything and called me pathetic, and used my real name on that post. I'm genuinely scared and I can't get help from anybody. He lives somewhere in another country. I've tried the police and reporting it to an internet crime thing but they haven't done jack shit or responded to me. I feel genuinely afraid and fucking helpless. I am not suicidal but if I died right now, I wouldn't mind at all. He knows everything about me but the only thing I have is a name and an old username of his. I just wish I never blocked him in the first place. I was on a successful path and gaining fans but I've had to delete everything and hide cause of this. Tdrl; ex internet friend is stalking and harassing me, and I can't do shit about it. Ive had to delete everything. I've already tried contacting the authorities but they didn't do anything. This is problematic for me cause I actually was gaining internet success and fans as a musician and I want to continue chasing my dreams but this is a big obstacle for me at the moment. "
21,cyber crime,Advice,Adult Cyber Stalking &amp; Harassment,3,739t9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/739t9e/adult_cyber_stalking_harassment/,2017-09-30 04:40:00,"Hi all, my boyfriend and I need help. Over the past year we have been cyber stalked and bullied. At first it was harmless, someone we had no idea was posting rude comments on our Instagram accounts. We always ignored it, reported the profile, and then made our accounts private. It then turned into this person creating fake profiles of my boyfriend and I and tagging us in these fake profiles or pictures. This person had taken screenshots of our pictures and started using them on their fake profile. Eventually what was happening every 3 months then became every month, and now it's every week or sometimes daily. Once it started getting more aggressive this person started posting pictures of herself and short forms of her name, eventually revealing her full name entirely. Most of her posts never make any sense like she has a mental illness and is delusional and obsessive. This was finally confirmed in one of her posts about herself where she admits to being diagnosed with Schizophrenia and having recently been arrested by the police for sleeping on a park bench and having a visa that expired. Yes, she's an immigrant in Canada and has been living here without a visa. More to come on that. I will comment that during this entire time period we have reported this to all social media sites and the police. In which social media, such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram reported there wasn't anything they could do unless we sought police/legal assistance; which now brings us to our case file we opened with the police. The Toronto (Ontario, Canada) Police Cyber Department have done very little to help with this situation in fact stating ""they are not here to police social media"" and that ""just because we are offended by a few comments or posts, doesn't justify harassment or a crime"". So the police don't think impersonating us, slandering our names by calling us racists, gay, lesbians, and many more things is harassment or a crime? I do. It matters that she is impersonating us and threatening us publicly. Again, I've gotten a bit side tracked and I haven't given all the details so now I'm going to go back to the beginning... This is someone my boyfriend talked to online briefly and when she started saying awkward and random things he cut off communication. So going down the line, I come in to the picture and she's kept tabs on him. Well, she's clearly upset that he didn't end up with her and is now with me. To be honest, the way she attacks anyone about anything it seems this is more just an obsession in general with all our lives than really it is with him. What may have started with him has grown to much more in her mind. So now you're thinking why don't I just delete social media all together? Ahh but I have, I've deleted all my social media and now she's posting things on a daily basis tagging our friends, family, and even our work places. To make matters worse, she's tagging my boyfriend's ex girlfriend and ex wife. Even better right? Dealing with an obsessed woman isn't enough, we need his ex's in the picture too. So here we are, off social media and it isn't stopping. The most recent attack on twitter shows she is impersonating me and his ex-girlfriend and has tagged both our work, colleagues, and for me, some of my clients. We both have reported this to the police. In fact, my boyfriend's ex girlfriend's detective on the case she has now opened up was able to confirm a few things for us. The name she had been posting was in fact her, and she was in fact arrested and thought to be mentally ill. When she was arrested she was also deported back to the Philippines. It's at least comforting to know there is no physical threat, but it also explains why the harassment has increased as she is now in her home country, likely back in her own home with her family, and has the ability to be online whenever she wants. There are so many details to this story, so I'll leave it at this and answer anything that comes up in the thread. Right now, we just have no idea what to do. The fact that this is impacting our careers/workplace now is disgusting. This whole thing confuses me and really has opened up the question that there is very little that can be done with adult cyber stalking. This is such a prevalent issue with young children and teenagers, so no one ever really thinks it can happen to adults or that it doesn't matter as much, but it does. No form of cyber stalking or harassment to anyone of any age, race, gender, or any demographic characteristic should be tolerated. Yours truly, Frustrated and feeling hopeless"

24,cyber crime,Advice,Tips to Protect Yourself from Cyber Crime,1,3dzio6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3dzio6/tips_to_protect_yourself_from_cyber_crime/,2015-07-21 06:12:57,"In todays world, nearly everything we do is governed by computer chips and wires connecting the whole world together. You do your banking, shopping, emailing, work  almost everything you do is vulnerable to an online threat. PCs, laptop, tablets, and smart phones; there are even smart glasses, all of these things are vulnerable to cyber criminals and cyber terrorists looking to take advantage of people and steal their money, personal information, or invade their privacy. Up until now it is estimated that cyber crime has cost the world a total of 100 billion dollars! Many of these crimes are aimed against governments and large corporations but even worse an astounding number of them are aimed at people just like you and me; predators on the internet search for vulnerable people or easy servers to hack; there are schemes and schemers everywhere, thats why its essential to protect yourself. The first thing to watch out for is an email virus, more specifically a worm. These worms are usually found in junk mail and if a user opens the attachment it can grant backdoor access to a computer granting somebody else remote access as well as the ability to control it. The lesson here being to never click strange links or open unknown email attachments. The next thing on the list to be aware of is social media. Things like Facebook and Twitter accounts are great ways for criminals to get their hands on your information. Many people unwittingly transfer their information to cyber criminals. Oversharing can not only allow crimes to happen online, it can also be used to carry out real world crimes. A recent survey of home-owners revealed that 35% of users post their vacation plans on social media; availability to this type of information helps criminals achieve their motives easily. So, that being said, always be aware of who you are talking with on any kind of social media. The next tip to keep in mind, no matter how paranoid it sounds, is to always know who is using your computer; dont let kids or guests in the house on to your computer with confidential information on it. Also, similar to this, always keep things password protected, encrypted, and never allow a website or your computer to a remember the password, always enter it manually and even more important dont ever use the same password for more than one different thing. Also, be aware of Flashplayer and many of the pop-ups that you allow onto your computer; flash pop-ups are shown to be some of the most dangerous weapons in a cyber criminals arsenal; one click is all it could take to infect your computer and compromise everything. Our final tip to protect yourself from cyber crime would be to always make sure that your computer always has the best virus protection and anti malware software possible. Adhering to all of these steps doesnt guarantee complete protection but a good balance between security and connectivity will help fight the malice of cyber crimes.
