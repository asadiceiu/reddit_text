An unauthenticated, unauthorized attacker sending a specially crafted MMS to a vulnerable phone can trigger a heap-based buffer overflow in the Quram image codec leading to an arbitrary remote code execution (RCE) without any user interaction. The Samsung ID is SVE-2020-16747. Does LineageOS even have this image codec? Should Samsung Galaxy (post 2014) owners running LineageOS be worried?"

9,CVE,LineageOS,Wrong information on the CVE pages gives LineageOS a bad name,38,771c2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/LineageOS/comments/771c2g/wrong_information_on_the_cve_pages_gives/,2017-10-18 07:20:40,"With the announcement of the KRACK vulnerability, some users started looking for an ""up to date"" Android. LineageOS is an obvious option and it was recommended on news comments, reddit posts, forum threads, hacker news, etc. Sadly, some of the comments I saw were about the CVE portal and the ""lack of security patches"". Many don't know that the information displayed is incorrect and they end up with a wrong idea about LineageOS. Even worse: some will keep using the insecure system they have. I like the CVE portal - transparency is good! - but the information needs to be correct (same with the status page). I've seen a maintainer complaining on XDA (oneplus2?) about something being broken. Perhaps changes need to be made so maintainers start updating their pages as well? I'm not a developer and can't help with code, but I can give feedback :-P I think this is something that should be improved in the future. Thanks for all your hard work."

My question is if anyone knows if a fixed bcm firmware blob has been released that can be tried with the N10 (and other devices), or should we just consider our device completely open and pwnable (keep wifi off). IF so, does that then mean that support for these devices has to be discontinued on official builds simply because we know we can't patch this device completely without the new firmware?"
