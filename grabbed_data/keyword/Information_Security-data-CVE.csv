0,CVE,Information_Security,Dissertation thought - using CVSS database APIs to create a live risk assessment ..?,1,ekucnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Information_Security/comments/ekucnu/dissertation_thought_using_cvss_database_apis_to/,2020-01-07 00:47:21,"I am a student in my placement year, I want to think about my dissertation for next year, and would love to know the flaws of this idea as my knowledge is limited. So this would be targeted to small companies that cant afford a solution like tenable: A risk assessment which will include vulnerabilities (CVE) and the risk of these being exploited. Could you set up APIs to get current CVSS scoring that can automatically update the risk level based on CVSS? And alert that action is required - and potentially pull what actions are required to reduce the risk?"

A security architect whom will remain anonymous did a threat analysis for his company, I'm going to give the bottom line here. Bottom line: Risk is currently low.  The source article is the security firm that found it, and it also is a promotion for their WAF product.  Citrix did publish a [mitigation](URL a few days before the news broke, and recommended that everyone apply it if you're running an impacted version.  No evidence suggests that any exploit has been published, nor is there any evidence the exploit has been used in any attacks.  Because the [mitigation](URL source code published by Citrix has conditions (&amp;/OR statements) related to a VPN, **there is a mistaken belief in the articles it only applies if you are using a VPN.** This doesn't seem to be the case the mitigation source code implies the flaw may be in the SSL VPN module, but does not rule out that the flaw could be exploited without the module being on."

It is possible to read arbitrary files outside the root directory of the web server. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely by a crafted URL without credentials, with / or \\ or ./ or .\\ as a directory\-traversal pattern to TCP port 8667. An attacker can make use of this vulnerability to step out of the root directory and access other parts of the file system. This might give the attacker the ability to view restricted files, which could provide the attacker with more information required to further compromise the system. \[Additional Information\] &gt;nmap \-p T:8667 \-Pn your\_vSpace\_server &gt; &gt;Nmap scan report for your\_vSpace\_server \(x.x.x.x\) Host is up \(0.044s latency\). &gt; &gt;PORT STATE SERVICE 8667/tcp open unknown &gt; &gt;URL &gt; &gt;URL &gt; &gt;URL &gt; &gt;URL \[Vulnerability Type\] Directory Traversal \[Vendor of Product\] NComputing \[Affected Product Code Base\] vSpace  Pro 10 vSpace  Pro 11 \[Affected Component\] NcMonitorServer.exe TCP 8667 NC Monitor Server: Health monitoring agents connect to it to provide collected data \[Attack Type\] Remote \[Impact Information Disclosure\] True \[Discoverer\] Javier Bernardo  [Kwell.net](URL email: [javier@kwell.net](URL \[References\] [URL [URL [URL [URL"
