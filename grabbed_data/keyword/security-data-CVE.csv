0,CVE,security,Responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities where author probably doesn't have the ability to address the issues,1,fi5j1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/fi5j1w/responsible_disclosure_of_vulnerabilities_where/,2020-03-14 06:44:36,"I was recently evaluating a software to use for our organization. I had a look at the code (PHP) and it it is littered with vulnerabilities. I was able to do a XSS POC within 10 mins of looking at the code. Within an hour I found a dozen of XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities. I informed the author a week ago. After initially refuting the issue the author stopped responding. There have been no updates to the software since. The thing is the code looks like straight from the 90s. MySQL/PHP in HTML, $\_GET straight embedded in the template, $\_GET straight embedded in SQL queries, tons of duplication, ... It's a total mess. As far as I can tell it has been around in this state for a decade. The only way to fix this would be to completely rewrite the system (\~45k lines of code). The system is widely used (forum has 1000s of posts/ product is one of the top search results for the use case). The system is used to manage sensitive customer information. The question is what would be a recommended approach to disclose/approach this. Looking at the code I don't think the author has the ability to rewrite the system in a secure manner. The system has been around for a long time and by the looks of it there are no exploits in he wild (there was one CVE a few years ago with exploits but the particular issue has been fixed since). I don't have the time/expertise to support someone to rewrite their commercial product. Should I just ignore it? Or should I give the author x days to fix and then disclose? Or is there some middle ground?"

I have a task on my job that I don't know how to tackle. There was a breach on an old server at my job. Someone got a remote access to a user in that machine (CentOS 7) and: created a cron job inside the user folder; that cron job starts a binary file; that binary file tried to connect to a certain IP address (digital ocean); that binary file was sitting at /tmp/.java/.java/. The process would then take over CPU usage. I scanned the file and didn't find anything, until I decompressed it with UPX. Then online antiviruses recognized it as Linux/Bitcoinminer.c. The IP address when accessed through web gave a message ""proxy miner is on"" or something like that. That is, the thing itself looked harmless to an extent. Management tasked me with listing all vulnerabilities in that machine, which I did. The version of things in that server were so old that some parts had 3 pages of entries from CVE. They asked if I could pinpoint which vulnerability was used to get the access and I was honest and said I didn't.

38,CVE,security,What's the logic for Intel/AMD (from their stand point of view) to include ME/PSP on EVERY single modern CPU?,56,6oydoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/security/comments/6oydoy/whats_the_logic_for_intelamd_from_their_stand/,2017-07-23 10:15:24,"TL;DR: Why does ME/PSP exist on **every** (not just some) modern CPU, why doesn't Intel/AMD give us at least an option? Intel ME / AMD PSP are basically small auxiliary CPU right beside the main CPU. It has access to everything on your computer, everything: hdd/ssd/usb, data, memory, screen, keyboard, mouse and camera. It can even wake up your computer when it is powered off (but still connected to wall and Ethernet). The user won't know when or what it is currently running or sending/receiving data to/from whom, nor can the user disable it in anyway (other than flashing [me_cleaner](URL / libreboot). By design, it is a backdoor, and it's on all Intel CPUs since 2008 and AMD CPUs since 2013. It doesn't matter if you're running firewall apps (at the App layer), or if you're running windows or Linux or BSD (at the OS layer), because [down below at the hardware layer you have a backdoor](URL and there can be ways to trick you to disclose encryption keys/passwords. I get it that some big organization want to control their computers remotely, and ME/PSP makes it possible and easy. Sure! But why doesn't Intel/AMD just make ""ME"" / ""PSP"" editions specifically designed for them? Why do the billions of us average consumers, who most likely don't need remote administration, also have no options but to use these CPUs/Motherboards with such low level security risks? Could someone please ELI5 what's the logic from Intel/AMD's stand point of view that they have to include ME/PSP on **every single** one of their CPUs? Is it because of economy of scale that producing a non-ME/PSP version will cause such undue hardship that they simply cannot do this to be profitable? Or is it because they don't want their big buyers end up buying thousands of wrong CPUs when they actually need ME/PSP? But just like any other big B2B purchases, there is expectation that both the sellers/buyers should do their own due diligence. I can't imagine an admin who is professional enough to manage a 1-million-CPU data centre will order to buy non-ME/PSP CPUs (if such thing exists). I also can't imagine someone selling 5000 CPUs to a big corporation without confirming remote admin is a feature they need. I don't think Intel/PSP designed ME/PSP with malicious intent, and I really don't like to buy the conspiracy theory (even though [FBI has ordered Apple to include backdoor](URL and I would really like to trust Intel/AMD, but aren't their codes trustworthy? The me_cleaner's author has reverse-engineered only 1% of the ME code and already [found bugs](URL Not to mention [in May 2017 the AMT part of ME has exposed computers that run it](URL Although Intel released a fix, few vendors have applied the fix to motherboards made 2 years ago. Once the ME/PSP are compromised, billions of computers won't get a fix. For those that do, how many consumers are technical enough to flash the firmware? The most frustrating thing is, no matter how hard you try with your security practice (at the software/OS level), ME/PSP makes them nearly useless. A potential hacker will have slightly harder time to get your data, but getting it isn't impossible: one could just wait til you decrypt the encrypted harddrive (because you don't know someone is watching) and voila. At least we have the [me_cleaner](URL and coreboot / libreboot projects. Or perhaps we could move to VIA x86? Or perhaps a future Raspberry Pi 4 or some other opensource SoCs can finally serve as a general-purpose computer? I sincerely wish I had just read too many paranoid, fear-mongering, tinfoil-wearing articles, or perhaps is ME/PSP really a time-bomb that will be the security breach of the decade? I'm ready to flash my BIOS with me_cleaner, and I'm pretty sure I'll brick at least some of my motherboards learning how. lol "
