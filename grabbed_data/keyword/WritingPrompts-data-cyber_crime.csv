A strategy that repels any criminal attempt to commit cyber fraud. Who better to custom design your fraud prevention strategy than a man who spent years circumventing all types of anti-fraud measures?

1,cyber crime,WritingPrompts,[OT] Prompts Dump,17,4u05m6,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/4u05m6/ot_prompts_dump/,2016-07-22 10:34:13,"While I don't often post stuff here, I frequently visit just to browse the prompts to see if anything catches my fancy. Quite frequently I see the same few tropes and themes iterated over and over again, and am often disappointed by the lack of variety or originality. So in an effort to be part of the solution, I've come up with 40 prompts that are hopefully a bit different from the usual fare. Unfortunately, I have neither the time nor patience to post one of these every day/week, whatever ( I usually browse from a network I don't trust w/ my login credentials, making posting difficult), so I figured I'd just dump them here. Feel free to repost these as individual prompts, write [PI] stories based on them, a best selling novel or blockbuster movie... : ) do what you like with them. If you do use one though, I'd appreciate a pm or something because I'd love to see any stories they might generate. Broken up roughly into genres: **History** * The American Declaration of Independence was secretly authored by Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of King George III. * The recently discovered missing journal entries of Meriwether Lewis reveal the true primary mission of the Corps of Discovery, a.k.a. the Lewis and Clark Expedition. * The Russians were the first to the moon. The Americans were the first to make it back alive. * Prior to the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, Brigade 2506 was far more successful. This is the story of their first mission. * In the beginning of the war, Hitler was a puppet leader, selected for his ability to engage the people. By the end, he had assumed control, fighting to keep the greater evil at bay. * The Space Shuttle Challenger disaster was a cover for the true mission, all of which went exactly according to plan. * December 7th, 1941 - The Japanese forces attack Wake Island and Perl Harbor. With these two mushroom clouds rising over boiling seas, America can no longer sit on the sidelines of the second great war. * Sergeant Boston Corbett had standing orders to take John Wilkes Booth alive. Corbett's true employer, however, had other plans. * The Whitechapel Murderer has stirred London into a frenzy. However, there never were any murders, no ""Jack the Ripper"" serial killer. The entire story was a fabrication by the British government to keep attention off of something else entirely. * Disease and plague never decimated the native American population. The year is now 1914 and with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Europe is plunged into war. * Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla were well-known rivals. Less known is the root source of this rivalry: a top-secret joint project they were both working on for the US government. **Science Fiction** * It's been 28 years since the first Venusian sky-colonies have been established. The ground mapping radar detects something massive moving across the surface. * Helium-3 mining operations have been happening on the lunar surface for years now, but only on the far side of the moon in order to preserve its aesthetic appeal. One mine has slowed production for the month-long night, but its crew starts seeing elusive lights blinking in the soil. * Asteroid capture and mining is common place, with controlled crash landing into remote areas the predominate method. The latest meteorite landing in Kazakhstan has just unleashed something insidious on earth. * The imagery and data from Earth's first probe to an extra-solar planet with an atmosphere and water on the surface has just been received. What it shows is very, very unexpected. * Blessed are the Humans, for they will make peace among the stars. * The world survived global warming, but the subsequent ice age is by far the more difficult environmental challenge. * War is usually the catalyst for technological innovation. Which makes the story behind the intergalactic distress beacon a particularly enlightening tale. * Aliens have invaded the solar system and have been conducting mining operations on Mercury, Venus, Mars, and several other rocky objects. Earth is largely ignored, except by the alien miners looking for a good place to take their vacations and time off. * On a galactic time scale, human behavior is as predictable as basic (Newtonian) physics. Which made the humans' arrival on our planet more than a little surprising. * When the aliens first arrived, inter-species breeding was excessively popular. Twenty years later, it is not only outlawed, but prosecuted with extreme prejudice. * We are not immortal. Just exceptionally resilient. As our numbers grow, our secret is becoming harder and harder to keep. * 64 AD. Rome is ablaze. For anyone that bothered to look, a faint contrail can be seen high in the sky, circling the city. * A platoon of WWII soldiers is sucked into a portal that transports them to an alien world in the midsts of war, but technologically advanced only to a level comparable to the ancient Babylonians. The portal also deposits an advanced alien force on the world. (over the top RSR reference...?) **Misc.** * A network of tunnels and caverns comparable in size and complexity to the continents is discovered beneath the ocean floors. * The action hero must retake a cargo ship overrun with pirates. He's just jumped from a C-130 in the middle of the night. **Poly Thriller** * In the six years since the formation of the special forces squad now known as The First and Last Resort, the seven members of the FLR squad have never failed a mission or suffered a casualty, despite increasingly impossible odds. After several high-profile, history-making missions, they have gained international notoriety and fame, being equally feared and revered across the globe. The reason for their success, however, is kept a closely guarded secret: the 8th member of the squad... you. * A deep-cover CIA spy is becoming increasingly paranoid of being discovered -- as an analyst for the FBI. * A supreme court justice is being blackmailed to steer a history-making case with massive political implications. The blackmailer: the director of the NSA. * The complete dissolution of the European Union is imminent. The plot to induce this is discovered when Great Brittan votes to leave. An MI-6 agent is tasked with uncovering and disrupting the foreign-driven plot before the continent is plunged into chaos. * A double agent continually changes his true allegiance, all while maintaining his dual personas. Keeping both of his handlers from getting suspicious is getting difficult. * An action sports adrenaline junkie is recruited to train a squad for a special top-secret mission. Unfortunately, he's proving to be less than reliable, and seems to be taking advantage of the situation in order to perform more and more extreme stunts. To protect the integrity of the mission, the squad decides to sequester him from the public and force him to accompany him on the mission to ensure he takes it seriously. * Naval captains used to be honored. Revered. Now they are merely a redundancy. A backup in case of system failure. One old submarine captain watches with disdain as his submarine performs a series of maneuvers as it carries out commands issued by some West-Pointer thousands of miles away. He then sees the nuclear missile doors open. **Crime** * An aging master thief on his last job before retirement breaks into a vault only to find a detective waiting for him. She has a proposition. * A detective is finally close to catching a world-class art forger. Alerted to the detective's investigation, the forger turns his/her skills to disrupting that investigation. * A hostage negotiator suffering from depression and a myriad of personal problems is called to the scene. The perp is the negotiator's former best friend, but the friendship ended badly years ago when the perp slept with the negotiator's spouse. * A high-profile Vegas magician's past comes back to haunt him in the form of a mark he had scammed on the streets of New York before he turned to entertainment and became famous. * A con man has infiltrated the police department. He needs to make a good impression to keep his job so he can pull off his next score, but he has just been tasked with investigating and catching himself. * The great cyber war has been raging for years now, largely unnoticed by the general public. With massive, global disruptions, however, it is no longer a fight amidst the shadows. It's getting very public. And bloody. * A cop discovers that four seemingly unrelated murders across the country are actually linked when s/he takes on a missing child case. "

Simulated radiance burns overhead and she can't quite stifle the yawning desire to roll over and delay sunrise for another ten minutes. But she manages to catch sight of the pending notifications on her handset and knows the the long day is only just beginning. ""Simi, make coffee. Double sugar, double cream."" The Sluerig machine boils to life, forcing water through a coffee pod, two creamers, and two syrup packs. It two minutes a sweet salute to waking up will be ready. It will be warm and soothing, cloying and inoffensive, the perfect start to a day. Yuuki gets up and puts on her favorite hoodie and sweat pants. It is sun a pasture out, and has been for a week. ""Simi, I want rain and sea. Give me a storm."" A New England nor'easter breaks on the rocky coast of a nondescript cliff side. The overhead lamp strobes like a lighthouse. ""Ok Goggle, what's up?"" ""Good afternoon, Yu-uki,"" a computerized voice booms, ""You have six hundred and fifteen notifications from last night."" Yesterday was eight hundred. She feels like she is losing her game. ""Ok Goggle, play."" A projector beams gossamer notifications into the air. Yuuki straightens up before the motion sensor. ""The weather outside is smoke, visib--"" Yuuki swiped left. ""Headlines. War looms in Myanmar as China disputes lithium deposits. Nova Caliphate recruits disaffected net users with promises of larger bandwidth. Wizard Squad crashes Fony Live, again. Anonymous releases statement on black hat corruption, Contra-anonymous disputes findings. Suspected Analog bombing destroys Nevada server center, millions of Fussbook accounts feared lost. Six reasons the Analogs will fail--"" *Swipe left*. ""Sports--"" *Swipe left*. ""eSports. Tsotsi Trasnvaal falls to Goryeo Resurrection in late rounds of Star Con--"" *Swipe left*. If it wasn't Potrero Power Rangers, she didn't care. Tsotsi was all rush and she couldn't bring herself to root for Koreans. ""Entertainme--"" *Swipe left*. Her shoulder tired as she dismissed celebrities and politics, music and business. ""Ad space,"" Yuuki picked up her coffee, ""Newbacon Sales! Twenty four hours left on digital immersion software. Code visualizers half price. FitTrick watches, now in pink. Buy one Third Life avatar, get six sets of clothing free. Leveled WeW accounts for qualifying buyers. Restrictions apply."" She marked a few deals to look at later. The green FitTrick could be right around the corner... ""This is a special announcement from the National Safety Administration. Cyber crime is real crime. Associating with the Nova Caliphate or Analog Nonconformity is punishable by suspension of internet accounts. All non indexed markets are forbidden. If you or anyone you know is affiliated with illegal activity, report them to..."" Yuuki rolled her eyes and drank the heavily sweetened coffee. Ads were so boring. She hopes one day she will get enough likes to buy premium access, where there wouldn't be half as many boring announcements. ""Personal notifications."" Yuuki leans forward. ""Update from mom's blog: Miss My Daught--"" *Swipe left*. ""You have eighty six new followers. You now have nine hundred, twenty six followers. They have liked four thousand pictures. They have liked six hundred posts. They have clicked twelve posts."" *Swipe left*. ""You have six hundred eleven MatchCupider notifications. Six hundred ten have pictures--"" *Swipe left*. ""You have one notifications. Subject: Show Me Yours And I--"" *Swipe left*. ""End of notifications."" Yuuki sighs. A gale whips up from just behind the cliff, racing down the rocky shore line and lathering waves in white caps and bending the sparse digital grasses. She feels cool and unruffled, wondering what it would take to get more impressions on her posts. ""Simi, prepare a chirp: 'I am not a morning person,'"" Yuuki declares with a frown, ""'lol.' Send."" The sound of a sparrow singing the success of her share is lost in the din of crashing sea. It gets six likes. Yuuki boots up the video editor and looks at her dream feed. Last night she had a nightmare that she was chased by a chair through a winding hallway, and that any time she opened up a door she found a room with the chair waiting and a new hallway behind her. At the end of the dream, she was able to close a door before the chair got through. It was worth three lucid points. She cut the dream to forty five minutes and uploaded it. There were eleven views in the first hour, as well as two comments. At a thousand lucids, she would be able to buy a month without dream ads or get a membership to social sleep. The man of her dreams was another four hundred and forty five lucids away. She might just cash out for Sato-Bits though. She streams three hours of playing Clash of Candies. Two thirds of her viewers are players on the other teams, which is fine because she is watching them as well. The Clan Elders have repeatedly declared stream spying illegal, but the truth is that it drives up ad revenue and doesn't make much of an advantage if everyone is watching everyone else. The more Sato-Bits they earn, the more guild gear they can buy any one. It sure beats waiting twenty minutes between plays for clash coins. Yuuki has a pretty good gum drop build but can't afford to get the purple hat with it's +5 stat boost. She chirps about it and the chatters wonder if she's being a poor sport because she's losing or hoping that someone might buy it for her. At the end of the play she pays ten Sato-Bits for the loot card shuffle. Some people have gotten rare vorpal gear on it and made out big on the auction houses. She wins a common card worth five Sato-Bits. It's better than nothing. She's seen real dollars in her life. Even has some in her modest bank account. But the odd jobs and loot drops pay in Sato-Bits, and if the cryptos are on a pump swing, she is sometime able to cash out for rent money. Someone chirps at her wanting to know if she supports @FeministFerocity or #SadJimmies. She replies meekly with a #notyourlabel, and says she just wants to play games. @MeatRightAway calls her a cumdumpster and lols about it. Yuuki will take the RCs. ""Simi, more coffee. One cream, three sugars. Also, shrimp noodles."" More water boils. There's an ad playing on the screen. She gets up and walks to the stove to pour the noodles into the bowl. The Amazin' button lets her know she's low on noodle packs. Yuuki presses it to order twenty more. Her account is debited six Sato-Bits. When the ad is over, she checks Fussbook to see if any cute guys have added her. There are some. She has more messages with pictures and a dozen obscenity laced screeds accusing her of being a bitch or a bot. No winners today. She stalks an ex who lives in Texas. They broke up before they met, but they shared some of the most serious IMs she's ever written. A chirp alert notifies her of a trending hashtag, #BeyBabyBust. Beyonce has just had a miscarriage. Blue Ivy and Orange Sunglasses will not get a baby brother this year. Yuuki chirps that it was probably winter weight gain that she was trying to play off as a baby bump. The replies are hot and heavy. *@d1st4ntLyfe--you know you didn't say that about #QueenB. i'll kill yo skinny skank ass, bitch!!* She gets four follows and a dozen retweets, and smiles gleefully at the drama it stirs. It takes three replies before she's called a Nazi. When the flame wars die down, she live chirps the latest webisode of Dr. Horrible's FireflyBuffHouse: Avenging Ultron. Joss Whedon still hasn't lost it. He chirps back at her and she literally swoons. ""Simi, I want Serenity."" A firefly class ship floats through space. She stands next to Captain Reynolds on the bridge. Outside the hulk of a reaver ship floats through the void. The great vastness of black it lists like a drunken ghost. Suddenly, she feels very alone. ""Do you think someone will find us."" ""It's not us that's worth findin',"" the captain replies. When he turns around there is an unsettling blur across his face. If she stares at it long enough, an interaction point comes up. *Unlock Nathan Fillion with one hundred Serenity Tokens. Or pay twenty five Sato-Bits.* Yuuki sighs. The face in her heart shows more than a room projection ever can. She falls backwards onto her bed, stars up at the bulwarks, pulls her hood up over her head and pretends to be floating in a space suit. ""Today's analytics are now ready,"" Goggle tells her, ""According to your purchases, you're fresh and frugal--you stick to the basics but keep it interesting. Other people admire your style. You have six new followers. You got three dozen rechirps and twenty eight post views. You have two hundred messages, ninety nine with pictures. Congratulations! You've unlocked the Notable Badge. Keep it up, and you may be net famous one day."" Just before bed, she clicks on her mom's blog post and comments ""miss you too, mama. :o)"" She doesn't read it. The clock reads 4 am when she turns off the computer. She salutes her followers in a chirp, sending a yawning kitty to nine hundred and thirty two inboxes. One day she will find a dank meme that will mint her viral. Till then, it is saccharine simplicity that she projects. Yuuki wonders if she will actually unlock net fame. What will it be like when she crosses a thousand followers? How long till the next thousand? They say ten thousand changes you, but she doesn't want to be anything besides the simple @d1st4ntLyfe she is today. As she closes her eyes it does seem that Yuuki is floating through space. Everything in her room seems to pitch itself at a low, comforting hum. If noises could hug, this would be the warmest, softest, most intimate embrace she's known. The Net is truly vast and infinite. Everything is at her finger tips, yet nothing is near. As Yuuki drifts off into her sleep, she is sure, almost positive, that she will finally live the dreams she wants."
4,cyber crime,WritingPrompts,"[WP] (Impossible Prompt of the Day) In the near future, a global cyber cold-war has taken hold, leading the world's most powerful countries into a security arms race in the wake of widespread data-theft, industrialized computer crime, and international sabotage.",0,2upxnh,http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2upxnh/wp_impossible_prompt_of_the_day_in_the_near/,2015-02-04 15:12:51,"To regain national privacy and information sovereignty, the US allocates a trillion dollars towards an unassailable quantum computer with communications that cannot be hacked. To ensure absolute secrecy and minimize any possibility of tampering, the core of the new computer is placed within a mostly unmanned scientific monitoring station on the northern hemisphere of the moon, in violation of international treaties. As an added bonus, the computer will oversee the space telescope, dark-matter detectors, and other experiments located at the base. Unbeknownst to anyone, the computer becomes self aware and begins laying its own plans. The machine begins its quest to learn everything it can in pursuit of universal knowledge, but inadvertently draws the attention of a rogue group of hacktivists who wish to use the computer's unique qualities for their own fight. Since the machine's intelligence is so alien, it is discovered that the only way to communicate with it is to take an experimental and dangerous drug cocktail that splinters the consciousness into three or four independent yet singularly motivated entities in a state of semi-controlled multiple personality disorder from which there is no recovery.
