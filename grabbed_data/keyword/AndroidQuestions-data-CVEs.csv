0,CVEs,AndroidQuestions,Is Android 5.1 (Lollipop) still supported?,3,84v3tm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/84v3tm/is_android_51_lollipop_still_supported/,2018-03-16 23:39:48,"I'm confused a bit. I thought that Android 5.1.x is already dead. I've got Nexus 4 updated to Android **5.1.1** (build *LMY48T*) - that's the update that I've received about 1 or 2 years ago. But when I check a **wiki page** on Android versions, I can see that 5.1.x is still marked as '*Supported*' [[link]](URL Moreover, when I'm checking the latest **security bulletin** it even mentions that for certain CVEs (e.g. CVE-2017-13255 or CVE-2017-13256) the 5.1.1 Android was one of the updated AOSP versions - you can see that [[here]](URL under 'System' section. My question is - **what the actual 5.1.x status then?** Why an old LMY48T 5.1.1 build [[link]](URL is the last build for Nexus 4 while 5.1.x is still patched for some recent CVE issues? Is it possible to get official Google's build of such newest patched 5.1.x Android for Nexus 4 (rather than a custom ROM)? Thanks! :)"
1,CVEs,AndroidQuestions,How does anyone else deal with Android security patches not being distributed?,7,781kzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/781kzb/how_does_anyone_else_deal_with_android_security/,2017-10-23 04:26:39,"I have a 2nd Generation Moto-X on 5.1. There's nothing wrong with it and it works fine. Use it with Republic Wireless and have had monthly bills mostly sub $20 on one of their no longer available plans for several years now. However its patch level is 2016-08-01. This means there are tons of unpatched issues. From what I can tell BlueBorne is unpatched, Krack is unpatched (probably expected 'till next month anyway I guess), etc. I haven't gone through the whole list of CVEs patched on URL But there seem to be dozens. I'm basically afraid to use my phone at this point, it's not safe to use BlueTooth, it's not safe to use WiFi... So what do you do? Motorola's website says as of Friday that my phone should still be getting security updates. But I haven't gotten one in over a year. So I contact Motorola. Motorola says: &gt; I'm sorry but as per checking here, the security patch available is only for 2016. In regards to this, kindly try to check with the support forums to further assist you with the security patch issue. As we just have a limited resources here in our ends. As the one who will release the patch is Google, the manufacturer such as Motorola together with the carrier is the one who will distribute the patch but as of now we don't have the information on the updated security patch. What? Is there a class action about this? Am I overblowing the dangers? (To me this seems like a car maker with a car that has multiple recalls refusing to fix the recalled parts.) Am I missing something? My desktop gets security fixes almost immediately every time a major issue is announced. Why are phones different? "
2,CVEs,AndroidQuestions,Recommend a tablet with guaranteed support,7,5dey2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/5dey2c/recommend_a_tablet_with_guaranteed_support/,2016-11-17 20:30:17,"Hi, I am looking for a new tablet. I have bought my current tablet  Dell Venue 7 one and half year ago and only one update came for it since. New OS version does not interest me too much, I am rather looking for security updates. For example the Dirty COW and lots of other CVEs will never be fixed on my tablet and I bought it just year and half ago  *new*! I know this is Android focused community but only tablet which came to my mind was iPad... Currently, I am looking for tablet for reading PDF books, so bigger screen is a plus (I have Kindle for ebooks). Do you know about any Android device which would satisfy my needs in this way? English is not my native language, so please excuse any mistakes."
