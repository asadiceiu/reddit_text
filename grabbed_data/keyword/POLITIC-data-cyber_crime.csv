Therefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC: FIRST, propose a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress; SECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health); THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated; FOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service; FIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government; SIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. On the same day, I will begin taking the following seven actions to protect American workers: FIRST, I will announce my intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205 SECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator FOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately FIFTH, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. SIXTH, lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward SEVENTH, cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix Americas water and environmental infrastructure Additionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law: FIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama SECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States THIRD, cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities FOURTH, begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that wont take them back FIFTH, suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting. Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration: 1. Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate. 2. End The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free. 3. American Energy &amp; Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral. 4. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable. 5. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications. 6. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families. 7. End Illegal Immigration Act Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first. 8. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars. 9. Restoring National Security Act. Rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester and expanding military investment; provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice; protects our vital infrastructure from cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values 10. Clean up Corruption in Washington Act. Enacts new ethics reforms to Drain the Swamp and reduce the corrupting influence of special interests on our politics. On November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government. This is my pledge to you. And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people."

For example, Brock openly admits his PAC coordinates with the Clinton campaign, which is probably illegal and certainly underhanded (see URL For me, however, their greatest crime was to spend roughly one million dollars hiring Internet trolls to work on behalf of Hillary Clinton online (see URL This has been a shameless attack on free speech and political discourse among the electorate. The effect in online discussion forums has been palpable. Serious criticisms of Clinton on Reddit have been quickly downvoted into oblivion, making it impossible to engage in reasonable, sustained and visible debate with other regular voters. More than merely frustrating, this is beyond the pale of what might be considered acceptable shenanigans common to political campaigns. It undermines Democracy itself. Comparing the actions of these hired trolls to violent suppression of political dissenters is hardly hyperbolic. For example, they differ in kind and means, but not in motive to what happened in Tiananmen Square. Are these cyber mercenaries so different from the Sturmabteilung? The goal is certainly the same: attack, suppress and intimidate. Such tactics will likely contribute to a common fear of public political discussion (see URL Its easy to imagine the possibility of repercussions for openly expressing your opinion in this environment. How far are we from an enemies list? Clintons tacit acceptance of such profoundly immoral actions show what kind of leader she would likely be. Sadly, I am not surprised. These tactics disqualify her from the highest office in my opinion, irrespective of the acceptability of the political alternatives. Perhaps Facebook and Reddit will come up with technological solutions to weed out such organized-trolling campaigns in the future. "

More of our kids are graduating than ever before; more of our people are insured than ever before. Presumably because of the mention of insurance. 4) Did clap when Obama said we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we've been in almost 30 years. 5) Did not clap at Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over. 6) Stood and clapped for we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 Generation who has served to keep us safe. We are humbled and grateful for your service. 7) Clapped for The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong. 8) Clapped for Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort? 9) Clapped for over the past five years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs. 10) Did not clap for today, America is number one in oil and gas. America is number one in wind power. Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008. 11) Clapped for thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save $750 at the pump. 12) Clapped for today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record. Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high. And more Americans finish college than ever before. 13) Did not clap for Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices. And in the past year alone, about ten million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage. 14) Did not clap for At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits. Instead, we've seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in fifty years. 15) Did not clap for We can't put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance, or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street, or refighting past battles on immigration when we've got a system to fix. And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, it will earn my veto. 16) Clapped for Tonight, together, let's do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American. 17) Did not clap for my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year. 18) Did not clap for In today's economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever. 19) Did not clap for It's not a nice-to-have  it's a must-have. It's time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or a women's issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us. And that's why my plan will make quality childcare more available, and more affordable, for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in America  by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year. 20) Did not clap for I'll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own. And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let's put it to a vote right here in Washington. Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave. It's the right thing to do. 21) Did not clap for nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages. That's why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. Biden stood and clapped. 22) Did not clap for to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it. If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise. 23) Coughs and blows nose around the 20:17 mark 24) Did not clap for That's why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college  to zero. 25) Does not clap for showing that free community college is possible. I want to spread that idea all across America, so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today. 26) Stands and claps for the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden, has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get new jobs. 27) Claps for to every CEO in America, let me repeat: If you want somebody who's going to get the job done, hire a veteran. 28) Does not clap for Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined. 29) Claps for no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future. But we do know we want them here in America. 30) Did not clap for So let's set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline. Let's pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than thirty times as many jobs per year, and make this country stronger for decades to come. 31) Claps for That's why I'm asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren't just free, but fair. 32) Clapped for I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine  one that delivers the right treatment at the right time. 33) Clapped for give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier. 34) Did not clap for I intend to protect a free and open internet, extend its reach to every classroom, and every community 35) Clapped and stood for In two months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay in space. Good luck, Captain  and make sure to Instagram it. 36) Did not clap for Let's close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest in America. 37) Did not clap for We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together. 38) Stands and claps for we stand united with people around the world who've been targeted by terrorists  from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris. We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally 39) Did not clap for I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL. 40) Clapped for we are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy. We're upholding the principle that bigger nations can't bully the small  by opposing Russian aggression, supporting Ukraine's democracy 41) Did not clap for In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date. 42) Did not clap for It doesn't make sense. That is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress. (Regarding negotiations with Iran and nuclear stockpiles) 43) Clapped for No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids. 44) Clapped for I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber-attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children's information. That should be a bipartisan effort 45) Clapped for healthcare workers are rolling back Ebola  saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease. 46) Did not clap for no challenge  no challenge  poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. 47) Did not clap for The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. We should act like it. 48) Did not clap for we've set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history. And that's why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts. 49) Did not clap for I've prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained. 50) Clapped for It's why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world. It's why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims 51) Did not clap for That's why we defend free speech, and advocate for political prisoners, and condemn the persecution of women, or religious minorities, or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. We do these things not only because they're right, but because they make us safer. 52) Did not clap for Its time to close Gitmo 53) Clapped for I know how tempting such cynicism may be. But I still think the cynics are wrong. I still believe that we are one people. I still believe that together, we can do great things, even when the odds are long. 54) Did not clap for I've seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in states that seven in ten Americans call home. 55) Clapped for A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other; where we talk issues, and values, and principles, and facts, rather than ""gotcha"" moments, or trivial gaffes, or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people's daily lives. 56) Clapped for We still may not agree on a woman's right to choose, but surely we can agree it's a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows, and that every woman should have access to the health care she needs. 57) Did not clap for surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred; that it's being denied to too many 58) Did not clap for the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America's criminal justice system so that it protects and serves us all. 59) Clapped for If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, join me in the work at hand. If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you'll at least work with me where you do agree. And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger. 60) Clapped for we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states; that we are the United States of America.

And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, it will earn my veto. * Clapped for Tonight, together, let's do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American. * Did not clap for my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year. * Did not clap for In today's economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever. * Did not clap for It's not a nice-to-have  it's a must-have. It's time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or a women's issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us. And that's why my plan will make quality childcare more available, and more affordable, for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in America  by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year. * Did not clap for I'll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own. And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let's put it to a vote right here in Washington. Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave. It's the right thing to do. * Did not clap for nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages. That's why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. Biden stood and clapped. * Did not clap for to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it. If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise. * Coughs and blows nose around the 20:17 mark * Did not clap for That's why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college  to zero. * Does not clap for showing that free community college is possible. I want to spread that idea all across America, so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today. * Stands and claps for the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden, has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get new jobs. * Claps for to every CEO in America, let me repeat: If you want somebody who's going to get the job done, hire a veteran. * Does not clap for Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined. * Claps for no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future. But we do know we want them here in America. * Did not clap for So let's set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline. Let's pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than thirty times as many jobs per year, and make this country stronger for decades to come. * Claps for That's why I'm asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren't just free, but fair. * Clapped for I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine  one that delivers the right treatment at the right time. * Clapped for give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier. * Did not clap for I intend to protect a free and open internet, extend its reach to every classroom, and every community * Clapped and stood for In two months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay in space. Good luck, Captain  and make sure to Instagram it. * Did not clap for Let's close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest in America. * Did not clap for We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together. * Stands and claps for we stand united with people around the world who've been targeted by terrorists  from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris. We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally * Did not clap for I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL. * Clapped for we are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy. We're upholding the principle that bigger nations can't bully the small  by opposing Russian aggression, supporting Ukraine's democracy * Did not clap for In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date. * Did not clap for It doesn't make sense. That is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress. (Regarding negotiations with Iran and nuclear stockpiles) * Clapped for No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids. * Clapped for I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber-attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children's information. That should be a bipartisan effort * Clapped for healthcare workers are rolling back Ebola  saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease. * Did not clap for no challenge  no challenge  poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change. * Did not clap for The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. We should act like it. * Did not clap for we've set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history. And that's why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts. * Did not clap for I've prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained. * Clapped for It's why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world. It's why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims * Did not clap for That's why we defend free speech, and advocate for political prisoners, and condemn the persecution of women, or religious minorities, or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. We do these things not only because they're right, but because they make us safer. * Did not clap for Its time to close Gitmo * Clapped for I know how tempting such cynicism may be. But I still think the cynics are wrong. I still believe that we are one people. I still believe that together, we can do great things, even when the odds are long. * Did not clap for I've seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in states that seven in ten Americans call home. * Clapped for A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other; where we talk issues, and values, and principles, and facts, rather than ""gotcha"" moments, or trivial gaffes, or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people's daily lives. * Clapped for We still may not agree on a woman's right to choose, but surely we can agree it's a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows, and that every woman should have access to the health care she needs. * Did not clap for surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred; that it's being denied to too many * Did not clap for the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America's criminal justice system so that it protects and serves us all. * Clapped for If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, join me in the work at hand. If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you'll at least work with me where you do agree. And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger. * Clapped for we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states; that we are the United States of America. It appears to me that Barack and Boehner have more than a few things that they agree on. Lets hope they can actually get something done regarding those things. "
