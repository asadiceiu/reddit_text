0,cyber crime,AskNetsec,Solution for stopping users from doing cyber crime,2,g21ww7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/g21ww7/solution_for_stopping_users_from_doing_cyber_crime/,2020-04-16 08:07:57,"Hi AskNetsec If you are familiar with cryptocurrencies, you have probably heard about seed phrases: 12 or 24 words that unlock your wallet address (those words are easier to remember than the private key so they are preferred). If you want to generate a seed phrase just use iancoleman.io or metasafe.org I worked on a tool which allows users to recover their seed IF they forgot a word or 2. Say your seed phrase was ""ramp cool corn spell uncover dad video road tongue theme jealous rival"" and you split your seed phrase into different files but one of them cannot be open because you lost it (hardware failure). That file had 2 words that you now miss. My tool will find those two seed words for you :) This is a very niche tool and solves a very specific problem but this is not my concern. The problem is that I don't want users to use it for malicious purposes such as bruteforcing. Even though I believe that users are responsible for how they use it, it's my social responsibility to be concerned about how it is being used. For example, if you go to a supermarket they can't stop you from getting a knife and use it in a bad way in that supermarket however that knife comes in some special package that makes it more difficult to open, etc. Consider that the tool comes as a windows/mac executable so everything will be local on user's machine. No analysis or API calls to those seed phrases will be made. Any solutions you can think of? Should I simply do ""fraud analysis"" using machine learning?"
1,cyber crime,AskNetsec,What has the internet become to - and is it even worth it anymore?,2,dsl2kc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/dsl2kc/what_has_the_internet_become_to_and_is_it_even/,2019-11-07 06:15:19,"I copied this quote from another topic here ""*""merely visiting a page could compromise your system.""..* Meaning, just by opening a damn browser i am in the risk of being compromised.. Yes i understand there is things such as common-sense and security measures.. but come on, is this what the internet has become to? I am writing this post because a very elderly person i tend to is thinking about getting an Laptop.. She has no connection to the internet at the moment. With the advanced level of cyber-crime we are experiencing today, my thoughts were that its not about if she will be compromised, but its just a matter of WHEN... Our law-enforcement seemed to have given up on cyber-crime and as long as banks just cover the losses of people getting hacked, then they pretty much wont pursue anything.. Our elderlies are just sitting ducks waiting to be exploited with loss of finances and dignity in life.. Ofcourse i understand the upside of the internet, my frustration is just on how cyber-crime has become the new cowboy-age where cyber-billythekid just plunges in and steals people finances in which they have worked damn hard for, with minimum repercussions as ""As soon as the money leaves the country we can do anything about it"" mentality, just like billythekid who rode on his horse out of the village with the cash in hand and nothing could really be done about it. Lawless could be the word. I was just curious to hear about others opinion on this? Is this just the new normal?"

I need some guidance from more experienced people in the field. Thanks in advance for helping me out! I am in my mid-late twenties looking to transition to cybersecurity from an investigative field (financial crime/blockchain investigations). I hold a BSc and MA in International Security Studies and do not want to go back to uni, I prefer to take up the cert pathway. My IT skillset is something of an A+ cert with decent cyber policy/threat skills from my job. &amp;#x200B; I have read a ton of mixed opinion posts on going the Comptia network+, sec+, before getting more technical pathway and trying to get an entry-ish level security job. Alternatively CCNA coupled with sec+? Or something like eJPT and study tons and eventually go for OSCP. I have a year of expenses saved up and really want to make it count, I have a lot of time and grasp concepts quickly. I lean much more toward the vulnerability/pentest part since I am quite inquisitive by nature and enjoy finding exploits in all sorts of things. If anybody could point me toward a solid study route I would greatly appreciate it. &amp;#x200B; Thanks, Pete"

4,cyber crime,AskNetsec,60 Must-Know Cybersecurity Statistics for 2019,70,b9kbtz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/b9kbtz/60_mustknow_cybersecurity_statistics_for_2019/,2019-04-05 11:07:39," Cybersecurity issues are becoming a day-to-day struggle for businesses. Trends show a huge increase in hacked and breached data from sources that are increasingly common in the workplace, like mobile and IoT devices. Additionally, recent research suggests that most companies have unprotected data and poor cybersecurity practices in place, making them vulnerable to data loss. Weve compiled 60 cybersecurity statistics to give you a better idea of the current state of overall security, and paint a picture of how potentially dire leaving your company unsecure can be. **Data Breaches by the Numbers** The increasing amount of large-scale, well-publicized breaches suggests that not only are the number of security breaches going up  theyre increasing in severity, as well. 1.

The first email with an altered domain doesn't look like it hops through o365 servers at all. But the original from in the first received line is missing. The first email also has an x originating IP line but it just goes to an ISP. Probably also fabricated I'm assuming. I'm kind of a he says admin in training. I've been with this company for only 3 months. They're asking me because I traced a bad email back to a specific person a few weeks ago. It was easy though because he left an obvious calling card in the headers and it was enough to go off. I only did it because I was annoyed he was arrogant to do it. I typically use the buscador OS and some of Michael bazzel's tools for OSINT but I really don't have a lot to go off of this time. I don't have domains to scrape or valid whois queries. I have no real names or contact info. Any advice on how to proceed? I've already told the management involved to report a cyber crime."

About a year and a half ago I started working as a cyber intelligence analyst for this same financial institution. Its NOT a very technical positionmostly what Im doing is a lot of dark web counterintelligence and OSINT. I do investigations on suspicious IP addresses, phishing sites, etc but really nothing very technical, as we pass the more technical stuff to the Infosec guys to handleI just write the reports. The company is willing to pay for a cert and I would like to learn the more technical stuff. Im thinking of starting with the security+, but it also might make sense to go with an incident response or forensics cert since these concepts line up more closely with my background in intelligence. The goal is to be a cyber threat intelligence analyst in the more traditional sense. Thanks for your input! "
7,cyber crime,AskNetsec,Opportunity to do intern thesis at a port on information/cyber security. Need help with topic,14,7n5frn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/7n5frn/opportunity_to_do_intern_thesis_at_a_port_on/,2017-12-31 11:59:58,"Hi /r/AskNetsec! After finishing all my courses of my Masters in Business Information Management I have gotten an opportunity to do my thesis internship at a large port in Europe. While not having deep technical knowledge, I am asked, and am really enthousiastic about, to research a information/cyber security related topic. As this is a field I have become really interested in I also started to learn some programming and am learning as much as possible on the topic. Meanwhile, I do have understanding of IT-business related topics and could therefore 'tackle' this topic search by looking at it from this angle. For example risk; digitalization influence on cyber risk, and; awareness of cybersecurity across the port are topics that come to mind. These topics are however still quite broad and vague and this is why I am asking you guys for tips and thoughts what things would be interesting to have a look at. I have briefly summed up some possible research topics that I have come up with and would be very glad with suggestions that might narrow these topics down! I read your topics daily and love you guys as a community, many thanks to all the help you give to everyone! * **Topics:** * Digitalization of Ports and its relation to risks and threats to security. * Awareness as a driver for a more cyber resilient environment in ports. * How regulation and guidelines can help steer ports toward a more cyber resilient environment. * Research into port systems evolution to drive a secure port * Threats of organized crime and how to go forward on this growing problem. (I think this is a really interesting topic, however im not sure whether this is researchable. (think of interviews with people involved etc.) * How can the port translate the 'technical' talk to be more understandable for business, i.e. make cybersecurity accessable for management and employees. * Implementing a (long term) cyber security strategy. (what would this look like and what are the implications) * Risk assessment of vulnerability across the various parts of the port, e.g. storage, boat-to-shore systems, oil. * Managing issues that come from the many different private owners in the port, and how to unite the port as one cybersecurity stronghold.

I hope this type of post isn't too self-indulgent, I figured the discussion generated could be useful to others with similar interests. My IT background in point form below: * self taught programmer from early teens * no university degree * 1 year technical school programming certificate that I got quite a while ago. It was much more breadth than depth and covered a lot of ground I had already self-taught. Exposed me to a few things I probably wouldn't have taken an interest in on my own but overall fairly disappointing course. The feeling I got was much more that they were interested in getting students to sign up (and pay) than making sure they had a skill set ready for the job market. * never worked in an actual programmer / dev role professionally. Have continued to develop small things on my own time. Python is the tool of choice. * worked my way up the path of internal QA dept. -> Helpdesk -> sysadmin * More comfortable with Linux sysadmin than Windows but can work my through either with time & docs * Strong interest in security for several years, particularly the offensive side. Work on vulnerable VMs, CTF challenges, etc... Jack of all trades in this area. Competent in web application attacks, understand assembly, concepts of binaries and memory layout, can work gdb / OllyDbg / windbg / IDA / radare, able to identify & write exploits for basic vulnerabilities in binary executables, nmap, metasploit, etc... Career wise I'm getting pretty worn out doing day to day sysadmin / operational support in the commercial sector. I'll always be fascinated by the tech and will always be ready to learn technical stuff on my own, but I'm burning out on being situations where I'm having to get up to speed super fast on something I'm not that familiar with because of a last minute need from a production team. Or scheduling / executing maintenances amongst production teams who all insist any interruption at any hour of the day is disastrous for their timeline. Not necessarily a good headspace with which to keep a sysadmin career going. In addition to the above IT stuff I have a strong interest in intelligence, internation relations, cyber security law & policy, jurisdiction, law enforcement, issues related to cyber crime & state sponsored hacking / espionage, open source intelligence gathering online, etc... I'm at a crossroads right now where I have the opportunity to make a change so I'm considering going to to do a Political Science degree to pursue my interests in these areas. Any thoughts on roles that could benefit from the technical background while putting me more in that academic / policy / strategy space? I think I'm well suited to be that guy with a foot in both worlds, comfortable interacting with people and social issues as well as terminals. The dream role I imagine for myself would be more in an R&D type situation where I can experiment with different security related technologies, analyze and report on trends in the areas of cyber attacks / crime, etc... All this while feeling like I'm making a positive impact on the world. I understand that in any job where they pay you there are deliverables and deadlines but the idea would be something more exploratory, less driven by the commercial end result. </special_snowflake_story> Have at it, happy to hear your thoughts."

Is there someone with clearance experience?",8,4ehys9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/4ehys9/chance_of_obtaining_secret_level_security/,2016-04-13 06:16:06,"This is the best place I can think of for this question, bear with me if it is not entirely security related. This is going to be long and in depth, but if you have any input I would appreciate it. I am a male 18 year old student at a US university, 19 before this summer, studying Cyber Security with an honors program. By next spring, I will be a junior in credit hours, and judging by my current averages, my GPA should be roughly 3.4+. I have been requested to intern this summer under a high level defense contractor(but I already have an internship in progress) as well as a few high level security firms. With this comes the requirement to obtain a security clearance- for the summer of 2017-which in my case, is quite unique. Reading over things online, a million and a half things are said about the ""past 7 years"" and such, but I have yet to see anything regarding someone as young as I am obtaining clearance. Firstly, I am a dual citizen- USA a my only form of residency in my life, while having European dual citizenship. It is my understanding that I would have to destroy and denounce my citizenship/paperwork/passport in front of a government official to even be considered. This is an action I would rather not take until it is assured that I would be able to get the clearance, which is why I am trying to determine my likelyhood to be granted of Secret. For drug use: I first smoked marijuanna when I was roughly 14, almost 15, IIRC. In that next year, I smoked roughly 30 times. At the age of 16, I started moving away from it drastically- smoking at most 25 times between ages 16 and 18( and much less each time, though that doesn't seem to matter). After I turned 18, I smoked only very occasionally, 4-5 times since the fall semester and now. The last time I had smoked was in march 2016, but the last time before that was january 10th 2016. I was recently prescribed a stimulant for ADHD but have never used bought sold or gifted any prescription medication. For alcohol use: I had my first real drink when I was 15. (In my country of dual citizenship, given to me by my parents). At that point forward, I quickly understood where my ""limit"" was. When with friends, I have drank enough to be drunk but never enough to forget things or do things I would normally not do. This was roughly 6-7 times from the ages of 16-18, with ""normal"" drinking, like a beer, glass of wine, mixed drink, etc. about 1 time a month, usually with family, over that period. Since turning 18, I have consumed one liter of wiskey over a 5 month period, never getting drunk, and have not drank anything since December 2015. For computer/online delinquencies- I have never hacked anyone, or any website etc maliciously after the age of 16. Before the age of 16, I bought a trial month of a booting service to DOS friends in a strictly joking manner. This service was limited to 2-minute-max booting attacks, and not linked to me in any way besides a burner giftcard. I have never pirated items on campus internet, nor used campus internet in any malicious way. I have pirated quite a few things from my home network, however. One warning notice was given to my stepfather very recently from the isp, and nothing has been torrented since. For friends and references: this one is what is scaring me the most. While I smoked generally only on occasion with my closest friends, many of my friends are much more intense. One of my old friends was arrested recently, while under probation for marijuanna possesion, due to possesion of THC concentrates(felony). This was the third time he was arrested, 2nd time since he was 18 years old(first arrest was when we were close, but it was expunged from his record as he was &lt;18.) He was not with any of my other friends at the time of his last arrest. I stopped being close to him roughly may 2015. Besides him, every single close/semiclose friend that I have had in highschool was or is a pot smoker. For almost all of them, I have smoked with or know that I have smoked. Almost all of my closer friends in college smoke or know I smoked, as well. My closest friends back home still smoke weekly, some even daily, but have never been arrested or gotten in trouble with the law. Only my mother, father, and sister would be adult references that know that I have smoked and how consistently I did so. My stepfather has a green card and lives with my mother without technically being married. My father and stepmother live out of state and I have never resided with them more than 1 month at a time. Sexual delinquency/ past relations with criminal persons/ history of blackmail.- I am gay, and was publicly ""closeted"" to all but close friends until this year(if people ask, I tell them now, not that anyone has ever asked.) My family was informed shortly after my discovery. I have had 2 real relationships in my life. The first relationship was with someone just over 2 years older than I. It ended quite horribly, and unrelated to me he was charged (dropped) for ddosing a corporate site, and a crime i will not disclose, unrelating to anything security related (dismissed) or myself. He blackmailed me to continue the relationship, threatening suicide and public announcement of my sexuality which at the time was very troubling, and virtually stalked me for several months thereafter. My mother was involved closely with this. All contact was severed many years ago, but I know that the FBI has a file on him, as well as state officials, and police were involved multiple times in his regard. The second guy smoked marijuana occasionally and still does. I have not had other relations besides short dating periods in recent months of school. TL:DR. I am a dual EU/US citizen and travel often, but always to places the US is in agreement with. I have 2 drug tests on record that have passed entirely. I have never gotten a ticket, been arrested, or had involvement in anyone around me being arrested. now-distanced close friends have been arrested. Several of my friends from much younger years have become small time dealers, but I no longer have contact to them. I have never done something blackmailable outside of my sexuality(which at this point is not a concern to me besides toward my employers) or using marijuana. I have never bought or sold illegal drugs or prescription medication. Almost everyone my age that I know has, or does, smoke marijuana. I have never used a computer maliciously post 16 years old. I never intend to smoke marijuana again, have smoked less than 5 times since my 18th birthday, and less than 30 times since my 16th. If anyone has input, want to shoot how my chances look, tell me what can and cannot be kept out, or have useful info for me I would appreciate it. I do not want to lie for secret clearance(also simply because i am morally against it) and then have it revoked if down the line if i was to investigated for Top Secret for example. I also do not want to attempt this too early, get denied, and prevent myself from obtaining clearance years down the line when I could get an actual job. Thanks netsec!!"

I study computer security and have this year done cyber crime, information assurance and advanced networking if that helps. What would you do if you had the chance? I have about just under 3months to do 15,000 words, 5000 of which has to be on an artifact of something I've created.. Any input would be helpful, thanks. "
