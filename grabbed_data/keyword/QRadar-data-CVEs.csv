0,CVEs,QRadar,How are you using QVM?,1,fsf5lu,https://www.reddit.com/r/QRadar/comments/fsf5lu/how_are_you_using_qvm/,2020-04-01 02:42:07,"Im curious how others are leveraging the QRadar Vulnerability Management module. We purchased QVM with the initial install, but never really found a good use case for it as we have a better vulnerability scanning product and dont find the vulnerability management fits our style. I noticed today that part of the QID for Snort/Firepower include the attached CVEs. I want to create a report based on CVEs being attacked, but it appears these fields cant be used. Also would like to be able to push CVEs to a reference set so I can programmatically bump them up against the vuln scanner to determine results."
1,CVEs,QRadar,New: M5 firmware (v4.0.0) available on IBM Fix Central for xSeries appliances,8,d9mgo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/QRadar/comments/d9mgo6/new_m5_firmware_v400_available_on_ibm_fix_central/,2019-09-27 03:00:49,"Hey all, &amp;#x200B; Just a quick notice that we've published a new QRadar appliance xSeries M5 v4.0.0 firmware update on IBM Fix Central. The M5 firmware v4.0.0 updates UEFI, IMM2, raid controller, HDD software revisions, and resolves several CVEs as outlined in the release notes. &amp;#x200B; For IBM xSeries appliances, the QRadar team validates firmware updates to ensure that they do not cause issues on the IBM M5 QRadar appliances. There are two firmware versions available depending on you prefer to update, but both versions can update all M5 form factor appliances (1U &amp; 2U): 1. Remotely via IMM using an EXE/ISO file (The EXE contains the ISO and other software)or 2. On-premise with a USB drive using an IMG file &amp;#x200B; The release notes include a summary tab, plus the installation instructions on the second tab. Each download type has a specific set of instructions. It is important for admins to read these before they start an appliance update for example when you do an IMM update, you must update the IMM software first, then apply the ISO update remotely. One item to be cautious of for both install types is that in the past users have reported that not all of the firmware check boxes are selected automatically when the software attempts to identify required fixes. It is best to ensure that all updates are checked/selected (especially for UEFI updates) otherwise you might need to repeat the install to get a fix applied. &amp;#x200B; **Links** * M5 v4.0.0 for ISO installs (remote installs via IMM): * [Release notes](URL * [Fix Central EXE download](URL * M5 v4.0.0 for IMG installs (on-prem USB drive) * [Release notes](URL * [Fix Central IMG download](URL * Master firmware list: [URL &amp;#x200B; If there are follow-up questions, let us know."

We've published a few interim fixes and a 7.2.8 Patch 16 that contains security bulletins. A list of changes and recently released software can be found on the * [Master Software Page &amp; Release Notes](URL (also in sidebar) that I maintain for users. &amp;nbsp; Here is a quick summary: * July 12, 2019: Added QRadar 7.3.2 Patch 2 Interim Fix 02 to resolve WinCollect APAR IJ17394. * July 9, 2019: Added QRadar 7.2.8 Patch 16. Security bulletins published for this release. * July 5, 2019: Added QRadar 7.3.1 Patch 8 IF03 **AND** 7.3.2 Patch 2 IF01. &amp;nbsp; For those users on QRadar 7.2.8 software, the development team recently published 7.2.8 Patch 16 (7.2.8.20190703194519) to IBM Fix Central. This update includes 1 APAR and 9 security bulletins for fixes that apply to both QRadar 7.2.8 Patch 16 and other QRadar releases (7.3.1 P8 &amp; 7.3.2 P1). &amp;nbsp; Users should have received the notices via IBM My Notifications, but I have added the CVEs for these issues to the [master APARs table](URL To quickly filter for these items you can use the text search for CVE, filter by version buttons, or use both the button filter and CVE. We are trying to make these easier to locate for users so the master page links to each version where the APAR/CVE is resolved. I'm working to backport more APARs in to this table now and add new features so this is easier to use all around. &amp;nbsp; If there are follow-up questions, let me know."

This firmware has two separate downloads by appliance type based on format 1U versus 2U. - Change lists are included with every release. To open a change list, use any text editor, such as Notepad++ or Wordpad. - USB firmware updates still require administrators to be on-site with the appliance or have the created USB drive on premise with the appliance. We do not support remotely updating firmware at this time."
