0,cyber crime,technology,How does the US charge &amp; extradite so many suspects for computer crimes/cyber crimes committed by individuals not residing in the U.S.?,29,5bg9oh,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/5bg9oh/how_does_the_us_charge_extradite_so_many_suspects/,2016-11-07 02:34:37,"If we're talking about people who manage sites such as the owner of Kickass Torrents, who have never set foot in the US; how does the US manage to charge and extradite these kinds of suspects? The web seems to be crawling with news stories about non-US citizens being extradited to the US for computer crimes committed abroad. From what little I understand, there's some kind of loophole whereby if US ""servers"" are used to commit criminal activity, that it enables them (US authorities) to claim jurisdiction of sorts on the case. I'm semi confused by this. Is there a site or article which clearly explains how US authorities can claim a crime was committed ""in the US""? Next: what constitutes a server ? In that case, it seems relatively simple to implicate someone else operating a naughty website: I can just redirect additional traffic from mywebsite.com to thepiratebay.com ; and even go as far as setting up fake credit cards and account data pretending to be TBP, even though I'm not TPB. Do cloud servers or content delivery networks count (I'm hosting content on servers in the Ukraine, but my CDN or Amazon replicates my content onto US servers)? It sounds like the US basically has carte blanche to go and charge whoever the fuck they want to when it comes to computer crimes, and that they have a large amount of leeway. Considering how content is often replicated across servers in different locations, including the US, I'm really confused as to where the line is drawn. What happens to people who use services like Gmail, whose content is at least partially hosted/replicated on US servers? Does the madness stop anywhere? Here's one such article which vaguely explains the whole US servers part of my story: URL Any better articles with more details and examples? Edit : I just wanted to clarify. I understand that we have extradition treaties in place with other countries. What I'm trying to figure out is how the US determines that they can charge someone for crimes committed on US soil (e.g.: wire fraud, hacking, conspiracy) in order to begin said extradition proceedings.

It is shrinking in virtual size, becoming more open, and easily accessible. A lot can be accomplished with a click of a button, from important decisions being made to colossal amounts of money being transferred to countries that are miles away. We live and breath in a world that is so fragile  where one wrong move can send hackers a million opportunities for them to use their scary skills in the manner that makes us grind our teeth  within a split second. This kind of world  one that is speeding on the highway to robotic glory  requires a special kind of attention when it comes to security. Security can mean different things to different people. For some, its knowing that their home is protected from thieves running about the streets, and for others, its the same assurance guaranteeing their personal data is protected from cyber burglars, that are hungry to feast on fresh confidential knowledge. The fact of the matter is, we live in an animal kingdom (and we always have been!)  we just keep forgetting. Somewhere along the journey of evolution, people introduced a rigid system of law and order; a system that claims to protect life and property from those that are envious, or feel inferior. But what our founders failed to acknowledge is that introducing a judicial system does not automatically stop crime. As technology lays down the rules for the 21st century, global relations and habits become more intertwined and complex than a spiders web. The complexity of computer science has gained so much power over the ordinary mind, that it is slowly becoming difficult for tech-average folk to keep up, or even remotely, understand the consequences of having personal information on the line. It is paramount for people to realise that the world of technology is literally like a world. Despite having knowledge on longitude, latitude and land mass, there is always something new to discover, that may change or influence the existence of things. Therefore, putting your personal data out there is your responsibility, no one elses. And yes, there are security geniuses that help you shield this personal data, but ultimately shielding comes from within your mind. To all those clever tech gurus out there: bring justice to the term guru. Things need to be taken it down a few notches. People need to know what it really means to be online. They need to be truly tech-aware in this fathomless age. The wrinkles in the spread of knowledge need to be ironed out. Tell the truth in a way Macy can understand."
2,cyber crime,technology,Is Your Business Under Cyber Threat !!,1,2zgjhd,http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2zgjhd/is_your_business_under_cyber_threat/,2015-03-18 23:07:06,"Business firms are getting more aware and determined about Cyber Intelligence and Threat Mitigation service. In today`s world where in a connected ecosystem technology has eased lives and brought business to our fingertips. This ease of business also has a flipside as it gives this ease of access to not only the good guys but also the bad ones. There are big underground markets where hackers are furbishing kits to create identities, foster scams and eyeing credit cards &amp; other frauds. scam-emails-greenbirdmedia How many mails do you receive everyday which make you suspicious about the origination or the sender? Not sure, check your mail box again &amp; you will surely find many. Dell SecureWorks released an update in 2013 on black hat markets, noticing a number of noteworthy trends beyond the theft of personal credentials such as passports, drivers licenses, working Social Security numbers and even utility bills as a second form of authentication. The report released had details on hacking and crime ware services and how they mimic legitimate business practices. The question arises, how to recognize a phishing mail or link. They can be in a number of forms, like the company that you do business with, the bank or finance institution you are linked with or any social networking site. They will ask for personal information or bank account details, and once you disclose it, you fell like a prey to them. The most common fraud mechanism used is domain spoofing. The cyber criminals pretend to be the bank, retail store, travel service etc you use, to prompt you to give away your private information &amp; credentials. The easy targets being elderly people who are not used to internet usage &amp; generally fall prey to these insidious schemes. Symantec has released a report which highlights a recent trend where mails are coming through domains which are similar to the registered domains of your regular service provider. Such domain names are carefully selected &amp; if you are not vigilant, can easily catch you on the wrong foot. These spam campaigns invoke user action for nonexistent goods or services to receive payments by wire or credit card transfers. The way to avoid this is by being intuitive &amp; suspicious. Do not open dubious mails with farce offers, like you have won a million dollars etc. If you open the mail by mistake, check the sender mail address and you sure will find out that you dont need to take any action and it`s right place is your trash folder. A lot of online websites also provide cyber intelligence and threat mitigation services &amp; monitor such fraudulent schemes for businesses.

3,cyber crime,technology,Computing Principles: All About Cyber Crimes And Laws,1,2xmgvx,http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2xmgvx/computing_principles_all_about_cyber_crimes_and/,2015-03-02 12:57:25,"Almost everyone is aware of the word Cyber Crimes, right? Maybe you are unaware of COMPUTING PRINCIPLES but its a very simple self-explanatory word. Computing Principles are some ideals which are followed during computer operating. So, whenever you are surfing using PC, you need to follow those principles set up by the International Law. And when these laws of Computing Principles are broken, it give rise to CYBER CRIME. Yes, now you are all set to learn all those of Cyber Crimes and take care not to commit those crimes. Well, you must be already knowing some of the crimes committed, right? The most popular one  Hacking, Spam, Phishing (Especially in Facebook) and maybe one or two more. But today, we are going to give you insights about some more of the crimes which are unknown and hence create an awareness about that. Starting on with Computing Principles, just carry on with your work you are going to do which should not harm anyone and this is the key to follow Computing Principles. Yes, computing principles are the ideals for protecting a users data and his credentials from anyone. As it is well known, a Facebook hacker is hired by Facebook to increase the safety from Hacking, likewise the Computing Principles are some of the Principles which on breaking can result into charge of law violations and can also result in imprisonment. And hence todays topic is widely covered on knowledge of Cyber Crimes to be aware and be safe from committing such crimes. So, let us move ahead to the different types of Computing Principles and Crimes going on the field of Computers and avoid them or be safe from such criminal attacks and master ourselves with the knowledge of All About Computers. Introduction To Computing Principles: Computers and their usage have been of great benefit in various areas like communication, business and education. Internet, which facilitates linking several computers anywhere in the world, is no doubt an amazing tool. It helps in facilitating global access and thus eliminates all hurdles of communication and problems of inordinate delay. However, this facility could be misused and criminals who skilfully navigate the Internet could victimize individuals and organizations by indulging in unauthorized access and thus perpetrating crimes. This lesson addresses such serious issues that are challenging the Digital Age of computers and Internet. Also, for more knowledge on computer and other things, who can go on here. Cyber Crimes: Now let us come to the real topic. Now, we are all aware of the Computing Principles. So, lets head towards knowing all the Cyber Crimes and the consequences. Also called Computer Crime, E-Crime, Hi-Tech Crime, Electronic Crime and by many more names, is where a computer is the target of a crime or is the means adopted to commit a crime. It relates to criminal activities such as fraud, theft, blackmail, forgery and embezzlement using the new medium, often involving the Internet. Such offences alter damage, delete, destroy or otherwise use any data, computer system or computer network without permission or authority. Types Of Cyber Crimes - 1. Hacking: Hacking is defined as, deliberately gaining unauthorised access to an information system and deliberately altering or deleting data and thus diminishing the value of information. In extreme cases, it may amount to a crime against the national security when the defendant accesses commercial or national sensitive materials. 2. Masquerading: Only a few people are aware of this crime. Masquerading occurs when a person uses the identity of another to gain access to a computer, This may be done in person or remotely. There are both physical and electronic forms of masquerading. In person, a criminal may use an authorized users identity or access card to get into restricted areas where he will have access to computers and data. This may be as simple as signing someone elses name to a signing sheet at the door of a building. It may be as complex as playing back a voice recording of someone else to gain entry via a voice recognition system ! 3. Phishing: Phishing is a form of criminal activity characterized by attempts to fraudulently acquire sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card details. The most common phishing attack occurs when entering into someones Facebook account which we call as FB Hack! Phishing is typically carried out using email or an instant message, though it has more recently exploited fax. But nowadays, the internet browser are made considering into account the phishing attacks done and hence protects you from any kind of phishing attack. The term Phishing derives from password harvesting and the use of increasingly sophisticated lures to fish for users financial information and passwords. With the growing number of reported Phishing incidents, additional methods of protection are needed. Attempts include legislation, user training and technical measures. 4. Spam: Mostly, all of us are aware of this term. Unsolicited e-mail, often of a commercial nature, sent indiscriminately to multiple mailing lists, individuals, or newsgroups; junk e-mail. Spamming is commonly defined as the sending of unsolicited bulk e-mail  that is, email that was not asked for (unsolicited) and received by multiple recipients (bulk). E-mail spam is by far the most common form of spamming on the internet. It involves sending identical or nearly identical unsolicited messages to a large number of recipients. Unlike legitimate commercial e-mail, spam is generally sent without the explicit permission of the recipients and frequently contains various tricks to bypass e-mail filters. 5. Eavesdropping On Emanations: Electronic emanations from computer equipment are risks that one needs to be aware of, although this is mainly a concern for military and intelligence data. Computer equipment, like every other type of electrical equipment from hairdryers to stereos, emits electromagnetic impulses. Whenever one strikes a computer key, an electronic impulse is sent into the immediate area. Foreign intelligence services, commercial enterprises may take advantage of these electronic emanations by monitoring, intercepting and decoding them. This may sound highly sophisticated, but there have been some embarrassing easy cases. 6. Denial OR Degradation Of Service: There are many ways to disrupt service, including such physical means as shutting off power, air conditioning, or water (needed by air conditioning systems); or performing various kinds of electromagnetic disturbances. Some cases of electronic sabotage involve the actual destruction or disabling of equipment or data. Turning off power or sending messages to system software telling it to stop processing are examples of the first type of attack. The other type of attack is known as flooding. In this type of attack, instead of shutting down service, the attacker puts more and more of a strain on the systems ability to service requests, so eventually they cant function at all ! 7. Social Engineering: It is the name given to a category of attacks in which someone manipulates other into revealing information that can be used to steal data or subvert systems. Such attacks can be very simple or very complex. For example, a man posing as the Managing Director of the Company simply asks for his password for logging on his computer, pretending that he has forgotten the password. He then can use that to steal important files from the system. 8. Software Piracy: Software piracy is an issue that spans the category boundaries and may be enforced in some organizations and not in others. Pirated computer programs are big business. Copying and selling off-the-shelf application programs in violation of the copyrights cost software vendors dearly. The problem is an international one, reaching to an epidemic proportion in some countries. 9. Viruses: A virus is a small piece of software that adds on real programs. For example, a virus might attach itself to a program such as a spreadsheet program. Each time the spreadsheet program runs, the virus runs too, and it has the chance to reproduce (by attaching to other programs) or wreak havoc. Various kinds of virus and worms are as below. a. E-mail viruses: E-mail virus moves around in e-mail messages, and usually replicates itself by automatically mailing to dozens of people in the victims e-mail address book. b. Worms: A worm is a small piece of software that uses computer networks and security holes to replicate itself. A copy of the worm scans the network for another machine that has a specific security hole. It copies itself to the new machine using the security hole, and then starts replicating from there, as well. c. Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is simply a computer program. The program claims to do one thing (it may claim to be a game) but instead does damage when you run it (it may erase your hard disk). Trojan horses have no way to replicate automatically. Examples And Consequences Of Cyber Crime: Below are some examples of some of the big virus infections which took place in the history of computers. Have a look at them. A computer student in USA unleashed a computer virus over the Internet in November 1988, jamming thousands of computers all over the world. He was convicted under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and was penalized $10000. Quite a big amount for just a small virus, right? Back in March 1999, the Melissa virus was so powerful that it forced Microsoft and a number of other very large companies to companies to completely turn off their e-mail systems until the virus could be contained. The ILOVEYOU virus in 2000 had a similarly devastating effect. Thats pretty impressive when you consider that the Melissa and ILOVEYOU viruses are incredibly simple ! Experts estimate that the Mydoom worm infected approximately a quarter-million computers in a single day in January 2004! The history of Computers has great examples of how a Computer can be useful if maintained properly and how can it be harmful destroying the vast systems made by experts which took years and years to create. So, we should take utmost care that we do not take part in any such activities violating the Computer Principles. So, your next question would be probably this one: Is government not responsible for protecting Computer users from such Criminal Attacks (Cyber Crimes) ? Yes, they are and hence the International Constitution has framed some rules and regulations related to Computer Principles. If anyone violates this law, then he will be declared as a criminal in law. The action of Governments in the World against such big crimes (Cyber Crimes) is the formation of E-security Law &amp; IT Law. They are listed as below: E-Security  Cyber Laws And Information Technology Act: In order to safeguard the interests and to retain the faith of the Internet users, laws have been formulated to check criminal activities on the net. E-security is the discipline that addresses all the issues relating to the protection of data and information in all forms, the related technologies used for information processing, storage, communication and computer resources of an individual or an organization. Information Technology Law (IT Laws) is a set of recent legal enactments, currently in existence in several countries, which governs the process and dissemination of information digitally. These legal enactments cover a broad gambit of different aspects relating to computer software, protection of computer software, access and control of digital information, privacy, security, internet access and usage, and electronic commerce. A recent example of Information Technology Law is Indias Information Technology Act 2000, which became effective from October 2000. This Act applies to whole of India, and its provisions also apply to any offence or contravention, committed even outside the territorial jurisdiction of Republic of India, by any person irrespective of his nationality. In order to attract provisions of this Act, such an offence or contravention should involve a computer, computer system, or computer network located in India. Hope you all must have learned about the Cyber Crimes and the Computing Principles and take a step ahead towards your security and spread this message to others too. Do comment your experience and the various methods youve carried out for E-security."
