Transitioned to IT from an accounts payable job, I wanted a change of career and job, so I got an internship an a small company. The small company did some IT contracting work, and I started in helpdesk, then promoted to sysadmin/engineering, working with mostly windows, but other linux/unix OS and appliances as needed, LAN switches/routers/FWs, VPNs, etc. Then transitioned to a VoIP gig that leveraged a lot of my networking experience for things like traffic shaping, QoS, and other unified communications oriented technologies like softphones and call center scripting, But really increased my softskills gained originally in helpdesk, but also working with executives, engaging with new clients, building business relationships and transitioning organizations from POTS or digital PBXs to VoIP. I recently transitioned to a security consulting gig that was basically an advisor role(was advertised as an security engineer), and through a weird turn of events, had me managing a SOC team while working with things such as the RMF/CSF and other related frameworks, while also working on cloud architecture and building transition roadmaps from on-premise to cloud. There has been a lot in a short time, invaluable experience, good money, but I find myself interested in pentesting/security research. Aforementioned experience has taken place over a 10 year period. I have been practicing security on and off the books, reading actual books for fun, but this has mostly been as a hobby for the past few years. As such, I have been unsure how to break into the pentesting space without a severe paycut. I am supporting more than myself, so there are income levels that are essential to maintain. I have interviewed at several places for SOC analyst jobs to get my feet wet, and while the feedback I received was positive, the pay ceiling was for the roles were pretty low. I feel like it would be a dream job, to understand and subvert the inner-workings of technology, legally breaking in, and all the while, satisfying the semmaritian complex by helping to empower those with lessons on how I did so. I feel that my experience has been pulling me more into consulting/management, so part of me wonders if I should stick to that trajectory, since that is where the money is, or invest into going back down the technical route, enduring a paycut, and potentially building my skills to be competitive. I recognize the industrys attempt to flood the market with cybersecurity professionals to drive wages down, so a part of me wonders how lucrative working in the exciting pentesting/reversing/exploit development space will be in the next few years. Though because of how hard the field is, that is likely going to keep it lucrative. A tentative game plan is to start with automating a security lab, using it as a portfolio, write ups and blogs on research, and maybe focus my efforts on replicating research, and eventually building a portfolio of bug bounties and CVEs if I get to that level of skill. THEN/OR Look at joining a firm in a junior pentesting role, and growing within that or branching off as an independent researcher. I feel like joining a firm in junior role will bootstrap my experience faster, but will be financially impactful for a longer term, where as taking the lab/security research/portfolio/write ups and blogs might be safer, but take a longer time. Thoughts? Best path, alternatives, not enough info? Any feedback would be helpful, thanks!"

Outside of some basic Bash/Powershell tools, I do no CS related work at my current job (primarily compliance, vulnerability management, DLP, and perimeter security) I'm looking to move into a field in security that can utilize my coding skills and further develop them without leaving the career I've built here in cybersecurity. Does any such career exist? Thank you all in advance! [PS (optional read) my dream job is to be a security researcher and get some CVEs under my belt someday. I just want to continue both my security and code skills till I get there. Thank you for hearing me out!]"
