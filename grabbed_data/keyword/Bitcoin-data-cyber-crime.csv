The apprehended male trio, ranging from age 26 to age 55, allegedly exploited six different Bitcoin ATM machines, manipulating them to cough up the Hong Kong dollar equivalent of roughly $30,000 U.S. dollars, an article from the South China Morning Post detailed on Aug. 15. The alleged robbers took the cash out across 11 transactions. Authorities think the three males in question reportedly make up part of a larger criminal operation, the South China Morning Post article said. Two crypto exchanges tipped authorities off to the nefarious activity prior to the arrests. Wilson Tam, superintendent of Hong Kong's cyber security and technology crime bureau, did not divulge the exact thievery methods used, although the bureau did provide the two affected ATM businesses with tips on increased security measures. ""It is the first time we came across fraud linked to bitcoin ATMs,"" Tam said, as reported by the South China Morning Post. The number of Bitcoin ATMs in the world reached 8,000 in June 2020, while Bitcoin itself has gained further publicity as a viable asset over the course of the year, making the asset a logical target for attacks."

Grant West, 27 of Ashcroft Caravan Park, made most of his money through phishing scams targeting individuals and companies all over the world since 2015. He sold the personal data in different marketplaces on the dark web and convert the profits made from into cryptocurrency which he stored in multiple accounts, reported the police. Criminal Count Between July and December 2015, West ran a phishing scam masquerading as a takeaway ordering service called Just Eat. West carried out the attacks from a laptop belonging to his girlfriend and stored personal information, stored in a file called fulz of more than 100,000 people in the device. He completed over 47,000 sales from an online store, sold financial data and shipped cannabis to customers and how-to guides instructing others how to carry out cyber attacks. West pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to defraud, two counts of criminal property possession, possession of a Class-B drug with intent to supply, possession and offering to supply of a Class-B drug, and unauthorized modification of computer material among others. Victims will be compensated Officers from the Mets Police Cyber Crime Unit arrested and charged him in September 2017 after a two-year investigation. West was recognized as the head of an Organised Crime Network (OCN) that predominantly targeted London-based organizations. On May 25, West was jailed for 10 years and eight months. West was operating on the Dark Web under the pseudonym Courvoisier, the Met came to know in its lengthy police investigation, codenamed operation Draba. Following Wests arrest, about 1 million worth of cryptocurrency was seized from him that is currently valued at 922,978 (1,130,000 USD). The confiscated cryptocurrency, that West did not contest, will be now sold and the victims will receive compensation for the damage caused by the crimes committed by him. The MPS is committed to ensuring that individuals who are committing criminality on the Dark Web are identified, prosecuted and their criminal assets are seized, said Detective Chief Inspector Kirsty Goldsmith, head of the Metropolitan Police Service's (MPS) Cyber Crime Unit."

Running Margins Software ( I started off with Leonardo) with a very small amount circa $100AUD just to see how things work in the market. &amp;#x200B; I also bought a Trezor Model T of which via Coinbase I managed to put away circa 0.067 btc. &amp;#x200B; A few weeks ago, as I am about to start a Pentesting course for Veterans I decided to add a Proxmark RDV4 to my arsenal of devices. &amp;#x200B; So in general I was doing a sweep of the net, looking for where I could purchase an authentic Proxmark (not the Chinese version) and I came across [CoinFlipShop.com](URL . &amp;#x200B; They had the device for $450AUD + $25AUD for transport. I checked my Trezor, I had just enough to make the exchange. Now I didn't make the decision lightly, I spent a couple of days weighing should I keep my tiny little amount of bitcoin and wait for it to explode, or just use it for something I need to get an education with. So I made the purchase. I received a Receipt via Email saying the purchase had gone through, then I received 10 minutes or so later an email saying they cancelled the order. &amp;#x200B; They told me that it was cancelled due to Coinbase &amp; Shopify as a precaution due to some over payment scam. I just want the device I paid for. I was told it would be reinstated, that they would send the device with some kind of gift on the following tuesday, and so I waited. Nothing happened, I emailed multiple times. Was told be cause the transaction was cancelled they couldn't help me. &amp;#x200B; Well I got sick of arguing with him, especially when he came up with some bs about his Python API. I informed ACORN which is a kind of Govt Cyber Crime / Online Scam agency. Haven't heard boo about anything from them, and they do not promise to look into your complaint anyways. &amp;#x200B; So if anyone knows if that company is legit, then it would be appreciated if you know how to contact them via phone. Also anyone who knows how to trace the transaction I would appreciate a link or whatever to where I can place the transaction details from my Trezor into some kind of search engine on the blockchain.

12,cyber-crime,Bitcoin,The Department of Justice testimony in Congress was deceptive and misleading because Bitcoin did not exist in 2006. We need to continue to apply pressure ! Call your Senator !,7,7gbj9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gbj9z/the_department_of_justice_testimony_in_congress/,2017-11-29 18:34:03,"See bellow the Virtual Currency written testimony of the Department of Justice. *Source: URL (PDF)* &amp;nbsp; They are using as reference the Liberty Reserve case when at the time **Bitcoin did not exist.** **For the list of senators:** URL &amp;nbsp; &gt; **Virtual currencies.** Virtual currencies offer yet another alternative to cash. Criminals seek to use virtual currencies to conduct illicit transactions because they offer potential anonymity, since virtual currency transactions are not necessarily tied to a real world identity and enable criminals to quickly move criminal proceeds among countries. Some of those countries, unlike the United States, do not currently regulate virtual currencies and therefore have limited oversight and few AML controls. For example, in its 2017 National Drug Threat Assessment, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) concluded that China-based firms manufacturing goods used in trade-based money laundering schemes often prefer to accept payment in bitcoin, the most widely used virtual currency, because bitcoin can be used to anonymously transfer value overseas, thereby circumventing Chinas capital controls. Moreover, transnational criminal organizations are able to convert cash drug proceeds to virtual currencies through both licensed and unlicensed exchangers, and then transfer the virtual currencies to China to purchase Chinese goods. &gt;&amp;nbsp; &gt;Some internet sites using virtual currencies are promoted specifically for criminal use. For example, until the government shut it down in 2013, Liberty Reserve, which billed itself as the internets largest payment processor and money transfer system and allowed users around the world to send and receive payments using digital currencies, was used by online criminals to launder the proceeds of Ponzi schemes, credit card trafficking, stolen identity information, and computer hacking schemes. Liberty Reserves founder, Arthur Budovsky, built and operated Liberty Reserve expressly to facilitate large-scale money laundering for criminals around the globe by providing them near-anonymity and untraceable financial transactions. In 2016, Budovsky pleaded guilty to money laundering charges and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The Departement of Homeland Security is even better because they use Irrelevant facts to scare the Judiciary committee. None of those two are using Bitcoin to launder anything. These two cases are about drugs and not money laundering. **They are not using Charlie Shrem case.** *Source:URL &amp;nbsp; &gt; **Virtual Currency** &gt; &amp;nbsp; &gt; Many of the traditional transnational crimes that HSI investigates have begun to migrate to become cyber-enabled, with significant parts of the crime committed over the internet, including both the indexed internet and the unindexed dark web. Transnational crimes that HSI investigates, including child exploitation, drug smuggling, intellectual property rights violations, illegal export of firearms, and money laundering now all have cyber-enabled elements to them. This transition has paralleled the growth of e-commerce, generally, and poses challenges for law enforcement, in particular HSI and CBP. &gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &gt; In addition to the traditional complexities posed by conducting cyber investigations, many of the illicit activities conducted in cyber-enabled crimes are paid for with virtual currency, including both centralized and decentralized convertible virtual currencies. The latter are sometimes referred to as cryptocurrencies. Virtual currencies are not issued or backed by any sovereign nation, and are distinguished from fiat currency or real currency, which is the coin and paper money of a country that is issued and guaranteed by the country; designated as its legal tender; and circulates and is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the issuing country. HSI agents are increasingly encountering virtual currency, including more recent, anonymity enhancing cryptocurrencies (AECs), in the course of their investigations. AECs are designed to better obfuscate transaction information and are increasingly preferred by TCOs. Some illicit virtual currency exchangers have also begun to cater to TCO actors, including through the use of mixers or tumblers that anonymize virtual currency addresses and transactions by weaving together inflows and outflows from different users, further increasing the challenge to law enforcements ability to tie virtual currency transactions to real world individuals. &gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &gt; In November 2016, HSI special agents investigated and seized $1.2 million in cash from Utah resident Aaron Shamo, who led a Xanax and fentanyl pill production organization. Shamo sold his illicit products via the dark web, and an investigation led to the identification of his virtual currency wallet address. Through the use of Blockchain analysis tools, agents were able to identify Shamos Bitcoin transactions and seize bitcoins valued at approximately $2.5 million in U.S. dollars. Shamo was indicted in December 2016 and the subject of a supersceding indictment in May 2017. &gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &gt; In another HSI opioid smuggling investigation, Pennsylvania resident Henry Koffie was arrested in July 2017 and indicted with Distribution of a Controlled Substance Resulting in Death and Importation of a Controlled Substance. Koffie, a.k.a. NARCOBOSS, was a dark web vendor of fentanyl who filled more than 7,800 orders between July 2016 to June 2017, most of it paid for with bitcoin. HSI seized $154,000 from Koffies accounts. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **This prove that the pressure we are putting is working.** If they wanted to use AML cases they would have cited Murgio, Faeilla, Coztanzo, Wagner, Shrem, Steimetz, Manzy, Petix; or either Val Galerius (today awaiting trial in Florida) or DPR. &amp;nbsp; **CALL AND EMAIL YOUR SENATOR** and tell them to **Remove Digital Currency From Section 13 of S1241** and that DOJ and DHS testimony was deceptive, misleading and irrelevant because bitcoin did not exist when the Liberty Reserve was prosecuted and Irrelevant because none of the people charged where laundering money. &amp;nbsp; Theo Chino URL (for the list of senators)"

15,cyber-crime,Bitcoin,"For all intents and purposes, US has outlawed anonymity in money transfer.",9,6q5upf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6q5upf/for_all_intents_and_purposes_us_has_outlawed/,2017-07-29 04:45:23,"In 2013 Silk Road was seized. Ross lawyer [argued in 2014](URL that Ross could not be guilty of money laundering because bitcoin is not money, but property. The Judge [shoots down this argument](URL by stating that ""it's close enough to be considered money"". Ross lost the case and was sentenced for money laundering, among other things **Consequently: bitcoin is to be defined as money.** According to Title 18, United States Code, Section 1960, it's a crime to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. The term money transmitting includes &gt;""transferring funds on behalf of the public by any and all means"" Thus, all bitcoin wallets and exchanges (exchanges conducting $1000 or more business per day with one person) are required to register as a money transmitting business with the Secretary of the Treasury as required by a separate statue, Title 31, United States Code, Section 5330 and federal regulations pursuant to that statue. Registration as a Money services business (MSB) requires you to provide name and location of business and owners/operators. There are a lot of requirements as a MSB such as identity verification for transfer of certain sizes (Title 31, USC  1010.312), suspicious transactions reports (31 CFR 1022.320), having an US agent (according to C.F.R.  1022.380(a)(2)) etc. Let's look closer at what is written in the indictment of Liberty Reserve and BTC-E: **From the Liberty Reserve indictment:** &gt;In registering the user was required to provide basic identifying information, such as name, address, and date of birth. However, **unlike** traditional banks or **legitimate** online payment processors, LIBERTY RESERVE did not require users to validate their identity information, such as by providing official identification documents or a credit card. Account could therefore be opened easily using fictitious or anonymous identities. [...] &gt;As set forth above, LIBERTY RESERVE's system was designed so that criminals could effect financial transactions under multiple layers of **anonymity and thereby avoid apprehension by law enforcement**. Not surprisingly, LIBERTY RESERVE was in fact used extensively for illegal purposes, functioning in effect as the bank of choice for the criminal underworld. LIBERTY RESERVE users routinely established accounts under false names - including such blatantly criminal monikers as ""Russia Hackers"" and ""Hacker Account"". Believing themselves to be protected by this anonymity, LIBERTY RESERVE users then engaged in criminal transactions with an impunity that would have been impossible in the **legitimate financial system**. Liberty Reserve was found in violation of Title 18, USC, Section 1956(a) (2) (B) (i) (Money Laundering) and the owner was sentenced to 20 years. **From BTC-E indictment:** &gt;BTC-E was an international money-laundering scheme that, by virtue of its business model, catered to criminals - and to cybercriminals in particular. Through VINNIK's effort, BTC-E emerged as one of the principal means by which cyber criminals around the world laundered the proceeds of their illicit activity. &gt;BTC-E lacked basic anti-money laundering controls and policies and, as such, was attractive to those who desired to conceal criminal proceeds as it made it more difficult for law enforcement to trace and attribute funds. [...] &gt;The defendants and their co-conspirators [...] intentionally created, structured, and operated BTC-E as a criminal business venture, one designed to help criminals launder their proceeds [...] &gt;Those engaged in criminal activity using BTC-e gravitated to BTC-e because of the site's lack of anti-money laundering and ""Know-You-Customer"" processes in place that could have them reported to the government. Criminals who used BTC-e to launder funds were also willing to go to the extra trouble of wiring money offshore to entities that operated through shell companies. The business model of BTC-E was simply being an exchange. And one without identification requirements (at least for crypto-only transactions). It is here stated that this model, by virtue, is catering to criminals. It seems clear as day to me that they are trying to make association between privacy (anonymous transactions) and unlawfulness. Claiming that anonymity is ""catering"" to criminals, that is partaking in the facilitating of funds from unlawful activity or in other words: money laundering. Based on these cases, it appears you can not run a system as such in good faith while accepting US customers. As the target audience for such system ""must"" be criminals. Doing it regardless, will very likely result in a money laundering charge, or worse. If we wish to not partake in this US so called ""justice system"" we must exclude US customers. Now herein lies the problem: How do you exclude US customers? You can block US IP's, but US individuals will still be able to reach your site through Tor, VPN or other means. I would argue that this is simply not enough. Take this quote from the btc-e indictment: &gt;42. BTC-e made a series of self-serving public statements. designed at least in part to deflect the attention of law enforcement and regulators. For example, despite advertising on their website that ""we don't accept any more international . wire transfers from US Citizens or from US Bank. This, too, was false. Through its elaborate funding mechanisms, BTC-e did in fact knowingly accept wire transfers from banks in the U.S. and made by U.S. citizens. Now imagine that BTC-E did block US IPs, how could the indictment look instead: &gt;42. BTC-e made a series of self-serving public statements. designed at least in part to deflect the attention of law enforcement and regulators. For example, despite advertising on their website that US IPs were blocked and no US customers allowed, they simultaneously allowed a back entrance for US customers though the onion network, a network in large used by criminals to hide from law enforcement. How is that going to sound in court? No problem you say. Let's also block Tor. Fine, but then there is VPN providers. You can't block all the VPN providers, that would be an infeasible large task. Will it hold up in court as ""good enough""? Well, life sentences are being thrown out left and right in the land of the free. Are you willing to risk your life on that? Do you trust the US justice system enough to take that risk? I sure am not. That leaves us here. With the only option to require KYC of all customers. That is, zero anonymity. Bye bye privacy. Unfortunately it does not end there. US customers can submit fake documents. I would argue that it is therefore necessary to also do webcam sessions with each customer, if anything to show good faith, and that you have tried your very best to stay outside of US jurisdiction. This has enormous costs and removes a big advantage from your business, for yourself and your customers. Please note, I am no legal expert, and I have only scratched the surface here. So many laws it would take me months to ply through them. I was only looking at examples from real life, and the laws used to prosecute those. But I think, for all intents and purposes, it is illegal to run an anonymous money transmitting business. I would be delighted to be proven wrong."
16,cyber-crime,Bitcoin,Danish police have developed a way to track Bitcoin-transactions to individuals,6,6ucjvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6ucjvs/danish_police_have_developed_a_way_to_track/,2017-08-18 05:53:43,"The following is a translation i made of page 20 and 21 of [this document](URL by the danish police. I did my best with the translation, hope it's alright. **TL;DR:** Danish police have found a way to identify individuals using the Bitcoin currency on the deep web. They have shared the information with the FBI, DEA and all Europol countries, and probably some more. They expect to be able to take down international drug syndicalists, (thats what they said) using this new method. A couple of danish individuals have already been arrested for purchasing drugs on the deep web. **Introduction** Danish police was remarkably surprised, when they last year could present Europol to a breakthrough in IT, that makes it possible to identify criminals who trade with narcotics and weapons on the dark web. So far the criminals have been able to successfully hide their footprints by making use of the digital currency Bitcoin, but thanks to Danish police that is no longer a risk-free method, as proven by two sentences from Denmark. The police-hiveminds curiosity and understanding of connections combined with the scientists thoroughness and deep insight. That was the cocktail necessary to reach a breakthrough in the hunt on criminals, making illegal transactions on the internet and paying in the digital currency Bitcoin. The discoveries have been shared with the Europol-countries, FBI, DEA and more. Our main focus is to get the method spread to every country in the world, so we can finally start chasing the international criminal syndicates. We dont want to shine in Denmark alone, because we know how we can breathe the criminals on their neck, on the Dark Web, says Kim Aarenstrup, central leader for the National Police Cyber Crime Center (NC3). **High-teach team at work** Not long ago, police research came to an end if the criminals were using bitcoins when they traded illegal goods, typically on the Dark Web. The police didnt have the necessary knowledge or tools to identify who were behind the transactions. Even though the indices could be strong against one specific individual, the necessary proof couldnt always be raised in court. After a meeting in Europol in 2015 about bitcoin, the central chief Kim Aarenstrup returned with a smile on his face to his high-tech team in NC3, consisting of a mixture between police-people and IT-people. On the meeting in Europol, Kim had been presented to a model that was able to analyze and find connections between transactions with bitcoin  so-called blockchains. Though without being able to identify who was behind the transactions. - I asked my people to take a closer look at the method. They scratched their necks and then proceeded to go in-depth and research the topic, says Kim Aarenstrup. The police- and IT-people was by cooperating able to further develop the concept, beyond the already existing software-tools on the market, among others some analytical tools. - It is technically very advanced, but I wont try to explain the technical details of the method, because that would mean helping the criminals, Kim says with a smile on his lips.

17,cyber-crime,Bitcoin,"From what I've learned speaking with insurers, there is no way that any exchange in the world has sufficient insurance coverage against the loss of bitcoin holdings or other digital currency held on behalf of customers.",5,5mzz19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5mzz19/from_what_ive_learned_speaking_with_insurers/,2017-01-10 07:05:59,"This includes wallet vendors, merchant providers, remittance providers, or any kind of bitcoin or digital currency business that custodies digital assets whatsoever. Why? 1.) it is extremely expensive 2.) the maximum that could possibly be insured is $40MM worth of bitcoin assets. The only insurance that exists to cover bitcoin is 'cyber-crime' coverage. How expensive is insurance coverage for a business that wants to insure against the theft/loss of their bitcoin holdings? Try somewhere around $120-150k/year for only $5MM in bitcoin holdings. That's over $10k/month, which means an exchange would have to do north of 200BTC/day in volume just to cover insurance costs. Doubtful that even any exchange has sufficient coverage. As an example, the Bitfinex hack stole $60MM in bitcoin. No wonder they didn't have any way to pay out to their customers. Just that $60MM would have cost the exchange $1.5MM/year to fully insure. There's no way any existing exchange would or could pay that kind of fee. So if an exchange claims to have coverage, they are likely not telling the whole truth."

The following describes the coverage secured under XL Group: ""The customized insurance product, exclusive to BitGo, was structured in collaboration with XL Group and Innovation Insurance Group, LLC. It is a robust cyber and professional liability policy that goes well beyond narrow crime policies previously adopted by some bitcoin vault providers. BitGo customers who opt-in to the program are protected from acts, errors, or omissions of BitGo technology, processes, and employees, including external hacking incidents and employee theft. Both hot wallets and cold storage are eligible for coverage in the policy. In the event of a covered loss, the policy would reimburse BitGos customer, as a direct loss payee, for the value of the lost or stolen bitcoins, subject to the terms and conditions of the insurance policy with XL Group. "" Keyword here is ""external hacking incidents and employee theft"". Based on the language here it would appear that the policy should cover the theft of funds, even if it was due to negligence on behalf of a BitFinex employee. The full announcement can be found here: URL Some customers on BitFinex were large players and had funds in excess of $1m. This was evident during market events where large bid walls or sells walls in excess of 1000 btc were placed. These larger customers will not be reimbursed their full amount based on the $250k coverage limit. We can assume that at minimum $20m of the hacked funds is ineligible for coverage, meaning an estimated claim of $50m would need to be paid. Lastly, can the insurer bear the burden of such a large claim? XL Group is a publicly traded company with a market cap in excess of $9b. They have roughly $8b net of premiums and can sustain a claim of $50m. URL "

I would caution CoinWallet.EU against their ""stress tests"" are at risk of breaching UK law and probably cyber crime laws elsewhere. Any individual or business affected may contact the police and the evidence of the attacks is burned into the blockchain forever and various publications who have covered the story with direct contact from coinwallet.eu representatives. EDIT: It seems there is a bit of confusion, so I'll cover some of the concept here. There is a concept in most legal jurisdictions that abuse or unauthorised use of computer systems/networks is an offence. In the case of abuse, if one intends to cause disruption and then attempts to do so, then an offence has been committed. Whether a computer system is vulnerable to attack is not the point and is not a defence. Penetration testing is illegal without explicit permission from the owner of the computer system in question. Many people have conflated the Bitcoin network with nodes. If an attacker executes a denial of service it affects bitcoin nodes. There are two specific examples: DOS attacks against nodes, as it happening with XT, and the transaction attacks that have been executed by Coinwallet.eu. In both examples the DOS attacks have a negative impact on the computer running the full node, as well as the functionality of the full node. The XT attacks consume bandwidth and the transaction attacks fill node mempools and cause nodes to crash. This post is not about political values, it's about the law, as it stands. The attacks on XT nodes and the ""stress tests"" are illegal actions and those performing them should think twice. Of course getting caught is a different matter, certainly the XT attackers have not come out publicly, so hunting them down may pose a challenge. Coinwallet on the other hand has made no attempt to hide their intentions and I assume there is a trail leading right back to them. As a matter of law, I urge attackers to cease operations. I'm quite shocked that some of the reddit community would condone these illegal actions or chose to politicise the matter. I know I am not alone in my feelings and I would like to thank /u/mike_hearn for actually bringing up the matter of the legality of attacks a few days ago on the XT mailing list. Unfortunately for him, the attackers of XT nodes are pretty well hidden. While I do not remotely support XT, or BIP101 (I'm quite vocal against them), I absolutely do not condone the illegal actions, however so motivated. I think there are better ways to let the Bitcoin ecosystem decide it's future. In any case, this post it not about XT or the blocksize debate, but about the illegality of the recent and planned attacks.

I was hacked sometime ago and a fair share of BTC (to me at least, about 10 to 15) were stolen from my PC which had a virus downloaded off usenet by me (yes I know, I'm an idiot...but still a victim). A Wallet Stealer was used to steal my BTC and transfer to another BTC address. This BTC address has a ton of history and good information left behind in traces on the web. So I was able to nail down a name, a bunch of pseudonyms, email addresses, physical addresses, IP addresses, forum posts, etc etc etc ...to a fair degree of certainty to identify someone. This guy has HACKER written all over him. So I know who my attacker/thief is, but I'm not in a position to do anything about it. I have compiled all my research and submitted a IC3 complaint (I didn't go to the local police, they would laugh at me haha). I've also been in contact with exchanges this attacker has sent/received from (thanks to some ninja investigative skills), and they have actually been pretty reactive and helpful (even spoke to a COO). Now they just said to wait to hear back from the authorities...which I hope leads them to my IC3 complaint, or the other way around. Anyone have any contacts in the FBI/IC3 or some other cyber crime affiliated organizations (both US and international)? Maybe they can escalate my IC3 complaint or hear my story. I've reached out to the attacker asking him politely to return my BTC; no response. reddit, even if you can't help me, then maybe some publicity will lead to something. We can't let these types of guys get away...not only is he a shit-bag of an individual, but it's also bad for bitcoin in general...they devalue our currency. They'll go to BTC-E to sell em or buy gift card with the bitcoin, purchase goods and then re-sell for USD/fiat. It's a black market activity at that point. This guy is a criminal and this isn't his first offense. TLDR: was hacked, lost a bunch of BTC, have lots of info and I am waiting hopelessly to hear back from someone who can help. PS.
