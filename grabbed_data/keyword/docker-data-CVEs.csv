I come into a big number of vulnerblites and CVEs varying from low to medium to critical. What comes to my mind when i saw this is to apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade &amp;&amp; apt-get dist-upgrade but still the vulnerable libraries are there and not updated to the new version !! this is the first part of my query. The second part is regarding the Vulnerblilits in libraries that are not fixed wet such as this: [URL what is the best mitigation to do in this case? Many thanks."
1,CVEs,docker,How are you doing container security in your CI/CD pipelines?,1,dwor6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/dwor6v/how_are_you_doing_container_security_in_your_cicd/,2019-11-15 21:08:04,"Hi, somebody doing container compliance/vulnerability scanning in your CI/CD pipelines with a free SaaS/without a server component? I would like to implement a secure CI/CD chain for all my projects on github (.e.g. [URL where I for now only do container vulnerability scanning in a pull request. e.g. [URL &amp;#x200B; * This fails the build job, but no feedback to the PR (yet). How does everyone do this? Whitelist CVEs? * How does anyone scan images already deployed? &amp;#x200B; Bonus points for Github Actions stuff. :-)"

I am just starting a new gig at Anchore after 5 years at Ansible, and I wanted to share a post by my colleague Christian. We just released a new blog outlining how to use open source tools to scan your Docker images for vulnerabilities and CVEs: URL Take a peek if you like, thanks for the consideration. If you have questions, let me know."
3,CVEs,docker,The Debian docker image is way better than it looks ....,48,77ota3,https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/77ota3/the_debian_docker_image_is_way_better_than_it/,2017-10-21 07:25:53,"When you look at the Debian docker image in a CVE scanner it is usually full of entries, most of which are just noise that make the image look a lot less secure than it actually is. We just pushed a blog that talks about this explaining why you see so many CVEs and why they aren't in fact an issue .... URL"

Updates to [Anchore.io](URL include: The updates made to the previous Navigator service include: - Private Repositories: Allowing you to setup private repositories to be scanned by Anchore. - A Graphical Policy Editor: The new graphical policy editor allows you define your own custom policies and map which policies are used with which images. The policy editor supports CVE whitelisting - allowing a curated set of CVEs to be excluded from security vulnerability alerts. - Expanded Notifications: In addition to image update notifications the Anchore Navigator can now alert you by email when CVEs have been added or removed from your image and when the policy status of your image has changed, for example an image that previously passed is now failing policy evaluation. Your feedback would be extremely helpful, so if you have a minute head over to [URL and take a look Thanks!"
