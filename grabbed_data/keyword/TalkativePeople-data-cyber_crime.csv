This is absurd. So when given statistics and data on who is being subjected to hate crime right now, today, your reaction is to not do anything about it because doing anything would mean it'll become a ""victimhood measuring contest""? It's not about need, the important part of that poll is the should be able to. We don't trust the state with the power to censor without damn good reason. Someone getting offended isn't going to cut it. Law enforcement reported 5,084 hate crime offenses as crimes against persons. By offense type: 44.9 percent were intimidation. 34.3 percent were simple assault. 19.5 percent were aggravated assault. 0.7 percent consisted of 15 murders and 23 rapes. (See Methodology for more details about changes in the definition of rape in the UCR Program.) 1 offense was reported as human trafficking, commercial sex acts. 0.5 percent involved the offense category other, which is collected only in NIBRS. [URL An attacker who voiced his hatred of women and people of color in a manifesto before killing six people in California in 2014 signaled a new type of terrorist. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups, called the attacker the first alt-right killer. Several more attackers who fit this profile killed over the next few years. Then in 2017, attacks jumped in a tense post-election political environment. Nine of these proved deadly. Preliminary 2018 data for the United States shows five additional deadly white extremist attacks, including mass shootings at high schools in Florida and Texas and at a Pittsburgh synagogue. [URL It's so cute that you think people assaulted or murdered or raped or killed is just someone getting offended. Unless I'm using my speech to call for direct immediate physical harm to another human, this is literally impossible. You don't have to. People can kill themselves because of your hate and violent speech. Sexual-minority youths residing in neighborhoods with higher rates of LGBT assault hate crimes were significantly more likely to report suicidal ideation (P = .013) and suicide attempts (P = .006), than were those residing in neighborhoods with lower LGBT assault hate crime rates. We observed no relationships between overall neighborhood-level violent and property crimes and suicidality among sexual-minority adolescents (P &gt; .05), providing evidence for specificity of the results to LGBT assault hate crimes. [URL A total of 33 eligible articles from 26 independent studies were included, covering a population of 156,384 children and young people. A total of 25 articles (20 independent studies, n=115,056) identified associations (negative influences) between cybervictimization and self-harm or suicidal behaviors or between perpetrating cyberbullying and suicidal behaviors. Three additional studies, in which the cyberbullying, self-harm, or suicidal behaviors measures had been combined with other measures (such as traditional bullying and mental health problems), also showed negative influences (n=44,526). A total of 5 studies showed no significant associations (n=5646). Meta-analyses, producing odds ratios (ORs) as a summary measure of effect size (eg, ratio of the odds of cyber victims who have experienced SH vs nonvictims who have experienced SH), showed that, compared with nonvictims, those who have experienced cybervictimization were OR 2.35 (95% CI 1.65-3.34) times as likely to self-harm, OR 2.10 (95% CI 1.73-2.55) times as likely to exhibit suicidal behaviors, OR 2.57 (95% CI 1.69-3.90) times more likely to attempt suicide, and OR 2.15 (95% CI 1.70-2.71) times more likely to have suicidal thoughts. Cyberbullying perpetrators were OR 1.21 (95% CI 1.02-1.44) times more likely to exhibit suicidal behaviors and OR 1.23 (95% CI 1.10-1.37) times more likely to experience suicidal ideation than nonperpetrators.

Russia recently proved that freedom of speech can be used against western countries, with brexit and the trump election. Free speech matters for a healthy political system, but you can't just defend free speech without admitting you have to raise the level of the political debate. It's easy to use free speech to pull everything down to fight in the mud. If you let online platform being pulled in the mud and targeted by state actors and other private interests, without moderation or proper monitoring, free speech will be used as a weapon. And by monitoring, I'm not talking about a thought police, but at least being aware of what happens on those platforms, or at least regulating the security of who can create accounts, from which country, are they a verified user, how trustworthy an account can be, etc. Cyber is so unregulated and mainstream it makes it incredibly easy to use it as a media platform. /u/PenisShapedSilencer"
2,cyber crime,TalkativePeople,"/u/Thaddeauz on ELI5: Why does the US have so many federal law enforcement agencies, many with overlapping objectives instead of having just one or two for all crimes?",1,c5xcps,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkativePeople/comments/c5xcps/uthaddeauz_on_eli5_why_does_the_us_have_so_many/,2019-06-27 08:47:28,"Well first of all, they don't really have overlapping objectives, they usually have their own speciality, but on they overlapping on the edge of their speciality. For example, a drug cartel can do kidnapping or do organized crime activities.  You see, the larger an organisation is, the harder it is to manage, stuff like corruption or overblown bureaucracy make that organisation bigger, more slow to adapt, it have more inertia and that's not really something you want for your law enforcement. The US is big with 300+ millions of people and that mean that if there was just one federal agency it would be huge. This also give the advantage that you can have specialist. A small community will have a couple of cops doing everything, while a city will have their patrol, detective unit, maybe a Swat team, and a large city will have their own helicopter unit and such. So when your federal agency become big enough, there is usually a speciality that become their own organization. Because it's easier to manage and it make a difference when the top brass have experience in that particular speciality. So for example in Canada we have the RCMP that does a large portion of the federal law enforcement, but it also have 30 thousand employer to cover the population of 37 millions. In the US have a similar size at 35 thousand people, but they cover a population of 327 millions, so they have a more specific role.  Now for the overlapping, like I said it's not really overlapping as much as you seem to think. - The FBI specialize in counter terrorism, counter-intelligence, cyber attack, public corruption and civil right. - The DSS specialize in travel document and diplomatic asset security. - The IRS-CID specialize in tax fraud. - Each branch of the military have their own Criminal Investigation and Intelligence agency, but that's like every military. - NSA specialize in signals intelligence and processing of data. - US Mashals specialize in fugitive and protection of Judget, Witness, etc. - US Secret Service specialize in VIP protection and currency counterfeiting - ICE specialize in illegal immigration. - Customs and Border Protection specialize in border control - CIA specialize in counter terrorism and intelligence operation abroad.  So as you can see, they all have their own specialization, but yes during investigation overlap can happen, during which usually end up with one agency taking the leadership, while other support it. - /u/Thaddeauz"

Because who are we relying on to provide accurate stats (by this I mean accurate to reality, not accurate inasmuch as this is what the justice system processed) ? The very same people who are discriminating in the first place! It's way easier to just say ""well, blacks obviously just do more crime!"" rather than attempt to look at the structural and systemic problems that might cause a higher apparent crime rate. You can attempt to extrapolate from self reported rates of crime - but this is always fuzzy and error prone (take rates of pot smoking for example. Similar levels of use, but black people get arrested for it way more and do more time for it - this is apparent because the rate in the justice system versus the self reported rates are so different as a function of ethnicity) As for the stats, I guess we're at an impasse then heh, coz I'm exhausted due to chronic illness, I cannot justify looking for detailed stats for this when its late in the day when I'm most tired, sorry. /u/\_zenith"

You made it sound like the amount of crimes were equal just that white people didnt get arrested as much. I was only asking for the jail time one. Ill look it up later. I agree the higher crime rate is because of issues like poverty. I just dont think government should necessarily do to much to help. Im not 100% sure as I think a negative income tax/ubi would be good. Help you get better with that illness and no worries man. /u/Oppresed

Do you believe there is an injustice here based on social group? That an injustice is specifically targeted at black people (whether they personally identify as such or not)? ******** If you said yes to those questions, then there is grounds to treat black drug offenders differently to achieve a just outcome (ie have our justice system take police bias into account when charging or sentencing, etc). One might say apply a social justice approach. If you dont think there is an injustice here, than we need to have a broader conversation about what justice means before getting into any nuance about social justice. /u/elliottpayne"

Both of those items are worthy of high praise, yet get a small blip in the news. With 24 hour news on cable and on the internet, sensationalism is needed to keep the ratings up or get ones karma high. The saying used to be ""if it bleeds, it leads"", now it is easier to make the news. A good example is WBC, which is about a dozen people.

Just use the sliders to compare how far left the Dems have gone in the last 8-10 years. The left left me has been a very common phrase among your average political pedestrians. Post natal abortions wasnt an invention of the right. Most people think thats too far. Social-constructivist theory of gender wasnt an invention of the right. The push for open borders isnt an invention of the right. The unanimous opinion among almost all Dem candidates to give illegal immigrants healthcare wasnt an invention of the right. LA, San Fran, Seattle, and Portlands rampant homelessness and drug crisis wasnt an invention of conservative legislatures. It was democratic policies in super majority Dem legislatures which caused this dynamic to get worse and worse over the last 10 years. It wasnt conservatives who invited millions of refugees into Europe after the Syrian crisis, it was Macron and Merkel. This rise of the far right in Europe was absolutely predictable given the wreckless influx of so many unassimilable migrants so quickly - small European towns went from 4000 to 12000 inhabitants over night. People didnt have a say in this - they were told to deal with it or well call you Xenophobic. Same exact situation for people living in southern Arizona, New Mexico and SoCal. Theyre tired of bearing the brunt of open border liberal policies and being labeled by liberal elites as backwards, when those who push for open borders rarely bear the real life consequences of their easy virtue signaling. Hence the push to send migrants to sanctuary cities. So this anti-SJW mindset is not limited to the Internet, its happening all over the world. Its much broader an issue than you seem to think. Studying the fight between the citizens of LA, SanFran or Seattle with their legislatures really does sum it all up - people are tired of the rise of rampant drug abuse, homelessness, and crime, but the legislatures are too afraid to crackdown on anything because most of them scared to not seem progressive enough. Carrots only go so far without sticks. Needle exchanges, harm-reduction programs, and compassion-based polices only go so far on their own. These cities have become magnents for all kinds of social rot, a whopping 95% of homeless being addicted to meth or heroin. Thats what unchecked signaling of progressive values can lead to, especially by legislators who rarely have to step foot on that side of town. /u/Incrediblyreasonabl3"

Youre off the mark in describing what I want. Id assume as much from many of my peers. We can set reparations aside. On a personal level, at minimum, I would like to stop being gaslit about the disparities in our community. As in please stop with the single moms, ghetto, gangster rap stuff (whether from you or from politicians). There are problems in the black community that can be attributed to _bad choices_, but no one acknowledges the circumstances of those choices, nor the extremely limited options (ie every choice ahead is a bad choice, what choice would you make between crime and homelessness or starvation?). Black people are excluded from jobs and careers all the time, its illegal sure, but didnt meet qualifications is fully legal. Cant get access to institutions that provide qualifications because of lack of transportation is also legal. So on and so forth. Ever give or receive the advice that its not what you know, but who you know? Of course you have. And if you havent, its 100% true and 100% legal. So even when you meet the qualifications, you can get passed over for work because you _just didnt know the right people._ These are facts. Id like to not be gaslighted about them. Bringing it back to government and institutions. I would like our government to acknowledge that these disparities still exist and are a direct result of slavery, rather than blocking bills that would even allow the study of the impact. [source](URL The government offers direct and indirect support all the time. The GI Bill, child tax credit, mortgage interest deduction, and any number of programs that were created to grow the middle class, especially post WWII are all examples. This wasnt the government encouraging people to pick themselves up by their boot straps, this was direct investment from treasury into peoples pockets to establish the middle class. Set race aside and make sure you commit to memory that the narrative of hard work leading to good outcomes for people is a fiction. The growth of the middle class, especially post war, was **heavily** subsidized by the government. And Im sure you hate nepotism as much as I do. Besides reparations we could (off the top of my head): - invest heavily in education - expand public transportation infrastructure (huge for economic mobility) - create more career pathways by investing in work/education programs (ie apprenticeship) - build more affordable housing - lower the cost of health (lets not get into this one here) Like I said, Id love to get creative with other collaborators. How would we pay for it? With The rigorous process we used to pay for the recent tax cuts... a strong belief that the costs will be offset by the value creation that these policies add to society. /u/elliottpayne"
