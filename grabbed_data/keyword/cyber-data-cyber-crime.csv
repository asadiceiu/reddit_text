However, with the adoption of _Cyberspace as the preferred descriptor of _The_Fifth_Domain of_Warfare_ by the __US__Department_of_Defense_ in the 1990s, __Cyber__ has been redefined to refer to the very concept of information itself. In addition to Land, Sea, Air, &amp; Space, __Cyberspace_ encompasses ""the _notional__environment_ in which communication over computer networks occurs."" _Cyber_ is a metaphor for the digital world, where new rules are currently being written, where nation-states/corporations have _little__control_ over the actions of their users and even less control over information, and where both information and warfare flow in many directions. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

According to a security expert, they often have to get creative when ""cashing out"" or laundering the money they have stolen. It takes a network to defeat a network! And by the looks of it, we are most definitely heading towards a more virtual world, virtual dollars and virtual currencies, creating a more reliable approach in making transactions via cryptocurrencies :) "
3,cyber-crime,cyber,I think I experienced a cyber crime while employed in a major sports league and need help understanding what happened.,0,8xmu68,https://www.reddit.com/r/cyber/comments/8xmu68/i_think_i_experienced_a_cyber_crime_while/,2018-07-10 18:04:42,"This turned out longer than I initially planned -- sorry in advance for the essay. The main reason I'm posting this story is because I want to figure out what really happened. I still have the system logs, network activity, Slack conversations, and several screenshots from the night I mention. I don't know how much of it is relevant, but if there's something in there that someone with iOS or network security can decipher, I would want to talk to them, if only for my own sanity. There are things that happened here that are my own fault, and due to my technical naivety. I'm just looking for advice on what my options are and to understand the situation, not a reprimand for the poor decision-making. About 2 years ago, I was working at a media/tech company under the umbrella of a major sports league when this happened. The league's tech side (~2000 people) acquired the software company I worked at (~50 people) in fall 2015. This was my first job right after college in summer 2015 and I was officially hired as the merger was announced. I work in UI design, and my software and IT knowledge was lacking at the time. I was bringing my personal macbook to the office, and doing most of my work through there for a few months. After the company was acquired, I continued to do so. My work laptop was several years old and too slow for Adobe software that I was using daily. Around late spring of 2016, I started noticing unusual behavior on my work laptop. Recent searches appearing that I never typed, new Spotlight search recommendations like Activity Monitor and Network tools, apps accessed that I never use, files opened that I rarely access. One example is with the Dropbox app - my personal account was connected to my work computer, and I noticed my selective sync settings kept changing to sync my personal folders, which I explicitly made sure to exclude. I had to keep changing them almost daily. I ended up staying late one Friday night to try to fix it. I thought changing my work computer permissions would stop it, and surprise, it stopped working after that genius idea. I still had my personal computer with me, which I started using at that point. I pinged a coworker on Slack who confirmed that the company does indeed have remote access to our machines through Meraki, and that he uses Little Snitch to block access. He sent me the link to it and I downloaded it. He suggested I boot the work laptop into single user mode to fix those permissions and sent some links to help. At this point, it's 9pm and there's a dev who's also staying late. I tell him what's going on with the permissions and all and he sends me other links, and tells me to run those commands to fix it. None of them work or really change anything. I attempt to call our company 24/7 IT support but it goes to voicemail. I message a few more people on Hipchat, but no one can really help. Eventually, I drive directly home. Once I get home, I see this Little Snitch tool constantly pinging me on my personal machine, but can't recall what the notifications said. I changed some of the settings, which might've have opened some kind of door. Windows start popping on my screen for system settings and I hear that apple lock sound open, which I quickly click to counteract. Essentially, I go into panic mode and start defending my computer against all these attacks which are happening seconds apart. Notifications that looked inauthentic and almost like a fake Apple UI with blurry icons keep popping up requesting my password, which I try to exit from (relevant later). At some point in the night, I booted into recovery mode and saw what looked like another drive, or some kind of connection, that was accessing to my computer. I could see their recently viewed files and saw that my Dropbox folder was being viewed. The only folder I was was able to see in their directory before they disconnected was called Power Management. I tried to create a Firmware password but I think it was too late at that point. The password I setup wasn't even letting me in. When I called Apple after the Firmware lockout, they asked me if my operating system was bootleg, and doubted the authenticity of my operating system. I end up taking it to the Apple store that day and I remember the CS agent sounding genuinely concerned on the phone. I have no idea why they would think my operating system was inauthentic and I can't really explain how that would happen. I got in the office late that following Monday and was really distraught after messing up both my work and personal computers. The IT guy gave me a loaner machine to use in the meantime. I am still seeing the activity I saw on my original work machine that prompted my suspicion in the first place like the recommended Spotlight searches of network activity files and Activity Monitor that never came up in the past. I end up looking into system logs and console activity and not really understanding what I'm looking at, but I still save it. It starts getting really late at this point, like 2 am and I am there alone. And this is the really fucked up part when I start to hear noises throughout the office. Two women talking to each other like they're having a conversation. They're whispering to each other, and I can't make out what they're actually saying, but it's loud enough that I can hear it. I start walking around the office trying to find where it's coming from, but I can't find the source, as I'm the only one there. After going back to my computer, I realize what's going on right now is that there is someone actively mirroring my display and viewing my screen via an Apple TV or other possible connected devices. At just the right moment, I'm able to change settings and see their their desktop, completely different from mine. It quickly goes back to my screen as they disconnect. I also realize there's a remote connection via a Mac Mini, and I was able to view their widgets screen. None of this would ever on this computer before. As I walk back to my desk, I see one of the employees walking away in the distance towards his house, the same guy who sent me links on changing permissions. At this point it's 7am and the receptionist is making coffee. I start to hear people talking again coming from an office near the main door. As I walk towards this office, the receptionist enters through the main door, and is walking towards me in the opposite direction. There is a burst of laughter, very loudly and clearly, from that office I'm about to walk into. The receptionist and I both look at each other and I say explicitly, ""You heard that, right?"" and she confirms that she did and we both see no one there. I go back to my desk and see the first dev arrive. When I walk away from his area, I hear the first voices I heard of the women. This time, I can clearly hear her say, ""Is she gone?"" and when I approach, the dev is just standing over someone's empty desk responding when there's no one else there. Like he's speaking into a mic or something. I wonder if this was all just a sick prank and if this all of those sounds were being sent on some kind of speaker. There is much more that happened afterwards regarding HR, an attempt to escalate the issue, and verbal harassment until I had no choice but to quit. All of this raises some very disturbing questions... although management is allowed to monitor employees, at what point does it become malicious behavior? And who was it that kept viewing mirroring my display when I was there that night? I believe what was happening in my situation was malicious. What I'm asking in this post is how would one go about proving this in various system logs, what do I need to show, who would I even talk to to confirm this? For instance, when I saw the screen change to the mirrored desktop, is there a specific process I can look at in system logs to show this was happening? It seemed like whoever was remotely connecting was not part of the IT or management, who I assume would have those types of privileges. And even then, I doubt how ethical it is to cast someone's screen on an Apple TV, as opposed to using the proper software. To me, this seems like a crime, and I want to know how to prove that. I'm not sure if this is the proper subreddit for this story, and looking for all the help I can get, so I'll be posting to similar channels as well. TLDR: While working at my former job, I experienced remote connections to my computer. I saved log files and online conversations and want to understand on a technical level what happened and who I can talk to about this."
