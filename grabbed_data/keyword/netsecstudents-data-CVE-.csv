As of April 2020, there appear to be two fully maintained branches of the framework. The Ramsay malware/toolsets are heavily focused on both persistence and data exfiltration from air-gapped environments. The original version of Ramsay was distributed via maliciously-crafted office documents. These documents were distributed via email, and were designed to exploit CVE-2017-0199 to facilitate the installation of the malware. CVE-2017-0199 is a remote code execution flaw in Microsoft Word. Specifically, it allows attackers to retrieve and launch code, including VBS &amp; PowerShell upon launching of a specially-crafted RTF document. Later versions of Ramsay (aka v2.a / 2.b) were distributed as trojanized installers for well-known applications (ex: 7zip). These later versions also included an aggressive spreading mechanism, which locates PE files (local and network adjacent) and infects them to allow for further spreading in targeted environments. Along with the spreading capabilities, Ramsay includes multiple techniques for maintaining persistence. These include: DLL Hijacking AppInitDLL Registry Key Entries Scheduled Tasks [URL"

10,CVE-,netsecstudents,Help me design a college course!,3,6u4ail,https://www.reddit.com/r/netsecstudents/comments/6u4ail/help_me_design_a_college_course/,2017-08-17 05:04:22,"Hey Reddit, I have a rare opportunity to take an independent study this fall and it is up to me to design the course and the topics covered. I would love some feedback on my first draft. First some background: I'm going into senior year in pursuit of a B.S. in Computer Engineering Technology. I have experience working with html, css, javascript, php, sql (mysql &amp; postgre), c, c++, visual basic, and some light experience with java/jsp. I've designed several websites in my spare time and for school including a login/registration system, database manager similar to phpMyAdmin (yet not nearly as good), a web chat, and several smaller static websites. Also I've done quite a bit with the LAMP stack and an introduction to MS Server where we learned about DHCP, DNS, Active Directory, and group policy. On the networking side I took two courses, one of which was working with all Cisco gear (routers/switches), basically a pre-cursor to the CCNA certification. We learned how to use Cisco IOS to configure router/switches, how sub-netting and IP addressing works, and how LAN/WAN networks can be configured. The Independent Study I would like to do is a continuation of some of the topics I've learned so far but with a security focus from a programming standpoint. The following is my weekly breakdown: Week 1. Introduction to the course, discussion about topics covered. Review on basic Internet Protocols. Week 2. Continued review on internet protocols, sub-netting, switching and routing. Week 3. Introduction to website/web-server security. Week 4: Analysis of website attack vectors. SQL Injection, XSS, MITM, CSRF. Week 5: Login system security, user authentication. Week 6: Database security and Encryption. Week 7: Project 1 / Midterm Presentation Week 8: Understanding CVE (Common Vulnerabilities &amp; Exposures) standards. Week 9: Setting up a secured virtual lab environment. Week 10: Introduction to Kali Linux OS and software. Week 11: Introduction to penetration testing. High level overview. Week 12: Penetration testing continued: Planning, reconnaissance and scanning. Week 13: Penetration testing continued: exploitation and post-exploitation. Week 14: Penetration testing wrap-up: Reporting results. Week 15: Project 2 / Final Presentation I am thinking each week I will do some hands on experience with each topic, whether it be research an existing system or create a system and show where weak points can occur. I have broken it into two parts, Week 1-6 on programming secure websites followed by a midterm project. This is the area I have more experience in and wanted to give myself time to acquire some hardware for part 2, which I have little experience in and would like to learn more. Part 2 is pretty self explanatory and consists of penetration testing networks. In addition I am thinking of a few final projects including working with my schools IT department to do a phishing awareness campaign, or if they will allow, performing a full penetration test on their network. Let me know what you think!"

Do they first wait for something or someone to flag it malicious, then download the sample and reverse engineer and/or run it, and then somehow come up with the conclusion that by looking at that particular URL sequence, he or she has a Magnitude, Neutorino, etc. EK sample at hand?"
