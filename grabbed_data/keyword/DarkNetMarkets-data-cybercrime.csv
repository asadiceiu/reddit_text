0,cybercrime,DarkNetMarkets,Operation Bayonet: This is how HTCU took Hansa Market offline,6,84x4jq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/84x4jq/operation_bayonet_this_is_how_htcu_took_hansa/,2018-03-17 04:20:35," The Dutch High Tech Crime Unit expertly assumed control over the underground website, Hansa Market. Operation Bayonet, a multinational law enforcement operation, proved that Hansa Market undeservedly felt safe on the darknet. The story behind pulling Hansa Market down started a couple months earlier along with another a critical marketplace on the darknet, Alphabay. The HTCU got signals that the FBI was involved with a key operation in regards to AlphaBay, and saw an opportunity to join the action with an investigation that was then being led against Hansa Market. However, around that time, the police were at that point completing a lot of research into Hansa, with a server in the Netherlands which necessitated a jurisdiction to look at it. The research started in 2016 when the team received tips from the European Cybercrime Center of Europol and from security company Bitdefender that servers from Hansa were once hosted in the Netherlands. After the framework seemed to be migrated through Lithuania by means of an alleged Mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT), the police figured out to coordinate with the investigative services in Lithuania. This gave the police access to all data from Hansa Market right away. THTC team leader, Petra Haandrikman in an interview with security analyst Brian Krebs said, it would have been easy to pull down the website right then and there; yet when we heard that the FBI had its own research we concocted a much better idea. As indicated by Haandrikman, the FBI needed AlphaBay going offline to resemble an exit scheme for the users, where it would seem that the owners have suddenly gone away with all bitcoins. Haandrikman also said that our idea was to carry things a step further and give the darknet markets an extra blow. Users at that point felt that they were basically heading to an alternate market, yet in actuality, they were running against the police. This was trailed by an intriguing operation called Bayonet. Haandrikman added; we got physical access to the machines in Lithuania, and we figured out how to bunch those servers with our own servers in our own country. This enabled us to effectively duplicate the website without taking the websites offline, so no one could know it. Along these lines, we kept an ongoing duplicate of the database constantly while transferring the code from the website. Due to that, it came to a period while we were replicating them when the website was running on two servers. Since that time, the police had full access to all transactions through the site, all messages, IP addresses and even passwords of buyers and traders. Moreover, when the FBI pulled down AlphaBay, the anticipated mass migration, in fact, took after. Explicitly, we called the new visitors AlphaBay refugees. We temporarily needed to stop the registration of new visitors because accompanied by the visitors were such a huge amount. This additionally prompted scenes where users offered their current Hansa Market accounts for sale on Reddit. However, the police figured a way to watch out for all users for over a month through the operation. After thirty days the website was at last closed down and a major cautioning went to all visitors including a report with nicknames and residences that, the site had been taken over. People who missed the announcement were surprised with the way in which the THTC reported the operation and the media attention that the unpredictable approach globally produced. This made the main aim of Operation Bayonet appear to be successful and revealed drug vendors as not completely anonymous on the darknet. Also, a vital piece of the success of Operation Bayonet, unexpectedly, concerns the poor security efforts by the victims. The greater part of the sellers who migrated from AlphaBay or Hansa to Dream Market after the advancement held the same usernames, passwords, and PGP keys. In any case, this needed to do with the significance of reputations on such sites thus, after the advancement, sellers do not want to lose their users and begin again with building up a reputation. In the interim, many studies are constantly being conducted on Dutch users of the site thus, both sellers and buyers themselves. Data was additionally transferred to foreign investigation services. Due to the present investigation, the police would not yet state how the real identities of users have come, THTC leader Haandrikman suggested. Nevertheless, the police have given up 1,158 seized bitcoins to the Public Prosecution Service. URL"

Not trying to do any FUD activity. And I'm aware that this may not directly affect the community (I mean who uses WhatsApp anyway?) BUT.. it's an example of possible future breaches. Anyway, carry on: *PRESS RELEASE JANUARY 18, 2018 Mobile Devices Compromised by Fake Secure Messaging Clients  Hundreds of Gigabytes of Data Stolen San Francisco  The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and mobile security company Lookout have uncovered a new malware espionage campaign infecting thousands of people in more than 20 countries. Hundreds of gigabytes of data has been stolen, primarily through mobile devices compromised by fake secure messaging clients.* *The trojanized apps, including Signal and WhatsApp, function like the legitimate apps and send and receive messages normally. However, the fake apps also allow the attackers to take photos, retrieve location information, capture audio, and more.* *The threat, called Dark Caracal by EFF and Lookout researchers, may be a nation-state actor and appears to employ shared infrastructure which has been linked to other nation-state actors. In a new report, EFF and Lookout trace Dark Caracal to a building belonging to the Lebanese General Security Directorate in Beirut.* *People in the U.S., Canada, Germany, Lebanon, and France have been hit by Dark Caracal. Targets include military personnel, activists, journalists, and lawyers, and the types of stolen data range from call records and audio recordings to documents and photos, said EFF Director of Cybersecurity Eva Galperin. This is a very large, global campaign, focused on mobile devices. Mobile is the future of spying, because phones are full of so much data about a persons day-to-day life.* *Dark Caracal is part of a trend weve seen mounting over the past year whereby traditional APT actors are moving toward using mobile as a primary target platform, said Mike Murray, Vice President of Security Intelligence at Lookout. The Android threat we identified, as used by Dark Caracal, is one of the first globally active mobile APTs we have spoken publicly about.* *Dark Caracal has been operating since at least 2012. However, one reason it has been hard to track is the diversity of seemingly unrelated espionage campaigns originating from the same domain names. The researchers believe that Dark Caracal is only one of a number of different global attackers using this infrastructure. Over the years, Dark Caracals work has been repeatedly misattributed to other cybercrime groups. In fact, EFFs Operation Manul report from 2016 misidentified espionage from these servers as coming from the Indian security company Appin.* *One of the interesting things about this ongoing attack is that it doesnt require a sophisticated or expensive exploit. Instead, all Dark Caracal needed was application permissions that users themselves granted when they downloaded the apps, not realizing that they contained malware, said EFF Staff Technologist Cooper Quintin. This research shows its not difficult to create a strategy allowing people and governments to spy on targets around the world.* ______ More about Dark Car..carcarcarel... Carcarel? WTF is a Caracel?

Operation Dragon focused on human trafficking, illegal immigration, cocaine trafficking, heroin trafficking, synthetic drug trafficking, cybercrime, weapon trafficking, counterfeit trafficking, MITC fraud, and variations of organized crime. Europol and Frontex coordinated the placement of thousands of law enforcement officers at hundreds of locations during 2017. The series of targeted actions took place between June 5 and October 20. The aim of the operation, Europol wrote in their press release (Scribd link), was to disrupt crime in the sectors mentioned above. Europol provided a summary of the actions taken during the operation. Below are some of the actions in a summarized form. Global Airport Action Day Sixty-six countries, 84 airlines, 230 airports, and Europol, Eurojust, AMERIPOL, CLACIP, INTERPOL, Frontex, NCFTA, and UNODC launched a global action against online ticket fraud. Europol wrote that fraudulent ticket purchases often have ties to more serious crimes. The joint action launched on June 5 and ran through June 9. The participants repeated the action on October 16 through October 20. This part of the operation resulted in the arrest of 153 suspects. Cyber-Patrolling Week Between June 12 and June 16, 2017, 25 countries completed the first ever coordinated action week to counter the evolving criminality on the Darknet. The action focused on assorted cybercrime and darknet drug trafficking. More than 40 specialists listed 272 actors for identification. Law enforcement agencies selected 73 to investigate at a greater length. Europol reportedly discovered that 42 actors cross-matched across the targeted crime sectors. Large-Scale Joint Action Day (LS-JAD) All 28 European Union member states, five outside countries, CCWP, INTERPOL, MAOC-N, and Europol focused on human trafficking, cocaine trafficking, and OPC between October 9 and October 13. Law enforcement arrested 692 people and opened almost 400 new drug trafficking investigations. The authorities seized 267 kilograms of cocaine, 19 kilograms of amphetamine, almost two kilograms of MDMA, and 327 ecstasy tablets. Joint Action Day Calibre Europol, Frontex, and 18 countries helped Europol seize 136 firearms between November 17 and 18. Europol provided analytical on-the-spot support. In addition to the weapons, the action resulted in the seizure of 7,000 rounds of ammo. Only 18 individuals landed in custody as a result of the action against illegal firearm trafficking. Operation Dragon was not Europols only operation during 2017. In July, they caught 76 suspected fraudsters as a result of eCommerce Action 2017. And in May, Europol warned the public that the Dark Web Is The Heaven For Organized Criminals In The EU. URL"
4,cybercrime,DarkNetMarkets,[Article] The Bitfury Group Unveils Solution For Analyzing Related Bitcoin Addresses,3,7opqeb,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/7opqeb/article_the_bitfury_group_unveils_solution_for/,2018-01-07 20:27:51,"URL From the article: AMSTERDAM  January 4, 2018  The Bitfury Group, the worlds leading full-service Blockchain technology company, and its world-class global development team today detailed a new solution to help reveal relationships between bitcoin addresses that minimizes errors in data and ensures greater accuracy in linking bitcoin addresses for criminal investigations, while also showing bitcoin users ways to protect their privacy. Currently, bitcoin users can have multiple addresses, making it easier to conceal identities and commit crimes on the Blockchain. The ability to link related addresses, called clustering, is an important new tool that helps law enforcement agencies conduct criminal investigations, said Valery Vavilov, CEO of The Bitfury Group. Bitfurys award-winning engineers have come up with an incredibly innovative and novel approach to analyzing transactions on the Bitcoin Blockchain. The Bitcoin Blockchain has the potential to be a strong force for good, and this new method will help ensure that it lives up to that potential by aiding investigations and reducing criminal activity. Criminals are increasingly learning the Bitcoin Blockchain is not the place for them. Having a traceable public ledger of every bitcoin transaction ever conducted allows law enforcement to follow the money in a way that would never be possible with cash. Criminals should run, not walk, away from bitcoin. And thanks to Bitfury, today they should be running away even faster, said Jason Weinstein of Steptoe &amp; Johnson LLP, a Bitfury strategic advisor and former Deputy Assistant Attorney General in charge of cybercrime at the US Department of Justice. Bitcoin address clustering is a process that exposes bitcoin users by determining which addresses belong to a single user through an analysis of Blockchain data. The act of clustering groups those addresses together, enabling investigators to link them to a single entity. In a new report, Bitfury reveals a comprehensive approach to clustering that reduces errors in results. While prior algorithms constructed clustering models using Blockchain information and validated it with off-chain data, such as public information on the Internet, Bitfurys new method uses both data types during the model construction step. The proposed approach allows investigators to reduce errors in unreliable input data sources and achieve a higher level of accuracy. Tests performed by Bitfurys technical development team confirm that the new approach produces more accurate results than methods that analyze Blockchain data only. Approaches that are based solely on Blockchain data tend to produce erroneous connections, but combining this data with information from off-chain sources filters out these errors. The paper is the authors version of the article that was presented December 18, 2017, at the IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications. To see the algorithms developed by the Bitfury team, read the full white paper here.

5,cybercrime,DarkNetMarkets,Research: 47% Of All Bitcoin Transactions Involves Illegal Trading Mostly On Darkweb,19,7pdesl,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/7pdesl/research_47_of_all_bitcoin_transactions_involves/,2018-01-10 16:14:33,"Talis Putnins and Jonathan Karlsen, Professors at the University of Technology Business School in Sydney, together with Dr. Sean Foley from Sydney University, have been jointly working on a research whose results are shocking. In their yet to be published document Sex, Drugs, Darknet and Bitcoins, the nearly half of all bitcoin transactions involve illegal trading either directly or indirectly on the dark web, a section of the internet that cannot be accessed using the a standard search engine. Access to the dark web is made possible via the Tor browser that allows the users to surf without giving away the identity of the location from where the login has taken place and hence a safe marketplace for criminals. Individual logins and all transactions are masked and not indexed. With the help of the dark web and bitcoin anonymity, Bitcoin is being used actively in buying and selling of illegal goods and services. This includes money laundering, cybercrime activity, illegal Drugs and weapons trading, terrorism financing, human trafficking, child pornography, illegal internet and software gambling and theft of the Bitcoins themselves from their anonymous owners virtual wallets. The researchers used forensic finance techniques and blockchain technology which still has greater promise in almost all industries. They established a unique method of filtering out illegal bitcoin transactions by first analyzing the trade networks of already known illegal activity; using information scraped from the darkweb. The team then went about a study of dark web and bitcoin cases that have been closed, by tracking criminal activities of bitcoins users from a global database since 2009, and who had in the past been arrested by law enforcers and other federal agents in online crimes. Most people believe that bitcoin is highly untraceable and that its anonymity is by far beyond law enforcers but looking from a closer distance and digging a little dipper is astonishing, says Prof. Putnins. We were able to come up with characteristics that can be used to clearly differentiate [between a bitcoin used in a] users involved illegal activity from those using legally, he added. The main reason for our research is to aide law enforcers and regulators to at least have an idea of what is expected of them and how to control, monitor and regulate bitcoins used globally and how to do it as it becomes mainstream, says Putnins. This method developed by professionals can be used by law enforcers and authorities to trace online criminals, surveillance activities on the dark web and to analyze other blockchains. It is now possible to analyze the extent at which one tries to hide and conceal their identity and their transaction records. Using these two methods makes it possible to approximate the size of the darknet market facilitated and associated to illegal activities involving Bitcoins. In the hands of regulators or federal police, our methods potentially provide a lot of value in understanding what is going on and cracking it down, Putnins concluded. "

The recent takedown in July 2017 of Alphabay and Hansa, two of the largest darknet markets, is an example of how law enforcement can intervene to disrupt this environment. Despite this positive achievement, those involved in the online drug trade appear to be resilient to such disruption and able to re-organise rapidly. European-level cooperation and intelligence sharing, along with the targeting of high-impact vendors, will be critical in countering this threat. &gt;According to the report, market disruption should form part of a broader, more integrated set of measures implemented as part of an overall strategy to address drug trade in the darknet ecosystem. Darknet investigation teams, modelled and promoted by Europol, will be at the heart of such an integrated strategy. Engagement with key industries (e.g. information technology, social media, payment and product distribution services) will be increasingly important for identifying and responding to new threats in this area. There should be some interesting times ahead. I have not read the report fully but it surely will be an interesting read."

17,cybercrime,DarkNetMarkets,15 Years in Prison for Darknet Heroin Supplier,24,6vcmc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/6vcmc5/15_years_in_prison_for_darknet_heroin_supplier/,2017-08-23 03:33:24,"URL According to United States Attorney Josh J. Minkler of the Southern District of Indiana, the supplier of a nationwide drug distribution ring will spend the next 15 years in prison. Pierre Burnett, Jr., aka Doe, the owner of Epic Ultra Lounge, pleaded guilty to the charges in a four count grand jury indictment from 2016. The indictment accused Doe of conspiracy to distribute heroin, conspiracy to distribute cocaine, heroin distribution, cocaine, distribution, and money laundering conspiracy. His sentencing came as a result of an intrusive investigation into Indianapolis area drug dealers. Doe, according to the press release, distributed a grand total of 37 pounds of heroin and 55 pounds of cocaine. He purchased the drugs from contacts in Mexico who received payment via couriers. These couriers met with Doe after an exchange in order to receive paymentbags filled with cash. The investigation, according to the narrative provided by the federal government, began during the Silk Road. Federal agencies looked into a man from Indiana that had landed on the United States Postal Inspection Services radar for drug trafficking. USPIS agents flagged his mail, and thereby allowed the DEA to fully investigate. The DEA and IRS identified Lee Gray, the USPIS suspect, as a Black Bank and Silk Road vendor. Gray aka Supremesmoke sold heroin and used multiple bank accounts under various names to accept payment. The IRS agents, as with IRS agents in effectively any law enforcement investigation, followed the money trail from Grays vendor account to a Bitcoin exchange. From there he deposited money into several bank accounts. And he used some of the money to purchase heroin from Doe. USPIS involvement has become a usual element of darknet investigations. At one point, though, such investigations were new and USPIS agents believed the use of the mail system violated the sanctity of the seal, according to E.C. Woodson, Postal Inspector in Charge: The U.S. Postal Inspection Service takes very seriously its mission to deter the illegal use of the mails for any criminal activity and [] to identify, investigate and bring to justice those who would attempt to mask their criminal activity through the use of the mail thereby violating the sanctity of the seal. Federal law enforcement caught another heroin dealer: Alan Duncan aka Al Gore. Duncan sold out of Southern Ohio. He too bought from Doe. Duncan is currently serving 12 years in prison and Gray is awaiting sentencing. The investigation into those two men led directly to the arrest of Burnett (Doe). Burnett, working as the supplier for several drug dealers in the area, received a 15 year sentenceonly three years more than Duncan. Gone are the days when criminals could cloak their drug trafficking activity behind the anonymity of the Dark Web, the US attorney said. Our office is committed to ferreting out and prosecuting individuals engaged in cybercrime in all its many forms. All law enforcement agencies involved gave statements. Unsurprisingly, the statements matcheddown to the letterthe statements given in other darknet cases. They all boiled down to we will get you; you have nowhere to hide now. "

WE WILL HAVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND OTHERS OUT IN A FEW MOMENTS. MR. SESSION: GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. I'M ESPECIALLY WANT TO WELCOME YOU -- U.S. ATTORNEY PHIL TALBERT FROM THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. HE HAS DONE GREAT WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT CASE. ANOTHER SPECIAL WELCOME TO YOUR POLL DIRECTOR ROBERT WAINWRIGHT WHO TRAVELED HERE FROM THE NETHERLANDS TO BE WITH US TODAY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS IMPORTANT CASE OF WHICH VARIOUS COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD HAVE PARTICIPATED. ROB, WE APPRECIATE YOU, WE HAVE TREMENDOUS RELATIONSHIPS WITH EUROPOL, WE WORK WITH THEM ON A DAILY BASIS, AND THIS IS THE KIND OF ACTIVITY AND INVESTIGATIVE WORK WE MUST DO IN THIS DAY AND AGE BECAUSE CRIME KNOWS NO QUARTERS. AMONG OTHER CHALLENGES, OUR GREAT COUNTRY IS CURRENTLY IN THE MIDST OF THE DEADLIEST DRUG EPIDEMIC IN OUR HISTORY. ONE AMERICAN NOW DIES OF A DRUG OVERDOSE EVERY 11 MINUTES. MORE THAN 2 MILLION AMERICANS ARE ADDICTED TO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. TODAY, SOME OF THE MOST PROLIFIC DRUG SUPPLIERS USE WHAT IS CALLED THE DARK WEB, WHICH IS A COLLECTION OF HIDDEN WEBSITES THAT YOU CAN ONLY ACCESS IF YOU MASK YOUR IDENTITY AND YOUR LOCATION. IT IS CALLED DARK, NOT JUST BECAUSE THESE SITES ARE INTENTIONALLY HIDDEN. IT IS ALSO DARK BECAUSE WHAT IS SOLD ON MANY OF THEM, ILLEGAL WEAPONS, STOLEN IDENTITIES, CHILD PORNOGRAPHY, AND LARGE AMOUNTS OF NARCOTICS. TODAY, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ANNOUNCED THE TAKEDOWN OF A DARK WEB MARKET ALPHA THIS IS THE LARGEST TAKEDOWN IN WORLD HISTORY. ALPHA BAY STAFF MEMBERS CLAIM THIS GROUP SERVERS TO MORE THAN 40,000 A LEGAL VENDORS, PEOPLE WHO SELL ILLEGAL PRODUCTS, FOR MORE THAN 200,000 CUSTOMERS. BY FAR, MOST OF THIS ACTIVITY WAS IN ILLEGAL DRUGS, POURING FUEL ON THE FIRE OF A NATIONAL DRUG EPIDEMIC. AROUND THE TIME OF THE TAKEDOWN OF THIS SITE, THERE WERE MORE THAN 250,000 LISTINGS FOR ILLEGAL DRUGS AND TOXIC CHEMICALS ON ALPHA BAY. MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF ALL LISTINGS ON ALPHA BAY. AS OF EARLIER THIS YEAR, 122 VENDORS ADVERTISED FENTANYL. 238 ADVERTISED HEROINE. WE KNOW OF SEVERAL AMERICANS WHO WERE KILLED BY DRUGS ON ALPHA BAY. ONE VICTIM WAS JUST 18 YEARS OLD WHEN IN FEBRUARY SHE OVERDOSED ON A POWERFUL SYNTHETIC OPIOID WHICH SHE HAD BOUGHT ON ALPHA BAY. THE DRUG WISH IT TO HER HOUSE THROUGH THE MAIL. A LITTLE MORE THAN A WEEK AFTER HER DEATH, A VICTIM IN ORANGE COUNTY, FLORIDA DIED OF AN OVERDOSE FROM A DRUG BOUGHT ON ALPHA BAY. THEN THERE WAS GRANT SIEVER, ONLY 13 YEARS OF AGE, A STUDENT AT TREASURE MOUNTAIN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL, UTAH, PARK CITY. WHEN HE PASSED AWAY, AFTER OVERDOSING ON A SYNTHETIC OPIOID THAT HAD BEEN PURCHASED BY A CLASSMATE ON ALPHA BAY. THE ABILITY OF THESE DRUGS TO SO INSTANTANEOUSLY END THESE PROMISING LIVES IS A REMINDER TO US OF JUST HOW INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS THESE SYNTHETIC OPIOIDS ARE. ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE PURCHASED ANONYMOUSLY FROM DARK PLACES ON THE INTERNET. THIS IS LIKE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS OF THIS ENTIRE YEAR. I HAVE NO DOUBT OF THAT. MAKE NO MISTAKE, THE FORCES OF LAW AND JUSTICE FACE A CHALLENGE FROM CRIMINALS AND TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS WHO THINK THEY CAN COMMIT THEIR CRIMES WITH IMPUNITY BY GOING DARK. THIS CASE PURSUED BY DEDICATED AGENTS AND PROSECUTORS SAYS YOU ARE NOT SAFE. YOU CANNOT HIDE. WE WILL FIND YOU. DISMANTLING ORGANIZATION AND NETWORK, AND WE WILL PROSECUTE YOU. I BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE OF THIS OPERATION, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SAFER. PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD ARE SAFER TO SAVE HER FROM THE THREAT OF IDENTITY FRAUD AND MALWARE AND SAVE HER FROM DEADLY DRUGS. BUT THE DEPARTMENT WORK IS NOT FINISHED. WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIND, ARREST, PROSECUTE, CONVICT, AND INCARCERATE CRIMINALS, DRUG TRAFFICKERS, AND THEIR ENABLERS, WHEREVER THEY ARE. THE DARKNET IS NOT A PLACE TO HIDE. WE WILL USE EVERY TOOL WE HAVE TO STOP CRIMINALS FROM EXPLORING VULNERABLE PEOPLE AND SENDING SO MANY AMERICANS TO AN EARLY GRAVE, PERPETUATED BY THE TECHNOLOGY. I WANT TO THANK OUR INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS AT EUROPOL AND IN THAILAND, THE NETHERLANDS, LITHUANIA, CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, FRANCE, AND GERMANY, ALL OF WHOM HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH US TO TAKE DOWN THIS CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE. AND TO ALL THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL, AT THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION, FBI, AND THOSE AT THE IRS, CRIMINAL INVESTIGATORS, ATTORNEYS AND STAFF, ALL OF WHOM WORKED TIRELESSLY ON THIS CASE. YOU HAVE MADE US PROUD. YOU HAVE MADE THIS COUNTRY SAFER, AND WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR. ROSENSTEIN: THANK YOU, ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I'M GRATEFUL TO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS AND PROSECUTORS FOR THEIR TIRELESS WORK ON THIS CASE AND TO OUR INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS FOR THEIR SHORT IN EVERY CORPORATION. THE ALPHA BAY CASE IS PART OF A LARGER INTERNATIONAL EFFORT TO ATTACK DARK WEB MARKET BASIS. THEIR ALLEGED CONDUCT CONDUCT INCLUDES SELLING ILLEGAL DRUGS LIKE FENTANYL AND HEROIN, AS WELL AS STOLEN FRAUDULENT IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENTS AND ACCESS DEVICES, COUNTERFEIT GOODS, MALWARE IN COMPUTER HACKING TOOLS, FIREARMS, AND TOXIC CHEMICALS. THIS WAS A COORDINATED INTERNATIONAL OPERATION AGAINST ALPHA BAY AND ANOTHER WEBSITE WHICH THE DUTCH AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING AND SHUT DOWN EARLIER TODAY. AS PART OF THIS OPERATION, THE DUE SITE ADMINISTRATORS WERE ARRESTED AND AUTHORITY SEES EXTENSIVE EVIDENCE AND ILLICIT ASSETS RELATED TO THOSE ENTERPRISES. THIS CASE STARTED WITH SEVERAL INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS AND WE HAD THE ASSISTANCE OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES REPRESENTED HERE, AS WELL AS SEVERAL U.S. ATTORNEY OFFICES. WE JOIN TOGETHER WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS TO COORDINATE THE TIMING OF THE TAKEDOWN OF THESE WEBSITES. THE ALPHA BAY TAKEDOWN AND ARREST OF ITS ADMINISTRATOR COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF OUR INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS. THAT IS ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS CASE TODAY. WE WORKED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES IN THAILAND, THE NETHERLANDS, LITHUANIA, CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, FRANCE, AS WELL AS SUPPORT FROM EUROPOL. WE WILL HEAR FROM THE EUROPOL DIRECTOR THIS MORNING. THERE WERE MANY MOVING PARTS TO THIS INVESTIGATION. ALLEGED MEMBERS OF THE CONSPIRACY USED ANONYMIZING TECHNIQUES TRYING TO CONCEAL THEIR IDENTITIES AND LOCATIONS. PEELING BACK ONE THERE AFTER ANOTHER TOOK US TWO NEW COUNTRIES WHERE WE NEEDED ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE FROM OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. WITH EACH DEVELOPING IN THE CASE, OUR INTERNATIONAL COLLEAGUES EXPRESSED A WILLINGNESS TO ASSIST. DARK WEBSITES LIKE ALPHA BAY AND OTHERS RUN ON WHAT IS CALLED THE TOUR NETWORK. HIDDEN SERVICES DESIGNED TO CONCEAL INFORMATION THAT COULD REVEAL THE LOCATION OF A WEBSITE AND ITS CUSTOMERS. PEOPLE USING THESE WEBSITES BELIEVE THEY WILL BE ANONYMOUS, BUT THIS CASE DEMONSTRATES THAT IS NOT ALWAYS TRUE. MANY DARK WEBSITES OPENLY TRADE IN NARCOTICS, GUNS, IMAGES OF SEXUAL ABUSE OF CHILDREN, AND OTHER SERIOUS CRUEL CONDUCT. AN ACADEMIC STUDY FOUND THAT THE LARGEST SINGLE CATEGORY OF HIDDEN SERVICES ON THE NETWORK WAS FOUR RUNS FOR THE SALE OF DRUGS AND CONTRABAND. IT ALSO FOUND 80% OF TRAFFIC RELATED TO SEXUAL EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN. SOME SITES HAVE MEMBERSHIP OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF USERS ACROSS THE GLOBE. THOSE DISTURBING STATISTICS EXPLAIN WHY DISRUPTING AND DISMANTLING DARK WEBSITES IS A PRIORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. INTERNATIONAL CORN NATION IS CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS. ADMINISTRATORS AND USERS OF DARK WEBSITES USE ANONYMIZING TECHNIQUES TO THWART LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES. OUR AGENTS, PROSECUTORS, ANALYSTS, AND SUPPORT STAFF WORKED TIRELESSLY TO LOCATE THE INFRASTRUCTURE HOSTING THE SITES AND IDENTIFY THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM. THESE METHODS PROVEN ONGOING CHALLENGE FOR US. HUNDREDS OF SITES ON THE NETWORK STILL ENABLE A VAST AMOUNT OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY TO OCCUR BUT WE ARE PROUD OF THE ACCOUNT IS THAT WE ANNOUNCED TODAY AND RECOGNIZE OUR WORK IS NOT DONE. WE FACE MANY CHALLENGES AND READING INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE TO OVERCOME THOSE CHALLENGES. EXCEPTIONAL FOREIGN CORPORATION WITH OUR OPERATION TO ATTACK A LEGAL ACTIVITY ON THE DARK WEB DEMONSTRATES INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH US TO DENY SAFE HAVENS AND CYBERCRIME. THAT HELPS US TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY, SAFETY, AND SECURITY OF ALL AMERICANS. ONE OTHER DEVELOPMENT I WANT TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION, FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF THE DEFENDANT CHARGED IN THE AMERICAN CASE, OUR U.S. ATTORNEY AND EASTERN CALIFORNIA FILED A CIVIL COMPLAINT WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT APPROPRIATE ACTION IS TAKEN WITH REGARD TO ALL THE ASSETS THAT WERE SEIZED IN THE COURSE OF THAT INVESTIGATION. THIS TIME I WANT TO DEDUCE THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE FBI, AND INDICATE. MR. MCCABE: GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE. THIS IS A LANDMARK OPERATION. ALPHA BAY WAS ROUGHLY 10 TIMES THE SIZE OF THE SILK ROAD, SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MULTIPLE SERVERS, DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CRYPTO CURRENCY, IN A DARKNET DRUG TRADE THAT SPAN THE GLOBE. IT TAKES A LOT OF COORDINATION AND A SHARED PURPOSE TO PULL OFF AN OPERATION LIKE THIS, SO WITH YOUR PATIENCE, I LIKE TO THANK A FEW OF THE FOLKS WITH WHOM WE WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY. FIRST, I'D LIKE TO THANK THE FBI SACRAMENT OF FIELD OFFICE WHO TOOK THE LABORING OR IN MAKING THIS OPERATION FOR SUCCESS. I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK OUR FOLKS IN THE ATLANTIC, PITTSBURGH, PHILADELPHIA, CHICAGO FIELD OFFICES, AS WELL AS THE FBI'S CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION AT HEADQUARTERS, CYBER DIVISION, AND LEGAL OFFICES OVERSEAS. THESE TEAMS DID AMAZING WORK AND WE ARE UNDER NO ILLUSION THAT WE DO THIS TYPE OF WORK ON OUR OWN. WE ARE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL TO OUR PARTNERS IN THAILAND, THE NETHERLANDS, LITHUANIA, CANADA, THE U.K., FRANCE, AS WELL AS OUR PARTNERS IN EUROPOL. WE WANT TO THANK HOURS PARTNERS-- OUR DUTCH PARTNERS IN TAKING DOWN THE WEBSITE TO WHICH MANY OF THE ALPHA BAY USERS AND VENDORS FLOCKED AFTER THE DEMISE OF ALPHA BAY. TAKING DOWN TO MAJOR DARK SITES AT ONCE IS CONSIDERABLE AND IT TOOK A LOT OF EFFORT, A LOT OF EXPERTISE, AND TEAMWORK. AS THIS LEVEL OF TEAMWORK AND COORDINATION SHOWS, WE WILL GO TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH TO FIND THESE PEOPLE AND TO STOP THEM. THERE ARE SOME CRIMINALS THAT THINK OF CYBERCRIME AS A FREEBIE . A THINK THEY WILL GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE THERE ARE TOO MANY PLAYERS AND TOO MANY COUNTRIES DO THEY THINK THEY WILL GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE THE SCHEMES ARE TOO COMPLEX AND BECAUSE THEY OPERATE IN THE SHADOWS. BUT WE ARE BLENDING TRADITIONAL INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES AND NEW TOOLS TO BRING THESE INDIVIDUALS OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND INTO THE LIGHT. THE FBI'S HIGH-TECH ORGANIZED CRIME UNIT TARGET CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES THAT CONDUCT TRADITIONAL CRIMINAL ACTIVITY LIKE MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE SALE OF ILLICIT GOODS THROUGH COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET. TOGETHER WITH FOLKS FROM THE CYBER DIVISION, VOMIT CRIME, CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN PROGRAMS, WE ARE WORKING TO GET EVEN THE GET BETWEEN COMPUTER INTRUSIONS THAT TARGET OUR DATA AND TECHNOLOGY, AND TRADITIONAL CRIMES FACILITATED BY TECHNOLOGY, LIKE THE DARKNET. THIS TEAMWORK TO LEGITIMATE TO IDENTIFY THE LOCATION OF THE ALPHA BAY INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO IDENTIFY THE ADMINISTRATOR, AND TO SHUT DOWN THE SITE ARE GOOD. CRITICS WILL SAY AS WE SHUDDER ONE SIDE, ANOTHER WILL EMERGE. AND THEY MAY BE RIGHT. BUT THAT IS THE NATURE OF CRIMINAL WORK. IT NEVER GOES AWAY, YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY KEEP AT IT, AND YOU HAVE TO USE EVERY TOOL IN YOUR TOOLBOX. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WILL DO. WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT OVER THE YEARS ABOUT TAKING DOWN INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL SYNDICATES, AND THAT SAME EXPERIENCE APPLIES TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE FACILITATED ON THE DARKNET. WE KNOW THAT REMOVING TOP CRIMINALS FROM THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT A LONG-TERM FIX. THERE IS ALWAYS A NEW PLAYER WAITING IN THE WINGS READY TO FILL THOSE SHOES. IT IS LIKE DEMOLISHING A BUILDING. HACKING AWAY AT INDIVIDUAL WALLS AND BEAMS ONLY DOES SO MUCH WHEN USING FEDERAL STATUTES TO PROSECUTE THESE INDIVIDUALS IS AKIN TO BLOG FOUNDATION WITH DYNAMITE. ONCE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPLODES, IT BECOMES DIFFICULT FOR THE GROUP TO FUNCTION. THE WEIGHT OF THIS KIND OF OPERATION, THE ORGANIZATION CRUMBLES. WE WILL KEEP DOING THIS GREAT WORK AND WILL CONTINUE TO COUNT ON OUR FEDERAL COUNTERPARTS AND INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS TO BE WITH US. NOW I LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO ONE OF OUR ABSOLUTE CLOSEST PARTNERS AND BEST COLLEAGUES FROM THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION, ROBERT PATTISON, ACTING DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR. MR. PATTISON: GOOD MORNING. I AM PLEASED TO REPRESENT THE DEA AND JOIN THE OTHER LITTLE AND COLLEAGUES IN ANNOUNCING THE TAKEDOWN. EXTREMELY DEDICATED INVESTIGATORS, ANALYSTS, AND PROSECUTORS WORK TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE. I GREATLY APPRECIATE THE LARGER COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS OF ALL OF OUR OTHER FEDERAL PARTNERS INCLUDING THE FBI, IRS, UNITED STATES POSTAL INSPECTION SERVICE, AND HOMELAND SECURITY. AS DIRECTOR MCCABE NOTED, THESE CASES DEMAND INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION AND COOPERATION. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE WORK OF OUR FEDERAL, FELLOW LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS IN THAILAND, THE NETHERLANDS, LITHUANIA, CANADA, UNITED KINGDOM, FRANCE, AND OBVIOUSLY EUROPOL. WE ARE ALL SAVVY REMINDED ON A DAILY BASIS, OUR NATION CONTINUES TO FACE AN OPIOID EPIDEMIC. THE DARK WEB IS AN AVAILABLE AND SEEMINGLY ANONYMOUS MARKETPLACE FOR THE SALE OF THESE DRUGS. A DEA CONTINUES TO BE FULLY COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING THIS EPIDEMIC. WE ARE ATTACKING THE PROBLEM FROM MULTIPLE ANGLES. FROM THE TRADITIONAL ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS TARGETING THE MAJOR SOURCES OUTSIDE OF OUR BORDERS THAT FEEL UNTOUCHABLE TO THEIR NETWORKS THAT BRING THE DRUGS ACROSS OUR BORDERS INTO THIS COUNTRY, TO THE VIOLENT STREET GANGS THAT SELL THE DEADLY POISON IN OUR LOCAL NEIGHBORHOODS, AND TO THE CORRUPT DOCTORS IN ROGUE PHARMACIES INVOLVED IN THE DIVERSION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. ALTHOUGH THE BUSINESS MODELS OF THESE GROUPS VARY, THEY ARE SIMILAR WHEN IT COMES TO THE DISTRACTION THEY CAUSE. THEY ALL SHARE ONE ADDITIONAL COMMON CHARACTERISTIC. THEY OPERATE ON BORROWED TIME. THE ALPHA BAY CRIMINAL NETWORK WAS YET ANOTHER CONTRIBUTOR SOURCE FEEDING THIS EPIDEMIC, SUPPLYING COUNTLESS ATTICS THROUGH DIRECT SALES AND SUPPLYING DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO RUN THIS COUNTRY AND OTHERS WITH LARGER QUANTITIES FOR REDISTRIBUTION. ALPHA BAY WAS THE LARGEST DARK MARKET PLATFORM OPERATING ON THE DARK WEB, RESPONSIBLE FOR APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION IN ILLICIT SALES. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION WHICH CAME AS A RESULT OF PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF DRUGS LIKE FENTANYL AND HEROIN. AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BROUGHT UP, MORE THAN 250,000 LISTINGS FOR ILLEGAL DRUGS WERE ON THAT SITE AT THE TIME IT WAS TAKEN DOWN. THE DARK WEB SEEMINGLY ALLOWS FOR ANONYMITY AND CREATES EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGES FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT AS WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED IN THIS CASE, THESE CHALLENGES ARE NOT INSURMOUNTABLE. ALEXANDER LEARNED WHAT SO MANY OTHERS HAVE. HARD WORK AND DETERMINATION BY OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS DEMONSTRATE NO ONE IS UNTOUCHABLE. ELECTIVELY, WE WILL LEVERAGE OUR LEGAL AUTHORITIES AND CAPABILITIES WITH CONTINUED DETERMINATION TO IDENTIFY AND TARGET CRIMINALS WHEREVER THEY MAY HIDE, WHICH INCLUDE CYBERSPACE. WE ARE KEENLY AWARE THERE WILL BE ANOTHER ALPHA BAY. BUT WITH EACH INVESTIGATION WE LEARN MORE AND GET THAT HER. WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE THESE-- THOSE ATTEMPTING TO HIDE BEHIND THE ANONYMITY OF THE DARK WEB. I WANT TO THANK THE DEDICATED MEN AND WOMEN OF THE DEA AND OUR PARTNER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FOR THEIR INCREDIBLE WORK ON THIS PARTICULAR OPERATION. AND TO THE METAL -- MANY FEDERAL PROSECUTORS THAT WORK TIRELESSLY TO BRING THESE CRIMINALS TO JUSTICE TO PROTECT OUR CITIZENS. WITH THAT, I LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE YOUR POLL DIRECTOR -- THE EUROPOL DIRECTOR. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. ON THE FINAL SPEAKER, SO WE WILL HOLD YOUR ATTENTION FOR A FEW MINUTES MORE. THANK YOU TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, COLLEAGUES OF THE DOJ FOR INVITING ME TO BE A PART OF THIS EVENT TODAY. WE ARE PLEASED THAT EUROPOL PLAYED OUR PART IN COORDINATING THE INTERNATIONAL DIMENSIONS OF THIS GROUNDBREAKING OPERATION, ESPECIALLY IN EUROPE. AS YOU HAVE HEARD, THIS OUTSTANDING LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTION HERE IN THE U.S. TO BRING TO AN END ALPHA BAY WAS COORDINATED WITH SIMULTANEOUS ACTION IN EUROPE, AGAINST ANOTHER MAJOR MARKETPLACE. THE SHUTTING DOWN OF THAT, THE DUTCH AUTHORITIES ARE ANNOUNCING RIGHT NOW IN THE NETHERLANDS AT THEIR OWN PRESS CONFERENCE. THESE TWO CASES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TOGETHER AND OUR JOINT HIT ON BOTH OF THESE DARK MARKETS IS ONE OF THE MOST SOPHISTICATED LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS AGAINST CYBERCRIME THAT WE HAVE EVER SEEN. SO THE SCALE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF, YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE FIGURES. ALPHA BAY AND THE MARKET BETWEEN THEM WERE TWO OF THE TOP THREE CRIMINAL MARKETPLACES ON A DARK WEB. TRADING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ILLICIT COMMODITIES, DRUGS, AND MANY OTHERS, THE DETAILS OF WHICH YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT. THAT IS 40,000 VENDORS DEPENDING ON THE MARKETPLACE TO SELL EVERYTHING FROM FENTANYL TO LEGAL FIREARMS AND MALWARE FOR CYBERCRIME ATTACKS. THEY COORDINATE A TAKEDOWN AND HAS PUNCHED A BIG HOLE IN THE OPERATING ABILITY OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND OTHER SERIOUS CRIMINALS AROUND THE WORLD. BUT WHAT MADE THIS OPERATION REALLY SPECIAL WAS THE STRATEGY WE RAN TO MAGNIFY THE DISRUPTIVE IMPACT OF THE JOINT ACTIONS. BETWEEN EUROPOL, FBI, DEA, DUTCH POLICE, THE TEAM PLAY THAT WE RAN HERE WAS TO TAKE OVER CONTROL OF THE HANSA MARKET UNDER DUTCH JUDICIAL AUTHORITY A MONTH AGO, WHICH ALLOWED US TO MONITOR THE ACTIVITIES, CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES OF USERS, WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE, AND THEN SHUT DOWN ALPHA BAY DURING THE SAME PERIOD. WHAT THIS MEANT, IN PARTICULAR, WAS THAT WE COULD IDENTIFY AND DISRUPT THE REGULAR CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT WAS HAPPENING ON HANSA MARKET BUT ALSO SWEEP UP ALL OF THOSE NEW USERS THAT WERE DISPLACED FROM ALPHA BAY AND LOOKING FOR A NEW TRADING PLOT FORM FOR THEIR CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES. IN FACT, THEY FLOCK TO HANSA IN DROVES. WE RECORDED AN EIGHT TIMES INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF HUMAN USERS ON HANSA IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE TAKEDOWN OF ALPHA BAY. SINCE THE UNDERCOVER OPERATION TO TAKE OVER HANSA MARKET BY THE DUTCH POLICE, USERNAMES AND PASSWORDS OF THOUSANDS OF BUYERS AND SELLERS OF ILLICIT COMMODITIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND ARE THE SUBJECT OF FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATIONS BY EUROPOL AND OUR PARTNER AGENCIES. SO AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT STRATEGY, THEREFORE, LEVERAGING THE COMBINED OPERATIONAL AND TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES OF MULTIPLE AGENCIES HERE IN THE U.S. AND AROUND EUROPE HAS BEEN AN EXTRA ORDINARY SUCCESS. AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE COLLECTIVE POWER WE CAN BRING A CONCERTED GLOBAL LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY TO WORK AGAINST EVEN THE MOST CHALLENGING SERIOUS CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES. MY RESPECT AND ADMIRATION GOES TO ALL THOSE INVOLVED HERE IN THE U.S., THE NETHERLANDS, MANY OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS MANY OF MY OWN COLLEAGUES IN EUROPOL. THERE ARE THREE OTHER MAJOR IMPLICATIONS IN ITS OPERATIONS. FIRSTLY, THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE UNDERGROUND CRIMINAL ECONOMY HAS TAKEN A SERIOUS HIT. A MUCH BIGGER EVEN THAN WHAT WE SAW IN 2013 WITH SILK ROAD. SECONDLY, THE INTELLIGENCE WE HAVE YIELDED THROUGH THE MONITORING OF HANSA HAS GIVEN US NEW INSIGHT INTO THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY OF THE DARKNET, INCLUDING MANY OF ITS MANY LEADING FIGURES. WE HAVE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH EUROPOL NEW INTELLIGENCE LEADS CONNECTED TO DARKNET TO ALREADY 37 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. FINALLY, OF COURSE, AS YOU HAVE HEARD, THERE IS A VERY STRONG MESSAGE HERE. TO THOSE WHO ENGAGE IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY ON THE INTERNET AND THE DARKNET ESPECIALLY YOU ARE NOT AS SAFE AND ANONYMOUS AS YOU THINK YOU ARE. THIS OPERATION IS EXAMPLE OF THE IMPROVING CONCERTED ABILITY OF LAW OR SMITH TO STRIKE AGAINST CRIMINALS, EVEN ON THE DARKNET. EUROPOL'S STANDING OF A NEW INTERNATIONAL TEAM TO MONITOR DARKNET MUCH -- MARKET PLACES IN THE FUTURE. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN TODAY FROM THIS COORDINATED HIT AGAINST THESE TWO MARKETPLACES IS JUST A TASTE OF WHAT IS TO COME IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS, THIS IS NOT REALLY A NORMAL DAY. THE PRESIDENT MADE VERY DISPARAGING REMARKS ABOUT YOU, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES, DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL YESTERDAY. GIVEN WHAT HE SAID, WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THOSE REMARKS, HOW SERIOUSLY ARE YOU CONSIDERING POSSIBLY RESIGNING? MR. SESSION: WE IN THIS DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE EVERY SINGLE DAY TO WORK HARD TO SERVE THE NATIONAL INTEREST AND WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY JOIN IN THE PRIORITIES THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP -- HE GAVE US SEVERAL DIRECTIVES. ONE IS TO DISMANTLE INTERNET TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE ANNOUNCING TODAY. DISMANTLING OF THE LARGEST DARK WEBSITE IN THE WORLD BY FAR. I CONGRATULATE OUR PEOPLE FOR THAT. I HAVE THE HONOR OF SERVING AS ATTORNEY GENERAL. IT IS SOMETHING THAT GOES BEYOND ANY THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE EVER HAD FOR MYSELF. WE LOVE THIS JOB. WE LOVE THIS DEPARTMENT. I PLAN TO CONTINUE TO DO SO AS LONG AS THAT IS APPROPRIATE. &gt;&gt; ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS, HOW DO YOU FEEL YOU CAN EFFECTIVELY SERVE FROM HERE ON OUT, IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PRESIDENT? MR. SESSIONS: WE ARE SERVING RIGHT NOW. THE WORK WE ARE DOING TODAY IS THE KIND OF WORK THAT WE INTEND TO CONTINUE. JUST LAST WEEK, WE ANNOUNCED THE LARGEST HEALTH CARE TAKEDOWN EVER IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAD ALL THE MAJOR LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERS IN MY OFFICE YESTERDAY TO TALK ABOUT UNIFIED EFFORTS TO IMPROVE CRIME-FIGHTING WITH STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS. I AM TOTALLY CONFIDENT WE CAN CONTINUE TO RUN THIS OFFICE IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY. BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE FOR YOU TO FOCUS NOW ON THE WORK OF THE INDIVIDUAL BEHIND ME, THAT HAVE HELPED BUT THIS CASE TOGETHER, SO THAT WE CAN CELEBRATE AND AFFIRM THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE DONE, SO THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM IT, AND GET EVEN BETTER IN THE FUTURE. &gt;&gt; DECK THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ROSENSTEIN, THE PRESIDENT TOLD A NEW YORK TIMES, THE FACT THAT YOU ARE FROM BALTIMORE CONCERNS HIM BECAUSE THERE. IS THAT A VALID CONCERN IN YOUR VIEW, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? MR. ROSENSTEIN: WE ARE WORKING EVERY DAY TO ADVANCE THE PRIORITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. PROUD TO BE SURE YESTERDAY, PROUD TO BE HERE TODAY, PROUD TO WORK YOUR TOMORROW. WE ARE SPENDING EVERY MINUTE TO ADVANCE THE INTEREST OF THE DEPARTMENT. AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID, WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS ALPHA BAY CASE, AN IMPORTANT CASE. WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS HERE THAT ASSISTED IN THE INVESTIGATION. THAT IS ALL I WILL TALK ABOUT TODAY. Source: URL"

Police sources identified the individual as Alexander Vinnik, 38. After a tip-off, he was arrested in a small beachside village in northern Greece, on a U.S. warrant, and police said the United States would seek to extradite him. ""Since 2011 the 38-year-old has been running a criminal organization which administers one of the most important websites of electronic crime in the world,"" police said in a statement, describing an alleged money laundering operation that ""legalizes proceeds from illegal activities"". It was thought that 'at least' $4 billion in cash had been laundered through a bitcoin platform since 2011; the platform had 7 million bitcoins deposited, and 5.5 million bitcoins in withdrawals. Bitcoin was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden, making traditional financial regulation difficult if not impossible. The detainee was held on four counts of running an unlicensed money-transfer operation, conspiracy, money laundering in violation of 17 acts in the U.S. criminal code, and transactions in cash acquired through illicit means. The Russian Foreign Ministry in Moscow said it had no information on the case. In a separate prominent cybercrime case, the United States is seeking to extradite another Russian, Peter Levashov, from Spain. U.S. prosecutors have charged him with hacking offences, saying he operated a network of tens of thousands of infected computers used by cyber criminals."

23,cybercrime,DarkNetMarkets,Two Men Associated With the Hansa Darknet Market Busted By the Nrw,33,6ry56g,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/6ry56g/two_men_associated_with_the_hansa_darknet_market/,2017-08-06 22:41:40," Two drug lords are now in the police custody after an investigation led to their arrest in Germany. According to police, They contributed to the rise of dangerous substances, sold on one of the largest, now busted, Darknet markets; Hansa. Their ages are 31 and 32 years, but their identities were withheld by authorities. Some reports say that they were the administrators of the Hansa market. According to the police, the duo played a huge role in the selling of drugs, weapons, and fake documents to people on the Darknet market. The duo was the backbone of the Hansa Darknet market, and their efforts kept the illegal trade alive, as confirmed after Germany and other European countries conducted an investigation over the month. This week has been a busy one after the shutting down of Darknet marketplaces, and the arresting of vendors and users on the various platforms. Information from the WDR reveals that the authorities spotted the 31-year-old suspect and arrested him in Neunkirchen. Most of these Darknet drug lords run their services from the cities, and that is where they traffic drugs to buyers all over the world. Since their arrest, they are reported to be in the custody of the Bavarian police. Two agencies in Germany waged the war against the Darknet. The Central Office and the Prosecution office in Bamberg collaborated to hunt down the suspects. Other ministries and agencies have also shown their support for the fight against Darknet and its dealers. The Bavarian Justice Minister recently called for support in the fight against the Darknet marketplace. Winfried Bausback, the Bavarian Justice Minister has said; investigators must get their feet on the legal ground by receiving information about the sender and recipient of mailings. Tracking addresses on the deliveries have led to the arrest of many Darknet dealers in Germany. Today, controlling the websites are nationwide priority. The Frankfurt investigators said that the arrested duo was pillars behind the smooth running of the Hansa Darknet market, before its recent shut-down by authorities in some selected countries in Europe and America. George Ungefuk, the current Chief Attorney of the Frankfurt Office described the Hansa market as the worlds second largest avenue for trading illicit goods. The suspects have violated the copyright law in Germany. They are therefore guilty of producing and selling counterfeit documents to people on the Darknet market. Reports state that the supposed Hansa market operators have a good personal relationship with each other. They are also technological genius for setting up such a great platform. They have not yet been charged, as an investigation is still ongoing. The police will expectedly complete their investigation in three to four months time. The case will likely be taken over by the Prosecutors office in Cologne because both men come from the North Rhine-Westphalia. Investigators are still making sure that they shut down the remaining illegal black markets online, and arrest its vendors. Silk Road, Alphabay, and Hansa market have all been one-time reigning champions in the online drug trade. However, their operation could not stand the test of time. The Hansa Market Taken Down By Authorities The market which won the trust of many drug vendors became one of the few sites taken down by authorities. The Europol and the US Department of Justice announced in a press release that the site is no more. The suspected German administrators who are in the police custody made so much money from the website, especially after they closed down the Alphabay market. Authorities from different countries collaborated to act on the global operation. The Drug Enforcement Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, together with the law enforcement authorities in Thailand, United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Lithuania, and the Canada conducted the operation. The Europol was also a participant in the operation. Andrew McCabe, the FBI deputy director said that some people thought it was impossible for Darknet market administrators and users to be identified and arrested due to the many nationalities involved. He said; There are some criminals that think of cybercrime as a freebie. He continued that They think they will get away with it because there are too many players and too many countries, they think they will get away with it because the schemes are too complex and because they run in the shadows. This shows that arresting Darknet dealers are possible, and authorities are going through files to find and arrest the buyers and sellers who traded on the platform. Source: URL URL "

The event was hosted by Europol at its headquarters in The Hague and was co-chaired by representatives from the agencys EC3 and Analysis Project (AP) SUSTRANS. &gt;The main aim of the conference was to further strengthen the fight against the abuse of virtual currencies for criminal transactions and money laundering. Another interesting topic covered was the legitimate use of bitcoin technology, including the use of cryptocurrencies as a store of value, a payment method for legitimate goods and services. The event brought together over 150 experts from many regions of the world. Most participants represented law enforcement authorities from European countries. Additionally, a number of LEAs from non-EU countries participated as well. &gt;Furthermore, the event was supported by experts from the private sector specialised in facilitating the lawful use of virtual currencies by providing online exchange, payment processing or wallet services including **Bitcoin.de, Bitfinex, BitPanda, Bitonic, Bitstamp, BitPay, Coinbase, Cubits, LocalBitcoins, SpectroCoin and Xapo**. &gt;The participants shared their insights into criminal trends and the latest techniques used by criminals to hide their financial tracks and cash out criminal proceeds using bitcoins and other virtual currencies. &gt;The latest technology solutions for tracing blockchain transactions for criminal investigations were presented by both law enforcement developers and tracking companies that take advantage of the inherent transparency of bitcoin transactions. Also highlighted was use of blockchain technology as an independent tamper-proof decentralised ledger. This opens a wide variety of practical use cases including for extracting forensic evidence. &gt;Best practices and law enforcement techniques were shared through concrete case examples such as investigations on ransomware and DDoS extortion. The event also offered opportunities for closer cooperation and new partnerships to prevent and fight cybercrime and money laundering, as well as facilitate asset recovery. &gt;Virtual currency experts demonstrated their best practices in implementing Know Your Customer (KYC) policies and mechanisms, as well as risk-based approaches to suspicious transactions. &gt;Over the last few years, the annual VCC has stimulated the development of an expert community of investigators, prosecutors and experts from the private sector, who jointly contribute to fighting and preventing the abuse of virtual currencies for criminal activities. The participants have expressed their commitment to further foster this valuable cooperation in the future. &gt;Note to editors &gt;Europol set up EC3 in 2013 to strengthen the law enforcement response to cybercrime in the EU and thus to help protect European citizens, businesses and governments from online crime. Cybercrime costs EU Member States EUR 265 billion a year, almost one third of the global figure. Cybercrime is actually a wide and varied problem. And EC3 is a key part of Europols, and the EUs, response. EC3 takes a three-pronged approach to the fight against cybercrime: forensics, strategy and operations. &gt;Europols AP SUSTRANS was opened in 2001 and is currently one of the oldest and widest APs at Europol. It provides support to EU Member States cross-border investigations into the money laundering activities of transnational criminal organisations. This has been done through the establishment of a pan-European platform destined to integrate, process and analyse all types of dedicated financial data (ongoing investigations, suspicious transaction reports, cash seizures, international transfers, etc.). All 28 EU Member States and 52 Europol third partners are part of this project. source URL notice the exchanges, payment services and wallet providers marked in bold who apparently are pretty eager to combat illegitimate uses of their services."

And Follow Up After The Owner ""Thought"" He Was In The Clear I Guess It Did Make A Little Difference What I Did with BBMC( who was known as /sheeproadreloaded2) At That Time.",9,5v3qef,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/5v3qef/uncle_scam_czech_owner_of_sheep_marketplace/,2017-02-20 20:51:34,"*URL &gt; Who benefited from one of the largest bitcoin heists in history? Benefit is an interesting word  simply because a benefit doesnt necessarily mean a payoff in the form of currency. Perhaps, the payoff can come in the form of a successful operation, a mission accomplished. Let us go on an adventure into an intriguing theory, based off what recent reports have already told us, and curious information from a source, known as Gwern Branwen. Whats Happened So Far? Now up to $100 million in stolen BTC, this heist certainly rattled the entire Tor network drug trade. On Nov 21, the Sheep Marketplace administrators were sticking with the story that a vendor named EBOOK101 absconded with 5,400 bitcoins. However, SMP users werent quite convinced, due to suspicious occurrences that had already been taking place. According to Net-Security.org, But there are many that dont believe the explanation, and suspect the operators of Sheep Marketplace of having executed a clever scam. In the week leading to the theft, they began blocking users from withdrawing their Bitcoins. Due to the belief that the entire setup may have been a scam, SMP users begin to flock towards an online competitor, Black Market Reloaded. Knowing that this flood of new users would compromise stability and security, BMR decides to close its doors. According to RT.com, The administrator of the site, known as Backopy, said in a forum post the site would not be able to guarantee anonymity to its customers with the influx of new users since Tor  software that hides the identity of the sites users and owners  is not designed to handle a large user base. SR is down, The Black Flag ended up as a scam, Atlantis ended up as a scam and now The Sheep Market follows that dark path. This puts BMR at the edge of the blade. Tor cant support any site to be too big, Backopy wrote. Essentially, Backopy has decided to close BMR doors in order to preserve the anonymity of its users. The Tor network hides anonymity through the difficulty of tracking a single user in a sea of other Tor users. However, when that network is channeled, it is much easier for these users to be tracked. In addition, Tormarket, the site to which the suspected-scammer SMP has linked, is not happy about the publicity: Sheep Marketplace is not directing to another site called Tormarket, but the attention isnt wanted. First of all, we are not associated with the sheep team, wrote Tormarket. The sheep admin is linking us on their frontpage. This is the worst PR we can get right now. Please admin remove the link. Please. And most important thing: delete all data and backups to keep the users safe. At this point, Tormarket has now become invite only, attempting to hold back the flow from Sheep Marketplace. Thus, Pandora is the natural next place that the SMP traffic will flow, as there are already several sources pointing in their direction. Essentially, all of this traffic is bouncing from site to another in a massive exodus from SMP, then being forced in almost predictable directions from BMR to Tormarket to Pandora. From what we know of the NSAs methods of end-to-end correlation, it certainly would make sense that SMPs demise has provided law enforcement with volumes of information about the Tor networks illicit drug trade traffic. Backopy of BMR even warned about such movements in traffic, deciding to close down the site as a result. This movement of traffic must have been predictable from the start. Czech, Please Only 1 month ago, a Reddit post from Theduded23 complained that Sheep Marketplace security was extremely flawed, saying that it took very little time to track down where the site was based and what company ran the server: Oh, we found sheepmarketplace.coms real ip at the first attempt. Not bad.. Lets check IP details whois 185.2.42.79 Result: URL Well, as you see sheepmarketplace.com hosted in Czech Republic on HexaGeeks servers Guess what it means sheepmarketplace.coms owner same as sheep5u64fi457aw.onion He is living in Czech Republic He sucks at security Perhaps it was this relaxed stance on security that landed Tomas Jiikovsk, the suspected scammer, in a difficult situation. Attempting to move the stolen bitcoins like the wind through the blockchain, it appears as if he was running from a disgruntled SMP user called TheNodManOut: **qoutes below are not mine like he puts on his site, but it is /sheeproadreloaded/BBMC** Ive been a very busy boy. All day, weve been chasing the scoundrel with our stolen bitcoins through the blockchain. Around lunchtime (UK), I was chasing him across the roof of a moving train, (metaphorically). I was less than 20 minutes, or 2 blockchain confirmations, behind Tomas, he wrote on 2 December Reddit post that refers to the individual accused of the scam. Ive just chased a thief through a washing machine for you. ""I chased him through the washer to find out TheNodManOut had already sussed the main wallet first, I imagine he drives around in a van solving mysteries all the time"" This is where the story becomes interesting They Call Him Gwern A researcher named, Gwern Branwen, posted a bet, heralding the end of both SMP and BMR. He noticed that Sheep Marketplace had a mirror site on the clearnet, meaning that it would show up on Google. A clearnet site is, by nature, very easy to trace by law enforcement. In addition, the similarities between the real darknet site and the clearnet site were eerie, as operation from servers in the Czech Republic seemed to be a recurring theme. DJ Pangburn of Motherboard.vice.com reports, Even before the mysterious leakers help, Branwen smelled something fishy with the goings-on at Sheep Marketplace. The veriest Google search [of Sheep Marketplace] would turn up that clearnet site, wrote Branwen in his Reddit post The Bet: BMR and Sheep to die in a year. And ithas been pointed out that the clearnet Czech site hosted by HexaGeek was uncannily similar to the actual hidden service. This bet was posted roughly one month before the SMP scam took place; however, mere days afterwards, Branwen was contacted by an anonymous security hobbyist, who told him that SMP was started and run by none other than a Czech individual named Tomas Jiikovsk, according to Pangburn. The anonymous source said that he was able to track down Jiikovsk, and began to divulge damning information about the wayward scammer to Branwen. The information was very convincing that Jiikovsk is the one who runs SMP. Pangburn writes, The documents note, among other things, that Jiikovsk owns the Sheep Marketplace VPS hosting service, and controlled several other domains on that service, Old Cans and Font Park being two of them; that he was the earliest Sheep Marketplace promoter, advertising it on other sites earlier this year; that he is a Czech developer who runs Ubuntu, just like the Sheep Marketplace developer; and that his email address is listed on the Bitcoin Scammer List. The tale becomes even muddier when Branwen finds out that this anonymous security hobbyist had already contacted the FBI, concerning his findings (in addition to leaking information about BMR and even Project Black Flag in the past). This means that the FBI already knew the location of Sheep Marketplace servers, in addition to the real world identity of its creator and did nothing? Could it be that the FBI wasnt exactly surprised by this information? An FBI Operation From the Start? According to the Pangburn article, this anonymous security hobbyist leaked information to the FBI on Nov 2, which means that law enforcement would have had plenty of time to track down Jiikovsk. However, the Czech was able to get away with millions in bitcoins after 18 days of no law enforcement interference? Why didnt they move in? Perhaps, the FBI either allowed the scam to happen, or outright orchestrated the scam by gaining leverage through Jiikovsks wayward past. One website even goes as far as to suggest that this Czech scammer was working with the authorities, and was able to work out some kind of a deal. Curiously, this website is written in Czech. Be warned, the translation is a little rough: FBI reportedly had received information from the same informant, who spoke with Branwen. Thus, if the programmer Thomas J. indeed for the operation of Sheep Marketplace centuries, perhaps a deal with investigators in some form of cooperation, Vice speculates. Again, we must ask, who benefitted most from the demise of Sheep Marketplace and the subsequent scamming of its users out of $100 million in BTC? The result of this most recent scam removed one marketplace (SMP), shut down another (BMR), and directed the traffic to two obvious others (Tormarket then Pandora). Concerning the scammer himself, Ross Ulbricht of Silk Road was caught from only a few mere slips in security, but Jiikovsk was not caught yet had massive security flaws, in addition to a mirror site running on the same servers from the Czech Republic? In addition, what was the true purpose of the mirrored clearnet SMP site? Could it have provided law enforcement with an opportunity to launch man-in-the-middle attacks against Sheep Marketplace users? We already know that the NSA is utilizing these tactics, especially against the Tor network, according to Bruce Schneier. Could these attacks have infected user computers, and now authorities are extracting mountains of data about darknet drug trade traffic by stirring the anthill? One argument against this theory could be that the FBI would never use such tactics, as it enables crime to persist on a grand scale. Law enforcement itself would be responsible for untold numbers of illicit drug transactions. However, this would not be the first time that the FBI has allowed large amounts of cybercrime to persist for the purpose of catching the big fish. On Friday, Nov 15 2013, a hacker named, Jeremy Hammond was sentenced to 10 years in prison. How did he get caught? He was enabled by the FBI, and setup for the sting, said the convict: In August, Hammond released a statement suggesting that while Sabu aided the FBI, the bureau also used him to encourage other group members to hack various websites at the agencys choosing, including those of foreign governments. What the United States could not accomplish legally, it used Sabu, and by extension, me and my co-defendants, to accomplish illegally, Hammond wrote. Why was the United States using us to infiltrate the private networks of foreign governments? What are they doing with the information we stole? And will anyone in our government ever be held accountable for these crimes? If the FBI simply used SMP to track users in the darknet drug trade, allowing it to continue until the time was right, it is certainly not outside the realm of possibility. With all we have found out about US government tactics in 2013 alone, no tactic seems out-of-bounds any longer. They ended catching Tomas later on in money laundering, by depositing hundreds of thousands of dollars bought with bitcoin to his Wife(Girlfriends?) bank account which later purchasing a house in his grandfathers name worth few hundred thousand. **The Follow Up To The Story** *What Happened To Tomas* &gt;Sheep Marketplace was one of the online markets that gained popularity after the fall of Silk Road 1.0. The sites alleged owner, Tom Jiikovsk, was arrested in March 2015 and little information has been released since his arrest, until now. &gt;Jan Danek, head of the South Moravian polices economic division, spoke with a local news outlet on the investigation and arrest of the Sheep Marketplace owner. Not only was Jiikovsk arrested for enabling a drug trade, but Moravian police are charging him also with the theft of millions of bitcoins, stolen from the sites users. &gt;Although two Florida men were arrested for stealing 5,400 bitcoins from the Sheep Marketplace between 2013-2014, the number of bitcoins stolen by Jiikovsk is far greater. At the time, the amount stolen was reported to be worth around $40 million. &gt;In the Florida case, law enforcement was able to trace the stolen bitcoins through services like Blockchain.info. Danek explains that following the Sheep Marketplace shut down, officers were able to trace suspicious transactions to bank accounts in a similar manner. &gt;South Moravian police became aware of the Sheep Marketplace once the site disappeared, causing a major disturbance on the internet. Millions of dollars in bitcoins were stolen from users resulting in law enforcement being notified of a South Moravian man who was receiving suspicious transactions, while also fitting the profile of the sites owner. &gt;Danek claims this man magically got rich. The exit-scam is unanimously known as the biggest darknet scam ever. &gt;Law enforcement started tracing money that was deposited into the bank account of Eva Bartoov, Jiikovsks wife. $38,000 had been deposited from abroad, connecting her to the case for the very least, with money laundering charges. From there, more money was traced to Jiikovsks realtor where police discovered he purchased a house under his grandfathers name for around $300,000. &gt;Further investigation proved that Jiikovsk was the owner of the Sheep Marketplace. He had purchased a new home, news cars, luxury furniture, as well as expensive computers. Danek says that during their 9-month investigation, Jiikovsks new purchases totaled more than $800,000. Everything has since been seized, including the house and cars. &gt;All of the money was laundered from foreign accounts. The bitcoins were exchanged overseas before deposited into both his account and his wifes account via Air Bank. &gt;Jiikovsk is in police custody and faces up to 12 years in prison for the theft of bitcoins and enabling a drug trade. His wife is charged with aiding him in laundering the money, but she is currently not being detained by police. &gt;A spokesperson from the South Moravian prosecutors office, Hynek Olma, says that Bartoov, if convicted, could face eight years in prison. **Wasn't disgruntled so don't why know he put that, I was more ""bored"" since I never used sheep personally. lol! I remember a lot of users always said it wouldn't ever matter would never amount to him getting in trouble or caught. As my purpose wasn't really for him to get caught or hurt. It was merely trying to prevent him to cash out easy. Especially with /sheeproadreloaded2 kept tagging wallets with .0666 btc on multiple wallets, while others was leaving msg's like these coins are from sheep market heist.**"

The two most common arguments raised over the years were: 1) That DPR should have made the use of PGP mandatory for doing business on Silk Road. He was told, again, and again, and again, that should the server ever be located, that this would be the only protection the users would have. He didn't listen, and when the server was seized, the Feds got their mitts on the data for an enormous number of people. (This was our worst nightmare come true.) 2) It was also stated by many people, that everyone needed to use PGP, for the reason(s) listed above. One of the most common arguments I heard in response was that it really wasn't necessary, as the police wouldn't go after small buyers. Well, now the other shoe has dropped. The German police are going after small buyers, and anyone who failed to use PGP to protect themselves may find themselves in a similar situation as the subject of this article. I hate to say ""I told you so!"" but I fucking told you so! Zaphod German Cops Bust Dude Who Bought Weed on Silk Road Years Ago Written by JOSEPH COX CONTRIBUTOR May 27, 2016 // 10:40 AM EST URL Weve seen plenty of high profile and often technical busts on dark web sites targeting dealers, users, and administrators. In a recent case, German cops tracked down a marketplace user who placed orders for just a few grams of cannabis at a time, three years ago. A German user of the original Silk Road and another dark web market was recently fined over 3,000 for ordering cannabis 17 times, according to independent researcher Gwern Branwen. Branwen said in a Reddit post that the buyer contacted him recently. He also uploaded an apparent March 2016 letter from German law authorities detailing the transactions. (Names and other information have been redacted from the letter, so Motherboard was unable to contact its supposed recipient). According to the letter, the customer's 17 purchases varied from 1.5 and 7.4 gram quantities of cannabis, between January and October 2013. Plenty of dark web customers have been punished before. Law enforcement often track down buyers of poisons or weapons and have also gone after buyers of harder drugs, such as MDMA or methamphetamine.There have been a handful of marijuana cases. What makes this case stand out further is that police were still keen on tracking the buyer down years later; Silk Road was shut down way back in September 2013. It appears the customerwho told Branwen he always encrypted his address when providing it to vendorswas identified after German authorities busted a cannabis seller who had kept records of all of their customers. From there, Branwen thinks the police may have gone through records of the Silk Road server to find more of the customers purchases, since he consistently used one username. It's not clear how the authorities would have discovered one of the customer's orders from Outlaw Market, which is still running. The letter adds that communications from Silk Road were used. Can a buyer, in the absence of any intercepted packages or possession of illegal drugs, be prosecuted or otherwise get into trouble? Branwen writes on Reddit. At least in Germany, the answer seems to be yes. This case goes to show that even people who briefly used dark web markets may have to worry about law enforcement eventually tracking them down.

36,cybercrime,DarkNetMarkets,New information to how the German police busted Shiny Flakes.,95,3h2z7e,http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/3h2z7e/new_information_to_how_the_german_police_busted/,2015-08-15 19:50:48,"URL Some new information how the German police found Shiny Flakes. I ran it through translate and tried to improve the important bits. He will be on trial for selling **914 kg** of drugs. &gt;On August 24, begins in Leipzig, the trial of Maximilian S., the alleged operator of the previous online drug marketplace Shiny Flakes. While the investigators are now trying to get rid of 1,197 Bitcoins drug money from his ten wallets in an emergency sale, his lawyer Stefan Costabel will by then many moving boxes have rolled with investigation files, to prepare his defense, perhaps the most difficult. &gt;The burden of proof against the 20-year-olds is overwhelming. The prosecution accuses him of having acted in a period of 14 months with at least **914 kg drugs**. Maximilian should not only have pretty much sold all illegal substances except heroin, but have dealt with a battery of prescription drugs. These were the officials in February this year in addition to huge amounts of MDMA, speed, cocaine, LSD, hashish, 49,000 Euro cash and precision scales and vacuum devices in the room of Leipzig apartment that he was with his mother and stepfather lived-it one of the largest drug discoveries in the history of the Federal Republic. &gt;Observers of the case have wondered how LKA and police were able to shut down the widely networked drug empire so quickly. Our research in recent months show that the investigators have not found Maximilian by specialized cybercrime expertise, but classic detective work and some luck. How exactly expired access, we can, thanks to information held by Motherboard, now traced exclusively. &gt;Two errors Maximilian proved fatal: Firstly, insufficient franking of his broadcasts, which brought the investigators on the trail to Leipzig, on the other hand laziness: **Maximilian always used the same packing station, which was located not far from his home**. At the packing station 145-that was-was under video surveillance he take a taxi which he ordered with a cell phone, which he used exclusively for these trips. More than a dozen mobile phones and two dozen SIM cards were seized in his room-an incredible organizational effort, which steadily increase with the extent of the business volume. Must have the pressure under which the dealer stood, one can imagine only with difficulty. &gt;Furthermore it was not smart to make the deliveries at routine appointment. A courier driver from the Netherlands came regularly every Thursday to the supply of drugs for Maximilian the investigators knew now through their observation of the packing station and the doorway. On February 24, 2015, the officials let Maximilian and his couriers handover of 25,000 ecstasy tablets, 20 kilograms of hashish, 10,000 LSD trips and 27 kg amphetamine initially settle at rest, before arresting the courier a few corners in a parking lot while Maximilian the heavy cartons contributed to his room. &gt;The officials had tremendous luck: Besides a delivery list all important logins are right at hand in a pragmatic titled text file. &gt;After the alleged Bulgarian Zhivko Z. courier had been arrested (even against him begins the trial in Leipzig on 24 August.), a whole hour passed before the police accessed in Maximilians rooms, to which a special task force gave forcibly entered. At this point, the officials had tremendous luck; because Maximilian was not nearly as restrictive with its data, as he liked to think about and had also indicated in the motherboard Interview: &gt;**Not only were the officials on his computer a neatly guided delivery list, complete with status notices to individual orders since December 2013 but also a document on the all important logins were given to operate the platforms.** It has quite a stroke of luck for officials have been, who did not know even a month earlier, against whom they e they determine actually, and now suddenly standing in the room of a 20-year old which was filled to the ceiling with drugs and the most important Access data was found in a pragmatic titled text file. &gt;**From Cloudflare on the server at a Dutch company everything was thus actually been served on a silver platter, which made it possible for the the police for further investigation and for convenient switching off the sales platform.** Shortly thereafter, emblazoned on the shiny flakes site has a banner ad for the diverse training opportunities at the Saxon police. &gt;There is no question that Maximilian carefully and thoughtfully going through a great period of time and provided protection in many ways. He used two dozen SIM card, various mobile phones for separate contacts being established with suppliers as well as tools with which he could himself create magnetic cards to collect the goods using chopped mail accounts through a packing station and ship. Maximilian S. was a busy young man who planned prudently and was comprehensively equipped for the global trade in narcotics. In particular, he seems to have protected his door-because to date claimed the accused that mother and stepfather would not notice its profitable start-up because he had holed up literally for his business in his room. &gt;Before his retirement from the outside world Maximilian had an entirely different occupation with customer contact: After his high-school diploma in Leipzig 2011 he began an apprenticeship as a restaurant manager at an Italian restaurant, where he was a diligent, if you want be noticed stiff and neat. When he broke the formation in 2013, the disappointing his boss. What then, however, it brought him to the rather startling career change, however, is still unclear. It is clear that Maximilian shut increasingly, be filed for as a small business web design and made at the same time in the Darknet and Clearnet to the clandestine channels of distribution of an ever-growing drug business. &gt;The perceived anonymity of online trading has changed the the successful trader profile: It is no longer necessarily the violent, terrifying Strippenzieher but-as the example of Ross Ulbricht shows-if in doubt just sometimes a solitary New Kid On The Block, who prefers sitting at home than on the road to act, has little contact with the outside world and has its strengths in the strategy in dealing with computers, cryptography and logistics. &gt;Of course, secrecy supreme Good at all physical and digital traces that need to blur it in the online drug trafficking. Therein lay Maximilian Forte: He knew that the police would be neither able to read his PGP-encrypted e-mails, even to pursue his Bitcoin cash flows. He also knew how he was able to hire smart enough using the Tor network in digital distribution without unmask itself. The addresses of its store sites were registered in Tonga and the Cocos Islands, the servers were in the Netherlands. He operated in the Darknet and Clearnet, campaigned openly with his offer and felt safe. As sure as someone feels that offers, while its customers and regularly insulted a big collection of illegal substances worldwide. **Online could the police not harm him, until they were in his room, the warehouse and headquarters was simultaneously.** &gt;The more likely it is now the question of why the police have been waiting for so long to the driver's arrest with the access to the apartment. Had Maximilian had a consultation at this time and the courier does not reach by phone, he would have been alerted and possibly could destroy evidence. &gt;Even otherwise the officials proved partly not too great tactical skill in the investigation: For example, a first totally uninvolved other tenants of the apartment building was under surveillance and suspected of being the operator of drug shipping Shiny Flakes, although it was the police succeeded in Gohlis, shortly before the end of January to take a picture of Maximilian to ""his"" packing station and trace it back to his house. A simple comparison with the personal data and passport photographs stored at the registration office had dispelled the suspicion. However, the Leipziger investigators consulted instead the property manager and watched for a bit longer than a week a completely uninvolved. &gt;Whether the former drug kingpin who is sitting in custody for six months, can now be sentenced even to juvenile justice, is very questionable: In his room there were so many drugs that the term ""minor amount"" by more than exceeds 15,000 times. If adult criminal law to be applied, he faces up to 15 years in prison. &gt;From the progress of the process, we will continue to report."

URL As many of you are aware, he is a lone survivor of Op Onymous, which, among other things, went after his tor hidden service ""DOXBIN."" I apologize in advance, it is quite lengthy. ""So, you want to be a darknet drug lord... by nachash nachash@observers.net [The advice in this article can be adapted to suit the needs of other hidden services, including ones which are legal in your jurisdiction. The threat model in mind is that of a drug market. The tone is that of a grandfather who is always annoyingly right, who can't help but give a stream-of-consciousness schooling to some whippersnapper about the way the world works. If this article inspires you to go on a crime spree and you get caught, don't come crying to me about it.] You've decided that you're bored with your cookie-cutter life of working at a no-name startup, getting paid in stock options and empty promises. You want a taste of the good life. Good for you, kid. I used to run a fairly popular hidden service (DOXBIN) that was seized by the FBI after 3 1/2 years of spreading continuous butthurt, then subsequently repossessed from the feds. Because I managed to not get raided, I'm one of the few qualified to instruct others on hidden services and security, simply because I have more real-world experience operating hidden services than the average tor user. In other words, very little of this advice is of the armchair variety, as you'll often find in abundance the Internet. But enough about me. Let's talk about your future as an internet drug lord. 1. Legal/Political First things first, you need to cover the legal, historical and political angles. Read up on various drug kingpins and cartels from the 20th century. Learn everything you can about how they rose and fell ( you can safety ignore all the parts about intelligence agencies backing one drug cartel over another, because that's not going to happen to you). Once you've got a good command of that, read everything you can about busted drug market operators and branch out into cybercrime investigations as well. It wouldn't hurt to make yourself familiar with law enforcement and intelligence agency tactics either. You'll find that virtually all drug kingpins either get murdered or go to prison. Let those lessons sink in, then find a good drug lawyer and make plans for being able to pay them when The Man seizes everything you own. While you're dreaming big about making fat stacks of fake internet money, do some research on Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties and extradition treaties. Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs) are self-explanatory. Country A will help Country B do whatever it takes to aid a cybercrime investigation should some aspect of the crime bleed over into Country A. Figure out which countries don't provide legal assistance to your country in these cases, then find hosting services that are based there. You'll shorten this list by determining which hosts allow tor, or at least don't explicitly forbid it in their Terms of Service (you don't care about exit bandwidth. You just want relays. Remember this for later in the article). Last but not least, sort out which hosts accept payment options that don't make you sweat bullets over the fact that the NSA has been monitoring global financial transactions since at least the 1970s. You will want to avoid any host that advertises itself as bulletproof -- they'll probably kit your box and siphon everything of value, in addition to overcharging you for the privilege of running on older hardware -- and any host which sells a cheap VPS and promises to guarantee your privacy. Extradition treaties mean that if you're in Country A and do something that makes Country B want to prosecute you, Country A is most likely going to give you a one way ticket to Country B. If or when your box gets seized and you know the heat is on, you're going to want to beat it to a place that won't send you back, where you will presumably live out the rest of your days. Just make sure you've made enough money to grease all the right palms in your new life, or the road ahead may be extremely bumpy. If you're smart, you'll permanently move to this country well before you have any trouble with law enforcement. One last thing before moving on: Don't be so stupid as to attempt to hire a hitman to kill anyone. Murder-related charges have no statute of limitations, which means you won't get to write a tell-all book about what a sly bastard you are when this wild ride is a distant memory. If you've reached a point in your new career where murdering people makes sense, it's time to walk away. Don't get corrupted like Dread Pirate Roberts. 2. Technical This section tries to be as operating system independent as possible. You'll want to consult the documentation of your OS for specifics. The technical side of running a hidden service and not getting owned by cops is a lot harder than just installing stuff and crossing your fingers. The recommendations in this section WILL NOT protect you from 0days in the wild, but should help somewhat with damage control. Remember, if they want to own your hidden service, it will probably happen eventually. Before you even think about installing bitwasp and tor, you need to really understand how tor works. Go to freehaven.net and read the white papers until your eyes glaze over, then continue reading until you're out of papers to read. Pay particular attention to the hidden service papers. If you feel like you didn't understand something, come back to that paper again when you have more knowledge. A lot of the papers explain some of the same concepts with slight differences in the intros. Don't skim over them, because you might read someone's rewording that will clarify an idea for you. Check back with freehaven regularly. Once you're up to speed, a good next step is to keep up with the tor project's mailing lists. [1] While you're doing all of this reading, it's (mostly) safe to go ahead and install tor on a box on your local network, purely for experimentation. Keep in mind that the NSA will start scooping up all of your packets simply because you visited torproject.org. That means don't post code questions related your drug market on Stack Exchange, if you want to avoid giving The Man morsels he can use for parallel construction. Once you've gotten hidden services working for http and ssh, you're going to take the first baby step towards evading casual discovery: Bind your hidden services to localhost and restart them. The next step in your journey towards changing the drug business forever is to grab the transparent proxying firewall rules for your operating system to make sure they work. [2] They will guard against attacks that cause your box to send packets to a box the attacker controls, which is useful in thwarting attempts to get the box IP. You may wish to have a setup similar to an anonymous middle box, preferably without public IPs where possible, so if your application gets rooted tor isn't affected. Speaking of applications, do everything you can to ensure that the application code you use to power your hidden service isn't made of Swiss cheese and used bandaids. To protect against other types of attacks, you will want to identify any pre-compiled software that your users will touch and compile it yourself with hardening-wrapper or it's equivalent, plus any custom flags you want to use. If you keep vulnerabilities from the application and server to a minimum, your biggest worries will be tor-related. You will only connect to your production box via a hidden service. It's a good idea to get into that habit early. The only time deviating from this pattern is acceptable is when you have to upgrade tor, at which time you'll want to have a script ready that drops your firewall rules and unbinds ssh from localhost just long enough for you to login, do the upgrade, re-apply the firewall rules and bind ssh to localhost again. If you're not ready to deal with the latency, you're not ready to do any of this. Don't forget to transparently proxy the machine you use too, so you don't slip up by mistake. On the subject of the machine, you need to automate the process of both setting up your hidden service and of destroying it. Proactively change servers every few months, in order to frustrate law enforcement attempts to locate and seize your site. Your creation script should install everything your site needs as well as all configuration files. Your clean-up script needs to destroy all evidence, preferably with a tool like srm. Regarding time-related issues: Always select either UTC or a time zone that doesn't match the box's location. You will also do this to the box you use to interact with your hidden service every day. If you read the whitepapers, you will probably note a recurring theme of clock skew-related attacks, mostly directed at clients, in some of the older papers. Tor won't even start if the clock skew is off by too much. If you want to have some fun at the expense of business in the short term, intentionally take your service offline periodically in order to mess up attempts to match your downtime with public information. If you're the kind of person with access to botnets, you could DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) some provider at the same time on the off chance that someone might connect the dots. This counter-measure will only work on researchers looking at public info, not nation state actors with an ax to grind. I've saved some of the hardest stuff for the last part of this section. It's hard because you have to make choices and it's unclear which of those choices are the best. It's a bit like a Choose Your Own Adventure book. In that spirit, all I can do is lay out the possibilities in as much of a Herodotus-like way as possible. One thing you have to consider is whether you want to run your hidden service as a relay or not. If it's a relay, you'll have extra cover traffic from other innocent tor users. But if your relay goes down at the same time as your hidden service, it will be far more likely to be noticed. Federal criminal complaints make a big deal of seized hidden services not being relays, but three relays were taken down at around the same time as Operation Onymous, so that's not a guaranteed defense. The choice is yours. Remember when I said to take note of hosts that don't ban tor outright? This is the part where you give back to the community in the form of tor relays or bridges. [3] The feel-good aspects of this move are along the same lines as drug barons who build schools and hospitals, but this is more immediately self-serving. You're going buy several servers to set up strictly as relays or bridges, then configure your hidden service box to use only those relays or bridges to enter the tor network. Here's where things start to get theoretical. If an adversary is running a guard node discovery attack -- in which an attacker is able to determine the node you're using to enter the tor network -- against your service and you're using your own relays as entry nodes, the damage they can do will be limited to DoS (Denial of Service) if your relays are not linkable to your identity. However, if you're entering the tor network with bridge nodes, an attacker will probably say ""WTF?"" at first unless they determine they've found a bridge node. Bridge nodes don't use nearly as much bandwidth as relays because there is not a public list of them, so an intelligence agency would have less traffic to sift through, which makes correlation easier. On the other hand, using bridge nodes also allows you to run obfsproxy [4] on both the bridges and your hidden service. obfsproxy allows you to make tor traffic appear to be another type of traffic, which is a good defense against non-Five Eyes entities. For example, your hosting provider may decide to monitor for tor traffic for their own reasons. Just make sure your relays/bridges aren't linkable to you or to each other. One last thing about guard node discovery attacks: The Naval Research Lab published a paper in July 2014 about the ""Sniper Attack,"" [5] which in short works like this: The attacker discovers your guard nodes, then uses an amplified DoS trick to exhaust the memory on all of your nodes. The attacker keeps doing this until your hidden service uses guard nodes that they control. Then it's game over. If your hidden service's entry nodes are all specified in your torrc file and they get DoSed, your service will go offline. In this situation, if all of your relays are down, you essentially have an early warning canary that you're being targeted. In other words: This is the best possible time to book your one-way ticket to your chosen non-extradition country. For those of you with a background in writing exploits, this is similar in principle to how stack smashing protection will render some exploits either unable to function or will turn them into a DoS. Personally, I recommend an ever-changing list of relays or bridges. Add a few new ones at a pre-determined interval, and gradually let old ones go unpaid. 3. Operational Security This section is critical, especially when things start to break down. If everything else goes bad, following this section closely or not could be the difference between freedom and imprisonment. This is important enough to re-state: Transparently proxy your tor computer. This is a good first line of defense, but it is far from the only way to protect yourself. Do not contaminate your regular identity with your Onion Land identity. You're an aspiring drug kingpin. Go out and pay cash for another computer. It doesn't have to be the best or most expensive, but it needs to be able to run Linux. For additional safety, don't lord over your new onion empire from your mother's basement, or any location normally associated with you. Leave your phone behind when you head out to manage your enterprise so you aren't tracked by cell towers. Last but not least for this paragraph, don't talk about the same subjects across identities and take counter-measures to alter your writing style. Don't log any communications, ever. If you get busted and have logs of conversations, the feds will use them to bust other people. Logs are for undercover cops and informants, and have no legitimate use for someone in your position. Keep it in your head or don't keep it at all. At some point, your enterprise is going to have to take on employees. Pulling a DPR move and demanding to see ID from high-volume sellers and employees will just make most people think you're a fed, which will leave your potential hiring pool full of dumbasses who haven't even tried to think any of this out. It will also make it easier for the feds to arrest your employees after they get done arresting you. If your enterprise is criminal in nature -- whether you're selling illegal goods and services or you're in a repressive country that likes to re-educate and/or kill dissidents -- an excellent way of flushing out cops is to force them to get their hands not just dirty, but filthy, as quickly as possible. Don't give them time to get authorization to commit a crime spree. If there's a significant amount of time between when they're given crimes to commit and the commission of those crimes, you need to assume you've got an undercover cop on your hands and disengage. If they commit the crime(s) more or less instantly, you should be fine unless you've got the next Master Splynter on your trail. [6] Disinformation is critical to your continued freedom. Give barium meat tests to your contacts liberally. [7] It doesn't matter if they realize they're being tested. Make sure that if you're caught making small talk, you inject false details about yourself and your life. You don't want to be like Ernest Lehmitz, a German spy during World War II who sent otherwise boring letters about himself containing hidden writing about ship movements. He got caught because the non-secret portion of his letters gave up various minor personal details the FBI correlated and used to find him after intercepting just 12 letters. Spreading disinformation about yourself takes time, but after a while the tapestry of deceptions will practically weave itself. Ensure that your communications and data are encrypted in transit and at rest whenever applicable. This means PGP for e-mail and OTR for instant messaging conversations. If you have to give data to someone, encrypt it first. For the tor-only box you use for interacting with your hidden service, full disk encryption is required. Make a password that's as long and complex as you can remember (""chippy1337"" is not an example of a good password). Last but not least, when you're done using your dedicated tor computer, boot into memtest86+. Memtest86+ is a tool for checking RAM for errors, but in order to do that it has to write into each address. Doing so essentially erases the contents of the RAM. Turning your computer off isn't good enough. [8] If you're planning to use TAILS, it will scrub the RAM for you automatically when you shut down. Once your RAM is clean, remove the power cord and any batteries if you're feeling extra paranoid. The chips will eventually lose any information that is still stored in them, which includes your key. The feds can do a pre-dawn raid if they want, but if you follow this step and refuse to disclose your password, you'll make James Comey cry like a small child. Use fake info when signing up for hosting services. Obfuscate the money trail as much as possible and supply fake billing info. I prefer registering as criminals who are on the run, high government officials, or people I dislike. If your box gets seized and your hosting company coughs up the info, or if a hacking group steals your provider's customer database (It happens more often than you'd think), your hosting information needs to lead to a dead end. All signs in Operation Onymous point to operators being IDed because they used real info to register for hosting service and then their box got decloaked. Speaking of money, you're going to have to figure out how to launder your newfound assets, and we're not talking about using a couple bitcoin laundering services and calling it a day. You also shouldn't go out and buy a Tesla. Living beyond your means is a key red flag that triggers financial and fraud investigations. Remember, money is just another attack vector. Washing ill-gotten gains is a time-honored drug business tradition and one that you would be a fool not to engage in. You can only use your hard-won profits to send shitexpress.com packages to people you don't like so many times. Take-away: If you rely only on tor to protect yourself, you're going to get owned and people like me are going to laugh at you. Remember that someone out there is always watching, and know when to walk away. Do try to stay safe while breaking the law. In the words of Sam Spade, ""Success to crime!""

44,cybercrime,DarkNetMarkets,Silk Goxed: How DPR used Mtgox for hedging &amp; lost big,194,2tgymg,http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2tgymg/silk_goxed_how_dpr_used_mtgox_for_hedging_lost_big/,2015-01-24 12:46:59,"Summary: &gt; Using recent filings in the trial of Ross Ulbricht, the 2014 leak by hackers of the Mtgox database, and a Mtgox insider, we identify Ulbricht's Mtgox account, the accessing IP, and trades made by it. The account information indicates that SR1 implemented its currency hedging system (intended to prevent vendor losses due to BTC fluctuations) by, starting in July 2011, connecting to Mtgox over the clearnet and trading through a Mtgox account. Surprisingly, it seems that this IP information was *not* used by the US government investigation to de-anonymize SR1. The bulk of the account seems to have been stolen by a Mtgox or SR1 insider. (This was primarily researched by /u/impost_r, and written by /u/gwern .) Silk Road 1 launched in January 2011. During 2011, the exchange rate for Bitcoin experienced extreme volatility, moving by orders of magnitude, which made it difficult to transact using Bitcoin because payment for an order could easily become less than the order cost. In response to this, Dread Pirate Roberts 1 introduced in [9 July 2011 a hedging system](URL vendors could lock in the USD value of any purchase and receive, when the transaction settled, the USD value in Bitcoins back. The obvious way to implement a hedging system is to maintain an account on a large exchange (the largest then being Mtgox) and transfer bitcoins in and buy/sell to match each purchase; but this would incur fees for trading, counterparty risk (not just the exchange collapsing/being hacked but also the account being seized), complexity, and risking de-anonymization (Mtgox and other exchanges do not look kindly on Tor connections due to abuse). It was not clear how DPR had implemented hedging; he could have self-insured, betting on Bitcoins long-term upwards trend to profit on average. The hedging system was a success, and was used from July 2011 to October 2013 when SR1 was raided, with perhaps occasional hiccups. In January 2015, as part of the ongoing trial of DPR (Ross Ulbricht), the prosecutors released [a letter with several exhibits](URL objecting to the defense strategy of painting the owner of Mtgox, Mark Karpeles, as the real DPR. It writes: &gt; Several days after the defendants arrest on October 1, 2013, which was publicly disclosed the following day, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York (USAO-SDNY) was contacted by Mr. Karpeles attorney. The attorney offered to forward records associated with a certain suspicious MtGox account that he stated he had previously sent to AUSA-2 in USAO-Baltimore. The attorney stated that MtGox had also found a different account, in the defendants own name, which the attorney said he could supply records for as well. &gt; &gt; Mr. Karpeles attorney subsequently forwarded via email the information he had previously sent to AUSA-2 concerning the account MtGox deemed suspicious. (See Ex. E). As reflected in the email, the attorney explained that the forwarded information was not information about the account in Ulbrichts name, which MtGox only identified as of interest after the Ulbricht indictment [i.e., arrest]. (Id. (emphasis in original)). The forwarded information related instead to a MtGox account as to which MtGox ha[d] suspicions may be associated with the largest bitcoin wallet that is perceived by some in the bitcoin community to be associated with Silk Road. (Id.) (Bitcoin users had long speculated about Bitcoin wallets or addresses connected to the Silk Road website, based on analyses of the Blockchain. 5 Thus, it appeared the MtGox account in question had transactions involving these addresses.) &gt; &gt; The email from Mr. Karpeles attorney further explained that there was other suspicious activity connected to the account. The account was initially opened by someone using the email address davidmaisano@inbox.com, but later, when the customer was required to validate his identity, he did so using documents that reflected a different name from the one on the email account. Moreover, the user deposited a large number of bitcoins into the account, which he converted to nearly $2 million in U.S. dollars, but the user never withdrew the funds off of MtGoxs system to an external bank account. Eventually, the money was converted back to Bitcoins and transferred out of MtGox. However, after the transfer, the user contacted MtGox saying that he could not access the account, claiming it had been hacked. After MtGox told the user that it appeared his credentials had previously been changed pursuant to a valid user request, the customer did not inquire further or, as far as MtGox was aware, report the hack to law enforcement, despite the large amount of funds removed from the account. &gt; &gt; After receiving the records for the account, investigators working with USAO-SDNYs investigation of Silk Road were able to tie the davidmasiano@inbox.com MtGox account to the defendant through various means. For example, MtGox records showed the account being consistently accessed through IP addresses that traced back to the defendant. Moreover, transactional records from the account were included as attachments to certain emails recovered from the defendants Gmail account, which was searched pursuant to a search warrant. This may sound relatively innocuous: AUSA-2 in USAO-Baltimore ignored the original email, and by the time USAO-SDNY took it seriously, Ulbricht had already been arrested, and then with all the information in hand and his IP, an account which did nothing was found. So what? Well, as an exhibit (pg18), it quotes an email from Mt. Gox lawyer Scott was sent to USDOJ on 24 July 2013 and forwarded to Serrin Turner (U.S. attorney / cybercrime coordinator) on 15 October 2013 (emphasis added): &gt; The user deposited a large number of bitcoins into the account. The user used the bitcoins to purchase U.S. dollars, but the account was never linked to a bank account to make a withdrawal. *The transactional records for the account are too voluminous to provide via e-mail.* Im happy to discuss a method and format to provide the records to you. &gt; &gt; In May 2013, the user contacted MtGox to report that the account was hacked. MtGox informed the user that the e-mail address associated with the account had been changed pursuant to a proper request to change the address. A copy of the exchange with the user regarding the hack is also attached to this e-mail. Following the exchange attached to this e-mail, the user did not communicate further with MtGox, and MtGox is not aware that the user made any report to law enforcement. &gt; Prior to the user contacting MtGox regarding the hack, the approximately U.S. $1.9 million had been converted to bitcoins. The bitcoins (7393.49 BTC) were transferred to address 1AsUc3Lw1oDmwimWoGeCfBngzziS98FP5V (7393.49 BTC). MtGox is aware that some of these bitcoin were used, and the balance (6393.49 BTC) currently remain at address 1Mh58EcGSMMscgh5qE5u4BVSL9KRd8GzQK. MtGox believes 1000 BTC were sold on exchange btc-e.com. Unlike in the main body, this says something interesting - The transactional records for the account are too voluminous to provide via e-mail. So if DPR was not using this account to cash out commissions from SR1, but it was heavily trading only to eventually withdraw a noticeably smaller sum of bitcoins, what on earth was this account doing? The obvious possibility is: the davidmaisano Mtgox account implemented the SR1 hedging system. We identified the 7393.49 BTC withdrawal using a blockchain search, using wallet identification based on multiple input transactions, and tracking back change addresses we could see that the same entity received 8630 BTC in another transaction origination from Mt. Gox. Ulbricht seems to have stopped using the Mtgox account around May 2013. All activity on the account stopped after the last withdrawal, leaving a negligible amount of funds in the account. Why? There are two possible reasons: 1. The account hack. The hack appears to have been genuine and not some sort of attempt to scam Mtgox: [a 05/29/13 journal entry presented in court](URL shows that Ulbricht thought the DEA stole 2mln usd from his Mt. Gox account, a loss confirmed in the [spreadsheet Ulbricht kept of SR1-related transactions](URL (exhibit GX-250). 2. In the 2013 journal, Ulbricht comments on 03/24/2013 that he had been been slowly raising the cost of hedging, suggesting he was trying to discourage use of it. On 04/10/2013, he writes some vendors using the hedge in a falling market to profit off of me by buying from themselves. turned of access log pruning so I can investigate later. market crashed today. This suggests he was no longer keen on the hedging system and was planning on scrapping it anyway when the vendors began abusing it, the market crashed (increasing losses), and then on top of that, the account was drained by what he believed was the DEA (see the journal &amp; spreadsheet entries) a month later. ## MtGox2014Leak.zip In early 2014, Russian hackers gained access to Mtgox backend servers (possibly with the help of insiders) and released [a public torrent](magnet:?xt=urn:btih:b6545ecc7db8d44c8cbc4e93989edf8221af75f5&amp;dn=2014+Mt.+Gox+Leak&amp;tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80&amp;tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.publicbt.com%3A80&amp;tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.istole.it%3A6969&amp;tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.ccc.de%3A80&amp;tr=udp% 3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337) containing dumps of Mtgox databases up to December 2013 and held the rest back for sale.

The email specifies that The bitcoins (7393.49 BTC) were transferred to address AsUc3Lw1oDmwimWoGeCfBngzziS98FP5V (7393.49 BTC)., which is an unusual number of BTC.

Back to the 2 withdrawals mentioned above; we can see the 8360 BTC withdrawal 1.5 hours before the 7393.49 BTC one. So not only did this confirm that the same entity that received the 7393.49 BTC received the 8630 BTC as well, it shows that its a withdrawal from the same account. These are not the only two entries for the account 3fcf63cc. Isolating the entries, we have almost all deposits and withdrawals to that account, ~100 in total. This is an odd amount of activity for an account portrayed as nearly inactive. Further, we can see a withdrawal of 40,000 BTC: URL then 2 months later, a deposit of 44,814.031337back into the same account: URL The agent Der-Yeghiayan testifies on 20 January 2015 that they were focusing on what seems to have been a different account ([pg102-107](URL perhaps explaining the general lack of LE interest in the other activities.

The 40,000 BTC withdrawal had caught our interest as this was the maximum amount of bitcoin that could be withdrawn within a day at the time, it also meant the user was verified as the limit for unverified users as the time was a mere 4000 BTC per day, the insider confirmed that the account had AML2 status (notarized verification). An example order from the leaked files: 1312614863842963,""2011-08-06 07:14:23"",6534,NJP,sell,USD,29.70994053,292.03445,78.59413634758,22952.195381491,0.8761,78.59413634758,68.856322854115,0,0 Isolating all trade entries associated with the account, [17,049 unique entries were found](URL (Note that interpreting Mtgox trade records can be challenging; for example, the data is occasionally corrupt, and not all of these are separate orders since the exchange splits them into multiple orders in order to match them with various counter parties.) Looking at the entries, the easiest way to identify multiple trades as belonging to a single buy or sell order is to group them based on timestamps. Individual trades are visualised in [this graph](URL [aggregated by day](URL [aggregated by day, and log USD value](URL the periods of inactivity can be clearly be seen. The account was registered around April 2011 (logs from Jeb McCalebs Mtgox apparently were known to be incomplete), and began trading 5 May 2011 (2 months before the hedging went live). This has two main implications: 1. This activity is consistent with either hedging, or DPR1 being a trader who doesnt care about cashing out and being so bad he could lose much of his money in a bull market This is an astonishingly large amount of bitcoins even at the time, would have represented a large fraction of Mtgoxs deposits, and substantial trading volume. It seems difficult to believe that Mtgox did not at least suspect the account of being linked with SR1. (The insider claims they had not realized what the account was for until we began asking about it.) 2. The exact rationale behind the switching between buying and selling doesnt seem clear. Given that Ulbrichts journal/memoirs describes him as barely being able to program when he began Silk Road in January 2011 and learning desperately on the fly, it may be that he implemented the simplest possible form of hedging: building up a cushion of USD early on by selling all hedging bitcoins, and then later buying back due to exchange rate decreases. Itd be worthwhile to analyze this further by looking at the Mtgox exchange rate movements. ## IP addresses It gets even more interesting: The insider noted that the Mtgox IP logs indicate that before the hedging went live, the account connected over the clearnet from probably Ulbrichts house, these IP addresses were identifiable as unprotected because they werent registered to a server host (the IP addresses that were servers were most likely Tor exit nodes and/or VPNs). More recently (presumably in 2013), 3fcf63cc did not just connect over IPs connected to Ulbricht (which could easily be himself logging in personally to do normal trading), but an IP, `207.106.6.28`, connected to the Mtgox API for trading. The prefix `207.106.6.` should be familiar to those who have followed the SR1 case in detail, since it is the prefix of one of the server IPs listed in the [civil asset forfeiture request filed in NY to seize SR1s bitcoins](URL after the October 2013 raid. Specifically, the seizure lists the IP `207.106.6.32`. In other words, the SR1 backend server appears to have been connecting over the clearnet to Mtgox for its regular hedging transactions. (This is not unprecedented: Ulbricht did SR1 backups to his JTAN account over clearnet because he complained Tor was too slow, and also used a VPN.) This is a serious anonymity leak: blockchain analysis has lead investigators to [Mt. Gox deposit addresses as early as April 2012](URL a subpoena or request for trading records would show a distinct pattern of large trades which screamed hedging to anyone familiar with the operation of SR1. Was this how the Iceland server was identified? Probably not. The server image in all filings has been described as having been obtained 23 July 2013, which is 1 day before the original Mtgox email was sent, and would have to have been located and then requested earlier, Further, this would have been a perfectly legitimate investigative strategy, indeed, its almost surprising that they *didnt* follow the money and de-anonymize SR1 in April 2012, or even 2011, when the FBI investigation began, and doubly surprising that they could be interested in Karpeles and Mtgox but not get the trading records. There was considerable pressure to take down SR1 as soon as possible (see Der-Yeghiayans testimony), and there was no reason to wait until July 2013 to image the SR1 server and use such a strange and cockamamie excuse like Agent Tarbells (undocumented) story of hacking SR1s CAPTCHA. Interestingly, the Mt. Gox insider noted that it was unlikely investigators had any transactional logs of the Mt. Gox account(s) before their attorney sent investigators the full logs in July 2013. This all also suggests that one could measure SR1 revenue over time by examining the hedging trades to estimate how much hedged volume there was, however it is uncertain to what extent hedging was done on the exchange, a possibility is that hedging was done both on and off-exchange as there are some significant gaps during which the account identified has no trade logs. Something that supports this is the previously quoted [journal](URL entry: &gt; '03/24/2013 / been slowly raising the cost of hedging; / orgainzed local files and notes' We see that through 19-21 March 2013 a large amount of BTC is bought on the account, during this same time period roughly 40,000 BTC is withdrawn from the exchange in 3 separate transactions. this could indicate that funds were transferred off exchange for a more risky hedging method(risky in the sense that Ulbricht would take the loss if price collapsed). (This all raises an interesting alternative history question: suppose SR1 had not been raided in October 2013; Mtgox collapsed not too long afterwards; what would have happened to SR1 when Mtgox vaporized? Did SR1 still have a significant amount of funds on Mt. Gox? Would SR1 have collapsed or DPR1 covered the loss of the hedging funds out of his own pocket? Would the trustees have figured out the DPR1 account and turned it and all the IPs over to law enforcement? Or would people have been motivated to examine the leak for possible DPR1 activity?) An important note regarding the leaked files: the insider believes parts of them to have been altered by hackers, possibly the same ones that released the files. Further, we learned that the original files were altered too. Further, hackers had full read/write access to all Mt. Gox servers for 3 days, deleting server logs after they were finished. However, we cant find any rumors or evidence that the Ulbricht account was known to anyone, much less the 2014 Mtgox hackers, so it is a priori likely that the Ulbricht transactions are not tampered with specifically. ## Who Stole Ulbrichts Coins? We know from the original email that this was Ulbrichts account, and we now know it was the hedging account rather than a way of cashing out or day-trading, due to its timing, activities, and lack of fiat withdrawals. But that doesnt answer the question: where did the coins go and who took them? Ulbricht claims, complaining to Mtgox support, that he was hacked. He might be lying, but the same claim appears in his personal records where he has no reason to continue the pretense. Specifically, he thinks his coins were seized by the DEA. 1. The government did not take them. This is definitely wrong because the internal Mtgox records show purchases of Bitcoin and then a normal Bitcoin withdrawal rather than seizure of USD balance, there was no government announcement then, and still has been none. 2. A hacker did not take them based on the notorious Mtgox 2011 leak of usernames/password-MD5-hashes: we've checked but the ""davidmaisano"" account is simply not included in that dump (although interestingly, an account named ""altoid"" is), so as attractive and simple as this explanation would be, it's impossible - the account could not have been exploited by cracking the password hash since no such hash was available. 3. A vendor probably did not take them. Our insider suggests a SR1 vendor may have figured the hedging system and somehow broken into the account and taken them. (Specifically, that they have some elements that could show vendors from Silk Road stealing and/or hacking Mt. Gox; further details were not given to us to protect his identity.) But its not clear how a vendor would even know SR1 genuinely used hedging, used it on Mtgox, which account it was on Mtgox, get the password or authentication token, and get in to drain it. 4. A Mtgox insider may have taken it. If they realized what the account was, it would be easy to log in, and withdraw the coins to sell on BTC-E. They would also know that Ulbricht would be unable to complain to LE, and easily verify the account to get higher withdraw limits. (Tampering with the records might also explain some anomalies and missing entries, but might not.) 5. A SR1 insider may have taken it. Ulbricht hired multiple people (smedley, Variety Jones/cimon, utah, etc) to work on coding and maintaining the site, and the hedging functionality was written in early 2011, when his coding was most amateurish and insecure. He showed a propensity for hardwiring values (the JTAN backup IP, the VPN login IP). If he hardwired the username/password or something of that ilk, any one who saw that part of the codebase could have easily engineered the theft; various employees had access to the codebase and sometimes the server itself (eg. ""...04/21 - 04/30/2013: market and forums under sever DoS attack. Gave 10k btc ransom but attack continued. Gave smed server access...""). In which case, the question is not why the hedging account was burgled in 2013, but why it wasnt burgled earlier. ## Anomalies &amp; Missing entries EDIT: removed section about 3 missing rows. Appears to have been a glitch in downloading over HTTP or grepping the 2014 Mtgox leak, please disregard. An additional anomaly is the account-verification status. Mtgox required identification for very large withdrawals like the 40k BTC withdrawal on 6-9-2012 or the final withdrawal of 4933 BTC made by the putative hacker, and this identity verification is attested to in the government email. But nevertheless, the transaction records mark each transaction with the Mtgox code of ""!!"" for an unverified or untrustworthy account, from the beginning to the end: 1351795530115354,2012-11-01 18:45:30,6534,NJP,sell,USD,8.23742072,91.91536,79.874,7341.627,0.25736,79.874,20.556,0,0,!!, ... 1367843632129978,""2013-05-06 12:33:52"",6534,22fa9cb7-edfa-475e-a598-7b6b0d147ea5,45fe9a2df91b0b67779de6646a32fe42,NJP,buy,USD,134.13461537,16753.41346,98.063,1642892.307,0,98.063,0,0.40240385,4511.694,!!, It's not 100% clear whether the '!!' notation refers to identify-verification or whether it might also here be referring to the account being accessed from multiple countries' IPs (which is certainly the case for SR1, which according to the [master server list document from Ulbricht's laptop, exhibit GX-264](URL bounced from country to country). ## TODO Open questions: 1. How much did Mtgox really know and when did it know it? 2. Who were the Silk Road insiders and what information did they give, and to who? 3. Does this account, the account(s) the FBI investigation focused on, or any other Silk Road link to Mt. Gox have any connection to Mt. Goxs massive losses? 4. Does the hacking and big withdrawal account for most of DPR1s missing bitcoins? The coins seized from the SR1 servers and Ulbrichts laptop do not add up to the recorded SR1 commissions 5. How was Ulbrichts Mtgox account hacked, exactly? The davidmaisano account was not part of the 2011 Mtgox username/password leak, so the password hash could not have been cracked; altoid was, but should have no connection. Or was it indeed SR1 vendors? And if so, how exactly did they go from suspecting that SR1 was hedging on Mtgox to being able to control the exact account and do withdrawals? Could they have hacked the SR1 backend and instead of settling for the hot wallet, stole the authentication for the Mtgo API and drained the account that way? Or, could it have been another Mtgox insider who, observing the trading, realized what the account was for and quietly drained it with some bitcoin withdrawals, knowing that Ulbricht would be unable to do anything but complain to Mtgox? 6. Did the trades stop in May 2013 because the account was hacked? Did activity switch to a different Mtgox account, a different exchange (such as BTC-E), or did DPR1 switch to self-insuring? 6. How much did Mtgox make off the hedging trades directly, or was its tolerance more strategic and about not interfering with SR1? There are BTC/USD fees for each transaction but it's a bit difficult to convert that into a total. 7. Is hedging on exchange intrinsically unsafe for any large black-market due to the distinctive signature, increased counterparty risk, and high volume of trades? ## Code The CSV file follows a schema like thus: Trade_Id,Date,User_Id,Japan,Type,Currency,Bitcoins,Money,Money_Rate,Money_JPY,Money_Fee,Money_Fee_Rate,Money_Fee_JPY,Bitcoin_Fee,Bitcoin_Fee_JPY Or by column-number: 1.
