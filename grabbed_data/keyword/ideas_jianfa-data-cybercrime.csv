I have several security concerns for your investigation at my site: [URL and below: **Some of the security staff and criminals are orphans.** :\~( If a parent at the mall reports her child missing, why not train all mall's staff including security staff up to the cleaner to use their phone to take a photo of the missing child shown from the moms phone and send to the malls messaging group chat, radio security, mall management, other in-store management so all staff in the mall, not just the security personnel and keep an eye out and look for the child. I know the business as usual and time is money is important. What about the millions of dollars worth of publicity if you implement the above method and is able to locate the lost child? How about turning the mom and her circle of influence into forever big spender customers for the mall? What if the mom is a billionaire or millionaire that donates a hefty sum of money to management and you when her child is found? After the photo is circulated, then u can implement the usual 5K HD zoom in out security cameras, security and staff at each mall exits, etc. **Risk: Criminal take your fingerprint to unlock your phone when you are drunk &amp; sleeping &gt;&gt;** Significant security risk: smartphones need to hold at a certain angle for slow biometric face, and iris unlock resulting in users discarding the use of face and iris unlock but heavy reliance on fingerprint unlock due. High-security breach risk when the victim is sleeping, perhaps blackmailed partner will take his fingerprint to unlock &amp; access his phone while the victim is sleeping to download entire data to access state secrets/gang bosses / military generals' email addresses and other data for cybercrime with a plethora of infinite scenarios for creative criminal uses.

Exception scenario is nap during the day leading to criminal access of user's phone. What do you think of the above as a real-life scenario or fictional movie plot to sell to make money to help the unfortunate orphans and donate money to charity? **Alleged Dark Net as a platform to monitor &amp; entrap criminals so people can get promoted &gt;&gt;** everybody knows what the darknet is, then it is no longer a secret. Yet criminals who think that they are anonymous ( are actually not anonymous to the people who are after them ) post incriminating contents on the darknet. In a sense, isn't darknet a place to mine secrets to catch criminals to put up names for others to get promoted? Average users are on the open web. You just need an HTML5 compliant browser to get access to it. Even older browsers will work to access the internet. It's the successor to gopher compliant Net sites, and before that BBS and ARPANET. The deep net requires some kind of credentials and/or authorisation to browse around. [Facebook.com](URL is on the open net as the root Net site [facebook.com/](URL a slash is indicative of root level in \*nix and most other operating systems (including windows). Dark Net content may also be password protected or otherwise encrypted, or even hidden/forbidden content. The darknet is what's hidden on the onion router, which is actually a Net of interconnected computers that are provided by the browser Tor when you log in to it. It's an intranet that sits on top of the existing internet that while expansive is really no different to your internal intranet for your school/business in a lot of ways other than how you connect to it. Anything can be on the darknet from illegitimate to legitimate and a grey area content in between. Links are called onions... It's quite hard to get around, links are often unreliable, and searches may not bring up legitimate content. It's the best advice and practice to stay away from the darknet. Some secrets end up there from time to time, including the report from the selection process for Australia's next-generation submarines that randomly popped up on the darknet a few years ago now. You can get around safely on the darknet if you are adamant about it, just use a VPN that also supports TOR, and you should be relatively safe from leaving any footprints. I still wouldn't advocate visiting it because there are a lot of things on there that are illegal or if not unlawful, you just plain would not want to see... The darknet has no real moral purpose, it just is, it's just there... Tor itself is not a VPN, a lot of people have foolishly thought that Tor will protect them by itself. While it's harder to find people, onions have been compromised before, and people have been exposed. If you want more privacy, you need a VPN. You can use Tor to access the clear net, but it's notorious for being painfully slow even with a fast cable or VDSL connection. My interpretation of its darknet is an offshoot to appear everyone is safe. But if you put it on the internet (reliable or otherwise) your joining the rest anyway. Tor is an example. Load a browser with privacy add-ons from developers you don't may not even know/or trust, and people will change their attitude. If by ""entrap"" you mean baiting with honeypots....its an ancient IT tradition that still has its purposes ...see Wikipedia for more info. Yes, there are plenty of honeypot operations on the darknet, there are also raids and stings. As I said above the darknet is not impenetrable, onions have been compromised by the FBI, CIA, Interpol, FIVEYES operations whoever, whatever... That's not without just compromising forum/groups/pages on the darknet and bringing down an entire ring/crime gang, whatever it is related to whether it's The Silk Road or pedo rings... It is nowhere safe on the internet, a VPN can do a pretty good job of hiding your IP, but humans are fallible and having your IP isn't the be-all and all. Social engineering can often uncover traits about human beings and their behaviours and then it doesn't matter how many proxies you're hiding behind... Social engineering and honeypot operations are some of the oldest tricks in the book, they're simple enough a teenager could understand how to use them, and they still work because the very nature of the human condition is fallibility no matter how perfect you try to be. There are already over 30 versions of Tor. Some work for particular regions, some work for all regions. And then you have the private darknet, which is not searchable at all. Either you have a link to some content, or you don't. That's the best way for authorities to catch out criminal activity because you need to garner a link from person-to-person communication. And as I have to keep mentioning to people, a VPN will not protect you and keep you anonymous. Authorities can track bespoke ('magic') packets to your house. Remember, folks, encryption is all just mathematics. Certain law enforcement agencies can know how a bespoke packet looks after encryption and can track it across the world to your home address (and then your personal details obtained from your ISP, for prosecution). There are already over 30 versions of Tor. Some work for particular regions, some work for all regions. Of course, there are Talis just being another popular one. A VPN will not protect you and keep you anonymous. No, it won't it just makes it a little more complicated, it also creates other complexities though. When ASIS, ASIO or the AFP ask for a warrant to access your data from some company in Russia you've been using as a proxy... Do you think that they're going to comply? You know, just roll over and say here, have all our data? There are a lot of companies on the record out there who are on the record as being entirely non-compliant when it comes to handing over access to data. It's up to you to choose wisely. And even if they get your data, what the hell do you think they're going to do with it, especially if it's encrypted... Add the standard encryption that a company like Apple offers to you should you choose it, and it's pretty much a case of seeing you in the next million years... Like I said, security is a game of cat and mouse... Neither the authorities or those who break the law are really winning, it's just about trying to stay one step ahead and aware of what's going on. **Separately, refer to the screenshot below, when the user clicked on the Email Us link on the footer of your website:** [URL Your email hyperlink that populates the email app is wrong. It shows [contact@wilsonsecurity.com.au:25](mailto:contact@wilsonsecurity.com.au:25), or something like that with 25 at the back.

Police and soldiers are murderers that kill to protect us. Impoverished criminals are murderers too. One perspective out of infinities. Just like the fictional and science fictional cartoons, anime, movies on the internet, cinemas and TV &lt;&lt;&lt;** &amp;#x200B; To Chief of Security Service MI5, PO Box 3255 London SW1P 1AE Please kindly review the below &amp; share with your research team on feasibility for the benefits of your defence force. For the below insights that are not realistic for the current timeline, why not sell as science fiction anime, movie, drama &amp; novels plots to make real money for defence research, buy real weapons and train soldiers? &amp;#x200B; URL **100% helicopter pilots &amp; VIP passengers deaths from crash reduced** Why not build a prototype helicopter akin to the design attached where the pilot &amp; passenger can parachute eject up &amp; out of the helicopter as the rotor system blades are below the helicopter in the event of vehicle malfunction? This will save the lives of military men worldwide from current to future generations till human extinction but possibility design continuation by human replacements. :) You can alternatively take this &amp; sell as science fiction plot in anime, manga, cartoons, novels, movies, Netflix to max your money for charity. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **Spaceship pursuit** Imagine medium-sized spaceship pursuing enemy craft. When crafts approached narrow valley crevice, medium spaceship won't fit. Enemy small craft entered crevice. Before crashing into the edge of the valley, the commander cabin of the medium spacecraft auto disengaged (based on 360-degree long-range sensors) from the rest of the ship into smaller spacecraft with weapons to pursue the enemy craft. Rest of medium unmanned spacecraft autopilot fly over the valley to the crevice exit (crab pincer manoeuvre) to cut off the escape route of enemy. Enemy craft destroyed. Small commander spacecraft fly straight into the hole in medium spacecraft. The small craft stopped, doesnt rotate &amp; commander seat doesn't rotate as screens show 360 degrees (eliminate movement waste). Fly off. Why not apply above to real-life Airforce or sell as a plot in science fiction to take money to be used for weapons research or donate to charity? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **Safety - Add Police Blue &amp; White Boxes Tape to Security Camera as Business Opportunity to Max Money $$$ for Charity and Deter Crime** Police colours are designed as blue &amp; white boxes tape. Thus make security signs wiring exterior plastic case body (doesnt obstruct glass cam case) as blue &amp; white. Its either you camouflage your security camera as pinhole and hidden but if you make a big cam on the ceiling where everyone can see easily, why not add blue &amp; white boxes police tape around the security cam to double security effectiveness. In all crime, robbery and thievery, the thief will locate the location of the security cams, imagine you are a thief that look at a black ceiling security camera, it's just a cam and you as a thief get high from destroying the cam, but if u add a $0.50 police tape around the cam, it will communicate to the criminal's subconscious triggering series of past experience with police thus effectively deterring crime to protect the assets, houses and women inside the houses belonging to gang bosses, army generals, police chiefs, CEOs, everyday people, non-financially independent criminals that cannot afford to be robbed and politicians. Will adding blue &amp; white police tape around security camera circuit casing help to deter crime by triggering the criminal's past experience with police when he sees the camera? Will this be good for a thesis or sell as a science fiction plot? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Imagine a secret photo gallery app icon &gt; user takes photo &gt; photo saved to gallery &gt; app auto uploads photo/video to cloud drive and auto-delete from the phone, or just use the conferencing app to video record everything and the other end autosave to encrypted cloud drive thus no trace on phone. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Why not chloroform gloves to put enemy soldiers to sleep? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Wear a ring with a square mirror with rounded corners as its ""emblem"" on the finger that key in pin code, so the agent can see people behind if peeping at him entering phone or safe or door pin or as a deterrent or reminder to check behind if others peeping. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Why not make a laptop with fish eye-full 180 degrees webcam lens with each phone/laptop unlock, secret security app start take video until part of the human head comes into front camera view, then keep taking video until full-face or an eye comes into view. auto upload video to the cloud. Using similar to google photos people recognition software, when app sees that the face in the photo doesn't belong to you, it will send an email to your secret email account with the photos and give your phone a missed call the next day with a phone no. that only you recognise that it belongs to that security app that generates random phone no. Separately, why not upgrade laptop webcam to smartphone 4K quality with always-on webcam paired to another security app. Webcam AI sees that there isn't any part of a human face or body (not necessarily the owner), it will auto-lock the laptop immediately. Separately, Webcam app AI based on preset settings toggle, when webcam sees you or ""you &amp; other humans"", laptop stays unlock, when webcam doesn't see you, the laptop will auto-lock. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; TECH: Important security risk, Samsung phone need to hold at a certain angle for slow biometric face and iris unlock. Thus users don't use face and iris intelligent unlock but fingerprint unlock. High risk when the victim is sleeping after drunk sex, his blackmailed partner, mistress or whore or all three will take his fingerprint to unlock &amp; access his phone while you (victim) is sleeping to download entire data to access state secrets/gang bosses / military generals' email addresses and data for the cybercrime with a plethora of infinite scenarios for creative criminal uses. E.g. scapegoating. Why not update smartphone biometric functions that have a schedule? E.g. auto fingerprint unlock profile during day time and auto-switch to intelligent face/iris unlock profile during sleeping hours, toggled by the user in system settings? Exception scenario is drunk sex nap during the day lead to criminal access of user's phone. &amp;#x200B; Why not improve Face &amp; Iris Phone unlock security by only allow phone unlock when there is slight head sway from left to right so criminal cannot use hand to push victim eyelids to open and unlock the victim's phone when he is drunk and sleeping after sex? &amp;#x200B; Note 9 and future phones need to turn off notification e.g. google or other app security codes on the lock screen by default for security to prevent quick peep by criminals or office colleagues that are frenemies. &amp;#x200B; Criminal remotely activate Tesla cars' airbag so airbag hit victim's face &amp; car crash injuring or killing the victim. &amp;#x200B; Alternatively, lock car doors, activate all airbags to knock everyone in car unconscious then auto-drive victims/criminals to the police station or to gang boss. &amp;#x200B; **Pepper Spray** Please feedback to Legear management &amp; pepper spray manufacturers on ur e.g pepper spray sabre aerosol can &amp; other brands if in the pocket it's hard to be sure which direction is the nozzle pointing correctly. This results in a time delay due to time wasted in adjusting the pepper spray to point at the attacker. &amp;#x200B; A better design to ascertain the correct direction of the nozzle would be with fingers touch feeling (like for blind people) when can in the pocket is one side of the spray is rough grooves compared to the other smooth sides. &amp;#x200B; Other brands use a ring below the nozzle so when U r feeling the spray in the pocket, the nozzle spray outlet will point the right direction forward to eliminate time delay. &amp;#x200B; **Sniper Rifle** Why not make a Sniper Rifle that doesnt need to reload one bullet at a time? Auto bullets chain feed like a machine gun for continuous fire. &amp;#x200B; **Safe with integrated fingerprint and pin code systems.** Make &amp; Sell Safe (storing state secrets) with pin pad with numeric pins input, but enter"" key is secretly integrated with a fingerprint scanner - looks like normal enter key. After user key in pin and use full index finger touch on Enter"" key, the system will check both entered pin and fingerprint to authenticate and unlock. Some safe may have a separate fingerprint scanner at the side, but the above eliminate wasted time &amp; wasted energy from wasted movement from moving your fingertips from the pin pad to the fingerprint scanner. Sell above as movie, manga, sci-fi, novel, etc plots to make real $$$ for defence research &amp; buy soldiers. &amp;#x200B; **How to enter number pad to enter the door or open safe quickly** Left hand one finger &amp; right hand one finger to press the keypad to unlock the door or safe quickly for army operations. &amp;#x200B; **Plain Clothes Police Ear Piece** Why do plainclothes police wear standard-issue white earpiece cable that makes the target easy to recognise them? Defeats the purpose of plain clothes. Why not black civilian sports earphone (most people wearing) for communication? **Police Teddy Bear** Victoria Police Cop Shop: Why not make a soldier or cop teddy bear with dog tag or badge with identity numbers on it that says 1/750 to indicate that the line is truly limited edition? Which will make the first edition to be sold at a much higher price? I hope this insight will increase current and future worldwide profits for the next few thousand years till the end of a teddy bear or human civilisations to max $ for the families of police and military. &amp;#x200B; **Tanks** Why not build-remote driven machine guns with thousands of armour piercing bullets on tank body that auto shoot humans within range of escaping quarantine zone using high accuracy thermal and movement sensors so soldiers won't be infected and bring infection to other parts of the world resulting in the extinction of humanity, boss and you and your loved ones? When the tank is disabled, remotely detonate skin burning chemical gas explosions. Protect remote-controlled auto-firing (via sensors) machine guns tanks by having the tanks emit lethal radiation. Machine gun tanks dont have protruding machine gun barrel rods so there is better protection. &amp;#x200B; **How to cheaply ensure locks are locked 100% eliminating human errors** Why not add a laminated sign next to all padlocks in the Military bases, construction sites &amp; other buildings in Singapore / worldwide where the sign (coloured paper with good background/text colour contrast) says ""TO LOCK"" It's ideal to have doors that auto-lock, when auto swing closed but unfortunately the installation of smart doors (see RMIT Uni Australia), are expensive with high maintenance costs which are not feasible for developing and third world countries such as Indonesia. Implementing such a sign will reduce theft, robbery, vandalism, stealing of firearms and everything related to crime. &amp;#x200B; **How to stop escaping criminal's vehicles** Rich man, VIP / President's house, museum or bank, military complex, Centre for Disease Control, etc robbed. Building Alarm auto rings to trigger traffic lights in 1km radius all auto turn red to use civilians vehicles to create a blockade to stop criminal's car from escaping with valuables. Police military helicopter flies to a location to arrest criminal with CCTV live footage. If all vehicles standstill, it's easy to spot escaping criminals vehicles. Implement in real life and sell as a movie, anime, manga, novels plot to max $$$ to buy rice farms to feed starving children. &amp;#x200B; **Hooligans** Historically in all wars, the hooligans from both sides that Incite the events leading to wars are the first to be sent as cannon fodder, I mean as Infantry to take the hit &amp; be killed. I say this to save Hoons lives even though hooligans have bullied me before. &amp;#x200B; **Binoculars** Imagine durable comfortable Flexi rubber padding for the part where your eyes touch the binoculars holes. Comfortable n no scratches on spectacles lenses. Great for Military / Bird Watching. &amp;#x200B; **Why treat each other with respect.** Its important to treat each other respect. When some are abused, out of &gt; a billion abused humans, one will harbour hatred so deep that he join the military to become commander &amp; manipulate countries to fight each other so millions will die to even result in atomic bomb warfares that kill Earth just to seek revenge &amp; ego boost. A similar example is the first emperor of China - Qin Shi Huang who was abused as a youth and enacted harsh punishments on scholars by burying them alive, hard labour to build Great Wall of China, punishing those who stood by who didnt help him when he was abused, etc. &amp;#x200B; **Bullets in a backpack to auto continuous reload guns.** Why not link modified AK47 or machine gun bullets chamber to backpack that auto feed bullets from a backpack into rifle to eliminate wasted time in thinking for bullets magazine, remove the existing empty magazine, search for the magazine, remove magazine pouch velcro, may drop the magazine, insert a magazine into the rifle - all the while standing exposed on the battlefield. Why not sell the above as anime, manga, sci-fi, novel, movie plots to max money to buy investment properties for self, I mean research $$ for real approved delegated defence projects that max salary $$$ increase? &amp;#x200B; **What if you are stranded &amp; lost in the forest?** Get to high ground, set a large forest fire to create huge smoke to get attention from satellite monitoring systems &amp; fire brigade. They send fire trucks down to put down the fire. You pretend to be lost hiker. Get a free drink, free food &amp; free ride home. &amp;#x200B; **Police cap with conspicuous logos on front &amp; back of the cap.** Hi, I felt that the police / military cap or uniform needs to have the police logo at the back of the cap/uniform as well to deter criminals from attacking the police from behind and also for citizens to quickly locate police to report crimes. Why dont police wear high visibility vests like Melbourne, Australia police to assist in service delivery and protection of citizens? &amp;#x200B; **Dog tag with blood type.** Why not add the symbol of blood &amp; alphabet of blood type inside the symbol on soldiers dog tag to save lives after solder injured from the fight? &amp;#x200B; URL **Shooting.** Instead of hesitating to shoot an attacker, why not instantly shoot both his legs to halt the attack &amp; save everybodys lives including the attackers life? &amp;#x200B; **Rioting.** Why will you do if rioters dump trucks of rubbish at government buildings, tourists attractions &amp; beaches? &amp;#x200B; **Vehicle Trailer.** When army vehicle attacked, why not the driver at a single press of a button from drivers seat auto detach baggage trailer using push, rotate any direction &amp; pull control lever to increase front vehicle speed to escape attack? Why not implement for personal vehicles? &amp;#x200B; **Bag**. Soldier's backpack n gear bag should have double cloth material to expand double storage space to carry killed enemy's gear. Sell in Gaming &amp; Movie patents. Maybe real-life maxes your money. &amp;#x200B; **Quickly unload backpack.** Imagine a rotate n press button mechanism to unload all soldier's backpack &amp; water gear except bullet magazines so the soldier will be more agile &amp; win the gunfight. Sell as game patent plot or real life to generate money for defence research, increase management salary, etc. **Dogs.** Please feedback to dog unit to crossbreed grey dog with the black dog to create camouflage (grey-black patterns) attack or sentry dog for greater efficiency and effectiveness. Implement in real life in the military or you can sell this concept in video games and use the profits to max your money $. &amp;#x200B; **Train a German Shepard or Rottweiler to attack via a photo &amp; scent of your victim.** Surgically plant remote tiny speakers inside both ears (next to eardrums) of the dog. Tie the dog via lease to a pole n sit the dog down. When your victim walks near the leased dog. Remotely unlock the lease &amp; give attack command to the dog via remote walkie talkie for the dog to bite &amp; kill the victim. OR just the walkie talkie to call your dog unit dog back to you from search &amp; rescue sometimes the whistle range is insufficient &amp; the whistle sounds are interrupted by other environmental noises? The guard dog's eyes that reflect lights, the paw movement sound, the barking sound alerts intruder of the presence of the guard dog early which is poor security. &amp;#x200B; **Why not install 360 degrees live cloud night vision video security feed camera** (A.I. cam that detects human figure / human heat pattern on the screen) with GPS on each guard dogs head and remove the vocal cords of the dog? &amp;#x200B; **Fighter Jet CS Tactic v0.2 (Creampie Surprise)** Problem: if enemy fighter plane jet gets behind ur jet, you are in trouble as you would be shot down. Given it's been so many years since we went to space, why not build jets that have a two-screen view in the cockpit like those smart cars. The top first screen shows the top, bottom, front 180 degrees all around vantage points, the second screen shows the top, bottom, rear 180 degrees all around vantage points. So if the enemy's jet gets behind ur jet, the pilot can engage the machine gun that pops down or up (rotatable 360 degrees) and based on the viewing screens that show the enemy jet from behind plus heat-seeking or manual targeting systems, the pilot though flying In front of the enemy, he can shoot missiles/bullets to the enemy that is behind him. Imagine your jet top &amp; bottom with machine guns that share single compartment of bullets with 360 degrees shooting range (care don't shoot ur own tail wing or side wings. Pilot's view online of sight of the back, front, top, bottom via a screen inside cockpit-like those smart cars. Even if the enemy plane is behind ur jet, u can rotate machine guns to point backwards to shoot enemy jet that is behind u. 1 second time difference determines whether your aircraft or your enemys aircraft gets shot down. Eliminate movement &amp; time waste of rotation machine gun movement by having multiple bullet outlets (consider the weight that affects jet speed) from a single circular cylinder machine gun chamber. **Why not implement above in mini drone jets that shoot backwards?** &amp;#x200B; URL &amp;#x200B; URL **Risk: Criminal take your fingerprint to unlock your phone when you are drunk &amp; sleeping &gt;&gt;** Significant security risk: smartphones need to hold at a certain angle for slow biometric face, and iris unlock resulting in users discarding the use of face and iris unlock but heavy reliance on fingerprint unlock due.

Yes, there are plenty of honeypot operations on the darknet, there are also raids and stings. As I said above the darknet is not impenetrable, onions have been compromised by the FBI, CIA, Interpol, FIVEYES operations whoever, whatever... That's not without just compromising forum/groups/pages on the darknet and bringing down an entire ring/crime gang, whatever it is related to whether it's The Silk Road or pedo rings... It is nowhere safe on the internet, a VPN can do a pretty good job of hiding your IP, but humans are fallible and having your IP isn't the be-all and all. Social engineering can often uncover traits about human beings and their behaviours and then it doesn't matter how many proxies you're hiding behind... Social engineering and honeypot operations are some of the oldest tricks in the book, they're simple enough a teenager could understand how to use them, and they still work because the very nature of the human condition is fallibility no matter how perfect you try to be. There are already over 30 versions of Tor. Some work for particular regions, some work for all regions. And then you have the private darknet, which is not searchable at all. Either you have a link to some content, or you don't. That's the best way for authorities to catch out criminal activity because you need to garner a link from person-to-person communication. And as I have to keep mentioning to people, a VPN will not protect you and keep you anonymous. Authorities can track bespoke ('magic') packets to your house. Remember, folks, encryption is all just mathematics. Certain law enforcement agencies can know how a bespoke packet looks after encryption and can track it across the world to your home address (and then your personal details obtained from your ISP, for prosecution). There are already over 30 versions of Tor. Some work for particular regions, some work for all regions. Of course, there are Talis just being another popular one. A VPN will not protect you and keep you anonymous. No, it won't it just makes it a little more complicated, it also creates other complexities though. When ASIS, ASIO or the AFP ask for a warrant to access your data from some company in Russia you've been using as a proxy... Do you think that they're going to comply? You know, just roll over and say here, have all our data? There are a lot of companies on the record out there who are on the record as being entirely non-compliant when it comes to handing over access to data. It's up to you to choose wisely. And even if they get your data, what the hell do you think they're going to do with it, especially if it's encrypted... Add the standard encryption that a company like Apple offers to you should you choose it, and it's pretty much a case of seeing you in the next million years... Like I said, security is a game of cat and mouse... Neither the authorities or those who break the law are really winning, it's just about trying to stay one step ahead and aware of what's going on. &amp;#x200B; **&gt;&gt;&gt; By making my insights public knowledge to preserve lives, it helps people to be aware and take the necessary precautions and defence, just like all sorts of weapons of destruction in life which are not evil in itself but the human using it. Police and soldiers are murderers that kill to protect us. Impoverished criminals are murderers too. One perspective out of infinities. Just like the fictional and science fictional cartoons, anime, movies on the internet, cinemas and TV &lt;&lt;&lt;**"

Scams targeting computers and mobile devices Remember: anything that connects to the internet is vulnerable. How the scam works Remote access scammers call you on the phone claiming that your computer is infected by viruses. If you follow their instructions, it will allow them to access and control your computer where they can steal information or install malware. They may also try to convince you to purchase anti-virus software, which usually turns out to be overpriced or freely available on the internet. Protect yourself Be wary of free downloads offering music, games, movies and access to adult sites. They may install harmful programs without you knowing. Keep your office networks, computers, and mobile devices secure. Update your security software, change passwords and back up your data regularly. Store your backups offsite and offline. [URL explains how to back-up your data and secure your mobile devices.  Do not open attachments or click on links in emails or social media messages youve received from strangersjust press delete. All scams have the potential for identity theft. Protecting yourself from scams also means keeping your personal information safe. Identity theft is a threat in every scam Most people associate scams with attempts to trick you out of your money. However, your information is also valuable to scammers. Scammers steal your personal details to commit fraudulent activities like making unauthorised purchases on your credit card or using your identity to open bank or telephone accounts. They might take out loans or carry out other illegal business under your name. They may even sell your information to other scammers for further illegal use. Having your identity stolen can be both nancially and emotionally devastating. It can take months to reclaim your identity, and the impact of having it stolen can last for years. As part of any scamScammers often ask for personal information in other scams. In a lottery scam, scammers often ask for a drivers licence or passport to prove your identity before they can release the prize money. In dating and romance scams, they might ask for information to sponsor their visa application to visit you in Australia. Remember: Giving away personal information to a scammer can be just as bad as giving away money. Keep your personal details to yourself and keep them secure. Protect yourself Think twice about what you say and do in an online environment Be careful sharing information about yourself online, including social media, blogs and other online forums. Stop and think before filling in surveys, entering competitions, clicking on links or attachments, or even befriending, liking or sharing something online. Beware of any request for your details or money Scammers will try to trick you into handing over your data by using the names of well-known companies or government departments. If you think its a scam, dont respond. Use the phone book or an online search to check the organisations contact details. Never use the contact details provided in the original request. If you have provided personal identication information to scammers, contact IDCARE on 1300 432 273. Online scams: Scammers lurk within the anonymous environment of the internet. Email is a favoured scam delivery method, providing a cheap and straightforward way to communicate on a large scale. Phishing emails that sh for your personal information is the most common email scam type. Social networking platforms, dating sites and online forums allow scammers to befriend you and enter into your personal life to access your personal details, which can then be used against you or your family and friends. Online shopping, classieds and auction sites are used by scammers to target buyers and sellers, with initial contact often made through reputable and trusted sites or fake websites that look like the real thing. Look for secure payment options and beware of unusual payment methods such as wire transfer, Bitcoins or pre-loaded money cards. Credit cards usually offer some protection. Ransomware: What does ransomware do? Ransomware hijacks ur data. To free it, you need to pay a ransom. Hackers tell u to go somewhere to buy iTunes, Western Union fund transfer that cant be traced. What is an example of a social media or text message scam?Hi, I just found some funny photos of us. Click here: When you clicked the link from pretend friend."" The software or website will ask u for information to enter your personal or bank details. The next day, your money is gone. Or when you go to the site, it auto-installs a key logger on your device to record your bank website login details. When you ask your friend about the message, he will say he didnt send it. Friend will tell untruths or not that his computer has been hacked and all contacts have been taken. Internet Extortion Scam &gt; These are Internet love scams where Internet users are propositioned by online perpetrators whom they befriended through online dating or social networking sites.

The criminals mislead the victim with his false promise of transferring a large sum of money to her. The victim would be instructed to remit payment to a bank account before the promised amount can be transferred to her. After the victim has paid the money, the culprit would cease contact. In other cases, the perpetrators may claim to be in financial difficulty and request for help. Criminals may also claim to be detained by the authorities and demand for financial assistance. Members of the public are advised to adopt the following crime prevention measures: &gt; Be wary of messages from strangers who want to befriend you. &gt; Do not remit or transfer money to people whom you do not know well enough.

Please, can you do this? I really want to see you, once were together things will be perfect!!!!""This is a romance scam. Heres how you can tell: You meet someone online, who professes strong feelings for you after only a few contacts. The scammer will often reference information on your profile, claiming to have similar interests. They can also use a variety of tricks to make them seem more trustworthy  for example, pretending that they are a friend of a friend. Scammers may send photos, emails and call you on the phone. They often wait for weeks, months, or even years to gain your trust. Eventually, they tell you an elaborate story and ask for money, gifts or bank/credit card details. Protect yourself. Confirm their identity. Do an image search of your admirer to determine if they really are who they say they are. You can use image search services, such as Google or TinEye. Refuse requests for money. Never send money or give credit card details, online account details, or copies of important personal documents to anyone you dont know or trust. Limit the personal information you share. Scammers may use your information to create a fake identity. You should also be very cautious when sharing personal pictures or videos with prospective partners, especially if youve never met them before.

I'd love to show you around the place, but unfortunately, I'm currently overseas. As you can imagine, we're getting a lot of interest in the property. If you'd like to secure it. I'll need you to pay your bond and first month's rent upfront via an online money transfer ($3,100 total), and then I'll get the process started. I've attached my account details and some more beautiful images Of the property.  Thanks, Michelle Smith This is a rental scam. Heres how you can tell: Scammers advertise rental properties on well-known property websites. When you express interest, they say they are overseas or interstate and that you must conduct the transaction online. The scammers may try to appear genuine by providing photos, real addresses of properties, land title deeds and even scans of stolen passports. They scam you by asking for an up-front payment to secure the property. If you pay by money transfer, there is very little chance of recovering your money. Protect yourself. Have you inspected the property? Inspect the property in person before sending any money. Is the owner evasive? If the owner offers ongoing excuses about why you cannot view the property in person - such as them being away overseas  be wary. Avoid paying via money transfer. Payments made by money transfers are often impossible to recover. You should be very suspicious when this is the only method of payment available. Know what you are signing up (the fine print) for in newsletters, tick boxes and competitions - give a separate non-personal phone number and email dedicated to newsletters and competition ONLY.

Visit the website with HTTPS only. Don't let anyone, tell your family not to insert USB drives into your laptop. If you own a website domain, pay a few dollars a year to privatise your personal information as anyone who runs a whois query can find out your personal details. Don't download web browser add ons or extensions. Don't click on website advertisements. Log out of the website when you are done. Don't use your friend's computer to do your online banking or other stuff. Do your own things on your own computer only. Use one browser for personal entertainment activities, use one browser for online banking if you cannot afford a separate computer, tablet or phone. Never use public WiFi. Only visit secure sites: check for the padlock and 'https' in the address bar. Regularly delete your browsing history, cookies, and cache. If you want to test whether the Virtual Private Network app or provider works, fly to a country (or call someone your trust that lives overseas that restrict certain websites) &gt; log into the Hotel WiFi &gt; activate the VPN app &gt; see if you can access restricted websites.

Yet criminals who think that they are anonymous ( are actually not anonymous to the people who are after them ) post incriminating contents on the dark net. In a sense, isn't dark net a place to mine secrets to catch criminals to put up names for others to get promoted? Average users are on the open web. You just need an HTML5 compliant browser to get access to it. Even older browsers will work to access the internet. It's the successor to gopher compliant Netsites, and before that BBS and ARPANET. The deep net requires some kind of credentials and/or authorisation to browse around. [Facebook.com](URL is on the open net as the root Netsite [facebook.com/](URL a slash is indicative of root level in \*nix and most other operating systems (including windows). Dark Net content may also be password protected or otherwise encrypted, or even hidden/forbidden content. The dark net is what's hidden on the onion router, which is actually a Net of interconnected computers that are provided by the browser Tor when you log in to it. It's an intranet that sits on top of the existing internet that while expansive is really no different to your internal intranet for your school/business in a lot of ways other than how you connect to it. Anything can be on the dark net from illegitimate to legitimate and a grey area content in between. Links are called onions... It's quite hard to get around, links are often unreliable, and searches may not bring up legitimate content. It's the best advice and practice to stay away from the dark net. Some secrets end up there from time to time, including the report from the selection process for Australia's next-generation submarines that randomly popped up on the dark net a few years ago now. You can get around safely on the dark net if you are adamant about it, just use a VPN that also supports TOR, and you should be relatively safe from leaving any footprints. I still wouldn't advocate visiting it because there are a lot of things on there that are illegal or if not unlawful, you just plain would not want to see... The dark net has no real moral purpose, it just is, it's just there... Tor itself is not a VPN, a lot of people have foolishly thought that Tor will protect them by itself. While it's harder to find people, onions have been compromised before, and people have been exposed. If you want more privacy, you need a VPN. You can use Tor to access the clear net, but it's notorious for being painfully slow even with a fast cable or VDSL connection. My interpretation of its dark net is an offshoot to appear everyone is safe. But if you put it on the internet (reliable or otherwise) your joining the rest anyway. Tor is an example. Load a browser with privacy add-ons from developers you don't may not even know/or trust, and people will change their attitude. If by ""entrap"" you mean baiting with honeypots....its an ancient IT tradition that still has its purposes ...see Wikipedia for more info. Yes, there are plenty of honeypot operations on the dark net, there are also raids and stings. As I said above the dark net is not impenetrable, onions have been compromised by the FBI, CIA, Interpol, FIVEYES operations whoever, whatever... That's not without just compromising forum/groups/pages on the dark net and bringing down an entire ring/crime gang, whatever it is related to whether it's The Silk Road or pedo rings... It is nowhere safe on the internet, a VPN can do a pretty good job of hiding your IP, but humans are fallible and having your IP isn't the be-all and all. Social engineering can often uncover traits about human beings and their behaviours and then it doesn't matter how many proxies you're hiding behind... Social engineering and honeypot operations are some of the oldest tricks in the book, they're simple enough a teenager could understand how to use them, and they still work because the very nature of the human condition is fallibility no matter how perfect you try to be. There are already over 30 versions of Tor. Some work for particular regions, some work for all regions. And then you have the private dark net, which is not searchable at all. Either you have a link to some content, or you don't. That's the best way for authorities to catch out criminal activity because you need to garner a link from person-to-person communication. And as I have to keep mentioning to people, a VPN will not protect you and keep you anonymous. Authorities can track bespoke ('magic') packets to your house. Remember, folks, encryption is all just mathematics. Certain law enforcement agencies can know how a bespoke packet looks after encryption and can track it across the world to your home address (and then your personal details obtained from your ISP, for prosecution). There are already over 30 versions of Tor. Some work for particular regions, some work for all regions. Of course, there are Talis just being another popular one. A VPN will not protect you and keep you anonymous. No, it won't it just makes it a little more complicated, it also creates other complexities though. When ASIS, ASIO or the AFP ask for a warrant to access your data from some company in Russia you've been using as a proxy... You think that they're going to comply? You know, just roll over and say here, have all our data? There are a lot of companies on the record out there who are on the record as being entirely non-compliant when it comes to handing over access to data. It's up to you to choose wisely. And even if they get your data, what the hell do you think they're going to do with it, especially if it's encrypted... Add the standard encryption that a company like Apple offers to you should you choose it, and it's pretty much a case of seeing you in the next million years... Like I said, security is a game of cat and mouse... Neither the authorities or those who break the law are really winning, it's just about trying to stay one step ahead and aware of what's going on.

Better yet a secret concrete hole in the floor for the tower where the cables to the monitor, keyboard and mouse are wired only from the tower under the floor, out the wall to your monitor, keyboard and mouse. The internet is LAN cable to tower; thus, there's no wireless. The 100% way to keep you and your family safe is to eliminate the source of hacks, the mediums and/or the rewards. Thus if you only use cash, no online banking platform for your bank accounts, no debit/credit cards, eliminate social media, no digital life, do not take notes and photos that are stored in the cloud, it will reduce your risk by 50% as there are no confidential data, personal information and no money for criminals to take as it doesn't exist on your devices in the first place.

E.g. only Australia I.P. can log in. Thus if, e.g. u r residing in Japan &amp; u likely have enemies in Asia thus u can change ur password manager to only allow login from 1 other country except for Asia - Then you can use virtual private network apps to change ur I.P. address to the same country as your password manager to log in. This will enhance security on top of creating only 1 email account with two-factor authentication &amp; backup codes on paper dedicated to the password manager. In essence, the above no one knows about. You would likely have made enemies, e.g. in Japan or Asia thus use LastPass to set ur two-factor authenticator to allow login via other countries, e.g. the USA outside Asia by using the Private VPN app on ur laptop &amp; Phone to connect via USA I.P. address Lastpass, when u view password in a password manager, is light grey so its harder for people behind u to peep at ur password.

Thus use ur phone 5G mobile network to do ur work like web browsing bar watching internet videos and on a separate dirty device to watch heavy internet bandwidth things like videos using home WiFi. If there is a typo in an app, it is dodgy and is collecting ur personal information to hack u later on. Delete ur personal details, log out, delete the app account. Change ur personal details password and delete the app. Print Physical Passwords from Password Manager as a backup.

Windows 10 inbuilt free clipboard manager keeps ur data more secured on its enterprise security-grade servers compared to third-party apps #cybersecurityMore Business Websites Hit by Credit-card Skimming MalwareIn the last few days it has come to light that blender manufacturer NutriBullet and guitar tuition website Truefire fell foul of hackers who planted Magecart-style malicious code on their sites which went undetected for months, stealing the credit card details and personal information from users. Truefire realised it had suffered a security breach on January 10, 2020, and an investigation found that its website had been compromised since August 3, 2019. Sensitive data related to guitar-playing pupils and their payment cards continued to be skimmed as it was entered onto the compromised website for a further four days. Affected Truefire customers are only receiving a letter notifying them of the security breach now. Users were directed to major credit-monitoring companies and advised to keep a close eye on their finances for unusual transactions. Disappointingly, there does not appear to be any mention of the incident on Truefire's website. Meanwhile, as TechCrunch reports, security researchers at RiskIQ discovered that the site of blender maker NutriBullet had been compromised in similar attacks over the past two months. A malicious script planted on the NutriBullet website's payment page stole credit card numbers, expiry dates, CVV codes, names, and addresses of unsuspecting blender buyers and sent it to a server under the control of cybercriminals. According to the report, the sensitive data was then sold to other criminals on underground forums.RiskIQ says that although NutriBullet has attempted to clean up the poisoned webpages, the attackers continue to break back in and plant malicious code - suggesting that the attackers continue to exploit a way of compromising the blender maker's infrastructure. Peter Huh, the CIO of NutriBullet, confirmed that a security breach had occurred and said that a forensic investigation into the incident had been initiated. There is no word yet as to what plans NutriBullet has to inform affected customers. In both cases it feels like the companies at the centre of the security breaches should be responding more transparently with their users, ensuring that they are informed promptly and given as much detail as possible about what has [occurred. Organisations](URL which fail to communicate clearly and openly with their clients after a security breach risk doing serious harm to their reputation, and destroying any hard-earned trust they have built up with their customers over the years. The attacks on NutriBullet and Truefire are, I'm afraid, only the tip of the iceberg. Just last week, security researcher Jacob Pimental warned of 60 e-commerce sites that had been recently found to have fallen foul of Magecart.In a typical data breach, hackers break into company servers, access databases and steal large amounts of information  perhaps including encrypted passwords, email addresses, telephone numbers, and maybe even limited financial details. What you dont usually see in a data breach, however, is full payment card information stolen -  such as your CVV security code - because most companies simply do not store such details. That's what makes Magecart so dangerous. Magecart's malicious Javascript skims credit card details and personal information as it is entered by users on [websites. Companies](URL whose customers have been impacted by past Magecart attacks, including Ticketmaster, British Airways, Feedify, Umbro, Vision Direct, Newegg, Sweaty Betty, SHEIN, the American Cancer Society and many many more. While the attacks continue to successfully steal users' sensitive and easily-monetised data via company websites, there is no prospect of the criminals behind them stopping any time soon."

What resources can you learn more about the latest local scams? * Watch current affairs news segment. * Visit website that watches scams (google it) * Subscribe to scam watch newsletters to get the latest scam that is going around details. * Talk to people and your family and friends. **The golden rules to protect yourself** Generally, the hardest way is the way to make the most money. Don't fall for getting lots of money quick schemes. You will find yourself homeless very soon. Be alert to the fact that scams exist. When dealing with uninvited contacts from people or businesses, whether its over the phone, by mail, email, in person or on a social networking site, always consider the possibility that the approach may be a scam. Remember, if it looks too good to be true, it probably is. Know who youre dealing with. If youve only ever met someone online or are unsure of the legitimacy of a business, take some time to do a bit more research. Do a Google image search on photos or search the internet for others who may have had dealings with them. Keep your personal details secure. Put a lock on your mailbox and shred your bills and other important documents before throwing them out. Keep your passwords and pin numbers in a safe place. Be very careful about how much personal information you share on social media sites. Scammers can use your information and pictures to create a fake identity or to target you with a scam. Beware of unusual payment methods. Scammers often ask for payment by wire transfers, preloaded cards and even Google Play, Steam, or iTunes cards and Bitcoin. These are nearly always a sign that it is part of a scam. **Protect yourself** A tiny minority of business advertisements and flyers are a way for criminals to entrap victims. Go to the police for an official police check document for employment. There are scammers and dodgy companies that do invalid police checks. If someone calls you to offer you a good telecom deal and want your pin number, you should hang up. If you are unsure, contact the Police non-emergency hotline or contact the authority hotline after googling yourself. **Home scams:** Recent scams for older adults to be aware of are:  door knocks from people claiming to be officers from Council offering services such as home care packages; and  phone calls from people claiming to be from organisations that offer home care packages and services with cheaper costs. It is important to remember that the Council do not randomly knock on peoples doors offering to sell services. Council officers will only show up at a pre-arranged time to provide home care services, such as cleaning and personal care. Council officers carry ID badges and will produce them on request. If you are unsure, contact the council's service centre by phone to check that the person is employed by the Council and ask to speak to their supervisor. All home care packages and services are accessed through My Aged Care. If you do get a call, tell them you will think about the offer and phone the My Aged Care contact centre. The staff at My Aged Care can tell you if the organisation is a registered provider and give you the correct phone number to call and discuss. Chances are the person does not work for the organisation, or the organisation doesn't exist. As the weather warms up, scammers and conmen are out again with offers to fix your roof for a low price - but only if you pay now. Always ask them to give you a quote and get another quote from a trusted source - there is an excellent chance nothing is wrong with your roof. If the scammer/conmen insist on you paying now and offer to drive you to an ATM or bank, alarm bells should ring. Points to remember: \&gt; Never use a phone number or other contact details they have given you, check with someone you trust as there is a good possibility the contact details are to another conman ready to take the call; \&gt; Never pay with vouchers such as iTunes purchased at the supermarket; and \&gt; If you feel threatened and go to the bank with them, tell the bank teller you are feeling threatened and being forced to take the money out. They have been trained in how to assist you. 1. A fake tradesman asks you if you want to get some painting done cheaper than you can get anywhere else. * Then the rain comes, and it washes out into the garden. * How do fake tradesman deal with your roof? * They lure you by saying you are too old to climb up the ladder. They go up pretend to fix stuff. Stomp around and crack more tiles * They usually ask for cash up front, then say need to go to the hardware store to get supplies, disappear. * They offer you a pressure deal that for today only you get this deal at $x then they run away with the money. **Revealing sensitive information over the phone** Identity thieves love to dupe individualsparticularly ones that are elderly and vulnerableinto revealing their information by pretending to be from their bank or insurance company. They will try to get information by offering fake deals, like credit card cashback offers or free tripsso if you ever get a phone call about a deal that sounds too good to be true, that's because it is. When in doubt, call your credit card provider or bank directly to verify the offer is actually from them before revealing any information about yourselfor better yet, just don't pick up from unknown numbers at all. Instead, wait until they've left a message and then Google the number to see if it's legit. **Using SMS for two-factor authentication** ""Using SMS as two-factor authentication is not recommended,"" says Rodriguez. Why? Well, according to the tech expert, SMSthe technology used for text messagesis relatively easy to hack. So it's always safer to use a more secure app like Google Authenticator or Authy, than merely having potentially-sensitive information sent via text. **Not picking up your mail regularly** Opening someone else's letter might be a crime, but that's not stopping scammers from doing it anyway. Correspondence from your bank, credit card company or the IRS could have everything from account numbers to your social security number on it, making it easy for scammers to steal your identity. **Responding to suspicious sweepstakes** That pop-up message claiming that you just won a free cruise to the Bahamas is almost certainly a ploy by a scammer to get money and information out of you. According to the FTC, you can usually tell whether a sweepstake is a scam when you have to pay to enter or deposit the check you've won and then wire some of the money back. **Throwing private information in the trash** Scammers often obtain your personal data ""through discarded personal documents such as utility bills, insurance renewals, or health care records,"" the ACCC warns. Before discarding sensitive documents, first run them through a shredder. If you don't have one, make sure to rip and destroy all of your papers until the information on them is no longer legible, or get a text-obscuring rolling stamp to cover it up. **The top scams to avoid** Everyone is vulnerable to scams, so everyone needs information about how to identify and avoid being scammed. Some people think that only the gullible and greedy fall victim to scams. The truth is scammers are intelligent, and if you dont know what to look out for, anyone can fall victim to a scam. Have you received an offer that seems too good to be true, perhaps a phone call to help x your computer or a threat to pay the money you do not owe, an alert from your bank or telecommunications provider about a problem with your account or even an invitation to befriend or connect online? Scammers know how to press your buttons to get what they want. They are getting smarter, moving with the times to take advantage of new technology, new products or services and major events to create believable stories that will convince you to part with your money or personal details. However, thanks to the tens of thousands of scam reports received every year, the ACCC has prepared a list of common scams to reveal **Threat and penalty scams** If a government authority or trusted company is telling you to pay up, stop, think and double-check. **How the scam works** Instead of offering a prize, money or rebate, these scams use threats designed to frighten you into handing over your money. The scammer may call you and threaten you with arrest or send you an email claiming you owe money for a speeding ne, a tax office debt or an unpaid bill. During the phone call, scammers will pressure you into paying immediately and tell you the police will be sent to your house if you refuse. Scammers have been known to target vulnerable people in our community, such as newly arrived migrants. They pretend to be Immigration Department officials and threaten victims with deportation unless fees are paid to correct errors in their visas. A very similar scam involves the scammer pretending to be from the Australian Tax Office telling their victims they have an outstanding tax bill. Scammers also pretend to be trusted companies such as your bank, gas, electricity, water or phone provider. They will threaten to cancel your service or charge you excessive penalty fees if you dont pay the bill immediately. Sometimes they may impersonate a business like Australia Post stating you have an item to pick up or you will be charged a holding fee every day you dont pay. Whatever the case, they try to make you worried and act without stopping to think and check that the story is true. If the scam is sent by email, it is likely to include an attachment or link to a fake website where you will be asked to download proof of the bill, ne or delivery details. Opening the attachment or downloading the le will result in infecting your computer with malware (see page 16). Protect yourself  Dont be pressured by a threatening caller. Stop, think and check whether their story is true.  A government agency or trusted company will never ask you to pay by unusual methods such as by gift card, wire transfers or Bitcoins.  Verify the identity of the contact by calling the relevant organisation directlyfind them through an independent source such as a phone book, past bill or online search.  Do not use the contact details provided in emails or given to you during phone calls. Again, find them through an independent source. **Unexpected money scams** If you are asked to provide payments before receiving goods or money, think twice. How the scam works Scammers tell you out of the blue that you are entitled to money, precious gems, gold or valuable shares, but you need to make upfront payments to get them. You will never receive what was promised, and there will always be an excuse for why you have to pay more. If you pay the fees, you will lose your money. Rebate or reclaim scams involve a scammer telling you that you are owed money for reasons such as overpaid taxes, bank fees or some sort of compensation. However, before you can get your money, you are asked to pay a small administration fee. With inheritance scams, scammers pose as lawyers, bankers or foreign officials and tell you that you are entitled to a large inheritance or offer you a share in a scheme because you have the same name as someone who died. They often use official-looking documents and ask you to make payments for fees and taxes before you can receive the inheritance. They can also ask for your personal details to ll out official paperwork. This means that you might have your identity stolen as well as your money. Commonly called Nigerian scams may have originated in West Africa but can come from anywhere in the world. They involve scammers telling you they need your help to secure a vast fortune which they are desperately trying to transfer out of their country. They may claim the estate is a hidden stash of money, gold or assets abandoned by a corrupt government or official and if you agree to receive it, they will give you a large share when it is safe to do so. Like all of these scams, they will say you rst need to pay taxes, bank charges or fees for anti-terrorism and money laundering checks before they can send the money. These scams commonly come from overseas and ask for payment via wire transfer but may also ask for bank transfers or other payment methods. If you fall for these scams, you will never receive anything from the scammer and lose any money you sent. Protect yourself  Remember there are no get-rich-quick schemes: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.  Avoid any arrangement with a stranger that asks for up-front payment via money order, wire transfer, international funds transfer, pre-loaded card or electronic currency. It is rare to recover money sent this way.  If an unsolicited email looks suspicious, just delete it. Dont click on any links.  Government departments, banks or utilities will never contact you asking you to pay money upfront to claim a fee or rebate.  If you are unsure, check the identity of the contact independently. Do not use the contact details provided in the message sent to youget correct contact details through an independent source such as a phone book or online search.  Conduct a search online using the exact wording of the offer many scams can be identified this way. **Prize and lottery scams** Dont be lured by a surprise win only the scammer takes home a windfall. How the scam works These scams try to trick you into giving money upfront or your personal details to receive a prize from a lottery, sweepstake or competition that you never entered. Scammers claim that you need to pay fees or taxes before your winnings or reward can be released. You may also have to call or send a text to a premium rate phone number to claim your prize. Scratchie scams involve getting mail containing glossy brochures and several scratchie cards, one of which will be a winner. To make it more believable, it will often be a second or third prize. When you call to claim your prize, the scammers will ask for fees or taxes to be paid before you can get your winnings. Lottery scams may use the names of real overseas lotteries to claim that youve won cash, even though you never entered into them. Scammers typically ask for fees or taxes to release the funds. They will also tell you they need your personal details to prove you are the correct winner but then use this information to steal your identity or money from your bank account. Fake vouchers and gift cards involve scammers sending you an email or text message or a social media message claiming you have won a gift card for a well-known retailer, but you need to provide some details before you can claim it. This is an attempt to get personal information which can be used for identity theft or to target you with another scam. Offers like these have also been known to deliver ransomware on your device. Travel prize scams involve scammers claiming youve won a free holiday or airfares. In fact, what youve actually won is the chance to buy accommodation or ight vouchers. These travel vouchers often have hidden fees and conditions or maybe fake and worthless. Similarly, scammers may offer you amazing discounted holiday packages that just dont exist. Protect yourself  Remember: you cannot win money in a lottery or competition unless you entered.  Contests and lotteries do not require you to pay a fee to collect winningsconduct a search online using the exact wording of the offer. It may help confirm that its a scam.  Think twice before calling or text messaging a phone number starting with 19they are charged at premium rates. **Job and employment scams** Significant incomeguaranteed? Unlikely! How the scam works Job and employment scams involve offers to work from home or set up and invest in a business opportunity. Scammers promise a job, high salary or substantial investment return following initial upfront payments. These payments may be for a business plan, training course, software, uniforms, security clearance, taxes or fees. If you pay the fee, you may not receive anything or not what you expected or were promised. Some job offers may be a cover for illegal money laundering activities, where you are asked to act as an accounts manager or personal assistant, receive payments into your bank account for a commission, and then pass the money on to a foreign company. Job scams are often promoted through spam email or advertisements in well-known classieds and on job seeker websiteseven government job seeker websites. A significant danger with these job scams is that you can be asked for a lot of personal details that you should not provide including your tax le number and copies of your passport or drivers licence. This information could be used later for identity theft. Protect yourself  Beware of offers or schemes claiming to guarantee income or requiring payment upfront.  Never agree to transfer money for someone elsethis is money laundering, and it is illegal.  Do not provide your tax file number, drivers licence or passport when applying for a job. You may need to provide this information but only after you have started work. Money laundering is a criminal offence: do not agree to transfer money for a stranger. **Charity and medical scams** Scammers are heartless and can strike during desperate times of need. How the scam works Scammers take advantage of people seeking to donate to a good cause or nd an answer to a health problem. Charity scams involve scammers collecting money by pretending to work for a legitimate cause or charity, or a ctitious one they have created. Often scammers will exploit a recent natural disaster or crisis that has been in the news. These scams divert much-needed donations away from legitimate charities. Charities must be registered with the governmentdonate condently by checking their registration rst. Miracle cure scams offer a range of products and services that can appear to be legitimate alternative medicines, usually promising quick and effective remedies for severe medical conditions. The treatments are often promoted using false testimonies from people who have been cured. Weight loss scams promise dramatic weight loss with little or no effort. This type of fraud may involve an unusual or restrictive diet, revolutionary exercise, a fat-busting device, breakthrough pills, patches or creams. You may be required to make a significant advance payment or enter into a long-term contract to receive ongoing supplies. Fake online pharmacies offer counterfeit drugs and medicine at low prices and sometimes provide them without a doctors prescription. These drugs may have limited or no active ingredients, which can have lethal consequences for users. Protect yourself  If you are approached by a charity street collector, ask to see their identification. If you have any doubts about who they are, do not pay.  Check the Australian Charities Not for Profit Associations list of registered charities.  Consult your healthcare professional if you are considering a miracle or instant-fix claim about medicines, supplements or other treatments.  Ask yourself: if this really is a miracle cure, wouldnt your healthcare professional have told you about it? **Business scams** Scammers take advantage of the busy nature of many businesses to swindle them. How the scam works Scams targeting businesses come in all sorts of guises and are likely to strike at the busiest times, like the end of the nancial year. A false billing scam is the most common trick scammers use against businesses. Scammers issue fake bills for unwanted or unauthorised listings, advertisements, products or services. The business directory scam is a well-known example, where you receive a bill for a listing in a supposedly well-known directory. Scammers trick you into signing up by disguising the offer as an outstanding invoice or a free listing, but with a hidden subscription agreement in the ne print. The domain name scam is another ploy used by scammers, where you are deceived into signing up for an unsolicited internet domain registration very similar to your own. You may also receive a fake renewal notice for your actual domain name and pay without realising. An office supply scam involves you receiving and being charged for products that you did not order. These scams often involve products or services that you regularly order, such as stationery and cleaning supplies. Scammers typically call your business pretending that a service or product has already been ordered. Payment redirection scams involve a scammer using information they have obtained by hacking your computer systems. They then pose as one of your regular suppliers and tell you that their banking details have changed. They may tell you they have recently changed banks and may use copied letterhead and branding to convince you they are legitimate. They will provide you with a new bank account number and ask that all future payments are processed accordingly. The scam is often only detected when your regular supplier asks why they have not been paid. Ransomware can be extremely damaging for any business. The best defence is to back up your data regularly and store your backups offsite and offline. Protect yourself  Dont agree to offers or deals straight awayalways ask for an offer in writing and seek independent advice if the agreement involves money, time or a long-term commitment.  Never provide your business banking, financial and accounting details to someone that contacts you unexpectedly and that you dont know and trust.  Effective management procedures can go a long way towards preventing scamshave clearly defined processes for verifying and paying accounts and invoices and look very carefully at requests to change banking details.  Train your staff to recognise scams.  Back up your business data offsite and offline.  Beware of emails requesting changes to payment details. Always verify changes to payment details directly with the business or individual. How scams workthe anatomy of a scam Most scams follow the same pattern, and once you understand this, the tricks of the scammer become easier to spot. If you look carefully at all of the different types of scams outlined in this book, youll soon notice that most scams go through three stages: (1) approach; (2) communication; and (3) payment. Understanding the essential parts of a scam will help you to avoid the current crop of scams and to be on guard against new scams that emerge in the future. 1. The approach: delivery method When scammers approach you, it will always come with a story designed to make you believe a lie. The scammer will pretend to be something they are not, a government official, an expert investor, a lottery official or even a romantic admirer. To deliver these lies to you, scammers will use a range of communication methods. **Over the phone scams** Scammers call and SMS too. Phone calls are made by scammers to homes and businesses in a wide variety of scams, from threatening tax scams to offers of prizes or help with computer viruses. The availability of cheap Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) telephone calls means call centres can operate offshore with telephone numbers that look like their local numbers. Telephone caller identication can easily be disguised and is one of the many tricks scammers use to make you believe they are someone else. SMS text messages are used by scammers to send a whole range of scams, including competition or prize scams. If you respond, you may be charged at premium rates or nd yourself signed up to a subscription service. It is safer not to respond or click on links in text messages unless you know who they came from. They can also contain attachments or links to malicious software in the guise of photos, songs, games or apps. Scams - Part 2"

Cybercriminal hacked = victim cut big sized data, the hacker made data loss (disappeared/corrupted), so the victim cannot paste data. Windows 10 inbuilt free clipboard manager keeps your data more secured on its enterprise security-grade servers compared to third-party apps #cybersecurity **More Business Websites Hit by Credit-card Skimming Malware** In the last few days, it has come to light that blender manufacturer NutriBullet and guitar tuition website Truefire fell foul of hackers who planted Magecart-style malicious code on their sites which went undetected for months, stealing the credit card details and personal information from users. Truefire realised it had suffered a security breach on January 10, 2020, and an investigation found that its website had been compromised since August 3, 2019. Sensitive data related to guitar-playing pupils and their payment cards continued to be skimmed as it was entered onto the compromised website for a further four days. Affected Truefire customers are only receiving a letter notifying them of the security breach now. Users were directed to major credit-monitoring companies and advised to keep a close eye on their finances for unusual transactions. Disappointingly, there does not appear to be any mention of the incident on Truefire's website. Meanwhile, as TechCrunch reports, security researchers at RiskIQ discovered that the site of blender maker NutriBullet had been compromised in similar attacks over the past two months. A malicious script planted on the NutriBullet website's payment page stole credit card numbers, expiry dates, CVV codes, names, and addresses of unsuspecting blender buyers and sent it to a server under the control of cybercriminals. According to the report, the sensitive data was then sold to other criminals on underground forums.RiskIQ says that although NutriBullet has attempted to clean up the poisoned webpages, the attackers continue to break back in and plant malicious code - suggesting that the attackers continue to exploit a way of compromising the blender maker's infrastructure. Peter Huh, the CIO of NutriBullet, confirmed that a security breach had occurred and said that a forensic investigation into the incident had been initiated. There is no word yet as to what plans NutriBullet has to inform affected customers. In both cases it feels like the companies at the centre of the security breaches should be responding more transparently with their users, ensuring that they are informed promptly and given as much detail as possible about what has occurred. Organisations which fail to communicate clearly and openly with their clients after a security breach risk doing serious harm to their reputation, and destroying any hard-earned trust they have built up with their customers over the years. The attacks on NutriBullet and Truefire are, I'm afraid, only the tip of the iceberg. Just last week, security researcher Jacob Pimental warned of 60 e-commerce sites that had been recently found to have fallen foul of Magecart.In a typical data breach, hackers break into company servers, access databases and steal large amounts of information  perhaps including encrypted passwords, email addresses, telephone numbers, and maybe even limited financial details. What you dont usually see in a data breach, however, is full payment card information stolen -  such as your CVV security code - because most companies simply do not store such details. That's what makes Magecart so dangerous. Magecart's malicious Javascript skims credit card details and personal information as it is entered by users on websites. Companies whose customers have been impacted by past Magecart attacks, including Ticketmaster, British Airways, Feedify, Umbro, Vision Direct, Newegg, Sweaty Betty, SHEIN, the American Cancer Society and many many more. While the attacks continue to successfully steal users' sensitive and easily-monetised data via company websites, there is no prospect of the criminals behind them stopping any time soon."
