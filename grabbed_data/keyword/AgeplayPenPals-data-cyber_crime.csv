No players under 18, please. Thanks.\*\** \**\*Note: I won't always be 'In The Mood' to play all my stories. Suggest a list of your favorites.\*\** # About Me Hey, there my name is **Master of Perversions** or **Perversions** for short. I am a long-time roleplayer who has been writing erotic stories for nearly 20+ years now, so needless to say I am experienced and have lots of lewd ideas. If you want some more personal info on me. I am a 33 California native, I am over six feet tall, I am in good shape (go to the gym, run, soccer, rock-climb), and I am progressive meaning I respect women but I also am very dominant in the bedroom. I am a pretty open book willing to share about myself and I hope to meet partners who feel the same. # Requirements So now you know about me and you want to grab my attention? There are some elements I think make female players stand out above their peers and keep me interested. If you check off all (or most) of the items on this list than you will have me very interested. * **Creative/Geeky/Perverted Female** \- The three cornerstones of a perfect female player. She should be creative enough to run with ideas, geeky enough to lots of canon she can draw inspiration from and perverted enough to get behind my lewd kinks. * **Playing on Discord** \- I pretty much play exclusively on Discord now. With the private servers, easy image sharing, and being able to edit a post after its sent. It's easily THE BEST application for roleplay. Reddit is good for initial PM only. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female? That won't cut it for me. If your trans? You can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling a connection or not. Gender, Orientation, and Sexuality is complex. I won't ask you to conform to my sexuality and you shouldn't force me to conform to yours. * **Switch or Submissive** \- I don't mind rolling in bed with a woman who likes to take control but I like to be the dom in the bedroom. I am not saying NO to dominant woman, just understand my goal is to make you mine. * **Flexible Age Range** \- Stories often have a variety of characters differing in age, expect to have underage characters in these stories. If you have issues with ageplay we can make them NPC style characters who are present but don't get involved in sex. The more flexible your age range are the better your chances. * **Multiple Characters** \- The stories I write are... complex. I often take on a DM/GM role writing the world with multiple characters (I won't say no to a female DM/GMing for me). If you are a player who can ONLY write one character, I mean no offense but your skill level isn't high enough to play in these sort of plots. * **Open Book Players** \- I want to get to know you. I will ask you A/S/L, your first name and some other personal questions about who you are. That said, **I** **WILL NEVER** ask for your phone number, personal email, where you work, or your last name. There are details that can be shared that preserve your anonymity online and others that compromise it. I aim to protect you (and myself) asking things that won't give away who you truly are. Unless we reach that level of trust and respect and decide to get closer. * **Quantity and Quality** \- Writing a quality post can be difficult. There are various elements that can undermine a post. Repeating what I said in your post, not adding anything new to the scene, god-modding characters (AKA Mary Suing), one-liner responses, and the list goes on. I am willing to invest time and effort into playing with you, I don't think its unfair to ask you to do the same with me. * **Hard No Kinks** \- I will NOT humor ANY of these kinks, I wont shame you but having these any where in your prompt history will discourage me from playing with you: Diapers/Infantilism, Snuff, Mutilation/Nullification, Gore, Obese/Fat/Hyper Fat, Vomiting, Gas/Farting, Blood, Scat, STD's, Popping, Prolapsing, and Toilet Play. If a kink relates to this list then I probably don't want to involve it. # Original Stories **Body Shifters** \- The Body Shifters are a 'female' alien species that live for/crave/eat cum in order to stay healthy. They can alter their bodies at will changing size, shape, color, and clothes at a thought. They are loyal to their human lovers who they feed off of by fucking/sucking all day long. Our story will follow one of these lucky males who gets hooked up with one of these alien babes and trying to keep her a secret while his life becomes one of sex and keeping his alien girls happy. Oh did I mention the more you feed them that they eventually get so big that they split into two new girls? Yeah... that happens. &amp;#x200B; **Castaways** \- A simple plot of either crash landing or being shipwrecked on a deserted island (or planet if Scifi setting). I always liked the concept of being alone and working hard to survive. Of course, as an erotic roleplay a guy on an island by himself jerking off is pretty boring, so we are gonna have some girls wash up on that island with him! What will they find on the island? Who knows. Could be amazon tribe, a lost fertility goddess, the fountain of youth, human-sized venus fly taps with tentacles, or mind/body altering plants that make us into animals. The possibilities are endless but the premises is always the same. &amp;#x200B; **Dawn of the Breasts** \- Its basically a zombie story only instead of rotting corpses ravaging people, the infected are naked horny and feral bimbos/himbos. No killing needed for this plot all it takes is some cum, breast milk or saliva to start someone's inevitable fall to this very sexy disease. Transformation plays a big role here where people take a load and start to put on hyper fertile curves before chasing down their friends and family to turn them as well. There are lots of places to start a story like which makes it highly erotic and versatile. &amp;#x200B; **Dirty Politics** \- A recent idea I been playing with is exploring someone's rise to power in the modern political age. He can either be a brilliant politician or have mind control abilities allowing him to get what he needs/wants to be done quickly. Politically speaking his ideas are often for the best of society and does right by the people but behind closed doors, he will make his opponents daughters his own personal sluts to spy on their fathers and help him build an empire of influence under his enemies noses. We may even use famous politicians to do it. &amp;#x200B; **Fertile Valley** \- If you read erotica on the web then you likely came across Fertile Valley. While not every aspect of the original story turned me on the concept of a small secluded town affected by their tainted water supply was something that stuck with me. I am looking for an imagining of this plot with a federal agent moving to the town to find out what the fuck is going on only to have the effects start to alter him and his family. The question is will he stop it before he is too far gone or will he give in to the pleasure and embrace the communities incestuous culture? Only one way to find out. &amp;#x200B; **La Resistance** \- A story for all you history lovers out there who love period pieces. La Resistance follows the French Resistance in Paris during WW2. The general plot of the story follows a OSS Operative from the US sent into France to help establish the resistance and help them defeat the Nazis. The team he builds will be mostly (if not all) female operatives from various walks of life. I have some characters already created and while French girl is the largest group we also have German, English, Irish, Russian, and American girls among the list of playable characters. If this interests you let me know and I can share what I have written so far. &amp;#x200B; **Man With All The Gifts** \- A relatively generic plot considering all the other stories on the list. I bachelor, father, divorced dad, and/or teacher is given a new lot in life be in magic, miracle pill, alien ray gun, or body altering nanites or whatever. Whatever starts the changes it will allow him to become more over time and eventually make him a demi-god among men. Naturally, as any demi-god would do, he starts to claim the women of his life! Coworkers, old girlfriends, ex-wife, daughters, daughters friends, neighbors and so on. It's really a male power fantasy but I find a fair amount of female players wanting to be claimed by a true alpha. An there aren't any bigger alphas than him! &amp;#x200B; **I Love Puazi** \- The Puazi are an alien species who moved to earth to cohabitate with humanity. That's the general setting in a nutshell. The fun part about the Puazi is their biology makes them really into the smells of earth mammals, primarily humans. The musk makes them sway on their feet, go cross-eyed and crave that drug that is a human climax in their mouth. If you don't know the Puazi, I would suggest googling Puazi Incase and getting to know the source material! I promise its worth the read of those lewd comics. &amp;#x200B; **Only We Remain** \- If you get to know me, you will find that I have a deep affection for zombie plots. The scavenging, rebuilding, survival, and fighting create a very compelling plot. Only We Remain (Parodyish title of the Last of Us) follows an alien spore that starts converting men into undead monsters. It's harder to elaborate on then other stories as I have infected types, locations, survivor groups, and the science of infection pretty clearly laid out. If you want a true zombie survival plot that is 2/3rds plots and 1/3rd sex? This is the best plot for you. &amp;#x200B; **Rise of the Wolves** \- Jay Naylor put out a comic called the Fall of Little Red Riding Hood which gave life to that old tale. The Wolves were a tribe and they discovered that humans were quite breedable and made wonderful fleshy lovers. In that vain, I plan to explore the source content more fully writing out a plot of how the Wolves begin to take human settlements and make humanity their literal bitches. Its a wonderful anthro on human storyline, it has lots of corruption and even transformation play involved. If you want to get fucked by literal big bad wolfs, this is a good plot for you. &amp;#x200B; **Supernatural Girlfriend AKA My Little Succubus** \- A general story I been working on is slice of life story with Succubus Girlfriend. As I continued to write this setting I started to think about other potential Super Natural Lovers. A Vampire Girlfriend who requires to feed on me from time to time and loves to watch movies all night, a Ghost Girlfriend who is around the time but is never really there, an Orc Girlfriend who is as strong as me and really loves sports but has a temper. Its clever collection of couples in a modern setting exploring how we 'click' as lovers. If you want to play multiple girlfriends I won't say no to such a story, I also have supernatural boyfriends encase you want to be a human female with her hung werewolf boyfriend or whatever. &amp;#x200B; **Wincestor House** \- Wincestor House is a basically a haunted mansion or manor that has sexualized ghosts who to fuck the family that moves in. This is easily my most incestuous plot on the list and has things like possession, phantom lovers, flashbacks to other lives, and living objects involved in the plot. I try not to make it a horror movie but nor do I want it to be boring or tame. Its somewhere between House on Haunted Hill, Crimson Peak, Poltergeist and pinch of Casper with a big scoop of porn. I have a primary plot focused on the occult and witchcraft connected to family sex but that plot isnt for everyone so ask me what other options I have if that's not your thing. &amp;#x200B; **Other Originals** \- I have dozens of other plots unposted. Alpha Formula - Chemical turns man into a half-man/half-wolf beast. Family Farm - A family is turned into beasts of burden on their own farm. Invasion of the Space Futa - Alien Amazons with Cocks invade earth. Master PC - Reality altering PC program changes people's reality with a few times. And the list goes on. If you have ideas of your own feel free to share, I might have a plot for that. # Canon Stories **The 13 Kingdoms**: *A Disney Story* \- The various Disney Girls reimagined in an interconnected world that plays a lot like with Lord of the Rings with a fair amount of strong female characters. I typically play ""The Big Bad Wolf"" in these stories as a former hero who was twisted by dark powers and now resides in a gray area where he is neither trusted by the Princesses or the Wicked Witches. We can discuss where you might like to take this plot. &amp;#x200B; **Apex**: *A Overwatch Story* \- A new villain called APEX emerges as a nanite infused human who seeks to get revenge on the members of Overwatch and steal their tech. There is no doubt he will enslave them making them into wanton sluts once he has their way with them. Certain characters hold high value like Tracers whos chest plate will allow APEX to distort time. The more he claims the more dangerous he becomes. Will Overwatch and Talon join forces to stop this new foe who seeks to rule the world? &amp;#x200B; **Big Bad Wolf:** *A Witcher Story* \- Geralt is one of the stronger male characters in the past 20 years. I would love to do a simple story with him hunting monsters and having various romantic encounters. If that doesn't scratch your itch he can be corrupted by a perverted mutagen or come down a case of the Werewolfs before breeding Yen, Triss, and Ciri. Please at least know the video games. &amp;#x200B; **Darkest Night**: *A Batman Story* \- Batman isn't terribly interesting but he is fit, smart, rich and in my stories hung. I like a good plot where he is corrupted by Ivy into her equal or an injection from Harley that makes him lose control. The how/why are flexible but what happens after is always the same. He starts to fuck the hell out of the women of Gotham and he takes the best ones back to Wayne Manor to be his harem of superwomen. &amp;#x200B; **Distant Corners:** *A Star Trek Story* \- I been super eager to meet a female Trekkie who wants to build and OC crew and explore the universe. This is nothing short of an undertaking and we need to be sure we click as players before investing the time and energy into populating a crew. If done right we will have a strong female crew getting into sexy adventures in no time! &amp;#x200B; **Emerging Reality**: *A Marvel/DC Story* \- I been exploring the merging of universes them with Marvel/DC coming together. I even added Overwatch, Lara Croft, Ben 10 and other settings to the same universe. The means changes from the Infinity Stones merging worlds or some other MacGuffin causing the realities to merge. My favorite character to play is Green Lantern and I have merged him once with Peter Parker making a new character. Super Flexible here with who the lead male can be and where we take the plot. &amp;#x200B; **Fang:** *A Miraculous Story* \- I watched this show with my niece and thought it is fun to write a story where a more dominant older character stepped in and fought crime with Lady Bug. I already settled with this character being a Wolf, about 30 something years old and dominating the fuck out of the schoolgirls in this setting. Expect a very different kind of Miraculous story if you undertake this with me. &amp;#x200B; **The Gray Jedi:** *The Star Wars Story* \- I don't always play Star Wars stories but when I do I am Gray Jedi Master who fucks his padawans. Really though most Star Wars plots are great, I prefer the Old Republic over any other setting. Multiple padawans are desired in this setting. OC characters are great. Canon women are more than welcome. &amp;#x200B; **The King of the North:** *A* *Game of Thrones* \- I do A LOT of retcons on Game of Thrones and 95% of them are saving a hot female from an untimely death. Moving beyond that I usually explore a plot where Jon Snow becomes a dominant stud and starts to build an empire in the North and in the wombs of any woman he sees fit. The means of corruption usually comes from Ygritte shooting some arrows into him only this time the arrows are poisoned and he gets changed by the experience. Does he get bigger and stronger? Just a massive cock? Maybe he turns into Wolf or Dragon? Who knows! Well I do but I mean what do you want from this story. &amp;#x200B; **Lord of Columbia**: *A Bioshock Story* \- Elizabeth from Bioshock might be one of my top 10 females from video games; Lara Croft, Sarah Kerrigan, and Tali'Zorah also make that list. What makes me want to put her on this list? Reality hopping. I love the idea of her teaming up with her Daddy (Booker) and helping him find other versions of her and making them his. It's perverted, incestuous and has themes of ageplay, harems, and breeding but I fucking love it. Even more so if he takes Rapture as well. This is pretty much for pervs who love Bioshock as much as me. &amp;#x200B; **Normandy Harem:** *Mass Effect Story* \- There are three avenues to make Shepard become 'evil'. Cerberus Nanites, Collector Parasites, or Reaper Indoctrination Device. I tend to prefer the first option but the result always leads him to fucking the women of the Normandy. Is this plot not your thing? I have ideas for Andromeda and a clone program that makes a bunch of female Shepards. &amp;#x200B; **Symbiote Chronicles**: *A Spider-man Story* \- I find Peter Parker, bit of a Gary Stu. I actually really enjoyed how human they made him in Enter the Spider-Verse. I am getting off track. Point is, I play a more human Spider-man. He's not smarter then Stark, he can't lift two tanks, and he cant shoot a web faster then hammer of a pistol after the trigger is pulled. I am off track again. Spider-Man. Sexual Deviant. Venom Symbiote. Lots of Sex. Mary Jane. Gwen Stacey. Snoo Snoo. You get the idea. &amp;#x200B; **Tongue of the Dragon:** *A Skyrim Story* \- A shelved story idea I been to fucking lazy to finish. Sexy Dragon Shouts. Is it possible? Actually yeah the vocab is there but I haven't spent the time to put together a list of perverted shouts. Shouts that would rip armor off a female warriors' body, make a person instantly more submissive or make them susceptible to mind control. It should be noted &amp;#x200B; **Vault Alpha:** *A Fallout Story* \- I have about 10 Vaults I made for the Fallout setting. Hands down my favorite is Vault Alpha also known as a cultural preservation vault. A girls school with a bunch of students from all over the world (including communist China) and their cultures knowledge saved with them. Of course, there was a boys school with same objective but they didn't survive (or did they?) but with the tunnel joining the vaults collapsed they won't find out anytime soon. Its a fun take on Fallout and one I love to explore. If that's not your thing guess what? I got more fucking fallout plots! &amp;#x200B; **Other Canon** \- Honestly the list of games, books, movies, shows, cartoons, anime, and comics goes on forever. Make a list of your favorites from those listed media mediums and present them in conversation. I will let you know which ones I know and are willing to play. I freely admit my anime/manga selection is limited to mostly what comes across Adult Swim. # Generic Stories **Angels &amp; Demons** \- Summoning an Incubus, Hell on Earth with angels and demons fighting for souls, a taboo coupling of angel and demon, and more. I love a good Heaven and Hell story. &amp;#x200B; **Cyber/Bio/Nanopunk** \- I tend to lean towards criminals, hackers, ex-military types, and noir style detectives. I always loved these setting where humanity has blurred the lines between man and machine and began to twist his DNA to suit his needs. &amp;#x200B; **CYOA** \- There are now lewd CYOA's that exist online. If you have something that gets you nice and wet feel free to share. I have a F-list profile dedicated to my collection. &amp;#x200B; **End of the World/Post Apoc** \- Gritty stories where the world has ended by drought, plague, radiation, virus or even the undead. While I would never wish this on humanity it does bring peoples character to the surface. Are you a Criminal? A Survivor? A reluctant hero? A submissive? The end of the world will let you know. &amp;#x200B; **Fantasy** \- Orcs, Centaurs, Elves, and Demons! Oh my! I personally love Conquest plots where kingdoms fall to invaders who take the spoils. Other stories like a demonic curse or princess in hiding also interest me. &amp;#x200B; **Fairy Tales** \- I love a good folk tale! We can keep it in the fantasy setting or shift it to a modern setting. Alternatively, I been exploring polytheistic gods in the same lense as Fairy Tales, so if you want to see stories about Zeus. Let me know. &amp;#x200B; **Furries** \- Oh god he rights furry stories as well? Yeah, I fucking do. I am a Big Bad Wolf who ruts foxes and bunnies wanna fight about it? &amp;#x200B; **Free Use World** \- A popular choice on Reddit where people are used freely in society for sexual purposes. I can get behind this sort of plot with the right people and in the right setting. Come with a good reason for society to become so sexually open. &amp;#x200B; **Holiday** \- Christmas, Halloween, Easter, Etc. I have a profile dedicated to Holiday stories on F-list. I am willing to indulge in the festivities here. If you wanna get fucked in a Halloween costume? I got you. Want to be wrapped in a big bow for Christmas? Of course. Wanna get dominated by an anthro easter bunny? I'm your man. &amp;#x200B; **Incest** \- I have a lewd soft spot for Brother/Sister and Father/Daughter plots myself. Not against Uncle/Niece or Son/Mother either. If a story has family members as characters, I am more than willing to explore those perverted couplings. &amp;#x200B; **Interracial** \- This is a tough one only because racism is still a real thing and I walk this fine line between playing interracial motivated scenes and some stereotypes. There are real bigots online who solely get off on racist scenes and cant separate a short fantasy from respecting and caring for other people in the real world. If you find yourself believe racist beliefs and taking that as you personal social/political view. I am not the man for you. &amp;#x200B; **Military/Spies** \- Gritty settings mostly set in the middle east these days. I enjoy the occasional boots on the ground story where soldiers let off steam while in a secluded base. I admit I added zombies to these military plots a few times. Spies are a little more different, located in the cities and focuses on the spycraft itself. &amp;#x200B; **Modern Fantasy** \- Magical wielders hidden in plain sight in the modern world. This includes Elves hiding their ears, vampires in a modern setting, men locking themselves in shipping containers under a full moon, or immortal gods running their own companies. The possibilities are endless. &amp;#x200B; **Monsters** \- I can play a werewolf, incubus, tentacle fiend, or whatever for your personal cravings. Monsters can be fun if done right and unlike most settings, it can be done fantasy, modern or sci-fi no problem. &amp;#x200B; **Slasher** \- Been kicking around the idea of a sexy slasher setting. Big scary 'killer' hunting teens-only instead of murdering them he fucks them senseless. Maybe they are fucked so hard they are knocked out for hours or start to like the slasher with that giant cock. I don't know. &amp;#x200B; **Space Opera** \- Space marines, derelict ship with aliens on-board, colonization missions, or just a ragtag crew taking on odd jobs. I love me a good space story! &amp;#x200B; **Steam/Diesel/Atom/Clockpunk** \- A fun setting that I mostly write with furry characters. The main reason why we love these settings? Personal skyships, fashion and a sense of adventure. Great backdrop for a lewd story. &amp;#x200B; **Super Heroes** \- We can either use canon heroes or make up our own heroes for some superpowered sex scenes. I usually play a Batman Esq hero myself but if you want me to fly and fuck you so hard we take down a building I am down. &amp;#x200B; **Supernatural** \- Be it the occult, witchcraft, demons, ancient books or artifacts or whatever. I have a Templar who's managed to survive hundreds of years as a potential champion for the story of our choosing. If you love the Supernatural we can expand on it together. &amp;#x200B; **Toons** \- We all love cartoons and I am more than willing to explore the hundreds of lovely characters given to us in Cartoons. We can write a story with the Power Puff Girls or we can have a plot where we live in a cartoon reality (Like Cool World) where physics are suggestions and the only way to kill a toon is with an eraser. &amp;#x200B; **Westerns** \- I found Westerns are pretty hard plots to get off the ground. When I have written plots like this it's mostly bounty hunting or building a homestead with a strong female and her son. I only have a few working ideas for this setting so meet me halfway on the brainstorming. &amp;#x200B; **Witches &amp; Warlocks** \- After watching that new Sabrina, witchcraft has been on my mind. If you want to explore a setting that explores Witchcraft be in our modern world or Hogwarts I am down. &amp;#x200B; **Other Settings** \- I probably missed some things like Tron, Gor, Robots, and historical periods. If you have something you like to feel free to suggest it. The worst-case scenario is me saying ""No Thanks"" and suggesting something else. Be creative and feel free to mix and match ideas like Cyberpunk and Zombies, sounds fucking awesome to me. # Top Kinks * **Ageplay** \- Loli's and Jailbait to Milfs and Dilfs. I like ageplay in my stories (depending on the plot) and so should you. It's not mandatory but if want to up your chances to play with me you need to be ok with this kink. * **Breeding/Pregnancy** \- Not sure when I developed this kink but I love the idea of knocking up my companions. Its the connection that it creates putting a baby in a fertile womb. I am down to explore this kink all the way up to birth, such scenes involving that should happen off-screen. * **Corruption** \- Just like Transformation but changing of the mind. I like moving the dial of character's morality and personality in a story. My favorite is a Lawful Good male becoming a Deviant Dominating Pervert. He doesn't need to be evil, he just needs to value sex over people. * **Domination** \- I like to be in control in most stories. Master/Slave, Daddy/Daughter, Alpha/Omega and so on. I don't mind stories that involve scenes where I am submissive but there is no chance I will do a plot where I remain that way. Where I don't turn the tables and take control of the woman who thought she was the mistress. * **Harem Play** \- Needless to say I am kind of greedy. I like plots where I claim multiple girls. If you think that's unfair, let me remind you I GM/DM 99% of my stories so the workload is more often then not on my shoulders. If you're willing to play a harem for me, you get to move to the front of the line. * **Incest** \- A family that plays together. Stays together. Incest is not a must but I love to have it appear in most plots. Improve your chances of playing by agreeing to exploring this kink. * **Interracial** \- I love a good mix of skin colors in the bedroom. I love the cultural differences and exploring how people fit. However, if you I think you are a real racist; MAGA hat-wearing Neo-Nazi Trump voter. You can go fuck yourself. * **Mind Control** \- Closely related to corruption. I love playing with mind control. It can be easy like swinging a gem in front of your face until your under a trance or it can be hard like me slowly reprogramming your mind by altering memories. I enjoy both fantastical snap your fingers mind control and the realistic subliminal music/image approach that takes effect over time. * **Transformation** \- There is something about getting bigger, thicker, stronger, or turning from man to beast that turns me on. I like it when it happens to me. I like it when it happens to you. Most of my stories have TF to varying degrees. # Closing So there you have it my long-winded post to catch quality female players like you. Reddit isn't a great space to hunt for female players if only because there are 10 to 1 male to female ratio and lesser males love to downvote other \[M4F\] posts above/below their own. If you have read this full post; Good Job, Gold Star! Shoot me a Message (Reddit chat is hot garbage), if we click well we will move this party to Discord where hopefully we will play for a very very long time. &amp;#x200B; Lewd Regards, **Master of Perversion** ^(P.S.

I am a long-time roleplayer who has been writing erotic stories for nearly 20+ years now (weird to say that out loud), so needless to say I am highly experienced and have lots of [lewd ideas](URL I am a 33 Dominant Male Californian; I am over six feet tall, I have muscular/athletic body type (Soccer, Gym, Rock Climbing, Biking), vivid green eyes framed by black glasses and progressive views on the world. I am an open book willing to share some personal details about myself with you (well most details) and I hope you're willing to do the same for me. I keep hitting the fucking character limit on Reddit which is making it hard for me to write all my lewd plots on this profile. So please consider this a tip of the iceberg of what I have to offer and if you have ideas feel free to share, there is a good chance I have character/plot/settings that will complement your work. # Top Desired Stories ^(\*\*Stories are organized alphabetically not in order of most to least desired. \*\*) **Around The World in 80 Lays** \- Based on the story Around the World In 80 Days. An academic goes on a grand adventure to prove his theory that all women are created equal. He sleeps with various cultures to prove his theory correct. I can explain the plot in more detail in chat. **Castaways** \- A deserted island which are characters wash upon. Is there an amazon tribe among the trees? A lost fertility goddess seeking to be rediscovered? The fountain of youth? Man-sized Venus flytraps that tentacle fuck victims? The options for the island vary from roleplay to roleplay. Ask for more details. **Conquest &amp; Corruption -** I been craving a plot where Kingdom falls to a dominant force and reduced to breeders. I tend to prefer elves being the victims but as long as the plot remains the same I am flexible. **Fertile Valley** \- Small town with boys growing horse-sized cock and girls literally bursting their bras. Our main character will either be FBI Agent sent to investigate or a local sheriff during the first days. Of course the 'hero' will be altered himself and start to indulge in the rampant incest/ageplay but that doesn't mean he still doesn't try to stop it from spreading. **Man With All The Gifts** \- A generic story about a man having unique abilities that slowly make him more powerful. It could be a new drug, nanites, gene manipulation, a curse, some alien tech, magic or a mutation.

I like ageplay in my stories (depending on the plot) and so should you. It's not mandatory but if want to up your chances to play with me you need to be OK with this kink. * **Breeding/Pregnancy** \- Not sure when I developed this kink but I love the idea of knocking up my companions. Its the connection that it creates putting a baby in a fertile womb. I am down to explore this kink all the way up to birth, such scenes involving that should happen off-screen. * **Corruption** \- Just like Transformation but changing of the mind. I like moving the dial of the character's morality and personality in a story. My favorite is a Lawful Good male becoming a Deviant Dominating Pervert. He doesn't need to be evil, he just needs to value sex over people. * **Domination** \- I like to be in control in most stories. Master/Slave, Daddy/Daughter, Alpha/Omega and so on. I don't mind stories that involve scenes where I am submissive but there is no chance I will do a plot where I remain that way. Where I don't turn the tables and take control of the woman who thought she was the mistress. * **Harem Play** \- Needless to say I am kind of greedy. I like plots where I claim multiple girls. If you think that's unfair, let me remind you I GM/DM 99% of my stories so the workload is more often then not on my shoulders. If you're willing to play a harem for me, you get to move to the front of the line. * **Incest** \- A family that plays together. Stays together. Incest is not a must but I love to have it appear in most plots. Improve your chances of playing by agreeing to exploring this kink. * **Interracial** \- I love a good mix of skin colors in the bedroom. I love the cultural differences and exploring how people fit. However, if I think you are a real racist; MAGA hat-wearing Neo-Nazi Trump voter. You can properly go fuck yourself. * **Mind Control** \- Closely related to corruption. I love playing with mind control. It can be easy like swinging a gem in front of your face until your under a trance or it can be hard like me slowly reprogramming your mind by altering memories. I enjoy both fantastical snap your fingers mind control and the realistic subliminal music/image approach that takes effect over time. * **Transformation** \- There is something about getting bigger, thicker, stronger, or turning from man to beast that turns me on. I like it when it happens to me. I like it when it happens to you. Most of my stories have TF to varying degrees. # Requirements So now you know about me and you want to grab my attention? There are some elements I think make some female players stand out above their peers and keep me interested. If you check off all or most of the items on this list then I promise you that I will respond to your DM in kind. [Requirements](URL * **Creative/Geeky/Perverted** \- The three cornerstones of a perfect female player. She should be creative enough to run with ideas, geeky enough to lots of canons she can draw inspiration from and perverted enough to get behind my lewd kinks. * **Humorous/Compassionate/Liberal** \- Beyond the three cornerstones for a perfect roleplayer above, I find these personality traits highly desirable. Far too many players with a stick up their ass, mistreating other human beings online and worst of all conservative in their beliefs. * **Playing on Discord** \- I pretty much play exclusively on Discord now. With the private servers, easy image sharing, and being able to edit a post after its sent. It's easily THE BEST way to roleplay. Reddit is good for the initial PM only. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female that won't cut it for me. If your trans, you can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling it or not. Thanks for understanding * **Switch or Submissive** **Females** \- I don't mind rolling in bed with a woman who likes to take control but more often then not I like to be the alpha in the bedroom. I am not saying NO to dominant woman, just understand my goal is to eventually 'break' you. * **Flexible Age Range** \- Stories often have a variety of characters. Expect to play underage characters in these stories. If you have issues with ageplay we can make them NPC style characters who are present but don't get involved in sex. The more flexible you are the better your chances. * **Multiple Character Stories** \- The stories I write are complex. I often take on a DM/GM role writing the world with multiple characters (I won't say no to a female DM/GMing for me). If you are a player who can only write one character, I mean no offense but my stories are to complex for you. * **Open Book Players** \- I want to get to know you. I will ask you A/S/L, your first name and some other personal questions about who you are. That said, I **WILL NEVER** ask for your phone number, personal email, where you work, or your last name. There are details that can be shared that preserve your anonymity and others that compromise it. I aim to protect you and myself while getting to know you some. * **Quantity and Quality** \- Writing a quality post can be hard. There are various elements that can undermine a post. Repeating what I said in your post and not adding anything new to the scene, god-modding characters (AKA Mary Suing), one-liner responses, and the list goes on. I am willing to invest time and effort into playing with you, I don't think it's unfair for you to do the same with me. * **Voice Chat and Expanded Relationship** \- I love voice chatting with people, like a lewd phone call on Discord where we chat and get passed all the small talk/story prep quickly with our words. If you're open to chatting like this then you get to move to the front of the line. If you want to do other things besides roleplay like play games on Steam, caption pics, or share lewd Tumblr gifs and hentai. You get bonus points for those as well. * **Hard No Kinks** \- I will NOT play ANY of these kinks, I won't kink shame you but having any of these in your prompt history will discourage me from playing: Diapers/Infantilism, Snuff, Mutilation/Nullification, Gore, Obese/Fat/Hyper Fat, Vomiting, Gas/Farting, Blood, Scat, STD's, Popping, Prolapsing, and Toilet Play. If a kink relates to this list then I probably don't want to involve it. # Closing So there you have it my long-winded post to catch quality female players like you. Reddit isn't a great space to hunt for female players if only because there are 10 to 1 male to female ratio and lesser males love to downvote other \[M4F\] posts above/below their own. If you have read this full post; Good Job, Gold Star! Shoot me a Message (Reddit chat is hot garbage), if we click well we will move this party to Discord where hopefully we will play for a very very long time.

Halloween and Christmas are the best seasons. * **Incest -** The family that plays together stays together. * **Interracial** \- White Male w/Asian, Latina, Black, Muslim, Jewish, Etc * **JollyJacked** \- Stories based on anthrofication, muscle expansion, and growth.

I like ageplay in my stories (depending on the plot) and so should you. It's not mandatory but if want to up your chances to play with me you need to be OK with this kink. * **Breeding/Pregnancy** \- Not sure when I developed this kink but I love the idea of knocking up my companions. Its the connection that it creates putting a baby in a fertile womb. I am down to explore this kink all the way up to birth, such scenes involving that should happen off-screen. * **Corruption** \- Just like Transformation but changing of the mind. I like moving the dial of the character's morality and personality in a story. My favorite is a Lawful Good male becoming a Deviant Dominating Pervert. He doesn't need to be evil, he just needs to value sex over people. * **Domination** \- I like to be in control in most stories. Master/Slave, Daddy/Daughter, Alpha/Omega and so on. I don't mind stories that involve scenes where I am submissive but there is no chance I will do a plot where I remain that way. Where I don't turn the tables and take control of the woman who thought she was the mistress. * **Harem Play** \- Needless to say I am kind of greedy. I like plots where I claim multiple girls. If you think that's unfair, let me remind you I GM/DM 99% of my stories so the workload is more often then not on my shoulders. If you're willing to play a harem for me, you get to move to the front of the line. * **Incest** \- A family that plays together. Stays together. Incest is not a must but I love to have it appear in most plots. Improve your chances of playing by agreeing to exploring this kink. * **Interracial** \- I love a good mix of skin colors in the bedroom. I love the cultural differences and exploring how people fit. However, if I think you are a real racist; MAGA hat-wearing Neo-Nazi Trump voter. You can properly go fuck yourself. * **Mind Control** \- Closely related to corruption. I love playing with mind control. It can be easy like swinging a gem in front of your face until your under a trance or it can be hard like me slowly reprogramming your mind by altering memories. I enjoy both fantastical snap your fingers mind control and the realistic subliminal music/image approach that takes effect over time. * **Transformation** \- There is something about getting bigger, thicker, stronger, or turning from man to beast that turns me on. I like it when it happens to me. I like it when it happens to you. Most of my stories have TF to varying degrees. # Requirements So now you know about me and you want to grab my attention? There are some elements I think make some female players stand out above their peers and keep me interested. If you check off all or most of the items on this list then I promise you that I will respond to your DM in kind. [Requirements](URL * **Creative/Geeky/Perverted** \- The three cornerstones of a perfect female player. She should be creative enough to run with ideas, geeky enough to lots of canons she can draw inspiration from and perverted enough to get behind my lewd kinks. * **Humorous/Compassionate/Liberal** \- Beyond the three cornerstones for a perfect roleplayer above, I find these personality traits highly desirable. Far too many players with a stick up their ass, mistreating other human beings online and worst of all conservative in their beliefs. * **Playing on Discord** \- I pretty much play exclusively on Discord now. With the private servers, easy image sharing, and being able to edit a post after its sent. It's easily THE BEST way to roleplay. Reddit is good for the initial PM only. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female that won't cut it for me. If your trans, you can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling it or not. Thanks for understanding * **Switch or Submissive** **Females** \- I don't mind rolling in bed with a woman who likes to take control but more often then not I like to be the alpha in the bedroom. I am not saying NO to dominant woman, just understand my goal is to eventually 'break' you. * **Flexible Age Range** \- Stories often have a variety of characters. Expect to play underage characters in these stories. If you have issues with ageplay we can make them NPC style characters who are present but don't get involved in sex. The more flexible you are the better your chances. * **Multiple Character Stories** \- The stories I write are complex. I often take on a DM/GM role writing the world with multiple characters (I won't say no to a female DM/GMing for me). If you are a player who can only write one character, I mean no offense but my stories are to complex for you. * **Open Book Players** \- I want to get to know you. I will ask you A/S/L, your first name and some other personal questions about who you are. That said, I **WILL NEVER** ask for your phone number, personal email, where you work, or your last name. There are details that can be shared that preserve your anonymity and others that compromise it. I aim to protect you and myself while getting to know you some. * **Quantity and Quality** \- Writing a quality post can be hard. There are various elements that can undermine a post. Repeating what I said in your post and not adding anything new to the scene, god-modding characters (AKA Mary Suing), one-liner responses, and the list goes on. I am willing to invest time and effort into playing with you, I don't think it's unfair for you to do the same with me. * **Voice Chat and Expanded Relationship** \- I love voice chatting with people, like a lewd phone call on Discord where we chat and get passed all the small talk/story prep quickly with our words. If you're open to chatting like this then you get to move to the front of the line. If you want to do other things besides roleplay like play games on Steam, caption pics, or share lewd Tumblr gifs and hentai. You get bonus points for those as well. * **Hard No Kinks** \- I will NOT play ANY of these kinks, I won't kink shame you but having any of these in your prompt history will discourage me from playing: Diapers/Infantilism, Snuff, Mutilation/Nullification, Gore, Obese/Fat/Hyper Fat, Vomiting, Gas/Farting, Blood, Scat, STD's, Popping, Prolapsing, and Toilet Play. If a kink relates to this list then I probably don't want to involve it. # Closing So there you have it my long-winded post to catch quality female players like you. Reddit isn't a great space to hunt for female players if only because there are 10 to 1 male to female ratio and lesser males love to downvote other \[M4F\] posts above/below their own.

I like ageplay in my stories (depending on the plot) and so should you. It's not mandatory but if want to up your chances to play with me you need to be OK with this kink. * **Breeding/Pregnancy** \- Not sure when I developed this kink but I love the idea of knocking up my companions. Its the connection that it creates putting a baby in a fertile womb. I am down to explore this kink all the way up to birth, such scenes involving that should happen off-screen. * **Corruption** \- Just like Transformation but changing of the mind. I like moving the dial of the character's morality and personality in a story. My favorite is a Lawful Good male becoming a Deviant Dominating Pervert. He doesn't need to be evil, he just needs to value sex over people. * **Domination** \- I like to be in control in most stories. Master/Slave, Daddy/Daughter, Alpha/Omega and so on. I don't mind stories that involve scenes where I am submissive but there is no chance I will do a plot where I remain that way. Where I don't turn the tables and take control of the woman who thought she was the mistress. * **Harem Play** \- Needless to say I am kind of greedy. I like plots where I claim multiple girls. If you think that's unfair, let me remind you I GM/DM 99% of my stories so the workload is more often then not on my shoulders. If you're willing to play a harem for me, you get to move to the front of the line. * **Incest** \- A family that plays together. Stays together. Incest is not a must but I love to have it appear in most plots. Improve your chances of playing by agreeing to exploring this kink. * **Interracial** \- I love a good mix of skin colors in the bedroom. I love the cultural differences and exploring how people fit. However, if I think you are a real racist; MAGA hat-wearing Neo-Nazi Trump voter. You can properly go fuck yourself. * **Mind Control** \- Closely related to corruption. I love playing with mind control. It can be easy like swinging a gem in front of your face until your under a trance or it can be hard like me slowly reprogramming your mind by altering memories. I enjoy both fantastical snap your fingers mind control and the realistic subliminal music/image approach that takes effect over time. * **Transformation** \- There is something about getting bigger, thicker, stronger, or turning from man to beast that turns me on. I like it when it happens to me. I like it when it happens to you. Most of my stories have TF to varying degrees. # Requirements So now you know about me and you want to grab my attention? There are some elements I think make some female players stand out above their peers and keep me interested. If you check off all or most of the items on this list then I promise you that I will respond to your DM in kind. [Requirements](URL * **Creative/Geeky/Perverted** \- The three cornerstones of a perfect female player. She should be creative enough to run with ideas, geeky enough to lots of canons she can draw inspiration from and perverted enough to get behind my lewd kinks. * **Humorous/Compassionate/Liberal** \- Beyond the three cornerstones for a perfect roleplayer above, I find these personality traits highly desirable. Far too many players with a stick up their ass, mistreating other human beings online and worst of all conservative in their beliefs. * **Playing on Discord** \- I pretty much play exclusively on Discord now. With the private servers, easy image sharing, and being able to edit a post after its sent. It's easily THE BEST way to roleplay. Reddit is good for the initial PM only. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female that won't cut it for me. If your trans, you can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling it or not. Thanks for understanding * **Switch or Submissive** **Females** \- I don't mind rolling in bed with a woman who likes to take control but more often then not I like to be the alpha in the bedroom. I am not saying NO to dominant woman, just understand my goal is to eventually 'break' you. * **Flexible Age Range** \- Stories often have a variety of characters. Expect to play underage characters in these stories. If you have issues with ageplay we can make them NPC style characters who are present but don't get involved in sex. The more flexible you are the better your chances. * **Multiple Character Stories** \- The stories I write are complex. I often take on a DM/GM role writing the world with multiple characters (I won't say no to a female DM/GMing for me). If you are a player who can only write one character, I mean no offense but my stories are to complex for you. * **Open Book Players** \- I want to get to know you. I will ask you A/S/L, your first name and some other personal questions about who you are. That said, I **WILL NEVER** ask for your phone number, personal email, where you work, or your last name. There are details that can be shared that preserve your anonymity and others that compromise it. I aim to protect you and myself while getting to know you some. * **Quantity and Quality** \- Writing a quality post can be hard. There are various elements that can undermine a post. Repeating what I said in your post and not adding anything new to the scene, god-modding characters (AKA Mary Suing), one-liner responses, and the list goes on. I am willing to invest time and effort into playing with you, I don't think it's unfair for you to do the same with me. * **Voice Chat and Expanded Relationship** \- I love voice chatting with people, like a lewd phone call on Discord where we chat and get passed all the small talk/story prep quickly with our words. If you're open to chatting like this then you get to move to the front of the line. If you want to do other things besides roleplay like play games on Steam, caption pics, or share lewd Tumblr gifs and hentai. You get bonus points for those as well. * **Hard No Kinks** \- I will NOT play ANY of these kinks, I won't kink shame you but having any of these in your prompt history will discourage me from playing: Diapers/Infantilism, Snuff, Mutilation/Nullification, Gore, Obese/Fat/Hyper Fat, Vomiting, Gas/Farting, Blood, Scat, STD's, Popping, Prolapsing, and Toilet Play. If a kink relates to this list then I probably don't want to involve it. # Closing So there you have it my long-winded post to catch quality female players like you. Reddit isn't a great space to hunt for female players if only because there are 10 to 1 male to female ratio and lesser males love to downvote other \[M4F\] posts above/below their own. If you have read this full post; Good Job, Gold Star! Shoot me a Message (Reddit chat is hot garbage), if we click well we will move this party to Discord where hopefully we will play for a very very long time.

Harry Potter crossover open. * **Zootopia -** Judy and Nick get to fucking.

I like ageplay in my stories (depending on the plot) and so should you. It's not mandatory but if want to up your chances to play with me you need to be OK with this kink. * **Breeding/Pregnancy** \- Not sure when I developed this kink but I love the idea of knocking up my companions. Its the connection that it creates putting a baby in a fertile womb. I am down to explore this kink all the way up to birth, such scenes involving that should happen off-screen. * **Corruption** \- Just like Transformation but changing of the mind. I like moving the dial of the character's morality and personality in a story. My favorite is a Lawful Good male becoming a Deviant Dominating Pervert. He doesn't need to be evil, he just needs to value sex over people. * **Domination** \- I like to be in control in most stories. Master/Slave, Daddy/Daughter, Alpha/Omega and so on. I don't mind stories that involve scenes where I am submissive but there is no chance I will do a plot where I remain that way. Where I don't turn the tables and take control of the woman who thought she was the mistress. * **Harem Play** \- Needless to say I am kind of greedy. I like plots where I claim multiple girls. If you think that's unfair, let me remind you I GM/DM 99% of my stories so the workload is more often then not on my shoulders. If you're willing to play a harem for me, you get to move to the front of the line. * **Incest** \- A family that plays together. Stays together. Incest is not a must but I love to have it appear in most plots. Improve your chances of playing by agreeing to exploring this kink. * **Interracial** \- I love a good mix of skin colors in the bedroom. I love the cultural differences and exploring how people fit. However, if I think you are a real racist; MAGA hat-wearing Neo-Nazi Trump voter. You can properly go fuck yourself. * **Mind Control** \- Closely related to corruption. I love playing with mind control. It can be easy like swinging a gem in front of your face until your under a trance or it can be hard like me slowly reprogramming your mind by altering memories. I enjoy both fantastical snap your fingers mind control and the realistic subliminal music/image approach that takes effect over time. * **Transformation** \- There is something about getting bigger, thicker, stronger, or turning from man to beast that turns me on. I like it when it happens to me. I like it when it happens to you. Most of my stories have TF to varying degrees. # Requirements So now you know about me and you want to grab my attention? There are some elements I think make some female players stand out above their peers and keep me interested. If you check off all or most of the items on this list then I promise you that I will respond to your DM in kind. [Requirements](URL * **Creative/Geeky/Perverted** \- The three cornerstones of a perfect female player. She should be creative enough to run with ideas, geeky enough to lots of canons she can draw inspiration from and perverted enough to get behind my lewd kinks. * **Humorous/Compassionate/Liberal** \- Beyond the three cornerstones for a perfect roleplayer above, I find these personality traits highly desirable. Far too many players with a stick up their ass, mistreating other human beings online and worst of all conservative in their beliefs. * **Playing on Discord** \- I pretty much play exclusively on Discord now. With the private servers, easy image sharing, and being able to edit a post after its sent. It's easily THE BEST way to roleplay. Reddit is good for the initial PM only. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female that won't cut it for me. If your trans, you can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling it or not. Thanks for understanding * **Switch or Submissive** **Females** \- I don't mind rolling in bed with a woman who likes to take control but more often then not I like to be the alpha in the bedroom. I am not saying NO to dominant woman, just understand my goal is to eventually 'break' you. * **Flexible Age Range** \- Stories often have a variety of characters. Expect to play underage characters in these stories. If you have issues with ageplay we can make them NPC style characters who are present but don't get involved in sex. The more flexible you are the better your chances. * **Multiple Character Stories** \- The stories I write are complex. I often take on a DM/GM role writing the world with multiple characters (I won't say no to a female DM/GMing for me). If you are a player who can only write one character, I mean no offense but my stories are to complex for you. * **Open Book Players** \- I want to get to know you. I will ask you A/S/L, your first name and some other personal questions about who you are. That said, I **WILL NEVER** ask for your phone number, personal email, where you work, or your last name. There are details that can be shared that preserve your anonymity and others that compromise it. I aim to protect you and myself while getting to know you some. * **Quantity and Quality** \- Writing a quality post can be hard. There are various elements that can undermine a post. Repeating what I said in your post and not adding anything new to the scene, god-modding characters (AKA Mary Suing), one-liner responses, and the list goes on. I am willing to invest time and effort into playing with you, I don't think it's unfair for you to do the same with me. * **Voice Chat and Expanded Relationship** \- I love voice chatting with people, like a lewd phone call on Discord where we chat and get passed all the small talk/story prep quickly with our words. If you're open to chatting like this then you get to move to the front of the line. If you want to do other things besides roleplay like play games on Steam, caption pics, or share lewd Tumblr gifs and hentai. You get bonus points for those as well. * **Hard No Kinks** \- I will NOT play ANY of these kinks, I won't kink shame you but having any of these in your prompt history will discourage me from playing: Diapers/Infantilism, Snuff, Mutilation/Nullification, Gore, Obese/Fat/Hyper Fat, Vomiting, Gas/Farting, Blood, Scat, STD's, Popping, Prolapsing, and Toilet Play. If a kink relates to this list then I probably don't want to involve it. # Closing So there you have it my long-winded post to catch quality female players like you. Reddit isn't a great space to hunt for female players if only because there are 10 to 1 male to female ratio and lesser males love to downvote other \[M4F\] posts above/below their own. If you have read this full post; Good Job, Gold Star! Shoot me a Message (Reddit chat is hot garbage), if we click well we will move this party to Discord where hopefully we will play for a very very long time.

I am a long time roleplayer who has been writing erotic stories for nearly 20+ years now, so needless to say I am experienced and have lots of lewd ideas. If you want some more personal info on me.

If a kink relates to this list then I probably don't want to involve it. # Current Story Cravings **NA** \- This will be filled in soon. # Original Stories **Body Shifters** \- The Body Shifters are a 'female' alien species that live for/crave/eat cum in order to stay healthy. They can alter their bodies at will changing size, shape, color, and clothes at a thought. They are loyal to their human lovers who they feed off of by fucking/sucking all day long. Our story will follow one of this lucky males who gets hooked up with one of these alien babes and trying to keep her a secret while his life becomes one of sex and keeping his alien girls happy. Oh did I mention the more you feed them that they eventually get so big that they split into two new girls? Yeah... that happens. &amp;#x200B; **Castaways** \- A simple plot of either crash landing or being shipwrecked on a deserted island (or planet if Scifi setting). I always liked the concept of being alone and working hard to survive. Of course as a erotic roleplay a guy on a island by himself jerking off is pretty boring, so we are gonna have some girls wash up on that island with him! What will they find on the island? Who knows. Could be amazon tribe, a lost fertility goddess, the fountain of youth, human sized venus fly taps with tentacles, or mind/body altering plants that make us into animals. The possibilities are endless but the premises is always the same. &amp;#x200B; **Dawn of the Breasts** \- Its basically a zombie story only instead of rotting corpses ravaging people, the infected are naked horny and feral bimbos/himbos. No killing needed for this plot all it takes is some cum, breast milk or saliva to start someones inevitable fall to this very sexy disease. Transformation plays a big role here were people take a load and start to put on hyper fertile curves before chasing down their friends and family to turn them as well. There are lots of places to start a story like which makes it highly erotic and versatile. &amp;#x200B; **Dirty Politics** \- A recent idea I been playing with is exploring someones rise to power in the modern political age. He can either be a brilliant politician or have mind control abilities allowing him to get what he needs/wants done quickly. Politically speaking his ideas are often for the best of society and does right by the people but behind closed doors he will make his opponents daughters his own personal sluts to spy on their fathers and help him build a empire of influence under his enemies noses. We may even use famous politicians to do it. &amp;#x200B; **Fertile Valley** \- If you read erotica on the web then you likely came across Fertile Valley. While not every aspect of the original story turned me on the concept of a small secluded town affected by their tainted water supply was something that stuck with me. I am looking for a imagining of this plot with a federal agent moving to the town to find out what the fuck is going on only to have the effects start to alter him and his family. The question is will he stop it before he is too far gone or will he give into the pleasure and embrace the communities incestuous culture? Only one way to find out. &amp;#x200B; **La Resistance** \- A story for all you history lovers out there who love period pieces. La Resistance follows the French Resistance in Paris during WW2. The general plot of the story follows a OSS Operative from the US sent into France to help establish the resistance and help them defeat the Nazis. The team he build will be mostly (if not all) female operatives from various walks of life. I have some characters already created and while French girl is the largest group we also have German, English, Irish, Russian, and American girls among the list of playable characters. If this interests you let me know and I can share what I have written so far. &amp;#x200B; **Man With All The Gifts** \- A relatively generic plot considering all the other stories on the list. I bachelor, father, divorced dad, and/or teacher is given a new lot in life be in magic, miracle pill, alien ray gun, or body altering nanites or whatever. Whatever starts the changes it will allow him to become more over time and eventually make him a demi-god among men. Naturally as any demi-god would do, he starts to claim the women of his life! Coworkers, old girlfriends, ex-wife, daughters, daughters friends, neighbors and so on. It's really a male power fantasy but I find a fair amount of female players wanting to be claimed by a true alpha. An there arnt any bigger alphas than him! &amp;#x200B; **I Love Puazi** \- The Puazi are an alien species who moved to earth to cohabitate with humanity. Thats the general setting in a nutshell. The fun part about the Puazi is their biology makes them really into the smells of earth mammals, primarily humans. The musk makes them sway on their feet, go cross eyed and crave that drug that is a human climax in their mouth. If you don't know the Puazi, I would suggest googling Puazi Incase and getting to know the source material! I promise its worth the read of those lewd comics. &amp;#x200B; **Only We Remain** \- If you get to know me, you will find that I have a deep affection for zombie plots. The scavenging, rebuilding, survival, and fighting create a very compelling plot. Only We Remain (Parodyish title of the Last of Us) follows a alien spore that starts converting men into undead monsters. Its harder to elaborate on then other stories as I have infected types, locations, survivor groups, and the science of infection pretty clearly laid out. If you want a true zombie survival plot that is 2/3rds plots and 1/3rd sex? This is the best plot for you. &amp;#x200B; **Rise of the Wolves** \- Jay Naylor put out a comic called the Fall of Little Red Riding Hood which gave life to that old tale. The Wolves were a tribe and they discovered that humans were quite breedable and made wonderful fleshy lovers. In that vain, I plan to explore the source content more fully writing out a plot of how the Wolves begin to take human settlements and make humanity their literal bitches. Its a wonderful anthro on human story line, it has lots of corruption and even transformation play involved. If you want to get fucked by literal big bad wolfs, this is a good plot for you. &amp;#x200B; **Supernatural Girlfriend AKA My Little Succubus** \- A general story I been working on is slice of life story with Succubus Girlfriend. As I continued to write this setting I started to think about other potential Super Natural Lovers. A Vampire Girlfriend who requires to feed on me from time to time and loves to watch movies all night, a Ghost Girlfriend who is around the time but is never really there, an Orc Girlfriend who is as strong as me and really loves sports but has a temper. Its clever collection of couples in a modern setting exploring how we 'click' as lovers. If you want to play multiple girlfriends I wont say no to such a story, I also have supernatural boyfriends encase you want to be human female with her hung werewolf boyfriend or whatever. &amp;#x200B; **Wincestor House** \- Wincestor House is a basically a haunted mansion or manor that has sexualized ghosts who to fuck the family that moves in. This is easily my most incestuous plot on the list and has things like possession, phantom lovers, flashbacks to other lives, and living objects involved in the plot. I try not to make it a horror movie but nor do I want it to be boring or tame. Its somewhere between House on Haunted Hill, Crimson Peak, Poltergeist and pinch of Casper with a big scoop of porn. I have a primary plot focused on the occult and witchcraft connected to family sex but that plot isnt for everyone so ask me what other options I have if that's not your thing. &amp;#x200B; **Other Originals** \- I have dozens of other plots unposted. Alpha Formula - Chemical turns man into a half man/half wolf beast. Family Farm - A family is turned into beasts of burden on their own farm. Invasion of the Space Futa - Alien Amazons with Cocks invade earth. Master PC - Reality altering PC program changes peoples reality with a few times. And the list goes on. If you have ideas of your own feel free to share, I might have a plot for that. # Canon Stories **The 13 Kingdoms**: *A Disney Story* \- The various Disney Girls reimagined in a interconnected world that plays a lot like with Lord of the Rings with a fair amount of strong female characters. I typically play ""The Big Bad Wolf"" in these stories as a former hero who was twisted by dark powers and now resides in a gray area where he is neither trusted by the Princesses or the Wicked Witches. We can discuss where you might like to take this plot. &amp;#x200B; **Apex**: *A Overwatch Story* \- A new villain called APEX emerges as a nanite infused human who seeks to get revenge on the members of Overwatch and steal their tech. There is no doubt he will enslave them making them into wanton sluts once he has their way with them. Certain characters hold high value like Tracers whos chest plate will allow APEX to distort time. The more he claims the more dangerous he becomes. Will Overwatch and Talon join forces to stop this new foe who seeks to rule the world? &amp;#x200B; **Big Bad Wolf:** *A Witcher Story* \- Geralt is one of the stronger male characters in the past 20 years. I would love to do a simple story with him hunting monsters and having various romantic encounters. If that doesnt scratch your itch he can be corrupted by a perverted mutagen or come down a case of the Werewolfs before breeding Yen, Triss, and Ciri. Please at least know the video games. &amp;#x200B; **Darkest Night**: *A Batman Story* \- Batman isn't terribly interesting but he is fit, smart, rich and in my stories hung. I like a good plot where he is corrupted by Ivy into her equal or a injection from Harley that makes him lose control. The how/why are flexible but what happens after is always the same. He starts to fuck the hell out of the women of Gotham and he takes the best ones back to Wayne Manor to be his harem of super women. &amp;#x200B; **Distant Corners:** *A Star Trek Story* \- I been super eager to meet a female Trekkie who wants to build and OC crew and explore the universe. This is nothing short of an undertaking and we need to be sure we click as players before investing the time and energy into populating a crew. If done right we will have a strong female crew getting into sexy adventures in no time! &amp;#x200B; **Emerging Reality**: *A Marvel/DC Story* \- I been exploring the merging of universes them with Marvel/DC coming together. I even added Overwatch, Lara Croft, Ben 10 and other settings to the same universe. The means changes from the Infinity Stones merging worlds or some other macguffin causing the realities to merge. My favorite character to play is Green Lantern and I have merged him once with Peter Parker making a new character. Super Flexible here with who the lead male can be and where we take the plot. &amp;#x200B; **Fang:** *A Miraculous Story* \- I watched this show with my niece and thought it be fun to write a story where a more dominant older character stepped in and fought crime with Lady Bug. I already settled with this character being a Wolf, about 30 something years old and dominating the fuck out of the school girls in this setting. Expect a very different kind of Miraculous story if you undertake this with me. &amp;#x200B; **The Gray Jedi:** *The Star Wars Story* \- I don't always play Star Wars stories but when I do I am Gray Jedi Master who fucks his padawans. Really though most Star Wars plots are great but I prefer the Old Republic over any other setting. Multiple padwans are desired in this setting. OC characters are great. Canon women are more then welcome. &amp;#x200B; **The King of the North:** *A* *Game of Thrones* \- I do A LOT of retcons on Game of Thrones and 95% of them are saving a hot female from a untimely death. Moving beyond that I usually explore a plot where Jon Snow becomes a dominant stud and starts to build an empire in the North and in the wombs of any woman he see's fit. The means of corruption usually comes from Ygritte shooting some arrows into him only this time the arrows are poisoned and he gets changed by the experience. Does he get bigger and stronger? Just a massive cock? Maybe he turns into Wolf or Dragon? Who knows! Well I do but I mean what do you want from this story. &amp;#x200B; **Lord of Columbia**: *A Bioshock Story* \- Elizabeth from Bioshock might be one of my top 10 females from video games; Lara Croft, Sarah Kerrigan, and Tali'Zorah also make that list. What makes me want to put her on this list? Reality hopping. I love the idea of her teaming up with her Daddy (Booker) and helping him find other versions of her and making them his. Its perverted, incestous and has themes of ageplay, harems, and breeding but I fucking love it. Even more so if he takes Rapture as well. This is pretty much for pervs who love Bioshock as much as me. &amp;#x200B; **Normandy Harem:** *Mass Effect Story* \- There are three avenues to make Shepard become 'evil'. Cerberus Nanites, Collector Parasites, or Reaper Indoctrination Device. I tend to prefer the first option but the result always leads him to fucking the women of the Normandy. Is this plot not your thing? I have ideas for Andromeda and a clone program that makes a bunch of female Shepards. &amp;#x200B; **Symbiote Chronicles**: *A Spider-man Story* \- I find Peter Parker, bit of a Gary Stu. I actually really enjoyed how human they made him in Enter the Spider-Verse. I am getting off track. Point is, I play a more human Spider-man. He's not smarter then Stark, he cant lift two tanks, and he cant shoot a web faster then hammer of a pistol after the trigger is pulled. I am off track again. Spider-Man. Sexual Deviant. Venom Symbiote. Lots of Sex. Mary Jane. Gwen Stacey. Snoo Snoo. You get the idea. &amp;#x200B; **Tongue of the Dragon:** *A Skyrim Story* \- A shelved story idea I been to fucking lazy to finish. Sexy Dragon Shouts. Is it possible? Actually yeah the vocab is there but I haven't spent the time to put together a list of perverted shouts. Shouts that would rip armor off a female warriors body, make a person instantly more submissive or make them susceptible to mind control. It should be noted &amp;#x200B; **Vault Alpha:** *A Fallout Story* \- I have about 10 Vaults I made for the Fallout setting. Hands down my favorite is Vault Alpha also known as a cultural preservation vault. A girls school with a bunch of students from all over the world (including communist China) and their cultures knowledge saved with them. Of course, there was a boys school with same objective but they didn't survive (or did they?) but with the tunnel joining the vaults collapsed they wont find out anytime soon. Its a fun take on Fallout and one I love to explore. If thats not your thing guess what? I got more fucking fallout plots! &amp;#x200B; **Other Canon** \- Honestly the list of games, books, movies, shows, cartoon, anime, and comics goes on forever. Make a list of your favorites from those listed media mediums and present them in conversation. I will let you know which ones I know and are willing to play. I freely admit my anime/manga selection is limited to mostly what comes across Adult Swim. # Generic Stories **Angels &amp; Demons** \- Summoning an Incubus, Hell on Earth with angels and demons fighting for souls, a taboo coupling of angel and demon, and more. I love a good Heaven and Hell story. &amp;#x200B; **Cyber/Bio/Nanopunk** \- I tend to lean towards criminals, hackers, ex-military types, and noir style detectives. I always loved these setting where humanity has blurred the lines between man and machine and began to twist his DNA to suit his needs. &amp;#x200B; **CYOA** \- There are now lewd CYOA's that exist online. If you have something that gets you nice and wet feel free to share. I have a F-list profile dedicated to my collection. &amp;#x200B; **End of the World/Post Apoc** \- Gritty stories where the world has ended by drought, plague, radiation, virus or even the undead. While I would never wish this on humanity it does bring peoples character to the surface. Are you a Criminal? A Survivor? A reluctant hero? A submissive? The end of the world will let you know. &amp;#x200B; **Fantasy** \- Orcs, Centaurs, Elves, and Demons! Oh my! I personally love Conquest plots where kingdoms fall to invaders who take the spoils. Other stories like a demonic curse or princess in hiding also interest me. &amp;#x200B; **Fairy Tales** \- I love a good folk tale! We can keep it in the fantasy setting or shift it to a modern setting. Alternatively I been exploring polytheistic gods in the same lense as Fairy Tales, so if you want to see stories about Zeus. Let me know. &amp;#x200B; **Furries** \- Oh god he rights furry stories as well? Yeah I fucking do. I am a Big Bad Wolf who ruts foxes and bunnies wanna fight about it? &amp;#x200B; **Free Use World** \- NA &amp;#x200B; **Holiday** \- NA &amp;#x200B; **Incest** \- NA &amp;#x200B; **Interracial** \- NA &amp;#x200B; **Military/Spies** \- NA &amp;#x200B; **Modern Fantasy** \- NA &amp;#x200B; **Monsters** \- NA &amp;#x200B; **Scifi** \- NA &amp;#x200B; **Slasher** \- NA &amp;#x200B; **Space Opera** \- NA &amp;#x200B; **Steam/Diesel/Atom/Clockpunk** \- NA &amp;#x200B; **Super Heroes** \- NA &amp;#x200B; **Supernatural** \- NA &amp;#x200B; **Toons** \- NA &amp;#x200B; **Westerns** \- I found Westerns are pretty hard plots to get off the ground. When I have written plots like this its mostly bounty hunting or building a homestead with a strong female and her son. I only have a few working ideas for this setting so meet me half way on the brainstorming. &amp;#x200B; **Witches &amp; Warlocks** \- After watching that new Sabrina, witchcraft has been on my mind. If you want to explore a setting that explores Witchcraft be in our modern world or Hogwarts I am down. &amp;#x200B; **Other Settings** \- I probably missed some things like Tron, Gor, Robots, and historical periods. If you have something you like feel free to suggest it. Worse case scenario is me saying ""No Thanks"" and suggesting something else. Be creative and feel free to mix and match ideas like Cyberpunk and Zombies, sounds fucking awesome to me. # Top Kinks * **Ageplay** \- Loli's and Jailbait to Milfs and Dilfs. I like ageplay in my stories (depending on the plot) and so should you. It's not mandatory but if want to up your chances to play with me you need to be ok with this kink. * **Breeding/Pregnancy** \- Not sure when I developed this kink but I love the idea of knocking up my companions. Its the connection that it creates putting a baby in a fertile womb. I am down to explore this kink all the way up to birth, such scenes involving that should happen off screen. * **Corruption** \- Just like Transformation but changing of the mind. I like moving the dial of characters morality and personality in a story. My favorite is a Lawful Good male becoming a Deviant Dominating Pervert. He doesnt need to be evil, he just needs to value sex over people. * **Domination** \- I like to be in control in most stories. Master/Slave, Daddy/Daughter, Alpha/Omega and so on. I dont mind stories that involve scenes where I am submissive but there is no chance I will do a plot where I remain that way. Where I dont turn the tables and take control of the woman who thought she was the mistress. * **Harem Play** \- Needless to say I am kind of greedy. I like plots where I claim multiple girls. If you think thats unfair, let me remind you I GM/DM 99% of my stories so the work load is more often then not on my shoulders. If you're willing to play a harem for me, you get to move to the front of the line. * **Incest** \- A family that plays together. Stays together. Incest is not a must but I love to have it appear in most plots. Improve your chances of playing by agreeing to exploring this kink. * **Interracial** \- I love a good mix of skin colors in the bedroom. I love the cultural differences and exploring how people fit. However, if you I think you are a real racist; MAGA hat wearing Neo Nazi Trump voter. You can go fuck yourself. * **Mind Control** \- Closely related to corruption. I love playing with mind control. It can be easy like swinging a gem in front of your face until your under a trance or it can be hard like me slowly reprogramming your mind by altering memories. I enjoy both fantastical snap your fingers mind control and the realistic subliminal music/image approach that takes effect over time. * **Transformation** \- There is something about getting bigger, thicker, stronger, or turning from man to beast that turns me on. I like it when it happens to me. I like it when it happens to you. Most my stories have TF to varying degrees. # Closing So there you have it my long winded post to catch quality female players like you. Reddit isn't a great space to hunt for female players if only because there are 10 to 1 male to female ratio and lesser males love to downvote other \[M4F\] posts above/below their own. If you have read this full post; Good Job, Gold Star! Shoot me a Message (Reddit chat is hot garbage), if we click well we will move this party to Discord where hopefully we will play for a very very long time.

I am a long time roleplayer who has been writing erotic stories for nearly 20+ years now (weird to say that out loud), so needless to say I am highly experienced and have lots of [lewd ideas](URL I am a 33 Dominant Male Californian; I am over six feet tall, I have muscular/athletic body type (Soccer, Gym, Rock Climbing, Biking), vivid green eyes framed by black glasses and progressive views on the world. I am a open book willing to share some personal details about myself with you (well most details) and I hope you're willing to do the same for me. # Requirements So now you know about me and you want to grab my attention? There are some elements I think make some female players stand out above their peers and keep me interested. If you check off all or most of the items on this list then I promise you that I will respond to your DM in kind. [Requirements](URL * **Creative/Geeky/Perverted** \- The three corner stones of a perfect female player. She should be creative enough to run with ideas, geeky enough to lots of canon she can draw inspiration from and perverted enough to get behind my lewd kinks. * **Humorous/Compassionate/Liberal** \- Beyond the three corner stones for a perfect roleplayer above, I find these personality traits highly desirable. Far to many players with a stick up their ass, mistreating other human beings online and worst of all conservative in their beliefs. * **Playing on Discord** \- I pretty much play exclusively on Discord now. With the private servers, easy image sharing, and being able to edit a post after its sent. Its easily THE BEST way to roleplay. Reddit is good for initial PM only. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female that won't cut it for me. If your trans, you can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling it or not. Thanks for understanding * **Switch or Submissive** **Females** \- I don't mind rolling in bed with a woman who likes to take control but more often then not I like to be the alpha in the bedroom. I am not saying NO to dominant woman, just understand my goal is to eventually 'break' you. * **Flexible Age Range** \- Stories often have a variety of characters. Expect to play underage characters in these stories. If you have issues with ageplay we can make them NPC style characters who are present but don't get involved in sex. The more flexible you are the better your chances. * **Multiple Character Stories** \- The stories I write are complex. I often take on a DM/GM role writing the world with multiple characters (I wont say no to a female DM/GMing for me). If you are a player who can only write one character, I mean no offense but my stories are to complex for you. * **Open Book Players** \- I want to get to know you. I will ask you A/S/L, your first name and some other personal questions about who you are. That said, I **WILL NEVER** ask for your phone number, personal email, where you work, or your last name. There are details that can be shared that preserve your anonymity and others that compromise it. I aim to protect you and myself while getting to know you some. * **Quantity and Quality** \- Writing a quality post can be hard. There are various elements that can undermine a post. Repeating what I said in your post and not adding anything new to the scene, god modding characters (AKA Mary Suing), one liner responses, and the list goes on. I am willing to invest time and effort into playing with you, I don't think its unfair for you to do the same with me. * **Voice Chat and Expanded Relationship** \- I love voice chatting with people, like a lewd phone call on Discord where we chat and get passed all the small talk/story prep quickly with our words. If you're open to chatting like this then you get to move to the front of the line. If you want to do other things besides roleplay like play games on Steam, caption pics, or share lewd Tumblr gifs and hentai. You get bonus points for those as well. * **Hard No Kinks** \- I will NOT play ANY of these kinks, I wont kink shame you but having any of these in your prompt history will discourage me from playing: Diapers/Infantilism, Snuff, Mutilation/Nullification, Gore, Obese/Fat/Hyper Fat, Vomiting, Gas/Farting, Blood, Scat, STD's, Popping, Prolapsing, and Toilet Play. If a kink relates to this list then I probably don't want to involve it. I keep hitting the fucking character limit on Reddit which is making it hard for me to write all my lewd plots on this profile. So please consider this a tip of the iceburg of what I have to offer and if you have ideas feel free to share, there is a good chance I have character/plot/settings that will complement your work. # Top Desired Stories ^(\*\*Stories are organized alphabetically not in order of most to least desired. \*\*) **Around The World in 80 Lays** \- Based on the story Around the World In 80 Days.

Our main character will either be FBI Agent sent to investigate or a local sheriff during the first days. Of course the 'hero' will be altered himself and start to indulge in the rampant incest/ageplay but that doesn't mean he still doesn't try to stop it from spreading. **Man With All The Gifts** \- A generic story about a man having unique abilities that slowly make him more powerful.

I like ageplay in my stories (depending on the plot) and so should you. It's not mandatory but if want to up your chances to play with me you need to be OK with this kink. * **Breeding/Pregnancy** \- Not sure when I developed this kink but I love the idea of knocking up my companions. Its the connection that it creates putting a baby in a fertile womb. I am down to explore this kink all the way up to birth, such scenes involving that should happen off screen. * **Corruption** \- Just like Transformation but changing of the mind. I like moving the dial of characters morality and personality in a story. My favorite is a Lawful Good male becoming a Deviant Dominating Pervert. He doesnt need to be evil, he just needs to value sex over people. * **Domination** \- I like to be in control in most stories. Master/Slave, Daddy/Daughter, Alpha/Omega and so on. I dont mind stories that involve scenes where I am submissive but there is no chance I will do a plot where I remain that way. Where I dont turn the tables and take control of the woman who thought she was the mistress. * **Harem Play** \- Needless to say I am kind of greedy. I like plots where I claim multiple girls. If you think thats unfair, let me remind you I GM/DM 99% of my stories so the work load is more often then not on my shoulders. If you're willing to play a harem for me, you get to move to the front of the line. * **Incest** \- A family that plays together. Stays together. Incest is not a must but I love to have it appear in most plots. Improve your chances of playing by agreeing to exploring this kink. * **Interracial** \- I love a good mix of skin colors in the bedroom. I love the cultural differences and exploring how people fit. However, if you I think you are a real racist; MAGA hat wearing Neo Nazi Trump voter. You can properly go fuck yourself. * **Mind Control** \- Closely related to corruption. I love playing with mind control. It can be easy like swinging a gem in front of your face until your under a trance or it can be hard like me slowly reprogramming your mind by altering memories. I enjoy both fantastical snap your fingers mind control and the realistic subliminal music/image approach that takes effect over time. * **Transformation** \- There is something about getting bigger, thicker, stronger, or turning from man to beast that turns me on. I like it when it happens to me. I like it when it happens to you. Most my stories have TF to varying degrees. # Closing So there you have it my long winded post to catch quality female players like you. Reddit isn't a great space to hunt for female players if only because there are 10 to 1 male to female ratio and lesser males love to downvote other \[M4F\] posts above/below their own. If you have read this full post; Good Job, Gold Star! Shoot me a Message (Reddit chat is hot garbage), if we click well we will move this party to Discord where hopefully we will play for a very very long time.

No players under 18, please. Thank You.\*\*)* *^(\*\*Note: I won't always be in the mood to play all my stories. Suggest a few of your favorites.\*\*)* # About Me Hey, there my name is **Master of Perversions** or **Perversions** for short. I am a long-time roleplayer who has been writing erotic stories for nearly 20+ years now (weird to say that out loud), so needless to say I am highly experienced and have lots of [lewd ideas](URL I am a 33 Dominant Male Californian; I am over six feet tall, I have muscular/athletic body type (Soccer, Gym, Rock Climbing, Biking), vivid green eyes framed by black glasses and progressive views on the world. I am an open book willing to share some personal details about myself with you (well most details) and I hope you're willing to do the same for me. # Requirements So now you know about me and you want to grab my attention? There are some elements I think make some female players stand out above their peers and keep me interested. If you check off all or most of the items on this list then I promise you that I will respond to your DM in kind. [Requirements](URL * **Creative/Geeky/Perverted** \- The three cornerstones of a perfect female player. She should be creative enough to run with ideas, geeky enough to lots of canons she can draw inspiration from and perverted enough to get behind my lewd kinks. * **Humorous/Compassionate/Liberal** \- Beyond the three cornerstones for a perfect roleplayer above, I find these personality traits highly desirable. Far too many players with a stick up their ass, mistreating other human beings online and worst of all conservative in their beliefs. * **Playing on Discord** \- I pretty much play exclusively on Discord now. With the private servers, easy image sharing, and being able to edit a post after its sent. It's easily THE BEST way to roleplay. Reddit is good for the initial PM only. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female that won't cut it for me. If your trans, you can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling it or not. Thanks for understanding * **Switch or Submissive** **Females** \- I don't mind rolling in bed with a woman who likes to take control but more often then not I like to be the alpha in the bedroom. I am not saying NO to dominant woman, just understand my goal is to eventually 'break' you. * **Flexible Age Range** \- Stories often have a variety of characters. Expect to play underage characters in these stories. If you have issues with ageplay we can make them NPC style characters who are present but don't get involved in sex. The more flexible you are the better your chances. * **Multiple Character Stories** \- The stories I write are complex. I often take on a DM/GM role writing the world with multiple characters (I won't say no to a female DM/GMing for me). If you are a player who can only write one character, I mean no offense but my stories are to complex for you. * **Open Book Players** \- I want to get to know you. I will ask you A/S/L, your first name and some other personal questions about who you are. That said, I **WILL NEVER** ask for your phone number, personal email, where you work, or your last name. There are details that can be shared that preserve your anonymity and others that compromise it. I aim to protect you and myself while getting to know you some. * **Quantity and Quality** \- Writing a quality post can be hard. There are various elements that can undermine a post. Repeating what I said in your post and not adding anything new to the scene, god-modding characters (AKA Mary Suing), one-liner responses, and the list goes on. I am willing to invest time and effort into playing with you, I don't think it's unfair for you to do the same with me. * **Voice Chat and Expanded Relationship** \- I love voice chatting with people, like a lewd phone call on Discord where we chat and get passed all the small talk/story prep quickly with our words. If you're open to chatting like this then you get to move to the front of the line. If you want to do other things besides roleplay like play games on Steam, caption pics, or share lewd Tumblr gifs and hentai. You get bonus points for those as well. * **Hard No Kinks** \- I will NOT play ANY of these kinks, I won't kink shame you but having any of these in your prompt history will discourage me from playing: Diapers/Infantilism, Snuff, Mutilation/Nullification, Gore, Obese/Fat/Hyper Fat, Vomiting, Gas/Farting, Blood, Scat, STD's, Popping, Prolapsing, and Toilet Play. If a kink relates to this list then I probably don't want to involve it. I keep hitting the fucking character limit on Reddit which is making it hard for me to write all my lewd plots on this profile. So please consider this a tip of the iceberg of what I have to offer and if you have ideas feel free to share, there is a good chance I have character/plot/settings that will complement your work. # Top Desired Stories ^(\*\*Stories are organized alphabetically not in order of most to least desired. \*\*) **Around The World in 80 Lays** \- Based on the story Around the World In 80 Days.

I often play an Incubus or morally ambiguous angel. * **Cyber/Bio/Nanopunk -** I prefer to do a noir feeling for this setting.

I like ageplay in my stories (depending on the plot) and so should you. It's not mandatory but if want to up your chances to play with me you need to be OK with this kink. * **Breeding/Pregnancy** \- Not sure when I developed this kink but I love the idea of knocking up my companions. Its the connection that it creates putting a baby in a fertile womb. I am down to explore this kink all the way up to birth, such scenes involving that should happen off-screen. * **Corruption** \- Just like Transformation but changing of the mind. I like moving the dial of the character's morality and personality in a story. My favorite is a Lawful Good male becoming a Deviant Dominating Pervert. He doesn't need to be evil, he just needs to value sex over people. * **Domination** \- I like to be in control in most stories. Master/Slave, Daddy/Daughter, Alpha/Omega and so on.

Where I don't turn the tables and take control of the woman who thought she was the mistress. * **Harem Play** \- Needless to say I am kind of greedy. I like plots where I claim multiple girls. If you think that's unfair, let me remind you I GM/DM 99% of my stories so the workload is more often then not on my shoulders. If you're willing to play a harem for me, you get to move to the front of the line. * **Incest** \- A family that plays together. Stays together. Incest is not a must but I love to have it appear in most plots. Improve your chances of playing by agreeing to exploring this kink. * **Interracial** \- I love a good mix of skin colors in the bedroom. I love the cultural differences and exploring how people fit. However, if I think you are a real racist; MAGA hat-wearing Neo-Nazi Trump voter. You can properly go fuck yourself. * **Mind Control** \- Closely related to corruption. I love playing with mind control. It can be easy like swinging a gem in front of your face until your under a trance or it can be hard like me slowly reprogramming your mind by altering memories. I enjoy both fantastical snap your fingers mind control and the realistic subliminal music/image approach that takes effect over time. * **Transformation** \- There is something about getting bigger, thicker, stronger, or turning from man to beast that turns me on. I like it when it happens to me. I like it when it happens to you. Most of my stories have TF to varying degrees. # Closing So there you have it my long-winded post to catch quality female players like you.

I love playing with mind control. It can be easy like swinging a gem in front of your face until your under a trance or it can be hard like me slowly reprogramming your mind by altering memories.

I like it when it happens to me. I like it when it happens to you. Most of my stories have TF to varying degrees. # Requirements So now you know about me and you want to grab my attention? There are some elements I think make some female players stand out above their peers and keep me interested. If you check off all or most of the items on this list then I promise you that I will respond to your DM in kind. [Requirements](URL * **Creative/Geeky/Perverted** \- The three cornerstones of a perfect female player. She should be creative enough to run with ideas, geeky enough to lots of canons she can draw inspiration from and perverted enough to get behind my lewd kinks. * **Humorous/Compassionate/Liberal** \- Beyond the three cornerstones for a perfect roleplayer above, I find these personality traits highly desirable. Far too many players with a stick up their ass, mistreating other human beings online and worst of all conservative in their beliefs. * **Playing on Discord** \- I pretty much play exclusively on Discord now. With the private servers, easy image sharing, and being able to edit a post after its sent. It's easily THE BEST way to roleplay. Reddit is good for the initial PM only. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female that won't cut it for me. If your trans, you can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling it or not. Thanks for understanding * **Switch or Submissive** **Females** \- I don't mind rolling in bed with a woman who likes to take control but more often then not I like to be the alpha in the bedroom. I am not saying NO to dominant woman, just understand my goal is to eventually 'break' you. * **Flexible Age Range** \- Stories often have a variety of characters. Expect to play underage characters in these stories. If you have issues with ageplay we can make them NPC style characters who are present but don't get involved in sex. The more flexible you are the better your chances. * **Multiple Character Stories** \- The stories I write are complex. I often take on a DM/GM role writing the world with multiple characters (I won't say no to a female DM/GMing for me). If you are a player who can only write one character, I mean no offense but my stories are to complex for you. * **Open Book Players** \- I want to get to know you. I will ask you A/S/L, your first name and some other personal questions about who you are. That said, I **WILL NEVER** ask for your phone number, personal email, where you work, or your last name. There are details that can be shared that preserve your anonymity and others that compromise it. I aim to protect you and myself while getting to know you some. * **Quantity and Quality** \- Writing a quality post can be hard. There are various elements that can undermine a post. Repeating what I said in your post and not adding anything new to the scene, god-modding characters (AKA Mary Suing), one-liner responses, and the list goes on. I am willing to invest time and effort into playing with you, I don't think it's unfair for you to do the same with me. * **Voice Chat and Expanded Relationship** \- I love voice chatting with people, like a lewd phone call on Discord where we chat and get passed all the small talk/story prep quickly with our words. If you're open to chatting like this then you get to move to the front of the line. If you want to do other things besides roleplay like play games on Steam, caption pics, or share lewd Tumblr gifs and hentai. You get bonus points for those as well. * **Hard No Kinks** \- I will NOT play ANY of these kinks, I won't kink shame you but having any of these in your prompt history will discourage me from playing: Diapers/Infantilism, Snuff, Mutilation/Nullification, Gore, Obese/Fat/Hyper Fat, Vomiting, Gas/Farting, Blood, Scat, STD's, Popping, Prolapsing, and Toilet Play. If a kink relates to this list then I probably don't want to involve it. # Closing So there you have it my long-winded post to catch quality female players like you.

I like ageplay in my stories (depending on the plot) and so should you. It's not mandatory but if want to up your chances to play with me you need to be OK with this kink. * **Breeding/Pregnancy** \- Not sure when I developed this kink but I love the idea of knocking up my companions. Its the connection that it creates putting a baby in a fertile womb. I am down to explore this kink all the way up to birth, such scenes involving that should happen off-screen. * **Corruption** \- Just like Transformation but changing of the mind. I like moving the dial of the character's morality and personality in a story. My favorite is a Lawful Good male becoming a Deviant Dominating Pervert. He doesn't need to be evil, he just needs to value sex over people. * **Domination** \- I like to be in control in most stories. Master/Slave, Daddy/Daughter, Alpha/Omega and so on. I don't mind stories that involve scenes where I am submissive but there is no chance I will do a plot where I remain that way. Where I don't turn the tables and take control of the woman who thought she was the mistress. * **Harem Play** \- Needless to say I am kind of greedy. I like plots where I claim multiple girls. If you think that's unfair, let me remind you I GM/DM 99% of my stories so the workload is more often then not on my shoulders. If you're willing to play a harem for me, you get to move to the front of the line. * **Incest** \- A family that plays together. Stays together. Incest is not a must but I love to have it appear in most plots. Improve your chances of playing by agreeing to exploring this kink. * **Interracial** \- I love a good mix of skin colors in the bedroom. I love the cultural differences and exploring how people fit. However, if I think you are a real racist; MAGA hat-wearing Neo-Nazi Trump voter. You can properly go fuck yourself. * **Mind Control** \- Closely related to corruption. I love playing with mind control. It can be easy like swinging a gem in front of your face until your under a trance or it can be hard like me slowly reprogramming your mind by altering memories. I enjoy both fantastical snap your fingers mind control and the realistic subliminal music/image approach that takes effect over time. * **Transformation** \- There is something about getting bigger, thicker, stronger, or turning from man to beast that turns me on. I like it when it happens to me. I like it when it happens to you. Most of my stories have TF to varying degrees. # Requirements So now you know about me and you want to grab my attention? There are some elements I think make some female players stand out above their peers and keep me interested. If you check off all or most of the items on this list then I promise you that I will respond to your DM in kind. [Requirements](URL * **Creative/Geeky/Perverted** \- The three cornerstones of a perfect female player. She should be creative enough to run with ideas, geeky enough to lots of canons she can draw inspiration from and perverted enough to get behind my lewd kinks. * **Humorous/Compassionate/Liberal** \- Beyond the three cornerstones for a perfect roleplayer above, I find these personality traits highly desirable. Far too many players with a stick up their ass, mistreating other human beings online and worst of all conservative in their beliefs. * **Playing on Discord** \- I pretty much play exclusively on Discord now. With the private servers, easy image sharing, and being able to edit a post after its sent. It's easily THE BEST way to roleplay. Reddit is good for the initial PM only. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female that won't cut it for me. If your trans, you can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling it or not. Thanks for understanding * **Switch or Submissive** **Females** \- I don't mind rolling in bed with a woman who likes to take control but more often then not I like to be the alpha in the bedroom. I am not saying NO to dominant woman, just understand my goal is to eventually 'break' you. * **Flexible Age Range** \- Stories often have a variety of characters. Expect to play underage characters in these stories. If you have issues with ageplay we can make them NPC style characters who are present but don't get involved in sex. The more flexible you are the better your chances. * **Multiple Character Stories** \- The stories I write are complex. I often take on a DM/GM role writing the world with multiple characters (I won't say no to a female DM/GMing for me). If you are a player who can only write one character, I mean no offense but my stories are to complex for you. * **Open Book Players** \- I want to get to know you. I will ask you A/S/L, your first name and some other personal questions about who you are. That said, I **WILL NEVER** ask for your phone number, personal email, where you work, or your last name. There are details that can be shared that preserve your anonymity and others that compromise it. I aim to protect you and myself while getting to know you some. * **Quantity and Quality** \- Writing a quality post can be hard. There are various elements that can undermine a post. Repeating what I said in your post and not adding anything new to the scene, god-modding characters (AKA Mary Suing), one-liner responses, and the list goes on. I am willing to invest time and effort into playing with you, I don't think it's unfair for you to do the same with me. * **Voice Chat and Expanded Relationship** \- I love voice chatting with people, like a lewd phone call on Discord where we chat and get passed all the small talk/story prep quickly with our words. If you're open to chatting like this then you get to move to the front of the line. If you want to do other things besides roleplay like play games on Steam, caption pics, or share lewd Tumblr gifs and hentai. You get bonus points for those as well. * **Hard No Kinks** \- I will NOT play ANY of these kinks, I won't kink shame you but having any of these in your prompt history will discourage me from playing: Diapers/Infantilism, Snuff, Mutilation/Nullification, Gore, Obese/Fat/Hyper Fat, Vomiting, Gas/Farting, Blood, Scat, STD's, Popping, Prolapsing, and Toilet Play. If a kink relates to this list then I probably don't want to involve it. # Closing So there you have it my long-winded post to catch quality female players like you. Reddit isn't a great space to hunt for female players if only because there are 10 to 1 male to female ratio and lesser males love to downvote other \[M4F\] posts above/below their own. If you have read this full post; Good Job, Gold Star! Shoot me a Message (Reddit chat is hot garbage), if we click well we will move this party to Discord where hopefully we will play for a very very long time.

It's not mandatory but if want to up your chances to play with me you need to be OK with this kink. * **Breeding/Pregnancy** \- Not sure when I developed this kink but I love the idea of knocking up my companions. Its the connection that it creates putting a baby in a fertile womb. I am down to explore this kink all the way up to birth, such scenes involving that should happen off-screen. * **Corruption** \- Just like Transformation but changing of the mind. I like moving the dial of the character's morality and personality in a story. My favorite is a Lawful Good male becoming a Deviant Dominating Pervert. He doesn't need to be evil, he just needs to value sex over people. * **Domination** \- I like to be in control in most stories. Master/Slave, Daddy/Daughter, Alpha/Omega and so on. I don't mind stories that involve scenes where I am submissive but there is no chance I will do a plot where I remain that way. Where I don't turn the tables and take control of the woman who thought she was the mistress. * **Harem Play** \- Needless to say I am kind of greedy. I like plots where I claim multiple girls. If you think that's unfair, let me remind you I GM/DM 99% of my stories so the workload is more often then not on my shoulders. If you're willing to play a harem for me, you get to move to the front of the line. * **Incest** \- A family that plays together. Stays together. Incest is not a must but I love to have it appear in most plots. Improve your chances of playing by agreeing to exploring this kink. * **Interracial** \- I love a good mix of skin colors in the bedroom. I love the cultural differences and exploring how people fit. However, if I think you are a real racist; MAGA hat-wearing Neo-Nazi Trump voter. You can properly go fuck yourself. * **Mind Control** \- Closely related to corruption. I love playing with mind control. It can be easy like swinging a gem in front of your face until your under a trance or it can be hard like me slowly reprogramming your mind by altering memories. I enjoy both fantastical snap your fingers mind control and the realistic subliminal music/image approach that takes effect over time. * **Transformation** \- There is something about getting bigger, thicker, stronger, or turning from man to beast that turns me on. I like it when it happens to me. I like it when it happens to you. Most of my stories have TF to varying degrees. # Requirements So now you know about me and you want to grab my attention? There are some elements I think make some female players stand out above their peers and keep me interested. If you check off all or most of the items on this list then I promise you that I will respond to your DM in kind. [Requirements](URL * **Creative/Geeky/Perverted** \- The three cornerstones of a perfect female player. She should be creative enough to run with ideas, geeky enough to lots of canons she can draw inspiration from and perverted enough to get behind my lewd kinks. * **Humorous/Compassionate/Liberal** \- Beyond the three cornerstones for a perfect roleplayer above, I find these personality traits highly desirable. Far too many players with a stick up their ass, mistreating other human beings online and worst of all conservative in their beliefs. * **Playing on Discord** \- I pretty much play exclusively on Discord now. With the private servers, easy image sharing, and being able to edit a post after its sent. It's easily THE BEST way to roleplay. Reddit is good for the initial PM only. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female that won't cut it for me. If your trans, you can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling it or not. Thanks for understanding * **Switch or Submissive** **Females** \- I don't mind rolling in bed with a woman who likes to take control but more often then not I like to be the alpha in the bedroom. I am not saying NO to dominant woman, just understand my goal is to eventually 'break' you. * **Flexible Age Range** \- Stories often have a variety of characters. Expect to play underage characters in these stories. If you have issues with ageplay we can make them NPC style characters who are present but don't get involved in sex. The more flexible you are the better your chances. * **Multiple Character Stories** \- The stories I write are complex. I often take on a DM/GM role writing the world with multiple characters (I won't say no to a female DM/GMing for me). If you are a player who can only write one character, I mean no offense but my stories are to complex for you. * **Open Book Players** \- I want to get to know you. I will ask you A/S/L, your first name and some other personal questions about who you are. That said, I **WILL NEVER** ask for your phone number, personal email, where you work, or your last name. There are details that can be shared that preserve your anonymity and others that compromise it. I aim to protect you and myself while getting to know you some. * **Quantity and Quality** \- Writing a quality post can be hard. There are various elements that can undermine a post. Repeating what I said in your post and not adding anything new to the scene, god-modding characters (AKA Mary Suing), one-liner responses, and the list goes on. I am willing to invest time and effort into playing with you, I don't think it's unfair for you to do the same with me. * **Voice Chat and Expanded Relationship** \- I love voice chatting with people, like a lewd phone call on Discord where we chat and get passed all the small talk/story prep quickly with our words. If you're open to chatting like this then you get to move to the front of the line. If you want to do other things besides roleplay like play games on Steam, caption pics, or share lewd Tumblr gifs and hentai. You get bonus points for those as well. * **Hard No Kinks** \- I will NOT play ANY of these kinks, I won't kink shame you but having any of these in your prompt history will discourage me from playing: Diapers/Infantilism, Snuff, Mutilation/Nullification, Gore, Obese/Fat/Hyper Fat, Vomiting, Gas/Farting, Blood, Scat, STD's, Popping, Prolapsing, and Toilet Play. If a kink relates to this list then I probably don't want to involve it. # Closing So there you have it my long-winded post to catch quality female players like you. Reddit isn't a great space to hunt for female players if only because there are 10 to 1 male to female ratio and lesser males love to downvote other \[M4F\] posts above/below their own.

I like ageplay in my stories (depending on the plot) and so should you. It's not mandatory but if want to up your chances to play with me you need to be OK with this kink. * **Breeding/Pregnancy** \- Not sure when I developed this kink but I love the idea of knocking up my companions. Its the connection that it creates putting a baby in a fertile womb. I am down to explore this kink all the way up to birth, such scenes involving that should happen off-screen. * **Corruption** \- Just like Transformation but changing of the mind. I like moving the dial of the character's morality and personality in a story. My favorite is a Lawful Good male becoming a Deviant Dominating Pervert. He doesn't need to be evil, he just needs to value sex over people. * **Domination** \- I like to be in control in most stories. Master/Slave, Daddy/Daughter, Alpha/Omega and so on. I don't mind stories that involve scenes where I am submissive but there is no chance I will do a plot where I remain that way. Where I don't turn the tables and take control of the woman who thought she was the mistress. * **Harem Play** \- Needless to say I am kind of greedy. I like plots where I claim multiple girls. If you think that's unfair, let me remind you I GM/DM 99% of my stories so the workload is more often then not on my shoulders. If you're willing to play a harem for me, you get to move to the front of the line. * **Incest** \- A family that plays together. Stays together. Incest is not a must but I love to have it appear in most plots. Improve your chances of playing by agreeing to exploring this kink. * **Interracial** \- I love a good mix of skin colors in the bedroom. I love the cultural differences and exploring how people fit. However, if I think you are a real racist; MAGA hat-wearing Neo-Nazi Trump voter. You can properly go fuck yourself. * **Mind Control** \- Closely related to corruption. I love playing with mind control. It can be easy like swinging a gem in front of your face until your under a trance or it can be hard like me slowly reprogramming your mind by altering memories. I enjoy both fantastical snap your fingers mind control and the realistic subliminal music/image approach that takes effect over time. * **Transformation** \- There is something about getting bigger, thicker, stronger, or turning from man to beast that turns me on. I like it when it happens to me. I like it when it happens to you. Most of my stories have TF to varying degrees. # Requirements So now you know about me and you want to grab my attention? There are some elements I think make some female players stand out above their peers and keep me interested. If you check off all or most of the items on this list then I promise you that I will respond to your DM in kind. [Requirements](URL * **Creative/Geeky/Perverted** \- The three cornerstones of a perfect female player. She should be creative enough to run with ideas, geeky enough to lots of canons she can draw inspiration from and perverted enough to get behind my lewd kinks. * **Humorous/Compassionate/Liberal** \- Beyond the three cornerstones for a perfect roleplayer above, I find these personality traits highly desirable. Far too many players with a stick up their ass, mistreating other human beings online and worst of all conservative in their beliefs. * **Playing on Discord** \- I pretty much play exclusively on Discord now. With the private servers, easy image sharing, and being able to edit a post after its sent. It's easily THE BEST way to roleplay. Reddit is good for the initial PM only. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female that won't cut it for me. If your trans, you can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling it or not. Thanks for understanding * **Switch or Submissive** **Females** \- I don't mind rolling in bed with a woman who likes to take control but more often then not I like to be the alpha in the bedroom. I am not saying NO to dominant woman, just understand my goal is to eventually 'break' you. * **Flexible Age Range** \- Stories often have a variety of characters. Expect to play underage characters in these stories. If you have issues with ageplay we can make them NPC style characters who are present but don't get involved in sex. The more flexible you are the better your chances. * **Multiple Character Stories** \- The stories I write are complex. I often take on a DM/GM role writing the world with multiple characters (I won't say no to a female DM/GMing for me). If you are a player who can only write one character, I mean no offense but my stories are to complex for you. * **Open Book Players** \- I want to get to know you. I will ask you A/S/L, your first name and some other personal questions about who you are. That said, I **WILL NEVER** ask for your phone number, personal email, where you work, or your last name. There are details that can be shared that preserve your anonymity and others that compromise it. I aim to protect you and myself while getting to know you some. * **Quantity and Quality** \- Writing a quality post can be hard. There are various elements that can undermine a post. Repeating what I said in your post and not adding anything new to the scene, god-modding characters (AKA Mary Suing), one-liner responses, and the list goes on. I am willing to invest time and effort into playing with you, I don't think it's unfair for you to do the same with me. * **Voice Chat and Expanded Relationship** \- I love voice chatting with people, like a lewd phone call on Discord where we chat and get passed all the small talk/story prep quickly with our words. If you're open to chatting like this then you get to move to the front of the line. If you want to do other things besides roleplay like play games on Steam, caption pics, or share lewd Tumblr gifs and hentai. You get bonus points for those as well. * **Hard No Kinks** \- I will NOT play ANY of these kinks, I won't kink shame you but having any of these in your prompt history will discourage me from playing: Diapers/Infantilism, Snuff, Mutilation/Nullification, Gore, Obese/Fat/Hyper Fat, Vomiting, Gas/Farting, Blood, Scat, STD's, Popping, Prolapsing, and Toilet Play. If a kink relates to this list then I probably don't want to involve it. # Closing So there you have it my long-winded post to catch quality female players like you. Reddit isn't a great space to hunt for female players if only because there are 10 to 1 male to female ratio and lesser males love to downvote other \[M4F\] posts above/below their own. If you have read this full post; Good Job, Gold Star! Shoot me a Message (Reddit chat is hot garbage), if we click well we will move this party to Discord where hopefully we will play for a very very long time.

I like ageplay in my stories (depending on the plot) and so should you. It's not mandatory but if want to up your chances to play with me you need to be OK with this kink. * **Breeding/Pregnancy** \- Not sure when I developed this kink but I love the idea of knocking up my companions. Its the connection that it creates putting a baby in a fertile womb. I am down to explore this kink all the way up to birth, such scenes involving that should happen off-screen. * **Corruption** \- Just like Transformation but changing of the mind. I like moving the dial of the character's morality and personality in a story. My favorite is a Lawful Good male becoming a Deviant Dominating Pervert. He doesn't need to be evil, he just needs to value sex over people. * **Domination** \- I like to be in control in most stories. Master/Slave, Daddy/Daughter, Alpha/Omega and so on. I don't mind stories that involve scenes where I am submissive but there is no chance I will do a plot where I remain that way. Where I don't turn the tables and take control of the woman who thought she was the mistress. * **Harem Play** \- Needless to say I am kind of greedy. I like plots where I claim multiple girls. If you think that's unfair, let me remind you I GM/DM 99% of my stories so the workload is more often then not on my shoulders. If you're willing to play a harem for me, you get to move to the front of the line. * **Incest** \- A family that plays together. Stays together. Incest is not a must but I love to have it appear in most plots. Improve your chances of playing by agreeing to exploring this kink. * **Interracial** \- I love a good mix of skin colors in the bedroom. I love the cultural differences and exploring how people fit. However, if I think you are a real racist; MAGA hat-wearing Neo-Nazi Trump voter. You can properly go fuck yourself. * **Mind Control** \- Closely related to corruption. I love playing with mind control. It can be easy like swinging a gem in front of your face until your under a trance or it can be hard like me slowly reprogramming your mind by altering memories. I enjoy both fantastical snap your fingers mind control and the realistic subliminal music/image approach that takes effect over time. * **Transformation** \- There is something about getting bigger, thicker, stronger, or turning from man to beast that turns me on. I like it when it happens to me. I like it when it happens to you. Most of my stories have TF to varying degrees. # Requirements So now you know about me and you want to grab my attention? There are some elements I think make some female players stand out above their peers and keep me interested. If you check off all or most of the items on this list then I promise you that I will respond to your DM in kind. [Requirements](URL * **Creative/Geeky/Perverted** \- The three cornerstones of a perfect female player. She should be creative enough to run with ideas, geeky enough to lots of canons she can draw inspiration from and perverted enough to get behind my lewd kinks. * **Humorous/Compassionate/Liberal** \- Beyond the three cornerstones for a perfect roleplayer above, I find these personality traits highly desirable. Far too many players with a stick up their ass, mistreating other human beings online and worst of all conservative in their beliefs. * **Playing on Discord** \- I pretty much play exclusively on Discord now. With the private servers, easy image sharing, and being able to edit a post after its sent. It's easily THE BEST way to roleplay. Reddit is good for the initial PM only. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female that won't cut it for me. If your trans, you can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling it or not. Thanks for understanding * **Switch or Submissive** **Females** \- I don't mind rolling in bed with a woman who likes to take control but more often then not I like to be the alpha in the bedroom. I am not saying NO to dominant woman, just understand my goal is to eventually 'break' you. * **Flexible Age Range** \- Stories often have a variety of characters. Expect to play underage characters in these stories. If you have issues with ageplay we can make them NPC style characters who are present but don't get involved in sex. The more flexible you are the better your chances. * **Multiple Character Stories** \- The stories I write are complex. I often take on a DM/GM role writing the world with multiple characters (I won't say no to a female DM/GMing for me). If you are a player who can only write one character, I mean no offense but my stories are to complex for you. * **Open Book Players** \- I want to get to know you. I will ask you A/S/L, your first name and some other personal questions about who you are. That said, I **WILL NEVER** ask for your phone number, personal email, where you work, or your last name. There are details that can be shared that preserve your anonymity and others that compromise it. I aim to protect you and myself while getting to know you some. * **Quantity and Quality** \- Writing a quality post can be hard. There are various elements that can undermine a post. Repeating what I said in your post and not adding anything new to the scene, god-modding characters (AKA Mary Suing), one-liner responses, and the list goes on. I am willing to invest time and effort into playing with you, I don't think it's unfair for you to do the same with me. * **Voice Chat and Expanded Relationship** \- I love voice chatting with people, like a lewd phone call on Discord where we chat and get passed all the small talk/story prep quickly with our words. If you're open to chatting like this then you get to move to the front of the line. If you want to do other things besides roleplay like play games on Steam, caption pics, or share lewd Tumblr gifs and hentai. You get bonus points for those as well. * **Hard No Kinks** \- I will NOT play ANY of these kinks, I won't kink shame you but having any of these in your prompt history will discourage me from playing: Diapers/Infantilism, Snuff, Mutilation/Nullification, Gore, Obese/Fat/Hyper Fat, Vomiting, Gas/Farting, Blood, Scat, STD's, Popping, Prolapsing, and Toilet Play. If a kink relates to this list then I probably don't want to involve it. # Closing So there you have it my long-winded post to catch quality female players like you. Reddit isn't a great space to hunt for female players if only because there are 10 to 1 male to female ratio and lesser males love to downvote other \[M4F\] posts above/below their own. If you have read this full post; Good Job, Gold Star! Shoot me a Message (Reddit chat is hot garbage), if we click well we will move this party to Discord where hopefully we will play for a very very long time.

Suggest a few of your favorites.\*\*)* # About Me Hey, there my name is **Master of Perversions** or **Perversions** for short. I am a long-time roleplayer who has been writing erotic stories for nearly 20+ years now (weird to say that out loud), so needless to say I am highly experienced and have lots of [lewd ideas](URL I am a 33 Dominant Male Californian; I am over six feet tall, I have muscular/athletic body type (Soccer, Gym, Rock Climbing, Biking), vivid green eyes framed by black glasses and progressive views on the world. I am an open book willing to share some personal details about myself with you (well most details) and I hope you're willing to do the same for me. I keep hitting the fucking character limit on Reddit which is making it hard for me to write all my lewd plots on this profile. So please consider this a tip of the iceberg of what I have to offer and if you have ideas feel free to share, there is a good chance I have character/plot/settings that will complement your work. # Top Desired Stories ^(\*\*Stories are organized alphabetically not in order of most to least desired. \*\*) **Around The World in 80 Lays** \- Based on the story Around the World In 80 Days.

I like ageplay in my stories (depending on the plot) and so should you. It's not mandatory but if want to up your chances to play with me you need to be OK with this kink. * **Breeding/Pregnancy** \- Not sure when I developed this kink but I love the idea of knocking up my companions. Its the connection that it creates putting a baby in a fertile womb. I am down to explore this kink all the way up to birth, such scenes involving that should happen off-screen. * **Corruption** \- Just like Transformation but changing of the mind. I like moving the dial of the character's morality and personality in a story. My favorite is a Lawful Good male becoming a Deviant Dominating Pervert. He doesn't need to be evil, he just needs to value sex over people. * **Domination** \- I like to be in control in most stories. Master/Slave, Daddy/Daughter, Alpha/Omega and so on. I don't mind stories that involve scenes where I am submissive but there is no chance I will do a plot where I remain that way. Where I don't turn the tables and take control of the woman who thought she was the mistress. * **Harem Play** \- Needless to say I am kind of greedy. I like plots where I claim multiple girls. If you think that's unfair, let me remind you I GM/DM 99% of my stories so the workload is more often then not on my shoulders. If you're willing to play a harem for me, you get to move to the front of the line. * **Incest** \- A family that plays together. Stays together. Incest is not a must but I love to have it appear in most plots. Improve your chances of playing by agreeing to exploring this kink. * **Interracial** \- I love a good mix of skin colors in the bedroom. I love the cultural differences and exploring how people fit. However, if I think you are a real racist; MAGA hat-wearing Neo-Nazi Trump voter. You can properly go fuck yourself. * **Mind Control** \- Closely related to corruption. I love playing with mind control. It can be easy like swinging a gem in front of your face until your under a trance or it can be hard like me slowly reprogramming your mind by altering memories. I enjoy both fantastical snap your fingers mind control and the realistic subliminal music/image approach that takes effect over time. * **Transformation** \- There is something about getting bigger, thicker, stronger, or turning from man to beast that turns me on. I like it when it happens to me. I like it when it happens to you. Most of my stories have TF to varying degrees. # Requirements So now you know about me and you want to grab my attention? There are some elements I think make some female players stand out above their peers and keep me interested. If you check off all or most of the items on this list then I promise you that I will respond to your DM in kind. [Requirements](URL * **Creative/Geeky/Perverted** \- The three cornerstones of a perfect female player. She should be creative enough to run with ideas, geeky enough to lots of canons she can draw inspiration from and perverted enough to get behind my lewd kinks. * **Humorous/Compassionate/Liberal** \- Beyond the three cornerstones for a perfect roleplayer above, I find these personality traits highly desirable. Far too many players with a stick up their ass, mistreating other human beings online and worst of all conservative in their beliefs. * **Playing on Discord** \- I pretty much play exclusively on Discord now. With the private servers, easy image sharing, and being able to edit a post after its sent. It's easily THE BEST way to roleplay. Reddit is good for the initial PM only. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female that won't cut it for me. If your trans, you can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling it or not. Thanks for understanding * **Switch or Submissive** **Females** \- I don't mind rolling in bed with a woman who likes to take control but more often then not I like to be the alpha in the bedroom. I am not saying NO to dominant woman, just understand my goal is to eventually 'break' you. * **Flexible Age Range** \- Stories often have a variety of characters. Expect to play underage characters in these stories. If you have issues with ageplay we can make them NPC style characters who are present but don't get involved in sex. The more flexible you are the better your chances. * **Multiple Character Stories** \- The stories I write are complex. I often take on a DM/GM role writing the world with multiple characters (I won't say no to a female DM/GMing for me). If you are a player who can only write one character, I mean no offense but my stories are to complex for you. * **Open Book Players** \- I want to get to know you. I will ask you A/S/L, your first name and some other personal questions about who you are. That said, I **WILL NEVER** ask for your phone number, personal email, where you work, or your last name. There are details that can be shared that preserve your anonymity and others that compromise it. I aim to protect you and myself while getting to know you some. * **Quantity and Quality** \- Writing a quality post can be hard. There are various elements that can undermine a post. Repeating what I said in your post and not adding anything new to the scene, god-modding characters (AKA Mary Suing), one-liner responses, and the list goes on. I am willing to invest time and effort into playing with you, I don't think it's unfair for you to do the same with me. * **Voice Chat and Expanded Relationship** \- I love voice chatting with people, like a lewd phone call on Discord where we chat and get passed all the small talk/story prep quickly with our words. If you're open to chatting like this then you get to move to the front of the line. If you want to do other things besides roleplay like play games on Steam, caption pics, or share lewd Tumblr gifs and hentai. You get bonus points for those as well. * **Hard No Kinks** \- I will NOT play ANY of these kinks, I won't kink shame you but having any of these in your prompt history will discourage me from playing: Diapers/Infantilism, Snuff, Mutilation/Nullification, Gore, Obese/Fat/Hyper Fat, Vomiting, Gas/Farting, Blood, Scat, STD's, Popping, Prolapsing, and Toilet Play. If a kink relates to this list then I probably don't want to involve it. # Closing So there you have it my long-winded post to catch quality female players like you.

I am a long time roleplayer who has been writing erotic stories for nearly 20+ years now, so needless to say I am experienced and have lots of lewd ideas. If you want some more personal info on me. I am a 33 California native, I am over six feet tall, I am in good shape (go to the gym, run, soocer, rock-climb), and I am progressive meaning I respect women but I also am very dominant in the bedroom. I am pretty open book willing to share about myself and I hope to meet partners who feel the same. # Requirements So now you know about me and you want to grab my attention? There are some elements I think make female players stand out above their peers and keep me interested. If you check off all (or most) of the items on this list than you will have me very interested. * **Creative/Geeky/Perverted Female** \- The three corner stones of a perfect female player. She should be creative enough to run with ideas, geeky enough to lots of canon she can draw inspiration from and perverted enough to get behind my lewd kinks. * **Playing on Discord** \- I pretty much play exclusively on Discord now. With the private servers, easy image sharing, and being able to edit a post after its sent. Its easily THE BEST application for roleplay. Reddit is good for initial PM only. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female? That won't cut it for me. If your trans? You can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling a connection or not. Gender, Orientation, and Sexuality is complex. I wont ask you to conform to my sexuality and you shouldn't force me to conform to yours. * **Switch or Submissive** \- I don't mind rolling in bed with a woman who likes to take control but I like to be the dom in the bedroom. I am not saying NO to dominant woman, just understand my goal is to make you mine. * **Flexible Age Range** \- Stories often have a variety of characters differing in age, expect to have underage characters in these stories. If you have issues with ageplay we can make them NPC style characters who are present but don't get involved in sex. The more flexible your age range are the better your chances. * **Multiple Characters** \- The stories I write are... complex. I often take on a DM/GM role writing the world with multiple characters (I wont say no to a female DM/GMing for me). If you are a player who can ONLY write one character, I mean no offense but your skill level isn't high enough to play in these sort of plots.. * **Open Book Players** \- I want to get to know you. I will ask you A/S/L, your first name and some other personal questions about who you are. That said, **I** **WILL NEVER** ask for your phone number, personal email, where you work, or your last name.

Unless we reach that level of trust and respect and decide to get closer. * **Quantity and Quality** \- Writing a quality post can be difficult. There are various elements that can undermine a post. Repeating what I said in your post, not adding anything new to the scene, god modding characters (AKA Mary Suing), one liner responses, and the list goes on. I am willing to invest time and effort into playing with you, I don't think its unfair to ask you to do the same with me. * **Hard No Kinks** \- I will NOT humor ANY of these kinks, I wont shame you but having these any where in your prompt history will discourage me from playing with you: Diapers/Infantilism, Snuff, Mutilation/Nullification, Gore, Obese/Fat/Hyper Fat, Vomiting, Gas/Farting, Blood, Scat, STD's, Popping, Prolapsing, and Toilet Play. If a kink relates to this list then I probably don't want to involve it. # Original Stories **Body Shifters** \- The Body Shifters are a 'female' alien species that live for/crave/eat cum in order to stay healthy. They can alter their bodies at will changing size, shape, color, and clothes at a thought. They are loyal to their human lovers who they feed off of by fucking/sucking all day long. Our story will follow one of this lucky males who gets hooked up with one of these alien babes and trying to keep her a secret while his life becomes one of sex and keeping his alien girls happy. Oh did I mention the more you feed them that they eventually get so big that they split into two new girls? Yeah... that happens. &amp;#x200B; **Castaways** \- A simple plot of either crash landing or being shipwrecked on a deserted island (or planet if Scifi setting). I always liked the concept of being alone and working hard to survive. Of course as a erotic roleplay a guy on a island by himself jerking off is pretty boring, so we are gonna have some girls wash up on that island with him! What will they find on the island? Who knows. Could be amazon tribe, a lost fertility goddess, the fountain of youth, human sized venus fly taps with tentacles, or mind/body altering plants that make us into animals. The possibilities are endless but the premises is always the same. &amp;#x200B; **Dawn of the Breasts** \- Its basically a zombie story only instead of rotting corpses ravaging people, the infected are naked horny and feral bimbos/himbos. No killing needed for this plot all it takes is some cum, breast milk or saliva to start someones inevitable fall to this very sexy disease. Transformation plays a big role here were people take a load and start to put on hyper fertile curves before chasing down their friends and family to turn them as well. There are lots of places to start a story like which makes it highly erotic and versatile. &amp;#x200B; **Dirty Politics** \- A recent idea I been playing with is exploring someones rise to power in the modern political age. He can either be a brilliant politician or have mind control abilities allowing him to get what he needs/wants done quickly. Politically speaking his ideas are often for the best of society and does right by the people but behind closed doors he will make his opponents daughters his own personal sluts to spy on their fathers and help him build a empire of influence under his enemies noses. We may even use famous politicians to do it. &amp;#x200B; **Fertile Valley** \- If you read erotica on the web then you likely came across Fertile Valley. While not every aspect of the original story turned me on the concept of a small secluded town affected by their tainted water supply was something that stuck with me. I am looking for a imagining of this plot with a federal agent moving to the town to find out what the fuck is going on only to have the effects start to alter him and his family. The question is will he stop it before he is too far gone or will he give into the pleasure and embrace the communities incestuous culture? Only one way to find out. &amp;#x200B; **La Resistance** \- A story for all you history lovers out there who love period pieces. La Resistance follows the French Resistance in Paris during WW2. The general plot of the story follows a OSS Operative from the US sent into France to help establish the resistance and help them defeat the Nazis. The team he build will be mostly (if not all) female operatives from various walks of life. I have some characters already created and while French girl is the largest group we also have German, English, Irish, Russian, and American girls among the list of playable characters. If this interests you let me know and I can share what I have written so far. &amp;#x200B; **Man With All The Gifts** \- A relatively generic plot considering all the other stories on the list. I bachelor, father, divorced dad, and/or teacher is given a new lot in life be in magic, miracle pill, alien ray gun, or body altering nanites or whatever. Whatever starts the changes it will allow him to become more over time and eventually make him a demi-god among men. Naturally as any demi-god would do, he starts to claim the women of his life! Coworkers, old girlfriends, ex-wife, daughters, daughters friends, neighbors and so on. It's really a male power fantasy but I find a fair amount of female players wanting to be claimed by a true alpha. An there arnt any bigger alphas than him! &amp;#x200B; **I Love Puazi** \- The Puazi are an alien species who moved to earth to cohabitate with humanity. Thats the general setting in a nutshell. The fun part about the Puazi is their biology makes them really into the smells of earth mammals, primarily humans. The musk makes them sway on their feet, go cross eyed and crave that drug that is a human climax in their mouth. If you don't know the Puazi, I would suggest googling Puazi Incase and getting to know the source material! I promise its worth the read of those lewd comics. &amp;#x200B; **Only We Remain** \- If you get to know me, you will find that I have a deep affection for zombie plots. The scavenging, rebuilding, survival, and fighting create a very compelling plot. Only We Remain (Parodyish title of the Last of Us) follows a alien spore that starts converting men into undead monsters. Its harder to elaborate on then other stories as I have infected types, locations, survivor groups, and the science of infection pretty clearly laid out. If you want a true zombie survival plot that is 2/3rds plots and 1/3rd sex? This is the best plot for you. &amp;#x200B; **Rise of the Wolves** \- Jay Naylor put out a comic called the Fall of Little Red Riding Hood which gave life to that old tale. The Wolves were a tribe and they discovered that humans were quite breedable and made wonderful fleshy lovers. In that vain, I plan to explore the source content more fully writing out a plot of how the Wolves begin to take human settlements and make humanity their literal bitches. Its a wonderful anthro on human story line, it has lots of corruption and even transformation play involved. If you want to get fucked by literal big bad wolfs, this is a good plot for you. &amp;#x200B; **Supernatural Girlfriend AKA My Little Succubus** \- A general story I been working on is slice of life story with Succubus Girlfriend. As I continued to write this setting I started to think about other potential Super Natural Lovers. A Vampire Girlfriend who requires to feed on me from time to time and loves to watch movies all night, a Ghost Girlfriend who is around the time but is never really there, an Orc Girlfriend who is as strong as me and really loves sports but has a temper. Its clever collection of couples in a modern setting exploring how we 'click' as lovers. If you want to play multiple girlfriends I wont say no to such a story, I also have supernatural boyfriends encase you want to be human female with her hung werewolf boyfriend or whatever. &amp;#x200B; **Wincestor House** \- Wincestor House is a basically a haunted mansion or manor that has sexualized ghosts who to fuck the family that moves in. This is easily my most incestuous plot on the list and has things like possession, phantom lovers, flashbacks to other lives, and living objects involved in the plot. I try not to make it a horror movie but nor do I want it to be boring or tame. Its somewhere between House on Haunted Hill, Crimson Peak, Poltergeist and pinch of Casper with a big scoop of porn. I have a primary plot focused on the occult and witchcraft connected to family sex but that plot isnt for everyone so ask me what other options I have if that's not your thing. &amp;#x200B; **Other Originals** \- I have dozens of other plots unposted. Alpha Formula - Chemical turns man into a half man/half wolf beast. Family Farm - A family is turned into beasts of burden on their own farm. Invasion of the Space Futa - Alien Amazons with Cocks invade earth. Master PC - Reality altering PC program changes peoples reality with a few times. And the list goes on. If you have ideas of your own feel free to share, I might have a plot for that. # Canon Stories **The 13 Kingdoms**: *A Disney Story* \- The various Disney Girls reimagined in a interconnected world that plays a lot like with Lord of the Rings with a fair amount of strong female characters. I typically play ""The Big Bad Wolf"" in these stories as a former hero who was twisted by dark powers and now resides in a gray area where he is neither trusted by the Princesses or the Wicked Witches. We can discuss where you might like to take this plot. &amp;#x200B; **Apex**: *A Overwatch Story* \- A new villain called APEX emerges as a nanite infused human who seeks to get revenge on the members of Overwatch and steal their tech. There is no doubt he will enslave them making them into wanton sluts once he has their way with them. Certain characters hold high value like Tracers whos chest plate will allow APEX to distort time. The more he claims the more dangerous he becomes. Will Overwatch and Talon join forces to stop this new foe who seeks to rule the world? &amp;#x200B; **Big Bad Wolf:** *A Witcher Story* \- Geralt is one of the stronger male characters in the past 20 years. I would love to do a simple story with him hunting monsters and having various romantic encounters. If that doesnt scratch your itch he can be corrupted by a perverted mutagen or come down a case of the Werewolfs before breeding Yen, Triss, and Ciri. Please at least know the video games. &amp;#x200B; **Darkest Night**: *A Batman Story* \- Batman isn't terribly interesting but he is fit, smart, rich and in my stories hung. I like a good plot where he is corrupted by Ivy into her equal or a injection from Harley that makes him lose control. The how/why are flexible but what happens after is always the same. He starts to fuck the hell out of the women of Gotham and he takes the best ones back to Wayne Manor to be his harem of super women. &amp;#x200B; **Distant Corners:** *A Star Trek Story* \- I been super eager to meet a female Trekkie who wants to build and OC crew and explore the universe. This is nothing short of an undertaking and we need to be sure we click as players before investing the time and energy into populating a crew. If done right we will have a strong female crew getting into sexy adventures in no time! &amp;#x200B; **Emerging Reality**: *A Marvel/DC Story* \- I been exploring the merging of universes them with Marvel/DC coming together. I even added Overwatch, Lara Croft, Ben 10 and other settings to the same universe. The means changes from the Infinity Stones merging worlds or some other macguffin causing the realities to merge. My favorite character to play is Green Lantern and I have merged him once with Peter Parker making a new character. Super Flexible here with who the lead male can be and where we take the plot. &amp;#x200B; **Fang:** *A Miraculous Story* \- I watched this show with my niece and thought it be fun to write a story where a more dominant older character stepped in and fought crime with Lady Bug. I already settled with this character being a Wolf, about 30 something years old and dominating the fuck out of the school girls in this setting. Expect a very different kind of Miraculous story if you undertake this with me. &amp;#x200B; **The Gray Jedi:** *The Star Wars Story* \- I don't always play Star Wars stories but when I do I am Gray Jedi Master who fucks his padawans. Really though most Star Wars plots are great but I prefer the Old Republic over any other setting. Multiple padwans are desired in this setting. OC characters are great. Canon women are more then welcome. &amp;#x200B; **The King of the North:** *A* *Game of Thrones* \- I do A LOT of retcons on Game of Thrones and 95% of them are saving a hot female from a untimely death. Moving beyond that I usually explore a plot where Jon Snow becomes a dominant stud and starts to build an empire in the North and in the wombs of any woman he see's fit. The means of corruption usually comes from Ygritte shooting some arrows into him only this time the arrows are poisoned and he gets changed by the experience. Does he get bigger and stronger? Just a massive cock? Maybe he turns into Wolf or Dragon? Who knows! Well I do but I mean what do you want from this story. &amp;#x200B; **Lord of Columbia**: *A Bioshock Story* \- Elizabeth from Bioshock might be one of my top 10 females from video games; Lara Croft, Sarah Kerrigan, and Tali'Zorah also make that list. What makes me want to put her on this list? Reality hopping. I love the idea of her teaming up with her Daddy (Booker) and helping him find other versions of her and making them his. Its perverted, incestous and has themes of ageplay, harems, and breeding but I fucking love it. Even more so if he takes Rapture as well. This is pretty much for pervs who love Bioshock as much as me. &amp;#x200B; **Normandy Harem:** *Mass Effect Story* \- There are three avenues to make Shepard become 'evil'. Cerberus Nanites, Collector Parasites, or Reaper Indoctrination Device. I tend to prefer the first option but the result always leads him to fucking the women of the Normandy. Is this plot not your thing? I have ideas for Andromeda and a clone program that makes a bunch of female Shepards. &amp;#x200B; **Symbiote Chronicles**: *A Spider-man Story* \- I find Peter Parker, bit of a Gary Stu. I actually really enjoyed how human they made him in Enter the Spider-Verse. I am getting off track. Point is, I play a more human Spider-man. He's not smarter then Stark, he cant lift two tanks, and he cant shoot a web faster then hammer of a pistol after the trigger is pulled. I am off track again. Spider-Man. Sexual Deviant. Venom Symbiote. Lots of Sex. Mary Jane. Gwen Stacey. Snoo Snoo. You get the idea. &amp;#x200B; **Tongue of the Dragon:** *A Skyrim Story* \- A shelved story idea I been to fucking lazy to finish. Sexy Dragon Shouts. Is it possible? Actually yeah the vocab is there but I haven't spent the time to put together a list of perverted shouts. Shouts that would rip armor off a female warriors body, make a person instantly more submissive or make them susceptible to mind control. It should be noted &amp;#x200B; **Vault Alpha:** *A Fallout Story* \- I have about 10 Vaults I made for the Fallout setting. Hands down my favorite is Vault Alpha also known as a cultural preservation vault. A girls school with a bunch of students from all over the world (including communist China) and their cultures knowledge saved with them. Of course, there was a boys school with same objective but they didn't survive (or did they?) but with the tunnel joining the vaults collapsed they wont find out anytime soon. Its a fun take on Fallout and one I love to explore. If thats not your thing guess what? I got more fucking fallout plots! &amp;#x200B; **Other Canon** \- Honestly the list of games, books, movies, shows, cartoon, anime, and comics goes on forever. Make a list of your favorites from those listed media mediums and present them in conversation. I will let you know which ones I know and are willing to play. I freely admit my anime/manga selection is limited to mostly what comes across Adult Swim. # Generic Stories **Angels &amp; Demons** \- Summoning an Incubus, Hell on Earth with angels and demons fighting for souls, a taboo coupling of angel and demon, and more. I love a good Heaven and Hell story. &amp;#x200B; **Cyber/Bio/Nanopunk** \- I tend to lean towards criminals, hackers, ex-military types, and noir style detectives. I always loved these setting where humanity has blurred the lines between man and machine and began to twist his DNA to suit his needs. &amp;#x200B; **CYOA** \- There are now lewd CYOA's that exist online. If you have something that gets you nice and wet feel free to share. I have a F-list profile dedicated to my collection. &amp;#x200B; **End of the World/Post Apoc** \- Gritty stories where the world has ended by drought, plague, radiation, virus or even the undead. While I would never wish this on humanity it does bring peoples character to the surface. Are you a Criminal? A Survivor? A reluctant hero? A submissive? The end of the world will let you know. &amp;#x200B; **Fantasy** \- Orcs, Centaurs, Elves, and Demons! Oh my! I personally love Conquest plots where kingdoms fall to invaders who take the spoils. Other stories like a demonic curse or princess in hiding also interest me. &amp;#x200B; **Fairy Tales** \- I love a good folk tale! We can keep it in the fantasy setting or shift it to a modern setting. Alternatively I been exploring polytheistic gods in the same lense as Fairy Tales, so if you want to see stories about Zeus. Let me know. &amp;#x200B; **Furries** \- Oh god he rights furry stories as well? Yeah I fucking do. I am a Big Bad Wolf who ruts foxes and bunnies wanna fight about it? &amp;#x200B; **Free Use World** \- A popular choice on Reddit where people are used freely in society for sexual purposes. I can get behind this sort of plot with the right people and in the right setting. Come with a good reason for society become so sexually open. &amp;#x200B; **Holiday** \- Christmas, Halloween, Easter, Etc. I have a profile dedicated to Holiday stories on F-list. I am willing to indulge in the festivities here. If you wanna get fucked in a Halloween costume? I got you. Want to be wrapped in a big bow for Christmas? Of course. Wanna get dominated by an anthro easter bunny? I'm your man. &amp;#x200B; **Incest** \- I have a lewd soft spot for Brother/Sister and Father/Daughter plots myself. Not against Uncle/Niece or Son/Mother either. If a story has family members as characters, I am more than willing to explore those perverted couplings. &amp;#x200B; **Interracial** \- This is a tough one only because racism is still a real thing and I walk this fine line between playing interracial motivated scenes and some stereotypes. There are real bigots online who solely get off on racist scenes and cant separate a short fantasy from respecting and caring for other people in the real world. If you find yourself believe racist beliefs and taking that as you personal social/political view. I am not the man for you. &amp;#x200B; **Military/Spies** \- Gritty settings mostly set in the middle east these days. I enjoy the occasional boots on the ground story where soldiers let off steam while in a secluded base. I admit I added zombies to these military plots a few times. Spies are little more different, located in the cities and focuses on the spy craft itself. &amp;#x200B; **Modern Fantasy** \- Magical wielders hidden in plain sight in the modern world. This includes Elves hiding their ears, vampires in a modern setting, men locking themselves in shipping containers under a full moon, or immortal gods running their own companies. The possibilities are endless. &amp;#x200B; **Monsters** \- I can play a werewolf, incubus, tentacle fiend, or whatever for your personal cravings. Monsters can be fun if done right and unlike most settings it can be done fantasy, modern or scifi no problem. &amp;#x200B; **Slasher** \- Been kicking around the idea of a sexy slasher setting. Big scary 'killer' hunting teens only instead of murdering them he fucks them senseless. Maybe they are fucked so hard they are knocked out for hours or start to like the slasher with that giant cock. I dont know. &amp;#x200B; **Space Opera** \- Space marines, derelict ship with aliens on-board, colonization missions, or just a ragtag crew taking on odd jobs. I love me a good space story! &amp;#x200B; **Steam/Diesel/Atom/Clockpunk** \- A fun setting that I mostly write with furry characters. The main reason why we love these settings? Personal sky ships, fashion and a sense of adventure. Great backdrop for a lewd story. &amp;#x200B; **Super Heroes** \- We can either use canon heroes or make up our own heroes for some super powered sex scenes. I usually play a Batman Esq hero myself but if you want me to fly and fuck you so hard we take down a building I am down. &amp;#x200B; **Supernatural** \- Be it the occult, witchcraft, demons, ancient books or artifacts or whatever. I have a Templar who's managed to survive hundreds of years as a potential champion for the story of our choosing. If you love the Supernatural we can expand on it together. &amp;#x200B; **Toons** \- We all love cartoons and I am more than willing to explore the hundereds of lovely characters given to us in Cartoons. We can write a story with the Power Puff Girls or we can have a plot where we live in a cartoon reality (Like Cool World) where physics are suggestions and the only way to kill a toon is with a eraser. &amp;#x200B; **Westerns** \- I found Westerns are pretty hard plots to get off the ground. When I have written plots like this its mostly bounty hunting or building a homestead with a strong female and her son. I only have a few working ideas for this setting so meet me half way on the brainstorming. &amp;#x200B; **Witches &amp; Warlocks** \- After watching that new Sabrina, witchcraft has been on my mind. If you want to explore a setting that explores Witchcraft be in our modern world or Hogwarts I am down. &amp;#x200B; **Other Settings** \- I probably missed some things like Tron, Gor, Robots, and historical periods. If you have something you like feel free to suggest it. Worse case scenario is me saying ""No Thanks"" and suggesting something else. Be creative and feel free to mix and match ideas like Cyberpunk and Zombies, sounds fucking awesome to me. # Top Kinks * **Ageplay** \- Loli's and Jailbait to Milfs and Dilfs. I like ageplay in my stories (depending on the plot) and so should you. It's not mandatory but if want to up your chances to play with me you need to be ok with this kink. * **Breeding/Pregnancy** \- Not sure when I developed this kink but I love the idea of knocking up my companions. Its the connection that it creates putting a baby in a fertile womb. I am down to explore this kink all the way up to birth, such scenes involving that should happen off screen. * **Corruption** \- Just like Transformation but changing of the mind. I like moving the dial of characters morality and personality in a story. My favorite is a Lawful Good male becoming a Deviant Dominating Pervert. He doesnt need to be evil, he just needs to value sex over people. * **Domination** \- I like to be in control in most stories. Master/Slave, Daddy/Daughter, Alpha/Omega and so on. I dont mind stories that involve scenes where I am submissive but there is no chance I will do a plot where I remain that way. Where I dont turn the tables and take control of the woman who thought she was the mistress. * **Harem Play** \- Needless to say I am kind of greedy. I like plots where I claim multiple girls. If you think thats unfair, let me remind you I GM/DM 99% of my stories so the work load is more often then not on my shoulders. If you're willing to play a harem for me, you get to move to the front of the line. * **Incest** \- A family that plays together. Stays together. Incest is not a must but I love to have it appear in most plots. Improve your chances of playing by agreeing to exploring this kink. * **Interracial** \- I love a good mix of skin colors in the bedroom. I love the cultural differences and exploring how people fit. However, if you I think you are a real racist; MAGA hat wearing Neo Nazi Trump voter. You can go fuck yourself. * **Mind Control** \- Closely related to corruption. I love playing with mind control. It can be easy like swinging a gem in front of your face until your under a trance or it can be hard like me slowly reprogramming your mind by altering memories. I enjoy both fantastical snap your fingers mind control and the realistic subliminal music/image approach that takes effect over time. * **Transformation** \- There is something about getting bigger, thicker, stronger, or turning from man to beast that turns me on. I like it when it happens to me. I like it when it happens to you. Most my stories have TF to varying degrees. # Closing So there you have it my long winded post to catch quality female players like you. Reddit isn't a great space to hunt for female players if only because there are 10 to 1 male to female ratio and lesser males love to downvote other \[M4F\] posts above/below their own. If you have read this full post; Good Job, Gold Star! Shoot me a Message (Reddit chat is hot garbage), if we click well we will move this party to Discord where hopefully we will play for a very very long time. &amp;#x200B; Lewd Regards, **Master of Perversion** ^(P.S.

Suggest a list of your favorites.\*\** # About Me Hey there my name is **Master of Perversions** or **Perversions** for short. I am a long time roleplayer who has been writing erotic stories for nearly 20+ years now, so needless to say I am experienced and have lots of lewd ideas. If you want some more personal info on me. I am a 33 California native, I am over six feet tall, I am in good shape (go to the gym, run, soccer, rock-climb), and I am progressive meaning I respect women but I also am very dominant in the bedroom. I am pretty open book willing to share about myself and I hope to meet partners who feel the same. # Requirements So now you know about me and you want to grab my attention? There are some elements I think make female players stand out above their peers and keep me interested. If you check off all (or most) of the items on this list than you will have me very interested. * **Creative/Geeky/Perverted Female** \- The three cornerstones of a perfect female player. She should be creative enough to run with ideas, geeky enough to lots of canon she can draw inspiration from and perverted enough to get behind my lewd kinks. * **Playing on Discord** \- I pretty much play exclusively on Discord now. With the private servers, easy image sharing, and being able to edit a post after its sent. It's easily THE BEST application for roleplay. Reddit is good for initial PM only. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female? That won't cut it for me. If your trans? You can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling a connection or not. Gender, Orientation, and Sexuality is complex. I won't ask you to conform to my sexuality and you shouldn't force me to conform to yours. * **Switch or Submissive** \- I don't mind rolling in bed with a woman who likes to take control but I like to be the dom in the bedroom. I am not saying NO to dominant woman, just understand my goal is to make you mine. * **Flexible Age Range** \- Stories often have a variety of characters differing in age, expect to have underage characters in these stories. If you have issues with ageplay we can make them NPC style characters who are present but don't get involved in sex. The more flexible your age range are the better your chances. * **Multiple Characters** \- The stories I write are... complex. I often take on a DM/GM role writing the world with multiple characters (I wont say no to a female DM/GMing for me). If you are a player who can ONLY write one character, I mean no offense but your skill level isn't high enough to play in these sort of plots.. * **Open Book Players** \- I want to get to know you. I will ask you A/S/L, your first name and some other personal questions about who you are. That said, **I** **WILL NEVER** ask for your phone number, personal email, where you work, or your last name. There are details that can be shared that preserve your anonymity online and others that compromise it. I aim to protect you (and myself) asking things that wont give away who you truly are. Unless we reach that level of trust and respect and decide to get closer. * **Quantity and Quality** \- Writing a quality post can be difficult. There are various elements that can undermine a post. Repeating what I said in your post, not adding anything new to the scene, god modding characters (AKA Mary Suing), one liner responses, and the list goes on. I am willing to invest time and effort into playing with you, I don't think its unfair to ask you to do the same with me. * **Hard No Kinks** \- I will NOT humor ANY of these kinks, I wont shame you but having these any where in your prompt history will discourage me from playing with you: Diapers/Infantilism, Snuff, Mutilation/Nullification, Gore, Obese/Fat/Hyper Fat, Vomiting, Gas/Farting, Blood, Scat, STD's, Popping, Prolapsing, and Toilet Play. If a kink relates to this list then I probably don't want to involve it. # Original Stories **Body Shifters** \- The Body Shifters are a 'female' alien species that live for/crave/eat cum in order to stay healthy. They can alter their bodies at will changing size, shape, color, and clothes at a thought. They are loyal to their human lovers who they feed off of by fucking/sucking all day long. Our story will follow one of this lucky males who gets hooked up with one of these alien babes and trying to keep her a secret while his life becomes one of sex and keeping his alien girls happy. Oh did I mention the more you feed them that they eventually get so big that they split into two new girls? Yeah... that happens. &amp;#x200B; **Castaways** \- A simple plot of either crash landing or being shipwrecked on a deserted island (or planet if Scifi setting). I always liked the concept of being alone and working hard to survive. Of course, as a erotic roleplay a guy on a island by himself jerking off is pretty boring, so we are gonna have some girls wash up on that island with him! What will they find on the island? Who knows. Could be amazon tribe, a lost fertility goddess, the fountain of youth, human sized venus fly taps with tentacles, or mind/body altering plants that make us into animals. The possibilities are endless but the premises is always the same. &amp;#x200B; **Dawn of the Breasts** \- Its basically a zombie story only instead of rotting corpses ravaging people, the infected are naked horny and feral bimbos/himbos. No killing needed for this plot all it takes is some cum, breast milk or saliva to start someones inevitable fall to this very sexy disease. Transformation plays a big role here were people take a load and start to put on hyper fertile curves before chasing down their friends and family to turn them as well. There are lots of places to start a story like which makes it highly erotic and versatile. &amp;#x200B; **Dirty Politics** \- A recent idea I been playing with is exploring someone's rise to power in the modern political age. He can either be a brilliant politician or have mind control abilities allowing him to get what he needs/wants done quickly. Politically speaking his ideas are often for the best of society and does right by the people but behind closed doors he will make his opponents daughters his own personal sluts to spy on their fathers and help him build a empire of influence under his enemies noses. We may even use famous politicians to do it. &amp;#x200B; **Fertile Valley** \- If you read erotica on the web then you likely came across Fertile Valley. While not every aspect of the original story turned me on the concept of a small secluded town affected by their tainted water supply was something that stuck with me. I am looking for a imagining of this plot with a federal agent moving to the town to find out what the fuck is going on only to have the effects start to alter him and his family. The question is will he stop it before he is too far gone or will he give into the pleasure and embrace the communities incestuous culture? Only one way to find out. &amp;#x200B; **La Resistance** \- A story for all you history lovers out there who love period pieces. La Resistance follows the French Resistance in Paris during WW2. The general plot of the story follows a OSS Operative from the US sent into France to help establish the resistance and help them defeat the Nazis. The team he build will be mostly (if not all) female operatives from various walks of life. I have some characters already created and while French girl is the largest group we also have German, English, Irish, Russian, and American girls among the list of playable characters. If this interests you let me know and I can share what I have written so far. &amp;#x200B; **Man With All The Gifts** \- A relatively generic plot considering all the other stories on the list. I bachelor, father, divorced dad, and/or teacher is given a new lot in life be in magic, miracle pill, alien ray gun, or body altering nanites or whatever. Whatever starts the changes it will allow him to become more over time and eventually make him a demi-god among men. Naturally as any demi-god would do, he starts to claim the women of his life! Coworkers, old girlfriends, ex-wife, daughters, daughters friends, neighbors and so on. It's really a male power fantasy but I find a fair amount of female players wanting to be claimed by a true alpha. An there arnt any bigger alphas than him! &amp;#x200B; **I Love Puazi** \- The Puazi are an alien species who moved to earth to cohabitate with humanity. Thats the general setting in a nutshell. The fun part about the Puazi is their biology makes them really into the smells of earth mammals, primarily humans. The musk makes them sway on their feet, go cross eyed and crave that drug that is a human climax in their mouth. If you don't know the Puazi, I would suggest googling Puazi Incase and getting to know the source material! I promise its worth the read of those lewd comics. &amp;#x200B; **Only We Remain** \- If you get to know me, you will find that I have a deep affection for zombie plots. The scavenging, rebuilding, survival, and fighting create a very compelling plot. Only We Remain (Parodyish title of the Last of Us) follows a alien spore that starts converting men into undead monsters. Its harder to elaborate on then other stories as I have infected types, locations, survivor groups, and the science of infection pretty clearly laid out. If you want a true zombie survival plot that is 2/3rds plots and 1/3rd sex? This is the best plot for you. &amp;#x200B; **Rise of the Wolves** \- Jay Naylor put out a comic called the Fall of Little Red Riding Hood which gave life to that old tale. The Wolves were a tribe and they discovered that humans were quite breedable and made wonderful fleshy lovers. In that vain, I plan to explore the source content more fully writing out a plot of how the Wolves begin to take human settlements and make humanity their literal bitches. Its a wonderful anthro on human story line, it has lots of corruption and even transformation play involved. If you want to get fucked by literal big bad wolfs, this is a good plot for you. &amp;#x200B; **Supernatural Girlfriend AKA My Little Succubus** \- A general story I been working on is slice of life story with Succubus Girlfriend. As I continued to write this setting I started to think about other potential Super Natural Lovers. A Vampire Girlfriend who requires to feed on me from time to time and loves to watch movies all night, a Ghost Girlfriend who is around the time but is never really there, an Orc Girlfriend who is as strong as me and really loves sports but has a temper. Its clever collection of couples in a modern setting exploring how we 'click' as lovers. If you want to play multiple girlfriends I wont say no to such a story, I also have supernatural boyfriends encase you want to be human female with her hung werewolf boyfriend or whatever. &amp;#x200B; **Wincestor House** \- Wincestor House is a basically a haunted mansion or manor that has sexualized ghosts who to fuck the family that moves in. This is easily my most incestuous plot on the list and has things like possession, phantom lovers, flashbacks to other lives, and living objects involved in the plot. I try not to make it a horror movie but nor do I want it to be boring or tame. Its somewhere between House on Haunted Hill, Crimson Peak, Poltergeist and pinch of Casper with a big scoop of porn. I have a primary plot focused on the occult and witchcraft connected to family sex but that plot isnt for everyone so ask me what other options I have if that's not your thing. &amp;#x200B; **Other Originals** \- I have dozens of other plots unposted. Alpha Formula - Chemical turns man into a half man/half wolf beast. Family Farm - A family is turned into beasts of burden on their own farm. Invasion of the Space Futa - Alien Amazons with Cocks invade earth. Master PC - Reality altering PC program changes peoples reality with a few times. And the list goes on. If you have ideas of your own feel free to share, I might have a plot for that. # Canon Stories **The 13 Kingdoms**: *A Disney Story* \- The various Disney Girls reimagined in a interconnected world that plays a lot like with Lord of the Rings with a fair amount of strong female characters. I typically play ""The Big Bad Wolf"" in these stories as a former hero who was twisted by dark powers and now resides in a gray area where he is neither trusted by the Princesses or the Wicked Witches. We can discuss where you might like to take this plot. &amp;#x200B; **Apex**: *A Overwatch Story* \- A new villain called APEX emerges as a nanite infused human who seeks to get revenge on the members of Overwatch and steal their tech. There is no doubt he will enslave them making them into wanton sluts once he has their way with them. Certain characters hold high value like Tracers whos chest plate will allow APEX to distort time. The more he claims the more dangerous he becomes. Will Overwatch and Talon join forces to stop this new foe who seeks to rule the world? &amp;#x200B; **Big Bad Wolf:** *A Witcher Story* \- Geralt is one of the stronger male characters in the past 20 years. I would love to do a simple story with him hunting monsters and having various romantic encounters. If that doesnt scratch your itch he can be corrupted by a perverted mutagen or come down a case of the Werewolfs before breeding Yen, Triss, and Ciri. Please at least know the video games. &amp;#x200B; **Darkest Night**: *A Batman Story* \- Batman isn't terribly interesting but he is fit, smart, rich and in my stories hung. I like a good plot where he is corrupted by Ivy into her equal or a injection from Harley that makes him lose control. The how/why are flexible but what happens after is always the same. He starts to fuck the hell out of the women of Gotham and he takes the best ones back to Wayne Manor to be his harem of super women. &amp;#x200B; **Distant Corners:** *A Star Trek Story* \- I been super eager to meet a female Trekkie who wants to build and OC crew and explore the universe. This is nothing short of an undertaking and we need to be sure we click as players before investing the time and energy into populating a crew. If done right we will have a strong female crew getting into sexy adventures in no time! &amp;#x200B; **Emerging Reality**: *A Marvel/DC Story* \- I been exploring the merging of universes them with Marvel/DC coming together. I even added Overwatch, Lara Croft, Ben 10 and other settings to the same universe. The means changes from the Infinity Stones merging worlds or some other macguffin causing the realities to merge. My favorite character to play is Green Lantern and I have merged him once with Peter Parker making a new character. Super Flexible here with who the lead male can be and where we take the plot. &amp;#x200B; **Fang:** *A Miraculous Story* \- I watched this show with my niece and thought it be fun to write a story where a more dominant older character stepped in and fought crime with Lady Bug. I already settled with this character being a Wolf, about 30 something years old and dominating the fuck out of the school girls in this setting. Expect a very different kind of Miraculous story if you undertake this with me. &amp;#x200B; **The Gray Jedi:** *The Star Wars Story* \- I don't always play Star Wars stories but when I do I am Gray Jedi Master who fucks his padawans. Really though most Star Wars plots are great but I prefer the Old Republic over any other setting. Multiple padwans are desired in this setting. OC characters are great. Canon women are more then welcome. &amp;#x200B; **The King of the North:** *A* *Game of Thrones* \- I do A LOT of retcons on Game of Thrones and 95% of them are saving a hot female from a untimely death. Moving beyond that I usually explore a plot where Jon Snow becomes a dominant stud and starts to build an empire in the North and in the wombs of any woman he see's fit. The means of corruption usually comes from Ygritte shooting some arrows into him only this time the arrows are poisoned and he gets changed by the experience. Does he get bigger and stronger? Just a massive cock? Maybe he turns into Wolf or Dragon? Who knows! Well I do but I mean what do you want from this story. &amp;#x200B; **Lord of Columbia**: *A Bioshock Story* \- Elizabeth from Bioshock might be one of my top 10 females from video games; Lara Croft, Sarah Kerrigan, and Tali'Zorah also make that list. What makes me want to put her on this list? Reality hopping. I love the idea of her teaming up with her Daddy (Booker) and helping him find other versions of her and making them his. Its perverted, incestous and has themes of ageplay, harems, and breeding but I fucking love it. Even more so if he takes Rapture as well. This is pretty much for pervs who love Bioshock as much as me. &amp;#x200B; **Normandy Harem:** *Mass Effect Story* \- There are three avenues to make Shepard become 'evil'. Cerberus Nanites, Collector Parasites, or Reaper Indoctrination Device. I tend to prefer the first option but the result always leads him to fucking the women of the Normandy. Is this plot not your thing? I have ideas for Andromeda and a clone program that makes a bunch of female Shepards. &amp;#x200B; **Symbiote Chronicles**: *A Spider-man Story* \- I find Peter Parker, bit of a Gary Stu. I actually really enjoyed how human they made him in Enter the Spider-Verse. I am getting off track. Point is, I play a more human Spider-man. He's not smarter then Stark, he cant lift two tanks, and he cant shoot a web faster then hammer of a pistol after the trigger is pulled. I am off track again. Spider-Man. Sexual Deviant. Venom Symbiote. Lots of Sex. Mary Jane. Gwen Stacey. Snoo Snoo. You get the idea. &amp;#x200B; **Tongue of the Dragon:** *A Skyrim Story* \- A shelved story idea I been to fucking lazy to finish. Sexy Dragon Shouts. Is it possible? Actually yeah the vocab is there but I haven't spent the time to put together a list of perverted shouts. Shouts that would rip armor off a female warriors body, make a person instantly more submissive or make them susceptible to mind control. It should be noted &amp;#x200B; **Vault Alpha:** *A Fallout Story* \- I have about 10 Vaults I made for the Fallout setting. Hands down my favorite is Vault Alpha also known as a cultural preservation vault. A girls school with a bunch of students from all over the world (including communist China) and their cultures knowledge saved with them. Of course, there was a boys school with same objective but they didn't survive (or did they?) but with the tunnel joining the vaults collapsed they wont find out anytime soon. Its a fun take on Fallout and one I love to explore. If thats not your thing guess what? I got more fucking fallout plots! &amp;#x200B; **Other Canon** \- Honestly the list of games, books, movies, shows, cartoon, anime, and comics goes on forever. Make a list of your favorites from those listed media mediums and present them in conversation. I will let you know which ones I know and are willing to play. I freely admit my anime/manga selection is limited to mostly what comes across Adult Swim. # Generic Stories **Angels &amp; Demons** \- Summoning an Incubus, Hell on Earth with angels and demons fighting for souls, a taboo coupling of angel and demon, and more. I love a good Heaven and Hell story. &amp;#x200B; **Cyber/Bio/Nanopunk** \- I tend to lean towards criminals, hackers, ex-military types, and noir style detectives. I always loved these setting where humanity has blurred the lines between man and machine and began to twist his DNA to suit his needs. &amp;#x200B; **CYOA** \- There are now lewd CYOA's that exist online. If you have something that gets you nice and wet feel free to share. I have a F-list profile dedicated to my collection. &amp;#x200B; **End of the World/Post Apoc** \- Gritty stories where the world has ended by drought, plague, radiation, virus or even the undead. While I would never wish this on humanity it does bring peoples character to the surface. Are you a Criminal? A Survivor? A reluctant hero? A submissive? The end of the world will let you know. &amp;#x200B; **Fantasy** \- Orcs, Centaurs, Elves, and Demons! Oh my! I personally love Conquest plots where kingdoms fall to invaders who take the spoils. Other stories like a demonic curse or princess in hiding also interest me. &amp;#x200B; **Fairy Tales** \- I love a good folk tale! We can keep it in the fantasy setting or shift it to a modern setting. Alternatively I been exploring polytheistic gods in the same lense as Fairy Tales, so if you want to see stories about Zeus. Let me know. &amp;#x200B; **Furries** \- Oh god he rights furry stories as well? Yeah I fucking do. I am a Big Bad Wolf who ruts foxes and bunnies wanna fight about it? &amp;#x200B; **Free Use World** \- A popular choice on Reddit where people are used freely in society for sexual purposes. I can get behind this sort of plot with the right people and in the right setting. Come with a good reason for society become so sexually open. &amp;#x200B; **Holiday** \- Christmas, Halloween, Easter, Etc. I have a profile dedicated to Holiday stories on F-list. I am willing to indulge in the festivities here. If you wanna get fucked in a Halloween costume? I got you. Want to be wrapped in a big bow for Christmas? Of course. Wanna get dominated by an anthro easter bunny? I'm your man. &amp;#x200B; **Incest** \- I have a lewd soft spot for Brother/Sister and Father/Daughter plots myself. Not against Uncle/Niece or Son/Mother either. If a story has family members as characters, I am more than willing to explore those perverted couplings. &amp;#x200B; **Interracial** \- This is a tough one only because racism is still a real thing and I walk this fine line between playing interracial motivated scenes and some stereotypes. There are real bigots online who solely get off on racist scenes and cant separate a short fantasy from respecting and caring for other people in the real world. If you find yourself believe racist beliefs and taking that as you personal social/political view. I am not the man for you. &amp;#x200B; **Military/Spies** \- Gritty settings mostly set in the middle east these days. I enjoy the occasional boots on the ground story where soldiers let off steam while in a secluded base. I admit I added zombies to these military plots a few times. Spies are little more different, located in the cities and focuses on the spy craft itself. &amp;#x200B; **Modern Fantasy** \- Magical wielders hidden in plain sight in the modern world. This includes Elves hiding their ears, vampires in a modern setting, men locking themselves in shipping containers under a full moon, or immortal gods running their own companies. The possibilities are endless. &amp;#x200B; **Monsters** \- I can play a werewolf, incubus, tentacle fiend, or whatever for your personal cravings. Monsters can be fun if done right and unlike most settings it can be done fantasy, modern or scifi no problem. &amp;#x200B; **Slasher** \- Been kicking around the idea of a sexy slasher setting. Big scary 'killer' hunting teens only instead of murdering them he fucks them senseless. Maybe they are fucked so hard they are knocked out for hours or start to like the slasher with that giant cock. I dont know. &amp;#x200B; **Space Opera** \- Space marines, derelict ship with aliens on-board, colonization missions, or just a ragtag crew taking on odd jobs. I love me a good space story! &amp;#x200B; **Steam/Diesel/Atom/Clockpunk** \- A fun setting that I mostly write with furry characters. The main reason why we love these settings? Personal sky ships, fashion and a sense of adventure. Great backdrop for a lewd story. &amp;#x200B; **Super Heroes** \- We can either use canon heroes or make up our own heroes for some super powered sex scenes. I usually play a Batman Esq hero myself but if you want me to fly and fuck you so hard we take down a building I am down. &amp;#x200B; **Supernatural** \- Be it the occult, witchcraft, demons, ancient books or artifacts or whatever. I have a Templar who's managed to survive hundreds of years as a potential champion for the story of our choosing. If you love the Supernatural we can expand on it together. &amp;#x200B; **Toons** \- We all love cartoons and I am more than willing to explore the hundereds of lovely characters given to us in Cartoons. We can write a story with the Power Puff Girls or we can have a plot where we live in a cartoon reality (Like Cool World) where physics are suggestions and the only way to kill a toon is with a eraser. &amp;#x200B; **Westerns** \- I found Westerns are pretty hard plots to get off the ground. When I have written plots like this its mostly bounty hunting or building a homestead with a strong female and her son. I only have a few working ideas for this setting so meet me half way on the brainstorming. &amp;#x200B; **Witches &amp; Warlocks** \- After watching that new Sabrina, witchcraft has been on my mind. If you want to explore a setting that explores Witchcraft be in our modern world or Hogwarts I am down. &amp;#x200B; **Other Settings** \- I probably missed some things like Tron, Gor, Robots, and historical periods. If you have something you like feel free to suggest it. Worse case scenario is me saying ""No Thanks"" and suggesting something else. Be creative and feel free to mix and match ideas like Cyberpunk and Zombies, sounds fucking awesome to me. # Top Kinks * **Ageplay** \- Loli's and Jailbait to Milfs and Dilfs. I like ageplay in my stories (depending on the plot) and so should you. It's not mandatory but if want to up your chances to play with me you need to be ok with this kink. * **Breeding/Pregnancy** \- Not sure when I developed this kink but I love the idea of knocking up my companions. Its the connection that it creates putting a baby in a fertile womb. I am down to explore this kink all the way up to birth, such scenes involving that should happen off screen. * **Corruption** \- Just like Transformation but changing of the mind. I like moving the dial of characters morality and personality in a story. My favorite is a Lawful Good male becoming a Deviant Dominating Pervert. He doesnt need to be evil, he just needs to value sex over people. * **Domination** \- I like to be in control in most stories. Master/Slave, Daddy/Daughter, Alpha/Omega and so on. I dont mind stories that involve scenes where I am submissive but there is no chance I will do a plot where I remain that way. Where I dont turn the tables and take control of the woman who thought she was the mistress. * **Harem Play** \- Needless to say I am kind of greedy. I like plots where I claim multiple girls. If you think thats unfair, let me remind you I GM/DM 99% of my stories so the work load is more often then not on my shoulders. If you're willing to play a harem for me, you get to move to the front of the line. * **Incest** \- A family that plays together. Stays together. Incest is not a must but I love to have it appear in most plots. Improve your chances of playing by agreeing to exploring this kink. * **Interracial** \- I love a good mix of skin colors in the bedroom. I love the cultural differences and exploring how people fit. However, if you I think you are a real racist; MAGA hat wearing Neo-Nazi Trump voter. You can go fuck yourself. * **Mind Control** \- Closely related to corruption. I love playing with mind control. It can be easy like swinging a gem in front of your face until your under a trance or it can be hard like me slowly reprogramming your mind by altering memories. I enjoy both fantastical snap your fingers mind control and the realistic subliminal music/image approach that takes effect over time. * **Transformation** \- There is something about getting bigger, thicker, stronger, or turning from man to beast that turns me on. I like it when it happens to me. I like it when it happens to you. Most my stories have TF to varying degrees. # Closing So there you have it my long winded post to catch quality female players like you. Reddit isn't a great space to hunt for female players if only because there are 10 to 1 male to female ratio and lesser males love to downvote other \[M4F\] posts above/below their own. If you have read this full post; Good Job, Gold Star! Shoot me a Message (Reddit chat is hot garbage), if we click well we will move this party to Discord where hopefully we will play for a very very long time. &amp;#x200B; Lewd Regards, **Master of Perversion** ^(P.S.

Suggest a list of your favorites.\*\** # About Me Hey there my name is **Master of Perversions** or **Perversions** for short. I am a long time roleplayer who has been writing erotic stories for nearly 20+ years now, so needless to say I am experienced and have lots of lewd ideas. If you want some more personal info on me. I am a 33 California native, I am over six feet tall, I am in good shape (go to the gym, run, soccer, rock-climb), and I am progressive meaning I respect women but I also am very dominant in the bedroom. I am pretty open book willing to share about myself and I hope to meet partners who feel the same. # Requirements So now you know about me and you want to grab my attention? There are some elements I think make female players stand out above their peers and keep me interested. If you check off all (or most) of the items on this list than you will have me very interested. * **Creative/Geeky/Perverted Female** \- The three cornerstones of a perfect female player. She should be creative enough to run with ideas, geeky enough to lots of canon she can draw inspiration from and perverted enough to get behind my lewd kinks. * **Playing on Discord** \- I pretty much play exclusively on Discord now. With the private servers, easy image sharing, and being able to edit a post after its sent. It's easily THE BEST application for roleplay. Reddit is good for initial PM only. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female? That won't cut it for me. If your trans? You can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling a connection or not. Gender, Orientation, and Sexuality is complex. I won't ask you to conform to my sexuality and you shouldn't force me to conform to yours. * **Switch or Submissive** \- I don't mind rolling in bed with a woman who likes to take control but I like to be the dom in the bedroom. I am not saying NO to dominant woman, just understand my goal is to make you mine. * **Flexible Age Range** \- Stories often have a variety of characters differing in age, expect to have underage characters in these stories. If you have issues with ageplay we can make them NPC style characters who are present but don't get involved in sex. The more flexible your age range are the better your chances. * **Multiple Characters** \- The stories I write are... complex. I often take on a DM/GM role writing the world with multiple characters (I wont say no to a female DM/GMing for me). If you are a player who can ONLY write one character, I mean no offense but your skill level isn't high enough to play in these sort of plots.. * **Open Book Players** \- I want to get to know you. I will ask you A/S/L, your first name and some other personal questions about who you are. That said, **I** **WILL NEVER** ask for your phone number, personal email, where you work, or your last name. There are details that can be shared that preserve your anonymity online and others that compromise it. I aim to protect you (and myself) asking things that wont give away who you truly are. Unless we reach that level of trust and respect and decide to get closer. * **Quantity and Quality** \- Writing a quality post can be difficult. There are various elements that can undermine a post. Repeating what I said in your post, not adding anything new to the scene, god modding characters (AKA Mary Suing), one liner responses, and the list goes on. I am willing to invest time and effort into playing with you, I don't think its unfair to ask you to do the same with me. * **Hard No Kinks** \- I will NOT humor ANY of these kinks, I wont shame you but having these any where in your prompt history will discourage me from playing with you: Diapers/Infantilism, Snuff, Mutilation/Nullification, Gore, Obese/Fat/Hyper Fat, Vomiting, Gas/Farting, Blood, Scat, STD's, Popping, Prolapsing, and Toilet Play. If a kink relates to this list then I probably don't want to involve it. # Original Stories **Body Shifters** \- The Body Shifters are a 'female' alien species that live for/crave/eat cum in order to stay healthy. They can alter their bodies at will changing size, shape, color, and clothes at a thought. They are loyal to their human lovers who they feed off of by fucking/sucking all day long. Our story will follow one of this lucky males who gets hooked up with one of these alien babes and trying to keep her a secret while his life becomes one of sex and keeping his alien girls happy. Oh did I mention the more you feed them that they eventually get so big that they split into two new girls? Yeah... that happens. &amp;#x200B; **Castaways** \- A simple plot of either crash landing or being shipwrecked on a deserted island (or planet if Scifi setting). I always liked the concept of being alone and working hard to survive. Of course, as a erotic roleplay a guy on a island by himself jerking off is pretty boring, so we are gonna have some girls wash up on that island with him! What will they find on the island? Who knows. Could be amazon tribe, a lost fertility goddess, the fountain of youth, human sized venus fly taps with tentacles, or mind/body altering plants that make us into animals. The possibilities are endless but the premises is always the same. &amp;#x200B; **Dawn of the Breasts** \- Its basically a zombie story only instead of rotting corpses ravaging people, the infected are naked horny and feral bimbos/himbos. No killing needed for this plot all it takes is some cum, breast milk or saliva to start someones inevitable fall to this very sexy disease. Transformation plays a big role here were people take a load and start to put on hyper fertile curves before chasing down their friends and family to turn them as well. There are lots of places to start a story like which makes it highly erotic and versatile. &amp;#x200B; **Dirty Politics** \- A recent idea I been playing with is exploring someone's rise to power in the modern political age. He can either be a brilliant politician or have mind control abilities allowing him to get what he needs/wants done quickly. Politically speaking his ideas are often for the best of society and does right by the people but behind closed doors he will make his opponents daughters his own personal sluts to spy on their fathers and help him build a empire of influence under his enemies noses. We may even use famous politicians to do it. &amp;#x200B; **Fertile Valley** \- If you read erotica on the web then you likely came across Fertile Valley. While not every aspect of the original story turned me on the concept of a small secluded town affected by their tainted water supply was something that stuck with me. I am looking for a imagining of this plot with a federal agent moving to the town to find out what the fuck is going on only to have the effects start to alter him and his family. The question is will he stop it before he is too far gone or will he give into the pleasure and embrace the communities incestuous culture? Only one way to find out. &amp;#x200B; **La Resistance** \- A story for all you history lovers out there who love period pieces. La Resistance follows the French Resistance in Paris during WW2. The general plot of the story follows a OSS Operative from the US sent into France to help establish the resistance and help them defeat the Nazis. The team he build will be mostly (if not all) female operatives from various walks of life. I have some characters already created and while French girl is the largest group we also have German, English, Irish, Russian, and American girls among the list of playable characters. If this interests you let me know and I can share what I have written so far. &amp;#x200B; **Man With All The Gifts** \- A relatively generic plot considering all the other stories on the list. I bachelor, father, divorced dad, and/or teacher is given a new lot in life be in magic, miracle pill, alien ray gun, or body altering nanites or whatever. Whatever starts the changes it will allow him to become more over time and eventually make him a demi-god among men. Naturally as any demi-god would do, he starts to claim the women of his life! Coworkers, old girlfriends, ex-wife, daughters, daughters friends, neighbors and so on. It's really a male power fantasy but I find a fair amount of female players wanting to be claimed by a true alpha. An there arnt any bigger alphas than him! &amp;#x200B; **I Love Puazi** \- The Puazi are an alien species who moved to earth to cohabitate with humanity. Thats the general setting in a nutshell. The fun part about the Puazi is their biology makes them really into the smells of earth mammals, primarily humans. The musk makes them sway on their feet, go cross eyed and crave that drug that is a human climax in their mouth. If you don't know the Puazi, I would suggest googling Puazi Incase and getting to know the source material! I promise its worth the read of those lewd comics. &amp;#x200B; **Only We Remain** \- If you get to know me, you will find that I have a deep affection for zombie plots. The scavenging, rebuilding, survival, and fighting create a very compelling plot. Only We Remain (Parodyish title of the Last of Us) follows a alien spore that starts converting men into undead monsters. Its harder to elaborate on then other stories as I have infected types, locations, survivor groups, and the science of infection pretty clearly laid out. If you want a true zombie survival plot that is 2/3rds plots and 1/3rd sex? This is the best plot for you. &amp;#x200B; **Rise of the Wolves** \- Jay Naylor put out a comic called the Fall of Little Red Riding Hood which gave life to that old tale. The Wolves were a tribe and they discovered that humans were quite breedable and made wonderful fleshy lovers. In that vain, I plan to explore the source content more fully writing out a plot of how the Wolves begin to take human settlements and make humanity their literal bitches. Its a wonderful anthro on human story line, it has lots of corruption and even transformation play involved. If you want to get fucked by literal big bad wolfs, this is a good plot for you. &amp;#x200B; **Supernatural Girlfriend AKA My Little Succubus** \- A general story I been working on is slice of life story with Succubus Girlfriend. As I continued to write this setting I started to think about other potential Super Natural Lovers. A Vampire Girlfriend who requires to feed on me from time to time and loves to watch movies all night, a Ghost Girlfriend who is around the time but is never really there, an Orc Girlfriend who is as strong as me and really loves sports but has a temper. Its clever collection of couples in a modern setting exploring how we 'click' as lovers. If you want to play multiple girlfriends I wont say no to such a story, I also have supernatural boyfriends encase you want to be human female with her hung werewolf boyfriend or whatever. &amp;#x200B; **Wincestor House** \- Wincestor House is a basically a haunted mansion or manor that has sexualized ghosts who to fuck the family that moves in. This is easily my most incestuous plot on the list and has things like possession, phantom lovers, flashbacks to other lives, and living objects involved in the plot. I try not to make it a horror movie but nor do I want it to be boring or tame. Its somewhere between House on Haunted Hill, Crimson Peak, Poltergeist and pinch of Casper with a big scoop of porn. I have a primary plot focused on the occult and witchcraft connected to family sex but that plot isnt for everyone so ask me what other options I have if that's not your thing. &amp;#x200B; **Other Originals** \- I have dozens of other plots unposted. Alpha Formula - Chemical turns man into a half man/half wolf beast. Family Farm - A family is turned into beasts of burden on their own farm. Invasion of the Space Futa - Alien Amazons with Cocks invade earth. Master PC - Reality altering PC program changes peoples reality with a few times. And the list goes on. If you have ideas of your own feel free to share, I might have a plot for that. # Canon Stories **The 13 Kingdoms**: *A Disney Story* \- The various Disney Girls reimagined in a interconnected world that plays a lot like with Lord of the Rings with a fair amount of strong female characters. I typically play ""The Big Bad Wolf"" in these stories as a former hero who was twisted by dark powers and now resides in a gray area where he is neither trusted by the Princesses or the Wicked Witches. We can discuss where you might like to take this plot. &amp;#x200B; **Apex**: *A Overwatch Story* \- A new villain called APEX emerges as a nanite infused human who seeks to get revenge on the members of Overwatch and steal their tech. There is no doubt he will enslave them making them into wanton sluts once he has their way with them. Certain characters hold high value like Tracers whos chest plate will allow APEX to distort time. The more he claims the more dangerous he becomes. Will Overwatch and Talon join forces to stop this new foe who seeks to rule the world? &amp;#x200B; **Big Bad Wolf:** *A Witcher Story* \- Geralt is one of the stronger male characters in the past 20 years. I would love to do a simple story with him hunting monsters and having various romantic encounters. If that doesnt scratch your itch he can be corrupted by a perverted mutagen or come down a case of the Werewolfs before breeding Yen, Triss, and Ciri. Please at least know the video games. &amp;#x200B; **Darkest Night**: *A Batman Story* \- Batman isn't terribly interesting but he is fit, smart, rich and in my stories hung. I like a good plot where he is corrupted by Ivy into her equal or a injection from Harley that makes him lose control. The how/why are flexible but what happens after is always the same. He starts to fuck the hell out of the women of Gotham and he takes the best ones back to Wayne Manor to be his harem of super women. &amp;#x200B; **Distant Corners:** *A Star Trek Story* \- I been super eager to meet a female Trekkie who wants to build and OC crew and explore the universe. This is nothing short of an undertaking and we need to be sure we click as players before investing the time and energy into populating a crew. If done right we will have a strong female crew getting into sexy adventures in no time! &amp;#x200B; **Emerging Reality**: *A Marvel/DC Story* \- I been exploring the merging of universes them with Marvel/DC coming together. I even added Overwatch, Lara Croft, Ben 10 and other settings to the same universe. The means changes from the Infinity Stones merging worlds or some other macguffin causing the realities to merge. My favorite character to play is Green Lantern and I have merged him once with Peter Parker making a new character. Super Flexible here with who the lead male can be and where we take the plot. &amp;#x200B; **Fang:** *A Miraculous Story* \- I watched this show with my niece and thought it be fun to write a story where a more dominant older character stepped in and fought crime with Lady Bug. I already settled with this character being a Wolf, about 30 something years old and dominating the fuck out of the school girls in this setting. Expect a very different kind of Miraculous story if you undertake this with me. &amp;#x200B; **The Gray Jedi:** *The Star Wars Story* \- I don't always play Star Wars stories but when I do I am Gray Jedi Master who fucks his padawans. Really though most Star Wars plots are great but I prefer the Old Republic over any other setting. Multiple padwans are desired in this setting. OC characters are great. Canon women are more then welcome. &amp;#x200B; **The King of the North:** *A* *Game of Thrones* \- I do A LOT of retcons on Game of Thrones and 95% of them are saving a hot female from a untimely death. Moving beyond that I usually explore a plot where Jon Snow becomes a dominant stud and starts to build an empire in the North and in the wombs of any woman he see's fit. The means of corruption usually comes from Ygritte shooting some arrows into him only this time the arrows are poisoned and he gets changed by the experience. Does he get bigger and stronger? Just a massive cock? Maybe he turns into Wolf or Dragon? Who knows! Well I do but I mean what do you want from this story. &amp;#x200B; **Lord of Columbia**: *A Bioshock Story* \- Elizabeth from Bioshock might be one of my top 10 females from video games; Lara Croft, Sarah Kerrigan, and Tali'Zorah also make that list. What makes me want to put her on this list? Reality hopping. I love the idea of her teaming up with her Daddy (Booker) and helping him find other versions of her and making them his. Its perverted, incestous and has themes of ageplay, harems, and breeding but I fucking love it. Even more so if he takes Rapture as well. This is pretty much for pervs who love Bioshock as much as me. &amp;#x200B; **Normandy Harem:** *Mass Effect Story* \- There are three avenues to make Shepard become 'evil'. Cerberus Nanites, Collector Parasites, or Reaper Indoctrination Device. I tend to prefer the first option but the result always leads him to fucking the women of the Normandy. Is this plot not your thing? I have ideas for Andromeda and a clone program that makes a bunch of female Shepards. &amp;#x200B; **Symbiote Chronicles**: *A Spider-man Story* \- I find Peter Parker, bit of a Gary Stu. I actually really enjoyed how human they made him in Enter the Spider-Verse. I am getting off track. Point is, I play a more human Spider-man. He's not smarter then Stark, he cant lift two tanks, and he cant shoot a web faster then hammer of a pistol after the trigger is pulled. I am off track again. Spider-Man. Sexual Deviant. Venom Symbiote. Lots of Sex. Mary Jane. Gwen Stacey. Snoo Snoo. You get the idea. &amp;#x200B; **Tongue of the Dragon:** *A Skyrim Story* \- A shelved story idea I been to fucking lazy to finish. Sexy Dragon Shouts. Is it possible? Actually yeah the vocab is there but I haven't spent the time to put together a list of perverted shouts. Shouts that would rip armor off a female warriors body, make a person instantly more submissive or make them susceptible to mind control. It should be noted &amp;#x200B; **Vault Alpha:** *A Fallout Story* \- I have about 10 Vaults I made for the Fallout setting. Hands down my favorite is Vault Alpha also known as a cultural preservation vault. A girls school with a bunch of students from all over the world (including communist China) and their cultures knowledge saved with them. Of course, there was a boys school with same objective but they didn't survive (or did they?) but with the tunnel joining the vaults collapsed they wont find out anytime soon. Its a fun take on Fallout and one I love to explore. If thats not your thing guess what? I got more fucking fallout plots! &amp;#x200B; **Other Canon** \- Honestly the list of games, books, movies, shows, cartoon, anime, and comics goes on forever. Make a list of your favorites from those listed media mediums and present them in conversation. I will let you know which ones I know and are willing to play. I freely admit my anime/manga selection is limited to mostly what comes across Adult Swim. # Generic Stories **Angels &amp; Demons** \- Summoning an Incubus, Hell on Earth with angels and demons fighting for souls, a taboo coupling of angel and demon, and more. I love a good Heaven and Hell story. &amp;#x200B; **Cyber/Bio/Nanopunk** \- I tend to lean towards criminals, hackers, ex-military types, and noir style detectives. I always loved these setting where humanity has blurred the lines between man and machine and began to twist his DNA to suit his needs. &amp;#x200B; **CYOA** \- There are now lewd CYOA's that exist online. If you have something that gets you nice and wet feel free to share. I have a F-list profile dedicated to my collection. &amp;#x200B; **End of the World/Post Apoc** \- Gritty stories where the world has ended by drought, plague, radiation, virus or even the undead. While I would never wish this on humanity it does bring peoples character to the surface. Are you a Criminal? A Survivor? A reluctant hero? A submissive? The end of the world will let you know. &amp;#x200B; **Fantasy** \- Orcs, Centaurs, Elves, and Demons! Oh my! I personally love Conquest plots where kingdoms fall to invaders who take the spoils. Other stories like a demonic curse or princess in hiding also interest me. &amp;#x200B; **Fairy Tales** \- I love a good folk tale! We can keep it in the fantasy setting or shift it to a modern setting. Alternatively I been exploring polytheistic gods in the same lense as Fairy Tales, so if you want to see stories about Zeus. Let me know. &amp;#x200B; **Furries** \- Oh god he rights furry stories as well? Yeah I fucking do. I am a Big Bad Wolf who ruts foxes and bunnies wanna fight about it? &amp;#x200B; **Free Use World** \- A popular choice on Reddit where people are used freely in society for sexual purposes. I can get behind this sort of plot with the right people and in the right setting. Come with a good reason for society become so sexually open. &amp;#x200B; **Holiday** \- Christmas, Halloween, Easter, Etc. I have a profile dedicated to Holiday stories on F-list. I am willing to indulge in the festivities here. If you wanna get fucked in a Halloween costume? I got you. Want to be wrapped in a big bow for Christmas? Of course. Wanna get dominated by an anthro easter bunny? I'm your man. &amp;#x200B; **Incest** \- I have a lewd soft spot for Brother/Sister and Father/Daughter plots myself. Not against Uncle/Niece or Son/Mother either. If a story has family members as characters, I am more than willing to explore those perverted couplings. &amp;#x200B; **Interracial** \- This is a tough one only because racism is still a real thing and I walk this fine line between playing interracial motivated scenes and some stereotypes. There are real bigots online who solely get off on racist scenes and cant separate a short fantasy from respecting and caring for other people in the real world. If you find yourself believe racist beliefs and taking that as you personal social/political view. I am not the man for you. &amp;#x200B; **Military/Spies** \- Gritty settings mostly set in the middle east these days. I enjoy the occasional boots on the ground story where soldiers let off steam while in a secluded base. I admit I added zombies to these military plots a few times. Spies are little more different, located in the cities and focuses on the spy craft itself. &amp;#x200B; **Modern Fantasy** \- Magical wielders hidden in plain sight in the modern world. This includes Elves hiding their ears, vampires in a modern setting, men locking themselves in shipping containers under a full moon, or immortal gods running their own companies. The possibilities are endless. &amp;#x200B; **Monsters** \- I can play a werewolf, incubus, tentacle fiend, or whatever for your personal cravings. Monsters can be fun if done right and unlike most settings it can be done fantasy, modern or scifi no problem. &amp;#x200B; **Slasher** \- Been kicking around the idea of a sexy slasher setting. Big scary 'killer' hunting teens only instead of murdering them he fucks them senseless. Maybe they are fucked so hard they are knocked out for hours or start to like the slasher with that giant cock. I dont know. &amp;#x200B; **Space Opera** \- Space marines, derelict ship with aliens on-board, colonization missions, or just a ragtag crew taking on odd jobs. I love me a good space story! &amp;#x200B; **Steam/Diesel/Atom/Clockpunk** \- A fun setting that I mostly write with furry characters. The main reason why we love these settings? Personal sky ships, fashion and a sense of adventure. Great backdrop for a lewd story. &amp;#x200B; **Super Heroes** \- We can either use canon heroes or make up our own heroes for some super powered sex scenes. I usually play a Batman Esq hero myself but if you want me to fly and fuck you so hard we take down a building I am down. &amp;#x200B; **Supernatural** \- Be it the occult, witchcraft, demons, ancient books or artifacts or whatever. I have a Templar who's managed to survive hundreds of years as a potential champion for the story of our choosing. If you love the Supernatural we can expand on it together. &amp;#x200B; **Toons** \- We all love cartoons and I am more than willing to explore the hundereds of lovely characters given to us in Cartoons. We can write a story with the Power Puff Girls or we can have a plot where we live in a cartoon reality (Like Cool World) where physics are suggestions and the only way to kill a toon is with a eraser. &amp;#x200B; **Westerns** \- I found Westerns are pretty hard plots to get off the ground. When I have written plots like this its mostly bounty hunting or building a homestead with a strong female and her son. I only have a few working ideas for this setting so meet me half way on the brainstorming. &amp;#x200B; **Witches &amp; Warlocks** \- After watching that new Sabrina, witchcraft has been on my mind. If you want to explore a setting that explores Witchcraft be in our modern world or Hogwarts I am down. &amp;#x200B; **Other Settings** \- I probably missed some things like Tron, Gor, Robots, and historical periods. If you have something you like feel free to suggest it. Worse case scenario is me saying ""No Thanks"" and suggesting something else. Be creative and feel free to mix and match ideas like Cyberpunk and Zombies, sounds fucking awesome to me. # Top Kinks * **Ageplay** \- Loli's and Jailbait to Milfs and Dilfs. I like ageplay in my stories (depending on the plot) and so should you. It's not mandatory but if want to up your chances to play with me you need to be ok with this kink. * **Breeding/Pregnancy** \- Not sure when I developed this kink but I love the idea of knocking up my companions. Its the connection that it creates putting a baby in a fertile womb. I am down to explore this kink all the way up to birth, such scenes involving that should happen off screen. * **Corruption** \- Just like Transformation but changing of the mind. I like moving the dial of characters morality and personality in a story. My favorite is a Lawful Good male becoming a Deviant Dominating Pervert. He doesnt need to be evil, he just needs to value sex over people. * **Domination** \- I like to be in control in most stories. Master/Slave, Daddy/Daughter, Alpha/Omega and so on. I dont mind stories that involve scenes where I am submissive but there is no chance I will do a plot where I remain that way. Where I dont turn the tables and take control of the woman who thought she was the mistress. * **Harem Play** \- Needless to say I am kind of greedy. I like plots where I claim multiple girls. If you think thats unfair, let me remind you I GM/DM 99% of my stories so the work load is more often then not on my shoulders. If you're willing to play a harem for me, you get to move to the front of the line. * **Incest** \- A family that plays together. Stays together. Incest is not a must but I love to have it appear in most plots. Improve your chances of playing by agreeing to exploring this kink. * **Interracial** \- I love a good mix of skin colors in the bedroom. I love the cultural differences and exploring how people fit. However, if you I think you are a real racist; MAGA hat wearing Neo-Nazi Trump voter. You can go fuck yourself. * **Mind Control** \- Closely related to corruption. I love playing with mind control. It can be easy like swinging a gem in front of your face until your under a trance or it can be hard like me slowly reprogramming your mind by altering memories. I enjoy both fantastical snap your fingers mind control and the realistic subliminal music/image approach that takes effect over time. * **Transformation** \- There is something about getting bigger, thicker, stronger, or turning from man to beast that turns me on. I like it when it happens to me. I like it when it happens to you. Most my stories have TF to varying degrees. # Closing So there you have it my long winded post to catch quality female players like you. Reddit isn't a great space to hunt for female players if only because there are 10 to 1 male to female ratio and lesser males love to downvote other \[M4F\] posts above/below their own. If you have read this full post; Good Job, Gold Star! Shoot me a Message (Reddit chat is hot garbage), if we click well we will move this party to Discord where hopefully we will play for a very very long time. &amp;#x200B; Lewd Regards, **Master of Perversion** ^(P.S.

Suggest a list of your favorites.\*\** # About Me Hey there my name is **Master of Perversions** or **Perversions** for short. I am a long time roleplayer who has been writing erotic stories for nearly 20+ years now, so needless to say I am experienced and have lots of lewd ideas. If you want some more personal info on me. I am a 33 California native, I am over six feet tall, I have muscular/athletic body type, and despite being sweet progressive guy IRL loves to be dominant with female companions. I am mostly open book willing to share some personal details about myself with you (well most details). # Requirements So now you know about me and you want to grab my attention? There are some elements I think make female players stand out above their peers and keep me interested. If you check off all or most of the items on this list then I promise you that I will respond to your PM in kind. * **Creative/Geeky/Perverted Female** \- The three corner stones of a perfect female player. She should be creative enough to run with ideas, geeky enough to lots of canon she can draw inspiration from and perverted enough to get behind my lewd kinks. * **Playing on Discord** \- I pretty much play exclusively on Discord now. With the private servers, easy image sharing, and being able to edit a post after its sent. Its easily THE BEST way to roleplay. Reddit is good for initial PM only. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female player. If you're a male playing a female that won't cut it for me. If your trans, you can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling a connection or not. Gender, Orientation, and Sexuality is complex. I wont ask you to demand you conform to my sexuality and you shouldn't try and force me to conform to yours. * **Switch or Submissive** \- I don't mind rolling in bed with a woman who likes to take control but more often then not I like to be the alpha in the bedroom. I am not saying NO to dominant woman, just understand my goal is to eventually 'break' you. * **Flexible Age Range** \- Stories often have a variety of characters. Expect to play underage characters in these stories. If you have issues with ageplay we can make them NPC style characters who are present but don't get involved in sex. The more flexible you are the better your chances. * **Multiple Characters** \- The stories I write are complex. I often take on a DM/GM role writing the world with multiple characters (I wont say no to a female DM/GMing for me). If you are a player who can only write one character, I mean no offense but my stories require multiple characters. * **Open Book Players** \- I want to get to know you. I will ask you A/S/L, your first name and some other personal questions about who you are. That said, I **WILL NEVER** ask for your phone number, personal email, where you work, or your last name. There are details that can be shared that preserve your anonymity and others that compromise it. I aim to protect you and myself while getting to know you some. * **Quantity and Quality** \- Writing a quality post can be hard. There are various elements that can undermine a post. Repeating what I said in your post and not adding anything new to the scene, god modding characters (AKA Mary Suing), one liner responses, and the list goes on. I am willing to invest time and effort into playing with you, I don't think its unfair for you to do the same with me. * **Hard No Kinks** \- I will NOT humor ANY of these kinks, I wont shame you but having these any where in your prompt history will discourage me from playing with you: Diapers/Infantilism, Snuff, Mutilation/Nullification, Gore, Obese/Fat/Hyper Fat, Vomiting, Gas/Farting, Blood, Scat, STD's, Popping, Prolapsing, and Toilet Play. If a kink relates to this list then I probably don't want to involve it. # Current Story Cravings **NA** \- This will be filled in soon. # Original Stories **Body Shifters** \- The Body Shifters are a 'female' alien species that live for/crave/eat cum in order to stay healthy. They can alter their bodies at will changing size, shape, color, and clothes at a thought. They are loyal to their human lovers who they feed off of by fucking/sucking all day long. Our story will follow one of this lucky males who gets hooked up with one of these alien babes and trying to keep her a secret while his life becomes one of sex and keeping his alien girls happy. Oh did I mention the more you feed them that they eventually get so big that they split into two new girls? Yeah... that happens. **Castaways** \- A simple plot of either crash landing or being shipwrecked on a deserted island (or planet if Scifi setting). I always liked the concept of being alone and working hard to survive. Of course as a erotic roleplay a guy on a island by himself jerking off is pretty boring, so we are gonna have some girls wash up on that island with him! What will they find on the island? Who knows. Could be amazon tribe, a lost fertility goddess, the fountain of youth, human sized venus fly taps with tentacles, or mind/body altering plants that make us into animals. The possibilities are endless but the premises is always the same. **Dawn of the Breasts** \- Its basically a zombie story only instead of rotting corpses ravaging people, the infected are naked horny and feral bimbos/himbos. No killing needed for this plot all it takes is some cum, breast milk or saliva to start someones inevitable fall to this very sexy disease. Transformation plays a big role here were people take a load and start to put on hyper fertile curves before chasing down their friends and family to turn them as well. There are lots of places to start a story like which makes it highly erotic and versatile. **Dirty Politics** \- A recent idea I been playing with is exploring someones rise to power in the modern political age. He can either be a brilliant politician or have mind control abilities allowing him to get what he needs/wants done quickly. Politically speaking his ideas are often for the best of society and does right by the people but behind closed doors he will make his opponents daughters his own personal sluts to spy on their fathers and help him build a empire of influence under his enemies noses. We may even use famous politicians to do it. **Fertile Valley** \- If you read erotica on the web then you likely came across Fertile Valley. While not every aspect of the original story turned me on the concept of a small secluded town affected by their tainted water supply was something that stuck with me. I am looking for a imagining of this plot with a federal agent moving to the town to find out what the fuck is going on only to have the effects start to alter him and his family. The question is will he stop it before he is too far gone or will he give into the pleasure and embrace the communities incestuous culture? Only one way to find out. **La Resistance** \- A story for all you history lovers out there who love period pieces. La Resistance follows the French Resistance in Paris during WW2. The general plot of the story follows a OSS Operative from the US sent into France to help establish the resistance and help them defeat the Nazis. The team he build will be mostly (if not all) female operatives from various walks of life. I have some characters already created and while French girl is the largest group we also have German, English, Irish, Russian, and American girls among the list of playable characters. If this interests you let me know and I can share what I have written so far. **Man With All The Gifts** \- A relatively generic plot considering all the other stories on the list. I bachelor, father, divorced dad, and/or teacher is given a new lot in life be in magic, miracle pill, alien ray gun, or body altering nanites or whatever. Whatever starts the changes it will allow him to become more over time and eventually make him a demi-god among men. Naturally as any demi-god would do, he starts to claim the women of his life! Coworkers, old girlfriends, ex-wife, daughters, daughters friends, neighbors and so on. It's really a male power fantasy but I find a fair amount of female players wanting to be claimed by a true alpha. An there arnt any bigger alphas than him! **I Love Puazi** \- The Puazi are an alien species who moved to earth to cohabitate with humanity. Thats the general setting in a nutshell. The fun part about the Puazi is their biology makes them really into the smells of earth mammals, primarily humans. The musk makes them sway on their feet, go cross eyed and crave that drug that is a human climax in their mouth. If you don't know the Puazi, I would suggest googling Puazi Incase and getting to know the source material! I promise its worth the read of those lewd comics. **Only We Remain** \- If you get to know me, you will find that I have a deep affection for zombie plots. The scavenging, rebuilding, survival, and fighting create a very compelling plot. Only We Remain (Parodyish title of the Last of Us) follows a alien spore that starts converting men into undead monsters. Its harder to elaborate on then other stories as I have infected types, locations, survivor groups, and the science of infection pretty clearly laid out. If you want a true zombie survival plot that is 2/3rds plots and 1/3rd sex? This is the best plot for you. **Rise of the Wolves** \- Jay Naylor put out a comic called the Fall of Little Red Riding Hood which gave life to that old tale. The Wolves were a tribe and they discovered that humans were quite breedable and made wonderful fleshy lovers. In that vain, I plan to explore the source content more fully writing out a plot of how the Wolves begin to take human settlements and make humanity their literal bitches. Its a wonderful anthro on human story line, it has lots of corruption and even transformation play involved. If you want to get fucked by literal big bad wolfs, this is a good plot for you. **Supernatural Girlfriend AKA My Little Succubus** \- A general story I been working on is slice of life story with Succubus Girlfriend. As I continued to write this setting I started to think about other potential Super Natural Lovers. A Vampire Girlfriend who requires to feed on me from time to time and loves to watch movies all night, a Ghost Girlfriend who is around the time but is never really there, an Orc Girlfriend who is as strong as me and really loves sports but has a temper. Its clever collection of couples in a modern setting exploring how we 'click' as lovers. If you want to play multiple girlfriends I wont say no to such a story, I also have supernatural boyfriends encase you want to be human female with her hung werewolf boyfriend or whatever. **Wincestor House** \- Wincestor House is a basically a haunted mansion or manor that has sexualized ghosts who to fuck the family that moves in. This is easily my most incestuous plot on the list and has things like possession, phantom lovers, flashbacks to other lives, and living objects involved in the plot. I try not to make it a horror movie but nor do I want it to be boring or tame. Its somewhere between House on Haunted Hill, Crimson Peak, Poltergeist and pinch of Casper with a big scoop of porn. I have a primary plot focused on the occult and witchcraft connected to family sex but that plot isnt for everyone so ask me what other options I have if that's not your thing. **Other Originals** \- I have dozens of other plots unposted. Alpha Formula - Chemical turns man into a half man/half wolf beast. Family Farm - A family is turned into beasts of burden on their own farm. Invasion of the Space Futa - Alien Amazons with Cocks invade earth. Master PC - Reality altering PC program changes peoples reality with a few times. And the list goes on. If you have ideas of your own feel free to share, I might have a plot for that. # Canon Stories **The 13 Kingdoms**: *A Disney Story* \- The various Disney Girls reimagined in a interconnected world that plays a lot like with Lord of the Rings with a fair amount of strong female characters. I typically play ""The Big Bad Wolf"" in these stories as a former hero who was twisted by dark powers and now resides in a gray area where he is neither trusted by the Princesses or the Wicked Witches. We can discuss where you might like to take this plot. **Apex**: *A Overwatch Story* \- A new villain called APEX emerges as a nanite infused human who seeks to get revenge on the members of Overwatch and steal their tech. There is no doubt he will enslave them making them into wanton sluts once he has their way with them. Certain characters hold high value like Tracers whos chest plate will allow APEX to distort time. The more he claims the more dangerous he becomes. Will Overwatch and Talon join forces to stop this new foe who seeks to rule the world? **Big Bad Wolf:** *A Witcher Story* \- Geralt is one of the stronger male characters in the past 20 years. I would love to do a simple story with him hunting monsters and having various romantic encounters. If that doesnt scratch your itch he can be corrupted by a perverted mutagen or come down a case of the Werewolfs before breeding Yen, Triss, and Ciri. Please at least know the video games. **Darkest Night**: *A Batman Story* \- Batman isn't terribly interesting but he is fit, smart, rich and in my stories hung. I like a good plot where he is corrupted by Ivy into her equal or a injection from Harley that makes him lose control. The how/why are flexible but what happens after is always the same. He starts to fuck the hell out of the women of Gotham and he takes the best ones back to Wayne Manor to be his harem of super women. **Distant Corners:** *A Star Trek Story* \- I been super eager to meet a female Trekkie who wants to build and OC crew and explore the universe. This is nothing short of an undertaking and we need to be sure we click as players before investing the time and energy into populating a crew. If done right we will have a strong female crew getting into sexy adventures in no time! **Emerging Reality**: *A Marvel/DC Story* \- I been exploring the merging of universes them with Marvel/DC coming together. I even added Overwatch, Lara Croft, Ben 10 and other settings to the same universe. The means changes from the Infinity Stones merging worlds or some other macguffin causing the realities to merge. My favorite character to play is Green Lantern and I have merged him once with Peter Parker making a new character. Super Flexible here with who the lead male can be and where we take the plot. **Fang:** *A Miraculous Story* \- I watched this show with my niece and thought it be fun to write a story where a more dominant older character stepped in and fought crime with Lady Bug. I already settled with this character being a Wolf, about 30 something years old and dominating the fuck out of the school girls in this setting. Expect a very different kind of Miraculous story if you undertake this with me. **The Gray Jedi:** *The Star Wars Story* \- I don't always play Star Wars stories but when I do I am Gray Jedi Master who fucks his padawans. Really though most Star Wars plots are great but I prefer the Old Republic over any other setting. Multiple padwans are desired in this setting. OC characters are great. Canon women are more then welcome. **The King of the North:** *A* *Game of Thrones* \- I do A LOT of retcons on Game of Thrones and 95% of them are saving a hot female from a untimely death. Moving beyond that I usually explore a plot where Jon Snow becomes a dominant stud and starts to build an empire in the North and in the wombs of any woman he see's fit. The means of corruption usually comes from Ygritte shooting some arrows into him only this time the arrows are poisoned and he gets changed by the experience. Does he get bigger and stronger? Just a massive cock? Maybe he turns into Wolf or Dragon? Who knows! Well I do but I mean what do you want from this story. **Lord of Columbia**: *A Bioshock Story* \- Elizabeth from Bioshock might be one of my top 10 females from video games; Lara Croft, Sarah Kerrigan, and Tali'Zorah also make that list. What makes me want to put her on this list? Reality hopping. I love the idea of her teaming up with her Daddy (Booker) and helping him find other versions of her and making them his. Its perverted, incestous and has themes of ageplay, harems, and breeding but I fucking love it. Even more so if he takes Rapture as well. This is pretty much for pervs who love Bioshock as much as me. **Normandy Harem:** *Mass Effect Story* \- There are three avenues to make Shepard become 'evil'. Cerberus Nanites, Collector Parasites, or Reaper Indoctrination Device. I tend to prefer the first option but the result always leads him to fucking the women of the Normandy. Is this plot not your thing? I have ideas for Andromeda and a clone program that makes a bunch of female Shepards. **Symbiote Chronicles**: *A Spider-man Story* \- I find Peter Parker, bit of a Gary Stu. I actually really enjoyed how human they made him in Enter the Spider-Verse. I am getting off track. Point is, I play a more human Spider-man. He's not smarter then Stark, he cant lift two tanks, and he cant shoot a web faster then hammer of a pistol after the trigger is pulled. I am off track again. Spider-Man. Sexual Deviant. Venom Symbiote. Lots of Sex. Mary Jane. Gwen Stacey. Snoo Snoo. You get the idea. **Tongue of the Dragon:** *A Skyrim Story* \- A shelved story idea I been to fucking lazy to finish. Sexy Dragon Shouts. Is it possible? Actually yeah the vocab is there but I haven't spent the time to put together a list of perverted shouts. Shouts that would rip armor off a female warriors body, make a person instantly more submissive or make them susceptible to mind control. It should be noted **Vault Alpha:** *A Fallout Story* \- I have about 10 Vaults I made for the Fallout setting. Hands down my favorite is Vault Alpha also known as a cultural preservation vault. A girls school with a bunch of students from all over the world (including communist China) and their cultures knowledge saved with them. Of course, there was a boys school with same objective but they didn't survive (or did they?) but with the tunnel joining the vaults collapsed they wont find out anytime soon. Its a fun take on Fallout and one I love to explore. If thats not your thing guess what? I got more fucking fallout plots! **Other Canon** \- Honestly the list of games, books, movies, shows, cartoon, anime, and comics goes on forever. Make a list of your favorites from those listed media mediums and present them in conversation. I will let you know which ones I know and are willing to play. I freely admit my anime/manga selection is limited to mostly what comes across Adult Swim. # Generic Stories **Angels &amp; Demons** \- Summoning an Incubus, Hell on Earth with angels and demons fighting for souls, a taboo coupling of angel and demon, and more. I love a good Heaven and Hell story. **Cyber/Bio/Nanopunk** \- I tend to lean towards criminals, hackers, ex-military types, and noir style detectives. I always loved these setting where humanity has blurred the lines between man and machine and began to twist his DNA to suit his needs. **CYOA** \- There are now lewd CYOA's that exist online. If you have something that gets you nice and wet feel free to share. I have a F-list profile dedicated to my collection. **End of the World/Post Apoc** \- Gritty stories where the world has ended by drought, plague, radiation, virus or even the undead. While I would never wish this on humanity it does bring peoples character to the surface. Are you a Criminal? A Survivor? A reluctant hero? A submissive? The end of the world will let you know. **Fantasy** \- Orcs, Centaurs, Elves, and Demons! Oh my! I personally love Conquest plots where kingdoms fall to invaders who take the spoils. Other stories like a demonic curse or princess in hiding also interest me. **Fairy Tales** \- I love a good folk tale! We can keep it in the fantasy setting or shift it to a modern setting. Alternatively I been exploring polytheistic gods in the same lense as Fairy Tales, so if you want to see stories about Zeus. Let me know. **Furries** \- Oh god he rights furry stories as well? Yeah I fucking do. I am a Big Bad Wolf who ruts foxes and bunnies wanna fight about it? **Free Use World** \- NA **Holiday** \- NA **Incest** \- NA **Interracial** \- NA **Military/Spies** \- NA **Modern Fantasy** \- NA **Monsters** \- NA **Scifi** \- NA **Slasher** \- NA **Space Opera** \- NA **Steam/Diesel/Atom/Clockpunk** \- NA **Super Heroes** \- NA **Supernatural** \- NA **Toons** \- NA **Westerns** \- I found Westerns are pretty hard plots to get off the ground. When I have written plots like this its mostly bounty hunting or building a homestead with a strong female and her son. I only have a few working ideas for this setting so meet me half way on the brainstorming. **Witches &amp; Warlocks** \- After watching that new Sabrina, witchcraft has been on my mind. If you want to explore a setting that explores Witchcraft be in our modern world or Hogwarts I am down. **Other Settings** \- I probably missed some things like Tron, Gor, Robots, and historical periods. If you have something you like feel free to suggest it. Worse case scenario is me saying ""No Thanks"" and suggesting something else. Be creative and feel free to mix and match ideas like Cyberpunk and Zombies, sounds fucking awesome to me. # Top Kinks * **Ageplay** \- Loli's and Jailbait to Milfs and Dilfs. I like ageplay in my stories (depending on the plot) and so should you. It's not mandatory but if want to up your chances to play with me you need to be ok with this kink. * **Breeding/Pregnancy** \- Not sure when I developed this kink but I love the idea of knocking up my companions. Its the connection that it creates putting a baby in a fertile womb. I am down to explore this kink all the way up to birth, such scenes involving that should happen off screen. * **Corruption** \- Just like Transformation but changing of the mind. I like moving the dial of characters morality and personality in a story. My favorite is a Lawful Good male becoming a Deviant Dominating Pervert. He doesnt need to be evil, he just needs to value sex over people. * **Domination** \- I like to be in control in most stories. Master/Slave, Daddy/Daughter, Alpha/Omega and so on. I dont mind stories that involve scenes where I am submissive but there is no chance I will do a plot where I remain that way. Where I dont turn the tables and take control of the woman who thought she was the mistress. * **Harem Play** \- Needless to say I am kind of greedy. I like plots where I claim multiple girls. If you think thats unfair, let me remind you I GM/DM 99% of my stories so the work load is more often then not on my shoulders. If you're willing to play a harem for me, you get to move to the front of the line. * **Incest** \- A family that plays together. Stays together. Incest is not a must but I love to have it appear in most plots. Improve your chances of playing by agreeing to exploring this kink. * **Interracial** \- I love a good mix of skin colors in the bedroom. I love the cultural differences and exploring how people fit. However, if you I think you are a real racist; MAGA hat wearing Neo Nazi Trump voter. You can properly go fuck yourself. * **Mind Control** \- Closely related to corruption. I love playing with mind control. It can be easy like swinging a gem in front of your face until your under a trance or it can be hard like me slowly reprogramming your mind by altering memories. I enjoy both fantastical snap your fingers mind control and the realistic subliminal music/image approach that takes effect over time. * **Transformation** \- There is something about getting bigger, thicker, stronger, or turning from man to beast that turns me on. I like it when it happens to me. I like it when it happens to you. Most my stories have TF to varying degrees. # Closing So there you have it my long winded post to catch quality female players like you. Reddit isn't a great space to hunt for female players if only because there are 10 to 1 male to female ratio and lesser males love to downvote other \[M4F\] posts above/below their own. If you have read this full post; Good Job, Gold Star! Shoot me a Message (Reddit chat is hot garbage), if we click well we will move this party to Discord where hopefully we will play for a very very long time. &amp;#x200B; Lewd Regards, **Master of Perversion** ^(P.S.

Suggest a list of your favorites.\*\** # About Me Hey there my name is **Master of Perversions** or **Perversions** for short. I am a long time roleplayer who has been writing erotic stories for nearly 20+ years now, so needless to say I am experienced and have lots of lewd ideas. If you want some more personal info on me. I am a 33 California native, I am over six feet tall, I am in good shape (go to the gym, run, soocer, rock-climb), and I am progressive meaning I respect women but I also am very dominant in the bedroom. I am pretty open book willing to share about myself and I hope to meet partners who feel the same. # Requirements So now you know about me and you want to grab my attention? There are some elements I think make female players stand out above their peers and keep me interested. If you check off all (or most) of the items on this list than you will have me very interested. * **Creative/Geeky/Perverted Female** \- The three corner stones of a perfect female player. She should be creative enough to run with ideas, geeky enough to lots of canon she can draw inspiration from and perverted enough to get behind my lewd kinks. * **Playing on Discord** \- I pretty much play exclusively on Discord now. With the private servers, easy image sharing, and being able to edit a post after its sent. Its easily THE BEST application for roleplay. Reddit is good for initial PM only. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female? That won't cut it for me. If your trans? You can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling a connection or not. Gender, Orientation, and Sexuality is complex. I wont ask you to conform to my sexuality and you shouldn't force me to conform to yours. * **Switch or Submissive** \- I don't mind rolling in bed with a woman who likes to take control but I like to be the dom in the bedroom. I am not saying NO to dominant woman, just understand my goal is to make you mine. * **Flexible Age Range** \- Stories often have a variety of characters differing in age, expect to have underage characters in these stories. If you have issues with ageplay we can make them NPC style characters who are present but don't get involved in sex. The more flexible your age range are the better your chances. * **Multiple Characters** \- The stories I write are... complex. I often take on a DM/GM role writing the world with multiple characters (I wont say no to a female DM/GMing for me). If you are a player who can ONLY write one character, I mean no offense but your skill level isn't high enough to play in these sort of plots.. * **Open Book Players** \- I want to get to know you. I will ask you A/S/L, your first name and some other personal questions about who you are. That said, **I** **WILL NEVER** ask for your phone number, personal email, where you work, or your last name. There are details that can be shared that preserve your anonymity online and others that compromise it. I aim to protect you (and myself) asking things that wont give away who you truly are. Unless we reach that level of trust and respect and decide to get closer. * **Quantity and Quality** \- Writing a quality post can be difficult. There are various elements that can undermine a post. Repeating what I said in your post, not adding anything new to the scene, god modding characters (AKA Mary Suing), one liner responses, and the list goes on. I am willing to invest time and effort into playing with you, I don't think its unfair to ask you to do the same with me. * **Hard No Kinks** \- I will NOT humor ANY of these kinks, I wont shame you but having these any where in your prompt history will discourage me from playing with you: Diapers/Infantilism, Snuff, Mutilation/Nullification, Gore, Obese/Fat/Hyper Fat, Vomiting, Gas/Farting, Blood, Scat, STD's, Popping, Prolapsing, and Toilet Play. If a kink relates to this list then I probably don't want to involve it. # Original Stories **Body Shifters** \- The Body Shifters are a 'female' alien species that live for/crave/eat cum in order to stay healthy. They can alter their bodies at will changing size, shape, color, and clothes at a thought. They are loyal to their human lovers who they feed off of by fucking/sucking all day long. Our story will follow one of this lucky males who gets hooked up with one of these alien babes and trying to keep her a secret while his life becomes one of sex and keeping his alien girls happy. Oh did I mention the more you feed them that they eventually get so big that they split into two new girls? Yeah... that happens. &amp;#x200B; **Castaways** \- A simple plot of either crash landing or being shipwrecked on a deserted island (or planet if Scifi setting). I always liked the concept of being alone and working hard to survive. Of course as a erotic roleplay a guy on a island by himself jerking off is pretty boring, so we are gonna have some girls wash up on that island with him! What will they find on the island? Who knows. Could be amazon tribe, a lost fertility goddess, the fountain of youth, human sized venus fly taps with tentacles, or mind/body altering plants that make us into animals. The possibilities are endless but the premises is always the same. &amp;#x200B; **Dawn of the Breasts** \- Its basically a zombie story only instead of rotting corpses ravaging people, the infected are naked horny and feral bimbos/himbos. No killing needed for this plot all it takes is some cum, breast milk or saliva to start someones inevitable fall to this very sexy disease. Transformation plays a big role here were people take a load and start to put on hyper fertile curves before chasing down their friends and family to turn them as well. There are lots of places to start a story like which makes it highly erotic and versatile. &amp;#x200B; **Dirty Politics** \- A recent idea I been playing with is exploring someones rise to power in the modern political age. He can either be a brilliant politician or have mind control abilities allowing him to get what he needs/wants done quickly. Politically speaking his ideas are often for the best of society and does right by the people but behind closed doors he will make his opponents daughters his own personal sluts to spy on their fathers and help him build a empire of influence under his enemies noses. We may even use famous politicians to do it. &amp;#x200B; **Fertile Valley** \- If you read erotica on the web then you likely came across Fertile Valley. While not every aspect of the original story turned me on the concept of a small secluded town affected by their tainted water supply was something that stuck with me. I am looking for a imagining of this plot with a federal agent moving to the town to find out what the fuck is going on only to have the effects start to alter him and his family. The question is will he stop it before he is too far gone or will he give into the pleasure and embrace the communities incestuous culture? Only one way to find out. &amp;#x200B; **La Resistance** \- A story for all you history lovers out there who love period pieces. La Resistance follows the French Resistance in Paris during WW2. The general plot of the story follows a OSS Operative from the US sent into France to help establish the resistance and help them defeat the Nazis. The team he build will be mostly (if not all) female operatives from various walks of life. I have some characters already created and while French girl is the largest group we also have German, English, Irish, Russian, and American girls among the list of playable characters. If this interests you let me know and I can share what I have written so far. &amp;#x200B; **Man With All The Gifts** \- A relatively generic plot considering all the other stories on the list. I bachelor, father, divorced dad, and/or teacher is given a new lot in life be in magic, miracle pill, alien ray gun, or body altering nanites or whatever. Whatever starts the changes it will allow him to become more over time and eventually make him a demi-god among men. Naturally as any demi-god would do, he starts to claim the women of his life! Coworkers, old girlfriends, ex-wife, daughters, daughters friends, neighbors and so on. It's really a male power fantasy but I find a fair amount of female players wanting to be claimed by a true alpha. An there arnt any bigger alphas than him! &amp;#x200B; **I Love Puazi** \- The Puazi are an alien species who moved to earth to cohabitate with humanity. Thats the general setting in a nutshell. The fun part about the Puazi is their biology makes them really into the smells of earth mammals, primarily humans. The musk makes them sway on their feet, go cross eyed and crave that drug that is a human climax in their mouth. If you don't know the Puazi, I would suggest googling Puazi Incase and getting to know the source material! I promise its worth the read of those lewd comics. &amp;#x200B; **Only We Remain** \- If you get to know me, you will find that I have a deep affection for zombie plots. The scavenging, rebuilding, survival, and fighting create a very compelling plot. Only We Remain (Parodyish title of the Last of Us) follows a alien spore that starts converting men into undead monsters. Its harder to elaborate on then other stories as I have infected types, locations, survivor groups, and the science of infection pretty clearly laid out. If you want a true zombie survival plot that is 2/3rds plots and 1/3rd sex? This is the best plot for you. &amp;#x200B; **Rise of the Wolves** \- Jay Naylor put out a comic called the Fall of Little Red Riding Hood which gave life to that old tale. The Wolves were a tribe and they discovered that humans were quite breedable and made wonderful fleshy lovers. In that vain, I plan to explore the source content more fully writing out a plot of how the Wolves begin to take human settlements and make humanity their literal bitches. Its a wonderful anthro on human story line, it has lots of corruption and even transformation play involved. If you want to get fucked by literal big bad wolfs, this is a good plot for you. &amp;#x200B; **Supernatural Girlfriend AKA My Little Succubus** \- A general story I been working on is slice of life story with Succubus Girlfriend. As I continued to write this setting I started to think about other potential Super Natural Lovers. A Vampire Girlfriend who requires to feed on me from time to time and loves to watch movies all night, a Ghost Girlfriend who is around the time but is never really there, an Orc Girlfriend who is as strong as me and really loves sports but has a temper. Its clever collection of couples in a modern setting exploring how we 'click' as lovers. If you want to play multiple girlfriends I wont say no to such a story, I also have supernatural boyfriends encase you want to be human female with her hung werewolf boyfriend or whatever. &amp;#x200B; **Wincestor House** \- Wincestor House is a basically a haunted mansion or manor that has sexualized ghosts who to fuck the family that moves in. This is easily my most incestuous plot on the list and has things like possession, phantom lovers, flashbacks to other lives, and living objects involved in the plot. I try not to make it a horror movie but nor do I want it to be boring or tame. Its somewhere between House on Haunted Hill, Crimson Peak, Poltergeist and pinch of Casper with a big scoop of porn. I have a primary plot focused on the occult and witchcraft connected to family sex but that plot isnt for everyone so ask me what other options I have if that's not your thing. &amp;#x200B; **Other Originals** \- I have dozens of other plots unposted. Alpha Formula - Chemical turns man into a half man/half wolf beast. Family Farm - A family is turned into beasts of burden on their own farm. Invasion of the Space Futa - Alien Amazons with Cocks invade earth. Master PC - Reality altering PC program changes peoples reality with a few times. And the list goes on. If you have ideas of your own feel free to share, I might have a plot for that. # Canon Stories **The 13 Kingdoms**: *A Disney Story* \- The various Disney Girls reimagined in a interconnected world that plays a lot like with Lord of the Rings with a fair amount of strong female characters. I typically play ""The Big Bad Wolf"" in these stories as a former hero who was twisted by dark powers and now resides in a gray area where he is neither trusted by the Princesses or the Wicked Witches. We can discuss where you might like to take this plot. &amp;#x200B; **Apex**: *A Overwatch Story* \- A new villain called APEX emerges as a nanite infused human who seeks to get revenge on the members of Overwatch and steal their tech. There is no doubt he will enslave them making them into wanton sluts once he has their way with them. Certain characters hold high value like Tracers whos chest plate will allow APEX to distort time. The more he claims the more dangerous he becomes. Will Overwatch and Talon join forces to stop this new foe who seeks to rule the world? &amp;#x200B; **Big Bad Wolf:** *A Witcher Story* \- Geralt is one of the stronger male characters in the past 20 years. I would love to do a simple story with him hunting monsters and having various romantic encounters. If that doesnt scratch your itch he can be corrupted by a perverted mutagen or come down a case of the Werewolfs before breeding Yen, Triss, and Ciri. Please at least know the video games. &amp;#x200B; **Darkest Night**: *A Batman Story* \- Batman isn't terribly interesting but he is fit, smart, rich and in my stories hung. I like a good plot where he is corrupted by Ivy into her equal or a injection from Harley that makes him lose control. The how/why are flexible but what happens after is always the same. He starts to fuck the hell out of the women of Gotham and he takes the best ones back to Wayne Manor to be his harem of super women. &amp;#x200B; **Distant Corners:** *A Star Trek Story* \- I been super eager to meet a female Trekkie who wants to build and OC crew and explore the universe. This is nothing short of an undertaking and we need to be sure we click as players before investing the time and energy into populating a crew. If done right we will have a strong female crew getting into sexy adventures in no time! &amp;#x200B; **Emerging Reality**: *A Marvel/DC Story* \- I been exploring the merging of universes them with Marvel/DC coming together. I even added Overwatch, Lara Croft, Ben 10 and other settings to the same universe. The means changes from the Infinity Stones merging worlds or some other macguffin causing the realities to merge. My favorite character to play is Green Lantern and I have merged him once with Peter Parker making a new character. Super Flexible here with who the lead male can be and where we take the plot. &amp;#x200B; **Fang:** *A Miraculous Story* \- I watched this show with my niece and thought it be fun to write a story where a more dominant older character stepped in and fought crime with Lady Bug. I already settled with this character being a Wolf, about 30 something years old and dominating the fuck out of the school girls in this setting. Expect a very different kind of Miraculous story if you undertake this with me. &amp;#x200B; **The Gray Jedi:** *The Star Wars Story* \- I don't always play Star Wars stories but when I do I am Gray Jedi Master who fucks his padawans. Really though most Star Wars plots are great but I prefer the Old Republic over any other setting. Multiple padwans are desired in this setting. OC characters are great. Canon women are more then welcome. &amp;#x200B; **The King of the North:** *A* *Game of Thrones* \- I do A LOT of retcons on Game of Thrones and 95% of them are saving a hot female from a untimely death. Moving beyond that I usually explore a plot where Jon Snow becomes a dominant stud and starts to build an empire in the North and in the wombs of any woman he see's fit. The means of corruption usually comes from Ygritte shooting some arrows into him only this time the arrows are poisoned and he gets changed by the experience. Does he get bigger and stronger? Just a massive cock? Maybe he turns into Wolf or Dragon? Who knows! Well I do but I mean what do you want from this story. &amp;#x200B; **Lord of Columbia**: *A Bioshock Story* \- Elizabeth from Bioshock might be one of my top 10 females from video games; Lara Croft, Sarah Kerrigan, and Tali'Zorah also make that list. What makes me want to put her on this list? Reality hopping. I love the idea of her teaming up with her Daddy (Booker) and helping him find other versions of her and making them his. Its perverted, incestous and has themes of ageplay, harems, and breeding but I fucking love it. Even more so if he takes Rapture as well. This is pretty much for pervs who love Bioshock as much as me. &amp;#x200B; **Normandy Harem:** *Mass Effect Story* \- There are three avenues to make Shepard become 'evil'. Cerberus Nanites, Collector Parasites, or Reaper Indoctrination Device. I tend to prefer the first option but the result always leads him to fucking the women of the Normandy. Is this plot not your thing? I have ideas for Andromeda and a clone program that makes a bunch of female Shepards. &amp;#x200B; **Symbiote Chronicles**: *A Spider-man Story* \- I find Peter Parker, bit of a Gary Stu. I actually really enjoyed how human they made him in Enter the Spider-Verse. I am getting off track. Point is, I play a more human Spider-man. He's not smarter then Stark, he cant lift two tanks, and he cant shoot a web faster then hammer of a pistol after the trigger is pulled. I am off track again. Spider-Man. Sexual Deviant. Venom Symbiote. Lots of Sex. Mary Jane. Gwen Stacey. Snoo Snoo. You get the idea. &amp;#x200B; **Tongue of the Dragon:** *A Skyrim Story* \- A shelved story idea I been to fucking lazy to finish. Sexy Dragon Shouts. Is it possible? Actually yeah the vocab is there but I haven't spent the time to put together a list of perverted shouts. Shouts that would rip armor off a female warriors body, make a person instantly more submissive or make them susceptible to mind control. It should be noted &amp;#x200B; **Vault Alpha:** *A Fallout Story* \- I have about 10 Vaults I made for the Fallout setting. Hands down my favorite is Vault Alpha also known as a cultural preservation vault. A girls school with a bunch of students from all over the world (including communist China) and their cultures knowledge saved with them. Of course, there was a boys school with same objective but they didn't survive (or did they?) but with the tunnel joining the vaults collapsed they wont find out anytime soon. Its a fun take on Fallout and one I love to explore. If thats not your thing guess what? I got more fucking fallout plots! &amp;#x200B; **Other Canon** \- Honestly the list of games, books, movies, shows, cartoon, anime, and comics goes on forever. Make a list of your favorites from those listed media mediums and present them in conversation. I will let you know which ones I know and are willing to play. I freely admit my anime/manga selection is limited to mostly what comes across Adult Swim. # Generic Stories **Angels &amp; Demons** \- Summoning an Incubus, Hell on Earth with angels and demons fighting for souls, a taboo coupling of angel and demon, and more. I love a good Heaven and Hell story. &amp;#x200B; **Cyber/Bio/Nanopunk** \- I tend to lean towards criminals, hackers, ex-military types, and noir style detectives. I always loved these setting where humanity has blurred the lines between man and machine and began to twist his DNA to suit his needs. &amp;#x200B; **CYOA** \- There are now lewd CYOA's that exist online. If you have something that gets you nice and wet feel free to share. I have a F-list profile dedicated to my collection. &amp;#x200B; **End of the World/Post Apoc** \- Gritty stories where the world has ended by drought, plague, radiation, virus or even the undead. While I would never wish this on humanity it does bring peoples character to the surface. Are you a Criminal? A Survivor? A reluctant hero? A submissive? The end of the world will let you know. &amp;#x200B; **Fantasy** \- Orcs, Centaurs, Elves, and Demons! Oh my! I personally love Conquest plots where kingdoms fall to invaders who take the spoils. Other stories like a demonic curse or princess in hiding also interest me. &amp;#x200B; **Fairy Tales** \- I love a good folk tale! We can keep it in the fantasy setting or shift it to a modern setting. Alternatively I been exploring polytheistic gods in the same lense as Fairy Tales, so if you want to see stories about Zeus. Let me know. &amp;#x200B; **Furries** \- Oh god he rights furry stories as well? Yeah I fucking do. I am a Big Bad Wolf who ruts foxes and bunnies wanna fight about it? &amp;#x200B; **Free Use World** \- A popular choice on Reddit where people are used freely in society for sexual purposes. I can get behind this sort of plot with the right people and in the right setting. Come with a good reason for society become so sexually open. &amp;#x200B; **Holiday** \- Christmas, Halloween, Easter, Etc. I have a profile dedicated to Holiday stories on F-list. I am willing to indulge in the festivities here. If you wanna get fucked in a Halloween costume? I got you. Want to be wrapped in a big bow for Christmas? Of course. Wanna get dominated by an anthro easter bunny? I'm your man. &amp;#x200B; **Incest** \- I have a lewd soft spot for Brother/Sister and Father/Daughter plots myself. Not against Uncle/Niece or Son/Mother either. If a story has family members as characters, I am more than willing to explore those perverted couplings. &amp;#x200B; **Interracial** \- This is a tough one only because racism is still a real thing and I walk this fine line between playing interracial motivated scenes and some stereotypes. There are real bigots online who solely get off on racist scenes and cant separate a short fantasy from respecting and caring for other people in the real world. If you find yourself believe racist beliefs and taking that as you personal social/political view. I am not the man for you. &amp;#x200B; **Military/Spies** \- Gritty settings mostly set in the middle east these days. I enjoy the occasional boots on the ground story where soldiers let off steam while in a secluded base. I admit I added zombies to these military plots a few times. Spies are little more different, located in the cities and focuses on the spy craft itself. &amp;#x200B; **Modern Fantasy** \- Magical wielders hidden in plain sight in the modern world. This includes Elves hiding their ears, vampires in a modern setting, men locking themselves in shipping containers under a full moon, or immortal gods running their own companies. The possibilities are endless. &amp;#x200B; **Monsters** \- I can play a werewolf, incubus, tentacle fiend, or whatever for your personal cravings. Monsters can be fun if done right and unlike most settings it can be done fantasy, modern or scifi no problem. &amp;#x200B; **Slasher** \- Been kicking around the idea of a sexy slasher setting. Big scary 'killer' hunting teens only instead of murdering them he fucks them senseless. Maybe they are fucked so hard they are knocked out for hours or start to like the slasher with that giant cock. I dont know. &amp;#x200B; **Space Opera** \- Space marines, derelict ship with aliens on-board, colonization missions, or just a ragtag crew taking on odd jobs. I love me a good space story! &amp;#x200B; **Steam/Diesel/Atom/Clockpunk** \- A fun setting that I mostly write with furry characters. The main reason why we love these settings? Personal sky ships, fashion and a sense of adventure. Great backdrop for a lewd story. &amp;#x200B; **Super Heroes** \- We can either use canon heroes or make up our own heroes for some super powered sex scenes. I usually play a Batman Esq hero myself but if you want me to fly and fuck you so hard we take down a building I am down. &amp;#x200B; **Supernatural** \- Be it the occult, witchcraft, demons, ancient books or artifacts or whatever. I have a Templar who's managed to survive hundreds of years as a potential champion for the story of our choosing. If you love the Supernatural we can expand on it together. &amp;#x200B; **Toons** \- We all love cartoons and I am more than willing to explore the hundereds of lovely characters given to us in Cartoons. We can write a story with the Power Puff Girls or we can have a plot where we live in a cartoon reality (Like Cool World) where physics are suggestions and the only way to kill a toon is with a eraser. &amp;#x200B; **Westerns** \- I found Westerns are pretty hard plots to get off the ground. When I have written plots like this its mostly bounty hunting or building a homestead with a strong female and her son. I only have a few working ideas for this setting so meet me half way on the brainstorming. &amp;#x200B; **Witches &amp; Warlocks** \- After watching that new Sabrina, witchcraft has been on my mind. If you want to explore a setting that explores Witchcraft be in our modern world or Hogwarts I am down. &amp;#x200B; **Other Settings** \- I probably missed some things like Tron, Gor, Robots, and historical periods. If you have something you like feel free to suggest it. Worse case scenario is me saying ""No Thanks"" and suggesting something else. Be creative and feel free to mix and match ideas like Cyberpunk and Zombies, sounds fucking awesome to me. # Top Kinks * **Ageplay** \- Loli's and Jailbait to Milfs and Dilfs. I like ageplay in my stories (depending on the plot) and so should you. It's not mandatory but if want to up your chances to play with me you need to be ok with this kink. * **Breeding/Pregnancy** \- Not sure when I developed this kink but I love the idea of knocking up my companions. Its the connection that it creates putting a baby in a fertile womb. I am down to explore this kink all the way up to birth, such scenes involving that should happen off screen. * **Corruption** \- Just like Transformation but changing of the mind. I like moving the dial of characters morality and personality in a story. My favorite is a Lawful Good male becoming a Deviant Dominating Pervert. He doesnt need to be evil, he just needs to value sex over people. * **Domination** \- I like to be in control in most stories. Master/Slave, Daddy/Daughter, Alpha/Omega and so on. I dont mind stories that involve scenes where I am submissive but there is no chance I will do a plot where I remain that way. Where I dont turn the tables and take control of the woman who thought she was the mistress. * **Harem Play** \- Needless to say I am kind of greedy. I like plots where I claim multiple girls. If you think thats unfair, let me remind you I GM/DM 99% of my stories so the work load is more often then not on my shoulders. If you're willing to play a harem for me, you get to move to the front of the line. * **Incest** \- A family that plays together. Stays together. Incest is not a must but I love to have it appear in most plots. Improve your chances of playing by agreeing to exploring this kink. * **Interracial** \- I love a good mix of skin colors in the bedroom. I love the cultural differences and exploring how people fit. However, if you I think you are a real racist; MAGA hat wearing Neo Nazi Trump voter. You can go fuck yourself. * **Mind Control** \- Closely related to corruption. I love playing with mind control. It can be easy like swinging a gem in front of your face until your under a trance or it can be hard like me slowly reprogramming your mind by altering memories. I enjoy both fantastical snap your fingers mind control and the realistic subliminal music/image approach that takes effect over time. * **Transformation** \- There is something about getting bigger, thicker, stronger, or turning from man to beast that turns me on. I like it when it happens to me. I like it when it happens to you. Most my stories have TF to varying degrees. # Closing So there you have it my long winded post to catch quality female players like you. Reddit isn't a great space to hunt for female players if only because there are 10 to 1 male to female ratio and lesser males love to downvote other \[M4F\] posts above/below their own. If you have read this full post; Good Job, Gold Star! Shoot me a Message (Reddit chat is hot garbage), if we click well we will move this party to Discord where hopefully we will play for a very very long time. &amp;#x200B; Lewd Regards, **Master of Perversion** ^(P.S.

No players under 18 please. Thanks.\*\** \**\*Note: I wont always be 'In The Mood' to play all my stories. Suggest a list of your favorites.\*\** # About Me Hey there my name is **Master of Perversions** or **Perversions** for short. I am a long time roleplayer who has been writing erotic stories for nearly 20+ years now, so needless to say I am experienced and have lots of lewd ideas. If you want some more personal info on me. I am a 33 California native, I am over six feet tall, I am in good shape (go to the gym, run, soocer, rock-climb), and I am progressive meaning I respect women but I also am very dominant in the bedroom. I am pretty open book willing to share about myself and I hope to meet partners who feel the same. # Requirements So now you know about me and you want to grab my attention? There are some elements I think make female players stand out above their peers and keep me interested. If you check off all (or most) of the items on this list than you will have me very interested. * **Creative/Geeky/Perverted Female** \- The three corner stones of a perfect female player. She should be creative enough to run with ideas, geeky enough to lots of canon she can draw inspiration from and perverted enough to get behind my lewd kinks. * **Playing on Discord** \- I pretty much play exclusively on Discord now. With the private servers, easy image sharing, and being able to edit a post after its sent. Its easily THE BEST application for roleplay. Reddit is good for initial PM only. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female? That won't cut it for me. If your trans? You can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling a connection or not. Gender, Orientation, and Sexuality is complex. I wont ask you to conform to my sexuality and you shouldn't force me to conform to yours. * **Switch or Submissive** \- I don't mind rolling in bed with a woman who likes to take control but I like to be the dom in the bedroom. I am not saying NO to dominant woman, just understand my goal is to make you mine. * **Flexible Age Range** \- Stories often have a variety of characters differing in age, expect to have underage characters in these stories. If you have issues with ageplay we can make them NPC style characters who are present but don't get involved in sex. The more flexible your age range are the better your chances. * **Multiple Characters** \- The stories I write are... complex. I often take on a DM/GM role writing the world with multiple characters (I wont say no to a female DM/GMing for me). If you are a player who can ONLY write one character, I mean no offense but your skill level isn't high enough to play in these sort of plots.. * **Open Book Players** \- I want to get to know you. I will ask you A/S/L, your first name and some other personal questions about who you are. That said, **I** **WILL NEVER** ask for your phone number, personal email, where you work, or your last name. There are details that can be shared that preserve your anonymity online and others that compromise it. I aim to protect you (and myself) asking things that wont give away who you truly are. Unless we reach that level of trust and respect and decide to get closer. * **Quantity and Quality** \- Writing a quality post can be difficult. There are various elements that can undermine a post. Repeating what I said in your post, not adding anything new to the scene, god modding characters (AKA Mary Suing), one liner responses, and the list goes on. I am willing to invest time and effort into playing with you, I don't think its unfair to ask you to do the same with me. * **Hard No Kinks** \- I will NOT humor ANY of these kinks, I wont shame you but having these any where in your prompt history will discourage me from playing with you: Diapers/Infantilism, Snuff, Mutilation/Nullification, Gore, Obese/Fat/Hyper Fat, Vomiting, Gas/Farting, Blood, Scat, STD's, Popping, Prolapsing, and Toilet Play. If a kink relates to this list then I probably don't want to involve it. # Original Stories **Body Shifters** \- The Body Shifters are a 'female' alien species that live for/crave/eat cum in order to stay healthy. They can alter their bodies at will changing size, shape, color, and clothes at a thought. They are loyal to their human lovers who they feed off of by fucking/sucking all day long. Our story will follow one of this lucky males who gets hooked up with one of these alien babes and trying to keep her a secret while his life becomes one of sex and keeping his alien girls happy. Oh did I mention the more you feed them that they eventually get so big that they split into two new girls? Yeah... that happens. &amp;#x200B; **Castaways** \- A simple plot of either crash landing or being shipwrecked on a deserted island (or planet if Scifi setting). I always liked the concept of being alone and working hard to survive. Of course as a erotic roleplay a guy on a island by himself jerking off is pretty boring, so we are gonna have some girls wash up on that island with him! What will they find on the island? Who knows. Could be amazon tribe, a lost fertility goddess, the fountain of youth, human sized venus fly taps with tentacles, or mind/body altering plants that make us into animals. The possibilities are endless but the premises is always the same. &amp;#x200B; **Dawn of the Breasts** \- Its basically a zombie story only instead of rotting corpses ravaging people, the infected are naked horny and feral bimbos/himbos. No killing needed for this plot all it takes is some cum, breast milk or saliva to start someones inevitable fall to this very sexy disease. Transformation plays a big role here were people take a load and start to put on hyper fertile curves before chasing down their friends and family to turn them as well. There are lots of places to start a story like which makes it highly erotic and versatile. &amp;#x200B; **Dirty Politics** \- A recent idea I been playing with is exploring someones rise to power in the modern political age. He can either be a brilliant politician or have mind control abilities allowing him to get what he needs/wants done quickly. Politically speaking his ideas are often for the best of society and does right by the people but behind closed doors he will make his opponents daughters his own personal sluts to spy on their fathers and help him build a empire of influence under his enemies noses. We may even use famous politicians to do it. &amp;#x200B; **Fertile Valley** \- If you read erotica on the web then you likely came across Fertile Valley. While not every aspect of the original story turned me on the concept of a small secluded town affected by their tainted water supply was something that stuck with me. I am looking for a imagining of this plot with a federal agent moving to the town to find out what the fuck is going on only to have the effects start to alter him and his family. The question is will he stop it before he is too far gone or will he give into the pleasure and embrace the communities incestuous culture? Only one way to find out. &amp;#x200B; **La Resistance** \- A story for all you history lovers out there who love period pieces. La Resistance follows the French Resistance in Paris during WW2. The general plot of the story follows a OSS Operative from the US sent into France to help establish the resistance and help them defeat the Nazis. The team he build will be mostly (if not all) female operatives from various walks of life. I have some characters already created and while French girl is the largest group we also have German, English, Irish, Russian, and American girls among the list of playable characters. If this interests you let me know and I can share what I have written so far. &amp;#x200B; **Man With All The Gifts** \- A relatively generic plot considering all the other stories on the list. I bachelor, father, divorced dad, and/or teacher is given a new lot in life be in magic, miracle pill, alien ray gun, or body altering nanites or whatever. Whatever starts the changes it will allow him to become more over time and eventually make him a demi-god among men. Naturally as any demi-god would do, he starts to claim the women of his life! Coworkers, old girlfriends, ex-wife, daughters, daughters friends, neighbors and so on. It's really a male power fantasy but I find a fair amount of female players wanting to be claimed by a true alpha. An there arnt any bigger alphas than him! &amp;#x200B; **I Love Puazi** \- The Puazi are an alien species who moved to earth to cohabitate with humanity. Thats the general setting in a nutshell. The fun part about the Puazi is their biology makes them really into the smells of earth mammals, primarily humans. The musk makes them sway on their feet, go cross eyed and crave that drug that is a human climax in their mouth. If you don't know the Puazi, I would suggest googling Puazi Incase and getting to know the source material! I promise its worth the read of those lewd comics. &amp;#x200B; **Only We Remain** \- If you get to know me, you will find that I have a deep affection for zombie plots. The scavenging, rebuilding, survival, and fighting create a very compelling plot. Only We Remain (Parodyish title of the Last of Us) follows a alien spore that starts converting men into undead monsters. Its harder to elaborate on then other stories as I have infected types, locations, survivor groups, and the science of infection pretty clearly laid out. If you want a true zombie survival plot that is 2/3rds plots and 1/3rd sex? This is the best plot for you. &amp;#x200B; **Rise of the Wolves** \- Jay Naylor put out a comic called the Fall of Little Red Riding Hood which gave life to that old tale. The Wolves were a tribe and they discovered that humans were quite breedable and made wonderful fleshy lovers. In that vain, I plan to explore the source content more fully writing out a plot of how the Wolves begin to take human settlements and make humanity their literal bitches. Its a wonderful anthro on human story line, it has lots of corruption and even transformation play involved. If you want to get fucked by literal big bad wolfs, this is a good plot for you. &amp;#x200B; **Supernatural Girlfriend AKA My Little Succubus** \- A general story I been working on is slice of life story with Succubus Girlfriend. As I continued to write this setting I started to think about other potential Super Natural Lovers. A Vampire Girlfriend who requires to feed on me from time to time and loves to watch movies all night, a Ghost Girlfriend who is around the time but is never really there, an Orc Girlfriend who is as strong as me and really loves sports but has a temper. Its clever collection of couples in a modern setting exploring how we 'click' as lovers. If you want to play multiple girlfriends I wont say no to such a story, I also have supernatural boyfriends encase you want to be human female with her hung werewolf boyfriend or whatever. &amp;#x200B; **Wincestor House** \- Wincestor House is a basically a haunted mansion or manor that has sexualized ghosts who to fuck the family that moves in. This is easily my most incestuous plot on the list and has things like possession, phantom lovers, flashbacks to other lives, and living objects involved in the plot. I try not to make it a horror movie but nor do I want it to be boring or tame. Its somewhere between House on Haunted Hill, Crimson Peak, Poltergeist and pinch of Casper with a big scoop of porn. I have a primary plot focused on the occult and witchcraft connected to family sex but that plot isnt for everyone so ask me what other options I have if that's not your thing. &amp;#x200B; **Other Originals** \- I have dozens of other plots unposted. Alpha Formula - Chemical turns man into a half man/half wolf beast. Family Farm - A family is turned into beasts of burden on their own farm. Invasion of the Space Futa - Alien Amazons with Cocks invade earth. Master PC - Reality altering PC program changes peoples reality with a few times. And the list goes on. If you have ideas of your own feel free to share, I might have a plot for that. # Canon Stories **The 13 Kingdoms**: *A Disney Story* \- The various Disney Girls reimagined in a interconnected world that plays a lot like with Lord of the Rings with a fair amount of strong female characters. I typically play ""The Big Bad Wolf"" in these stories as a former hero who was twisted by dark powers and now resides in a gray area where he is neither trusted by the Princesses or the Wicked Witches. We can discuss where you might like to take this plot. &amp;#x200B; **Apex**: *A Overwatch Story* \- A new villain called APEX emerges as a nanite infused human who seeks to get revenge on the members of Overwatch and steal their tech. There is no doubt he will enslave them making them into wanton sluts once he has their way with them. Certain characters hold high value like Tracers whos chest plate will allow APEX to distort time. The more he claims the more dangerous he becomes. Will Overwatch and Talon join forces to stop this new foe who seeks to rule the world? &amp;#x200B; **Big Bad Wolf:** *A Witcher Story* \- Geralt is one of the stronger male characters in the past 20 years. I would love to do a simple story with him hunting monsters and having various romantic encounters. If that doesnt scratch your itch he can be corrupted by a perverted mutagen or come down a case of the Werewolfs before breeding Yen, Triss, and Ciri. Please at least know the video games. &amp;#x200B; **Darkest Night**: *A Batman Story* \- Batman isn't terribly interesting but he is fit, smart, rich and in my stories hung. I like a good plot where he is corrupted by Ivy into her equal or a injection from Harley that makes him lose control. The how/why are flexible but what happens after is always the same. He starts to fuck the hell out of the women of Gotham and he takes the best ones back to Wayne Manor to be his harem of super women. &amp;#x200B; **Distant Corners:** *A Star Trek Story* \- I been super eager to meet a female Trekkie who wants to build and OC crew and explore the universe. This is nothing short of an undertaking and we need to be sure we click as players before investing the time and energy into populating a crew. If done right we will have a strong female crew getting into sexy adventures in no time! &amp;#x200B; **Emerging Reality**: *A Marvel/DC Story* \- I been exploring the merging of universes them with Marvel/DC coming together. I even added Overwatch, Lara Croft, Ben 10 and other settings to the same universe. The means changes from the Infinity Stones merging worlds or some other macguffin causing the realities to merge. My favorite character to play is Green Lantern and I have merged him once with Peter Parker making a new character. Super Flexible here with who the lead male can be and where we take the plot. &amp;#x200B; **Fang:** *A Miraculous Story* \- I watched this show with my niece and thought it be fun to write a story where a more dominant older character stepped in and fought crime with Lady Bug. I already settled with this character being a Wolf, about 30 something years old and dominating the fuck out of the school girls in this setting. Expect a very different kind of Miraculous story if you undertake this with me. &amp;#x200B; **The Gray Jedi:** *The Star Wars Story* \- I don't always play Star Wars stories but when I do I am Gray Jedi Master who fucks his padawans. Really though most Star Wars plots are great but I prefer the Old Republic over any other setting. Multiple padwans are desired in this setting. OC characters are great. Canon women are more then welcome. &amp;#x200B; **The King of the North:** *A* *Game of Thrones* \- I do A LOT of retcons on Game of Thrones and 95% of them are saving a hot female from a untimely death. Moving beyond that I usually explore a plot where Jon Snow becomes a dominant stud and starts to build an empire in the North and in the wombs of any woman he see's fit. The means of corruption usually comes from Ygritte shooting some arrows into him only this time the arrows are poisoned and he gets changed by the experience. Does he get bigger and stronger? Just a massive cock? Maybe he turns into Wolf or Dragon? Who knows! Well I do but I mean what do you want from this story. &amp;#x200B; **Lord of Columbia**: *A Bioshock Story* \- Elizabeth from Bioshock might be one of my top 10 females from video games; Lara Croft, Sarah Kerrigan, and Tali'Zorah also make that list. What makes me want to put her on this list? Reality hopping. I love the idea of her teaming up with her Daddy (Booker) and helping him find other versions of her and making them his. Its perverted, incestous and has themes of ageplay, harems, and breeding but I fucking love it. Even more so if he takes Rapture as well. This is pretty much for pervs who love Bioshock as much as me. &amp;#x200B; **Normandy Harem:** *Mass Effect Story* \- There are three avenues to make Shepard become 'evil'. Cerberus Nanites, Collector Parasites, or Reaper Indoctrination Device. I tend to prefer the first option but the result always leads him to fucking the women of the Normandy. Is this plot not your thing? I have ideas for Andromeda and a clone program that makes a bunch of female Shepards. &amp;#x200B; **Symbiote Chronicles**: *A Spider-man Story* \- I find Peter Parker, bit of a Gary Stu. I actually really enjoyed how human they made him in Enter the Spider-Verse. I am getting off track. Point is, I play a more human Spider-man. He's not smarter then Stark, he cant lift two tanks, and he cant shoot a web faster then hammer of a pistol after the trigger is pulled. I am off track again. Spider-Man. Sexual Deviant. Venom Symbiote. Lots of Sex. Mary Jane. Gwen Stacey. Snoo Snoo. You get the idea. &amp;#x200B; **Tongue of the Dragon:** *A Skyrim Story* \- A shelved story idea I been to fucking lazy to finish. Sexy Dragon Shouts. Is it possible? Actually yeah the vocab is there but I haven't spent the time to put together a list of perverted shouts. Shouts that would rip armor off a female warriors body, make a person instantly more submissive or make them susceptible to mind control. It should be noted &amp;#x200B; **Vault Alpha:** *A Fallout Story* \- I have about 10 Vaults I made for the Fallout setting. Hands down my favorite is Vault Alpha also known as a cultural preservation vault. A girls school with a bunch of students from all over the world (including communist China) and their cultures knowledge saved with them. Of course, there was a boys school with same objective but they didn't survive (or did they?) but with the tunnel joining the vaults collapsed they wont find out anytime soon. Its a fun take on Fallout and one I love to explore. If thats not your thing guess what? I got more fucking fallout plots! &amp;#x200B; **Other Canon** \- Honestly the list of games, books, movies, shows, cartoon, anime, and comics goes on forever. Make a list of your favorites from those listed media mediums and present them in conversation. I will let you know which ones I know and are willing to play. I freely admit my anime/manga selection is limited to mostly what comes across Adult Swim. # Generic Stories **Angels &amp; Demons** \- Summoning an Incubus, Hell on Earth with angels and demons fighting for souls, a taboo coupling of angel and demon, and more. I love a good Heaven and Hell story. &amp;#x200B; **Cyber/Bio/Nanopunk** \- I tend to lean towards criminals, hackers, ex-military types, and noir style detectives. I always loved these setting where humanity has blurred the lines between man and machine and began to twist his DNA to suit his needs. &amp;#x200B; **CYOA** \- There are now lewd CYOA's that exist online. If you have something that gets you nice and wet feel free to share. I have a F-list profile dedicated to my collection. &amp;#x200B; **End of the World/Post Apoc** \- Gritty stories where the world has ended by drought, plague, radiation, virus or even the undead. While I would never wish this on humanity it does bring peoples character to the surface. Are you a Criminal? A Survivor? A reluctant hero? A submissive? The end of the world will let you know. &amp;#x200B; **Fantasy** \- Orcs, Centaurs, Elves, and Demons! Oh my! I personally love Conquest plots where kingdoms fall to invaders who take the spoils. Other stories like a demonic curse or princess in hiding also interest me. &amp;#x200B; **Fairy Tales** \- I love a good folk tale! We can keep it in the fantasy setting or shift it to a modern setting. Alternatively I been exploring polytheistic gods in the same lense as Fairy Tales, so if you want to see stories about Zeus. Let me know. &amp;#x200B; **Furries** \- Oh god he rights furry stories as well? Yeah I fucking do. I am a Big Bad Wolf who ruts foxes and bunnies wanna fight about it? &amp;#x200B; **Free Use World** \- A popular choice on Reddit where people are used freely in society for sexual purposes. I can get behind this sort of plot with the right people and in the right setting. Come with a good reason for society become so sexually open. &amp;#x200B; **Holiday** \- Christmas, Halloween, Easter, Etc. I have a profile dedicated to Holiday stories on F-list. I am willing to indulge in the festivities here. If you wanna get fucked in a Halloween costume? I got you. Want to be wrapped in a big bow for Christmas? Of course. Wanna get dominated by an anthro easter bunny? I'm your man. &amp;#x200B; **Incest** \- I have a lewd soft spot for Brother/Sister and Father/Daughter plots myself. Not against Uncle/Niece or Son/Mother either. If a story has family members as characters, I am more than willing to explore those perverted couplings. &amp;#x200B; **Interracial** \- This is a tough one only because racism is still a real thing and I walk this fine line between playing interracial motivated scenes and some stereotypes. There are real bigots online who solely get off on racist scenes and cant separate a short fantasy from respecting and caring for other people in the real world. If you find yourself believe racist beliefs and taking that as you personal social/political view. I am not the man for you. &amp;#x200B; **Military/Spies** \- Gritty settings mostly set in the middle east these days. I enjoy the occasional boots on the ground story where soldiers let off steam while in a secluded base. I admit I added zombies to these military plots a few times. Spies are little more different, located in the cities and focuses on the spy craft itself. &amp;#x200B; **Modern Fantasy** \- Magical wielders hidden in plain sight in the modern world. This includes Elves hiding their ears, vampires in a modern setting, men locking themselves in shipping containers under a full moon, or immortal gods running their own companies. The possibilities are endless. &amp;#x200B; **Monsters** \- I can play a werewolf, incubus, tentacle fiend, or whatever for your personal cravings. Monsters can be fun if done right and unlike most settings it can be done fantasy, modern or scifi no problem. &amp;#x200B; **Slasher** \- Been kicking around the idea of a sexy slasher setting. Big scary 'killer' hunting teens only instead of murdering them he fucks them senseless. Maybe they are fucked so hard they are knocked out for hours or start to like the slasher with that giant cock. I dont know. &amp;#x200B; **Space Opera** \- Space marines, derelict ship with aliens on-board, colonization missions, or just a ragtag crew taking on odd jobs. I love me a good space story! &amp;#x200B; **Steam/Diesel/Atom/Clockpunk** \- A fun setting that I mostly write with furry characters. The main reason why we love these settings? Personal sky ships, fashion and a sense of adventure. Great backdrop for a lewd story. &amp;#x200B; **Super Heroes** \- We can either use canon heroes or make up our own heroes for some super powered sex scenes. I usually play a Batman Esq hero myself but if you want me to fly and fuck you so hard we take down a building I am down. &amp;#x200B; **Supernatural** \- Be it the occult, witchcraft, demons, ancient books or artifacts or whatever. I have a Templar who's managed to survive hundreds of years as a potential champion for the story of our choosing. If you love the Supernatural we can expand on it together. &amp;#x200B; **Toons** \- We all love cartoons and I am more than willing to explore the hundereds of lovely characters given to us in Cartoons. We can write a story with the Power Puff Girls or we can have a plot where we live in a cartoon reality (Like Cool World) where physics are suggestions and the only way to kill a toon is with a eraser. &amp;#x200B; **Westerns** \- I found Westerns are pretty hard plots to get off the ground. When I have written plots like this its mostly bounty hunting or building a homestead with a strong female and her son. I only have a few working ideas for this setting so meet me half way on the brainstorming. &amp;#x200B; **Witches &amp; Warlocks** \- After watching that new Sabrina, witchcraft has been on my mind. If you want to explore a setting that explores Witchcraft be in our modern world or Hogwarts I am down. &amp;#x200B; **Other Settings** \- I probably missed some things like Tron, Gor, Robots, and historical periods. If you have something you like feel free to suggest it. Worse case scenario is me saying ""No Thanks"" and suggesting something else. Be creative and feel free to mix and match ideas like Cyberpunk and Zombies, sounds fucking awesome to me. # Top Kinks * **Ageplay** \- Loli's and Jailbait to Milfs and Dilfs. I like ageplay in my stories (depending on the plot) and so should you. It's not mandatory but if want to up your chances to play with me you need to be ok with this kink. * **Breeding/Pregnancy** \- Not sure when I developed this kink but I love the idea of knocking up my companions. Its the connection that it creates putting a baby in a fertile womb. I am down to explore this kink all the way up to birth, such scenes involving that should happen off screen. * **Corruption** \- Just like Transformation but changing of the mind. I like moving the dial of characters morality and personality in a story. My favorite is a Lawful Good male becoming a Deviant Dominating Pervert. He doesnt need to be evil, he just needs to value sex over people. * **Domination** \- I like to be in control in most stories. Master/Slave, Daddy/Daughter, Alpha/Omega and so on. I dont mind stories that involve scenes where I am submissive but there is no chance I will do a plot where I remain that way. Where I dont turn the tables and take control of the woman who thought she was the mistress. * **Harem Play** \- Needless to say I am kind of greedy. I like plots where I claim multiple girls. If you think thats unfair, let me remind you I GM/DM 99% of my stories so the work load is more often then not on my shoulders. If you're willing to play a harem for me, you get to move to the front of the line. * **Incest** \- A family that plays together. Stays together. Incest is not a must but I love to have it appear in most plots. Improve your chances of playing by agreeing to exploring this kink. * **Interracial** \- I love a good mix of skin colors in the bedroom. I love the cultural differences and exploring how people fit. However, if you I think you are a real racist; MAGA hat wearing Neo Nazi Trump voter. You can go fuck yourself. * **Mind Control** \- Closely related to corruption. I love playing with mind control. It can be easy like swinging a gem in front of your face until your under a trance or it can be hard like me slowly reprogramming your mind by altering memories. I enjoy both fantastical snap your fingers mind control and the realistic subliminal music/image approach that takes effect over time. * **Transformation** \- There is something about getting bigger, thicker, stronger, or turning from man to beast that turns me on. I like it when it happens to me. I like it when it happens to you. Most my stories have TF to varying degrees. # Closing So there you have it my long winded post to catch quality female players like you. Reddit isn't a great space to hunt for female players if only because there are 10 to 1 male to female ratio and lesser males love to downvote other \[M4F\] posts above/below their own. If you have read this full post; Good Job, Gold Star! Shoot me a Message (Reddit chat is hot garbage), if we click well we will move this party to Discord where hopefully we will play for a very very long time. &amp;#x200B; Lewd Regards, **Master of Perversion** ^(P.S.

I am a long time roleplayer who has been writing erotic stories for nearly 20+ years now, so needless to say I am experienced and have lots of lewd ideas. If you want some more personal info on me. I am a 33 California native, I am over six feet tall, I am in good shape (go to the gym, run, soocer, rock-climb), and I am progressive meaning I respect women but I also am very dominant in the bedroom. I am pretty open book willing to share about myself and I hope to meet partners who feel the same. # Requirements So now you know about me and you want to grab my attention? There are some elements I think make female players stand out above their peers and keep me interested. If you check off all (or most) of the items on this list than you will have me very interested. * **Creative/Geeky/Perverted Female** \- The three corner stones of a perfect female player. She should be creative enough to run with ideas, geeky enough to lots of canon she can draw inspiration from and perverted enough to get behind my lewd kinks. * **Playing on Discord** \- I pretty much play exclusively on Discord now. With the private servers, easy image sharing, and being able to edit a post after its sent. Its easily THE BEST application for roleplay. Reddit is good for initial PM only. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female? That won't cut it for me. If your trans? You can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling a connection or not. Gender, Orientation, and Sexuality is complex. I wont ask you to conform to my sexuality and you shouldn't force me to conform to yours. * **Switch or Submissive** \- I don't mind rolling in bed with a woman who likes to take control but I like to be the dom in the bedroom. I am not saying NO to dominant woman, just understand my goal is to make you mine. * **Flexible Age Range** \- Stories often have a variety of characters differing in age, expect to have underage characters in these stories. If you have issues with ageplay we can make them NPC style characters who are present but don't get involved in sex. The more flexible your age range are the better your chances. * **Multiple Characters** \- The stories I write are... complex. I often take on a DM/GM role writing the world with multiple characters (I wont say no to a female DM/GMing for me). If you are a player who can ONLY write one character, I mean no offense but your skill level isn't high enough to play in these sort of plots.. * **Open Book Players** \- I want to get to know you. I will ask you A/S/L, your first name and some other personal questions about who you are. That said, **I** **WILL NEVER** ask for your phone number, personal email, where you work, or your last name. There are details that can be shared that preserve your anonymity online and others that compromise it. I aim to protect you (and myself) asking things that wont give away who you truly are. Unless we reach that level of trust and respect and decide to get closer. * **Quantity and Quality** \- Writing a quality post can be difficult. There are various elements that can undermine a post. Repeating what I said in your post, not adding anything new to the scene, god modding characters (AKA Mary Suing), one liner responses, and the list goes on. I am willing to invest time and effort into playing with you, I don't think its unfair to ask you to do the same with me. * **Hard No Kinks** \- I will NOT humor ANY of these kinks, I wont shame you but having these any where in your prompt history will discourage me from playing with you: Diapers/Infantilism, Snuff, Mutilation/Nullification, Gore, Obese/Fat/Hyper Fat, Vomiting, Gas/Farting, Blood, Scat, STD's, Popping, Prolapsing, and Toilet Play. If a kink relates to this list then I probably don't want to involve it. # Original Stories **Body Shifters** \- The Body Shifters are a 'female' alien species that live for/crave/eat cum in order to stay healthy. They can alter their bodies at will changing size, shape, color, and clothes at a thought. They are loyal to their human lovers who they feed off of by fucking/sucking all day long. Our story will follow one of this lucky males who gets hooked up with one of these alien babes and trying to keep her a secret while his life becomes one of sex and keeping his alien girls happy. Oh did I mention the more you feed them that they eventually get so big that they split into two new girls? Yeah... that happens. &amp;#x200B; **Castaways** \- A simple plot of either crash landing or being shipwrecked on a deserted island (or planet if Scifi setting). I always liked the concept of being alone and working hard to survive. Of course as a erotic roleplay a guy on a island by himself jerking off is pretty boring, so we are gonna have some girls wash up on that island with him! What will they find on the island? Who knows. Could be amazon tribe, a lost fertility goddess, the fountain of youth, human sized venus fly taps with tentacles, or mind/body altering plants that make us into animals. The possibilities are endless but the premises is always the same. &amp;#x200B; **Dawn of the Breasts** \- Its basically a zombie story only instead of rotting corpses ravaging people, the infected are naked horny and feral bimbos/himbos. No killing needed for this plot all it takes is some cum, breast milk or saliva to start someones inevitable fall to this very sexy disease. Transformation plays a big role here were people take a load and start to put on hyper fertile curves before chasing down their friends and family to turn them as well. There are lots of places to start a story like which makes it highly erotic and versatile. &amp;#x200B; **Dirty Politics** \- A recent idea I been playing with is exploring someones rise to power in the modern political age. He can either be a brilliant politician or have mind control abilities allowing him to get what he needs/wants done quickly. Politically speaking his ideas are often for the best of society and does right by the people but behind closed doors he will make his opponents daughters his own personal sluts to spy on their fathers and help him build a empire of influence under his enemies noses. We may even use famous politicians to do it. &amp;#x200B; **Fertile Valley** \- If you read erotica on the web then you likely came across Fertile Valley. While not every aspect of the original story turned me on the concept of a small secluded town affected by their tainted water supply was something that stuck with me. I am looking for a imagining of this plot with a federal agent moving to the town to find out what the fuck is going on only to have the effects start to alter him and his family. The question is will he stop it before he is too far gone or will he give into the pleasure and embrace the communities incestuous culture? Only one way to find out. &amp;#x200B; **La Resistance** \- A story for all you history lovers out there who love period pieces. La Resistance follows the French Resistance in Paris during WW2. The general plot of the story follows a OSS Operative from the US sent into France to help establish the resistance and help them defeat the Nazis. The team he build will be mostly (if not all) female operatives from various walks of life. I have some characters already created and while French girl is the largest group we also have German, English, Irish, Russian, and American girls among the list of playable characters. If this interests you let me know and I can share what I have written so far. &amp;#x200B; **Man With All The Gifts** \- A relatively generic plot considering all the other stories on the list. I bachelor, father, divorced dad, and/or teacher is given a new lot in life be in magic, miracle pill, alien ray gun, or body altering nanites or whatever. Whatever starts the changes it will allow him to become more over time and eventually make him a demi-god among men. Naturally as any demi-god would do, he starts to claim the women of his life! Coworkers, old girlfriends, ex-wife, daughters, daughters friends, neighbors and so on. It's really a male power fantasy but I find a fair amount of female players wanting to be claimed by a true alpha. An there arnt any bigger alphas than him! &amp;#x200B; **I Love Puazi** \- The Puazi are an alien species who moved to earth to cohabitate with humanity. Thats the general setting in a nutshell. The fun part about the Puazi is their biology makes them really into the smells of earth mammals, primarily humans. The musk makes them sway on their feet, go cross eyed and crave that drug that is a human climax in their mouth. If you don't know the Puazi, I would suggest googling Puazi Incase and getting to know the source material! I promise its worth the read of those lewd comics. &amp;#x200B; **Only We Remain** \- If you get to know me, you will find that I have a deep affection for zombie plots. The scavenging, rebuilding, survival, and fighting create a very compelling plot. Only We Remain (Parodyish title of the Last of Us) follows a alien spore that starts converting men into undead monsters. Its harder to elaborate on then other stories as I have infected types, locations, survivor groups, and the science of infection pretty clearly laid out. If you want a true zombie survival plot that is 2/3rds plots and 1/3rd sex? This is the best plot for you. &amp;#x200B; **Rise of the Wolves** \- Jay Naylor put out a comic called the Fall of Little Red Riding Hood which gave life to that old tale. The Wolves were a tribe and they discovered that humans were quite breedable and made wonderful fleshy lovers. In that vain, I plan to explore the source content more fully writing out a plot of how the Wolves begin to take human settlements and make humanity their literal bitches. Its a wonderful anthro on human story line, it has lots of corruption and even transformation play involved. If you want to get fucked by literal big bad wolfs, this is a good plot for you. &amp;#x200B; **Supernatural Girlfriend AKA My Little Succubus** \- A general story I been working on is slice of life story with Succubus Girlfriend. As I continued to write this setting I started to think about other potential Super Natural Lovers. A Vampire Girlfriend who requires to feed on me from time to time and loves to watch movies all night, a Ghost Girlfriend who is around the time but is never really there, an Orc Girlfriend who is as strong as me and really loves sports but has a temper. Its clever collection of couples in a modern setting exploring how we 'click' as lovers. If you want to play multiple girlfriends I wont say no to such a story, I also have supernatural boyfriends encase you want to be human female with her hung werewolf boyfriend or whatever. &amp;#x200B; **Wincestor House** \- Wincestor House is a basically a haunted mansion or manor that has sexualized ghosts who to fuck the family that moves in. This is easily my most incestuous plot on the list and has things like possession, phantom lovers, flashbacks to other lives, and living objects involved in the plot. I try not to make it a horror movie but nor do I want it to be boring or tame. Its somewhere between House on Haunted Hill, Crimson Peak, Poltergeist and pinch of Casper with a big scoop of porn. I have a primary plot focused on the occult and witchcraft connected to family sex but that plot isnt for everyone so ask me what other options I have if that's not your thing. &amp;#x200B; **Other Originals** \- I have dozens of other plots unposted. Alpha Formula - Chemical turns man into a half man/half wolf beast. Family Farm - A family is turned into beasts of burden on their own farm. Invasion of the Space Futa - Alien Amazons with Cocks invade earth. Master PC - Reality altering PC program changes peoples reality with a few times. And the list goes on. If you have ideas of your own feel free to share, I might have a plot for that. # Canon Stories **The 13 Kingdoms**: *A Disney Story* \- The various Disney Girls reimagined in a interconnected world that plays a lot like with Lord of the Rings with a fair amount of strong female characters. I typically play ""The Big Bad Wolf"" in these stories as a former hero who was twisted by dark powers and now resides in a gray area where he is neither trusted by the Princesses or the Wicked Witches. We can discuss where you might like to take this plot. &amp;#x200B; **Apex**: *A Overwatch Story* \- A new villain called APEX emerges as a nanite infused human who seeks to get revenge on the members of Overwatch and steal their tech. There is no doubt he will enslave them making them into wanton sluts once he has their way with them. Certain characters hold high value like Tracers whos chest plate will allow APEX to distort time. The more he claims the more dangerous he becomes. Will Overwatch and Talon join forces to stop this new foe who seeks to rule the world? &amp;#x200B; **Big Bad Wolf:** *A Witcher Story* \- Geralt is one of the stronger male characters in the past 20 years. I would love to do a simple story with him hunting monsters and having various romantic encounters. If that doesnt scratch your itch he can be corrupted by a perverted mutagen or come down a case of the Werewolfs before breeding Yen, Triss, and Ciri. Please at least know the video games. &amp;#x200B; **Darkest Night**: *A Batman Story* \- Batman isn't terribly interesting but he is fit, smart, rich and in my stories hung. I like a good plot where he is corrupted by Ivy into her equal or a injection from Harley that makes him lose control. The how/why are flexible but what happens after is always the same. He starts to fuck the hell out of the women of Gotham and he takes the best ones back to Wayne Manor to be his harem of super women. &amp;#x200B; **Distant Corners:** *A Star Trek Story* \- I been super eager to meet a female Trekkie who wants to build and OC crew and explore the universe. This is nothing short of an undertaking and we need to be sure we click as players before investing the time and energy into populating a crew. If done right we will have a strong female crew getting into sexy adventures in no time! &amp;#x200B; **Emerging Reality**: *A Marvel/DC Story* \- I been exploring the merging of universes them with Marvel/DC coming together. I even added Overwatch, Lara Croft, Ben 10 and other settings to the same universe. The means changes from the Infinity Stones merging worlds or some other macguffin causing the realities to merge. My favorite character to play is Green Lantern and I have merged him once with Peter Parker making a new character. Super Flexible here with who the lead male can be and where we take the plot. &amp;#x200B; **Fang:** *A Miraculous Story* \- I watched this show with my niece and thought it be fun to write a story where a more dominant older character stepped in and fought crime with Lady Bug. I already settled with this character being a Wolf, about 30 something years old and dominating the fuck out of the school girls in this setting. Expect a very different kind of Miraculous story if you undertake this with me. &amp;#x200B; **The Gray Jedi:** *The Star Wars Story* \- I don't always play Star Wars stories but when I do I am Gray Jedi Master who fucks his padawans. Really though most Star Wars plots are great but I prefer the Old Republic over any other setting. Multiple padwans are desired in this setting. OC characters are great. Canon women are more then welcome. &amp;#x200B; **The King of the North:** *A* *Game of Thrones* \- I do A LOT of retcons on Game of Thrones and 95% of them are saving a hot female from a untimely death. Moving beyond that I usually explore a plot where Jon Snow becomes a dominant stud and starts to build an empire in the North and in the wombs of any woman he see's fit. The means of corruption usually comes from Ygritte shooting some arrows into him only this time the arrows are poisoned and he gets changed by the experience. Does he get bigger and stronger? Just a massive cock? Maybe he turns into Wolf or Dragon? Who knows! Well I do but I mean what do you want from this story. &amp;#x200B; **Lord of Columbia**: *A Bioshock Story* \- Elizabeth from Bioshock might be one of my top 10 females from video games; Lara Croft, Sarah Kerrigan, and Tali'Zorah also make that list. What makes me want to put her on this list? Reality hopping. I love the idea of her teaming up with her Daddy (Booker) and helping him find other versions of her and making them his. Its perverted, incestous and has themes of ageplay, harems, and breeding but I fucking love it. Even more so if he takes Rapture as well. This is pretty much for pervs who love Bioshock as much as me. &amp;#x200B; **Normandy Harem:** *Mass Effect Story* \- There are three avenues to make Shepard become 'evil'. Cerberus Nanites, Collector Parasites, or Reaper Indoctrination Device. I tend to prefer the first option but the result always leads him to fucking the women of the Normandy. Is this plot not your thing? I have ideas for Andromeda and a clone program that makes a bunch of female Shepards. &amp;#x200B; **Symbiote Chronicles**: *A Spider-man Story* \- I find Peter Parker, bit of a Gary Stu. I actually really enjoyed how human they made him in Enter the Spider-Verse. I am getting off track. Point is, I play a more human Spider-man. He's not smarter then Stark, he cant lift two tanks, and he cant shoot a web faster then hammer of a pistol after the trigger is pulled. I am off track again. Spider-Man. Sexual Deviant. Venom Symbiote. Lots of Sex. Mary Jane. Gwen Stacey. Snoo Snoo. You get the idea. &amp;#x200B; **Tongue of the Dragon:** *A Skyrim Story* \- A shelved story idea I been to fucking lazy to finish. Sexy Dragon Shouts. Is it possible? Actually yeah the vocab is there but I haven't spent the time to put together a list of perverted shouts. Shouts that would rip armor off a female warriors body, make a person instantly more submissive or make them susceptible to mind control. It should be noted &amp;#x200B; **Vault Alpha:** *A Fallout Story* \- I have about 10 Vaults I made for the Fallout setting. Hands down my favorite is Vault Alpha also known as a cultural preservation vault. A girls school with a bunch of students from all over the world (including communist China) and their cultures knowledge saved with them. Of course, there was a boys school with same objective but they didn't survive (or did they?) but with the tunnel joining the vaults collapsed they wont find out anytime soon. Its a fun take on Fallout and one I love to explore. If thats not your thing guess what? I got more fucking fallout plots! &amp;#x200B; **Other Canon** \- Honestly the list of games, books, movies, shows, cartoon, anime, and comics goes on forever. Make a list of your favorites from those listed media mediums and present them in conversation. I will let you know which ones I know and are willing to play. I freely admit my anime/manga selection is limited to mostly what comes across Adult Swim. # Generic Stories **Angels &amp; Demons** \- Summoning an Incubus, Hell on Earth with angels and demons fighting for souls, a taboo coupling of angel and demon, and more. I love a good Heaven and Hell story. &amp;#x200B; **Cyber/Bio/Nanopunk** \- I tend to lean towards criminals, hackers, ex-military types, and noir style detectives. I always loved these setting where humanity has blurred the lines between man and machine and began to twist his DNA to suit his needs. &amp;#x200B; **CYOA** \- There are now lewd CYOA's that exist online. If you have something that gets you nice and wet feel free to share. I have a F-list profile dedicated to my collection. &amp;#x200B; **End of the World/Post Apoc** \- Gritty stories where the world has ended by drought, plague, radiation, virus or even the undead. While I would never wish this on humanity it does bring peoples character to the surface. Are you a Criminal? A Survivor? A reluctant hero? A submissive? The end of the world will let you know. &amp;#x200B; **Fantasy** \- Orcs, Centaurs, Elves, and Demons! Oh my! I personally love Conquest plots where kingdoms fall to invaders who take the spoils. Other stories like a demonic curse or princess in hiding also interest me. &amp;#x200B; **Fairy Tales** \- I love a good folk tale! We can keep it in the fantasy setting or shift it to a modern setting. Alternatively I been exploring polytheistic gods in the same lense as Fairy Tales, so if you want to see stories about Zeus. Let me know. &amp;#x200B; **Furries** \- Oh god he rights furry stories as well? Yeah I fucking do. I am a Big Bad Wolf who ruts foxes and bunnies wanna fight about it? &amp;#x200B; **Free Use World** \- A popular choice on Reddit where people are used freely in society for sexual purposes. I can get behind this sort of plot with the right people and in the right setting. Come with a good reason for society become so sexually open. &amp;#x200B; **Holiday** \- Christmas, Halloween, Easter, Etc. I have a profile dedicated to Holiday stories on F-list. I am willing to indulge in the festivities here. If you wanna get fucked in a Halloween costume? I got you. Want to be wrapped in a big bow for Christmas? Of course. Wanna get dominated by an anthro easter bunny? I'm your man. &amp;#x200B; **Incest** \- I have a lewd soft spot for Brother/Sister and Father/Daughter plots myself. Not against Uncle/Niece or Son/Mother either. If a story has family members as characters, I am more than willing to explore those perverted couplings. &amp;#x200B; **Interracial** \- This is a tough one only because racism is still a real thing and I walk this fine line between playing interracial motivated scenes and some stereotypes. There are real bigots online who solely get off on racist scenes and cant separate a short fantasy from respecting and caring for other people in the real world. If you find yourself believe racist beliefs and taking that as you personal social/political view. I am not the man for you. &amp;#x200B; **Military/Spies** \- Gritty settings mostly set in the middle east these days. I enjoy the occasional boots on the ground story where soldiers let off steam while in a secluded base. I admit I added zombies to these military plots a few times. Spies are little more different, located in the cities and focuses on the spy craft itself. &amp;#x200B; **Modern Fantasy** \- Magical wielders hidden in plain sight in the modern world. This includes Elves hiding their ears, vampires in a modern setting, men locking themselves in shipping containers under a full moon, or immortal gods running their own companies. The possibilities are endless. &amp;#x200B; **Monsters** \- I can play a werewolf, incubus, tentacle fiend, or whatever for your personal cravings. Monsters can be fun if done right and unlike most settings it can be done fantasy, modern or scifi no problem. &amp;#x200B; **Slasher** \- Been kicking around the idea of a sexy slasher setting. Big scary 'killer' hunting teens only instead of murdering them he fucks them senseless. Maybe they are fucked so hard they are knocked out for hours or start to like the slasher with that giant cock. I dont know. &amp;#x200B; **Space Opera** \- Space marines, derelict ship with aliens on-board, colonization missions, or just a ragtag crew taking on odd jobs. I love me a good space story! &amp;#x200B; **Steam/Diesel/Atom/Clockpunk** \- A fun setting that I mostly write with furry characters. The main reason why we love these settings? Personal sky ships, fashion and a sense of adventure. Great backdrop for a lewd story. &amp;#x200B; **Super Heroes** \- We can either use canon heroes or make up our own heroes for some super powered sex scenes. I usually play a Batman Esq hero myself but if you want me to fly and fuck you so hard we take down a building I am down. &amp;#x200B; **Supernatural** \- Be it the occult, witchcraft, demons, ancient books or artifacts or whatever. I have a Templar who's managed to survive hundreds of years as a potential champion for the story of our choosing. If you love the Supernatural we can expand on it together. &amp;#x200B; **Toons** \- We all love cartoons and I am more than willing to explore the hundereds of lovely characters given to us in Cartoons. We can write a story with the Power Puff Girls or we can have a plot where we live in a cartoon reality (Like Cool World) where physics are suggestions and the only way to kill a toon is with a eraser. &amp;#x200B; **Westerns** \- I found Westerns are pretty hard plots to get off the ground. When I have written plots like this its mostly bounty hunting or building a homestead with a strong female and her son. I only have a few working ideas for this setting so meet me half way on the brainstorming. &amp;#x200B; **Witches &amp; Warlocks** \- After watching that new Sabrina, witchcraft has been on my mind. If you want to explore a setting that explores Witchcraft be in our modern world or Hogwarts I am down. &amp;#x200B; **Other Settings** \- I probably missed some things like Tron, Gor, Robots, and historical periods. If you have something you like feel free to suggest it. Worse case scenario is me saying ""No Thanks"" and suggesting something else. Be creative and feel free to mix and match ideas like Cyberpunk and Zombies, sounds fucking awesome to me. # Top Kinks * **Ageplay** \- Loli's and Jailbait to Milfs and Dilfs. I like ageplay in my stories (depending on the plot) and so should you. It's not mandatory but if want to up your chances to play with me you need to be ok with this kink. * **Breeding/Pregnancy** \- Not sure when I developed this kink but I love the idea of knocking up my companions. Its the connection that it creates putting a baby in a fertile womb. I am down to explore this kink all the way up to birth, such scenes involving that should happen off screen. * **Corruption** \- Just like Transformation but changing of the mind. I like moving the dial of characters morality and personality in a story. My favorite is a Lawful Good male becoming a Deviant Dominating Pervert. He doesnt need to be evil, he just needs to value sex over people. * **Domination** \- I like to be in control in most stories. Master/Slave, Daddy/Daughter, Alpha/Omega and so on. I dont mind stories that involve scenes where I am submissive but there is no chance I will do a plot where I remain that way. Where I dont turn the tables and take control of the woman who thought she was the mistress. * **Harem Play** \- Needless to say I am kind of greedy. I like plots where I claim multiple girls. If you think thats unfair, let me remind you I GM/DM 99% of my stories so the work load is more often then not on my shoulders. If you're willing to play a harem for me, you get to move to the front of the line. * **Incest** \- A family that plays together. Stays together. Incest is not a must but I love to have it appear in most plots. Improve your chances of playing by agreeing to exploring this kink. * **Interracial** \- I love a good mix of skin colors in the bedroom. I love the cultural differences and exploring how people fit. However, if you I think you are a real racist; MAGA hat wearing Neo Nazi Trump voter. You can go fuck yourself. * **Mind Control** \- Closely related to corruption. I love playing with mind control. It can be easy like swinging a gem in front of your face until your under a trance or it can be hard like me slowly reprogramming your mind by altering memories. I enjoy both fantastical snap your fingers mind control and the realistic subliminal music/image approach that takes effect over time. * **Transformation** \- There is something about getting bigger, thicker, stronger, or turning from man to beast that turns me on. I like it when it happens to me. I like it when it happens to you. Most my stories have TF to varying degrees. # Closing So there you have it my long winded post to catch quality female players like you. Reddit isn't a great space to hunt for female players if only because there are 10 to 1 male to female ratio and lesser males love to downvote other \[M4F\] posts above/below their own. If you have read this full post; Good Job, Gold Star! Shoot me a Message (Reddit chat is hot garbage), if we click well we will move this party to Discord where hopefully we will play for a very very long time. &amp;#x200B; Lewd Regards, **Master of Perversion** ^(P.S.

25,cyber crime,AgeplayPenPals,M4F Agents of T.W.E.R.K,1,9fbthu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/9fbthu/m4f_agents_of_twerk/,2018-09-13 07:16:36,"**I am an adult looking for another adult to do a silly fantasy roleplay with!** Also this is a pretty dumb RP scenario, I know. Some spies use their cunning wit or impeccable dexterity to handle dangerous missions, but not all secret agents are gifted in those ways. Some are born with different... er assets, and use those big bouncing assets to their advantage when in the field. These agents are the the members of a highly trained secret organization known as ...T.W.E.R.K. T.W.E.R.K. usually handle more delicate situations happening on domestic soil, like ""interrogating"" teen hackers and ""protecting"" valuable witnesses. The organization has faced some criticism by fellow secret divisions of the Gov't for their...unorthodox methods. Missions Available for T.W.E.R.K Agents vary from the totally **mundane and pointless** to the completely **absurd**. #### T.W.E.R.K. vs C.U.K ----------------------------- The unfortunately named C.U.K., is a group of 14-18 yr old virgin cyber trolls who may seem innocent at first, but they probably(maybe) have done some serious hacking of important people's files on the cloud. While they have not committed any hard crimes, that we can prove, they are pretty annoying on twitter and those of us at T.W.E.R.K. feel they need to be taken care of. It's up to you how this situation is handled though; blueballing, man-making, handjobs etc etc ---------------------------------- #### Deadly Serums ----------------------------- This is embarrassing, two teen friends were hanging out at the older boy's house when they snuck into his private office. Without knowing it though, they drank two bottles of experimental fluids that they thought were booze. Luckily, when they broke into the man-cave/lab, it triggered an a silent alarm that alerted us. Unlucky(?) for the boys though, the fluids they drank won't be easy to get out of their systems. Firstly they need to get their balls full of cum ready to explode out...well we can explain it as you help them out. ---------------------------------- #### Working for the Fraud Office ---------------------------------- Gotta keep the lights on at T.W.E.R.K., so occasionally the agency will contract out their agents to other businesses. This happens to be a simple fraud case, some horny boys stealing a card for strippers. But regardless, it's a serious crime and they should be brought to justice...something. [Scene: an older couple is out at dinner awaiting their appetizers as the woman's phone begins to ring out with notifications.] ""Oh geez...I got an alert on my phone that someone was using my credit card again. Think it's Steve and College buddies?"" Martha says as she swipes through the notification on the anti-fraud app. ""Don't worry honey, I'll call the Special Fraud Inspection Service"" the man across the dinner table huffs out as he grabs his phone and begins dialing and putting the device to his ear. ""Yes..could you please check into it, thanks."" [Back at the house, Steve and Russell your typical 17-18 yr old Highschool jocks are staring intently at the computer.] ""Yo, man make sure this ho has a big white girl booty."" Russel, a 6'1'' athletic black teen says with an excited voice. ""This is going to be awesome.."" Steve hovers the purchase button, guaranteeing ""service"" in 30 minutes or less. He hesitates for a moment, thinking about how he just frauded his mom out of $3k but he clicks the button regardless ""And buy"". Sadly for boys they accidentally put the wrong address AND don't know about this ""stripper"" is really a T.W.E.R.K. agents hired by the fraud office to check out this purchase.

Some are born with different... er assets, and use those big bouncing assets to their advantage when in the field. These agents are the the members of a highly trained secret organization known as ...T.W.E.R.K. T.W.E.R.K. usually handle more delicate situations happening on domestic soil, like ""interrogating"" teen hackers and ""protecting"" valuable witnesses. The organization has faced some criticism by fellow secret divisions of the Gov't for their...unorthodox methods. Missions Available for T.W.E.R.K Agents vary from the totally **mundane and pointless** to the completely **absurd**. #### T.W.E.R.K. vs C.U.K ----------------------------- The unfortunately named C.U.K., is a group of 14-18 yr old virgin cyber trolls who may seem innocent at first, but they probably(maybe) have done some serious hacking of important people's files on the cloud. While they have not committed any hard crimes, that we can prove, they are pretty annoying on twitter and those of us at T.W.E.R.K. feel they need to be taken care of. It's up to you how this situation is handled though; blueballing, man-making, handjobs etc etc ---------------------------------- #### Deadly Serums ----------------------------- This is embarrassing, two teen friends were hanging out at the older boy's house when they snuck into his dad's private office. Without knowing it though, they drank two bottles of experimental fluids that they thought were booze. Luckily, when they broke into the man-cave/lab, it triggered an a silent alarm that alerted us. Unlucky(?) for the boys though, the fluids they drank won't be easy to get out of their systems. Firstly they need to get their balls full of cum ready to explode out...well we can explain it as you help them out. ---------------------------------- #### Birthday Operation ---------------------------------- Intel has it that Agent Phil Smithers' teen son could be the target of a kidnapping at his 15th birthday party, so you've been tasked to make sure everything goes smoothly. Agent Smithers didn't really elaborate on any of the details, and might have made this whole thing up so he can stare at your chest for 3 hours. But regardless, you need to stay very 'close' to the boy, Agent. ---------------------------------- #### Working for the Fraud Office ---------------------------------- Gotta keep the lights on at T.W.E.R.K., so occasionally the agency will contract out their agents to other businesses. This happens to be a simple fraud case, some horny boys stealing a card for strippers. But regardless, it's a serious crime and they should be brought to justice...something. [Scene: an older couple is out at dinner awaiting their appetizers as the woman's phone begins to ring out with notifications.] ""Oh geez...I got an alert on my phone that someone was using my credit card again. Think it's Steve and College buddies?"" Martha says as she swipes through the notification on the anti-fraud app. ""Don't worry honey, I'll call the Special Fraud Inspection Service"" the man across the dinner table huffs out as he grabs his phone and begins dialing and putting the device to his ear. ""Yes..could you please check into it, thanks."" [Back at the house, Steve and Russell your typical 17-18 yr old Highschool jocks are staring intently at the computer.] ""Yo, man make sure this ho has a big white girl booty."" Russel, a 6'1'' athletic black teen says with an excited voice. ""This is going to be awesome.."" Steve hovers the purchase button, guaranteeing ""service"" in 30 minutes or less. He hesitates for a moment, thinking about how he just frauded his mom out of $3k but he clicks the button regardless ""And buy"". Sadly for boys they accidentally put the wrong address AND don't know about this ""stripper"" is really a T.W.E.R.K. agents hired by the fraud office to check out this purchase.
