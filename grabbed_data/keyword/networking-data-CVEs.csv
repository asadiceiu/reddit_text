We have to document CVEs that may affect our devices and I got tired one afternoon of doing it manually so I threw this script together. &amp;#x200B; It's far from perfect, but it works pretty well for us and saves us hours doing it manually until we can get the software that will do this for us. Right now it is only setup for F5 LTM, Palo Alto, NXOS and ASA vulnerabilities. Hope it helps! &amp;#x200B; [URL &amp;#x200B;"

I'm Derek from the Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, and we have completed an audit of OpenVPN 2.4.0 with QuarksLab. You can view the synopsis of the results here, and the full report is also linked within: URL The audit resulted in two CVEs URL URL As well as a number of minor issues and fixes. I will be checking this post and answering any questions you might have about the organization, our goals, or this audit for the rest of the day today. After that I will still periodically check this post for updated questions or comments. Thank you to the 33 companies and hundreds of people that supported this effort. This happened because the community made it happen. Our next target is OpenSSL 1.1.1 which is the first version to implement TLS 1.3. The update contains a lot of code changes that give us an opportunity to review and improve the code to make it safer. The biggest way that you can contribute to us is by word of mouth. The more people hear about the positive work that we do, the more likely we are going to get donations, business contacts, and the logistical support that we need to operate and grow. We have many ways to contribute to our cause, some of them being completely cost-free. Check out our donations page to see how to help!"
2,CVEs,networking,Quanta T3048-LY8 review (and questions),2,4uzce4,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/4uzce4/quanta_t3048ly8_review_and_questions/,2016-07-28 16:41:03,"Recently, I've been digging into this hardware a bit. As a bit of context, I started by career working at an ISP and am honestly 10+ years out of the networking game. I'm a sysadmin and Linux developer by trade (I have worked for multiple Linux distros as a packager) and am regularly tapped as ""the network guy."" In other words, I'm no expert but I've (literally) forgotten more than most sysadmins know in the first place. Imagine my elation with the entrance of the era of white box switches and merchant silicon. To step into this we recently got the Quanta [T3048-LY8](URL device. At first glance it was a gem. You can easily drop to a bash shell and start inspecting the host... this is where things became increasingly disappointing. As everything is based on something else... let's see where they started from: # cat /etc/system-release Fedora release 14 (Laughlin) woof....that can't be right.... # /lib/libc.so.6 GNU C Library stable release version 2.12.2, by Roland McGrath et al. Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc. This is free software; see the source for copying conditions. There is NO warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Compiled by GNU CC version 4.4.5 20101112 (Red Hat 4.4.5-2). Compiled on a Linux 2.6.34 system on 2010-12-13. Available extensions: The C stubs add-on version 2.1.2. crypt add-on version 2.1 by Michael Glad and others GNU Libidn by Simon Josefsson Native POSIX Threads Library by Ulrich Drepper et al BIND-8.2.3-T5B RT using linux kernel aio libc ABIs: UNIQUE IFUNC For bug reporting instructions, please see: &lt;URL Hmm... glibc compiled in 2010.... looks like this is correct (and full of CVEs). The ssh server is based on god knows what. It serves DSA host keys by default and when you actually dig in under the hood it's provided by some monolithic process: # netstat -ntlp Active Internet connections (only servers) Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address Foreign Address State PID/Program name tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:2222 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 210/switchdrvr tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:2002 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 210/switchdrvr tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:2324 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 2453/utelnetd tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:22 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 210/switchdrvr tcp 0 0 :::22 ::%147477792:* LISTEN 210/switchdrvr tcp 0 0 :::23 ::%147477792:* LISTEN 210/switchdrvr Ok... at this point I've become a bit nonplussed, but whatever! Who cares as long as I can get things done.... and besides... IT""S A WHITE BOX!!!! But then... sadness. First I install OpenNetworkLinux. Install is super simple. I turn the whole thing around with a new install in under 20 minutes. This is where I come to the darker side of merchant silicon. Every driver for the actual forwarding chipset is encumbered. Ok, Ok, sure... in the most technical sense the *driver* is open source... but that's really bullshit. The Trident II chipset driver is really just a shim which then pivots to an opaque binary blob. Don't sign the NDA to get the sources? Too bad. Don't get ahold of the Broadcom SDK to compile it? Too bad. So now I've got a switch with no forwarding engine that can't see it's 48 SFP+ ports... this isn't really useful. Time to get things back online. I go to the T3048-LY8 download page and grab the firmware. Go to re-install it with ONIE... and this is where it gets even more mind bending. It won't install. That's correct: **the firmware downloaded directly from Quanta won't install** At this point, I'm livid. I contact Quanta. They send me the link to the same file... twice. I keep explaining that it doesn't work. After repeatedly jumping through hoops they tell me: ""Oh... that's the x86 based switch. We don't develop firmware for that any more. You have to use an older version [which is no longer published anywhere]."" More jumping through hoops, I get the old version and get it installed. Apparently no one is really intended to run this switch with the base OS. It's just a channel solution for Cumulus Linux. I dig further and confirm that this isn't even a supported switching platform by other network OS vendors. Really... my only option is figure out ""QuantaOS"" or take more drastic measures. I decide to start simple and go back to the drawing board. It looks like a pseudo cisco interface, so I should be able to (roughly) stumble through years of IOS and CatOS commands... wrong. This was the point I really started getting confused: (qsw1) #configure (qsw1) (Config)#interface 0/49 (qsw1) (Interface 0/49)#switchport mode ? access Enable/Disable vlan access mode (qsw1) (Interface 0/49)#switchport ? acceptable-frame-types Configure how to handle tagged/untagged frames received. access Set the access vlan for a specific port. allowed Configure an interface associate with VLAN. dot1q-tunnel Configure dot1q tunneling for a specific (uplink) port. dvlan-tunnel Configure double VLAN tunneling for a specific (uplink) port. forbidden Configures forbidden VLANs for an interface ingress-filtering Enable/Disable application of Ingress Filtering Rules. mode Enable/Disable vlan access mode. native Configure the VLAN ID for a specific port. priority Configure the priority for untagged frames. protected Configure Switchport to Protected mode. protocol Configure the Protocol Based VLAN parameters. tagging Configure tagging for a specific VLAN port. (qsw1) (Interface 0/49)#switchport dot1q-tunnel ? &lt;cr&gt; Press enter to execute the command. ethertype Configure the EtherType for the interface. (qsw1) (Interface 0/49)#switchport dot1q-tunnel ethertype ? 802.1Q Configure the etherType as 0x8100. custom Custom configure the EtherType for the DVLAN tunnel. vman Configure the EtherType as 0x88A8. (qsw1) (Interface 0/49)#switchport dot1q-tunnel ethertype 802.1Q ? &lt;cr&gt; Press enter to execute the command. Ok, that can't be right. I didn't really just try to do something like configure a trunk port for a VLAN on a QSFP port and have this device say ""no way dewd"". So... two things. * I'll keep everyone abreast of the saga of Quanta * Is there anyone who's chosen to fight through the default network OS who can point me to a configuration guide *better* than the CLI reference (which is pretty bunk) or the installation guide (which is literally just ""how to rack the device and swap FRUs"".)"
3,CVEs,networking,How do you track the monthly Cisco vulnerabilities notification,13,4a30g4,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/4a30g4/how_do_you_track_the_monthly_cisco/,2016-03-12 18:36:10,"I'm curious to see how others are tracking the list of affected devices from the Cisco Security Alerts notification. Currently, we dump all the data in a spreadsheet with each one on its own sheet. But it's a tedious process. We tried using Solarwinds NCM but it uses a strict definition where it only gathers CVEs that affect Cisco devices only. Is there a more efficient way of doing this?"
