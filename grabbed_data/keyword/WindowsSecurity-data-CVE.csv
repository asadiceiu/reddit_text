0,CVE,WindowsSecurity,List of Windows Server Security Updates by CVE?,1,i7qsag,https://www.reddit.com/r/WindowsSecurity/comments/i7qsag/list_of_windows_server_security_updates_by_cve/,2020-08-11 22:19:59," Hello, So I am looking for a list of all prior Windows Server 2008 Security Updates (preferable by CVE) to match it against a list of all CVEs. Goal is to see which security vulnerabilities still persist in Windows Server 2008 if no extended support package is bought. Apparently, there doesnt seem to be a way to file a request to MSRC directly and the usual MS support had no idea how to handle this request even upon the third try. There is however a good table published by MSRC under the url: URL But apparently this website features Sever 2016, Server 2012, Windows 10, etc. down to even Server 2004. Sadly no sign of 2008. Is it possible to get a list for Server 2008 somewhere? I desperately need to figure out which known vulnerabilities persist in Windows Server 2008 without extended support for risk analysis. Any help highly appreciated! Best Regards"
1,CVE,WindowsSecurity,Offline Patch &amp; Vulnerability detection tool?,1,gqw1ko,https://www.reddit.com/r/WindowsSecurity/comments/gqw1ko/offline_patch_vulnerability_detection_tool/,2020-05-26 22:24:56,"Hello, To no avail I have been trying to find a tool that would be able to scan a Windows 10 system that is not connected to the internet and identify vulnerabilities of system and software. For patch management purposes. The CVE definitions would need to be transferred to the software ad-hoc prior to the scan. I have had no success looking for such tool... Do you perhaps know of anything like this? Thank you"
