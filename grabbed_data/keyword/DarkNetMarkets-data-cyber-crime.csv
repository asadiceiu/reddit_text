The photograph reveals some interesting things, one of which is the revelation that the National Security Agency (NSA) is conducting a joint project with the US Armys Cyber Protection Team (CPT) from the Cyber Protection Brigade located in Fort Gordon, Georgia. The image, originally posted on 4chans /biz section which is their Business and Finance forum, is dated August 21st, 2017 and states: MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD SUBJECT: Additional resource request for ACC project 2nd Battalions joint NSA/CPT [Cyber Protection Team] anonymous cryptocurrency project needs additional support in the form of new hires and additional funding to meet GWOT [Global War On Terror] and drug interdiction objectives outlined in Julys Command update brief.  Requesting authorization to add additional civilian consultants to the ACC project and to initiate their SCI investigations  Requesting additional funds for class 7 and 9, amounts indicated in attached cost analysis worksheet. The success we have had with Tor, I2P, and VPN cannot be replicated with those currencies that do not rely on nodes [?]. There is a growing trend in the employment of Stealth address and ring signatures that will require additional R&amp;D. Please reference the weekly SITREP [SITuation REPort] ON SIPR for more details regarding the TTPs involved. BLUF [Bottom Line, Up Front]: In order to put the CPT back on track, we need to identify and employ additional personnel who are familiar with the CryptoNote code available for use in anonymous currencies. Include this request for discussion at the next training meeting. Point of contact for this memorandum is CW4 Henry, James P. at DSN (312)-780-2222. JAMES,HENRY .P1363921716 The document mentions anonymous cryptocurrencies that are based on the CryptoNote protocol and the use of stealth addresses and ring signatures, which is a reference to anonymous cryptocurrencies like Monero (XMR), Anonymous Electronic Online CoiN (AEON), DarkNet Coin (DNC), Fantomcoin (FCN), and Bytecoin (BCN). Bytecoin was the first widely used cryptocurrency to use the CryptoNote protocol. These kinds of cryptocurrencies have been monitored by the federal government for a while now and in the past officials from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have expressed that they had an expectation that Monero would become more widely used on the darknet. This alleged document is authored by CW4 James P. Henry, who is also the point of contact for the cryptocurrency project mentioned in the document. CW4 stands for Chief Warrant Officer of the 4th rank, an appointed technical specialist position. Some of the other abbreviations used in the document are unclear, some may refer to the US Army Signal Corp. There is a Defense Switched Network (DSN) phone number listed for James P. Henry. When this DSN phone number was converted into a phone number that can be reached from the regular commercial phone network and called, the number was in fact the US Armys Cyber Protection Brigade located in Fort Gordon, Georgia, just as the document purported to originate from. While it is possible someone could have done a search for the Cyber Protection Brigade telephone number and used the conversion chart to recreate the DSN version of the phone number, it should be noted that the DSN phone number was not published on the internet prior to the release of this leak. The Armys Cyber Protection Brigade (CPB) was activated in September 2014. The CPB is the first of its kind in the Army. Its Cyber Protection Teams, often referred to as CPTs, are part of a larger Cyber Mission Force, manned by active duty military and civilians. The Army National Guard and Army Reserve are also building CPTs to support the Army and Joint Force. All CPTs are trained to a common joint standard to perform primarily defensive cyberspace operations. The CPB comprised of its headquarters and 20 CPTs of approximately 39 civilian and military, an Army website explains. When asked, a Monero developer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that most of the Monero developers who have seen the leak believe it to be authentic. Several sources who were formerly in the Army have also said they believe the document to be real. The contents of the document are completely plausible. An anonymous source who is currently serving in the US Army said from what they understood, that the information contained in the document was accurate. As weve previously reported, the United States federal government is eager to monitor and track cryptocurrency transactions. While federal law enforcement agencies and tax agencies such as the FBI, the DEA, the IRS, ICE, DHS, and others have mostly relied on private contractors like Chainalysis, the NSA and the military does not appear to have paid for blockchain analysis products or services from private contractors like Chainalysis. It is not surprising that the United States intelligence community and military is instead likely using its own resources to conduct surveillance on blockchains. So why would someone leak an Army document announcing a project to track anonymous cryptocurrencies and in passing mentions how it has had some successes with breaking online anonymization services? It is possible this was intentionally leaked to reach a certain group of people. It may have been released, at least in part, to create Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. What is important to remember is that it isnt likely that Tor, I2P, and VPNs are all completely compromised, and it is an important reminder that more people and organizations without malicious intent should run Tor nodes, if they are able to do so securely. It should be noted that sticking out above the laptops monitor, in the bottom right of the photograph, a Common Access Card (CAC) can be seen which displays someones face. A CAC is a type of smart ID card used by the Department of Defense. This was either intentionally included in the photograph, or the leaker has terrible opsec. It is hard to say which is the case, but simple mistakes like this are often made by people who should know better. Just look at the poor opsec of NSA leaker Reality Winner. This document suggests that the Invisible Internet Project (I2P) definitely has the attention of the intelligence community and the military, and that they have had some degree of success in defeating the anonymization service by running malicious nodes. It is possible Moneros Kovri project may be among the reasons the Army and the NSA are interested in compromising I2P. Kovri is an overlay-network for Monero which uses garlic encryption and garlic routing to send Monero transactions over the I2P network, thereby helping conceal the geographic location and actual IP address of Kovri users. The document also suggests that the NSA and the Army havent really had any success surveilling CryptoNote based coins. According to NSA documents that were leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden, it is publicly known that the NSA has compromised some VPN technology, while other VPN technology has caused problems for snoops at the NSA. VPN protocols such as PPTP have been known to have security flaws, and documents released by Snowden show that the IPSEC has been compromised to a degree thank to NSA programs such as Hammerstein and Turbine. One document released by Snowden shows the NSA is able to successfully decrypt IPSEC, PPTP, SSL, and SSH. However, VPNs which use OpenVPN may not be compromised. While some people may think that the NSA and the Army are only interested in compromising anonymity services and anonymous cryptocurrencies to fight the war on terrorism it is important to consider that these intelligence and military resources are in some ways being used for law enforcement purposes. The document itself mentions drug interdiction, and while many people may think of drug kingpins living in foreign countries like El Chapo and Pablo Escobar, compromising things like Tor in combination with things like blockchain surveillance could be, and likely have been, used against American citizens like Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the Silk Road darknet market. If the military or the NSA collects information that someone within the United States is committing a crime through a warrantless search of their electronic communications, that is something many privacy rights activists argue is a violation of the 4th amendment. In general, the military is supposed to be forbidden from conducting domestic law enforcement operations under the Posse Comitatus Act, as well as under Department of Defense regulation. However, the military is allowed to assist law enforcement agencies in certain ways, but that doesnt mean they are allowed to sidestep the 4th amendment. The NSA has been authorized to share raw intelligence intercepts with domestic law enforcement agencies, and this information has been secretly used to prosecute people in America. The source of information is often covered up by law enforcement through a process known as parallel construction. It is clear the federal government is interested in mass surveillance of the private financial transactions of Americans and everyone else in the world. Many sources were consulted to try and confirm the authenticity of this document, and in a future article we will cover the results of attempts to uncover more information regarding this document and the project it refers to. One source consulted for this article suggested that the photograph did not appear to be digitally manipulated. Like WikiLeaks, we present this document and hope others are able to confirm the authenticity of it and make use of the information. A Freedom Of Information Act request will be made to try and obtain more information. "

Operation Dragon focused on human trafficking, illegal immigration, cocaine trafficking, heroin trafficking, synthetic drug trafficking, cybercrime, weapon trafficking, counterfeit trafficking, MITC fraud, and variations of organized crime. Europol and Frontex coordinated the placement of thousands of law enforcement officers at hundreds of locations during 2017. The series of targeted actions took place between June 5 and October 20. The aim of the operation, Europol wrote in their press release (Scribd link), was to disrupt crime in the sectors mentioned above. Europol provided a summary of the actions taken during the operation. Below are some of the actions in a summarized form. Global Airport Action Day Sixty-six countries, 84 airlines, 230 airports, and Europol, Eurojust, AMERIPOL, CLACIP, INTERPOL, Frontex, NCFTA, and UNODC launched a global action against online ticket fraud. Europol wrote that fraudulent ticket purchases often have ties to more serious crimes. The joint action launched on June 5 and ran through June 9. The participants repeated the action on October 16 through October 20. This part of the operation resulted in the arrest of 153 suspects. Cyber-Patrolling Week Between June 12 and June 16, 2017, 25 countries completed the first ever coordinated action week to counter the evolving criminality on the Darknet. The action focused on assorted cybercrime and darknet drug trafficking. More than 40 specialists listed 272 actors for identification. Law enforcement agencies selected 73 to investigate at a greater length. Europol reportedly discovered that 42 actors cross-matched across the targeted crime sectors. Large-Scale Joint Action Day (LS-JAD) All 28 European Union member states, five outside countries, CCWP, INTERPOL, MAOC-N, and Europol focused on human trafficking, cocaine trafficking, and OPC between October 9 and October 13. Law enforcement arrested 692 people and opened almost 400 new drug trafficking investigations. The authorities seized 267 kilograms of cocaine, 19 kilograms of amphetamine, almost two kilograms of MDMA, and 327 ecstasy tablets. Joint Action Day Calibre Europol, Frontex, and 18 countries helped Europol seize 136 firearms between November 17 and 18. Europol provided analytical on-the-spot support. In addition to the weapons, the action resulted in the seizure of 7,000 rounds of ammo. Only 18 individuals landed in custody as a result of the action against illegal firearm trafficking. Operation Dragon was not Europols only operation during 2017. In July, they caught 76 suspected fraudsters as a result of eCommerce Action 2017. And in May, Europol warned the public that the Dark Web Is The Heaven For Organized Criminals In The EU. URL"

Video of some tard looking at this site, ddw, dream, and others.",0,7eug1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/7eug1a/what_you_need_to_know_about_the_darknet_according/,2017-11-23 08:29:29,"URL ST. LOUIS, MO - Its called the Darknet, a network built on top of the existing internet and used by people to acquire illegal items, including your personal information. Many kids are accessing it without their parents knowing. Vinny Troia of Night Lion Security, a professional, ethical hacking group, explains that the Darknet is a group of websites, marketplaces if you will, that live on a different part of the internet.In a matter of moments, he showed FOX 2s Vic Faust that most of his personal information was for sale on a Darknet site. Troia says, You can buy drugs, stolen goods, counterfeit merchandise. Theres even a huge area for child trafficking, also underage porn. Its designed to be a hidden internet, used mostly by criminals who want to stay anonymous. Larry McClain of Speartip, a cyber counterintelligence company in St. Louis, spent 20 years in law enforcement, including working for the FBI and Secret Service task force. He says investigating Darknet activity is not impossible, but there are challenges. Doing an investigation, it can be resolved to the Philippines or Washington state. Those detectives may not be being paid to investigate crimes all over the world, when you need to take care of your own backyard. While browsing, FOX 2 saw bulks of credit cards on sale for next to nothing. Troia adds, On top of that you can purchase full identities of people for $5-$10 a pop. Bitcoin is how money is exchanged on the sites. No credit cards. That adds to the anonymous nature of the service and, yes, kids are using it. I would always recommend having a filter so you know whats going on, says Troia. Number one, a filter on to block them but also a traffic monitor to actually see what theyre doing. Experts are also concerned with how Darknet sales may be funding terrorism. If youre going out and, making a purchase, youre buying whatever, its something to consider where that money is going. Either youre fueling some crime syndicate or youre fueling terrorists, explains Troia."
4,cyber-crime,DarkNetMarkets,Has anyone heard about this ? CT is starting a dark web drug &amp; fraud investigation unit.,18,79ysg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/79ysg8/has_anyone_heard_about_this_ct_is_starting_a_dark/,2017-11-01 07:54:52,"URL ... Seems like it's mostly fent related. Not a big surprise because CT has had some huge fentanyl busts and has a big opiate problem. So as of now there are 2 police units in the US dedicated to just Darknet drugs one is the CCDNSTF ( central California darknet strike task force ) and now the one in CT. Thoughts ? Advancing technology has broadened opportunities in many areas  including crime. Recognizing that, 11 police departments, Bridgeport among them, have joined with federal and state agencies to form the Connecticut Cyber Task Force.The operation was announced Tuesday, and is headquartered at the Federal Bureau of Investigation office in New Haven. The primary goal of the task force is to combine available federal, state and local law enforcement resources in Connecticut to address challenging and emerging cyber threats, said FBI Special Agent in Charge Patricia M. Ferrick. The Bristol, Fairfield, Greenwich, Hartford, New Canaan, New London, Norwalk, Stamford Torrington and Westport police departments have representatives in the task force as well. The task force also includes representatives from the FBI, U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Internal Revenue Service, Drug Enforcement Administration, Homeland Security Investigations, Defense Criminal Investigative Service and Connecticut State Police. The broad reach of cyber criminals can be felt almost every day in Connecticut, said U.S. Attorney Deirdre M. Daly. Day after day, we learn of companies, municipalities, educational institutions, hospitals, public utilities, non-profits and citizens being targeted. While traditional drug dealers and users can be caught red-handed with actual drugs, black-market website operators profit without those risks, and they take advantage of anonymity and existing delivery services like the U.S. Postal Service. Many times these organizations are utilizing the dark web to procure fentanyl directly from China, said DEA Special Agent in Charge Michael J. Ferguson. Connecticut has been experiencing a deadly opioid epidemic, and the majority of these deaths can be attributed to a combination of fentanyl and heroin. DEA Assistant Special Agent in Charge Brian D. Boyle said dealers are reaping the benefits of buying boxes of drugs online, paying lower prices and reducing their risk inside the dangerous drug underworld. You dont have to stand on a corner in the Bronx or Bridgeport, Boyle said. Its safe. Bridgeport Police Capt. Roderick Porter said the department has assigned one detective to work with the new task force while continuing to fulfill duties within the city department. "

Will this even pass or create more FUD? How effective will it be? ""With a flourish of President Donald Trump's pen Thursday, state and local law enforcement got the tools and training needed to fight cybercrime as the Strengthening State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act of 2017 became law. Introduced by Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, the legislation authorizes the highly regarded National Computer Forensics Institute (NCFI) in Hoover, Ala., which has trained nearly 7,000 local officials from 50 states and three U.S. territories. Shortly after Ratcliffe introduced his bill in March, Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, introduced a similar bill in the Senate to expand the NCFI its charter to include training local law enforcement in cybersecurity practices. I'd like to thank President Trump for his strong support of my bill to ensure our state and local law enforcement officials are properly equipped to address and prosecute crimes in the 21st century  because we're now in an era where almost every case involves some sort of digital evidence, Ratcliffe said in a statement. At the end of the day, getting the upper hand against cyber criminals will make our nation safer, and I'm glad that this critical piece of legislation has been signed into law to do just that."""

In theory, if a Law Enforcement agency is behind the attacks (highly likely) and a hosting provider were to report any outages to their servers (this would depend on the host), due to high traffic, potential DDOS attack... then wouldn't this then allow them to find markets? Of course they'd need to be US based which is unlikely and I don't know the technicalities with incoming Tor traffic in terms of what the host would be able to actually identify, but could anything even similar to this be a potential tactic they are pursuing? Or am I just grasping at straws here? edit: wow I'm not very active anymore, but happened to login on my cake day URL Article text below &gt; In an October public service announcement, the FBI explained DDoS-for-hire services and requested that victims of DDoS attacks file a complaint with the FBIs Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). They explained that malicious actors sell DDoS-for-hire services (aka booters) on criminal marketplaces with effectively one goal: preventing access to a U.S. company or government website. &gt; In an earlier press release, the FBI warned that hackers could hijack Internet of Things (IoT) devices and use them for launching attacks against third parties. The FBI used the Mirai botnet as an example of the damage caused by IoT takeovers. While the IoT announcement covered other botnet related activities, it focused mainly on DDoS attacks. And also to give a shout-out to the Mirai botnet for launching DDoS attacks from unsecured IoT devices (or just IoT devices in general  their security is truly abhorrent). &gt; The FBIs DDoS warning also listed the Mirai botnet as the source of one of the largest DDoS attacks in history. Namely the 1Tbps attack against DynDNS that rendered sites like Twitter, PayPal, and Spotify inaccessible to the public. One of the most capable operators of the Mirai botnet used the name BestBuy, among others. Some know him for hacking Deutsche Telekom. Germany and the UK are currently playing a game of pass the suspect with each other, charging BestBuy with various cyber crimes he had allegedly committed. &gt; In addition to warning the public if DDoS attacks in general, the FBI also explained the threat behind booters or stressers. (The threat is effectively the same.) Thanks to the availability of these DDoS-for-hire services on the darknet, the FBI wrote, criminals find them far more convenient than creating their own botnet. &gt; IC3s press release contained a warning that creating a botnet or using their own infrastructure for the purpose of attacking a service or network may result in criminal charges. They added that the same stands for the use of booters or stressers established by someone else. Both are punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and could result in prison time &gt; The FBI requests DDoS victims contact their local FBI field office and/or file a complaint with the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), regardless of dollar loss or timing of incident. The FBI also wanted as much information about the attack that a target or victim could offer. Including, but not limited to, IP addresses associated with the attack, traffic protocol used, and damages caused downtime. &gt; Illegal darknet marketplace operators are unlikely to receive compensation for downtime caused by the DDoS attacks that brought down effectively every relevant market."

WE WILL HAVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND OTHERS OUT IN A FEW MOMENTS. MR. SESSION: GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. I'M ESPECIALLY WANT TO WELCOME YOU -- U.S. ATTORNEY PHIL TALBERT FROM THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. HE HAS DONE GREAT WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT CASE. ANOTHER SPECIAL WELCOME TO YOUR POLL DIRECTOR ROBERT WAINWRIGHT WHO TRAVELED HERE FROM THE NETHERLANDS TO BE WITH US TODAY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS IMPORTANT CASE OF WHICH VARIOUS COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD HAVE PARTICIPATED. ROB, WE APPRECIATE YOU, WE HAVE TREMENDOUS RELATIONSHIPS WITH EUROPOL, WE WORK WITH THEM ON A DAILY BASIS, AND THIS IS THE KIND OF ACTIVITY AND INVESTIGATIVE WORK WE MUST DO IN THIS DAY AND AGE BECAUSE CRIME KNOWS NO QUARTERS. AMONG OTHER CHALLENGES, OUR GREAT COUNTRY IS CURRENTLY IN THE MIDST OF THE DEADLIEST DRUG EPIDEMIC IN OUR HISTORY. ONE AMERICAN NOW DIES OF A DRUG OVERDOSE EVERY 11 MINUTES. MORE THAN 2 MILLION AMERICANS ARE ADDICTED TO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. TODAY, SOME OF THE MOST PROLIFIC DRUG SUPPLIERS USE WHAT IS CALLED THE DARK WEB, WHICH IS A COLLECTION OF HIDDEN WEBSITES THAT YOU CAN ONLY ACCESS IF YOU MASK YOUR IDENTITY AND YOUR LOCATION. IT IS CALLED DARK, NOT JUST BECAUSE THESE SITES ARE INTENTIONALLY HIDDEN. IT IS ALSO DARK BECAUSE WHAT IS SOLD ON MANY OF THEM, ILLEGAL WEAPONS, STOLEN IDENTITIES, CHILD PORNOGRAPHY, AND LARGE AMOUNTS OF NARCOTICS. TODAY, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ANNOUNCED THE TAKEDOWN OF A DARK WEB MARKET ALPHA THIS IS THE LARGEST TAKEDOWN IN WORLD HISTORY. ALPHA BAY STAFF MEMBERS CLAIM THIS GROUP SERVERS TO MORE THAN 40,000 A LEGAL VENDORS, PEOPLE WHO SELL ILLEGAL PRODUCTS, FOR MORE THAN 200,000 CUSTOMERS. BY FAR, MOST OF THIS ACTIVITY WAS IN ILLEGAL DRUGS, POURING FUEL ON THE FIRE OF A NATIONAL DRUG EPIDEMIC. AROUND THE TIME OF THE TAKEDOWN OF THIS SITE, THERE WERE MORE THAN 250,000 LISTINGS FOR ILLEGAL DRUGS AND TOXIC CHEMICALS ON ALPHA BAY. MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF ALL LISTINGS ON ALPHA BAY. AS OF EARLIER THIS YEAR, 122 VENDORS ADVERTISED FENTANYL. 238 ADVERTISED HEROINE. WE KNOW OF SEVERAL AMERICANS WHO WERE KILLED BY DRUGS ON ALPHA BAY. ONE VICTIM WAS JUST 18 YEARS OLD WHEN IN FEBRUARY SHE OVERDOSED ON A POWERFUL SYNTHETIC OPIOID WHICH SHE HAD BOUGHT ON ALPHA BAY. THE DRUG WISH IT TO HER HOUSE THROUGH THE MAIL. A LITTLE MORE THAN A WEEK AFTER HER DEATH, A VICTIM IN ORANGE COUNTY, FLORIDA DIED OF AN OVERDOSE FROM A DRUG BOUGHT ON ALPHA BAY. THEN THERE WAS GRANT SIEVER, ONLY 13 YEARS OF AGE, A STUDENT AT TREASURE MOUNTAIN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL, UTAH, PARK CITY. WHEN HE PASSED AWAY, AFTER OVERDOSING ON A SYNTHETIC OPIOID THAT HAD BEEN PURCHASED BY A CLASSMATE ON ALPHA BAY. THE ABILITY OF THESE DRUGS TO SO INSTANTANEOUSLY END THESE PROMISING LIVES IS A REMINDER TO US OF JUST HOW INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS THESE SYNTHETIC OPIOIDS ARE. ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE PURCHASED ANONYMOUSLY FROM DARK PLACES ON THE INTERNET. THIS IS LIKE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS OF THIS ENTIRE YEAR. I HAVE NO DOUBT OF THAT. MAKE NO MISTAKE, THE FORCES OF LAW AND JUSTICE FACE A CHALLENGE FROM CRIMINALS AND TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS WHO THINK THEY CAN COMMIT THEIR CRIMES WITH IMPUNITY BY GOING DARK. THIS CASE PURSUED BY DEDICATED AGENTS AND PROSECUTORS SAYS YOU ARE NOT SAFE. YOU CANNOT HIDE. WE WILL FIND YOU. DISMANTLING ORGANIZATION AND NETWORK, AND WE WILL PROSECUTE YOU. I BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE OF THIS OPERATION, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SAFER. PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD ARE SAFER TO SAVE HER FROM THE THREAT OF IDENTITY FRAUD AND MALWARE AND SAVE HER FROM DEADLY DRUGS. BUT THE DEPARTMENT WORK IS NOT FINISHED. WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIND, ARREST, PROSECUTE, CONVICT, AND INCARCERATE CRIMINALS, DRUG TRAFFICKERS, AND THEIR ENABLERS, WHEREVER THEY ARE. THE DARKNET IS NOT A PLACE TO HIDE. WE WILL USE EVERY TOOL WE HAVE TO STOP CRIMINALS FROM EXPLORING VULNERABLE PEOPLE AND SENDING SO MANY AMERICANS TO AN EARLY GRAVE, PERPETUATED BY THE TECHNOLOGY. I WANT TO THANK OUR INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS AT EUROPOL AND IN THAILAND, THE NETHERLANDS, LITHUANIA, CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, FRANCE, AND GERMANY, ALL OF WHOM HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH US TO TAKE DOWN THIS CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE. AND TO ALL THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL, AT THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION, FBI, AND THOSE AT THE IRS, CRIMINAL INVESTIGATORS, ATTORNEYS AND STAFF, ALL OF WHOM WORKED TIRELESSLY ON THIS CASE. YOU HAVE MADE US PROUD. YOU HAVE MADE THIS COUNTRY SAFER, AND WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR. ROSENSTEIN: THANK YOU, ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I'M GRATEFUL TO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS AND PROSECUTORS FOR THEIR TIRELESS WORK ON THIS CASE AND TO OUR INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS FOR THEIR SHORT IN EVERY CORPORATION. THE ALPHA BAY CASE IS PART OF A LARGER INTERNATIONAL EFFORT TO ATTACK DARK WEB MARKET BASIS. THEIR ALLEGED CONDUCT CONDUCT INCLUDES SELLING ILLEGAL DRUGS LIKE FENTANYL AND HEROIN, AS WELL AS STOLEN FRAUDULENT IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENTS AND ACCESS DEVICES, COUNTERFEIT GOODS, MALWARE IN COMPUTER HACKING TOOLS, FIREARMS, AND TOXIC CHEMICALS. THIS WAS A COORDINATED INTERNATIONAL OPERATION AGAINST ALPHA BAY AND ANOTHER WEBSITE WHICH THE DUTCH AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING AND SHUT DOWN EARLIER TODAY. AS PART OF THIS OPERATION, THE DUE SITE ADMINISTRATORS WERE ARRESTED AND AUTHORITY SEES EXTENSIVE EVIDENCE AND ILLICIT ASSETS RELATED TO THOSE ENTERPRISES. THIS CASE STARTED WITH SEVERAL INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS AND WE HAD THE ASSISTANCE OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES REPRESENTED HERE, AS WELL AS SEVERAL U.S. ATTORNEY OFFICES. WE JOIN TOGETHER WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS TO COORDINATE THE TIMING OF THE TAKEDOWN OF THESE WEBSITES. THE ALPHA BAY TAKEDOWN AND ARREST OF ITS ADMINISTRATOR COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF OUR INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS. THAT IS ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS CASE TODAY. WE WORKED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES IN THAILAND, THE NETHERLANDS, LITHUANIA, CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, FRANCE, AS WELL AS SUPPORT FROM EUROPOL. WE WILL HEAR FROM THE EUROPOL DIRECTOR THIS MORNING. THERE WERE MANY MOVING PARTS TO THIS INVESTIGATION. ALLEGED MEMBERS OF THE CONSPIRACY USED ANONYMIZING TECHNIQUES TRYING TO CONCEAL THEIR IDENTITIES AND LOCATIONS. PEELING BACK ONE THERE AFTER ANOTHER TOOK US TWO NEW COUNTRIES WHERE WE NEEDED ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE FROM OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. WITH EACH DEVELOPING IN THE CASE, OUR INTERNATIONAL COLLEAGUES EXPRESSED A WILLINGNESS TO ASSIST. DARK WEBSITES LIKE ALPHA BAY AND OTHERS RUN ON WHAT IS CALLED THE TOUR NETWORK. HIDDEN SERVICES DESIGNED TO CONCEAL INFORMATION THAT COULD REVEAL THE LOCATION OF A WEBSITE AND ITS CUSTOMERS. PEOPLE USING THESE WEBSITES BELIEVE THEY WILL BE ANONYMOUS, BUT THIS CASE DEMONSTRATES THAT IS NOT ALWAYS TRUE. MANY DARK WEBSITES OPENLY TRADE IN NARCOTICS, GUNS, IMAGES OF SEXUAL ABUSE OF CHILDREN, AND OTHER SERIOUS CRUEL CONDUCT. AN ACADEMIC STUDY FOUND THAT THE LARGEST SINGLE CATEGORY OF HIDDEN SERVICES ON THE NETWORK WAS FOUR RUNS FOR THE SALE OF DRUGS AND CONTRABAND. IT ALSO FOUND 80% OF TRAFFIC RELATED TO SEXUAL EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN. SOME SITES HAVE MEMBERSHIP OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF USERS ACROSS THE GLOBE. THOSE DISTURBING STATISTICS EXPLAIN WHY DISRUPTING AND DISMANTLING DARK WEBSITES IS A PRIORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. INTERNATIONAL CORN NATION IS CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS. ADMINISTRATORS AND USERS OF DARK WEBSITES USE ANONYMIZING TECHNIQUES TO THWART LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES. OUR AGENTS, PROSECUTORS, ANALYSTS, AND SUPPORT STAFF WORKED TIRELESSLY TO LOCATE THE INFRASTRUCTURE HOSTING THE SITES AND IDENTIFY THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM. THESE METHODS PROVEN ONGOING CHALLENGE FOR US. HUNDREDS OF SITES ON THE NETWORK STILL ENABLE A VAST AMOUNT OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY TO OCCUR BUT WE ARE PROUD OF THE ACCOUNT IS THAT WE ANNOUNCED TODAY AND RECOGNIZE OUR WORK IS NOT DONE. WE FACE MANY CHALLENGES AND READING INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE TO OVERCOME THOSE CHALLENGES. EXCEPTIONAL FOREIGN CORPORATION WITH OUR OPERATION TO ATTACK A LEGAL ACTIVITY ON THE DARK WEB DEMONSTRATES INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH US TO DENY SAFE HAVENS AND CYBERCRIME. THAT HELPS US TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY, SAFETY, AND SECURITY OF ALL AMERICANS. ONE OTHER DEVELOPMENT I WANT TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION, FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF THE DEFENDANT CHARGED IN THE AMERICAN CASE, OUR U.S. ATTORNEY AND EASTERN CALIFORNIA FILED A CIVIL COMPLAINT WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT APPROPRIATE ACTION IS TAKEN WITH REGARD TO ALL THE ASSETS THAT WERE SEIZED IN THE COURSE OF THAT INVESTIGATION. THIS TIME I WANT TO DEDUCE THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE FBI, AND INDICATE. MR. MCCABE: GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE. THIS IS A LANDMARK OPERATION. ALPHA BAY WAS ROUGHLY 10 TIMES THE SIZE OF THE SILK ROAD, SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MULTIPLE SERVERS, DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CRYPTO CURRENCY, IN A DARKNET DRUG TRADE THAT SPAN THE GLOBE. IT TAKES A LOT OF COORDINATION AND A SHARED PURPOSE TO PULL OFF AN OPERATION LIKE THIS, SO WITH YOUR PATIENCE, I LIKE TO THANK A FEW OF THE FOLKS WITH WHOM WE WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY. FIRST, I'D LIKE TO THANK THE FBI SACRAMENT OF FIELD OFFICE WHO TOOK THE LABORING OR IN MAKING THIS OPERATION FOR SUCCESS. I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK OUR FOLKS IN THE ATLANTIC, PITTSBURGH, PHILADELPHIA, CHICAGO FIELD OFFICES, AS WELL AS THE FBI'S CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION AT HEADQUARTERS, CYBER DIVISION, AND LEGAL OFFICES OVERSEAS. THESE TEAMS DID AMAZING WORK AND WE ARE UNDER NO ILLUSION THAT WE DO THIS TYPE OF WORK ON OUR OWN. WE ARE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL TO OUR PARTNERS IN THAILAND, THE NETHERLANDS, LITHUANIA, CANADA, THE U.K., FRANCE, AS WELL AS OUR PARTNERS IN EUROPOL. WE WANT TO THANK HOURS PARTNERS-- OUR DUTCH PARTNERS IN TAKING DOWN THE WEBSITE TO WHICH MANY OF THE ALPHA BAY USERS AND VENDORS FLOCKED AFTER THE DEMISE OF ALPHA BAY. TAKING DOWN TO MAJOR DARK SITES AT ONCE IS CONSIDERABLE AND IT TOOK A LOT OF EFFORT, A LOT OF EXPERTISE, AND TEAMWORK. AS THIS LEVEL OF TEAMWORK AND COORDINATION SHOWS, WE WILL GO TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH TO FIND THESE PEOPLE AND TO STOP THEM. THERE ARE SOME CRIMINALS THAT THINK OF CYBERCRIME AS A FREEBIE . A THINK THEY WILL GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE THERE ARE TOO MANY PLAYERS AND TOO MANY COUNTRIES DO THEY THINK THEY WILL GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE THE SCHEMES ARE TOO COMPLEX AND BECAUSE THEY OPERATE IN THE SHADOWS. BUT WE ARE BLENDING TRADITIONAL INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES AND NEW TOOLS TO BRING THESE INDIVIDUALS OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND INTO THE LIGHT. THE FBI'S HIGH-TECH ORGANIZED CRIME UNIT TARGET CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES THAT CONDUCT TRADITIONAL CRIMINAL ACTIVITY LIKE MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE SALE OF ILLICIT GOODS THROUGH COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET. TOGETHER WITH FOLKS FROM THE CYBER DIVISION, VOMIT CRIME, CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN PROGRAMS, WE ARE WORKING TO GET EVEN THE GET BETWEEN COMPUTER INTRUSIONS THAT TARGET OUR DATA AND TECHNOLOGY, AND TRADITIONAL CRIMES FACILITATED BY TECHNOLOGY, LIKE THE DARKNET. THIS TEAMWORK TO LEGITIMATE TO IDENTIFY THE LOCATION OF THE ALPHA BAY INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO IDENTIFY THE ADMINISTRATOR, AND TO SHUT DOWN THE SITE ARE GOOD. CRITICS WILL SAY AS WE SHUDDER ONE SIDE, ANOTHER WILL EMERGE. AND THEY MAY BE RIGHT. BUT THAT IS THE NATURE OF CRIMINAL WORK. IT NEVER GOES AWAY, YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY KEEP AT IT, AND YOU HAVE TO USE EVERY TOOL IN YOUR TOOLBOX. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WILL DO. WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT OVER THE YEARS ABOUT TAKING DOWN INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL SYNDICATES, AND THAT SAME EXPERIENCE APPLIES TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE FACILITATED ON THE DARKNET. WE KNOW THAT REMOVING TOP CRIMINALS FROM THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT A LONG-TERM FIX. THERE IS ALWAYS A NEW PLAYER WAITING IN THE WINGS READY TO FILL THOSE SHOES. IT IS LIKE DEMOLISHING A BUILDING. HACKING AWAY AT INDIVIDUAL WALLS AND BEAMS ONLY DOES SO MUCH WHEN USING FEDERAL STATUTES TO PROSECUTE THESE INDIVIDUALS IS AKIN TO BLOG FOUNDATION WITH DYNAMITE. ONCE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPLODES, IT BECOMES DIFFICULT FOR THE GROUP TO FUNCTION. THE WEIGHT OF THIS KIND OF OPERATION, THE ORGANIZATION CRUMBLES. WE WILL KEEP DOING THIS GREAT WORK AND WILL CONTINUE TO COUNT ON OUR FEDERAL COUNTERPARTS AND INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS TO BE WITH US. NOW I LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO ONE OF OUR ABSOLUTE CLOSEST PARTNERS AND BEST COLLEAGUES FROM THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION, ROBERT PATTISON, ACTING DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR. MR. PATTISON: GOOD MORNING. I AM PLEASED TO REPRESENT THE DEA AND JOIN THE OTHER LITTLE AND COLLEAGUES IN ANNOUNCING THE TAKEDOWN. EXTREMELY DEDICATED INVESTIGATORS, ANALYSTS, AND PROSECUTORS WORK TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE. I GREATLY APPRECIATE THE LARGER COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS OF ALL OF OUR OTHER FEDERAL PARTNERS INCLUDING THE FBI, IRS, UNITED STATES POSTAL INSPECTION SERVICE, AND HOMELAND SECURITY. AS DIRECTOR MCCABE NOTED, THESE CASES DEMAND INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION AND COOPERATION. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE WORK OF OUR FEDERAL, FELLOW LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS IN THAILAND, THE NETHERLANDS, LITHUANIA, CANADA, UNITED KINGDOM, FRANCE, AND OBVIOUSLY EUROPOL. WE ARE ALL SAVVY REMINDED ON A DAILY BASIS, OUR NATION CONTINUES TO FACE AN OPIOID EPIDEMIC. THE DARK WEB IS AN AVAILABLE AND SEEMINGLY ANONYMOUS MARKETPLACE FOR THE SALE OF THESE DRUGS. A DEA CONTINUES TO BE FULLY COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING THIS EPIDEMIC. WE ARE ATTACKING THE PROBLEM FROM MULTIPLE ANGLES. FROM THE TRADITIONAL ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS TARGETING THE MAJOR SOURCES OUTSIDE OF OUR BORDERS THAT FEEL UNTOUCHABLE TO THEIR NETWORKS THAT BRING THE DRUGS ACROSS OUR BORDERS INTO THIS COUNTRY, TO THE VIOLENT STREET GANGS THAT SELL THE DEADLY POISON IN OUR LOCAL NEIGHBORHOODS, AND TO THE CORRUPT DOCTORS IN ROGUE PHARMACIES INVOLVED IN THE DIVERSION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. ALTHOUGH THE BUSINESS MODELS OF THESE GROUPS VARY, THEY ARE SIMILAR WHEN IT COMES TO THE DISTRACTION THEY CAUSE. THEY ALL SHARE ONE ADDITIONAL COMMON CHARACTERISTIC. THEY OPERATE ON BORROWED TIME. THE ALPHA BAY CRIMINAL NETWORK WAS YET ANOTHER CONTRIBUTOR SOURCE FEEDING THIS EPIDEMIC, SUPPLYING COUNTLESS ATTICS THROUGH DIRECT SALES AND SUPPLYING DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO RUN THIS COUNTRY AND OTHERS WITH LARGER QUANTITIES FOR REDISTRIBUTION. ALPHA BAY WAS THE LARGEST DARK MARKET PLATFORM OPERATING ON THE DARK WEB, RESPONSIBLE FOR APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION IN ILLICIT SALES. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION WHICH CAME AS A RESULT OF PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF DRUGS LIKE FENTANYL AND HEROIN. AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BROUGHT UP, MORE THAN 250,000 LISTINGS FOR ILLEGAL DRUGS WERE ON THAT SITE AT THE TIME IT WAS TAKEN DOWN. THE DARK WEB SEEMINGLY ALLOWS FOR ANONYMITY AND CREATES EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGES FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT AS WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED IN THIS CASE, THESE CHALLENGES ARE NOT INSURMOUNTABLE. ALEXANDER LEARNED WHAT SO MANY OTHERS HAVE. HARD WORK AND DETERMINATION BY OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS DEMONSTRATE NO ONE IS UNTOUCHABLE. ELECTIVELY, WE WILL LEVERAGE OUR LEGAL AUTHORITIES AND CAPABILITIES WITH CONTINUED DETERMINATION TO IDENTIFY AND TARGET CRIMINALS WHEREVER THEY MAY HIDE, WHICH INCLUDE CYBERSPACE. WE ARE KEENLY AWARE THERE WILL BE ANOTHER ALPHA BAY. BUT WITH EACH INVESTIGATION WE LEARN MORE AND GET THAT HER. WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE THESE-- THOSE ATTEMPTING TO HIDE BEHIND THE ANONYMITY OF THE DARK WEB. I WANT TO THANK THE DEDICATED MEN AND WOMEN OF THE DEA AND OUR PARTNER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FOR THEIR INCREDIBLE WORK ON THIS PARTICULAR OPERATION. AND TO THE METAL -- MANY FEDERAL PROSECUTORS THAT WORK TIRELESSLY TO BRING THESE CRIMINALS TO JUSTICE TO PROTECT OUR CITIZENS. WITH THAT, I LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE YOUR POLL DIRECTOR -- THE EUROPOL DIRECTOR. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. ON THE FINAL SPEAKER, SO WE WILL HOLD YOUR ATTENTION FOR A FEW MINUTES MORE. THANK YOU TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, COLLEAGUES OF THE DOJ FOR INVITING ME TO BE A PART OF THIS EVENT TODAY. WE ARE PLEASED THAT EUROPOL PLAYED OUR PART IN COORDINATING THE INTERNATIONAL DIMENSIONS OF THIS GROUNDBREAKING OPERATION, ESPECIALLY IN EUROPE. AS YOU HAVE HEARD, THIS OUTSTANDING LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTION HERE IN THE U.S. TO BRING TO AN END ALPHA BAY WAS COORDINATED WITH SIMULTANEOUS ACTION IN EUROPE, AGAINST ANOTHER MAJOR MARKETPLACE. THE SHUTTING DOWN OF THAT, THE DUTCH AUTHORITIES ARE ANNOUNCING RIGHT NOW IN THE NETHERLANDS AT THEIR OWN PRESS CONFERENCE. THESE TWO CASES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TOGETHER AND OUR JOINT HIT ON BOTH OF THESE DARK MARKETS IS ONE OF THE MOST SOPHISTICATED LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS AGAINST CYBERCRIME THAT WE HAVE EVER SEEN. SO THE SCALE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF, YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE FIGURES. ALPHA BAY AND THE MARKET BETWEEN THEM WERE TWO OF THE TOP THREE CRIMINAL MARKETPLACES ON A DARK WEB. TRADING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ILLICIT COMMODITIES, DRUGS, AND MANY OTHERS, THE DETAILS OF WHICH YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT. THAT IS 40,000 VENDORS DEPENDING ON THE MARKETPLACE TO SELL EVERYTHING FROM FENTANYL TO LEGAL FIREARMS AND MALWARE FOR CYBERCRIME ATTACKS. THEY COORDINATE A TAKEDOWN AND HAS PUNCHED A BIG HOLE IN THE OPERATING ABILITY OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND OTHER SERIOUS CRIMINALS AROUND THE WORLD. BUT WHAT MADE THIS OPERATION REALLY SPECIAL WAS THE STRATEGY WE RAN TO MAGNIFY THE DISRUPTIVE IMPACT OF THE JOINT ACTIONS. BETWEEN EUROPOL, FBI, DEA, DUTCH POLICE, THE TEAM PLAY THAT WE RAN HERE WAS TO TAKE OVER CONTROL OF THE HANSA MARKET UNDER DUTCH JUDICIAL AUTHORITY A MONTH AGO, WHICH ALLOWED US TO MONITOR THE ACTIVITIES, CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES OF USERS, WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE, AND THEN SHUT DOWN ALPHA BAY DURING THE SAME PERIOD. WHAT THIS MEANT, IN PARTICULAR, WAS THAT WE COULD IDENTIFY AND DISRUPT THE REGULAR CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT WAS HAPPENING ON HANSA MARKET BUT ALSO SWEEP UP ALL OF THOSE NEW USERS THAT WERE DISPLACED FROM ALPHA BAY AND LOOKING FOR A NEW TRADING PLOT FORM FOR THEIR CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES. IN FACT, THEY FLOCK TO HANSA IN DROVES. WE RECORDED AN EIGHT TIMES INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF HUMAN USERS ON HANSA IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE TAKEDOWN OF ALPHA BAY. SINCE THE UNDERCOVER OPERATION TO TAKE OVER HANSA MARKET BY THE DUTCH POLICE, USERNAMES AND PASSWORDS OF THOUSANDS OF BUYERS AND SELLERS OF ILLICIT COMMODITIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND ARE THE SUBJECT OF FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATIONS BY EUROPOL AND OUR PARTNER AGENCIES. SO AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT STRATEGY, THEREFORE, LEVERAGING THE COMBINED OPERATIONAL AND TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES OF MULTIPLE AGENCIES HERE IN THE U.S. AND AROUND EUROPE HAS BEEN AN EXTRA ORDINARY SUCCESS. AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE COLLECTIVE POWER WE CAN BRING A CONCERTED GLOBAL LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY TO WORK AGAINST EVEN THE MOST CHALLENGING SERIOUS CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES. MY RESPECT AND ADMIRATION GOES TO ALL THOSE INVOLVED HERE IN THE U.S., THE NETHERLANDS, MANY OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS MANY OF MY OWN COLLEAGUES IN EUROPOL. THERE ARE THREE OTHER MAJOR IMPLICATIONS IN ITS OPERATIONS. FIRSTLY, THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE UNDERGROUND CRIMINAL ECONOMY HAS TAKEN A SERIOUS HIT. A MUCH BIGGER EVEN THAN WHAT WE SAW IN 2013 WITH SILK ROAD. SECONDLY, THE INTELLIGENCE WE HAVE YIELDED THROUGH THE MONITORING OF HANSA HAS GIVEN US NEW INSIGHT INTO THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY OF THE DARKNET, INCLUDING MANY OF ITS MANY LEADING FIGURES. WE HAVE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH EUROPOL NEW INTELLIGENCE LEADS CONNECTED TO DARKNET TO ALREADY 37 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. FINALLY, OF COURSE, AS YOU HAVE HEARD, THERE IS A VERY STRONG MESSAGE HERE. TO THOSE WHO ENGAGE IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY ON THE INTERNET AND THE DARKNET ESPECIALLY YOU ARE NOT AS SAFE AND ANONYMOUS AS YOU THINK YOU ARE. THIS OPERATION IS EXAMPLE OF THE IMPROVING CONCERTED ABILITY OF LAW OR SMITH TO STRIKE AGAINST CRIMINALS, EVEN ON THE DARKNET. EUROPOL'S STANDING OF A NEW INTERNATIONAL TEAM TO MONITOR DARKNET MUCH -- MARKET PLACES IN THE FUTURE. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN TODAY FROM THIS COORDINATED HIT AGAINST THESE TWO MARKETPLACES IS JUST A TASTE OF WHAT IS TO COME IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS, THIS IS NOT REALLY A NORMAL DAY. THE PRESIDENT MADE VERY DISPARAGING REMARKS ABOUT YOU, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES, DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL YESTERDAY. GIVEN WHAT HE SAID, WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THOSE REMARKS, HOW SERIOUSLY ARE YOU CONSIDERING POSSIBLY RESIGNING? MR. SESSION: WE IN THIS DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE EVERY SINGLE DAY TO WORK HARD TO SERVE THE NATIONAL INTEREST AND WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY JOIN IN THE PRIORITIES THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP -- HE GAVE US SEVERAL DIRECTIVES. ONE IS TO DISMANTLE INTERNET TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE ANNOUNCING TODAY. DISMANTLING OF THE LARGEST DARK WEBSITE IN THE WORLD BY FAR. I CONGRATULATE OUR PEOPLE FOR THAT. I HAVE THE HONOR OF SERVING AS ATTORNEY GENERAL. IT IS SOMETHING THAT GOES BEYOND ANY THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE EVER HAD FOR MYSELF. WE LOVE THIS JOB. WE LOVE THIS DEPARTMENT. I PLAN TO CONTINUE TO DO SO AS LONG AS THAT IS APPROPRIATE. &gt;&gt; ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS, HOW DO YOU FEEL YOU CAN EFFECTIVELY SERVE FROM HERE ON OUT, IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PRESIDENT? MR. SESSIONS: WE ARE SERVING RIGHT NOW. THE WORK WE ARE DOING TODAY IS THE KIND OF WORK THAT WE INTEND TO CONTINUE. JUST LAST WEEK, WE ANNOUNCED THE LARGEST HEALTH CARE TAKEDOWN EVER IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAD ALL THE MAJOR LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERS IN MY OFFICE YESTERDAY TO TALK ABOUT UNIFIED EFFORTS TO IMPROVE CRIME-FIGHTING WITH STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS. I AM TOTALLY CONFIDENT WE CAN CONTINUE TO RUN THIS OFFICE IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY. BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE FOR YOU TO FOCUS NOW ON THE WORK OF THE INDIVIDUAL BEHIND ME, THAT HAVE HELPED BUT THIS CASE TOGETHER, SO THAT WE CAN CELEBRATE AND AFFIRM THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE DONE, SO THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM IT, AND GET EVEN BETTER IN THE FUTURE. &gt;&gt; DECK THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ROSENSTEIN, THE PRESIDENT TOLD A NEW YORK TIMES, THE FACT THAT YOU ARE FROM BALTIMORE CONCERNS HIM BECAUSE THERE. IS THAT A VALID CONCERN IN YOUR VIEW, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? MR. ROSENSTEIN: WE ARE WORKING EVERY DAY TO ADVANCE THE PRIORITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. PROUD TO BE SURE YESTERDAY, PROUD TO BE HERE TODAY, PROUD TO WORK YOUR TOMORROW. WE ARE SPENDING EVERY MINUTE TO ADVANCE THE INTEREST OF THE DEPARTMENT. AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID, WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS ALPHA BAY CASE, AN IMPORTANT CASE. WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS HERE THAT ASSISTED IN THE INVESTIGATION. THAT IS ALL I WILL TALK ABOUT TODAY. Source: URL"

I am not involved in DNM's nor am I involved with LE. I am just an individual who finds this whole thing very interesting and I thought I would post here because I found most of the analysis and info here to be very poor quality TL;DR I believe their may be parts of this operation that have not yet occurred in the UK and France and people based in those countries should be very cautious.

10,cyber-crime,DarkNetMarkets,Greece arrests Russian suspected of running $4 billion bitcoin laundering ring,47,6pp0gg,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/6pp0gg/greece_arrests_russian_suspected_of_running_4/,2017-07-27 02:01:26,"URL ATHENS (Reuters) - A Russian man suspected of laundering at least $4 billion of criminal funds by switching them into the digital currency bitcoin has been arrested in Greece, police said on Wednesday. Police sources identified the individual as Alexander Vinnik, 38. After a tip-off, he was arrested in a small beachside village in northern Greece, on a U.S. warrant, and police said the United States would seek to extradite him. ""Since 2011 the 38-year-old has been running a criminal organization which administers one of the most important websites of electronic crime in the world,"" police said in a statement, describing an alleged money laundering operation that ""legalizes proceeds from illegal activities"". It was thought that 'at least' $4 billion in cash had been laundered through a bitcoin platform since 2011; the platform had 7 million bitcoins deposited, and 5.5 million bitcoins in withdrawals. Bitcoin was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden, making traditional financial regulation difficult if not impossible. The detainee was held on four counts of running an unlicensed money-transfer operation, conspiracy, money laundering in violation of 17 acts in the U.S. criminal code, and transactions in cash acquired through illicit means. The Russian Foreign Ministry in Moscow said it had no information on the case. In a separate prominent cybercrime case, the United States is seeking to extradite another Russian, Peter Levashov, from Spain. U.S. prosecutors have charged him with hacking offences, saying he operated a network of tens of thousands of infected computers used by cyber criminals."

""They pay through bitcoins and the couriers containing LSD blot papers and MDMA crystals are sent directly to Hyderabad,"" said enforcement director Akun Sabharwal. &gt; Though the accused confessed to have used the underbelly of the web to obtain drugs, it is not easy to identify sellers.

Operation Astatine was launched early last year to investigate a NSW-based criminal network involved in drug trafficking and tobacco smuggling. The investigation includes members of the Australian Federal Police, NSW Police, Australian Border Force, Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission and the NSW Crime Commission. Police will allege in court that the syndicate conspired to import 200 kilograms of MDMA by ship and were also responsible for smuggling 50 million cigarettes into Australia. On Tuesday, August 8, a two-day operation was launched targeting members allegedly connected to the syndicate. A total of 13 search warrants were executed at dozens of Sydney homes. A controlled delivery, using a substituted inert substance, was carried out in Sydney on Tuesday and delivered to an address in Rosebery. A 52-year-old Queensland man was later arrested for allegedly transporting and accessing the substance. During the search warrants this week, seized around 80 kg of cocaine at an address in Rosebery, and $740,000 cash across four properties in Edmonson Park, St Peters, Hurstville and Arncliffe. A further $2 million was also seized during the course of the investigation. A second parallel investigation - codenamed Operation Zeus - was launched into an ABF officer, who has been charged for allegedly using his position to assist the syndicate avoid police. A former Australian Customs and Border Protection Service officer has also been charged with similar offences regarding her alleged conduct during the period of this investigation. A 47-year-old NSW man was arrested in the United Arab Emirates by the Dubai police anti-narcotics department. Police are currently seeking his extradition. Other people arrested include: A Rockdale man, 54, has been charged with offences relating to drug importation, directing a criminal group, conspiracy to defraud, money laundering and smuggling (tobacco).

A Hurstville woman, 41, is charged with offences including conspiracy to bribe, smuggling, assisting a criminal group and dealing in proceeds of crime. AFP Coordinator of Organised Crime and Cyber, Detective Superintendent Stephen Dametto, said that a high degree of sophistication and collaboration was required to combat these groups. This operation is a warning to organised crime targeting Australia that hiding on the other side of the world wont save you, he said. Once you are in our sights, we will focus our efforts on causing you and your predatory criminal activities as much damage as possible. NSW Police Commander Organised Crime Squad, Detective Superintendent Scott Cook praised the work of investigators. Todays operation brings to a conclusion 10 months of hard work by the members of the NSW JOCG and has resulted in an excellent outcome for the NSW community, he said. The transnational nature of organised crime in NSW is now highly-complex and difficult to combat, yet the resolve of your police is unwavering. We will continue to develop our partnerships, locally, nationally and internationally to ensure we have the reach necessary to crush organised crime activities impacting NSW."

15,cyber-crime,DarkNetMarkets,Treat everyone like a FED,47,5x9ygj,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/5x9ygj/treat_everyone_like_a_fed/,2017-03-03 23:00:09,"Props to Deleverything Firstly Id like to say that the idea of the lesson is not to to dissuade you from the dangers the FBI pose. It is to educate you that they only pose dangers so long as you perform actions or retain aspects that make you the lowest hanging fruit or if you let their mind games get to you and make you do something stupid. For anyone here who is unaware the ""lowest hanging fruit"" Is, it's a term thats assigned to those who are the easiest for the FBI or the NSA or anyone to catch. Basically if you pull a stupid thing and think ""Oh theres no way the FBI will pay attention to me"" Or you pull off a stupid thing and don't cover your ass? Guess what you're the lowest hanging fruit. You're the type of person the FBI chew up and show off as examples to the rest of the world that you should keep employing them because they're ""doing good in the world by arresting people like you"" Now I'm going to be showing you a lot of things in this class that will make you think that the FBI are worthless. Which they are. But never underestimate a criminal organization that has the power to put you in a cell for 20+ years for breaking what they deem as the law or because they want to. We are going to be observing 3 case studies on the matter and I'll leave about 5-6 minutes of questions between each case and will answer all that I can. If I don't answer your question try asking again during the next break or wait until the end where I'll keep online to answer everything. In addition please note that these are just three cases out of hundreds, each pulling the same theme which I will show to you in these few. The first of our case studies is on what's known as the Blackshades takedown. Blackshades for anyone unfamiliar was a rootkit that was operated and dispensed just like a business on clearnet. They provided updates, had a team for handling purchases, tech support even. The problem is when you're peddling a product that can land you 20 something years in jail or longer someone in your team is probably going to be a fed. More on that later though. Roughly a week before the infamous blackshades takedown this was posted and spread throughout the community: URL  UP20140514 I want you all to give it a quick glance over while I continue talking and laugh at the ridiculousness of some of their quotes. My favorite ones include ""There is a philosophy change. If you are going to attack Americans, we are going to hold you accountable,"" And ""If we can reach out and touch you, we are going to reach out and touch you."" Gotta love that pure unadulterated level of self importance. mmmmm love that shit. 10/10 would have it for breakfast every morning before my daily bowl of cereal. So a week after that goldmine of an article was put out the FBI sacked the fuck up and busted the writer of the blackshades malware as well as his team. Surprise surprise one of the people on this massive team were a federal agent who had personal information revealed to him because a Trust model on the Darknet is TOTALLY something you want to do when you're distributing a piece of code that can land you 20+ years in jail. (rolls eyes) Please keep in mind if you ever tend to play the Darknet game for money, for secrets/information, or just straight power. Please fucking remember that 1 in 3 people on the Darknet are confirmed feds. But that shouldn't concern you so long as you trust everyone equally and treat everyone like a fed, because if you can pull that off nobody will be able to touch you. And really that goes for anywhere. If you go into a place and complain ""oh oo its infested with feds"" then that means you've already failed at your fucking opsec. Because the fact that you're worried a few people might be fed means that you don't treat everyone like feds already. Which means you give out special trust and permissions to certain people or users who you think ""Aren't feds"" This is the shit that gets you arrested people. Learn it. If you're under a name that has done confirmed illegal shit then you should treat everyone like a fed, snitch, or someone who will rat you out for their own gain. But if you come on twitter or wherever for the sake of fun and friends then dont do anything illegal. This is compartmentalization 101. Also there's a common rule when it comes to either hacking or fraud, and I think it's a pretty good rule to follow when doing anything cyber-related thats illegal. Assume that every tool of anonymity is broken. Every layer is traceable. And that the FBI can break any level of encryption you have. Now ask yourself, what's your setup? And that's how you should think, that's how you stay two steps ahead of these games the fed try to play on everyone and that's how you avoid being the lowest hanging fruit. Aka the key to living a long and happy Darknet career. But enough on that back to the lesson. I want you all to go and take a look at the press release they put out here: URL  e-takedown I want you to take a look at the wording of a certain section, preferably the second paragraph. &gt;Also charged and arrested in the US were an individual who helped market and sell the the malware + two blackshades users in the usa who bought the malware. That paired with the ""Oh we arrested 90+ people"" stated in the press release would make you think that they caught more people than just the users and the devs/team that peddled it. Wrong. About 3 weeks later it was found via a magical group of rednecks who will not be named that the only people arrested were (get this) and I quote: ""Users who bought the malware on hackforums using a paypal tied to their real names."" I want you to let that shit sink in for a moment, that is literally the most un-technically impressive takedown in the fucking world. Really? Hackforum users who bought fucking MALWARE with their REAL paypals? You may as well have walked up to the FBI headquarters and shouted ""HELLO YES I AM CRIMINAL PLS ARREST"". Good fucking job FBI, we should all give them a round of applause for that ultra sack of fucking bravery and skill. Point is this is a re-occuring theme you're going to see in eh roughly 90% of any Cyber op the FBI take hold of. A) Do something unimpressive as fucking hell. B) Try to word it in a way on the shiny press release that you did a lot of work. C) Exploit the fearing fuck out of it and make your target paranoid as all hell if they took part of it or plan to. In this case the target audience being current tor/Darknet users, and new people thinking about getting into the game. As it is with just about every ""takedown"". It should be noted though that they didn't lie in the press release though, two USA people were arrested for buying it. Because the others who used their real paypals were foreign. So basically just came down to clever wording. It should also be noted that the article was released the week before the blackshades takedown on rueters on how ""If we can reach out and touch you, we will reach out and touch you."" Was this intentionally spread throughout the script kid level community by the FBI though? I'll leave that to your own rationale to decide. Now then. I'd like to bring you to our second case study. Operation Onymous. I wrote up a satirical piece on the analysis I'm about to give you via URL Here's the rundown however. On November 5th, 2014 the FBI had announced the takedown of 414 .onion Darknet services. When it first happened, everyone FREAKED out. Can't even tell you how many fucking people came up to us asking ""Is TOR Broken!!?!?"" and we had to respond with ""We don't know at this point"", which I'm sure didn't inspire new users or normies to get into the trade and deterred normie Darknet users like kingpins from continuing business on the tor network. We were in the dark for about 2+ weeks before we knew what happened. Anyways. On their press release they mentioned the takedown of things like Doxbin, Silk Road 2, and an ISIS funding website that accepted anonymous Bitcoin donations. Now for anyone unfamiliar about how Darknet culture sites n stuff is, there is no Google overlords to protect you against spam sites. Meaning if you make a marketplace, someone could just download the source code and put it up under another .onion and basically try to pawn it off as the real thing. Essentially it's a way of scamming, it's really popular on DN. SO IT TURNS OUT RIGHT. That about only 27 Darknet sites which were raided in that 414 website count were real. Which means that the FBI literally seized 387 other sites which turned out to be SCAM WEBSITE CLONES. Which also means that the ISIS funding site they had listed on their page under ""Things we took down"" was also a scam onion. Meaning the real .onion for that ISIS site is still up. Good job, feds. Which leads to the question of....why? Why would the feds take down so many clone websites? Was it on accident? On purpose? The answer is that it wasn't a targeted takedown of .onion services. The answer was revealed that all they did was go up to a hosting website which I will not mention here, and then shut them down because they were hosting ALLLLLLLLLLL these services. And then they made it SEEM like it was a targeted attack. It was only thanks to our researchers that we found out so many were clone / scam sites. Of course you can IMAGINE how fucking terrified everyone was for those 2+ weeks of being in the dark about the details. ""Is Tor broken?"" ""Is our crypto broken?"" Etc etc. I hope by now you're seeing the pattern I mentioned in Law Enforcements ""Takedowns"" &gt;Do something technically unimpressive &gt;Pawn it off like it is impressive &gt;Exploit the fear generated by keeping people in the dark about the details. Last case study, this one is on Silk Road 2 afterwhich my man rackham will give some details on a new ""Takdown"" of a pedo site that the Feds recently did that I myself have not researched yet. This is still within Operation Onymous as it happened at the same time but it was not taken down in the same manner as the other .onion's. This was actually the one targeted .onion in the entire operation. So this last one is going to be relatively brief because it's more or less a repetition of all the shit I've pointed out before in terms of the pattern the FBI so dearly cling to. The too long didn't read version of Silk Road 2 is that a few autistic motherfuckers who had no idea what the hell they were doing much like Dread Pirate Roberts the owner of the first one, decided ""Hey we should totally cash in on this Silk Road name thing and put up a clone"". A few hours of shite code edits and changes later you have the most scammy deplorable market on the Darknet. The owner of this travesty known as Defcon was probably the most useless fuck imaginable who got Doxed (Dox confirmed when he was taken to jail for what will probably be life) within I think it was the first 4 months of operating his market? Yea GG. #ThisIsHowYouDarknet So anyway this is more of a hilarious point that the FBI handled, but when asked how they managed to get the .onion's server IP location they said and I quote: ""We managed to get the IP of the server by fiddling around with the login screen for about an hour"" Rightttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt. Personally I think they just had a fed somewhere on the inner circle and didn't want to rouse suspicion so they lied through their fuckin teeth cause they still want the fucker undercover. But what the fuck ever we could speculate all day. Now the FBI knew for a fact that nobody fucking liked or cared for Silk Road 2 because the staff kept scamming the users and vendors and the market itself was unreliable and scam centraly as fuck. Which is why they included it within Operation Onymous. For what reason? To spread the fear and worry that Operation Onymous was a targetted attack. Think about it, if you got something like a Darknet Market alongside other services like Doxbin the first thing that would come to your mind is that the attack is targeted in terms of they exploited some massive flaw or something within TOR or Relay servers or whatever. And that was how they used the OP to scare as many people as possible. And guess what. It worked for the most part. Which brings me to my final point. The reason that the FBI keep resorting to fear and lack of basic fucking understanding of the inner workings and layers of the Darknet is because fear and social engineering is all they know, and it's all they have in this battlefield. Their organization for decades has been dedicated to hunting Physical crime, which they are good at and I'll give them props for that. The problem is that on the internet it is much MUCH easier to be an attacker than a defender. Fear is all they fucking know to do, because it's the only real tool they have in this unwinnable war against all crime ever. True story, the FBI have actually put up ads stating ""You can now smoke weed and work for us in the cyber division!"". You know what I call that? Desperate. The FBI know they're fighting a war that can't be fucking won. Because they need us. They want us so bad. And they know that the whitehats they have employed don't half even half the skill that the Blackhats of the net have, much less the common fraudster. That's why they're attempting to backdoor and censor our internets so they might gain a fighting chance. But so long as you stay two steps ahead of whatever game they try to play, they will never beat you. Now my man rackham wanted to share some stats for the playpen fiasco since a few of you asked about that. yeah before the flood of questions come and because this is in the news a lot recently the vulnerability that they utilized and everybody is so spun up about was PATCHED in the Tor browser. before the FBI is thought to have used it, it is suspected to be a variant of Rapid 7's decloak (google it if you don't know) so tl;dr. patch your shit and disable javascript. number love numbers someone get a calculator out for me so we all know the story. FBI seizes server and hosts CP for like 2 months or something and they're talking about how big this site is and over 200k users, right. they deanonymized 1300 IPs, can i get a percentage quick? you guys are too slow its .0065% POINT lol 0 0 6 5 ,okay lets go further, now this was quick google. numbers may have changed but as of April 14 can anybody guess how many of the 1300/200K+ were actually arrested? 135. add another 0 in there .000675 percent. throw a tee-ball player in the MLB and they'll bat a better percentage. also, the way they found the server? an unnamed foreign country found it on the clearweb admin SSH to the server from his home IP RIP GG. at the end of the day, one thing we can see in all of this is; 1) encryption DOES work when used correctly 2) the infosec community is not the only ones selling FUD the FBI will use fear, uncertainty, and doubt, that is their only weapon. that is not to say they are not a danger, but don't get it twisted, they're not fuckin skilled in the least. so to break it down playpen had 200,000 users, they hacked 8000 computers out of those 8000, they identifed 1300 suspected pedophiles of those 1300, they charged 137 and now we learn in the most recent update to this case that they aren't actually able to even charge that 137. great. The parting lesson to take home is, stay two steps ahead in whatever you do. And if you're in the game for anything illegal, treat everyone like a fed. Making friends is not your priority, and trust is the last thing you want. Can be found here URL"

This occurred in Ireland a few weeks ago. From URL **Darknet Vendor Duo May Face Long Prison Sentence** November 27, 2016 A Belfast judge warned two men that they faced substantial prison sentences. The warningor threatwas for a lucrative darknet drug dealing racket. According to court documents, the men made several hundred thousand dollars. Belfast Crown Court heard the darknet enterprise described as a sophisticated and commercial operation. The enterprise consisted of three men. 1. Richard Charles Patrick Sinclair, a 32-year-old from Cranagh Road, Coleraine. 2. Kyle James Hall from Chamberlain Street in east Belfast. 3. And Stephen Rodgers, a 29-year-old from Glynn Park Close, Carrickfergus, Co Antrim. The darknet: Two of the men heard the warning for their substantial role in the networks operation. But Rodgers, the third suspect, was a patsy, according to his lawyer. Sinclair used his grandmothers house as a base of operations. He bought drugs from Holland on the darknet. Then, upon receiving them, would resell the drugs to customers. Investigators pointed out that Sinclair made heavy use of DVD cases. The DVD cases were for darknet customers. But he also sold locally and often with the cases, Sinclair then pleaded guilty to possessing Class A drugs with intent to supply; Importing a Class A drug; and being involved in the supply of Class A, B and C drugs. Hall also used his Chamberlain Street home to run a similar darknet drug network. He similarly pleaded guilty to possessing Class A, B and C drugs with intent to supply, and attempted supply of Class A drugs. Additionally, he was charged with possessing criminal property. The Sinclair raid: In August 2016, police searched Sinclairs home. According to Prosecution lawyer Philip Henry, Sinclair was destroying evidence during the search. Displayed on the computer screen was a list. And it showed details of hundreds of drugs transactions, the lawyer said. Investigators found five sealed packages in the house. He previously addressed the packages and prepared them for shipment. Three packages contained DVDs full of MDMA. These packages had the addresses of Sinclairs main clients. But the other two packages were Kyle Halls. And they contained more than $1,500 each. The prosecutor claimed that the money payment for drug shipments. Police also found 70 grams of MDMA, 310 LSD blotters, and a box with 6,0.00. Police also found DVD cases, brown cardboard envelopes, and a vacuum sealing device. Anyone looking at it would think it was a professional business, the lawyer said. Additionally, PSNIs Cyber Crime unit found emails on Sinclairs computeremails sent to customers. He signed the emails with his darknet pseudonym S&amp;G which stood for Smash and Grab, according to the court. It is clear from the Cyber Crime Units report that Sinclairs customer base extended across Scotland, England and throughout Northern Ireland. This was a professionally run online based drug distribution business, explained Mr Henry. The Hall Raid: Police then searched Halls house at the same time. They recovered a significant quantity of drugs, Mr Henry said. They found: * 1 kilogram of cannabis; * 1,000 ecstasy tablets; * 9,700 diazepam and clonazepam tablets; * 500 grams of crystal MDMA; * 1,100 morphine and oxycodone tablets; * 7,500 in cash; * Three electronic scales; * Cardboard envelopes; * Vacuum packing material; * Heat-seal bags and postage stamps; * And finally Package delivery notices and postal receipts; Police then estimated that the total street value of drugs found in Halls property was over 100,000. The Rodgers raid: District officers, later on, raided Rodgerss home at Glenvarlock Street. Law enforcement found a bank account in Rodgerss name. It then, after analysis, matched bank information found in Halls car. During interrogations, Rodgers admitted that he allowed Hall to use his bank account. He knew what Hall needed the account for. That, to polices knowledge, was the full extent of Rodgerss involvement. Mr Henry said: &gt; Sinclair and Hall were in a different sentencing category to Rodgers who was a patsy. Rodgers involvement was limited to allowing his address to be used for the delivery of drugs. And allowing his bank account to be used to deposit money. Judge Miller QC then ordered the men to return to court on January 6, 2017 for sentencing. He finished and told them they were responsible for the scourge drugs present in society. "

I am someone who works in the head quarter of German internal federal police. it is known in deutschland as BKa. i studied law and joined the force because i loved my country and i always wanted to serve it and my citizens. after i spend more than 3 years with the unit i can say i am very dissapointed and i do not like what is happening. consider me a whislte blower but i am not. i am just sick and tired of seeing the german people money wasted and one of the reason i am doing this message is so simply because i can. since five months ago the minister Thomas de Maizire was too much interested in illegal internet activity and he was making meetings in the menistery on weekly basis to meet with department heads and talk about increased cyber crime in germany and in europe plus right wing crimes in deutschland and the extreme danger behind these two fields. he ordered to appoint 150 investigators to these two areas. around 1 and a half month from today minister Thomas met with someone called Holger Mnch (this guy is the head of bka in the germany). the meeting included all high ranking officials and cyber criminals was the main issue they talked about. after what happend in munich and the guy who shooted people the bka was under insane pressure from mrs.merkel to do their best and cooperate with all german agencies to stop these events before they happen. now let me tell you something about the german agencies. before all these events tha happend in this year the bka and a lot of other organisations were all short on money and the federal governemtn rarely accepted requests to increase their budget. they also dont have enough officers to deal with nazi events in germany and people who attack refugees homes. they had to spend their money on very specefic tasks and they had to spend it wisley. that is not the case any more today. menister Thomas and Holger they had been in contakt with frau merkel and they could secure huge increases in their budgets to fight crime. now that i am finished with my little intro let me move to the reason why i am here writing to you. Tomas and Holger had decided to increase kooperation and they made new unit especially to hunt darknet criminals. they have made list of prioreties like the follow - Waffen.Drogen und die sogennante Fraudsters. a new unit had been built and it compromises 250 investigatours. we had a team coming from Scotland and a team coming from the USA to join the operation. Thomas had made his best to get the americans to send us a group of experts from US postal inspection service and they sent us 5 of their best. the focus on germany-baseed vendors is very big because they are also a huge source for drugs that is shipped to america and germany is serving today as a big route to drugs from netherlands. the investigators are working day and night and very big number of german vendors are now under profiling. they are making plans to collect huge number of every's vendor customers and make them testify against this vendor in court. a word of advice to all of you out there, take action now before you are done. i have been in touch with people working on you and i can only tell you one thing. you will not get away unless you are very smart and know what you are doing. the intedted arrests will take place between 00:00 and 06:00 in most cases. they are following a very popular tactic among german police which is Die berrachungseffekt. do not be fooled by the big time windows- they are doing this on purpose. after working from inside for the last 3 months i could save the list of the most wanted by bka. i am only posting this list in this forum. i am not going to draw every vendors attention to this. if you read this topic and you can notify the names you will see below. please do the flowlling names are bieng profiled by the unit in Wiesbaden and the main involved Staatsanwaltschaft is the one located in Frankfurt am Main.

(there have been cases where we could recover information from harddisks even if they were formatted 3 times) ----- review every single person around you- there are informants working for the bka and informants have been the de fakto in many cases. your customers will may be zeugnisse against you. make sure your orders dont have sample of your hair or dna or fingerprints (you guys will be amazed if you know how many times we get real life biological evidences from vendors who leave them on their packages). if you cant stop selling take a look if you can move to another city and change the way you send packages ( for example change the postal cards you use- change stamps - chage envelopes colours - change shipping times - change used return addresses - send orders on two shipments ""for example send 2 gram of weed order by sending two letters each one is one gram, this way you will make it harder for you to be tracked) - change printing fonts - change times you log in and out off the markets - change your names on markets - in the first half of this year we made statestics again about darknet markets in germany and they think that underage people are buying hard drugs and psykedeliks now. vendors be warned of this- if you sell hard drugs to minors and get caught with evidence on this (the kid family might testify against you in court) you will be going down alot. one extra word to buyers and people who are buying - dont use tor with windows because you very easy to be exploited - use tails on a so called burner laptop and dont access interent from your home - use public and free wifi and if possible dont ship drugs to your home addresses - the bka is given the privilleg to investigate the whole person's background and see if he is commiting another crimes once his name is with us. VERY VERY IMPORTANT - mix and tumble your coins - this way you will make it harder for police to proofe you're paid to something# one last word for vendors- be careful when you deal with market admins - many of these are working with poilce and are on the payroll of both sides.

28,cyber-crime,DarkNetMarkets,The Dark Webs Biggest Market Is Going to Stop Selling Guns,5,3cp39w,http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/3cp39w/the_dark_webs_biggest_market_is_going_to_stop/,2015-07-10 03:10:49,"URL The dark web is famous for making nearly anything available for sale. Now the trade in one of its most infamous commodities may be about to dry up. Agora, possibly the largest dark web market online at the moment, has decided to no longer allow lethal weapons to be sold on its digital shelves. Agora launched just after the first Silk Road was shut down back in late 2013, and has provided access to AK-47s, pistols, and other guns for over a year and a half. The only limits to its vendors is that they can't sell assassination services, weapons of mass destruction, child or violent pornography, poisons, or some certain types of stolen data. But in a few days time, on 15th July, lethal weapons will be added to that list as well, according to an announcement made on the site. Several dark web sites refuse to sell weapons as a matter of principle. Agora's change in heart is not due to any moral reasoning, however. Following our mission we wish such objects would be available for purchase, but the current reality of it is that the format of a market like ours does not constitute a good way to do it, the announcement read. Shipping weapons is hard, they are expensive, the owners add. Indeed, just recently a US resident was busted for selling weapons on Agora, even if he was caught because his fingerprints were left all over the weapon. The announcement also points out that those purchasing guns are often the victim of scams, with vendors disappearing with a customer's Bitcoin without delivering an item. On top of this, there has been a recent spike in the number of undercover operations carried out by law enforcement around the sale of weapons. For example, a six-month joint investigation between agencies in Australia and the United States first led to the arrest of a gun vendor on Agora, and then over a dozen buyers spread across the world were also caught. After taking over a vendor's account, law enforcement will typically make a series of controlled sales to whomever attempts to purchase guns from them. From here it is trivial to track down the customer, since they have naturally provided a postal address to receive the weapon. This is what happened to US resident Justin Moreira: he paid an undercover agent for a pistol with accompanying silencer for $2,500 in bitcoins, but federal agents were monitoring the postbox that the gun was delivered to. The FBI declined to provide comment about Agoras decision. A spokesperson from the UKs National Crime Agency said, ""Those seeking to provide or obtain illicit goods and services under cover of the dark web continue to discover that they can in fact be tracked and identified, and also that they are highly susceptible to being ripped off."" ""Law enforcement bodies around the world, including the NCA, continue working to prevent and disrupt serious cyber-enabled criminality,"" the spokesperson continued. Even with Agora pushing guns out of its portfolio, there are still spaces on the dark web to purchase weapons anonymously. One other dark web market, for example, currently has 83 listings for pistols, 17 for long-range rifles, and 26 for explosives. Of course, any number of those could be scams too, but regardless, it doesnt look like guns are going to disappear completely from the dark web for a while, if ever. "
29,cyber-crime,DarkNetMarkets,An alternative to DNM's!,1,37b1qc,http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/37b1qc/an_alternative_to_dnms/,2015-05-26 18:42:48,"In lieu of recent and earlier exit scams (eg. Evo, et), and the likelihood of the most popular DNM at the time becoming the focus of the FIB's, I mean FBI's cyber crime cronies, I'm proposing the idea of instead of risking your btc with DNM's that seem to be popping up like (poisoned?) mushrooms these days - all vendors need to have their own sites. This would potentially mean, instead of having fifty ebays where one could purchase their item of choice, with one or two ""big fish"" that are being hunted by the LE - there could be hundreds, even thousands of individual vendor sites. These could be all hosted and listed (with links) in alphabetical order under the names of the drugs/items they sell, or by their store name - on many darknet sites. PGP should be used in all transactions whereby a system could be put in place to ensure nobody disappears with btc. More importantly, tracking vendors and buyers by LE would become 1000 x more difficult!"
30,cyber-crime,DarkNetMarkets,The Force Briefing: LE DNM investigative methods &amp; resources,129,336p83,http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/336p83/the_force_briefing_le_dnm_investigative_methods/,2015-04-20 11:27:50,"The [recent filings in the Ulbricht case relating to the Force/Bridges corruption case](URL make for interesting reading, especially the DEA internal timeline detailing the infighting (and revealing 2 new CIs) and Ross Ulbricht's 'counterintel' file ([PDF of screenshots](URL [transcribed text version](URL The counterintel file turns out to contain Force's initial emails corresponding with Ulbricht, in exchange for the initial retainer of $5k or whatever in June-August 2013. While a bit rambling, the emails constitute a fairly thorough briefing on the progress up to then, investigative methods and level of monitoring of the DNMs, internal politics, motivations, and limitations of the investigations into SR1. Force reveals, among other things: 1. LE does actively compile lists of buyer addresses either from cooperating sellers or outright buying them; this strategy has not yielded many results though 2. a number of buyers have been so worried about threats to dox them on forums that they have run into the loving arms of LE 3. the investigations were largely sparked by Chuck Schumer's 2011 grandstanding, and were otherwise not a big priority 4. the DEA investigation was surprisingly poorly-funded, tech-illiterate, unmotivated, and juvenile; the FBI seems to be much more technologically sophisticated. 5. all the markets and forums are actively monitored/scraped, but by a very small team who can't go into much detail for each 6. a handful of the DoS attacks were done by the NCIJTF/FBI, testing SR1, but do not seem to have been attempts to use the known de-anonymization attacks 7. As of August 2013, the investigations had made almost no real progress in finding Ulbricht (and the timeline indicates they had wasted huge amounts of time on Mark Karpeles &amp; Athavale); it seems that Curtis Green and then Tarbell's mysterious de-anonymization of the Icelandic servers were huge breakthroughs 8. flipped vendors cannot, as a matter of DoJ policy, sell large quantities drugs for a long time; hence they will tend to go in a blaze of glory, start faking feedback, or quasi-retire with a low level of targeted undercover sales to attack specific buyers (especially gun and poison buyers) 9. Atlantis was (as probably is obvious by now) legitimate and not a honeypot. (I know, most of you don't even know what Atlantis is, but the old-timers will appreciate the closure.) 10. the domestic Bitcoin exchanges were fighting cooperating, MtGox was surprisingly safe, and Coinbase was actively rolling over to hand over user information (and PayPal but we knew that) 11. as long theorized, guns are *huge* red flag and single out a market for special attention and investigative effort; BMR was badly penetrated even in mid-2013, and despite all the BMR cases which have become public, Force's briefing indicates even more are still unknown The excerpts: &gt; Know that some of your vendors have been approached for (and have provided for money) buyer information (the idea is to purchase buyer information, which gets dumped and collated into excel). Vendors that get banned are approached via the email addresses they provide on their pages ""in the event SR is down, contact here.."". Just recently a New York based pill guy sold his entire customer list to what he thought was atlantis. Can find out his handle so you can poke around old private messages if need be. Several uses for databases of buyer information...Vendors HAVE been approached off-site (most list their tormails on their pages) for customer information. This has been bought. Then collected and dumped. It has mostly been vendors who have vanished/been banned/ or slowed down. They're deemed to be the most vulnerable. This is not pursued as much due to a poor ROI. Most vendors/former vendors have not entertained such advances and those who have have demanded funds that simply are not available even in the discretitionary account(s). Like any other government effort/agency/JTF, funds are near impossible to get approved &amp; released. Even undercover buys require paperwork and approval. There is no joint kitty of BTC available to make purchases from every vendor. It would take 2-3 days to get funds released for anything, and approvals are not that easy to obtain AFAIK. And in any case in this scenario, verifying information would be a nightmare. No guarantee that they would not just copy and paste names from the phonebook or use a name generating site. No real benefit other then to identify potential bulk buyers who would resell IRL (and this information would get kicked down to state/local). &gt; &gt; ...Am certain there are not many techies involved. Due to the unconventional nature of this network and technology, not much use for full time ""geeks"" being sourced &amp; assigned anything more then standard workload. Unless there's some specific technical question/explanation needed &gt; &gt; ...Again, something you would probably be able to verify - maybe half a year ago a guy from podunk Virginia contacted local and was crying about being blackmailed for his personal information by 'anonymous criminals' (Phil something). Middle aged guy who ran a travel agency. Even down to that level pops up on the radar nearby to where the birdie hangs out. Did not take long to assemble the backstory (small time recreational buyer just got blackmailed if you want to call it that by a crooked vendor) and dismiss as utterly irrelevant. I'm sure old private messages or communications can be examined to verify that instance. &gt; &gt; ...Prominent on the radar is Silk Road (amongst other known sites/actors on TOR) and since late 2011 there's been a lackluster yet interagency effort to monitor, disrupt, infiltrate and/or penetrate operations. The office of the DAAG (Deputy Assistant Attorney General) Computer Crime (at time Jason Weinstein) was the principal in spearheading. This is after Sen. Schumer &amp; party created a hoo-ha. Weinsteins office jumped to take charge and assume oversight. Under the auspices of the NCIJTF (National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force which is DOJ), the following fed agencies have a presence when it comes to SR (Stateside) &gt; &gt; 1) DEA &gt; 2) FBI &gt; 3) DHS &gt; 4) ICE &gt; 5) USPIS &gt; 6) ATF &gt; 7) CBP &gt; &gt; That should NOT worry you, because by ""presence"" I only mean their are active agents and officer level involvement from who's resources are pooled and budgets are shared. On a limb I'll say this, everything having to do with Silk Road (like any other open set of investigations) is on shared drives that almost all can read+write, and there is a shared public Outlook folder where all emails/correspondence pertaining to SR are routed. Everybody (and I mean everybody) from entry level up to the heavens have ""read"" access. Additionally, people talk a LOT. Loose lips is an understatement and the level of immaturity and juvenile attitude is staggering. There is no such thing as ""confidential"", and this is a culture where people are numb. You must understand that part of why I'm so confident (in my ability to maintain this relationship) is that nothing is treated as sacred and there are probably 100 people like me who could offer the same level of access. Analysts do collate data and prepare summarizations/status sheets and CC the requisite list/group.. and majority of the time nothing happens. Little to none replies/discussion. This is not SR specific, but does include SR. For example reports related to CP sites/forums or BMR often get the same treatment.. ambivalence. Here is something that will bring a smile to your face.. it is just not in the budgets to aggressively dedicate resources to SR. The way the budgets are allocated are almost certainly political in nature, and the lions share goes to War on Terrorism or ""real world"" drug activity. That's the cold hard truth. That's not to say that there are no zealots who do have a harden for SR related activity, but that is more focused on suspected real world trafficking. Ironically enough, guys at USPIS do not care in the least about SR. Yes you read that right. They're broke and have no concept of tech savvy.. and frankly, they are not interested. DEA guys often initiate most chatter having to do with SR, yet follow up is minimum and they are too bogged down in pending investigations of subjects whom they have the ability to surveil and/or who's circle they can infiltrate by way of CI's (conf informants).. none of which is possible when dealing with a beast that is virtually immune to real world surveillance. It's not a question of getting warrants to ISPs.. its a question of who/where to begin looking. They're stuck. &gt; &gt; At the analyst level, SR forums and the main site are crawled/monitored. Not more then 4 people are tasked with just crawling and mining the forums main site in an observational capacity. These 4 people are also tasked with crawling and mining many other websites and forums on TOR and clear net. So while everything is printed, you can guesstimate the scrutinity level is not extraordinary. That's not to say that others do not actively surf the forums and maintain both buyer and vendor accounts on the main site, they do. But at any given time, there are not more then a handful of people overseeing a crawl. When something deemed highly interesting or important pops up, they will CC the SR mailing list with a description and screenshot with their thoughts. Otherwise, there is a weekly status sheet that gets dumped with the most relevant/interesting/useful occurrences on the forum along with a summary on value/suggested ""action items"". Everything you post (along with the time stamps) is copied. You are referred to as DPR across the board. Often there is nothing interesting, and if there is there is it would be a bullet point such as ""Vendor XYZ (who deals in ABC..) said his packaging methods consist of 123"" etc. This is so they seem like they're doing their job as often there is nothing interesting at all taking place on the forum side. When moderators quote you, that is often the bulk of what gets bullet pointed ""DPR has instructed us to do such and such"". Now, there have and continue to be attempts to compromise staff accounts (on the forum and main side) by the normal methods of password guessing, but AFAIK none have been successful. There have been successful instances of cloning lookalike accounts which have all been shut down on your side. Of significant focus is attempts to impersonate you and your moderators on not only SR mainsite/forum, but on other TOR sites such as BMR or Atlantis to see if any prior correspondences can be restarted. Nothing there either. &gt; &gt; ...There HAVE been concentrated efforts to DoS/DdoS the site and forum to assess your response time and technical acumen. I'm not too savvy regarding this, but on a horizontal scope there have been/are attempts to run exit notes [exit nodes] and track traffic across TOR. To what end this has been aimed at SR would be something I would need to poke around about...6) Yes. I can poke around more, but in short - yes. What the end-goal was, I'm not sure. What they assessed, I'm not sure. But further attempts on the integrity of the site will be executed, be sure of that. Although I can tell you, that won't be a long term play. It can't be sustained forever...The DDoS would certainly be NCIJTF/FBI. &gt; &gt; ...The high-vol vendor operations such as (to just name a few) Nod, NorCalKing, RxKing are all under scrutiny. They've all been purchased from multiple times and general geographic location is assembled. For example it would be known that the Nod operation is NY, NCK is in California, RxK is Southwest US etc. There are also ongoing attempts to befriend the 'biggish' vendors through private message/forum pm/privnote/pgp and take correspondence off-site. This is where off-site deals and 'partnerships' would get cooked up and layers of anonymity be peeled away, leading to more detailed profiles. No high volume US vendor has been surveilled. On a state level, several suspected major vendors have been surveilled, yet none have been touched as that won't happen till a multi-jurisdiction plan to move on several vendors simultaneously in a grand slam display is logistically possible let alone greenlit. AFAIK, something of that magnitude would not be possible currently. There have been one-off prosecutions on county and state levels. What happens is that a vendor that has confidently profiled/ascertained to be originating packages out of a certain jurisdiction, that information is shared down to local/state to put eyeballs on. A lot of that was happening in the beginning, but now there's more of a ""hands off"" approach. They'd want to sweep the maximum amount of vendors at once. Having the Sheriff of Mayberry hit one based on JTF Intel is just not the culture/mindset. Nearly all efforts are conducted out of Jersey and Los Angeles. &gt; &gt; ...Posing as vendors - yes. That has happened. Although, DOJ attorneys will never ever allow drugs to 'walk' en masse. Especially after scandals such as Fast and Furious where the guns were allowed to walk.. they simply can not introduce narcotics into circulation. Vendor accounts have been bought to gain access to that side of the site and Vendor Roundtable and to establish longterm credibility, but any ""purchases"" would be absolutely fake and bought by their own accounts to build credible stats. Pm sure on state level there have been targeted vendor-posed operations to net bulk buyers, but those are highly controlled and short term. I have not heard of any of the top of my head. That does NOT mean that is not currently happening or will not happen in the future, but any significant bust would have made waves. &gt; &gt; ...One thing to be cognizant of, there's a lean on the domestic BTC exchanges to cooperate. There have been informal discussions in the last few months to develop working relationship with Coinbase (I know for a fact). After DHS hit Gox, even the boogeyman of a FinCEN violation is enough to mortify any of the btc guys. Anyone moving large sums of BTC will be open to scrutiny. I reference Coinbase because I know there was a series of meetings with Compliance at Coinbase. That can only mean one thing&amp; BUT, that does not mean that the full on arm twisting by Treasury is going to be utilized to track black market vendors. They're more concerned (and justify) their desire for access due to terrorism. Most of the black market economy is essentially low hanging fruit in comparison to terror funding. But if OC activity is disrupted and theres political mileage for DoJ, the wide dragnet serves a multi faceted purpose. &gt; &gt; 1) a) BMR is on the radar and that is ATF's baby. Politics plays a significant role in prioritization of which agency gets to own which investigations. The climate is aggressive when it comes to weapons trafficking and with the gun control hot potato has guaranteed virtually a carte blanche to ATF. And they have deep pockets as well. Because tor based weapons traffickers are almost always running guns IRL, there is synergy between federal and state. Federal approves staggering sums of money for surveillance,undercover and CI's. I don't want to say BMR is ""infiltrated"", but there are a lot of compromised accounts and there have been a few quiet busts. Nearly every bust has resulted in cooperation. I am not sure what the long play is, but as long as this current administration is in power the gunrunners will always be hard targets. They are intimidated with the threat of tangible charges (interstate trafficking, conspiracy, organized crime, distribution) and they ALL cooperate. The general consensus is that weapons dealers are not sophisticated and have a lot of IRL visibility, so they are ALWAYS on the radar. &gt; &gt; ...c) HackBB and TCF are prominent and actively surveilled. Have not heard of any significant operations that have netted any majors, but there have been some successful prosecutions/interagency wins. HackBB especially is monitored closely. There is another counterfeit site whose name escapes me now, but there was a major sting that happened in Boston last winter which was a result of efforts focused on it. Paypal was involved and was very accommodating to SS in handing over logs. &gt; &gt; ...8) Some, yes. Off the top of my head - I know that ""Costco"" is a West Coast operation and theres some fair certainty that it's an Asian gang deal. There is an immigration element and tied to IRL dealing. I'm not sure what the wait is, but there's some play that probably involves state/local. ""Marlostansfield"" is NYC, and the guy has a lengthy record and has been a CI in the past. ""Godofall"" is NYC and they're Dominicans who are street level/wholesalers. ""DaRuthless1"" has been surveilled by local in Queens and has a prior for distribution oxy. ""UndergroundSyndicate"" I know was assumed to have been made, but there was some snafu with that and bickering state level. I know there were a few California based pot guys who were being surveilled, I can circle back on vendor information. There is a vendor in Dade County, FL that was surveilled, grabbed and turned but the focus was on his IRL connects to coke wholesalers, not on mail. &gt; &gt; [Marlostanfield, Godofall, and DaRuthless1 seem to have disappeared before or during the fall of SR1 and no busts are known to be associated; UnderGroundSyndicate was busted as part of the SuperTrips case; the CA and FL mentions are too vague to judge. Ulbricht in his journal credits Force's info with saving at least one vendor, and it's noteworthy that someone contacted Eileen Ormsby in December 2013 (URL referring to Force's info and telling Ormsby to ""ask M___ how DPR knew stuff that helped him not get busted. He won't know how, but he will know what you are talking about""; Marlostanfield is the only vendor named in the entire file whose name begins with ""M"" and if he had already run afoul of the law many times, he would be quick to disappear upon being warned.] &gt; &gt; ...Now, when Gox was hit in the spring.. that was literally over an unchecked box on some form asking ""Are you a money transmitter?""! Because (the US subsidiary) of Gox failed to check the ""Yes"" box.. that alone was enough to get a judge to sign off on a warrant. The rest is history. LE has reached out to EVERY SINGLE DOMESTIC btc exchange and asked them to share records on vague grounds (ongoing narco-traffic investigations, Islamic charities/donations etc) and establish channels. The exchanges seem to talk to each other, and have by large put a united front and rebuffed these advances so far and have insisted their Ts are crossed and I's are dotted, which means they are not obligated to share records with any LEA on gratis. And since their paperwork is in order, LE is stuck here. They have not been enable to find cause to hit any of the other exchanges the way they hit Gox. I can tell you that LE is so used to banks bending over backwards to accommodate, they're annoyed that the exchanges have not rolled over. They have not seized servers of any domestic btc exchange. Even Mutum Sigillum's seizure was just their Dwolla account, not their servers or any stateside Gox data. Coinbase, however, is probably playing ball at some level. If you recall they scored like $5mil in a Series A round a few months ago. Few weeks after that (I'm talking June), there were meetings between there Compliance/attorneys and Treasury. This is not public knowledge. Either this was the investors insisting that they reach out to the feds and get in their good graces, or Treasury tried to squeeze them and maybe found something they thought they could use to bully them. But that's been quiet since. Have not heard anything. Gut says they probably reached some tentative agreement to pass on records in a limited capacity. Long story short, no, they are not tapped in to the exchanges (yet), aside from possibly Coinbase. ...About Gox: No way. Hitting Mutum Sig was a last resort and reactionary because they had approached Gox directly and were rebuffed, and then reached out to the Japanese government to no avail. Although on good relations, Japanese companies are very anal when it comes to perceived threats to their bottom line. Must not forget that Gox is fully aware that that a staggering amount of traffic is dirty money (no offense), and that makes them money. They can't fathom turning over records and data to the Americans without a crippling mass exodus of capital (if it ever came to light). Also Japanese are a proud people when it comes to their work. There are free trade agreements with Japan that have binding clauses to provide financial information to requests from say the IRS, but something that like can't be used as a tool with the Japanese government because of limited resources and approvals on our end. It's very beauracratic and not just a matter of a few phone calls and emails. And even still the Japanese can stall and pushback. As long as Gox is operating where they are, they will guard the integrity of their records/logs/data. Gox is outside the tentacles."

But: URL Could anyone guess the market in question? The vendor? LE couldn't be any more vague. Full Text: *A Manhattan man tried to buy the biological toxin ricin from an undercover agent posing as a drug vendor on an online black marketplace, U.S. authorities said in criminal charges unsealed on Tuesday.* *The man, Cheng Le, has been in federal custody since he was arrested on Dec. 23, and is set to appear in federal court on Friday, according to the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office.* *His lawyer Patrick Brackley said Le intends to plead not guilty. ""It's a complex case and we're working through the facts,"" he said.* *A grand jury indicted Le on one count of attempting to obtain a biological toxin and one count of using a false name in the furtherance of unlawful business, according to the court filings.* *The criminal complaint against Le said he used an unidentified black marketplace located within the ""dark web,"" a space on the Internet in which users' true identities remain hidden while they communicate. Le allegedly contacted an agent who had taken over an online identity that had been previously used by a trafficker in illicit materials and asked to buy several lethal doses of ricin, a highly potent toxin derived from castor oil plant seeds.* *""Do you have any recommendation for administering the dose?"" Le wrote to the agent, according to the complaint. ""Injection can be difficult to pull off. Ricin doesn't work immediately. You wouldn't expect the target not to fight back after being jabbed.""* *The complaint said Le wanted the agent to send the ricin to a shipping store near his apartment where he maintained a postal box. He appeared to have plans to resell the ricin to buyers looking for ways to commit murder without being detected, and later asked the agent to put the ricin into pill form: ""If you can make them into simple and easy death pills, they'd become bestsellers,"" he wrote, according to the complaint.* *U.S. authorities have been working to crack down on online marketplaces for drugs and other illegal materials. Over the past two years they have seized and shut down several such sites, including the black market bazaar Silk Road, whose alleged founder Ross Ulbricht is currently on trial in New York for related offenses. Authorities last year shut down a successor site, Silk Road 2.0, but other sites, including one called Evolution Marketplace, are still operation, according to the cyber watchdog group Digital Citizens Alliance.*"
