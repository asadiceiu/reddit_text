None of the currently hosted APKs were affected either.",3867,7iilqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/7iilqb/psa_apkmirrorcom_is_already_fully_protected/,2017-12-09 09:38:35,"We've moved quickly to protect APKMirror.com users from the ""Janus"" Android vulnerability disclosed by GuardSquare today. 1. URL is now fully patched against any such modified APKs. 2. All existing hosted APKs are safe, and we found 0 Janus-modified APKs. Screenshot of a Janus-modified APK upload attempt: URL Now for more info. Earlier today, GuardSquare published a disclosure about a serious bug in Android's APK verification that could allow attackers to tweak APKs without tripping signature verification. URL * See CVE-2017-13156 disclosed here URL * The AOSP fix is here: URL December 2017 patch level and above is protected, but everything earlier is vulnerable, so it was very important to make sure APKMirror.com does not allow such modified APKs. PoC (proof-of-concept) APK files if you want to play around with them: * Normal APK: URL * Janus-repacked APK: URL Special thanks to GuardSquare, Sander Bogaert, @VYSEa, and Eric Lafortune. **Tl;dr: @APKMirror is safe.**"
1,CVE-,Android,"Fixing the Toast hack attack (affects pre-Oreo Android versions, already fixed in Google patch on Tuesday)",35,6ysrmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/6ysrmm/fixing_the_toast_hack_attack_affects_preoreo/,2017-09-08 15:13:20,"References: - [Hack Brief: Patch Your Android Phone to Block an Evil 'Toast' Attack](URL &gt;The toast overly attack takes Cloak and Dagger one step further, the Palo Alto researchers say. They found that they could hijack the accessibility feature to perform a specific form of overlay using so-called toast notifications that pop up and fill the screen, with no need for the system alert permission. That tweak not only reduces the permissions that the user must be tricked into granting but also means the malware could be distributed from outside the Google Play store, where it wouldnt be subject to Googles security checks. &gt; &gt;When WIRED reached out to Google about the attack, a spokesperson declined to comment but **noted that Google released a patch for the problem Tuesday.** &gt; &gt;While Palo Alto calls its toast overlay method a high severity vulnerability, its not exactly cause for panic. Palo Alto notes that it has yet to see the attack used in the wild. - [Researchers Reveal New Toast Overlay Attack on Android Devices](URL - [Original group's blog post - includes video demo](URL **Summary of how it works:** Basically it is similar to Cloak &amp; Dagger, but instead uses a custom Toast message (thus does not require overlay permissions - EDIT: it turns out even overlay permissions are not required if app is delivered by Google Play - see comments below regarding SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission) on top of a grant-admin or grant-Accessibility-features system dialog - thus hiding that from user by making it seem like user is clicking on an innocuous dialog box. As the bleepingcomputer link above says: &gt;Instead of seeing an ""Activate"" button, attackers can use Toast messages to make the button say ""Continue,"" instead. &gt; &gt;Further, researchers say that an attacker can loop Toast messages to appear continuously, masking legitimate content for as long as it's necessary. &gt; &gt;""The Toast attack requires fewer explicit user steps to exploit and also can be exploited by apps that dont come from Google Play,"" Christopher Budd, Senior Manager of Cybersecurity and Threat Intelligence at Palo Alto Networks, told Bleeping Computer via email. ""Taken together these make this vulnerability more broadly viable for possible attacks."" &gt; &gt;Palo Alto says all versions of Android, except the latest (Android 8.0 Oreo), are vulnerable to Toast overlay attacks. &gt; &gt;The issue  tracked as **CVE-2017-0752**  was patched on Tuesday, when Google released the [September 2017 Android Security Bulletin](URL Android OS versions with the September 2017 security patch levels are safe against Toast overlay attacks. [A video of a Toast overlay attack](URL is available on Palo Alto's website."

3,CVE-,Android,The issue of security in LineageOS,1204,6g9imm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/6g9imm/the_issue_of_security_in_lineageos/,2017-06-10 02:31:52,"I think it's time we address an issue in the custom ROM community that is quickly growing in severity. ROMs such as LineageOS are often praised as a safe-haven for the privacy and security-conscious users. The unfortunate reality, however, is that LOS appears to be exposing you to an increasingly large attack surface. I'm not referencing the obvious and already thoroughly-debated risks of rooting your device and unlocking its bootloader. This is a bit more severe. LineageOS will often merge Google's monthly security patches into their ROM and quickly push these updates out to their users. This will update the security patch level in settings and give users a sense of security. **The disturbing truth is that very few of Google's security patches are actually being applied to the device**. In the case of LineageOS, it is the responsibility of the device maintainer to fix security holes. According to [LOS' CVE tracker](URL they don't always do a very good job. A few devices have a very high percentage of fixes applied. Others, however, have applied less than 20% of Android security patches to their builds. In other words, **while your device may be reporting that it has the latest security patches, you could still be vulnerable to dozens of security holes publically disclosed several years ago**. Some of which could be very severe RCEs and privilege escalations. LineageOS isn't trying to hide this issue, it's just not very well-publicized. In a recent blog post they state, ""If you didnt know, Google releases a set of security updates monthly, which fix a number of CVEs (security vulnerabilities). These arent always in the upper layers of Android, and are typically in the kernel. Because of this, it can be difficult to record exactly which devices, as a developer, have been patched against particular vulnerabilities."" I really think this issue needs more publicity. Users need to be aware of the fact that they may not be nearly as secure as they believe, and device maintainers need to understand the importance of patching these holes. Ordinarily I'd post this in r/LineageOS, but most of the posts over there are related to troubleshooting. This could be the case for other ROMs as well, I'm just only familiar with LOS. Edit: Fixed minor typos Edit: Noticed the LOS team is in the thread. Please know that I love what you guys do and don't mean to try and smear the reputation of the ROM. This is just too important and I feel like not many people are aware of this."
