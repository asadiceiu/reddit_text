They asked for my number and address while registering online. Okay, no problem. They'll be sending updates regarding the exams, results, etc so i thought there's no harm. Moreover it was mandatory to give so, as far as I remember. Fast forward to post CAT results, I've been spammed with countless MBA SMS and calls. One University even sent their prospectus to my address. I have never even heard about them and for sure never gave them my address. I contacted IIM, they asked me to email them the list of universities who are calling/spamming with relevant pictures. However when i was talking to the guy on the phone, he seemed to be a bit worried (scared?) when i mentioned about my data being leaked. A spam call who recently I talked to, and asked where did he get my number from, said blatantly that ""sir, sabka data aata hai market mein. Sabki percentile toh achi nahi hoti na? Har koi percentile ke through admission nahi le sakta"" (everyone's number is there in the market. Not everyone gets a good percentile. Not everyone can get admission through percentile) Amazing.

By this time I interrupted and saw the site and then googled it. It was obvious scam. He called them back and one time it was some dude in hard voice telling him to fuck off and then the lady called again. They asked him more money and then they cut him after argument. He got lot of info about them from the wallet and call. Phone numbers and accounts the money transferred from that wallet. He went to local police station they told him they cant do anything and it was on him being stupid. Is there any cybercrime police that can use that info and catch or trap them? Is there a place to write it in detail and all the post scammers info and phone numbers so it stays there like scacmmers crowd sourced db? They also have his info.

9,cybercrime,india,Farhan Akhtar on Hrithik and Kangna controversy,87,752znr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/752znr/farhan_akhtar_on_hrithik_and_kangna_controversy/,2017-10-09 04:18:12,"This is actually well written, so I thought would share: Today I read an open letter written by a man I know about a woman I know, professionally, at best. Although a controversy about them is going around since a while now, to my best knowledge this is the first time this man has expressed his point of view. I am not the authority on who is right or wrong in their situation, thats for the cybercrime officials to figure out, but I do feel certain aspects of the way the events have unfolded need comment. Like anyone who has an iota of objectivity and sense of fairness, I too agree that in our society, more often than not, it is the woman who suffers injustice and repression. It is horrifying but true that in some cases of rape, a section of society has blamed the victim. I have always found this to be unacceptable. 4 years ago, I founded MARD (Men Against Rape &amp; Discrimination) and through the initiative, I have been vocal in my fight against gender related violence and in highlighting cases of discrimination against women and the LGBTI community. Although it is true that in most cases it is a woman that has been wronged, there is a difference between most and all. However few and rare they may be, there have been cases where men have been stalked, harassed and falsely accused. This reality has been accepted by the highest courts of our land. It is in this spirit of objectivity and fairness that today I must speak up. The way this episode has played out with sections of our media is worrisome. Some of our most reputed journalists have, consciously or unconsciously, pushed one side of the narrative WITHOUT having or presenting any evidence to back the claims being made by the woman. Theyve accepted her story at face value. Isnt this discriminating against the other party? For a moment, lets put aside emotion, prejudice, biases, our understandably protective instincts and look at the facts as they exist today. She claims they had an affair lasting 7 years and during that period, they exchanged a number of emails. While he denies ever mailing her, he has filed an official complaint, shared and submitted all necessary information and documents, handed over his personal phone and laptop to the concerned authorities. The woman has not. Apparently, she has avoided, till date, submitting her personal communication devices citing some reason or the other. In some past cases, this lack of cooperation has been deemed to be obstruction of justice. Handing over her phone and computer is not only the right thing to do morally and legally but is also the best possible way for her to prove shes telling the truth. So why refuse or delay? Apparently, he has over a thousand emails from her official email account which are intimate and sexual in their content. She claims not to have written them but alleges that he hacked her account and mailed himself. If they were in a 7 year long mutually agreeable relationship, why would he need to do that? Does it not defy logic? Also, did he reply to any of her emails? As far as we know, No. Not one single time. Pause here and ask yourself.. If a woman was to receive these sort of emails from a man and she claimed harassment, what would your immediate reaction be? Would you have given the man the benefit of doubt by believing him if he said they were in a relationship and she had hacked into his computer and sent herself the mails..? Chances are you wouldnt. Theres more. She posted a picture of them together claiming it was taken during the years of their alleged affair. That picture was proved, beyond doubt, to have been manipulated. The actual image consisted of a group of friends including the mans wife (now ex-wife) standing together in a party. Why were the others intentionally cropped out? She has no messages and no photographs to prove that she was in a 7 year long relationship with this man. Not even a picture of their alleged engagement in Paris, an event which he denies. Furthermore, he has asserted that his passport does not bear any stamp of travel to France during the time she alleges the engagement occurred nor are there any credible witnesses to this event. Dont all these inconsistencies raise questions in your mind about the authenticity of the accusations? So what is the truth? Well, the truth is that WE do not know the truth. The reason I felt the need to say this is that it is apparent that some people have already jumped to conclusions while some are deriving some sort of voyeuristic pleasure by encouraging the woman to carry on speaking. This is being done without a seconds pause to consider the effect her words will have on the person, his family or his children. As great as all of it may be for TRP, its in terrible taste. Until such a time that the matter is brought to its logical conclusion by the authorities, we must avoid vilifying the man on the basis of unsubstantiated statements. That is what we would have done if this story had played the other way around. Thats what we must do given how it is now. Lets not discriminate."

(Note : Not in sequence as they appear in the article) &gt; They point to the apparent loss of five Army vehicles, due (according to the authorities) to a misfired mortar strike in the same zone, saying that a single mortar round would not have enough firepower to take out such a large number of vehicles. They add that the possibilities are that the damage may have been caused by a larger projectile guided by electronic systems that may have been interfered with during flight. &gt; The international analysts spoken to, who are based in Russia and the United States, two of the four giants in the cyber field (the others being Israel and China), point to the devastating effect of the lightning shutdown of the Northern Power Grid on two separate occasions in August 2012. These were attributed by authorities to an overdrawing of power by Uttar Pradesh, omitting to consider the fact that such excess power consumption is routine, and that in the past, UP had withdrawn far more electricity from the grid than had been the case when it tripped. They say that it is probable that a cyber-related malfunction of a key gauge may have occurred, leading to the breakdown in supplies. It is pertinent to recall (to illustrate cyber capabilities) that it was at that time that the US and Israel introduced Stuxnet into even non-internet related control systems in the nuclear industry in Iran. As a consequence, the nuclear process gauges showed acceptable speeds, even while remote commands raised the speed of certain processes to unsafe levels, thereby leading to a shutdown in operations. Of course, they add that it is next to impossible that either the US or Israel were behind the Northern Grid power outage, although both have the capability to inflict such damage on essential civilian infrastructure, and that the Stuxnet example was only given as an illustration of the lethality of cyber weaponry. &gt; authorities have adopted a conventional approach towards such crimes, as for illustration the overnight siphoning of Rs 1,200 crore ($171.2 million) from Union Bank of India on 20 July 2016 through seven swift transactions. $166 million was taken from Union Banks account in New York Citibank, while 5 million was removed from J.P. Morgan Chase, again in New York. The money was wired to seven accounts: Mrs Pornjit, SIAM Bank, Thailand; Mr Sithonno, Canadia Bank, Cambodia; Sactec Corporation, Sinopec Bank, Taiwan; Mr Cheng Nesgig, Indo-China Bank, Cambodia; and three other accounts. &gt; During the same period, Bank of Maharashtra is reported to have lost Rs 25 crore through fraud in their digital payments mechanism. Interestingly, the same year, a Bangladesh bank lost $89 million in the same manner as Union Bank of India. While the Bangladesh authorities visited Sri Lanka to bring the account holders (into which the cash had been transferred) to justice, thus far authorities in India do not appear to have been to the locations where the money was sent, to interview the recipients. In the Indian cases, authorities focused on backdoor diplomacy to try and get back some of the money stolen, rather than aggressively pursue the perpetrators and the beneficiaries. As a consequence, India is widely regarded globally as a soft target for cybercrime, despite harsh laws on the subject. &gt; they warn that the capabilities of Indian authorities in the cybercrime realm are of a Fourth World standard. They claim that only Open Source tools are used in this country to track depredators, including by locating IP addresses. However, such addresses can be easily disguised by experienced hackers, thereby leading to the wrong locations being blamed for a cyber attack. Hence, in case an attack comes from a particular country, it is close to impossible for Indian authorities to identify the source, which means that there is no way of knowing who to complain to and about whom. Unlike the US, Russia, Israel or China, where each has the capability to penetrate through such dodges and establish where exactly an attack originated from, India has thus far relied on outside police forces to deal with cybercrime in this country, many of which are in locations compromised by graft and connivance with criminal gangs.

She told me to send the photo of my aadhar card and qualification pics on her WhatsApp number. She further proceeded to tell me that I need to pay a registration fee of Rs 500 (bank account or paytm, any of these work). So I chose the Paytm option and was quite skeptical about this. I asked my uncle about this and he said go for it since usually one would scam an individual for more hefty amounts and also that deal was too good to miss. I paid 500 bucks on a number named as ""HR Call Center"" but I was foolish to not consider the options I had at my disposal soon enough. I installed Truecaller and found out the number is registered under the name Pooja Chopra (UP West, India). She further kept calling me regarding paying 900 bucks for the ""training notes"" and it would be refunded at the end of my training. I tried to contact Paytm about this and they responded that you need to talk it out with the receiver itself. Now what should I do ?

They blackmailed me that they have all the ""evidence"" that I instigated the strike that they were going to report me to the cybercrime divison, file an FIR and ruin my life. They asked me to write a letter saying that everything I wrote in my complaint to Anna University as false and I had no choice but to do that.

I cannot stress enough on the fact that you should never give out your Card information especially the CVV number and PIN number to any one over mail or on a call. Also when doing an online transaction - make sure it is a secure website (starting with URL and that you enable visa 3D secure or similar security features. But in cases where you receive such calls/mails, please report it to the bank authorities. I know people dont want to be bothered about complaining to the Police, as the chance of any action is absolutely zero. But unlike the Police, the Banks and especially organizations like RBI/VISA/Mastercard etc are very very serious about this kind of issues, as they loose millions of Rs/$ every year over card fraud. Following are some of the places you can report the stuff to: * VISA - phishing@visa.com / 000 117 866 765 9644 * Mastercard - stopit@mastercard.com / 1800-102-6263 * HDFC - fake.email@hdfcbank.com * ICICI - antiphishing@icicibank.com * SBI - report.phishing@sbi.co.in * Canara - reportphishing@canbank.co.in * BoB - barodaconnect@bankofbaroda.com * PNB - cybercrime@pnb.co.in Also check if there is a cyber crimes cell of the police force in your city. They will be more receptive of such complaints. EDIT: I forgot to mention - you will also find helpline/tollfree numbers for your bank behind your Credit/Debit card. Additional Info: While I certainly endorse the view of may of you - about using stricter security measures, encrypted apps, lower limits etc. - all this additional security is no cure for your stupidity. Stupidity is a harsh term, but most of us never really care about this kind of information till we have our own bad experience. Your banking information is a private information that you need to keep to yourselves (Information like the CVV, PIN, IPIN, OTP - even the bank employees do not have preview of). The more the number of people who know about your banking information - the higher your risk. Any failure in the bank's security system - you can get back your money. But if you give up information voluntary - then the bank cannot take responsibility for your loss - and you will end up loosing your ""Hard Earned Money"". Edit: htpps--&gt;https &amp; CCV--&gt;CVV"
