1,CVEs,removalbot,09-09 03:03 - 'Which distro has the best security team?' (self.linux) by /u/Hexawolfie removed from /r/linux within 0-10min,1,d1l65z,https://www.reddit.com/r/removalbot/comments/d1l65z/0909_0303_which_distro_has_the_best_security_team/,2019-09-09 13:03:34,"''' Hello, Linux community! There are plenty of Linux distros to choose from and it can make selecting a distribution quite confusing when the goal is security. Most of the people don't even realize the difference between ""security"", ""privacy"" and ""anonymity"" and Google isn't helpful with it's silly ""[15 Most Secure Linux Distros For Privacy And Security]^^1 "". Also people most of time don't want ""special"" players like Qubes OS or Tails (which cannot be even compared, you see), they want something different. Now, don't get me wrong. This is not an r/findmeadistro post, though it probably leads to selecting a proper distro for a reader. But this post is intended as an insight into the current state of the real Linux security. There were [multiple]^^2 [times]^^3 when patches introduced bugs and even vulnerabilities, and the most impactful ones I am aware of were introduced by distro maintainers (remember Meltdown mess?) At the same time, it's not just about security teams. It is also about distributions and has an ambiguous word ""best"" in it, which allows me to slightly modify the course of question: security is not just about patching vulnerabilities in time. It's also about picking right tools from the beginning, including TLSv1.3 (which is likely not yet available for Debian users), ECC (specifically, Ed25519 support in software), etc. And my question is intended to find out the most competent AND active community. This is a very complicated question, actually. For example, take a look at Arch Linux's [security page]^^4 which usually has lots of vulnerabilities opened because they rely on upstream directly. Then, take a look at a nice utility called [arch-audit]^^5 . And then read about [malware in AUR]^^6 . I also believe there was a story about Arch getting security fixes faster than Ubuntu. And then think about how fine-grained control over your OS can help security. Let's clarify some things and recap: * By security I safety from unauthorized data access and identity stealing, not ""anonymity"" or ""privacy"" - two words that almost became trademarks because of incompetent ""TOP 10"" approach. * A person who responds to this post must be aware that some CVEs are not exploitable by themselves, as well as the well-known fact that correlation does not mean causation, i.e. ""bigger userbase"" or ""Canonical-backed"" does not mean that a distro has a better security team. Look at [Linux Mint]^^7 , I [dare]^^8 you! * By ""best"" I mean ""providing security patches fast enough with sufficient code quality"" and ""providing **actually** safe defaults"". Cheers!

I don't know what your area of expertise is that you know what systemD and SysV Init are but would make such a claim-- but it's terribly ill informed. [Here]^^1 is a bug from this year in sysv init; despite being relatively simple and older than time, it still hasnt shaken out all of its bugs. And it's worth noting that sysv init is one of the simpler examples of a program, with a very small, well defined, unchanging tasks; what you're describing is massively more complex. &gt;but we can really, really get them down to virtually nothing with good design. Sounds like you need to show Microsoft, Apple, and Google how it's done. All three have taken multiple stabs at OSes and pseudo-oses (browsers) with various levels of restrictions, and new CVEs come out for them monthly. There is a huge gap between theoretical good design and what happens when you try to implement it on real hardware. Even if you get the software right, your vision is too narrow if you think you've won. Now you have to worry about: * Implementation sidechannels * Driver bugs * Firmware bugs * Hardware bugs and attacks (Spectre / Meltdown, cosmic ray bit flips, hardware sidechannels) * Supply chain security And issues in any one of these areas sinks the entire thing, because you're proposing taking humans out of the loop. That represents a massive power consolidation to whoever gains control of the system, which ***will*** happen. The NSA, the CIA, DoD-- all suffer breaches, and none have had the impact that a breach of your proposed system would. To be clear, my objection that ""we're not there yet"" isn't that we can't do global communications, it's that the state of AI is not to where you seem to think it is. AI is not capable of handling the relatively well-defined and well-understood task of automated driving yet, where we control the rules. We *don't* understand the task of ""controlling the economy"" well, which is one of the many reasons that command economies are inevitably terrible. And trying to build a computer program to handle a task that we don't even understand the rules for is a fools errand. But even if we solved the unsolveable problem of computer security, or writing a program that can't be written-- people will not sign onto a system where their wealth is controlled by a black box. If you force it on the people of one country, you'll run into the issue of people defecting for capitalist systems where they can strive for more. Systems like these try to pretend that human nature is other than it is, that greed and envy can be pressed out of people, but eventually have to cope with the fact that capitalism will still exist as a competing system. Mao tried to get rid of capitalism during the great leap forward, and it sprang up spontaneously as farmers traded their state-provided resources for other resources in a capitalist black market. You would get the same thing, and I rather suspect the only expedient solution would be the same as it has always been: liquidating those undermining the system. And all of a sudden, it sounds like we're back in an Orwell book.

However, there are some subtle differences which are not that good. These are the reasons why I prefer to keep anonymous. Before I present my reasons, I would like to present a few blog posts from several open source developers/users active in China (all posts are written in Chinese, and I might translate upon request if I can get the permission from original authors).  |   |  Deepin 2014   These posts all focused on the attitude that Deepin have towards their software. In my opinion, Deepin is much like Ubisoft and EA in some ways. They do have some very brilliant ideas, but they do not treat the quality of their software seriously. They also do not treat the issue of copyright/licensing seriously enough (just like the streaming plugin of their music player). First things first, they actually allowed something that is not allowed in any of the major Linux distributions, that is their desktop environment relies on a version of WebKit which contains many security vulnerabilities. They have used a modified WebKit 1.8.2 for nearly three years and as we know today, this version contains at least some of the following CVEs and they left them unpatched: - CVE-2013-2909 - CVE-2013-5195 - CVE-2013-0905 - CVE-2013-0902 - CVE-2012-5851 - CVE-2012-3650 - CVE-2012-3697 Their version of WebKit also will not compile on newer versions of GCC and requires dirty hacks to work which may potentially introduce more bugs and vulnerabilities to the package. Considering the fact that Deepin is actually backed by a commercial firm which want to compete in the Chinese (government) market with Red Hat, Novell, Canonical, and a few other Chinese firms, this kind of software quality is totally unacceptable. Even community distributions like Arch Linux and Gentoo will not tolerate this kind of security risk. This is also one of the few main reasons that the projects of porting it onto other Linux distributions have mostly being stopped or been dropped. For example, all the AUR packages related to Deepin have been orphaned or out-of-date, gentoo-zh overlay is purging the related packages from their repository in the next 7 days, and AnthonOS (a not-so-famous distribution, initially a student project) have announced that they will drop Deepin packages within the next few months (all these porting projects have once made Deepin ""proud""). Because the packages maintainers simply cannot continue maintaining the packages and introducing security hazards to end users. Another part reflecting their software QA is how they built their package. According to the maintainers of gentoo-zh overlay and opensuse-zh repository, the build scripts of Deepin packages invoked sudo directly. At least, doing this is very dangerous in some ways and can only be considered as a hack which should never appear in release versions or stable branches, but that was exactly what they did. Besides software quality, Deepin is also not a good player in terms of copyright/licensing. Around a year ago, Deepin got a special volume licenses from CrossOver which grants its users full license of CrossOver Linux. There is nothing wrong with this act as Deepin is a commercial firm after all. However, then Deepin started to packages some Chinese commercial Windows software (mainly freemium software) like QQ without permission from the original developers like Tencent. What is more, they reversed engineered these software and removed embedded advertisements and installable components similar to OpenCandy prior to their packaging. They even shipped CrossOver and these repackaged Windows software with their installation medium. Though these actions are severe violations of the EULAs of the Windows programs, they always claim that what they are doing is right and is a win-win for users, them, and software developers. Another severe violation of software EULA is that Deepin shipped Google Chrome as their default browser with their installation medium, which can be seen on the screenshots on Deepin. According to various sources, they did get permission from either Google or Adobe to do so, but they still redistributed Google Chrome and Adobe Flash Player in the name of ""conveniences for the end user"". On the other hand, Elementary show way more respect towards the rules and quality of their software. Though it is just a student project, they have been working very hard to polish their software before they claim it ""stable"". Though their code might be a long way away from the standards of Linus Torvalds, their code is already much cleaner than the ones of Deepin. Yes they may need a special version of GTK or Vala to compile, but their code at least does not rely on outdated software that puts users at risk, and they uses clean build scripts with no dirty hacks. Their code also compiles with almost no problem on the latest toolchain. Even Fedora is confident enough to include their Pantheon environment in version 22 as an alternative desktop environment. Though Elementary recently got lots of criticism because of Elementary OS: Why We Make You Type ""$0"", this in fact showed that they would rather rely on donations to keep the project running than doing some doubtful and questionable things that Deepin did to attract users and potential income. This made me respect them more than a commercial distribution which does nasty things and even claims to ""shame the ones who criticized them in two years with their own words (from Chinese social media Weibo)"". Deepin Linux was originally Hiweed Linux, a desktop oriented Linux distribution powered by a enthusiastic community which aims to ""Void the pain of the newbies and save time of the experts"" in a way much like Mandriva. It came out around the same time of other native Chinese distributions like MagicLinux but it became the only survivor of that era. However, now being run by a different group of people, it seems that Deepin has drifted away from its original objectives and became the ""betrayer"" of the FOSS community. Elementary, on the other hand, is more like a group of idealists creating a work of art, doing their best to create the perfect result. Though they have to ask for donations and follow an extremely schedule, they are doing a respectful and clean job and being respected by the FOSS community as innovators and artists. In my opinion, they are pretty much like the lines of this song: Pure Pure Heart (Song).

Its still moving the goalposts: &gt;Moving the goalposts is an informal fallacy in which evidence presented in response to a specific claim is dismissed and some other (often greater) evidence is demanded. That is, after an attempt has been made to score a goal, the goalposts are moved to exclude the attempt. You changed the criteria by which we were judging the number of carriers Britain had in a way that better supports your position. If you started with number of ships commissioned, then that is the benchmark we should continue to use. &gt;fleet carriers were not specified and is something you yourself acknowledged. Because thats a critical distinction you failed to make. &gt;Light carriers as well. Remember the 14 from your earlier post. Fair enough. &gt;Escort carriers don't apparently count remember? You must have replied before my edit. Nevertheless, now that I have time to actually check the numbers it was *Unicorn* and 17 CVEs ordered before February 1942, although 10 of these were ordered between December 1941 and the fall of Singapore. Since the Japanese offensives showed the value of carriers, even small ones, those three months you chose by citing Singapore are a bit disingenuous. Thats when the US carrier program took off (2 CVs, 3 CVLs, 14 CVEs ordered in the same period) and battleship production was suspended. &gt;The UK however had used carriers in both Taranto and the sinking of the Bismark before the fall. Carrier use against battleships had already been established and proved. That capability was still hotly debated with good arguments for both directions. For every success a carrier had over capital ships there was a failure and usually a reason that could be cited as to why aircraft were so successful that time. [I listed several examples here]^^1 . &gt;That we had ordered no more was a dockyard capacity issue, they were a bit busy after all. The RN just had to do with the Illustrious and Irreplaceable classes that were being built already. It doesnt help when *Lion* takes up a slipway for the entire war and *Vanguard* holds another for most of it. I dont know when *Temeraire* was scrapped (probably before May 1943) and havent done an analysis of British slipways in WWII as Ive started for the US, so Ill neither agree nor disagree with this statement for now. &gt;Showing the shift of concentration of what was important in the context of Taranto and of fleet utility to control the seas. Except citing 70 carriers doesnt actually support your claim as CVEs were never intended for sea control. At best you can argue 14 completed carriers were intended for that role, but for CVLs even thats a stretch. &gt;RN built more and commissioned more carriers than battleships in ww2 even accounting for ignoring the escort carriers Friedman notes that the nine US light carriers were a bit more effective than four *Essexes*. Applying a 2:1 ratio here, thats in effect 10 fleet carriers. However, counting the entire war is not prudent, as after December 1941 nobody rational argued the effectiveness of carriers. Before then, Britain only laid down six, very comparable to the eight battleships laid down in the same period (and ignoring the remaining four *Lions* not yet laid down in 1939). &gt;the RN had utilised them against battleships with Bismark and Taranto before 1942. Always in support of surface operations, either directly (*Bismarck*, Kebir) or indirectly (Taranto). &gt;maybe try and be in less of a rush to 'ackchyually' and read the context and post properly? Thats the pot calling the kettle black if ever Ive seen it.

And if you're going to argue the building route you forgot the keel laying of *Lion* and *Temeraire*. &gt;That they had decided the battleships omnipotence was over and had realised the strike ability of a carrier did not rely on the pacific theatre in 1942 or even the fall of Singapore. Before Singapore Britain had ordered no escort carriers or light carriers. This argument is flat out wrong. E: Correction, forgot about *Unicorn* and the first two or three CVEs. Still a tiny fraction. &gt;I didn't say they were. So why did you compare 70 carriers to the end of the viability of battleships? The only way that works is if you imply they were all equal in importance, otherwise you'd take a more careful approach. &gt;My post was making the point that as well as being the first to use carriers to strike battleships That's a very poor argument considering they were also the only carrier power in the war for two years. &gt;they were already committed to the use of carrier's in the fleet in WW2 and were not stuck in the battleship centric idea's of WW1 like the OP had implied.
