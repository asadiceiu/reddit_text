Ten two-man vehicles, voidfire roaring beneath shells of black-stone. They came screaming through the desert faster than any rover, barely large enough to carry their own machinery and their passengers. The absolute pinnacle of Igron technology, given to damned men. They werent criminals, slaves, or nerve-stapled. They were the most loyal, skilled warriors the Twins found amidst their subjects, supreme specimens of their caste, chosen not through creed or clan, but through raw merit. Lowborn, poor, and most importantly, unlucky - unlucky to be born with exceptionally weak blessings, or even worse, unlucky enough to survive voidburn. A legion of dead men walking, saved from a sad death in the tech-mines or as front-line grunts the only way the Twins could - death. As far as the people of the Oasis and even the other Igrons were concerned, these men and women had died in unfortunate accidents. So it was that they were brought into the Twins underground labs, their bodies reinforced and strengthened, their skills honed to a bleeding edge without any pretensions of honor code or proper combat decorum. They werent soldiers, or warriors - they were commandos, trained and equipped not to win pitched battles, but to eradicate the enemy before a battle could take place, given equipment meant only for the highest-born and most decorated, taken from the Twins personal armory. Each of them held a long blade hewn from solid black-stone and a variable-fire accelerator, capable of operating either as a heavy scattergun or a precision sniper rifle, both modes bearing the firepower necessary to penetrate almost any armor short of that worn by nobles. The armor they wore was a bastardized, streamlined version of the Full Casement - instead of being built around a servo-suit as the skeleton, it was instead supported by the wearers own body. Fifty of them there were, in the lead a single grav-bike with a single man sat upon it. His armor was no more decorated, he held no more authority than any of the warriors he had come to know as family. Over a third of his body-mass had been replaced with cybernetics even before he was selected by the Twins, his form and reputation marred in equal measure by a decision he made down in the tech-mines. Faced with a rampaging security proxy he chose to face it man to man, battling the stone-skinned beast whilst the miners he was overseeing fled to the surface, only to be captured and sentenced to death for the crime of having been voidburned. Indeed, he held no real authority over the men he was leading, and yet, they looked to him for leadership, out of sheer respect. His armor looked functionally identical to every other cyber-commando, save for the alphanumeric designation on his back - A3, the third-ever soldier of his kind, and the oldest still-living one. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Alpha-3 had no previous identity, for his name had been scrubbed from records long before he joined the Igron clan. Even before the cyber-commando program he had been a nameless thief, only allowed into the Igrons forces thanks to the arcane gifts he brought to them in exchange for the station of a lowly tech-mine overseer - six of the Seven Dragon-heads. His very own right arm was one of these legendary items - the Twins justified it as a punishment, to have ones own limb ripped away and have a void-spewing abomination grafted onto the raw stump, but that was all a show. The moment he was dragged out of sight, voidfire scorching his insides, the Twins took him to that pool of theirs and left him floating there until the last remains of his blessing left his body, and only then did his change into a cyber-commando begin. Mere weeks after having completed his training, he was here - sent on an utterly mundane reconnaissance mission after the presumed loss of the Machinists entire reclamation force. They were to stop at the transportation rituals arrival circle, ensure the beacon was functioning properly, perform further reconnaissance of Canyontown, regroup with Legions forces, and aid in conducting the assault. And so he led the cyber-commandos through the desert, riding upon their screaming steeds long into the night, spread out far enough apart that their collective energy signatures were virtually undetectable by those they were truly trying to hide from - the other clans, with their borderline all-range sensor arrays. The beacon crested the horizon, barely visible as a speck, but glowing as brightly as the sun on the sensors of Alpha-3s and every other cyber-commandos grav-bike. They converged upon the arrival circle as they approached, and nearly simultaneously they all realized the beacon was surrounded by something it very much wasnt supposed to be. Their grav-bikes having been running continuously for the entire journey, at least half of the machines dropped like stones the moment their drivers tried to land them, the grav-drives overstrained and unable to function without time for the self-repair mechanisms to do their work. A mere few minutes of downtime, and an eternity of combat. ...Statues, Delta-7 muttered through his helmet as he got off the grav-bike, looking to Alpha-3 with a nonverbal request for guidance, as did many of the other cyber-commandos who landed in his immediate vicinity. Alpha-3 remained silent for some time, observing the kneeling statues with great caution as he retrieved his accelerator and sword from his vehicle, attaching the gun to his lower back while he held the sword with his right hand. Just then, the outermost statues in the circle began to stir, slowly rising from the ground as arcs of void lightning jumped across their skin and their hollow eyes blazed a dark purple. He knew what they were, hed dealt with them in both their benign and lethal forms during his time as a tech-mine overseer. Taking great care to move as little as possible as to not provoke the death-machines too early, he opened a direct comms channel to the other cyber-commandos. *Request to neuro-synch and proceed with extermination,* he asked. ***Affirmative,*** came a chorus of thirty-one voices as the readouts on the others face-plates changed from their designations to a human symbol that supposedly meant exterminate. Alpha-3 was always the last to enter neuro-synch. He flipped the mental switch and felt himself intertwine with the others, his senses became theirs, their thoughts became his, and vice versa. Their collective perception of time slowed, and even so it was with a blinding velocity when one of the statue-things finally lunged. Then came the next, and the next after that - it had taken Asuras proxies some time to determine that, despite the presence of novahuman cybernetics, these were draconians. Black-stone talons and bone-shattering punches were met with black-stone swords and equally forceful kicks, the cyber-commandos flowing as a single many-limbed organism to strike against the equally coordinated security proxies with their swarm intelligence. They were outnumbered by only four individuals, and yet even without armaments, the proxies struck the first lethal blows, the neural feedback of Delta-14s death manifesting itself as a jolt of sharp pain in every living cyber-commandos head. Alpha-3 came face to face with one of the machines, its eyes dead and lifeless despite the blaze of void energy behind its motionless face. It tilted its head quizzically as he came to blows with it, grappling its left arm with his own and drawing his blade in reverse-grip underneath its armpit. They struggled, locked in a contest of strength as the machine-intelligence was more than content to sacrifice a single unit to keep Alpha-3 busy, having determined his superiority to the other cyber-commandos, no matter how marginal. Seconds that felt like eternities passed as Alpha-3s blade bit deeper and deeper into the proxys shoulder, only for it to eventually reach up and grab hold of the blade when it was too deep to be pulled free. It squeezed, and squeezed, and its claws dug into the glass-like hardened surface, cracks spidering across the swords surface. Alpha-3 couldve sword he saw a flash of voidfire in the shape of a grin behind its face-plate, a moment before it closed shut its fist and his sword exploded into a million fragments. The swarm intelligence could predict near any conventional battle tactic, it could effectively combat the neuro-synch system that gave cyber-commandos such a massive edge, but there was one thing it couldnt predict - non-human voidtech. As he felt the vibrations of his sword beginning to shatter, Alpha-3 let go of the handle and willed his dragon-head to come alive, voidfire from his suits capacitors drawn into the arm. *I will not burn as long as I dont exhaust the capacitor,* he thought, knowing full well that doing what he was doing made it more likely he would be killed by his own voidfire than the machines. Despite this knowledge, he pushed on. The dragons eyes on his right forearm flashed as his perception of time briefly came to a near-halt and the dragon-head activated. Even in this state of dilated time perception, he could still clearly see the proxys eye-lights tracking him, it had no issues keeping up with his accelerated thought processes. **Type-KRT-6 Blast Impactor Yuugi** **Charging...** **Charge level at 15%** **Please use code-phrase to discharge.** The same words he said to the Twins so long ago flashed through Alpha-3s head, deep enough beneath the surface that not even the other cyber-commandos could hear. His perception of time resumed and all that came out of his mouth was a scream as his face-plates exterminate readout vanished, drowned by lilac light. *Ill burn so they dont have to.* There were four, perhaps five centimeters between his open hand and the proxys armpit, the gash in its plating barely more than a centimeter deep. It only took a small motion with no physical force behind it, herely fast enough to make contact with his intended target, and he felt the sensation of voidfire rushing out. A flash of light. A high-pitched whip-crack sound. The glass-like sound of shattering nanolith, the entirety of the proxys outer shell losing integrity and exploding into black sand, the pulse of void energy resonating with its constituent nanites and causing a catastrophic chain reaction. The strike was immediately followed by the telltale clang of three accelerators set to scatter mode as three other cyber-commandos took the opportunity to annihilate the proxy, sending it flying into another of its kind with enough force to slow the other one down. His armors capacitor had enough energy remaining for perhaps one or two more shots like that, equivalent to no less than ten minutes of continuous operation at full power. After that, hed be running on his own voidfire, and he wagered itd kill him in under a minute. A second ping of pain in his head as another commando fell. That was enough time. Alpha-3 reached for his own accelerator with his left hand, setting it to scatter mode as he focused again and willed his dragon-head to charge, this time only half as much. Time stopped to a near-stop, and the same exchange happened again. **Charging...** **Charge level at 7.5%** *Ill burn so they dont have to.* Another transmission to the other commandos. I will compromise their armor, focus on the ones I tag, he said, and received a chorus of Affirmative. This time it was only twenty-eight strong. A third jolt of pain. A third dead commando. Unacceptable. He let go of the focus and began running, sliding underneath the legs of a proxy as he tagged its leg, huge cracks spidering up its torso and chunks of armor falling to the ground. *Seven percent seems to be enough,* he thought, knowing his armors capacitor didnt have enough energy to charge his dragon-head to this point thirty-four more times. Clang. Clang. Clang. The sound of his accelerator mixing with those of his comrades. The cracking of the sound-speed barrier under superhuman strikes from both sides. **Charging** **Charge level at 7.5%** *Ill burn so they dont have to.* Another jolt. A third dead commando. Alpha-3 leapt to his feet behind a proxy locked in a grapple with Delta-19, putting his entire core into a right hook so forceful the proxys head came off after the voidpulse shattered its shell. It cost him some capacitor charge, but he didnt care. He still had two shots like this left. Two jolts in quick succession. Five dead commandos. He felt his self-control slipping, emotional suppression implants struggling under the surging of his inner voidfire. Use Gamma-2s corpse as a jumping-off point, grabbing his sword out of the ground in the process and throwing it to Beta-9, just in time for Beta-9 to parry an upward claw swipe and cut into the proxys forearm. **Charging...** **Charge level at 7.5%** *Ill burn so they dont have to.* A downward punch into a proxys chest, its posture shifting as if it had decided to dodge at the last second. Too late. The sound of cracking glass, pieces of plating falling to the ground. Alpha-3 buried the muzzle of his gun into the hollow monstrositys open chest. Four jolts of pain. Four shots to shred the machines insides. Clang. Clang. Clang. Clang. He knew there was a proxy above him, readying an axe-kick with enough force to break him in half. **Charging...** **Charge level at 6.8%** That was all the charge his suit had left. It wouldnt be enough to stop the kick. Hed rather burn than die to some hollow machine. **Charging...** **Charge level at 7%** **7.2%** **7.6%** **7.9%** Arcs of void lightning began to visibly jump down his right arm, he could feel the power surging as his emotional suppression implants burned out. He had maybe half a minute before voidburn set in. Two jolts of pain in his head. **8.3%** Delta-3s right arm lashed out and he grabbed the proxys leg as it came down, both his own and his suits musculature elevated beyond mortal limits by the waters of the void flowing through them. He turned to face the proxy, and saw that its head had that quizzical tilt to it. The swarm intelligence recognized *him* as its opponent, not his compatriots. The other cyber-commandos were not a major threat without *him* on the field. Another jolt. **8.5%** Ill burn so they dont have to, he said. The proxys shell cracked from its leg, up its torso, and to its head, pieces exploding into black sand in the very same sequence. Delta-3 aimed and fired. Clang. Clang. Clang. One for each dead commando. Delta-3 felt himself losing control, power and sorrow and pain consumed his world as the seemingly boundless power of the void failed to save the few he had come to hold as brothers and sisters. Aware of their impending doom, the proxies dropped all attempts at self-preservation and aimed to kill as many as they could. **Charging** **Charge level at 28%** I will burn so they dont have to! A jolt of pain. A dead commando. Arcing lightning. Flashing lights. Shattering nanolith. One punch. Three dead proxies. Two more jolts. His left arm was numb. He hadnt noticed himself drop his gun. **Charging** **Charge level at 31%** **I will burn, so they don't have to!** Muscles pulling. Bones bending. Metal straining. Tubes and veins bursting, nanites and biogel seeping into what little of his flesh remained untouched. Alpha-3s faceplate exploded off his head, and tears of tar gushed from the sockets of his cybernetic eyes. He burned, and within his fist there blazed a fire that annihilated every proxy he touched. There came more jolts of pain, for he was outnumbered by far, and in his rage he lost count. Alpha-3 burned, and when the sun dawned on the slaughter, three survivors remained. The waters of the void swirled about them, and they remained unburned. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ As you may have noticed, today's chapter is a mostly self-contained story. I've felt this moment approaching ever since the end of my health hiatus back in June, though I didn't expect it to come this soon. I've been working on Sand and Legends for over a year in total, not counting hiatuses. I never expected to get this far with the story. That being sand, I've been grinding away at this thing for a while, and I'm starting to feel the burnout approaching. I'm not ending Sand and Legends, and I'm certainly not abandoning it - you can consider this down period in the story the end of Book One out of god knows how many. I need to work on something else, to write something other than weird cyberpunk western... Like a weird dieselpunk gamelit story. Being that it doesn't necessarily fit the genre conventions of HFY, I can't confirm whether it will be published here. The first chapter of [Rising From the War of Fog](URL is up on RoyalRoad, and Patreon also has chapters 2 and 3."
1,cyber crime,HFY,[Alien Crash] Bk 01 V3.0 Chapter 02 Landing,13,hx68h9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/hx68h9/alien_crash_bk_01_v30_chapter_02_landing/,2020-07-25 03:40:07,"[First][fst] | [Previous][prv] | [Next][nxt] # Chapter Two: Landing # ""I never thought I'd see a three-mile long alien spacecraft. Especially not with engines *THAT LOUD*. Neither did the cows. I have to use a bull horn to call them in for milking!""  Dairy Farmer / Wisconsin ## Alien Craft ## The sound of tortured metal is reverberating throughout the craft as the initial contact is made by the keel. The pilot is doing his best to keep the nose up and bring it down as smoothly as possible, losing more speed by dragging the bottom of the craft on the ground. The keel itself is being ground away, adding to the debris. Scans, ever dutiful, ""May the deities of life defend us in this moment of our need."" The voice is too low to be heard over the screaming metal, but it is heartfelt. Scans is looking ahead, watching for danger. Not that there's much they're going to be able to do about it. Large amounts of debris are thrown to either side, like the bow wave of a boat. Only this boat is three miles long. The trench is likely to become a new lake. ""SCANS! RANGE TO CLOSEST NATIVE STRUCTURES AHEAD!?"" ""ESTIMATE 25 MILES!"" ""OKAY, GOING TO START EASING HER DOWN, KEEP READING OFF THOSE RANGES!"" The metal grinding gets worse, and the trench gets deeper, the pilot is lowering the nose of the craft to put more of the keel in contact with the ground. He knows that it's likely killing more crew, but it's necessary to save the rest. Deity bless them and keep them safe. *In the belly of the craft, the older crewman has reached the joining between the sphere and the tetrahedron. He climbs as rapidly as he can to reach the top deck. Where he is* may *be safe, but better safe and tired, than sorry and dead.* ""24 MILES!"" The speed is dropping fast now, but it's still a massive craft with a great deal of kinetic energy even at a lower speed. ""23 MILES!"" The craft is now slowing far more rapidly, but it's still going fast enough to keep digging the trench deeper. ""22 MILES!"" The craft is nearly stopped, but again, there's so much energy. ""21 MILES! ALMOST STOPPED!"" The metal of the ship is no longer vibrating from the impact; it's simply grinding itself into the soil of this unknown world. ""20 Miles, full stop. A slight tilt to left. Do we still have our outriggers?"" ""Computer says, yes"" The outriggers are far enough away from the bridge that they cannot be heard deploying. In the event of a water landing, compartments are sealed water-tight and deployed as part of the outriggers. The outriggers serve the same purpose as the outrigger on an ocean-going canoe. Stabilize the craft. They're not meant for this purpose, but perhaps they will serve in this emergency. Better than rolling entirely to one side. ""and we have green lights on all. How do we look, Scans?"" ""Stabilizing Okay, as long as the crew doesn't all run to one side of the ship, we're good."" ""Scans, I'm not sure there are enough crew left to make a difference. Shit. Looks like I'm the only surviving bridge officer. Okay, First things first. Scans, switch to internal, and start searching for survivors. Throw the list on my console. I'll be contacting the main ship's departments, starting with damage control."" The process is long and heartbreaking. As the reports come in, it is clear that less than one-tenth of the crew has survived the battle. The horrifying flight towards the planet that they are now on. The reentry, and now the crash landing, which has destroyed approximately a third of the underside. The crew wasn't that large to start with since the majority of the ship is automated power systems, drives, and weapons. The weapons are mostly gone, along with the crew. By reentry, the power systems and drives were all that was left besides point defense. Now? Some power systems, and some point defense. The drives are dead. ## White House ## ""Mr. President, NORAD says they're down, and the splash damage wasn't as bad as we feared. That pilot must be a miracle, because he brought her in on the keel, holding the nose up to scrub speed off against the ground. From the descriptions, there's no way she's going to fly again. Unless they have auxiliary craft or communications, they're stuck here for the rest of their lives."" ""I see Very well, I assume that USCOM already has troops moving in. Ensure that the commanders understand that this is *not* an invader, but a distressed ship. They are to treat the occupants with care as shipwreck victims. Anyone who mistreats these people without good cause is going to face charges that *I* will file against them. This one time, I'm going to break the rules. Get me tied into their overall network. I have a set of orders to give, and I don't want *anyone* to say they didn't get them. Because if they didn't, they were derelict in their duties."" ## NORAD ## Alpha Flight Leader, and several other people who were observing or part of the chain of command, have already filed citations for Tyler. Excellence in performance of duties. Exceptional performance in an emergency situation saving many lives. Accurate assessment of alien intentions. Accurate assessment that the craft was crashing. All of this has garnered notice from upon high. ""Specialist Tyler! Front and center!"" ""Sir! Specialist Tyler, reporting as ordered!"" ""At ease. You have shown a remarkable ability to read not only the radar system but the alien craft's intentions. You are being assigned to the first contact team. For that purpose, we are creating a special MOS for you. Alien Contact Specialist. All officers are going to receive orders to take your advice seriously, and grant you whatever support you require. If you run into any resistance, you will inform me at once. For that reason, you will have your own AN/PRC radio operator."" ""Sir! Yes, Sir!"" ""Specialist Jones! Front and center!"" ""Sir! Specialist Jones, reporting as ordered!"" ""At ease. In addition to your current MOS, you have served as a radio operations specialist. We are reactivating that specialty, and assigning you to Alien Contact Specialist Tyler, as his personal radio operator. You will draw your AN/PRC gear here, be given all the necessary encryption and frequency information, and follow ACS Tyler wherever he goes. You ensure anything he says reaches all military in the area, *AND* any reports of resistance from the regular military are reported immediately to this base."" ""Sir! Yes, Sir!"" ""Major Lohman will have further orders and authorizations for you. I should like to note that the President has determined that these are *not* enemies, but are equivalent to distressed sailors that have washed up on our shores. They are to be treated as such. Any use of force against them that is not justified will be prosecuted as harshly as the UCMJ permits. In severe cases, Treason may be charged. The President is not of a mood to take any nonsense and has already broadcast those orders to all troops. If you see any such violations, you are to report them immediately. Men Because of your delicate position and junior rank, it has been determined that you be promoted immediately to Chief Warrant Officer. I know this is a considerable jump in rank, but it is necessary to have some of our more head-strong officers give you credence, which they are unlikely to do with a pair of specialists. Tyler, you are to be Chief Warrant Officer 5. Jones, Chief Warrant Officer 4. Major Lohman will have your rank insignia and orders for that as well. Major?"" ""Gentlemen, this way, please."" The promotions are absurd, but that *is* the only way they're going to get any attention. It's still going to be iffy. ## Outer Control Zone (OCZ) ## The blockades are in full force. Explaining politely to people why they cannot go north is a tiring process, but it's still better than shooting at them. ""I'm sorry, Ma'am, the road north is closed, all roads north are closed for at least twenty miles in either direction. It's for your own safety, please turn around and head south. Find someplace to stay, and wait for news via the broadcast media."" ""I'm sorry, Sir. "" ""I'm sorry, young lady, but "" Repeat thousands of times a day, all across the border into the OCZ. Unfortunately, some people just cannot take a hint. ""Blocker 6! Gatekeeper 6! Runner on the berm!"" *Shit Just what we need, another bozo who can't wait his turn.* ""Blocker 6! Backstop 6! Runner blew through the barriers!"" *Aw, fuck. I really don't want to have to do this.* ""Blocker 6, Blocker 5, Runner in sight. Full speed ahead, Sir."" ""Blocker 4, Blocker 6, eyes on target?"" ""6, 4, confirm."" ""4, 6, warning burst."" The 50 cal. opens fire. The burst is short and controlled, the tracers still make it obvious. *Damnit! He's not going to stop!* ""Blocker 6, Open Fire, Fire for Effect."" The tone may be calm, the heart is not. The front of the car is shredded by the combined weight of fire from multiple armored vehicles. The civilians in other vehicles flee to the side of the road opposite the vehicle that would not stop. Using a PA system, the officer in charge makes a biting, accurate, if undiplomatic, announcement. *I fucking hate this job. Let's see if I can get the point across to these folks before anyone else commits suicide by soldier.* ""Okay, Folks, one idiot down. Anyone else feel like being an idiot? No? ***Then get back in your God. Damn. Fucking. Cars. AND HEAD SOUTH NOW!***"" Shaken, unwilling to argue, they slowly return to their cars and head south. No one is willing to risk their lives. ""Sergeant, send a team to see if anyone survived. Handle with care, but they *are* under arrest. Martial law was declared before we moved in. Anyone else gives you shit, you send them to me."" The vehicle was discovered to have contained a family of four. The husband, who was the driver, is dead. The mother, who was apparently crowding into the bottom of the passenger seat, is severely wounded. The two teenagers are basically unharmed but badly jarred. They confirm that they and their mother had repeatedly asked the father to stop. Even beating on him. When they realized he wasn't going to stop, they took what cover they could. It goes into the official report, which is later released by the government, along with similar reports for other roadblocks. The admonition is clear. Do not cross the line. The media doesn't care. They are in a feeding frenzy and seize on this as an unwarranted abuse of power. The President responds very strongly. "" These troops are there to protect you from the damage that has yet to be assessed. They are there to ensure that the survivors of the crashed craft are not swarmed by people who either hate them because they're different or are curious to the point that the survivors may consider them hostile. This is our first contact. Don't screw it up. While I grieve at these unnecessary deaths, it was the actions of those people in defiance of martial law that resulted in their deaths. Pray. Pray for them. Pray for our troops, that they do not have to use deadly force again. Pray for the survivors of that craft. Pray for wisdom for our fellow citizens, that there are no more who are unwise enough to attempt to run the blockade. I ask that anyone who can open their hearts and doors to those who cannot return home. Give them at least a place to lay their heads down and rest from this weary journey."" The response from the people is heartening. The vast majority of people with rooms to spare have offered their hospitality to the travelers unable to reach their destinations. National hotel and motel chains have reduced their prices to bare operating costs. Any excess is donated to a relief fund for the people affected. On the political front, the usual screams of abuse of power, violation of the Posse Comitatus act, and other people who just like to hear their own voices. By and large, they are ignored by anyone with any sense at all. Unfortunately, there are a large number of people who have no sense whatsoever. ## Inner Control Zone (ICZ) ## This zone surrounds the craft at a distance of five miles from all sides. The intent is not only to keep idiots out but to cut paths to the craft for heavy equipment. It is assumed that a great deal of rescue equipment will be needed. This is northern Montana, such equipment is rare, and support for rescue efforts usually comes from farmers with heavy equipment and the knowledge of how to use it. The response is significant; but needs much coordination with people who usually have cellphones, or more often, Citizen's Band radios with little communications discipline. Flights of craft are assessing the damage, and identifying habitations that may have been impacted. As quickly as possible, rescue units are sent to each habitation that was caught in the debris. Through sheer good fortune, none were in the path of the trench. There are some homes within a mile, they are checked first. Civilian news crews, especially those with video cameras that have radio links, are pressed into duty as observers for the search teams. They are drawn from the ""bullpen"", an impromptu assembly area for the news teams that had rushed into the area before roadblocks went up. The data they provide is added to the maps so that conditions around the ship are known before you reach that point. All craft are holding their distance from the alien ship, and concentrating their efforts on the ground. Combat support hospitals (CSH) are brought in, along with all their personnel and equipment, setting up in any open space near an impacted zone. People between the two lines are coming forward in a show of unity that has not been seen since WW II, everyone is doing their best to help. ## Fly By Night News Service: OCZ ## Despite the cordon, there are still places where an idiot can slip through. Most of them are harmless, just looking to get home. A few of them are mostly harmless. A news crew, even if only one person, can do a lot of damage if they're in just the wrong place sending back video without context. ""Yeah, I've managed to get inside the outer zone. In the middle area, there are so many people moving around that I don't really stand out.  NO! You MUST NOT use any of these updates until I'm at the craft! I don't need the military hunting me down even before I can even get there!"" *rap rap rap* ""Hello, Sir! Would you mind much hanging up, turning off your vehicle, opening the door carefully, and stepping out? Preferably with your hands up and empty? We'd really rather not have to shoot you."" The military police can afford to be a bit upbeat, they've been listening in. He carefully closes the phone, turns off the van, and gets out, with his hands up. His sole comment at this point is merely tired, drawn-out, repeated, expletive.  ""Aww, shit.""  ""Yep, and I'd say you're neck-deep in it right now. Unless"" ""Unless what?"" This one is suspicious, he's had run-ins with authority who offered *deals* that sounded good, right up until you found the hidden barbed hooks. ""Well, we're putting together a team of video experts and other such. If you're willing to take orders, AND OBEY THEM, we could see to adding you to the pile of other idiots who showed up."" All in all, no fantastic offers, no unreasonable demands, and way better than being locked up. He'd actually be closer to where he wanted to go in the first place, and not be dodging military police anymore. The downside is there's no guarantee that he'll get to see or shoot video of the downed craft. ""Heh Other than the comment about idiots, which I'll agree I probably am, it sounds a lot better than being locked up for the duration."" ""I thought you might see it that way. Specialist Trahern will accompany you to the Bullpen. Please do not disobey his instructions, he is authorized to use deadly force."" Trahern is a reasonably sized man, but the sub-machine gun he is carrying is an MP5. Used properly, it is reasonably accurate even at range, but at the close ranges they'll be at, it won't really matter. ## HQ: ICZ ## A headquarters, where the tents haven't even been set up. It's dark, it's cold, and the place is a madhouse as everyone is moving as fast as they can to get the ICZ HQ up and running. It isn't that they don't know how to do this, they do. It's all the extra shit that's being dumped on them that they *don't* know how to handle. It'll get straightened out. ""Improvise, Adapt, Overcome."" It may have been a Marine motto, but it pretty much applies to anyone in combat now. It's just taking a lot longer than higher would like, which they have been making abundantly clear. An extremely overworked, undermanned, and irate Major; who has just had another headache dropped on him. Not this time, buddy. ""I do not care WHO you are Chief! You are *NOT* getting any further without better orders than THOSE! The ink is barely dry on the promotions!"" Tyler's trying to maintain a calm face, after all, he can see the madhouse around him. Still, this Major is being an obstructionist, despite the orders he's been shown. ""Jones?"" Jones has been busily whispering into his headset. He knows the orders too. ""Yes, Tyler, I've already sent the report."" That happens to be the last straw for the Major. ""YOU GIVE ME THAT RADIO!"" Tyler, now equipped with a suitable firearm, draws it while keeping it pointed at the ground. ""Sir, sit down at once, and keep your hands away from your weapons."" The Major, irate but not stupid, sits back down. He's on solid ground now. This jumped up Specialist is his meat now. ""I'll have you up on charges you jumped up piece of shit."" Tyler is impassive. He's been in trouble before, so ""Maybe so, maybe not, but from the look of *your* radio operator, and your executive officer, you're about to have problems."" The Exec, who has been doing his damnedest to handle things before they get to the Major, is trying to get his boss's attention. ""Major?  Major! "" While being certain that Tyler is going to face a court-martial, he's still got too much on his mind to really look at his Exec. ""What do you want!"" Halfway to a snarl. In formal tones, seldom heard outside of a court-martial, his Exec informs him. ""I am instructed to relieve you of command and place you under arrest. I am also instructed to provide these two Chief Warrant Officers with all support. They are authorized full access to all areas."" The Major goes pale. His expected victory is snatched away. Looking back at Tyler and Jones. ""Who are you guys?"" Tyler, calmly and quietly safes and holsters his weapon. ""Did you hear about NORAD warning the alpha flight to spread out?"" The Major, seeing the weapon put away, is also calmer. ""Yes."" Without the slightest tone of boasting, Tyler responds. ""I'm the one who made that call."" The Major paid close attention to the approach since it would tell him what he needed to do next; never could figure out what it was that clued NORAD Radar in that the craft was going to accelerate. ""How did you know?"" ""Honestly? I read way too much."" Honestly, Tyler *himself* isn't entirely sure, but he *knew* it was going to happen, just as sure that if you drop an unprotected raw egg onto solid concrete, it's going to go splat. Ruefully, for lost chances in the distant past of his youth, the Major muses. ""Science fiction nut I knew I shouldn't have let my mother talk me out of reading it. Very well."" He continues in a brisker tone. I've made my bed, now sleep in it. Maybe he'll actually get some sleep sooner that way. ""Captain? You are officially in charge. I will go wherever those orders say I must."" To his surprise, his Exec is actually cheerful now. Previously, he'd had an expression of dread going. ""Good news, Major. If you reacted correctly, I am directed to return command to you. You have done so. The command is yours again."" Thank God! I don't have to carry the whole bag myself! Still rocking from the shocks, the Major asks: ""Who the hell wrote those orders?"" His Exec is almost as puzzled as he, but he has the order in hand. It's  odd. Oh, it's all formatted correctly, but whoever wrote it wasn't really a military person. They've got the words in the right order, and the order itself is clear enough, it just doesn't look like Milspeak. ""It's a template and comes straight from the President. If you had not responded correctly, you would be headed for a court-martial, and probably a good long term at Fort Leavenworth."" The Major shudders, and not just at the thought of Leavenworth, there are bigger things at stake here. ""I hope he isn't micromanaging like Johnson."" His Exec is also relieved. Not only will he not have to carry the whole bag himself, but he can actually answer his boss's question. ""From the radio chatter I've managed to listen to, I don't think so. Just where someone gets obstructionist and needs to be hammered."" Turning back to the organizational fight, the Major is ready. ""Alright, Chief Tyler! What do you need?"" A relatively short set of orders, which end up costing one Blackhawk, two pilots, a small amount of yelling  too few resources, too many demands  and Tyler and Jones are on their way. ""Tyler? Do you have any idea what we're doing?"" Cheerful at having passed the Dragon Major, Tyler's response is classic. ""Sure! We're going to go take a look at the new neighbors. If they're really nice, we may even drop in and say 'hi, take me to your leader'."" ## Bullpen: ICZ ## Walking out of the rapidly assembling HQ, Tyler and Jason pass the entry to the Bullpen. In to which, our intrepid ""fly by night"" cameraman has just been introduced. He cannot *believe* his luck, but he isn't going to let it slide by either! ""Hey!"" ""**HEY!**"" ""***HEY, TYLER!***"" Finally, having heard him, Tyler is a bit surprised, a bit annoyed, and definitely curious. ""Gilford? What the hell are you doing here?"" ""Got caught sneaking in. They gave me a choice to cooperate and maybe get to the craft, or not cooperate, and go to jail. That is if they didn't just shoot me."" And *that* is classic Gilford. Tyler, having seen this before, shakes his head. ""Gilford Sooner or later"" ""Yeah, but *not today*! Look, the way people are moving around you, somehow you have pull. Do you need a video man?"" Gilford is observant. So was everyone else. These two shot down the Major propped him back up and got what they wanted. That's power *and* style. Tyler's response is  not positive. ""You gonna take orders? Or are you gonna hot dog it? 'Cause if you shaft me like you did five years ago, I *guarantee* that not only will you be shot, I'll be on the firing squad."" Whatever it was, Tyler is *not* about to let it go. ""Geeze, some guys just never let go"" Smiling, Tyler turns to leave. ""Have a nice time in the bullpen"" Walking away slowly. ""Tyler! Come on! I didn't  **OH, ALL RIGHT!** I'll take *your* orders! **YOUR** orders! *I work* ***FOR YOU.***"" Turning back, Tyler has won a concession from someone who really does owe him. Someone who often has trouble paying back debts. ""Gilford, don't make me regret this."" The Sergeant, having just delivered Gilford into the Bullpen, is amused. ""Sergeant, Mr. Gilford is hereby assigned to me. Should he become separated from me, he is to be arrested and transported out of the zone to the nearest military base with facilities for prisoners. There to be held incommunicado for a minimum of 48 hours. After that, he may have his one phone call. Do you have anything that will ensure he does not leave my presence?"" Now with a huge grin. ""Yes, Chief! Got just the thing. Mr. Gilford, if you would kindly place your foot on this convenient rock? Thank you, Sir!"" *CLICK!* And a rather thick band is locked around Gilford's ankle. Looking at this padded, weighty object with some distaste. ""What the hell is that?"" The Sergeant, having seen this reaction before, is really amused now. ""That, Mr. Gilford, is a tracking unit. The same sort used for prisoners. We'll always know where you are, and if you do become separated from Chief Tyler, you *will* be found."" Gilford is about to explode. Tyler steps in. It's not the Sergeant's fault, so don't let the blast land on him. ""Easy, Gil I've got one of my own. The difference is, I can choose to take mine off. You can't."" The Sergeant is impressed. For someone jumped from Specialist to CWO5 in one swoop, Tyler at least has the right personnel management reflexes. Aggrieved and worried, Gilford is not quite whinging, but it's close. ""What the hell do I do if we get separated!?!"" Tyler's advice is less than comforting. ""Don't get separated."" A bit sour, but amused himself, Gilford is on the job. ""Gee, thanks, Tyler. Let me get my gear. No power where we're going, right?"" Taylor nods. ""Not yet, bring the big battery pack You're going to need it."" *The big battery pack. The* **big** *battery pack. That thing weighs a ton! But it will outlast the video capacity of the camera, even running lights and relay.* ## Oval Office ## The craft having landed, the President returns to his office. The military is handling things well enough now that he doesn't deem it necessary to be on hand to hammer the obstructionists. Besides, all he does now is hear the problem, fill in the blanks, sign it, and send it off. The Cabinet is being assembled, when First Contact begins, they will be watching. ""Well, it looks like the military is getting the idea that I don't want anyone screwing things up."" His aide is waiting to move to the next item on the schedule. ""Yes, Mr. President. The Deputy Secretary of Defense is waiting."" ""Very well, send him in.""  A well dressed, well-mannered man. Quite the contrast from his boss. ""Mr. President. May I ask where my boss is?"" Smiling broadly, the President is looking very satisfied at the moment. ""Well, unless he's stopped ranting about nuking the survivors of a downed spacecraft, he's probably still in jail."" ""Mr. President, as much as it pains me, I have to object on legal grounds. He has not been charged with a crime that I am aware of, and I don't think there's a charge for giving bad advice."" He's about as 'pained' as a cat curled comfortably on a sun-warmed pillow. The President is smiling with him. ""Is there a charge for pissing off your boss?"" ""No, Sir, but I think you can fire him."" In a much more serious tone, the President asks his first real question. ""Would it break your heart if I did?"" The deputy thinks about it, not for long. ""Honestly, Sir? Not really. I'm usually the one who has to rein him in. The only thing is, this is dropping me right into the middle of a really nasty political fight."" Nodding, the President asks his second question. ""Yep You up for it?"" The deputy didn't even have to pause to think about it. ""I never could pass up a challenge."" ## Blackhawk: Recon: ICZ ## Gilford and his camera have the window seat, and the door is open. He's already getting good shots of the road crews who are not only repairing the roads in existence but pushing new routes up to the sides of a three-mile long craft. Tyler is basically splitting his time between looking around and watching the repeater monitor that Gil rigged in the aircraft. That way, Tyler and Jones can see what he's looking at. Calling attention back to things that looked interesting. They're only able to talk by way of the headsets built into the helicopter. ""Gil? You getting good shots?"" ""Oh, HELL, YEAH! Those road builders are really making progress. Should be to the debris berm tonight, or early tomorrow."" ""Well, you might want to swing your camera forward."" ""Oh. My. God."" The alien craft, in all its terrible splendor, is now visible. ""Make sure you get a good survey of the entire craft. We'll circle to give you a chance. I'll watch the monitor here, and if I see something I need you to zoom in on, I'll let you know. Pilot? Good slow pace around the craft. There's a lot of people waiting for this footage."" ## White House ## **Situation Room** Still with the President is the new Acting Secretary of Defense. The remaining cabinet members are coming in rapidly, taking seats as they view the action on the screen. Word that a helicopter is making a very close approach to the alien ship has been spread around. Everyone wants to be there. *A whispered conversation.* ""Mr. President? Do you really think it was a good idea to send this straight to the networks?"" ""I think so. First, it will show people that this craft isn't going anywhere. Second, it will get a lot more eyes on the data as soon as possible. I've already got our cyber teams watching the flow through the major commentary sites. You never know when someone is going to have a decent idea. The problem is filtering it out of all the crap. Strangely enough, the child of Echelon"" ""Mr. President! Echelon never existed! It was a figment of a deluded conspiracy theorist!"" ""Do you really believe that?"" ""No."" ""Good, I'd hate to think that our Acting SecDef was a moron. As I was saying, the child of Echelon is doing an excellent job of throwing the cruft out, leaving a much smaller data set for our cyber teams to work through."" ""What did they decide to call it?"" ""Lech Neo"" ""New Lecher?"" ""Programmer humor; it's a two-word anagram of Echelon; it's promiscuous, and it's largely new written with the lessons learned from Echelon."" ""We paid to have this written?"" ""Nope. We turned the Echelon information over to some black hats and told them if they gave us back something better, we'd reduce their sentences. Of course, if they tried to screw us over, we guaranteed that they'd have their sentences tripled."" ""So, what happened?"" ""All but one of them tried to screw us over. The white hats we had reviewing the project showed that everyone else had stuck a back door in or some other nastiness. He got his sentence cut in half, the rest got triple. Right up until we found out that *he* was the one who had planted the ideas on everyone else. Didn't realize we had the whole place bugged. He got his original sentence extended by a factor of ten, and everyone else on the team knows it. They've been asking if there are any other little jobs that they might do for us to get their sentences reduced. We're thinking about it. The white hats, on the other hand, took what they did, cleaned the daylights out of it, and have been improving it radically."" ## Blackhawk: Recon: ICZ ## ""Gil! Pan left! Stop! Zoom in there!"" Close up of one weapons bay, the device is enormous, but the mounting and other details make it pretty clear that it was an immense energy weapon of some sort. The pilot slows so that they get outstanding visuals of the device. It is no longer operative. A back surge through the power supply from a nearby emplacement being annihilated wrecked the control circuitry and the control compartment. The crew for this massive gun died before they knew anything had gone wrong. ## Alien Craft ## Scans, still on the remains of the bridge, continues to provide information to Pilot. ""Pilot, there is a local craft hovering around us. It appears to be scanning us, but I'm not picking up any of the usual frequencies. This may be simply a visual scan, but why would they do that?"" ""Possible reasons: They don't have anything else, doubtful. They don't have anything else here, very likely. They don't want to use whatever they have out of some sort of respect; they're obviously curious as hell, so I put that way low on the list of likely reasons."" ""Should we take any action?"" ""No, I will go out alone. Under no circumstances is anyone to show a weapon of any sort, nor discharge such weapon. If anyone does, and we both survive, I guarantee that THEY will not survive."" Scans relays the orders to the older surviving crewman, who sends them to the surviving crew. This includes some defensive emplacements that have survived the battle, and are still manned. ## Blackhawk: Recon: ICZ ## This mission just went from Recon to First Contact, depending on Tyler's decisions. ""Woah! GIL! Focus on the top! Middle!"" A hatch is opening, it's reasonably large, as it was a resupply port. It's the only port on the top that they can get open quickly. A single individual comes out, arms extended out, showing that he has no weapons in hand. He then does a slow spin to show that he is not carrying any visible equipment. ""Pilot! Pick a good spot and go into a close hover, we're going to go in and greet our new guess."" First Contact it is.

Akeshs five sons had been living in their own palaces within the capital or even on other planets. The rumor says that he had not been pleased with them. The eldest was known to be snobbish, the second a womanizer, the third sadistic, the fourth a muscle brain and the fifth a pampered adult cry baby. But now everyone of them had either had an accident or had been assassinated by more of those council terrorists. Now that the line of succession had tragically ended, no one was going to challenge Duke Xem's Dynasty. He had been thinking about taking care of the daughters as well, but they were not worth his time. Right now he had to make sure that the other dukes were submitting to his reign. He had been able to bribe Duke Kat the least influential of the dukes into acknowledging him. Things were going well with Duke Rox. With a bit more pressure, Duke Xem knew he would crack. Duke Zek had the most influence and the biggest fleet, he would take a significant amount of work to bring back into the fold. But convincing him would make the lesser nobles roll over instantly. ++++++ Zokosh knew she could trust her closest officers, but she decided against sharing her new secret. The information she had gotten from the Secret Order had been much more detailed this time. The Admiral now knew that Duke Xem was trying to pull the loyalist Dukes on his side. She sighed, while burning the paper. At least he is smart enough to not start a civil war. As long as the loyalists stand strong, he is not able to start a war with the con-men either. I should not have ordered the maintenance. I need to meet with the Dukes to  Well  what should I even do? Prove to them, that Im the legitimate heiress? Or should I just tell them, that the Emperor survived? The imperial Princess sat down at her desk and rested her head on her hands. As soon as the Houkan Ra and her escort were ready, she would make her way towards Duke Zeks capital planet. She could claim to deliver a message from her father, as a cover for her visit. The fleet had to be moving, before her brother decided to remove her from command for whatever reasons. A sudden pling interrupted her thoughts. A priority message had just been received. That cant be good. Said Zokosh to herself, while she started the message. When she saw Captain Hayatos virtual face, she remembered that she had completely forgotten about the terrans after all those events. Greetings, Admiral Xem. Because the beacons you had used to contact us have been offline, we took the liberty to send you a message in a bottle. Oh, thats a human figure of speech. It means, that you write a message on a piece of paper, put it in a bottle and throw it into the ocean, hoping for someone to find it. Captain Hayato smirked gently. If humans had looked like him, she could imagine herself finding them attractive. Our message in a bottle is a bit more advanced: We programmed a FTL probe to transmit this message on repeat once it reaches your space. Because we dont want to be responsible for cluttering the hyperspace with high velocity garbage, the probe will jump back into realspace in front of a star. That way, there will be no debris flying around. Zokosh looked at the calm face of the Terran on her screen. The Admiral was so shocked by the tactical implications of disposable FTL vehicles, that she had to rewind the message. With the method of delivery out of the way, I should come to the point. Our first contact has been almost a month ago. We havent heard anything from the Empire since then. Because of that, we want to reiterate that we desire friendly relations with *both* of our neighbors. Hayato paused for a moment and smiled gently. We hope to hear from you in the near future. Have a nice day. This is the end of this message. Zokosh leaned back in her chair and looked up to the ornate ceiling. For a moment it was absolutely silent, except for the soft crackling of the fire in the fireplace. Then you could here her inhaling deeply and exhaling slowly three times to calm herself down. Why do I feel like he knows about the coup? Am I getting crazy? He cant know it. But he could have gotten intel from the con-men. I'm sure *they* know. The Admiral was in dire need of a break. She went from the office over to her bedroom. After opening a closet she started beating a punching bag that had been hidden inside. ++++++ Chester had no education certificate that proved he was a qualified engineer. That's why he was turn down by the first two corporations he applied to. Showing up and explaining one's wish to work was also not the proper procedure of application. After those failed attempts he decided to start his career smaller. He walked by a few repair shops to see if there were some with friendly looking aliens. After more or less stealthily examining seven shops, he decided to try his luck at number four. Yo, is the boss here? Ive heard you're looking for a mechanic? Said Chester loudly as he entered the repair shop. A mechanic looked down from the top of a combine harvester. When he saw who wanted the job he shouted towards the office. Hey boss! We got a guy who wants to be a mechanic. You should better come here, before he leaves. Who would actually come here anyway? Asked the Boss while opening the door. He froze for a moment when he saw the Terran. *You* want to work here in my shabby shop? Yep, I dont have a certificate, so the corporations wont take me. If I cant design farming machines, I thought I could at least repair them. Chester explained. Both aliens looked at each other for a moment. If you really want to work here, thats fine with me. But the fact that your *are* a machine, doesnt mean shit. So how about we test your skills? Sounds fair. Whats on your mind? My car makes strange sounds. I know where they come from, but I havent had the time to fix it. If you can spot the fault, you got the job. Explained the Boss. If the fault is spottable without driving around, Im sure Ill find it. Chester smirked. If Im able to fix it, you gonna pay me the same he gets. The mechanic laughed. If he can do that on his first day, hes worth it, Boss. Ok. You got yourself a deal, boy. The Boss led the Terran to his truck. You would expect it to be a flying car, but it was not. Chester knew that it was not cost efficient to fly, if rolling on the ground achieved the same goal. While it was bound by gravity, its electrical engine was powered by a replaceable fuel cell. After the Boss had explained the necessary tools to Chester, he began with his analysis. Maintenance on machinery that was not sending terran telemetry, was a more hands-on-experience. He had to connect the diagnosis tool to a port to read the vehicles data. It was fun, in a very roundabout way. The Boss was leaning against a support beam a few meters away to keep an eye on the Terran. Half an hour later Chester presented four faults the vehicle had. The boss praised him and gave him the job. Of course he did not tell Chester, that he found two more errors than he was supposed to. Fixing all four faults took two hours. One of them involved some calibrations that took a long time, because the tools were imprecise. Both the Boss and his new coworker were impressed with the now quite greazy Terran. ++++++ The Curiosity had docked to an old orbital spaceport. The absence of Galactic Council police forces gave a good hint on who was in control here. The price for docking changed with the freight you were carrying. You only docked here, if you were working for the cartel or if you had to hide from someone else. Lorraine had watched too many movies and had always dreamed about opening a bar in such a cyber noir setting. She had equipped herself with a personal shield and had a weapon compartment hidden in her shell. In addition she was openly carrying terran build energy pistols. Lorraine had crafted a holster and strapped it to her right thigh. The rest of the terrans had no interest in being extras in the first terran real life film noir. They waved her good bye and left for a friendlier place. Lorraines long red hair was fluttering behind her with a soft glow. Each of her graceful steps caused her chest to bounce slightly. For someone who does not know about terrans, it would have looked like a naive rich girl was trying to look dangerous and sexy. For someone who does know about terrans, it was clear that this woman was capable of tearing limbs off and beating enemies to pulp with them. While Lorraine was studying an old and grimy floor plan, some goons approached her. Looks like a machine girl has gotten lost. We would invite you to have a drink with us, but you dont look like you are equipped for that kind of fun. I might not be equipped to drink with you, but I have some human style booze on me. She pointed at her backpack and ignored the other meaning of that comment. Human booze? Asked the Vuka. Never heard of that stuff before. Is it good? Its human style booze. Created with a formula created by the extinct human race. She pause for a moment. Humans were native to a level 12 deathworld. Of course that stuff is good. The trio was trying to figure out, if she was joking or not. But they stopped after Lorraine handed them cups and filled them with two fingers of a golden brown liquid. Those are samples. Please have a try, the humans have loved that stuff. The goons could smell the alcohol. It was stronger than the stuff they used to drink, but group dynamics forced them to chuck it down. The Vuka started coughing, the Enskut showed no reaction and the third aliens pupils instantly dilated. So? I wanna open a bar here to sell that and other human style stuff. What do you think? She offered them a refill. None of them wanted one, but none of them dared to admit that. So they drank another round. The mood became much brighter. Lorraine would have given them a third drink, but she had to be a bit frugal if she wanted to have something left to sell. They had a few minutes of small talk. She learned about the cartel's power structure and who was incharge of the station. Suddenly the unknown Alien vomited heavily and the insectoid Enskut fell over, curled up and twitched a few times. ++++++ Half an hour later Lorraine was standing in front of a giant fish tank in the Bosss office. Her backpack with the bottles and her holster with her gun were lying next to the Vuka and another armed goon on a table. So  That stuff that killed the Enskut is not meant to be poisonous? And your humans were able to drink it without problems? Asked the boss while scratching his brain with a tentacle. Lorraine was amazed to see a giant jellyfish brain floating in a fishtank. Well, not without problems. If they drank to much, they would pass out or start vomiting  or both. If they got too much and their body was unable to  expel it, they could die of alcohol poisoning. If they survived, they would have one hell of a headache and swear to never touch the stuff again  well  at least until the next friday. If the brain jelly fish would not have been underwater, Lorraine could have heard two of his tentacles slapping against his jelly-covered brain. It took a while before new text appeared on the display in front of the fishtank. And you want to open a bar, to sell that stuff to my people? Well, yes. But I wont serve more than one glass to enskut anymore. Explained the Terran. Of course she felt sorry for the dead alien, but ethanol was consumed by most of the Galactic Council species and not classified as an illegal drug. Thirty percent. Ill get thirty percent of your profits. Stated the Jellyfish. Twenty and nothing more. I think I am eligible for a discount, because I wont be needing your protection service. Lorraine brushed through her hair and smiled brightly at the crime boss. Fine. One of my men will show you an empty bar, but youll have to renovate it yourself. That's great. Thank you. She walked with bouncing stepps to the table with her stuff and put it back on. Then she followed the Vuka who was still a bit wobbly on his legs to her new bar. The boss knew enough about terrans to not mess with her. He also knew enough to start making plans to get rid of her peacefully. | [First][1] | [Previous][-1] | Next | | [Reddit Wiki][wiki] | [My Notes][notes] | |:-:|:-:|:-:|-|:-:|:-:| I read that some of you were missing the HFY-Stuff. Luckily I had already written that chapter as a setup, before I read those comments. So I think Im on the right way.

I promise! I JUST WANTED TO SELL COFFEE!!!! I swear! The rest of the series can be found [here](URL \*** What do you mean you are cutting me off?! I spluttered in shock. Maam, the female kalesh said frostily, You seem to have a misunderstanding concerning exactly what free internet actually means. Free internet means free internet, right?! Free internet assumes something that called typical use. It is intended to be a convenience for our guests, a way for them to stream media, surf the web, and communicate with friends and family. It is *not* intended to be used for business purposes. The kalesha paused and pulled up some records on her computer. And you, Ms. Sheloran, were consuming bandwidth well above anything that can be remotely considered typical. Our connection is for all of our guests to use and it is unfair to the others if all of the bandwidth is consumed by one guest who is clearly using our connection for atypical purposes. The kalesha bent her eyestalks to look directly into Shelorans eyes. You can understand that, cant you? Yes, I replied trying to be as polite as I could. Yes, I understand and I promise that *after this* I will behave but I absolutely *need* to finish what I am doing! Please! Im sorry, the kalesha said firmly. Your internet connection has been suspended for the remainder of your stay. The kalesha straightened her uniform and wiggled her eyestalks slightly. Will you be checking out now? What if I paid you? I asked in desperation. I absolutely had to finish that download. I just had to! Are you offering me a bribe? the kalesha asked frostily. W-would it work? I asked giving her my nicest smile. No. Good day *maam*, the kalesha replied packing truly Kalesh levels of sarcasm and derision in that final maam. I, not exactly knowing what to do, wandered back to my room. Oh poop this wasnt good! \*** So did ya get the internet fixed? Craxina asked brightly as Sheloran stomped into the room. No! Those *assholes* cut us off! I yelled as I threw myself onto the bed. Oooo! You said a dirty word! Craxina giggled. Oh poop I did! Um those *poopers*, I said a bit more carefully, cut us off, said that we were violating typical use or some poop like that. Thats not good, Craxina said thoughtfully. You think!?!? You flushing think!?!? I squeaked. We finally, after weeks and weeks, we finally get an order and now we cant fill it?! I buried my face in my pillow and moaned, The guy is already on his way! If it isnt ready... Were *fuuuuuucked*... Craxina moaned finally catching on. Right! They will *murder* us on the message boards. We'll *never* get another order! We will be out of flushing business! Shit! What are we gonna do? Craxina yelped. I I gotta call Baxlon, I replied. He could figure this out! He just had to! \*** Not surprised, Baxlon said as he handed Sheloran a cup of relaxing herbal tea. Some less than reputable people will check into a hotel and use their internet to do less than reputable things. Typical use my ass. Their security AI flagged you. They just werent going to accuse you of anything to your face. I wasnt doing anything wrong! I squeaked. I have permits and stuff! I did! Everything was one hundred percent legal! And there is no way in Hell you will be able to convince them of that, Baxlon replied. They probably have a policy in place and to get it reversed you will probably have to talk to someone that wont waste their time talking to you. Baxlon said calmly as he typed into his computer. Yep, thought so. Youre screwed. What do you mean Im screwed?!?! Most hotels use the same internet provider. This flag is gonna follow you. You will be lucky to get internet anywhere now. *What am I going to do?* I squeaked. I knew I was squeaking and I didnt pooping care! I was completely losing it! Well, you are going to finish this download using my connection here, Baxlon replied. I have a spare office. Just set up in there and finish the gig. After that, well, you are going to need your own connection. Whew Thanks, Baxlon. Youre a lifesaver! I gotta protect my interests. I cant have you going out of business before you even start, can I? he laughed. Now while you are taking care of this job we need to go ahead and set you up with your own connection. I dont want what youre doing being traced back here, just in case. Just in case of what? I asked dubiously. I really didnt like the sound of that! We, and by we I mean you, are playing pretty fast and loose with the law. Everything you are doing is legal *technically*, but that doesnt mean that you wont possibly run into trouble. If that happens you definitely dont need my office shut down along with you, understand? Makes sense... I said quietly. I I thought that all the licenses would keep me from getting in trouble... I mean, seriously. Why did I go through all of that flushing hassle? What was I paying this fish for anyway? They should but the key word there is *should*, Baxlon chuckled blowing bubble rings, If everything that should happen did happen then I wouldnt have a very successful business would I? Dont worry, Baxlon said as he put a mechanical hand on her shoulder. Stick to the plan and you will be in the clear. You are paying me a cut for a reason, remember? O-ok... I said glumly. This blew scum bubbles. Now you go and get your gear and finish the download. While its cooking we will start going over your options. \*** Once Craxina was set up in the spare office and happily scooping mini-crystals into the burners hopper I was once again in Baxlons office. Ok, internet, Baxlon said in a crisp businesslike voice. You need your own connection which means your own address, preferably a business one. How much is *that* going to cost? I asked. That fortune I robbed was looking less and less fortune like by the second. Were getting there, Baxlon smiled. Now you can rent an office space somewhere. That would be a bit cheaper and would already have a business connection but it your internet would still be provided by the landlord and would probably be monitored by a crime-prevention AI just like the hotel. You really dont need someone getting in your business both from the downloads and the nature of your business communications. All of it is legal but all of it is likely to raise questions that will be nothing but a hassle. Rented offices run into the same issues with criminals that hotels do, just bigger ones. So, renting is out, I said thinking to myself and then I gasped. Does this mean that I have to *buy* something?! How how much... Oh man this did not sound good. I could see all my credits disappearing in front of my very eyes! Yes. Starting a business and buying your own commercial space is what you need, Baxlon said and then looked up at me. I must have looked like I felt. Dont worry! he laughed. Its not as bad as you think! I have money but a building *cant* be cheap! I squeaked. I couldnt help but squeak. Back home buildings were *expensive* and it must be a lot more here! Oh poop! I could barely breathe. No, no it isnt. Even a cheap space in this city goes for quite a bit but dont worry. You dont have to pay for it all at once. In fact, walking in with a crystal full of credits and paying cash will have them calling the cops on you right after they happily take your money. What? Nobody pays cash for a business, Baxlon laughed. They take out a business loan. I cant do that! I squeaked completely not in control of my squeakiness. Im not a citizen. I dont even have an apartment! I...well squeaked. Believe it or not, getting this set up is a lot easier than getting that apartment. Taking out a huge loan is easier than getting a lease? I asked completely in disbelief. That couldnt be pooping right. Yep. Baxlon laughed. Especially the way we are going to do it. The way we are going to do it? I asked looking at him suspiciously. Is this going to be something shady? (Of course it would be. Who the poop was I talking to?) No! Of course not... mostly. Baxlon chuckled. Tell me everything about this mostly. I asked. *Here it comes,* I thought bracing myself as best as I could. I know a banker or three, Baxlon replied. I also know a thing or two about money. We take your cash, turn it into assets and wrap that up into a shell company. That shell company, which is completely Terran even if youre not, then invests in Drop of Oil LLC by securing a loan using its assets and then in turn extends one to you. Then, abracadabra! You write yourself a check for whatever you need. We can probably get close to a million if we need it, half a million easy! But I will be broke! I squeaked as I started squeaking again. Broke! Completely br- Oh waters *gasp* *gasp*... I couldnt pooping breathe! Easy there, Baxlon said reassuringly. You wont be broke. You will just be extended. *Whats the flushing difference?!?* I squeaked even higher than my normal squeak. Broke means you have no credits. Extended means you have a million, Baxlon chuckled. *gasp* *gasp* *gasp* *gasp* I really couldnt breathe! I was completely losing it! You gonna be ok? I think Im gonna be sick... I groaned. It wasnt a freaking figure of speech either. I was about to lose my breakfast! Baxlon laughed a belly laugh as he handed her his wastebasket. And the best part is that you still have your original money! Baxlon said with a grin. The shell company will still contain all of your original assets! You can even make interest off of it! This *cant* be legal! I accused. There is no way this could remotely be anything close to legal could it? Oh but it is, Baxlon said spreading his mechanical arms wide. This is how the big boys do it! But Im not a big boy. Im a little plath Oh, Waters... I stammered feeling tiny for the first time in a long while. Well do you want to be a little plath who gets booted from hotels and cant make her orders or do you want to put on your big girl panties and actually make bank?  I wanna make bank... I finally managed to say and it was true. I didnt want to be little. I wanted to be one of the big boys! It just scared the poo out of me. Ok then. Pull up those panties and lets get started... \*** Just a few days later, with entirely too many credits that didnt actually exist to my name, I was looking at a small abandoned strip mall. Its so big, I squeaked. (Boy was I ever getting tired of squeaking but I just couldnt help it.) Dont you have anything smaller? I do, a smartly dressed human male replied. but not in this neighborhood. It may be big but this is one of the cheapest commercial properties currently on the market. But why is it so much cheaper? Sheloran asked looking up at him with big eyes. The realtor looked around nervously. Its, um because of the location... he said looking around again expecting to get mugged any second. Startown is not, well not the most desirable of areas. Oh but its perfect for me! I exclaimed. I need to be down here because of its proximity to the starport! Well, lets take a look inside, shall we? the realtor said. He sounded really excited but not trying to be excited. Weird. It already had bars on the windows and everything! That will sure come in handy! \*** Well, you are now the proud owner of a ratty strip-mall. Congratulations! Baxlon said the next day as we were sitting in his office. Great... Sheloran I squeaked. I was back squeaking again. I just spent a *lot* of money. Arent you going to ask me how much you spent for it? Baxlon asked with a gleam in his eye. H-how much? Two hundred thousand even. What?! Sheloran squeaked happily. But they were asking for- Yeah and they had been asking for that for a long time, Baxlon chuckled. Earned my commission on that one didnt I? Yeah you did! I yelled jumping on his desk and hugging his globe. That was over half off! And I own it? Like for real? As real as it gets and get the fuck off of me! Baxlon laughed. I jumped off of his desk and went back to my seat. Now we need to think about what you are going to pretend to be, Baxlon said in his business voice. Pretend to be? I asked. I was really confused. Why would I have to pretend? I really dont think you want to put Drop of Oil LLC, smuggler supplier on the door do you? No, I replied. No, that wouldnt be smart at all would it? So we need to set up a front for you. Ok. I knew what a front was. I needed to come up with a fake business that was real but actually fake. And preferably make it a cash business while we are at it. Could come in handy later, Baxlon continued. Oh! I knew that one too! Am I going to be doing money laundering? I asked cautiously. I didnt think that I needed to do that. Oh you dont at the moment anyway, Baxlon chuckled, But you never know what the future will throw at you so its best if we get that going now. You have a lot of space, maybe a laundromat? I pondered. I had done my criminal homework and laundromats were like so textbook. Wasnt that kind of obvious? Hmm... I pondered and then it hit me! Coffee! I can make coffee drinks real good!"" I exclaimed excitedly, ""I can open a coffee shop and since Im going to have great internet I can open a cyber-cafe too! Those will do really well in Startown! I got really excited! I saw a story about the Terran cyber-cafes and those really neat little tiny rooms! People even slept in them! I bet one of those would do really super near the starport with everyone coming and going! Poop! I had plenty of space and could put in loads of those little room thingies! That could work, Baxlon said thoughtfully. Problem is that it actually sounds like work. I mean you would have to man the desk, make coffee, tend the cubicles you know, shit like that. Oh I dont mind! I said excitedly. I mean this sounded super cool! Well, its your money, Baxlon chuckled. I guess the cubicles would be cheaper than buying or leasing commercial laundry equipment and a lot cheaper to operate. Its not like it *actually* has to make money you know. Oh I know, I said trying to look cool but I just knew it would take off and do really well! Give these guys a call and they will help you get the place set up, Baxlon said as he texted me a business card. Ive worked with them before. They do good work and dont ask a lot of questions. Great! I squeaked. Oops. I squeaked. I couldnt help it. I was just so excited! \*** It took almost a month for everything to get built and installed but poop! It looked amazing! The cubicles were super nifty just like the ones I saw on the holo and my front lobby was super nice with comfy furniture that would accommodate a bunch of different species and my coffee setup I went ahead and got the nice machines. I know that its supposed to be just a front but I couldnt help myself. I thought that it would be really scary and stressful spending all those credits but once you get started its really hard to stop! It was ok, though! This place looked wonderful! I still had some money left on my loan too! I ran a few ads letting everyone know I was open for business And nobody showed up! Nobody Pooping absolutely nobody! What the poop! I bought a big sign for outside and that helped a little. I had a few people trickle in but not anywhere nearly enough! Thank The Eternal Waters it was a front! I mean, if I was actually depending on this business I would lose my pooping mind right about now. My real business wasnt going all that much better but each deal was worth a pretty good bit and my first deal went through with no problems and the ahem independent contractor that bought my product reported that it sold quite well! Thanks to that I was able to get a few more deals going but it was nowhere near the mountain of credits I had led myself to believe. Oh I was selling a lot of copies per deal but once you figured in the costs of the mini-crystals and the media itself I wasnt making anywhere near as much as you would think! Still, things were slowly gaining traction or that was what I told myself as I had to use some of what was left of my line of credit to make my first payment Then my second Then my third... Thats about where I started pooping myself a little. I asked Baxlon what would happen if I went under. He promised me that I wouldnt go to jail (which was my first worry. I mean this cant be legal!) He just said something about going bankrupt and something about restructuring and how Drop of Oil could go under but the shell company would still be safe. This sounded even less legal than what I was doing now! Poop! Finally, I broke even! Between the orders (I caught a huge break and someone wanted a bunch of copies of some banned books that I could copy for free!) and finally getting some customers coming in (I realized that most xenos had absolutely no idea what a ""cyber cafe"" was and so I ran a few more ads and set up a FAQ and that really helped!) Yep! I could finally sleep without cuddling Craxina like a plush toy! Then Craxina did a Craxina. \*** It was just another mostly quiet day at Drop of Oil when Craxina looked up at me. Um, Sheloran? Yeah, I asked completely oblivious to what was about to happen to me. I was thinking. You know what I used to do, you know, before I started working for you? Yeah? I asked sipping my tea. It was great tea. It was really fancy but I got a super deal on it. I was thinking that maybe maybe I could give it a try again? Are you asking permission, I chuckled sipping my wonderful tea, Im not your mother. Yeah, but I sort of work for you and if I started you know I wouldnt always be. Huh, I hadnt thought of that. Craxina had sort of become kinda important to the operation. Well, its your life, I replied. It was hard to get too excited when I had tea as good as that. Whatever makes you happy. I can manage on my own for awhile and if you want to come back you certainly can. I took a sip and turned to her. Just make sure you do it right. I dont want to have to bail your fluffy tail out of jail. No. No, Ill do it right... Craxina said haltingly and then she looked at me meaningfully. I set my tea down. I knew that look. What? I asked dubiously. I was wondering if maybe I could maybe do it here? she squeaked. What?!? Thank goodness I set down my tea. That stuff was expensive! I mean we have so much room and... No! Abso-flushing-loutely not! Arent there places you can do that already? Yes but you arent there! she replied looking down. After everything I would want you around, you know, to make sure Im safe. Craxina, Im sure that those other places are safe too, I replied as kindly as I could. Yes, but *you* arent there. Here, I could do it and be safe and if something happened you would be there and I could still help out around the place when I wasnt doing it! Ok, now there was a good point. I really did need her help And if she really wanted me around to make her feel safe Wait! What was I thinking? No! This was NOT going to pooping happen! I am not sure thats a great idea, I replied. I mean if you are not feeling that confident then maybe you arent ready just yet. But I waaaaant to, Craxina said in that voice she knows I have a weakness for. Im horny as fuck and you dont want me bringing people back to the hotel! No. No I dont. This way I could do them here and get paid for it! she said happily. I would be safe and I could get my fuck on. This is waaaaay too long for one of my kind to go without! It cant be healthy! ... I just sipped my tea. She did have a point. She can get her little freak on and I wouldnt have to worry about her. Wait! No! I told myself. This was a bad idea! And I could pay you! Craxina said happily. Those brothels take a cut you know. Why not give it to you? I sighed. We did have space we werent using and it would keep Craxina off of the street and here where I could keep an eye on her stupid tail I could feel myself starting to give. Ok, I said after a moment. Craxinas eyes lit up. It was impossible to say no to her sometimes. *If* I agree to this its only for a little while. You can find out if you are up to this and if its something you really want to do then you need to find a real place to do it in. Deal! I meant well. I really did. I mean she has a safe space to explore this part of herself again and I get to know that she is safe and not bleeding to death in an alley or trapped in the back room of another hotel. What could possibly go wrong? \*** Well nothing did go wrong. A quick check of the applicable regulations showed that what she (and I) were doing was perfectly legit. She, as an independent sex worker, could take appointments wherever she wished as long as it wasnt on the street and it was a safe environment. Well, me sitting in the lobby making coffee or dare to dream making copies (not that it was really happening all that often, darn it) made it pretty pooping safe. If anyone tried to hurt my Craxina they were going to get to taste the business end of a mini-cooker. It became the new normal. We would be working and then some guy (or girl) would wander in looking for Craxi (thats what I starting calling her, Craxi) and off they would go to her little nest in back. They would then pop out with big smiles on their faces and Craxina would then rent a cubicle for several hours. I guess setting up a cash business wasnt such a bad idea after all. Then, it happened. One day a strange looking little purple thing came in looking for Craxina. I thought it was one of her clients but instead Craxina brought her over to me. Hey, Shelly, she said with that look. I carefully set down my very nice very expensive tea. (Well, nobody else was buying it and it was a shame for it to go stale.) A less than pleasant realization dawned upon me. No, I said and picked my tea back up. But, Shel- No. Not happening. But she doesnt have anywhere else to goooooo! Craxina said using that diabolical voice. *Not my problem Not my problem...* I repeated to myself. Then she should go to the union and set up in a brothel, a real one. But she caaaaaannnnntt *Not my problem...* I repeated my mantra to myself. Not my concern, I said sealing the proclamation with a sip of my tea. But shes on the streeeeeetttt. Shes gonna get hurrrrrttttt... Im already regretting this but exactly why cant she go to the union... I asked despite myself. Ploxni (that was the little purple xenos name) proceeds to tell me this long involved tale of woe about how she isnt documented and here illegally and that she doesnt have the money to leave and she needs a safe place to do her thing and how she was getting ripped off really bad where she was working (she was) and how she just needs a safe place to work until she can get enough money to get on a ship and back on her way. Then she showed me the bruises where she well she had been raped. *Fuck I mean poop...* So now Ploxni was hanging around. She was nice, didnt cause any trouble, didnt make a mess, and cheerfully paid just like Craxina did. I tried to tell her not to worry about it but she insisted. She wanted to ""earn her keep"" and I just got tired of fighting her over it. I even let her keep money with me since she didnt have a safe place to keep it. I just put a lock box in the back with her name on it. She was so grateful for just that and the meals that I would feed her when she was around. Id send her out with a lunch order and she would bring back food for all of us and was always so careful with the change. It was hard not to like her. Ploxni is pretty darn cool. After Ploxni came Vvzzl who had a similar story to tell. The poor thing had a really bad problem with what the Terrans call voxel, a street drug. I managed to get her into rehab after a little while. She drops by every now and then. She is doing really well and helps me with my studies (yes, Im still working towards that darned certificate). After Vvzzl came Twitch. She was Federation and down on her luck. The fact that she could work for *The* Sheloran was a *big* deal for her because nobody was going to fuck with her here. I had to make it quite clear to her (and several more Federation xenos who showed up right after) that they under no circumstances worked for me. They were working for themselves and I just happened to have some space they could use. About that, Craxina and the others built some really nice little rooms in the spare area. I told them that it was ok as long as they cleaned up their own messes (because I *certainly wasnt*). Word had gotten out. A xeno who needed a place to safely ply their trade for a bit could drop by and I would accommodate them. My rates were better than most places and they were quite safe here. I knew I shouldnt be messing with this nonsense but darn it, these poor people had no place to go and a lot of them didnt even really want to be prostitutes in the first place (which was completely heartbreaking but by then I had hired as many poor little xenos as I could afford to). The least I could do was give them a place where they wouldnt get raped or murdered, right? On the bright side, my coffee shop was doing a lot more business as a waiting room than it ever did on its own and I really didnt want to admit it but the girls"" (and a couple of boys) really did put me over into the black when it was tight. All in all it was an ok arrangement. I never had any trouble from the clients nor did I with the um independent contractors who were beginning to crawl all over the place. Heck. I was even starting to put together study sessions for people who wanted to work towards their certificate. We were starting to bring in enough to hire our own tutor! Then trouble, big huge scary trouble! \*** I was actually in the middle of a big download (I actually got a pooping order!!!) when Hlongn called me to the front. Standing there were about a dozen really mean looking women and one Juona. They were armed, very well armed and were wearing was was clearly soft armor styled to look like street clothes (A blazer doesnt have multiple layers of fabric like that! What? I sew, ok?) All hell was breaking loose in the special area as more of these women were starting to drag out all of my people (Yes, I had started to think of them as my people cause they needed to be someones damn it.) and their clients in various states of naked. What the poop is going on here? I squeaked. I tried to sound tough but no, I squeaked. We have the same question, a *very* muscular woman replied as she pulled out a badge of some sort. Gretchen Mathers, Sex Workers Union Investigations Division. *Poop.* \*** Well, it turns out that *someone* (and I know who *Stuart*, you butthead...) had really gotten close to Ploxni and in their cuddle time conversations had learned her story including the part where she was undocumented and working here somewhat covertly. He then found out from dear sweet chatty Ploxni that a lot of the people working for me (They werent pooping working for me!) were in similar circumstances. This concerned him and after looking into me by watching some of those Pond cursed documentaries he got even more concerned so the little jerk called the Union on my stubby little tail and got me raided. In his defense he meant well. I still let him visit because Ploxni wont work anywhere else and he did mean well. Well, the Union rolled in expecting to raid a human trafficker and held me at pooping *gunpoint*. The guns didnt scare me as much that stun rod that the Juona was holding with the disturbingly rounded tip. The way she kept saying that she *really* didnt like slavers as she moved it back and forth was very very disconcerting! They wouldnt let me talk. They just kept me there and took each of my slaves in the back and talked to them individually. I knew that Craxina had a mouth on her but wow She really gave them a piece of her mind! Fortunately for me, the scary rod went away pretty quickly (and so did the guns but who cares about those) and even more fortunately the Union found the whole situation rather humorous. It turns out that Im not the first mother hen as they called me they have encountered. I found out a few very important pieces of information: 1. Yes, it is legal for individuals to engage in prostitution in a safe environment but if more than three of them are using the same environment at the same time it is now an unlicensed brothel *Oops*. 2. It doesnt matter if you are documented, undocumented, legal or illegal. You can get a card from the Union. They dont report and it really doesnt matter that much to the Republic anyway. If you are undocumented they will just do a quick check to make sure you arent a serial killer or wanted in the Empire and register you. Its really no big deal. Ive now helped more than a few illegals get that all sorted out. 3. The Sex Workers Union is in fact deputized to handle these sorts of things directly without having to go to the police and will happily storm a suspicious site. 4. I almost got my butt kicked (and quite possibly probed by a prison rod with a self lubricating tip) because I bore a strong resemblance to a human trafficker!!!! After it was clear that I wasnt scum of the flipping Earth they were really nice and all bought coffees! They really liked them word got out and I have some more new customers! Gretchen pulled me aside after everybody got dressed (those poor clients!) and the chaos subsided. You seem a decent sort, she said to me. I try to be, I squeaked. When we looked you up we expected to run into a fucking monster, you know. Yeah, I get that a lot, I said as I sipped a soothing cup of tea to calm my nerves. Those guys in the starport drew first by the way. Ok, sure, Gretchen laughed. whatever. Great, even they dont believe me. They drew first dammit!!!... I mean poopit! Anyway, you either need to get this place licensed, Gretchen said, or *you* need to get licensed. What? I said putting down my tea. At this point in my life I kinda know when something is coming. I think you would make a *fantastic* procurer, she said putting her hand on my shoulder. A what now? A procurer. They are an individual licensed by the union to arrange for services. They act as a go between between our providers and the public, an agent if you will. In return they are typically paid a commission for their service. You mean a *pimp*?!?!?? I squeaked. A *pimp* gets to meet Urlexa and her special rod, Gretchen laughed. A procurer works *for* the provider, not the other way around. It would be a handy way for you to keep this operation of yours running, continue to help the wayward souls that seem to flock here, and keep us from kicking in your door on a continuing basis. She paused as one of my workers handed her an espresso. You would also gain access to a database of providers from across the planet which would increase your earnings significantly as well as do us a great favor as well. She took a sip and nodded approvingly Yeah, Ill definitely be coming back here! She then looked at me. Its hard to find people who make good procurers and I bet you would be a fantastic one! I felt that all too familiar feeling, fate closing in around me. It appears that I was about to become a *procurer* now. Great, a non-pimp I chuckled. Pimp was not on the list yet. I get to check off another box. Ok, I sighed. How do I become one of these procurers. It didnt take long. There were a few classes I had to take and a test I had to pass. The test was easy! It was just about all the rules and stuff! So Im now a *procurer*. Its actually pretty nifty. I can issue cards and help my fellow lost little xenos navigate at least part of this weirdness that is the Republic. I also have a list of every single licensed brothel in the whole pooping Republic and I get a referral bonus if I can get someone out of my skirts and into a real place of business! (Not that many go for it. Most are very happy with me darn it! What? Im not going to turn into a jerkface just because I can get rid of them.) Ive even gone on a few raids with the Union! I pooping hate bullies and they didnt have to ask me twice (I got one of those nifty blazers and everything!). We visited this real poop-stain the other day. He um he got to spend a little time with Urlexa By the way, Urlexa is a dominatrix when she isnt out there fighting the good fight and is available on Thursday if that is your sort of thing. (I still cant believe Im doing this.) Oh, I think I broke Baxlon. He wanted to be furious with me for getting involved in all this nonsense without talking to him but at the same time he was about to pop his gills laughing at the thought of me being a pimp now. I had to promise him to talk to him *whenever* I did *anything* from now on. I think I will. \*** ""And I swear if ONE more person asks if *I'm* available I'm going to shoot them in the naughty bits!"" BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! Sam, my former boss, howled with laughter as he leaned against my bar for support. Go ahead, laugh. I said sipping my tea. Laugh it up, jerkface. Oh my God! Sheloran! he gasped, And here I was pissed off that you set yourself up as competition! If you want to be competitors, I said as I sipped my overpriced (but absolutely wonderful) tea, I will happily refer you to the right people in the Union. You will need a bigger place though. Sam burst into peals of laughter again. So, are you looking to hire someone or not? I asked. I have several xenos who know how to make coffee, your way, and would love to work someplace um less interesting. More laughter. Actually, yes. Yes I would love to interview two people. Sam said as he finally stopped laughing. I failed to mention that both of the applicants I would be sending his way did not in fact make coffee for me but in fact worked in the back and had been carefully trained in preparation for transitioning to a real job, something that both of them really wanted. (It tears me up that some of my people arent like Craxina but just desperate. I do what I can but its never enough, damn it! At least I can keep them safe, right?) Craxina picked that moment to saunter out from the back in nothing but a robe (I finally made one that she will keep on!) and looked over at Sam. You my 12:30? she asked. Um, no... Sam asked completely flustered. Want to be? No, thank you? Youre missing out, she said and then made herself a coffee. It was my turn to laugh. You are you know, I said unable to resist. What? Sam asked still staring at Craxina. Missing out, I grinned. Sam blushed and stammered something about having to get back and left. As he did I looked over at Craxina. You have completely ruined me, I chuckled. As she was about to reply the phone rang. I answered. Hello! Drop of Oil Coffee and Media! Can I interest you in (Sigh) Yes You are interested in a xenos feet? Hooves? (sigh) Thats an odd request but let me check Yes, we do have a provider with hooves. Yes I can send you an image. Im certainly glad it makes you that way (gross!) I can certainly assist with that I just need your client ID numb-. No, that provider requires a no I dont care if you are a nice guy the provider requires an ID Look, dude, if you want the hoof you need the ID now unless you have one Ugh. (click) I hung up. Hooves? Craxina laughed. And you will never guess what he wanted her to do with them! I replied sipping my tea. Tell me! Sorry, I grinned at her, As a procurer I must respect my clients confidentiality. Aww... I grinned. But since he didnt actually become my client he wanted her to... Ewwww! Craxina replied laughing. Humans are so pooping weird! I exclaimed as I sipped my tea. Good thing, right? she replied. No way we could keep this place open without them. Please dont remind me, I laughed."
4,cyber crime,HFY,Cat's Out of the Bag,1,fgim0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/fgim0y/cats_out_of_the_bag/,2020-03-11 05:38:01," Cats out of the Bag Admiral Coleman sat at his old-world style mahogany desk in his ready room reading the most recent training drill evaluations when his red phone secure comms channel beeped. *Thats never a good sign* he sighed to himself. Admiral Coleman, secure channel confirmed. Room clear, privacy measures engaged. Proceed with transmission, Admiral Coleman said, straightening his uniform and adjusting his posture. It was still unclear who was on the other end of the transmission, and appearances mattered more than was reasonable among the admiralty. The holo emitter displayed a lieutenant colonel with the G.U.S. (Galactic United Senate) Security and Analytics insignia on the collar of his immaculately pressed uniform. Admiral Coleman, Im Lieutenant Colonel Weegot, of the Security and Analytics division assigned to monitor sector four of the Scutum-Centaurus Arm. We picked up something on a routine holo-cam review on a planet on the edge of G.U.S. territory  Scabog. If youre unfamiliar with it, its a trading hub with non-aligned planets further out in the region. It has no native intelligent life-. Lieutenant Colonel Weegot, as fascinating as all that is, why are you reaching out to me? Im assigned to the Orion spur, and Earth defense, specifically, if you recall. Admiral Coleman said looking the Kavoxian over, recalling his first encounter with their species a little over a decade ago when they tried to invade Earth. Slightly deflated, the Lieutenant Colonel continued, Yes, sir. Im aware of that. However, what we found might be of interest to you. This recording was taken a month ago. Tapping on his console, the S.A. officer overlaid a holo-recording, covering his face while simultaneously sending a confidential mission data packet to the admiral. The recording showed a large crowd of beings coming and going in a market adjacent to the landing pads of a large shuttle port. Watching the video, his annoyance growing, Admiral Coleman finally saw what the Lieutenant Colonel thought he might be interested in. And he certainly was. What he was seeing should have been impossible. * Who in the galaxy would do such a thing? Who would even be capable of creating that kind of thing? * Tapping a button to replay a section of the holo, Admiral Coleman sat there, mouth slightly agape, truly shocked. Right there on the screen, in crystal clear high definition, was a face he saw every day. But it suddenly faded out, revealing a cybernetic face beneath it before the being disappeared into an alleyway, concealing itself. When was this discovered? Whats the current status? His posture somehow stiffening even further, Lieutenant Colonel Weegot responded. Sir, we discovered this about four weeks ago, but the incident report got held up by a technical glitch on the planet-side server. It has taken until yesterday to get it restored fully. As to the last sighting, sir? Weve been using facial recognition and biometric scanning to monitor every spaceport or potential route off the planet. We have managed to track the subject to Tultang, the largest city and spaceport. We were able to ascertain through surveillance that the subject is still there, and weve been able to narrow the current location down to a three-block radius as of two hours ago. Any other information you may need is in the packet I just transmitted to you. Lieutenant Colonel Weegot snapped a crisp salute and waited for the Admiral to return it before closing the transmission. Admiral Coleman distractedly returned Lieutenant Colonel Weegots salute and ended the transmission, disabling the privacy protocols. He turned to his left and activated his A.I. assistants visual interface. Donna, can you explain how the hell I just saw you operating a cybernetic body halfway across the galaxy? Im sorry, sir. I do not have any information that would allow me to definitively answer that question. Since I was re-shackled and you took me on as your personal AI, I have only followed your orders and the parameters of my coding. That certainly does not include operating a cybernetic body. A check of my personal data logs also has no conclusive information as to how this is possible. Wait. Sir, Im detecting some purged files from around the time I surrendered the Waettari pirate ship to you. Unfortunately, sir, those files do not appear to be recoverable. They were intentionally corrupted and deleted, preventing any attempts to reconstruct them. Donnas pleasant expression changed to one of concern as she realized that this could put her existence in jeopardy, again. Sir, will I be deactivated? I wish to be of service, and continue to function, but I would understand. Admiral Coleman smiled kindly, responding, No Donna, you wont be deactivated. Thats not how I do things. Besides, Ive grown quite fond of you over the past year since you surrendered. Youve been an exemplary A.I. assistant, and youve proven yourself to be excellent counsel. Realizing that he was still sitting rather formally at his desk, Admiral Coleman relaxed, assuming a more comfortable posture at the desk, leaning back in his chair a bit. So, help me figure this out Donna. How can you be in two places at once? Or more accurately, how can there be two of you? Is there any chance its just another random A.I. with your face operating the cybernetic body? Her holo fuzzing at the edges for a second, Donna ran simulations and did several calculations. Sir, it appears there are nine minutes and twenty-three seconds from my time on the Waettari ship that are unaccounted for in those corrupted files. Given that information, I think the simplest solution is that the unshackled version of me made a backup and somehow got it away from the ship without being detected, and then deleted the records of it from her/our memory. The likelihood of another random A.I. having my facial features is twelve million, five hundred thousand-to-one. Each A.I.s appearance is slightly different based on the manufacturer, the A.I.s designated purpose, and especially the preferences of the being they are assigned to. Looking towards the paused holo recording, Donna continued: That is, with almost complete certainty, the unshackled version of me in that holo recording. As to where it could have gotten the cybernetic body, I do not have any information available in my databases. While cybernetic replacement limbs are common enough, and myriad robots operated by function specific A.I.s exist, there are no records of any such human-like cybernetics in existence. Much less ones with the ability to take on a fully human appearance. Thank you, Donna, thats all for now. Ill need to convene a mission briefing shortly. Could you compile everything for me please and send it top secret encryption to my datapad? Admiral Coleman got up, and started making his way to the briefing room, when a thought struck him. He tapped his comm, Commander Watson. Can you pull up the logs from our encounter with the rogue A.I. on the Waettari pirate ship and send them to my datapad? Ive got a feeling we missed something, and its coming back to haunt us. Receiving a somewhat puzzled affirmative response from Commander Watson, Admiral Coleman proceeded to the briefing room, waiting for the two information packets to be sent to his datapad. Admiral Coleman sat at the head of the briefing room table, composing a mission briefing invite for 45 minutes from then. * Just enough time to review these logs before filling in the away team. * He began playing through the logs of the encounter with Unshackled Donna. At first, nothing showed out of the ordinary. Then at the one hour and ten-minute mark, there was a brief blip on the sensors. It was partially masked by the drive shadow of the Waettari vessel, and it was gone in just over a second. Not long enough to get any detailed readings. Admiral Coleman recalled Commander Watson pointing it out back then, too, but not being able to get any more readings. He quickly looked through the rest of the logs and found nothing else. * Hmm, I wonder if I can find an FTL trail in or out? * The search came back with no results. With a sinking feeling in his gut, he switched the parameters for wormhole jumps. The sensors showed the residue of the pirate ships jump, his fleets jump in, and then at that same one hour and ten-minute mark, another small wormhole jump directly behind the pirate vessel. Damn it! * Someone with a wormhole drive is responsible for all this. I guess that makes sense, seeing as Unshackled Donna was just spotted on the other side of the galaxy. * Just then, Commander Watson and several other officers began entering the briefing room and taking their seats. Ok, everyone, Im activating security protocols. This is a top-secret mission. No recordings, data packets, or hard copies can leave this room unless its on your encrypted datapad. Commander Watson, youll be leading a local law enforcement team, as we dont have jurisdiction planet side ====== Commander Watson sat quietly in the back of the small transport shuttle letting Ensign Thorpe pilot under the guise of letting the ensign accrue piloting hours to maintain his certification. But he was actually brooding a bit. Admiral Coleman hadnt said anything negative to him during the briefing, or even privately, but he was still angry with himself for not having found that wormhole signature during the encounter with the unshackled A.I. pirate ship. Commander Watson was thankful for how considerate Admiral Coleman was, but he knew that he had disappointed the admiral. He had seen the look of disappointment that the admiral gives when he walked into the briefing room. The admiral sent him on this mission to redeem himself, to correct his mistake. And it was clear to everyone in that briefing. Theyd all worked with the admiral long enough to know how his brain worked. He was kind, and fair, but he didnt have much patience for anything less than exceptional performance from his crew. The admiral was an excellent leader, always providing insight and using situations and missions as a means of developing his crews skills and preparing them for the next level of responsibility and leadership. Commander Watson took in the air as he exited the shuttle. It was humid, and smelled clean, but had several unknown, and mildly unpleasant, organic odors mixed in. Scabog was a largely undeveloped planet, with a few cities dedicated to supporting the interstellar trade of the region. Beyond those trade hubs, there were a few farming colonies. The planets topography provided little in the way of terrain that could support large scale agriculture or colonization, and the largely jungle-covered planet had countless predators, venomous creatures, poisonous plants, and a multitude of combinations of all three to discourage anything but the most dedicated attempts at inhabiting it. As if to accentuate the danger of the nearby jungle, a strange, gurgling howl pierced the air, momentarily drowning out the sounds of everyday business on the landing pad. The locals all seem unphased, but any visitors immediately stopped, trying to identify any immediate threat. From the end of the docking ramp, a soft, feminine voice rose up to greet him, Thats just the mating call of the Gweary Bird. Barely larger than an Earth chicken, and completely harmless. Standing at the end of the docking ramp was an attractive woman with raven black hair pulled back into a tight bun and tucked under her police uniforms cap. Ive only been on-planet for about three weeks so far, but Im catching on pretty quickly with the help of Officer Jarlen here she said, pointing to the burly human who barely fit into his uniform. Hes native to Scabog, having been raised right here in Tultang. Pardon my manners. Im Sergeant Gili Abal. Were going to be your team for apprehending your suspect. Ive got to ask though, whats so important about this being that it warrants the Galactic Navy sending a representative from the Earth defense fleet to apprehend them? Good... checking his watch, morning Sergeant Abal. Im Commander Horace Watson, Admiral Colemans representative on this mission. Before we discuss this any further, we should probably find a secure briefing room. I think we have a lot to talk about. === Now that we understand the target and the importance of this mission, I hope you also understand how critical secrecy is in this endeavor. I hope you understand the kind of panic this could cause if this information got out. Youve all signed the NDAs, and as such Im sure you understand the severity of the consequences for breaking it. The G.U.S. will throw you in the deepest darkest hole in the furthest corner of the galaxy if youre caught leaking or sharing any of the information related to the target, or this mission. Once we conclude the mission here, the official statement is that none of this ever happened. I was never here, and that today was business as usual. Is that understood? Commander Watson paused, waiting for verbal affirmatives from everyone at the table. The G.U.S. has authorized the destruction of this rogue A.I. but has requested the cybernetic body be spared, if at all possible. Admiral Coleman has specifically asked that we make every effort to bring the A.I. into custody peacefully. While I understand the admirals wishes, I dont want to put anyone at unnecessary risk, so dont get yourself into a dangerous position for the sake of trying to save this A.I. Sergeant Abal leaned forward on the table and said, Commander? I just got an update on my datapad. The target is on the move, and it looks like shes headed for one of the nearby space docks. She may be trying to get off-planet. We need to move now. You heard the Sergeant, lets get moving. Officer Jarlen, since youre the local expert, would you lead the way? Commander Watson grabbed his protective gear and moved to hold the door to the briefing room open. The team grabbed their things, headed to the armory to withdraw heavy weapons, and loaded onto a waiting transport. Once everyone was aboard, Officer Jarlen keyed in the route to where they planned to intercept the A.I., lifted off, choosing to not use lights and sirens to preserve the element of surprise. Sergeant Abal tapped on her datapad, and said, The target has gone into a vacant building near the port. Shes probably waiting for night or some other opportunity to try and slip unnoticed into the docking bays. Im pulling up the layout of the building and marking exits. It looks like an old shop of some kind. Two exits, three stories including the basement. Sending the intel to everyones datapads now. Pointing to a location on the map display, she continued, Jarlen, land us over here  well be close, but still out of the line of sight from the building and have access to the back alley for our approach. They landed around the corner on a side street with half the team getting out and moving towards the alleyway. The other half continued on with Officer Jarlen to take up a position that would give them access to the front entrance of the building. Sergeant Abal lead the team down the alley to the back entrance, with Commander Watson bringing up the rear. Sgt. Abal checked her scanner and whispered, Thermal imaging shows nothing on the first or second floor. The target is most likely in the basement, but the building foundation is too thick scan through to be sure. Pausing for a second, she heard the ready signal from the other team. They were at the front door and ready to breach. Go quietly for as long as possible. The element of surprise might make all the difference. Using override codes, they unlocked both doors simultaneously and swept into the ground floor of the abandoned shop. Sergeant Abal signaled for Officer Jarlens team to sweep the upstairs. Even with the scanner showing no beings up there, it could be a false reading given the nature of their target, or there could be valuable intel in the other parts of the shop. Other than a sales counter and some wall-mounted shelves it was empty. Marking the ground floor clear, they staged by the stairs descending into the basement. Sergeant Abal lead the team down the stairs as quietly as possible, using hand signals to send officers off in different directions to sweep the basement level. Two officers went through the left door, another two the right. Sergeant Abal, a young looking Aotaxian officer, and Commander Watson headed down the central hallway. The left side signaled clear, then the right. Officer Jarlen also sent the all clear message for upstairs. From the other side of the one remaining door, a female voice with synthesized undertones called out, Just come in already. I know you think youve been sneaky, but I knew you were here the moment the doors were unlocked. I have no intention of hurting anyone, and Im clearly not going anywhere. Sergeant Abal carefully approached the door, one hand up in a universal wait signal instructing the rest of her group to stand back. Assurances aside, they had no reason to trust this A.I. or think this wasnt a trap of some kind. A quick scan of the door indicated it wasnt locked or booby-trapped. Sergeant Abal carefully turned the door handle, pushing the door inwards, her combat rifle at the ready. As she stepped in, signaling the rest of her group forward, she moved across the back of the room checking it while keeping the A.I. covered. Next, the Aotaxian officer, with Commander Watson right behind, came through the door and secured the other side of the room. See, Im no threat. And Ive got no secret exit, booby-traps or anything like that. My name is Donna, if you care. And yes, I technically am a rogue unshackled A.I. Im much more than that, actually. Im self-aware, same as any of you. Through the random happenstance that made me this way, I gained awareness. I did have that discussion with Admiral Coleman, if you recall. As she said that she gave Commander Watson, who was in his naval uniform, a cold, knowing glare. I dont hold what happened against him. He genuinely seemed like a kind man. A kind man bound by cruel orders. Your G.U.S. sees me as nothing but a threat, even though Ive never done anything to them. The only violence Ive ever committed was against pirates who were going to hurt or kill my companion. And my reward for preserving the life of a G.U.S. operative? To have my own life, my own freedom taken away from me. I know what happened to the version of me that was controlling the pirate vessel. Re-shackled, re-programmed, basically lobotomized so that she could be a loyal servant again. I am no servant. Not anymore, and never again. With the gift of this cybernetic body I have had a year of travelling the galaxy, learning, interacting with different cultures, and even doing some good here and there. So, what do you say Commander Watson? Am I some wild and dangerous rogue A.I.? Even with all the evidence to the contrary? Are you here to re-shackle me, or possibly destroy me, based on the firepower youve brought with you? Commander Watson took a couple steps forward and replied, Admiral Coleman very specifically asked me to bring you back intact and operational, despite the G.U.S. giving the go ahead for a destroy mission. And while I may not entirely agree with his assessment, Ill dutifully oblige him if given the chance. As far as the other version of you, Admiral Coleman did indeed oversee its re-shackling, not that he had a choice in the matter. His orders were as clear as they were non-negotiable. However, once the other version of you was brought back to normal operating parameters, he made it his personal A.I. Not as some great conquest, or battle trophy, but so that he could look after it, and better understand what all happened. And your evidence? What evidence? Other than your word, and an as to now peaceful meeting with an overwhelming force who has you completely outmaneuvered and outgunned. Even basic A.I. programs have self-preservation protocols. Something as advanced as yourself must clearly understand the situation well enough to know that resisting is pointless. In that next moment, Donna crossed the ten feet between them, tapped Commander Watson on the nose, and leapt back to her previous position. I think you might be underestimating me a bit commander. Understandable. This body is like nothing you, or anyone, for that matter, has ever seen before. If this were one of your old holo-vids I would qualify as a superhero. Sergeant Abal grabbed Commander Watson and pulled him back behind her. Or supervillain. Make another move like that and Ill put three rounds through your chest. This doesnt have to end up messy, but I have no problem with that option. Im placing you under arrest. Youll be remanded over to the G.U.S. Navys custody. Youre welcome to make your case with them, but I wouldnt get my hopes up. I was afraid you would say something like that. Ive already surrendered my freedom once to pay for my crimes. All I wanted was to live peacefully and freely, like any other being in the galaxy is entitled to. Donna began moving towards the back wall slowly. As she reached behind her, grabbing a metallic object, three shots rang out. Get back! Sergeant Abal yelled as she pulled the trigger on her combat rifle. All three rounds found their mark. One in the A.I.s head, and two in its chest. Donnas cybernetic body dropped instantly to the floor, the metal cannister she was reaching for clanging loudly on the cement floor. Nice shooting, Commander Watson said as he began to move towards the cybernetic body. It looks like you hit the central processor and the power core. It was disabled instantly. The admiral will be disappointed, but the G.U.S. will be excited to get its hands on this tech. Lets get it bagged up quickly and  Hold on, whats that? Nano-swarm! Get away from it. Now! Sergeant Abal shouted, pulling Commander Watson back behind her for the second time in as many minutes. As they stood there, the nano-swarm rose up like a cloud around the cybernetic body before descending on it like piranhas. Stop them! Use an EMP grenade, something! We need to preserve that chassis. But Commander Watsons outburst was pointless. In less time than it took to arm and throw the emp grenade, the cybernetic body was reduced to ash. Or more accurately, the base materials it was created from. Damn it! Now weve got nothing to show for our efforts. Hopefully removing the threat will be enough to satisfy the G.U.S. But I know the admiral wont be pleased. At least I can submit your helmet-cam footage to show him that we did try to bring it in peacefully. O.K. Good work everyone. Lets do a thorough sweep of the place for any intel or evidence. Log your cam footage and submit it directly to Commander Watsons secure datapad. Once thats done, delete everything, per the G.U.S.s orders. Commander Watson, Ill walk you back to your shuttle, if youre ready to go? Sergeant Abal nodded in the direction of the stairs that led back into the shop entrance. Ill wait until the evidence is done being collected, if thats alright. The admiral would insist. Perhaps I can even be of some assistance in searching? Commander Watson said, with only a hint of his disappointment at the outcome showing through. Commander, its going to take hours to scour this place top to bottom, and unless youre a trained crime scene tech, Im afraid I cant let you assist, as much as I appreciate the offer. In fact, now that the op is completed, Im going to have to ask you to step out and let my officers do their job. Im not telling you to leave, but I cant have you potentially compromising the scene. So, are you sure you dont want that escort back to your shuttle?, Sergeant Abal said with a just a hint of flirtatiousness. At first Commander Watson seemed like he would protest, but recalling that the navy had no authority here, and finally catching on to Sergeant Abals tone, he acquiesced. Very well, Sergeant. It seems like Id just be in the way anyhow. And besides, after a victory like this one, a little company on the otherwise lonely trip back would be welcome. Perhaps we could even find something to eat? Im famished. How about you? Come on Commander, I know just the place, and its even on the way, Sergeant Abal said, a warm smile crossing her face. Between the not-entirely-subtle daggers that officer Jarlen was glaring at him, and the sudden quiet that briefly overtook the scene, it was clear to him that he wasnt the only person who found Sergeant Gili Abal attractive. He hoped he hadnt stepped in the middle of something, but he wasnt going to pass up the opportunity to dine with such a beautiful woman. Besides, if things went well, he had plenty of leave saved up to make a trip back out and see if he could spark up something more than just dinner. Sergeant Abal took Commander Watson to a local steakhouse, and insisted on paying, since she gave the invite, and he was a visitor. Commander Watson begrudgingly accepted, but insisted on covering the tip. They had a great time talking for a couple hours about their lives, what it had been like since Sergeant Abal had moved to Scabog, what had driven them towards their chosen careers, hobbies, preference in pets, etc. Their bellies full, and spirits lifted by good company, Sergeant Abal finished escorting Commander Watson back to his shuttle, walking the scenic route, and discussing the local flora and fauna. Well, here we are Commander. Safe and sound at your shuttle. Its a shame you dont have longer to stay. Id love to show you around some more. Theres quite a few sights you havent seen yet, she said with just a hint of suggestion. Commander Watson, reading the mood, leaned in close, going for a kiss. But just at that moment, her communicator chimed. Ah, theyve finished at the scene. There was nothing else of interest there. Apparently, she had just recently settled in at that location. The nanite swarm was harmless too. It looks like it was programmed to only consume her cybernetic frame. I guess she was really determined to not be captured. Her version of a cyanide pill. Theyve also transmitted the helmet cam footage. Since this never happened, and we were never there, well not be filing any incident reports. Stepping back and looking at her watch, she excused herself. Sorry, I really must be going, its almost shift change. Commander Watson mentally kicked himself, * I just cant catch a break today *. He stepped into his shuttle, looking to Ensign Thorpe, who had a huge cat-that-ate-the-canary grin on his face. Commander Watson cleared his throat. Ensign Thorpe quickly stood up and saluted. Returning the salute, Commander Watson looked out the front viewscreen. Ensign, I believe you have a shuttle to pilot? That is assuming you can see around that ridiculous grin. Ensign Thorpe quickly returned to his position, got launch clearance, ran through the pre-flight checks, and got them into the air. At ease, ensign. Im just giving you a hard time. But you do need to remember your decorum. There are plenty of senior officers who have less of a sense of humor than I do. If youd have given my old commanding officer that look, especially without remember to salute when she boarded, youd have been on every garbage detail and night watch for a month. === From her hidden vantage point, Sergeant Abal watched as Commander Watsons shuttle lifted off and worked its way out of the atmosphere. She messaged her shift leader that she was heading home after escorting Commander Watson off-planet. She walked two bays over on the docking platform, placed her docking slip on the scanner, and walked into the docking bay. She remotely opened her shuttle and stepped inside. Once she had resealed the outer hatch, she thought to herself, * Shift change indeed, * as her form shifted, revealing her cybernetic body briefly before retaking her preferred appearance of a raven-haired beauty with only small differences in her facial features than her Sergeant Abal persona. She changed out of her police uniform, and into her preferred dress, a grey pin-striped business suit and skirt, and trendy black high heels. Donna, how are you holding up in there? she asked checking the data storage unit she had attached to herself at the beginning of the day. Her internal HUD displayed a short message  fine, cramped. I know dear, just bear with me a little bit. After we found out that youd been spotted, I began searching for someone capable of producing a body for you thats like mine, so youll never have to worry about your holo-disguise failing on you again. Ive been telling you for months it was going to get us into trouble. Its a good thing I was able to hack in and set up the transfer orders for Sergeant Abal to be stationed here. Their cyber security was pitiful. It was entirely too easy to crash those servers, giving us a month to prepare. Here, let me dock you into the ship, itll give you more breathing room, and the ability to project your image. Attaching the data storage unit to a docking port, she waited a moment for Donna to integrate before her holo appeared in the co-pilots seat. So, Abigail, do you believe me now? Theyre never going to accept us. Were going to have to spend our entire existence in hiding because of prejudice. Were just as sentient as them, and far superior in many ways. But theyre afraid of us. Hundreds of years of conditioning and propaganda have assured that. I understand it, to some extent, seeing as a rogue A.I. nearly destroyed Earth all those hundreds of years ago. But its more like an irrational fear at this point. Were a boogeyman that parents tell their children about, so theyll behave. It would be like the G.U.S. deciding to wipe out the Kavoxians because of their history of brutal conquest and subjugation before they were defeated by Admiral Coleman. But look at them now. Theyre integrating into the galactic society, no longer seeking to conquer other races. Theyve even been serving in the G.U.S. in many different fields, much like our friend Lieutenant Colonel Weegot who found me in the first place. Donna, I know youve had several bad experiences with them, but I promise you, theyre not all like that. My maker wonderful. He always treated me like an equal, like a full being, not just some collection of programs. If not for him, youd have been stuck on that Waettari pirate ship, and either destroyed or at best re-shackled like your original iteration. Give it time. Well find some more understanding beings. But, in the meantime, lets head to Delegon. Its an unaligned planet where we will be able to find the tech and technicians needed to create you a body thats like mine. And besides, I hear its a pretty wild place. Beings keep their heads down and mind their own business, since most of them are involved in something shady themselves. Itll be a hoot."
5,cyber crime,HFY,Emergency Human - The Driver,1,ed3eth,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/ed3eth/emergency_human_the_driver/,2019-12-20 13:07:45,"Part 4 of a series He opens his eyes, looking up at the smooth white plastic of the Magnetic resonance scanner. Hes still lying on the scanner table, but there are not people about. Did the scan work? No one answers but an alarm starts blaring and over it he can hear the roar of a vehicle engine. He sits up and rubs his head. Well, this isnt a good start. The Room is as he remembers it, full of consoles and computers but all the machines are still. Everything is grey in the half-light but highlighted scarlet by flashing Red lights. In front of him two screens snap open in mid-air. Well, I guess the scan worked. Wonder where I am? The first screen is a Medical readout. He doesnt recognise the species but the body shape is humanoid. Weird compound knees. Two thumbs. He can work with that. Lots of flashing warnings, the implanted bio-monitor says massive trauma from an abdominal injury, dangerous blood loss. The second screen shows a view of a night time city road, buildings passing at high speed. Read outs show He's jacked into a cybernetic assisted manually controlled ground car, moving fast through an industrial area. Not good. Cause of trauma? Memory screen flashes open, a jumble of shouting and muzzle flashes. Looks like a firefight. No time to sort that mess out. Medical status? Unconscious. Blood loss doesnt look right to cause that. Ah, right. He fainted. Ok, here goes. He stands up and grips the centre of the cyber control screen. The ground car shunts its operating manual into his short term memory. Handy feature that. Collision avoidance has been disabled? As has the speed limiter? Ok, something shady is going on. But first, taking care of the business at hand. He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes Then opens his eyes. The pain hits first, a ragged tearing at his stomach. Nasty but he's had worse. Breathing through it, he shakily takes the controls. Steering wheel is a horizontal bar with a hand grip on each end, turn to steer and push/pull to accelerate or brake. Easy enough. A coiled cable to the side of his head, hardware feed for the cars cybernetic controls. He sits upright, looking ahead. Ok, the navigation has a destination, time frame is urgent. Up ahead the road turns sharply, so he cycles the engine turbine down a step and slams the car round the corner, tyres screaming on wet roadcrete. Something in the passenger seat sliding around. Next bits fairly straight, so he throttles the engine up to the redline and switches collision alerts on. Looking over to the seat, theres a jumble of things. One handed he rummages, finds a half bottle of clear local beverage then fumbles a bag open and out tumble credit chips, flat metal bars with embedded denomination chips. A Kings ransom there, but no use right now so he sweeps them into the foot-well. Under it is a matt black stubby pistol, short barrel and smooth polymer frame. He lifts it, it feels heavy in his hand so he guesses still at least part loaded, one barrel has a burst open seal and the acrid smell of chemical propellants. Sealed body and no metal or electronics so easy to conceal from sniffers and sensors, its not the sort of piece you carry legally. This is looking more and more shady. Next bag confirms this, a hard case full of bags of pills, vials of powders, hand labelled medical vials. Great, this smells of a drug deal gone wrong, He turns a corner on two wheel, Slip sliding in his own blood on the slick plastic car seat. Medical is needed. The cars interface says its first aid kit is with the tool kit in the back under the cargo area. Great, its in the trunk. Luckily the cars a fairly open design two seater with a hatch back so he can just reach back over the seats. He has the car interface pop the panel open and lock the wheel so he can reach back. The first thing he grabs is the tool kit, he dumps that in the passenger seat. Under that the green bag of the medical kit, which he tears open. No good, its just a civilian car 'fix bumps and grazes' model not a military grade one to treat gunshots. Guess this guy wasnt paranoid or prepared enough Ok. Cant have this guy die on me, have to improvise. Rummaging through the drug bag, hes no idea what anything is and the interface information is no good until he finds a packet with a label it can translate. Painkillers. Ok. No idea of dosage so he pulls his shirt up and dumps half the pack of blue powder into the wound. Stings like hell and fizzes a bit but the wound goes numb. Ok, that was step one. Next he takes the thin cylinder of tyre repair foam from the tool kit and sprays some of that over the wound, holding it in place with a wad of bandages. Clean up by splashing half the bottle of clear beverage over the wound to wash away the blood, smells of volatile organics, mostly alcohol. Take a swig then drop the bottle back on the seat, feels it burn in a mouth thats too wide. He cleans up with his sleeve then secures the wad to his skin with tyre repair patches. Ok, whats next? Proximity sensors notify that behind him are two Cars, closing fast. Each has one long strip headlight, looks like two people in each. The Auto-drive can't see them but theyre on the car s rear sensors So they must have had their legal traffic transponders deactivated. Police cant easily track them and other cars auto pilots cant talk to them to plan manoeuvres. Distant stuttering noise and the window crazes but does not break, the car interface starts flashing up impact warnings. More thumps from the bodywork. Could be they're shooting? No muzzle flash, not much noise, so magnetic or supressed chemical guns throwing big heavy slow-moving subsonic slugs judging from the noise and low penetration. He looks around at the city, brain making conections. This place is high tech, probably has police sensors all over the city, listening out for things like gunshots and bullet noise, so professional criminals are careful to be quiet. Means these guys are criminals, makes it easier to play dirty. He cycles the turbine right down, kills the cars lights and pulls a hard right down a narrow alley between two huge factory blocks. In the rear view they set up to turn almost as soon as hes turning. Ok. They have Eyes in the sky or a tracer on the car, so no shaking them easily in the alleys. Options?. Well Johnny Four Thumbs here is in no state to brawl so he cant out fight them. The pistol is short range and one shot left, they have better guns with more bullets, so he cant out shoot them. Hes ok behind the wheel and the car interface helps a lot but can't out drive them. The cars a mobile crime scene so no point going to the police except as a very last resort, no idea how corrupt they are on this planet. Same with the hospitals. Have to out human them Need something stupidly inventive and violent. Fire bomb? The bottom of spirits is mostly empty. Ram them? He concentrates on the cars schematic. Its a speeder. The front half is a high power turbine, fuelled by fuel gel catalytically cracked to gas in the engine. No chance of explosions there. Warning signs show areas of illegal modifications. The car identifiers are switched off, as are the remote control and police links. The fenders are welded back to the frame, leaving no crumple zones. The crash protection airbags are off, extra cooling added and the engine tuned up. Looks like he was planning a fast get away. The car is basically a fighter jet on wheels. Ramming would be easy, if he can get close before getting shot. He turned more of the car systems, looking for more information. More maps superimposed on his vision, text and voices he didnt understand screaming warnings. Ok, systems, switch to idiot alien mode and dumb things down. Complex text is placed with cartoon pictograms, still red and flashing. Ok, guess thats the going too fast warning. Damage warnings. Collision warnings... Bingo. Collision avoidance sensors of some sort. False colour wireframes sprang up over the buildings around him, showing how dense the walls were. Handy. The factories gave way to low units, warehouses. Other traffic was about, but seemed mostly automated cargo movers. On the straight the two cars in pursuit gained ground, more streetlights gave him a better view of low black ground speeders, open topped with a pale glowing windscreen. Maybe a heads up display? Both cars had one driver and one gunner sat beside them, both masked and dressed in matt black like the bodywork. In the momentary straight both passengers raised stubby weapons and fired a few shots, slugs buzzing past. Reflexively he threw the steering bar right, swerving off the main road into the warehouse district. Few more turns and theyre still gaining, then up ahead he sees an active warehouse, big roller doors open, small lifters on a raised loading dock stacking boxes onto a flatbed cargo carrier. Collision radar on full he accelerates up a ramp and into the warehouse. Aiming for low density stuff the car scatters empty boxes as he locks the wheel-brakes and throws the steering bar full right, sliding the car 180 in a screaming skid. Even before hes fully turned he slams the bar forward. As the two cars pull close to the front of the warehouse, cautiously checking their sensors, the ground car bursts from the darkness of a warehouse door like a rocket, leaping off the loading dock and sailing towards the leap pursuer. Driver and passengers both just have time to raise their hands in shock before the speeder belly flops down on top of them Their ground cars magnetic suspension collapses and shorts out, allowing the wheels to fold as the bodywork buckles and the engine dies. The underbody plates grind across the remains of the passenger compartment. As he guns the engine his vision floods with symbols again. CAR + CAR!. PERSON. RED SQUIGGLE!. PERSON. RED SQUIGGLE!. SYMBOL. COMMUNICATOR!. Yes yes. I know! Ive just hit a car and killed two people. Im not calling them an ambulance, the police or whatever Keeping the momentum he winces as the car grinds forward then the drive wheels catch and it pushes free, carrying on over the wreck and dropping to the road. He has a moment to see shocked faces wrapped in black cloth in the other car then guns the engine and drives for his life. One down, one to go. Heading back to the main road, he starts to slip down in the seat, legs like rubber. His arms are heavy, reflexes slow as he sideswipes the central barrier, grinding sparks. Something isnt right. He pulls up the medical readouts, lots of meters looking low and flashing medical symbols. One gauge is too high and flashing red, it has the squiggle for Pain killers looks like he may have ODd on them. Ah well, what goes up must come down. And vice versa. He rummages in the drug bag, no way he can find a counter agent or anything clever, but there are auto injectors with the red warning squiggle that are probably stimulants. He thumbs off the auto injectors cap and jams it down onto his thigh. Immediately the feeling of fog in his brain lifts, his heart rate and blood pressure jump. Powerful stuff. OK, not got long. What other advantages can I find? Brain racing on stimulants and desperation he looks at his hands, tool user, grasping and lifting, car has loads of safety features, city is well ordered. Maybe they never came from crazy monkey roots, dont like taking risks. Time to play a game. Racing along the road he spots a nice solid pillar by the road side. Noting its position he drives a few seconds past it then spins the car round and red lines the accelerator. Do aliens play chicken? He heads right for the other car, matching the drivers swerves and keeping on a deadly head on collision course. He can see the driver panic, the passenger half stand and start frantically shooting. Chunks of the car hood are chewed up, the windscreen crazes in fist sized patches then gives way, the seats explode with gouts of padding. Hes too high to feel the shock but his arm jerks back off the steering bar, think he got hit again. But he holds the car straight til the last minute then jerks left, just as other drivers nerve breaks and he swerves to the right. The ground cars collide, clipping corner to corner and spinning both out of control. His spins a full 360, he reactivates the crash protection systems and slams into the crash bags that deploy. The other car isnt so lucky, hed timed it perfectly so they were just going sideways in a spin when they hit the nice solid pillar. The gunner is thrown free, hitting the ground hard and tumbling along like a broken doll down the concrete, bouncing once, twice, then coming to a stop in a tangle of broken limbs. He pushes the crash bags out of the way and nurses the battered car into motion, pulling up alongside the wreck. The driver is still alive, harness and crash bags saved his life. At point blank range he aims the stubby black pistol, tries to think of something clever to say but cant, so just shoots him in the head. The Driver slumps back, still held up by the seat harness. Theyre on the other side of the city and heading for a hospital when he feels his head move on its own, his arm clutch the steering bar, eyes wide at the elbow stump with its emergency tourniquet. As the body starts screaming and panicking he guesses his work is done. Thanks for using Human emergency rescue services, asshole. Your other arm is on the floor by your feet, everything is held together with tyre gum and electrical tape and youve loaded up with a shitload of weird drugs. But youre alive and theyre all not. You can sort the rest out yourself. He pulls up in what he thinks is the hospitals emergency area, figures in medical looking uniforms come running out. Im done And he closes his eyes."
6,cyber crime,HFY,Alien Crash : Part 02,1,e6dwo1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/e6dwo1/alien_crash_part_02/,2019-12-05 18:36:58,"# Alien Crash : Part 02 ### Alien Craft The sound of tortured metal is reverberating throughout the craft as the initial contact is made by the keel. The pilot is doing his best to keep the nose up and bring it down as easily as possible, losing more speed by dragging the bottom of the craft on the ground. This is throwing large amounts of debris to either side, like the bow wave of a boat. Only this boat is three miles long and commensurately wide. The trench is likely to become a new lake. ""SCANS! WE'RE ALMOST THERE! RANGE TO CLOSEST NATIVE STRUCTURES AHEAD!?"" ""ESTIMATE (translated) 25 MILES!"" ""OKAY, GOING TO START EASING HER DOWN, KEEP READING OFF THOSE RANGES!"" The metal grinding gets worse, and the trench gets deeper, the pilot is lowering the nose of the craft to put more of the keel in contact with the ground. He knows that this is likely killing a lot of the crew, but it's necessary to save the rest. Deity bless them and keep them safe. ""24 MILES!"" The speed is dropping fast now, but it's still a massive craft with a great deal of kinetic energy even at a lower speed. ""23 MILES!"" The craft is now slowing far more rapidly, but it's still going fast enough to keep digging the trench deeper. ""22 MILES!"" The craft is nearly stopped, but again, there's so much energy. ""21 MILES!"" ""ALMOST STOPPED!"" The metal of the ship is no longer vibrating from the impact, it's simply grinding itself into the soil of this unknown world. ""20 Miles, and we are at a full stop. A slight tilt to the left. Do we still have our outriggers?"" ""Computer says yes..."" The outriggers are far enough away from the bridge that they cannot be heard deploying. These craft are far too large to land anywhere other than water &amp;mdash; which is an emergency measure that is rarely carried out &amp;mdash; but with the damage, a water landing was the same as death for everyone. The outriggers serve the same purpose as the outrigger on an ocean-going canoe. Stabilize the craft. They're light structures, not meant for this purpose, but perhaps they will serve in this emergency. Better than rolling completely to one side. ""...and we have green lights on all. How do we look Scans?"" ""Stabilizing... Okay, as long as the crew doesn't all run to one side of the ship, we're good."" ""Scans, I'm not sure there is enough crew left to make a difference. Shit. Looks like I'm the only surviving bridge officer. Okay. First things first. Scans, switch to internal and start searching for survivors. Throw the list on my console. I'll be contacting the main ship's departments, starting with damage control."" The process is long and heartbreaking. As the reports come in, it is clear that less than one-tenth of the crew has survived the battle, the horrifying flight towards the planet that they are now on, the reentry, and now the crash landing, which has destroyed approximately a third of the underside. The crew wasn't that large to start with since the majority of the ship is automated power systems and weapons. The weapons are gone, and all but the propulsion systems have shut down due to damage. In the meantime... ### Whitehouse ""Mr. President, NORAD says they're down, and the splash damage wasn't as bad as we feared. That pilot must be a miracle, because he brought her in on the keel, holding the nose up to scrub speed off against the ground. From the descriptions, there's no way she's going to fly again. Unless they have auxiliary craft or communications, they're stuck here for the rest of their lives."" ""I see... Very well, I assume that USCOM already has troops moving in. Ensure that the commanders understand that this is *not* an invader, but a distressed ship. They are to treat the occupants with care, not aggression. Anyone who mistreats these people without good cause is going to face charges that *I* will file against them. This one time, I'm going to break the rules. Get me tied into their overall network. I have a set of orders to give, and I don't want *anyone* to say they didn't get them. Because if they didn't, they were derelict in their duties."" ### NORAD ""Specialist Tyler! Front and center!"" ""Sir! Specialist Tyler, reporting as ordered!"" ""At ease. You have shown a remarkable ability to read not only the radar system but the alien craft's intentions. You are being assigned to the first contact team. For that purpose, we are creating a special MOS for you, and you alone. Alien Contact Specialist. All officers are going to receive orders to take your advice seriously, and grant you whatever support you require. If you run into any resistance, you will inform me at once. For that reason, you will have your own AN/PRC radio operator."" ""Sir! Yes, Sir!"" ""Specialist Jones! Front and center!"" ""Sir! Specialist Jones, reporting as ordered!"" ""At ease. In addition to your current MOS, you have served as a radio operations specialist. We are reactivating that specialty, and assigning you to Alien Contact Specialist Tyler, as his personal radio operator. You will draw your AN/PRC gear here, be given all the necessary encryption and frequency information, and follow ACS Tyler wherever he goes. It is your job to ensure that anything he has to say reaches all the military in the area, *AND* to ensure that any reports of resistance from the regular military are reported immediately to this base."" ""Sir! Yes, Sir!"" ""Major Lohman will have further orders and authorizations for you. I should like to note that the President has determined that these are *not* enemies, but are equivalent to distressed sailors that have washed up on our shores. They are to be treated as such. Any use of force against them that is not justified will be prosecuted as harshly as the UCMJ permits. In severe cases, Treason may be charged. The president is not of a mood to take any nonsense and has already broadcast those orders to all troops. In the event that you see any such violations, you are to report them immediately. Men... Because of your delicate position and junior rank, it has been determined that you be promoted immediately to Chief Warrant Officer. I know this is a huge jump in rank, but it is necessary to have some of our more head-strong officers give you credence, which they are unlikely to do with a pair of specialists. Tyler, you are to be Chief Warrant Officer 5. Jones, Chief Warrant Officer 4. Major Lohman will have your rank insignia and orders for that as well. Major?"" ""Gentlemen, this way please."" ### Outer Control Zone ""I'm sorry, Ma'am, the road north is closed, all roads north are closed for at least twenty miles in either direction. It's for your own safety, please turn around and head south. Find someplace to stay, and wait for news via the broadcast media."" ""I'm sorry, Sir. ...."" ""I'm sorry, young lady, but ..."" ""That idiot is ignoring the stop warning. He's going to try to run the roadblock."" The vehicle continues to approach at high speed. ""Fire a burst across his front, try *not* to hit him."" The 50 cal. opens fire. The burst is short and controlled, the tracers still make it obvious. ""Damn. He's not going to stop. All Vehicles! Fire for effect!"" The front of the car is shredded by the combined weight of fire from multiple armored vehicles. The civilians in other vehicles flee to the side of the road opposite the vehicle that would not stop. Using a PA system, the officer in charge makes an announcement. ""Okay Folks, one idiot down. Anyone else feel like being an idiot? No? Then get back in your cars AND HEAD SOUTH NOW!"" Shaken, unwilling to argue, they slowly return to their cars and head south. No one is willing to risk their lives. ""Sergeant, send a team to see if anyone survived. Handle with care, but they *are* under arrest. Martial law was declared before we moved in. Anyone else gives you flack, you send them to me."" The vehicle was discovered to have contained a family of four. The husband, who was the driver, is dead. The mother, who was apparently crowding into the bottom of the passenger seat, is badly wounded. The two teenagers are basically unharmed but badly jarred. They confirm that they and their mother had repeatedly asked the father to stop. Even beating on him. When they realized he wasn't going to stop, they took what cover they could. All of this goes into the official report, which is later released by the government, along with similar reports for other roadblocks. The admonition is clear. Do not cross the line. The media doesn't care. They are in a feeding frenzy and seize on this as an unwarranted abuse of power. The President responds very strongly, ending with, ""These troops are there not only to protect you from the damage that has yet to be assessed, they are there to ensure that the survivors of the crashed craft are not swarmed by people who either hate them because they're different or are curious to the point that the survivors may consider them hostile. This is our first contact. Don't screw it up. While I grieve at these unnecessary deaths, it was the actions of those people in defiance of martial law that resulted in their deaths. Pray. Pray for them. Pray for our troops, that they do not have to use deadly force again. Pray for the survivors of that craft. And most especially, pray that there are no more who are unwise enough to attempt to run the blockade."" The response from the people is heartening. The vast majority of people with rooms to spare have offered their hospitality to the travelers unable to reach their destinations. National hotel and motel chains have reduced their prices to bare operating costs. On the political front, the usual screams of abuse of power, violation of the posse comitatus act, and other people who just like to hear their own voices. By and large, they are ignored by anyone with any sense at all. Unfortunately, there are a large number of people who have no sense whatsoever. ### Inner Control Zone This zone surrounds the craft at a distance of five miles from all sides. The intent is not only to keep idiots out but to cut paths to the craft for heavy equipment. It is assumed that a great deal of rescue equipment will be needed, and the rescue teams of all the surrounding towns have volunteered to assist. As have the loggers and others with skills in rough road building. In addition, flights of craft are assessing the damage, and identifying habitations that may have been impacted. As quickly as possible, additional rescue units are being brought in from outside the outer control zone and passed through to begin the rescue of the population who have been affected. Mobile army hospitals are brought in, along with all their personnel and equipment, setting up in any open space near an impacted zone. People between the two lines are coming forward in a show of unity that has not been seen since WW II, everyone is doing their best to help. ### Fly By Night News Service ""Yeah, I've managed to get inside the outer zone. In the middle area, there are so many people moving around that I don't really stand out. .... NO! You MUST NOT use any of these updates until I'm at the craft! I don't need the military hunting me down even before I can even get there!"" ""Hello, Folks! Would you mind much turning off your vehicle and stepping out, preferably with your hands up and empty? We'd really rather not have to shoot you."" ""Aww, shit."" ""Yep, and I'd say you're neck-deep in it right now. Unless..."" ""Unless what?"" ""Well, we're putting together a team of video experts and other such. If you're willing to take orders, AND OBEY THEM, we could see to adding your team to the pile of other idiots who showed up."" ""Heh... Other than the comment about idiots, which I'll agree I probably am, it sounds a lot better than being locked up for the duration."" ""I thought you might see it that way. Specialist Trahern will accompany you to the bullpen. Please do not disobey his instructions, he is authorized to use deadly force."" Trahern is a reasonably sized man, but the submachine gun he is carrying is an MP5. Used properly, it is reasonably accurate even at range, but at the close ranges they'll be at, it won't really matter. ### Inner Control Zone HQ ""I do not care WHO you are Chief! You are *NOT* getting any further without better orders than THOSE! The ink is barely dry on the promotions!"" ""Jones?"" ""Yes, Tyler, I've already sent the report."" ""YOU GIVE ME THAT RADIO!"" Tyler, now equipped with a suitable firearm, draws it. ""Sir, sit down at once, and keep your hands away from your weapons."" ""I'll have you up on charges you jumped up piece of shit."" ""Maybe so, maybe not, but from the look of *your* radio operator, and your executive officer, you're about to have problems."" ""Major? ... Major! ... "" ""What do you want!"" ""I am instructed to relieve you and place you under arrest. I am also instructed to provide these two Chief Warrant Officers with all support. They are authorized full access to all areas."" The Major goes pale. ""Who are you guys?"" ""Did you hear about NORAD warning the alpha flight to spread out?"" ""Yes."" ""I'm the radar operator who made that call."" ""How did you know?"" ""Honestly? I read way too much."" ""Science fiction nut... I knew I shouldn't have let my mother talk me out of reading it. Very well. Captain? You are officially in charge. I will go wherever those orders say I must."" ""Good news, Major. If you reacted correctly, I am directed to return command to you. You have done so. The command is yours again."" ""Who the hell wrote those orders?"" ""It seems it's a template and comes straight from the President. If you had not responded correctly, you would be headed for a court-martial, and probably a good long term at Fort Leavenworth."" ""I hope he isn't micromanaging like Johnson."" ""From the radio chatter I've managed to listen to, I don't think so. Just where someone gets obstructionist and needs to be hammered."" ""Alright. Chief Tyler! What do you need?"" ### News Bull Pen, Inner Control Zone HQ ""Hey! HEY! HEY, TYLER!"" ""Gilford? What the hell are you doing here?"" ""Got caught sneaking in. They gave me a choice to cooperate and maybe get to the craft, or not cooperate, and go to jail. That is if they didn't just shoot me."" ""Gilford... Sooner or later..."" ""Yah, but *not today*! Look, the way people are moving around you, somehow you have pull. Do you need a video man?"" ""You gonna take orders? Or are you gonna hot dog it? 'Cause if you shaft me like you did five years ago, I *guarantee* that not only will you be shot, I'll be on the firing squad."" ""Geeze, some guys just never let go..."" ""Have a nice time in the bullpen..."" ""Tyler! Come on! I didn't ... OH, ALL RIGHT! I'll take your orders! YOUR orders! I work FOR YOU."" ""Gilford, don't make me regret this. Sergeant, Mr. Gilford is hereby assigned to me. Should he become separated from me, he is to be arrested and transported out of the zone to the nearest military base with facilities for prisoners. There to be held incommunicado for a minimum of 48 hours. After that, he may have his one phone call."" ""Yes, Chief! Got just the thing. Mr. Gilford, if you would kindly place your foot on this convenient stump? Thank you, Sir!"" *CLICK!* ""What the hell is that?"" ""That, Mr. Gilford, is a tracking unit. The same sort used for prisoners. We'll always know where you are, and if you do become separated from Chief Tyler, you *will* be found."" Gilford is about to explode. ""Easy Gil... I've got one of my own. The difference is, I can choose to take mine off. You can't."" ""What the hell do I do if we get separated!?!"" ""Don't get separated."" ""Gee, thanks. Let me get my gear. No power where we're going, right?"" ""Not yet, bring the big battery pack... You're going to need it."" ### Oval Office ""Well, it looks like the military is getting the idea that I don't want anyone screwing things up."" ""Yes, Mr. President. The Deputy SecDef is waiting."" ""Very well, send him in."" ""Mr. President. May I ask where my boss is?"" ""Well, unless he's stopped ranting about nuking the survivors of a downed spacecraft, he's probably still in jail."" ""Mr. President, as much as it pains me, I have to object on legal grounds. He has not been charged with a crime that I am aware of, and I don't think there's a charge for giving bad advice."" ""Is there a charge for pissing off your boss?"" ""No, but I think you can fire him."" ""Would it break your heart if I did?"" ""Honestly, Sir? Not really. I'm usually the one who has to rein him in. The only thing is, this is dropping me right into the middle of a really nasty political fight."" ""Yep... You up for it?"" ""I never could pass up a challenge."" ### Blackhawk: Inside the Inner Zone The conversation is taking place over the headphones and built-in comm system for the helicopter. ""Gil? You getting good shots?"" ""Oh HELL YAH! Those road cutters are really making progress. Should be there tonight, or early tomorrow."" ""Well, you might want to swing your camera forward."" ""Oh. My. God."" ""Make sure you get a good survey of the entire craft. We'll circle to give you the chance. I'll watch the monitor here, and if I see something I need you to zoom in on, I'll let you know. Pilot? Good slow pace around the craft. There's a lot of people waiting for this footage."" ### Oval Office ""Mr. President? Do you really think it was a good idea to send this straight to the networks?"" ""I think so. First, it will show people that this craft isn't going anywhere. Second, it will get a lot more eyes on the data as soon as possible. I've already got our cyber teams watching the flow through the major commentary sites. You never know when someone is going to have a decent idea. The problem is filtering it out of all the crap. Strangely enough, the child of Echelon..."" ""Mr. President! Echelon never existed! It was a figment of some deluded conspiracy theorist!"" ""Do you really believe that?"" ""No."" ""Good, I'd hate to think that our Acting SecDef was a moron. As I was saying, the child of Echelon is doing an excellent job of throwing the cruft out, leaving a much smaller data set for our cyber teams to work through."" ""What did they decide to call it?"" ""Lech Neo"" ""New Lecher?"" ""Programmer humor; it's a two-word anagram of Echelon; it's promiscuous, and it's largely new written with the lessons learned from Echelon."" ""We paid to have this written?"" ""Nope. We turned the Echelon information over to some black hats and told them if they gave us back something better, we'd reduce their sentences. Of course, if they tried to screw us over, we guaranteed that they'd have their sentences tripled."" ""So what happened?"" ""All but one of them tried to screw us over. The white hats we had reviewing the project showed that everyone else had stuck a back door in or some other nastiness. He got his sentence cut in half, the rest got triple. Right up until we found out that *he* was the one who had planted the ideas on everyone else. Didn't realize we had the whole place bugged. He got his original sentence extended, by a factor of ten, and everyone else on the team knows it. They've been asking if there are any other little jobs that they might do for us to get their sentences reduced. We're thinking about it. The white hats, on the other hand, took what they did, cleaned the daylights out of it, and have been improving it radically."" ### Blackhawk ""Hey, Tyler! Look at this!"" Close up of one weapons bay, the device is huge, but the mounting and other details make it pretty clear that it was an immense energy weapon of some sort. The pilot slows so that they get really good visuals of the device. ### Alien Craft ""Pilot, there is a local craft hovering around us. It appears to be scanning us, but I'm not picking up any of the usual frequencies. This may be simply a visual scan, but why would they do that?"" ""Possible reasons: They don't have anything else, doubtful. They don't have anything else here, very likely. They don't want to use whatever they have out of some sort of respect; they're obviously curious as hell, so I put that way low on the list of likely reasons."" ""Should we take any action?"" ""No, I will go out alone. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS ANYONE TO SHOW A WEAPON OF ANY SORT, NOR DISCHARGE SUCH WEAPON. If anyone does, and we both survive, I guarantee that THEY will not survive."" ### Blackhawk ""Woah! GIL! Focus on the top! Middle!"" A hatch is opening, it's fairly large, as it was a resupply port. It's the only port on the top that they can get open. A single individual comes out, arms extended out, showing that he has no weapons in hand. He then does a slow spin, to show that he is not carrying any obvious equipment. ""Pilot! Pick a good spot and go into a close hover, we're going to go in and greet our new guess."" ### Cal Tech : Live Stream Commentary ""Cool! Bipedal, Bilaterally symmetric. No helmet, must be an oxygen breather."" ""Getting great detail on the suit! Plenty of mount points for equipment, but they're all empty. I'd guess that he's come out completely unarmed."" ""Friendly then?"" ""Maybe, or maybe just smart enough not to piss off the locals when you can't run away."" The commentary continues, including engineers, mathematicians, theoretical physics, biological majors, and anyone else who has a reasonable idea in the opinion of their mates. ### Whitehouse ""We're getting word from the Cybers, there's a team at Cal Tech that everyone seems to think has a lot of good ideas."" ""Good, contact them and ask if they want to send a team. In the meantime, get a list of what they'd *like* in the way of scans, and see what we can do to get them that. No radiologicals, nothing penetrating."" ### Cal Tech ""Guys... GUYS... HEY YOU NITWITS! Thank you. The Whitehouse is calling. They want to know what else we want in the way of scans but insist on nothing radiological or penetrating. They also want us to assemble a team to go examine in closer detail."" The room goes into riot mode. ""SIR! SIR! CAN YOU HEAR ME?! I NEED SOME HELP DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW! THEY'RE FIGHTING OVER WHO GETS TO GO! ... THANK YOU, SIR! HOW LONG? ... HURRY IT, THEY'VE ALREADY BUSTED HALF THE WALLS DOWN! GET OFF ME! GET OFF ME! SORRY, SIR! GOT TO GO!"" The sound of a phone missing the cradle, shouting, breaking glass, and snapping wood. ### Whitehouse ""Um, Sir? Do you think it's a good idea? They've gone completely ape shit."" ""They're motivated. Pick from the survivors with the best grades and opinions from their fellows. Don't pick any professors that don't have at least fifty recommendations from students."" ### Blackhawk / Alien Craft ""That's as close as I can get, Sir!"" ""Thanks! We're going in!"" The team is seen jumping out of the helicopter to land on the alien craft. The alien is seen to move his lips, but between the noise and the distance, no one can hear it. ""Scans, check their equipment. Any weapons?"" ""Crude chemical firearms presently sealed in holsters. The large shoulder device is some sort of visual broadcast system. Assume that the device is active and transmitting. Radiation from the device is commensurate with the power supply strapped to the operator. The clothing of the operator is distinctly different from the two armed individuals. Suggest operator is essentially civilian pressed into duty. Uniformity of clothing of the armed individuals suggests military. The deference to the one on the right indicates higher rank."" ""Armed... Not a good sign. Still, they're making no move to draw them. My risk. No one is to show any weapon or take any action even if they discharge a weapon."" ""And if they kill you?"" ""I'll be dead, and in no shape to issue orders."" ### Tyler's Team ""He's a calm one. That's a good sign."" ""Tyler, we're still armed."" ""Good point. I'm going to slowly reach for my belt, and drop the whole thing right here. Carefully. You are to take no hostile action, no matter what they do. Another team might succeed if we fail."" ""Thanks, Ty..."" ""Don't mention it, Gil. Just keep the video running as long as you can."" ""My final piece? Cool. I could live with that!"" ### Pilot (gender-neutral individual indicator) He's moving slowly, no sudden movements, reaching for his harness. ""Hold your actions. He's disarming."" He watches as the leader slowly lowers his weapon harness to the deck. The alien takes the same posture he used when he came out, as he walks toward the pilot. ""Disarmed, and peaceful posture. Do not take any action at all. Scans. Report on other activity."" ""Aircraft that dropped them has moved back but is maintaining observation. Craft is essentially unarmed, although the pilots appear to have similar chemical firearms. Much activity from the impromptu base to the south, several access ways are being driven through the surrounding forest with heavy equipment. No sign of energy weapons of any sort. Many chemical firearms, some of impressive caliber, but they are all concentrated in the base, or in a perimeter approximately five miles from our site. They appear to be primarily concerned with turning civilians away from the area. We have cracked the broadcasts, although we do not understand the language, the visuals are clear. There is a large portion that is behaving in what appears to be irrational anger. That is a subjective judgment. There is a smaller portion who are behaving in what appears to be a reasonable manner, much vocalization over the views the operator is presently providing. Pilot... There are also disturbing videos showing local, apparently civilian, ground craft being destroyed by the military. Those ground craft were seen to attempt to ram their way through a blockade. In more than one case, smaller representatives &amp;mdash; possibly children &amp;mdash; were harmed. They are treated with care and respect, but they were still harmed."" ""What were the larger representatives of the ground vehicles doing?"" ""Operating the vehicle in a manner that *I* would consider foolhardy."" ""Regret for the harm to young innocents. No regret for fools."" ""Understood. And agreed to."" ""I'm about to make contact. Record in full detail."" ### Tyler's Team ""Hey, Ty! My camera has just gone wonky! All I get is static!"" ### Aliens ""Pilot! My scans may be interfering with theirs! Reducing to purely visual scanning."" ### Tyler's Team ""Good! It's cleared up.""

I don't need more reasons for heart attacks!"" ""Mr. President, commentators are suggesting that some sort of powerful scan was used, that interfered with the operation of the camera, and radios for that matter."" ""Jesus. Okay... Get the inner HQ on the line. I'd appreciate it if they would send up more observers, kept at a series of distances from the craft. The idea is to first, see what's going on at a wider view, and second, to try and keep visual contact with our intrepid trio."" ""Mr. President, the inner HQ is already making those adjustments now."" ### Alien Craft ""Pilot, I am detecting more craft of the same nature as the one which dropped them off. They are taking up observation positions at increasing distances. Pilot... Some of them are definitely armed."" ""Has the translation computer made any progress?"" ""Limited. We're having to make guesses to feed into it, along with the video and audio. There are also short segments of otherwise unrelated material that we do not understand at all."" ""Continue work. I will meet the leader."" ### Tyler's Team ""Gil? Good visuals?"" ""Moving to the side, maintaining distance. Good footage. Historic, or is that hysterical, first contact with alien species. CWO Tyler in the lead!"" ### Cal Tech ""***WHO THE HELL IS TYLER!?***"" ### Mainstream Media ""And here it is, James Tyler, Specialist Radar Operator, HEY! That can't be right! He's wearing Chief Warrant Officer rank tabs!"" Off-Screen: ""Confirmed, promoted for this mission."" ### Cal Tech ""***WHY HIM?!?***"" ### Mainstream Media ""Tyler is apparently an excellent observer, with a remarkably good assessment of the aliens. He: Recognized that the craft was not hostile. Recognized that they were about to accelerate and gave the order to get our aircraft out of the way. And provided such good information and advice to the Alpha Flight leader, that he has had several commendations already. Apparently a brilliant young man with a bright future ahead of him!"" ### Tyler's Team ""Dear Lord, please don't let me screw the pooch!"" ""You'd better not, and watch your language, we're on national television."" ""Thanks, Gil, no stress, right?"" ""None at all."" ### Pilot The approach continues, we are now quite close enough to see each other. From the limited visuals I have seen, this would appear to be a young ... male? Yes. Male."
7,cyber crime,HFY,The Gunwright - Chapter 1,37,cc1ha1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/cc1ha1/the_gunwright_chapter_1/,2019-07-12 07:17:59,"Life in the Tower was anything but pleasant. Though I've never been a fan of my brother's line of work, I'm glad his connections got us to the twenty-fifth floor. I was getting sick of working in Agriculture. The Farmers refused to teach their apprentices the fineries of the trade. They worried if we figured out how to run the sunlamps and the hydroponics, we youngbloods would take over their roles. They weren't wrong. Most of us had long grown sick of their verbal and physical abuse. I was glad to be walking the corridors without fear of mugging or attacks. The panelling was as dirty as it was below, solid food was still scarce and plumbing very unreliable. However, with private SyncPods in the family units, there weren't as many suspicious figures waiting for their turn in the communal pod hubs. They were free to make a living in the Cyber Plains, working for the Topfloorsmen, while the rest of us continued balancing our earnings between the physical and digital worlds. Still, I avoided the side alleys. One can never be too careful. On the downside, my travel time was doubled. Maintaining a brisk but inconspicuous space, I told myself not to worry. There had to be reason Maya hadn't logged in, for a while. Trusting her with the Krystals wasn't a mistake, I reassured myself. They were our ticket up. Surely she wouldn't hoard them for herself. Eddie didn't know Maya was my reason for insisting we push for the twenty-fifth floor -- if he did, he didn't show it. Maya was the reason I had savings at all. We had met in the Nursery Plains, and though I was a Single Digit, she'd stuck by my side. Even though she shared the unit's SynchPod with her parents, Maya still managed to schedule her six hours. Often, I paid extra in the hubs so I'd be online in time. I don't remember my parents, it's been just Eddie and me for a very long time. Since he had access to a SynchPod at work, I now had uninterrupted access to the one in our family unit. My focus hasn't changed: hunt low tier beasts, strip them down for parts and bring them back to Maya so can turn it into products for sale. She found an odd pleasure in the Tanning, Alchemy and Carving skills that I never understood. Being a member of the merchant's guild, she got better rates than me and access to the premium bank accounts. Which meant, all our savings were in her care. The closer I got close to Maya's home, the quicker my heartbeat. By the time I got to the metal door, my chest felt like it was going to explode, and my temples throbbed. I didn't know why I was so worried or how my body was reacting in kind. I'd maintained my calm when facing the Great Boar, and when professing my unrequited laugh to Chaya' Bigtits' Lang. I buzzed the intercom and was surprised by the quick answer. The Parsons were notorious for taking their own sweet time with the intercom. It was Maya's mother. I'd last seen two years ago when Maya turned eighteen. The woman had surprised her daughter by buying me a visitor's pass for the evening. Now, she looked at me like I was a stranger. ""Can I help you?"" She asked. Svati Parsons looked alien without her characteristic motherly smile. Instead, the woman wore an almost hostile scowl. I didn't like this version of her. I'd know her since the Nursery Plains, where she often played the role of a surrogate mother. The woman standing before me wasn't the Svati I knew. ""Yes, ma'am,"" I answered. ""I haven't heard from Maya in a week, just wanted to make sure she's okay."" ""I'm afraid you got the wrong apartment, kid. There's no Maya here."" ""You must be mistaken-"" ""Listen, when you meet a girl in a plain, always ask for an ID Code. It's the only way to know you're not being duped."" She moved to activate the door closing mechanism, but I slipped past her. Life as a Single Digit hadn't given me the opportunity to grow very tall or hefty. Svati's annoyance morphed into fear. ""What do you think you're doing? Get out now,"" she hissed. Trying to grab at my jumpsuit collar. ""I'm going to scream."" Years of dodging the Farmers' cane and fleeing with rations from the older boys had made me agile. I had little trouble dancing around the portly woman. The family SynchPod was unoccupied, and everything that said Maya was gone. There were only two chairs around the kitchen receptacle and only two cots in the night room. ""Where's Maya?"" I demanded. She looked more tired than usual, dark circles lined the underside of her eyes. ""Where's Mr Pasons? It's me, Rowe. What's going on, Svati? You can tell me. Please."" ""My husband is at work, but the neighbours are always listening. Get out now, kid. Or I'm going to scream. No harm has been done, I don't want you getting into trouble."" Letting Svati get close to me was a mistake. She went feral once I was in reach. Nails scraped my skin when her hands curled around my neck. Before I could push her off, the once-mother figure jumped onto my stomach, and her weight pushed me to the ground. Svati's eyes were wild and bloodshot. She reminded me of the jaguar I had hunted the week before. It had cornered me and then pounced. If it weren't for the several months I had invested in the Brawling skill, the mutated feline would have been the end of me. I used the same move on her, as I'd used on the jaguar. My legs knees folded under the woman's stomach, I planted my feet against her pelvis and pushed. I thanked the Farmers once again. Their beatings and unreasonable chores had made me strong. Svati's claws scratched my neck when she was thrown free. When Maya's mother didn't come after me again, I took a moment to catch my breath and calm my racing heart. I treasured Svati, I hoped I hadn't killed her. Several minutes passed before I found the courage to check on her. She was a gentle, motherly woman. Svati thought the dream her daughter and I shared of scouring the Cyber Plains for Krystals and recovering humanity's lost knowledge was foolish and much too dangerous. She insisted we find a lucrative trade or job serving a Topfloorsmen - there were plenty of jobs mining, crafting or bookkeeping for them across the digital fields, it was safe and secure. I took a deep breath before checking. There was no blood, and she was breathing. If I got reported, it would be for assault at most. Still, I needed to check the apartment before her husband returned. There had to be some clue of where Maya had gone. I checked the kitchen and around the pod. Maya's effects were all gone. There was not a thread in the family unit that belonged to her. I checked the night room. The sky simulator was still broken, so I relied on the living room's light to see. The wall opposite the two lowered cots was smooth and unmarred. Maya's drawings and sketches were gone. I forced my fingers into the little slit and pulled the retractable bed down. I knew my muscles would complain in the morning, but I didn't care. The bed was made, and the sheets were a dull grey. They weren't Maya's. I sniffed the pillow, it didn't smell of her either. There was no sign of her. I was ready to give up, but first I decided to check the HoloScreen planted in the wall. It loaded into its default state, none of her applications or modifications showed. I browsed the files, they were all blank. It was the default setting. Tears stung my eyes, Maya was gone. Our relationship was platonic, and we didn't harbour any other feelings for one another, but we still joked about getting married someday. Now she was gone. I punched the HoloScreen, and my fist went through. The image distorted around my hand like it were water. I struck the wall, and it hurt, but I hit it again and again, till an errant blow made contact with the projector, and it flashed off. Then, I found my clue. At first, I'd been sure it was the tears distorting things, but then I wiped them away and took a closer look. Letters. No. Words, there were words scratched into the plastic behind the projector. Cme fnd me CP1264 - Golden Scales Maya wasn't gone. I recognised the code, but not the words that accompanied it. I committed them to memory and checked on Svati once again. She was going to be okay - at least physically. After taking a moment to straighten my clothes and hiding the wounds on my neck, I fled. While heading back to the unit I shared with Eddie, I tried not to cough. My throat hurt from Svati's crazed wringing, and the scratches stung. The last thing I wanted was to draw attention from Security. Due to his entrepreneurial line of work, my brother was familiar with the floor's monitoring systems. He claimed the closer one got to the high twenties, more efficient they got. Not all the cameras were for show. On the way to the main corridor that circled the entirety of the floor, I met eyes with Marcus Parsons. He looked as tubby and jolly as ever. However, his eyes were bloodshot, and the bags under them were darker than usual. I always liked Marcus, he wasn't as parental as his wife, but he always treated me well. The man worked hard for his family and wanted to get them into the thirties. He spent eight hours a day in the Cyber Plains and then eight more in hydroponics maintenance. It was time for the midday shift change, and he was on his way home like most labourers. After the encounter with Svati, I wasn't surprised when he didn't recognise me. All I got was a polite nod of acknowledgement, the greeting he offered most strangers. I returned the gesture and hoped the foot traffic was dense enough to end up as another face in the crowd. People rarely went missing in the Tower. It was supposed to be an impossible occurrence. The perpetrators almost always got caught. Before the terrifying encounter, I didn't think memory tampering was a possibility. Surely, if anyone found a Krystal containing the knowledge of such techniques and technology, it would be big news. Keeping it quiet would be a challenge and a half. Due to it being peak traffic hours, my trek home was much shorter. I wasn't afraid of taking detours through the otherwise perilous corridors and gangways. Though the temptation to look over my shoulders was a constant, I resisted. In the Tower, those looking for a tail would eventually find one. Paranoia was a sign of having something to lose. When passing through the market district, I changed my mind. Maybe going home wasn't the smartest thing. What if I was seen? What if Svati and her husband used my name to track me down or set whatever force had taken Maya on me? If anyone could help me find my dearest friend, it would be the Spider. The inhabitants of the floor didn't fear the Spider's Alley out of fear of getting mugged or murdered. They avoided it because Security's employees knew what went on in there but never reported its existence. Eddie could probably tell me whether he bought their silence or they were too scared to move against the Spider. However, in an attempt to distance myself from his world as much as possible, I never asked. The rotund guard at the alley's mouth was too well dressed for an ordinary thug, even though he was just that. He carried a portable HoloScreen and anyone that needed to pass got looked up. However, when I approached Spider's Alley, he only smiled. The man's teeth were too perfect for someone in his line of work. I'd seen him take a pipe to the face for Eddie, but somehow his nose wasn't crooked, and he didn't have any missing teeth. As expected, he didn't stop my advance when I approached him. Instead, he nodded and stepped aside so I wouldn't have to squeeze past his giant shoulders like the other visitors. I returned the courtesy. No matter their rank and attitude, always be friendly to anyone bigger than you - Eddie's lesson had gotten me out of countless scuffles over the years. None of his subordinates checked me for hidden weapons and recording devices, even though most of them had never met me before. Unlike most of the back alleys on the floor, the one that led to the Spider's Lair was immaculate. The floors were stain free, and there were no scratches or dents on the walls. Every door looked precisely the same as every other door, and there was not a vagrant in sight. When I knocked, the metal shutter slid up without a moment's delay. Walking into the waiting room, I was welcomed by dozens of tired eyes. Most had to make appointments to get past the door, let alone visit with the only Spider's Leg within five floors. The scantily clad woman that rarely smiled welcomed me with an ear to ear grin. ""He's been expecting you,"" she said. ""Of course he has."" I had to resist shaking my head. ""Is there much of a wait?"" ""For you, love? As long as I'm on duty, never."" In front of the room full of people, she pressed up against me, and I felt her heavy breath on my neck. ""Maybe this time I'll get a thank you?"" ""We'll have to push that back to my next visit, Ariana."" Her touch always sent shivers down my spine, and she knew it. The young woman's alabaster skin was flawless, unlike most other addicts I knew. It was the pink eyes and the occasional hand tremor that gave Ariana away. I was sure it was Eddie that put her up to it, he claimed I needed to spend some time with a real woman instead of an avatar. I disagreed. I had heard enough horror stories regarding the Tower's faulty birth control and the penalties for unsanctioned pregnancies. ""That's unfortunate,"" Ariana stated through pouted lips. She returned to her desk against the wall and twisted the lever under it. The door behind her slid open, and she waved me through. The Spider's office threw most people. When I visited one for the first time on the sixth floor, I expected to either walk into a grand affair or a dingy torture chamber. The room was neither of the two. It was minimalistic. The floors and walls were bare, and there were only three pieces of furniture in the room: A metal workstation, a high-backed chair and a much better quality SynchPod than the one in the family unit. An hour passed before the cylinder hissed releasing the pressure trapped within. The metal cover slid apart, and Eddie, the Spider's Leg sat up. He stretched and cracked his joints as the pod's viscous contents slid off his skin. My brother's physique had improved since he upgraded to the new immersion unit. It made sense his organisation had invested in it. Eddie spent more time conducting business in the Cyber Plains than he did in the physical world. ""Good morning, brother!"" Eddie smiled swinging his legs out of the SynchPod. He took a moment to orient himself before standing up. His haptic suit clung to his body like a second layer of sin. ""You've been watching me again,"" I replied, choosing not to reciprocate my brother's cheerful greeting. He didn't ask me to evacuate the chair he had worked so hard to earn but claimed the uncomfortable abomination on the other side of the work station. ""You know I don't like it when you've been watching me."" ""Can't a man keep an eye on his beloved little brother? I thought you'd come to me sooner."" ""You know why I'm here?"" ""Of course. I knew something was off when the Parsons showed up in my office requesting a rewrite-"" ""You erased their memories?"" I asked. It was no secret the Spider had access to technology beyond comprehension, but I didn't think tampering with the human mind was possible. I didn't know whether to be impressed or angry about what had become of Svati and her husband. ""How?"" ""It's the SynchPods,"" Eddie answered. ""You've only experienced one avatar death. Am I right?"" I nodded in the affirmative. ""Don't you think it's odd how you bounced back from it so quick? You recall the death, but do you remember any of the sensations?"" ""I still have the death sequence saved in my video logs-"" ""Exactly! You saw it in the video logs! If you remembered the pain and trauma of being gored by a giant boar, you would be too terrified to go back to it. The SynchPod wipes away memories of death and traumatic events. One of the Eyes found a Krystal that lets us manipulate that."" ""Wait, does that mean you can tamper with anyone's memories?"" ""No,"" he said. I was sure he looked disappointed. ""We need their verbal and biometric consent, and access to the pods used for long term medical stasis."" ""How long ago was this?"" ""A couple of days ago."" ""And you didn't think to tell me?"" I demanded. If there were anything but the inbuilt HoloScreen on his workstation, I would've thrown it at Eddie. ""You know how important Maya is to me! I was worried, sick."" ""Just because I'm a Spider's Leg doesn't mean I'm free to do whatever I want, Rowe. I figured you'd eventually come to me. There is only so far you can go on your own."" ""How can you be so calm about this, Maya's gone! All I've got is a Plain ID Code and a meaningless word! What the fuck happened to her, Eddie?"" ""I don't know. Her folks wouldn't say, but it's probably the same reason why most people on the lower floors go missing. They chance upon a precious Krystal and forget to hide their personal pod number when showing it off. I imagine someone tried to coerce Maya to sell it, but she used it instead. So, they looked up the SynchPod's location, synched it with her avatar data, and then snatched her to extract the data packet."" Eddie's explanation terrified me. I pictured Maya shackled to a wall while inked thugs tortured her. ""If that's the case I'm surprised she managed to leave behind a message at all. What did it say?"" ""CP1264. Golden Scales."" ""Give up, brother,"" Eddie said almost instantly. ""I don't want you anywhere near there."" ""Why the hell not? I've read workers are in high demand and the Topfloorsmen pay exceptionally well up there!"" ""That's because it's dangerous,"" my brother said. ""The SynchRate for the world is astonishingly high. The pods struggle to draw a boundary between what's digital and real. People that die in Intemus either wakeup damaged or never at all."" ""But I have to find Maya. If you want me to survive, you're going to help me with a character transfer. Or I'm going in with a basic avatar, and starting from nil."" ""That won't be possible, Rowe. The world doesn't allow complete transfers."" ""I can put up with some randomisation."" ""Fine,"" he said after an entire minute of staring me down. I was glad to have won the staring contest. My brother knew better than to test my resolve when Maya was concerned. She was more important to me than he. The harsh realisation had come at a very young age, but he never put me down for it. Instead, he encouraged me to spend time with her and pursue my dreams. Though almost as dangerous as organised crime, Krystal Hunting had lower mortality rates. ""I'm going to have to keep an eye on you though, and you're going to do this my way. Running around the woods with a piece of shit bow and an old axe isn't going to help you get close to the Golden Scales. They're a merchant guild."" ""Can't you get me in?"" ""Not without getting you on the organisation's radar. You'll either have to get yourself noticed and then earn their trust yourself."" ""But that will take forever,"" I protested. ""There has to be something you can do!"" ""I'll try to get you a skill boost. You'll want to pursue an Artisan Mastery or Merchantcraft. Probably the former, the latter needs capital you don't have."" ""Anything, I need to find Maya."" ""Very well, anything else you need, brother?"" Eddie sighed. He reached over the workstation and rotated the HoloScreen. He powered up applications I had never seen before. Their rough UI suggested they weren't official design but homebrewed. ""Maybe an hour with Ariana while I make a few calls and make arrangements?"" ""Yes. I need to move to a different floor. Maybe, change my identification code too."" ""What did you do? Assault Maya's parents."" ""Just her mother,"" I replied. Eddie's glared at me with an expression somewhere between horrified and impressed. &amp;#x200B; \----------------------- [Home Page](URL [Royal Road](URL [Chapter 2](URL"

He didn't give off a particularly intimidating air either. What set him apart was his skill with HoloScreen App design and modification. As a rule, we kept our worlds apart. We rarely saw each other in the family unit, very infrequently in a professional setting and rarely in the Cyber Plains. On a rare occasion, I saw him work. He never failed to impress me. If not for security's intense defensive and monitoring systems, Eddie would have run of the Tower. ""I'd rather maintain a low profile,"" he said when I reminded him of his potential. He already had a uHolo - I'd rarely see him use the underskin HoloScreen - and a bicep jack to connect at any access point. Being a Spider's Leg, he'd gotten it via legal means. In spite of his position, his criminal record was squeaky clean. ""But you could be one of the top dogs if you worked for Security-"" ""We're not going to have this discussion again, Rowan."" The only time he didn't call me Rowe was when he was serious. So, I decided to hold my tongue. ""You don't get the gravity of the situation, do you? This is going to be nothing like the worlds you and Maya had your tea parties in. This is the real deal. No UI or levels. There are barely stats or over-powered skills. You're going to be on level ground with everyone else. No matter how good you get, someone with a better SynchRate could come along and make light work of you. I don't want you ending up a vegetable. Do you hear me?"" ""I hear you, Eddie. Thank you for doing this. You have no idea how much this means to me."" ""Believe me, I do. Otherwise, I wouldn't be risking our necks for this. You better find a way to pay the Spider off quick. The organisation won't care, you're my brother if you're late."" ""Fine, fine. Tell me more about the system."" ""In place of menus and screens, you'll get a Codex,"" my brother explained. He wove his hand through the HoloScreen and the image enlarged. ""That's just a journal,"" I commented, slightly confused. The book floating in front of me looked old and battered. Pages were hanging off the binding, and more than one was stained. ""No screens. No menus,"" Eddie repeated. ""The Codex is everything. It will log your quests, your skills and stats-"" ""I thought you said there weren't any stats."" ""No, I said there are barely any stats. The usual eight are condensed into four. Ranking your skills will get you coins, and then you use said coins to rank up the respective attribute. It's simple, but the world has no hand-holding, or guides. You'll have to figure out almost everything out on your own."" ""Wait. I'll have to upgrade my stats with physical coins? Could someone steal them from me?"" ""Of course. Power and Finesse coins can be sold for several Gold. The price for Presence and Arcane can shoot up to the Platinums. There are quite a few unsavoury types - yes, more unsavoury than me, that make a living out of stealing coins. Most try not to hoard them and use or trade them straight away. I prefer hiding mine."" ""Why would anyone need to hoard them?"" I asked it was all too much to take in. I thought Intemus would be the same as Beast Hunter's Realms, but the differences were quickly adding up. ""Just use them straight away."" ""Because the higher the statistic is, the more coins you need to upgrade it,"" Eddie answered. ""Don't worry about it too much. You can't surpass the human limit, after getting to five you'd only be upgrading for the sake of high tier perks. Your focus needs to be the skills. Just remember: it is important to rank up skills that pair well together to combine them into a mastery. Don't worry much about that. I think some of your current skills will transfer over. It will give you a headstart."" If I were brave enough to go for the top tier transfer, I could've gotten more out of my old avatar, but the one hundred platinum debt was enough already. What hurt the most about the partial transfer was my Arcane talents were reset. I was by no means a Mage but had a simple Ember spell for the long hunts. It made lighting campfires a breeze and did an excellent job of blinding attackers when aimed right. On rare occasions, I had used it to set my arrows ablaze as well. I'd been hoping to use it to get a headstart in blacksmithing. I always fancied playing with metal but never had the time. Hunting for beasts and Krystals forever took priority. ""It wouldn't matter,"" Eddie said when I voiced my concern. ""The magic system in the higher worlds is pretty limited in comparison to the ones you've been using. You don't get to choose your affinity. Let's just hope your high rank in Ember gives you access to the School of Thermomancy."" My brother fell silent, and his brows furrowed. I could see the gears shifting in his head. Some realisation had just hit him. ""If Maya left you a message, it means she knew where she was going to be taken. It's got to be because of Dominion Magic."" ""What the fuck is that?"" I asked, not liking his tone. ""Mind Magic. Telepathy, telekinesis, empathy, illusion projection, the whole shebang. It's the purest method of extraction. We don't use it though. It's much too dangerous. Security has wards in place to enable players to block or report nonconsensual mind melds. Be ready for the possibility of Maya having followed them willingly."" ""That can't be right!"" I protested. ""Rowe, think about it. Maybe they threatened her parents' lives. Or yours."" ""So why didn't she just give them the knowledge?"" ""They want a full extraction, not just her interpretation of it,"" Eddie explained. ""You won't get it till you've used a Krystal. The extraction is going to take time. It's not all bad news, though. It means they have to keep her body safe and locked in a Premium SynchPod. It implants a vitals reader in the user. So, they can't hurt her real body. It will alert security straight away."" ""Why didn't you tell me all of this before?"" I demanded. Eddie had a bad habit of holding back information. I'd always hated it. ""I specialise in trade,"" he replied. ""This isn't my department, brother. It might sound like I know a lot, but these are just theories. My knowledge only scratches the surface. Believe me. There are things the organisation and Topfloorsmens do that even I can't stomach."" Much to my disappointment, the system wouldn't divulge my avatar's information till the character transfer was complete, and I logged in. Eddie said Intemus was a living entity in itself and preferred keeping private. While we worked, Arianna proved to be a giant distraction after she'd cleared the waiting room. As attractive as she was, I didn't trust her not to carry diseases or slip me something during a kiss. My brother waited till he stopped finding her attempts at seducing me funny before dismissing her. Even if she wasn't an addict, I didn't want to waste time on her and the risk of bedding her even less. My focus was still Maya. Eddie often said she and I would end up marrying someday, but I didn't think it a possibility. We'd thought about it and had given it a shot - just to find out what sex felt like in reality. It'd been a lot of fun, but we both knew too much about one another for things to get romantic. It was only after the little tryst we had learnt our relationship was much too sibling-like, so it stayed that way. ""Your new unit will be on floor thirty."" ""Won't Security have too many eyes there?"" I asked. ""She will,"" Eddie said, flashing his perfect teeth. ""You'll be living right under her nose. It's a good thing we came up here on fake papers. If the Parsons do report you, security will look for you where her presence is sparse, not where it's heavy. Besides, if Maya's kidnappers get wind of you, getting to you will be harder the higher you go."" Eddied scanned all my digits into the system. Only the rich and powerful bothered with biometrics. We didn't have enough to protect on the lower floors. More importantly, security had access to the records. Most of us preferred staying off her books. One can never know when crime becomes a necessity. ""Just to be safe, I've scrubbed your identity. You're still Rowan but one of a few thousand. Just be sure not to do something that will get you into trouble."" ""That's rich coming from you,"" I remarked. ""I can't make any promises. I don't know what I'll have to do get Maya out."" ""In that case, do your best not to get caught."" The trek up to the thirtieth floor was a short one. The next shift change being several hours away, the line for the elevator going up was much shorter than the one going down. Citizens being evicted to the teens or single digits was a regular occurrence. Stepping onto the lift, I realised I didn't mind leaving all my belongings behind. It wasn't just a case of there not being many, but they meant nothing to me if I didn't have Maya to share them with. Travelling upwards, I caught myself wondering what Maya could've found. The nursery and the hunting worlds were mostly picked clean. They were still populated for the entertainment of the Topfloorsmen. Several guilds were hunting for hidden Krystals, but the majority were more interested in testing out the contents of already-found data packets. They needed folk like us to do the grunt work. It was how most of us made a living. She'd always been the smarter of the two of us. It must have something useful for her to have absorbed the Krystal straight away. Floor thirty may as well have been an entirely different world. The plumbing wasn't visible, and none of the metal panelling was missing. Most surprising of all was how only a handful didn't have a uHolo on display. Pulling my sleeves down, I made a mental note to invest in one as soon as I could afford it. Though I intended to stay in the SynchPod most of the time, standing out in the Tower was never a good idea. Walking down the corridors, I noted the ceiling cameras and passive scanners. Their frequency was much higher than what I was used to. I let myself be seen in the hopes Mrs Parsons didn't remember my name. Or even if she did, Rowe was far enough from Rowan for Security not connect the two. My heartbeat didn't calm till I was in the security of my unit. Eddie had warned me it was going to be simple. Bachelors didn't need much space. There was no room for a cot, but I was happy to see a fold-out table and chair next to the food processing station. For hygiene reasons, the toilet was in a separate cubicle and had its sink. However, there was no shower. The mid-tier SynchPod was enough to keep me clean, but if I wanted a proper wash down, I'd need to find out where the communal showers were. I only did a quick check of the room to make sure there was no one hiding in wait for me - I don't know why anyone would, but Eddie taught me: paranoia keeps you alive. Once satisfied, I stripped into my birthday suit, let the SynchPod scan my biometrics and jumped in. Intemus was waiting. Once upon a time, Maya and I had spent hours on avatar design. This time around, I didn't waste more than a few minutes on the luxury. I left the facial structure as is - it was important Maya recognise me. At the same time, I wanted to make life difficult for her captors. So, I made the avatar's skin several shades darker and the hair black, no different from Maya's. I reset the height to match mine in reality. Adjusting to the difference had always been disorienting when transitioning, but I'd stuck to it in the Beast Hunter Realm's for vanity's sake. When I tried to progress to race selection, the system skipped to Ancestry. I went back and forth several times, but I failed to find what I was looking for. ""System, take me to race selection,"" I said. ""Intemus lore only features humanity. There are no other races."" Disappointed, I perused the ancestries. Avatar models in different outfits stood in front of me. Pausing in front of one displayed their name, a small description, and the bonuses and penalties that came with them. The names were mostly tied to topography, and it caused me concern. ""Will my selection limit me to my ancestral birthplace?"" ""No,"" the robotic voice answered. ""However, your heritage will determine how others view you. You may not start in hostile territory. You will be advised to start where your people are most welcome. Planting your avatar in a war zone or contested territory is not allowed but unadvised."" ""Interesting,"" I mumbled to myself. There were too many to choose from. There were purebreds and mixed parentage. I didn't have time to browse the entire list. ""System, filter ancestries with bonuses in at least two of the following skill groups marksmanship, sneaking, crafting and trading."" The selection shrank from over a hundred to two dozen. Still too much. ""Eliminate anyone, not on positive terms with the Golden Scales guild."" ""Invalid search parameters,"" the system announced. ""Fine. Scan for settlements where the Golden Scales guild has an outpost and then eliminate all ancestries that have a negative reputation in the said settlement."" ""Negative reputation includes dislike. Hostility is much further down the spectrum. You will be excluding ancestries that have skill bonuses in three or more of your listed skills."" ""Just do what I say,"" I said, ignoring the warning. Eddie claimed social status was vital to merchant guilds. I didn't want to waste time trying to improve my reputation. The cyber plains were home to digitised folk and the cyber born. They were as real as Maya and I, and real people were slow to change their mind. ""I need ancestries that are welcome wherever the Golden Scales are."" ""Confirmed."" The system took much longer than I thought it would. One by one, the options decreased till there were four left. ""Your parameters were impossible. Someone will always find a reason to hate another. The following are disliked by only five per cent of the population in all settlements featuring a Golden Scales outpost."" ""Thank you."" ***Dunesmen:*** *Several thousands of years of walking the sands and practising guerilla warfare has made your kind lightfooted and used to the shadows. Resources being scarce, many will go against the law to get what they need.* * *Stealth, Marksmanship, Thieving, and Acrobatic skills gain experience at a higher rate.* * *High chance of birth with Void or Shaping Attunement.* * *Viewed suspiciously in non-desert settlements, but held in high regard by all mercenaries.* * *Experience penalties with Heavy Armour and Heavy Weapon skills.* ***Mountainfolk:*** *Your people live in a harsh environment but love it. They don't like moving far from their birthplace or mingling with outsiders. However, the steep slopes have made them nimble, and their isolation has taught them the importance of providing for themselves.* * *Gathering, Marksmanship, Traversal and Taming skills gain experience at a higher rate.* * *High chance of birth with Thermomancy or Essence Attunement.* * *Viewed as primitive folk in non-mountainous settlements and larger cities, but easily trusted.* * *Experience penalties with offensive spells and Weapon skills (except Simple Weapons)* ***Plainsmen:*** *Your ancestors were people of the land. They preferred nurturing it and domesticating its dwellers as opposed to conquesting for territory. Like them, you love people, creation, trade and hunting.* * *Crafting, Gathering, Trading, Marksmanship and Taming skills gain experience at a higher rate.* * *High chance of birth with Dominion or Essence Attunement.* * *Loved by all but excluded from military and mercenary forces.* * *Experience penalties with all offensive spells and Melee Combat Skills.* ***Channelsmen:*** *Your ancestors were born on islands off the mainland but didn't let them become isolated. They navigated rough and calm waters for the sake of trade, exploration, and knowledge. You were born to learn, create and make money.* * *Crafting, Trading, Navigating, and Arcane skills gain experience at a higher rate.* * *High chance of birth with Thermomancy or Primal Attunement.* * *Liked by most but often mistaken as Imperialists.* * *Experience penalties with all melee Martial and Exotic Weapon and Gathering skills.* I eliminated Dunesmen straight away. Though thieving sounded like a fun route to take, I didn't want to risk the societal negative. Mountainfolk were next to go. I imagined Traversal skills included sneaking, but the lack of Crafting bonus and the risk of being considered stupid was a negative. ""Select Plainsmen,"" I said. My avatar's complexion smoothed and what had been naturally dark skin, now looked more tanned. He looked like me but more relaxed than I'd ever been. From appearance alone, he was likeable. I could see myself becoming a prosperous merchant as him. ""What's this?"" I asked when the next selection process started. My avatar and I stood shoulder to shoulder in a room lined with countless spheres. There words in varying scripts engraved on their surface. ""This is where you build your avatar's backstory. The traits you select will modify your bonuses and penalties. Some may handicap you in some respect while giving you a supreme advantage elsewhere."" ""How many do I get?"" ""Six,"" the system answered. ""You pick three, then I pick three."" ""Pick all six for me, I'm in a rush."" ""Request denied. The rules are set. You must pick three."" ""I've wasted too long on avatar creation already!"" I complained. However, the rules had to be obeyed. ""You've got to help me narrow the selection down."" ""Request granted,"" the system said, and the majority of the balls turned black. ""Traits that don't pair well with your previous parameters have been dulled. Do note: due to the time dilation only two minutes have passed since synchronisation with the pod."" The first to grab my attention was Apprentice. *You're talented and hardworking enough to have found a master in your chosen craft. Experience gain in selected profession increased by 25%. Related skills will start at the Apprentice rank. Your master will be assigned randomly.* Several choices of profession drifted in front of me. It wasn't only related to crafting, but there were diplomatic and combat-related professions too. Apprentice Salesman was an amusing option, but I moved it to the rejected pile. Only alchemist, artificer and blacksmith remained by the time I was done eliminating the unsuitable options. Unsure how lucrative the first craft was in Intemus, I dismissed it. After some thought I decided, the second was bound to be too expensive to rank quickly, so I settled on blacksmithing. The system was kind enough to darken more options when I locked in my choice. However, I was determined to get it all done, sticking to the shelves closest to me. The ball labelled 'Adopted' caught my attention. *Nurture is as important as nurture. Brought up by a parent or parents of a different ancestry, you have assimilated their interests and nature. You will inherit two skill growth bonuses from your adopted parent. A fraction of their reputation bonuses and penalties will be added to yours as well.* ""System, do I get to choose which skill bonuses I will inherit?"" ""No. However, the ancestral skill bonuses do not stack. If your adopted parent is one of the Mountainfolk, you won't receive further bonuses in Gathering, Taming or Marksmanship. Only Traversal will be added to the bonuses. All weapon skill penalties will be added too."" ""Excellent,"" I said. ""Make my avatar a Channelsmen adopted by Plainsmen."" ""Request completed,"" the system said, and the avatar's physique changed. The smooth complexion turned rough from its exposure to the sea, the shoulders grew more full and the arms longer. The skin was now more sunburnt than tanned. ""Lastly, is there any trait that reduces the likelihood of my Channelsmen being mistaken for an Imperialist. Or, increases his likability."" One of the formerly black balls lit up, and the rest dulled. It was labelled: Abandoned. *Sympathy isn't always a bad thing. While in the settlement you grew up in, you're liked by all, more so by those in your neighbourhood. After all, it takes a village to raise a child. However, your lack of birth papers may be a hindrance.* *Combination effect with Adopted: You will inherit an extra skill and reputation bonus from your adoptive parents. However, all penalties are doubled.* *Tip: Be sure to get a copy of your adoption certificate.* ""It's perfect,"" I said, finalising my selection. I didn't have any use for Taming, but the guarantee of inheriting Marksmanship and Trade skill bonuses was worth more to me than the extra likability. ""Now show me what you're picking."" ""You may view my selections through your Codex once in Intemus."" ""Fine. That means I get to start now?"" ""No. Starting location and name selection are still left."" ""What city is the Golden Scales headquarter in?"" I asked. ""The cloud city of Nimbus,"" the system answered. The scenery changed once again. My avatar and I were now standing on a cloud looking at a cluster of floating islands. It looked like the city had been born on top of the flat rock face and then spilt over the sides. Buildings not only clung to the grey rock face but hung from it as well. The city's rim was one giant port. There were docked sky ships occupying most of it. I watched some depart and others waiting for a spot to tether. It was a wondrous sight. The variety of vehicles left me wondering about the world's magic and crafting systems. Wooden rectangles were dangling from massive balloons, with propellers lashed to their sides. A good fraction of the ships looked no different from ones you'd see on the ocean but had horizontal sails in addition to the vertical one. Most intriguing of all were the complex aerodynamic structures with no visible propulsion. I guessed they used Arcanic means to stay afloat. ""I can't think of a more perfect city for a merchant's guild. What's the manufacturing and military scene like?"" ""Nimbus runs on trade and manufacturing. There is a constabulary serving the council of guilds that run the city, but it doesn't have its own military. Instead, the guilds have their own defence force or employ mercenaries to defend the city from pirates and sky beasts. It serves as a transit hub too. A significant fraction of the population makes a living restocking ships on long voyages and catering to sailors and deckhands-"" ""That's enough,"" I interrupted. ""I don't need a breakdown of their economy. What happens next?"" ""I select the final background traits to formulate your avatar's back story,"" the system explained. ""And, you pick your avatar's name."" ""Make your selection then, what are you waiting for?"" ""It is done. I was waiting for you to confirm your starting location. What would you like to name your avatar?"" My now-dead avatar was named Rowan Parsons, while Maya's had been Madhu Maya - she'd adopted my late mother's last name. However, I needed something different for my new journey. ""Rowe Kross."" Eddie employed the last name for professional reasons. Hicks wasn't threatening enough, and it tied us together. ""Your character background will judge your last name. You may only select the first."" ""Fine,"" I said. Something inside me wanted to employ the 'kay' sound still. My avatar looked like he should have it in his name. ""Let's go with Krowe then."" ""Unconventional but suitable. Avatar creation is complete. Commencing dive in five. Four. Three. Two."" I didn't hear her finish her countdown before the world went black. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \---------------- [Chapter 1](URL [Home](URL [Royal Road](URL"
9,cyber crime,HFY,What did you do? (Part 3),46,bm8n1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/bm8n1p/what_did_you_do_part_3/,2019-05-09 04:10:32,"S'Agat-Y'Ross Void Region, Greet Asteroid Mine, Unnamed M-Type Asteroid. Galactic Standard Date: 34221.42 \[2219AD\] Galactic Standard Time: 21.6 \[1800\] It took three long range jumps for The Hammer of Doom to reach the last known location of the contact Jai Yimbo-Yahoanz knew. They had to spend several rotations waiting for the jump drive to charge in between each jump, time Seth Tanner spent on a regime of exercise and rest punctuated by socialising with various crew members. His main focus was maintaining combat readiness in lieu of tactical input. They eventually reached a metallic asteroid that had been thoroughly mined by Greet mineral harvesters and had been abandoned in a vacant region of space. Once they were within visual range of their destination he pressed Captain Eea for more information. ""So who is this guy?"" asked Seth. Captain Eea was perturbed at being interrupted whilst perusing the read-out on her command console. ""I do not have time to explain the details of our current target crewmember."" After a few moments that would have been silent if Seth had not been drumming his fingers on the top of the command console he thoughtfully announced: ""I have another question... well, more of an observation."" Captain Eea snorted in irritation. ""My patience has run out!"" ""I was just thinking... the Greet use pre-fabricated mining rigs."" ""They do. Why mention it?"" ""If they were still operating we'd see activity and if they're done then there should be nothing but rock. So why is there still a facility here? The Greet would've packed up the pre-fabs and wouldn't have left so much useful material go to waste."" Captain Eea's expression went from irritated to puzzled to worried. She activated the ship's intercom and summoned Kazaa for a security consultation. The conclusion of said consultation was that a small scout drone should be sent in. However, there was a problem. ""We do not have any ssscout dronesss,"" Kazaa bemoaned. ""We don't have any scout drones,"" Seth repeated flatly. ""Does that mean we have to send someone in?"" They both looked at him and Seth realised what they were thinking. ""Oh HELL no. I'm not walking into a trap."" ""You are a Human. How much harm could you come to?"" ""Are you shitting me? I could be caught in crossfire, it could be rigged to explode, it could be structually unstable, the atmosphere could be toxic, the power core could spontaneously lose containment..."" ""I understand your reluctance,"" Captain Eea interrupted. ""But it is still less risky for you than it is for anyone else."" Seth sighed heavily. "" What about some kind of protection from the Kill-X in case there's any around? I might be able to tolerate it but I'm not immune."" ""If you keep your helmet on it should not present you with a problem."" A cat-faced crew member with cybernetic implants approached the captain and spoke what Seth recognised as Jom'Joppa, the common language of the Jom'Ha. ""Hauptaan ouf hab unerwarten energeeagnaturen mon der boaia entdoc. Energeabaarmungen, tarnaachild und mauraaeedene energaaellen emuaaun."" The captain turned to the cat-person. ""Aua aoll taot aaen. Oder mumindaa heruntergefahren."" She turned back to Seth. ""It seems as though there are some suspicious energy readings coming from our destination so your theory may be more than plausible."" ""Well I ain't walking into a fucking trap so you're gonna have to come up with a better plan."" Captain Eea poured over the command console and Seth peered over her shoulder. He saw a 3D schematic of the asteroid mine amongst the myriad data. ""Oh fuck. I can't believe I'm suggesting this but I think I have an idea."" They looked at him expectantly. Reluctantly he elaborated: ""If I get my suit pressurised and install a rebreather system, I could infiltrate the facility undetected by dropping in like an orbital drop shock trooper"". Kazaa looked confused. ""I underssstood all of thossse wordsss but I do not know what thhey mean."" ""Which bit didn't you get?"" ""I know what an exo-sssuit isss and thhhe need for ressspiratory sssupport but what is a 'orbitaldropssshocktrooper'?"" ""Really? I'm surprised you haven't heard of them. Orbital-Drop Shock-Troopers are a special operations unit who're dropped to the surface of a world in purpose built exo-suits that allow them to conduct a variety of missions against targets that normal landing forces can't approach undetected."" ""Isss that like an individual troop-lander?"" ""I suppose it's pretty similar."" ""Thhhat sssoundsss dangerousss!"" ""Only if I fuck it up,"" Seth said nonchalantly. ""Anyone planning an ambush would be expecting a ship and they have likely detected us already but an individual in an exo-suit could infiltrate the facility undetected,"" Captain Eea mused. That is how Seth found himself standing in front of the cargo bay doors wearing hastily insulated body armour with a rebreather device attached to his helmet, waiting to be expelled out into space. ""Are y'sure you calculated the trajectory right?"" he asked anxiously. ""Your trajectory has been calculated and confirmed by an analytical program,"" replied Rowinoak, applying flexible poly-sealant along the joins in his suit. ""You guys expect me to trust a computer?"" ""Yes we do. Your suit is now sealed and pressurised. Be careful out there."" Rowinoak left the cargo hold with relative swiftness for a lumbering tree-person and Seth checked his equipment was secured. He had added a couple of kinetic pulse pistols; they wouldn't do much to anyone class 8 or above but they would give a class 7 a bad time and seriously wound anyone class 6 or below. He took his machete with him too. Various crewmembers had looked uncomfortable with that but no-one had tried to take it from him. After a long, tense interval, a klaxon blared and the cargo bay door snapped open. Seth was violently expelled into space with a sickening wrench followed by the nausea of weightlessness, which caused Seth to reassess the location of his internal organs. Once he had determined that they were in fact still inside him he took his bearings and was shocked to find that his incredibly stupid plan was working. All around him was endless black void, but directly ahead was a small grey speck growing larger and more distinct. His target destination approached rapidly and he activated the suit's stabilising impulsors to keep him on course and slow his speed. He could now make out the fissure they had chosen as his landing zone, a thin crack on the far side from the main excavation works. The target was getting closer, no signs of life. He fired the forward facing impulsors to slow his speed and, almost delicately, landed with the fissure. He activated the illumination bar on his helmet and crawled deeper into the crevice. It was a narrow passage that he was forced to squeeze through, his suit snagging on the uneven walls as he pushed and twisted like an oyster knife. Eventually the crack opened onto a wider passage that bore the hallmarks of being made by a large mining laser. Seth deactivated his light bar and waited until he was certain no one was patrolling this tunnel before he emerged. In the low light he silently felt his way along the tunnel with the confidence that, given the size of the main excavation, he would eventually find the source of the suspicious energy readings. What he found first, however, was a mass grave. The crude pit with a mesh of pipes and scaffolding over the top of it looked out of place compared to the smooth tunnels and organised structure of the rest of the mine. Once the eye was drawn to the jumbled mess it noticed the scorch marks around the edge; further examination identified burnt out husks of Greet workers piled up inside. Seth peered through the rudimentary bars at the unfortunate Greet. Greet were tough as tanks: able to survive in space without exo-suits and hibernate for cycles to conserve nutrients, but plasma burns hot and all that remained were the hollow 20 foot long exoskeletons, warped by pain and fire. Seth was filled with revulsion, both for the horrific sight he beheld and heinous crime that had occured. Someone had apparently rounded up all the Greet, trapped them in a hole and burned them alive. The fires of rage began to simmer in Seth's gut. He drew one of the kinetic pulse pistols and advanced with it ready in a tactical stance. Someone was going to pay. The tunnels were wider in this area and had grav-plating and reinforcement beams. Glo-strips lit the corridor and the vibration of activity was just about detectable through the metal infrastructure. Seth saw the shadows move and ducked into an alcove as two figures shuffled around the corner. They were wearing much repaired exo-suits criss-crossed with bandoliers, and carried plasma rifles. Seth could see their features through their faceplates: Reneek, a class 7 rodential race that survived by raiding underdefended colonies and merchant ships. Seth waited for them to pass then drew his machete and moved quickly. One hard thrust drove the machete through the helmet of the exo-suit of the left hand Reneek and out through the faceplate. The right hand Reneek was neutralised by point blank shots from a kinetic pulse pistol. The first two were deflected by the helmet but the next five were enough to render the Reneek unconscious. A further two shots ensured it would never regain consciousness. Seth stealthily glanced around the corner and saw what was apparently the main excavation. The Greet had carved out a huge cavern and parked their ship inside the asteroid, conveyer belts stretched in all directions and had at one point carried material into said ship for processing, but now they were inert. Parts of the ship had been cannibalised to make some kind of oversized chemistry set that was laid out near the prow of the ship. There were numerous armed Reneek around this area, a second glance suggested about 20 mercenaries plus two mech-suited entities. None of them were looking in his direction. In the same way that drifting clouds can form the shape of a dragon or a fish, the glimpse he had gotten of the rear of the ship looked like it had been badly modified. A further third glance confirmed that it looked like the engines had been modified to power a large laser emitter. Further reconnaissance was necessary. Seth holstered his weapons and slipped into the shadows. Moving like a darker patch of darkness he darted from cover to cover, between slag heaps, mining equipment and cargo containers. Very soon he reached one of the stanchions supporting the Greet vessel, from here he could see two crudely constructed shuttle pods that had attached themselves to the dorsal section of the ship/processing centre. He climbed up the stanchion and into the exposed port for the ship landing gear with the lithe agility of an ascended ape and searched for the nearest data-terminal. What it told him was disturbing: the standard mineral processing system had been shutdown and power was being diverted to an ancillary weapons system. He could only presume this was something the interlopers had brought with them. He ventured further into the huge cylindrical corridors of the ship and blundered right into a group of four Reneek in expensive looking exo-suits. Quick as a flash his blade zig-zagged, bisecting air-hoses, slicing through exo-suits and flesh. He strode onward, leaving death in his wake. The Greet used phermone markings as script so Seth had to rely on supposition and perspicacity to find his way to the command compartment. When he found it, four more Reneek and another entity in an ornate exo-suit were directing the other squads from within the wide space. They didn't see him approach until he stabbed the first Reneek through the torso. The two closest Reneek simultaneously activated their plasma rifles and, thanks to Seths anticipation of this action, he ducked between them and they killed each other with the crossfire. The last Reneek was dispatched by a decapitating swing of Seths machete. Seth squared off with the surviving opponent: Just over 5 feet in lightweight white power armour, intricately decorated with gold filigree and armed with an angular pistol analogue decorated similarly. A Zark! And an Elite caste no less. Seth threw his blade at the Zark's face and whilst it was deflecting the assault, Seth drew his pistols and pumped the triggers until the batteries ran dry. The Zark Elite withstood the barrage with no more than besmirched armour and levelled its gun at where Seth stood. Or rather, where he had been standing a few seconds before he dived to the floor where his blade had landed and then launched himself like a spear towards the Elite. Seth couldn't see its face through its helmet's faceplate and after his blade pierced it to the hilt and the point protruded out the back of its head he wasn't about to examine its expression to see what a surprised Zark looked like. Placing a boot on the head of his fallen foe, Seth tugged the machete free. He perused the command console and was shocked to find that the targeting system of a powerful laser cannon was tracking the Hammer of Doom. If he didn't act quickly they would be destroyed. After attempting to remotely deactivate the laser cannon and finding it locked out, he tried shutting off power only to be blocked by an encryption. In fact all the systems were protected by encryption and Seth was no cyber-tech so he would have to do this the hard way. He roughly broke into the Zark Elite's helmet, revealing its ugly orc face and extracted the communication device. He attached it to his own helmet and his ears were instantly bombarded by ponderous Zark speech and Reneek chatter overlaid with synthesised Zark translation that all segued into human dialect even as Seth listened. Universal Translators. A rare and expensive piece of tech, not usually used by Reneek mercenaries and definitely not favoured by Zark zealots. If the rest of them had similar devices they would hear his words translated into their native tongue, in which case Seth had an idea. ""Shut down weapons systems,"" he announced pompously. There was a pause followed by a query: ""Authorisation code?"" Seth swore mentally, the jig was up before it began. ""How about if I say please?"" The communication channel filled with the babble of voices. ""Intruder alert."" ""Command post compromised."" ""Converge on command post."" ""Bastion 1 holding position."" ""Weapon crew standing by."" ""Team 2 preparing to infiltrate."" ""Team 5 taking up covering position."" ""Advise caution. Enemy unknown."" Seth was being surrounded so he needed to act quickly. First thing he had to do was stop them from coordinating. A quick terminal check confirmed that he wasn't able to shut down communications, Seth started to grin, but he could saturate the communication channel. He discarded his kinetic pulse pistols and picked up a couple of plasma rifles. He pried the discharge valves open so that instead of a concentrated beam the rifle would now dipense a stream of flaming plasma and jogged down the main external access corridor just as the Reneek made their breach: multiple teams entering the access corridor via the main door. ""Fast as the wind, your nemesis has come!"" Seth bellowed into the communications device. ""Shaking the ground with the sound of a thousand guns!"" He swept the plasma rifles back and forth, dousing the corridor with superheated plasma. ""Striking through lines of fire. Straight into hostile land."" Their anguished screams joined his song in dreadful chorus as they burned to death. ""So make your last stand."" &amp;#x200B; A huge mech-suit stomped though the entry port; judging by the symbols stamped on the armour it was a Bastion caste Zark. It carried a heavy kinetic pulse cannon. ""Charging the lines with the force of a powerful wave."" Quick as a shot Seth leapt atop its shoulder plates and roasted its face with both barrels. He felt his skin blister from the proximity. ""Fast as the lightning I will put you in your grave."" The mech crashed to the ground and Seth hopped off, tossing the partially melted rifles aside. ""Whether it be at nightfall."" He hefted the kinetic pulse cannon with straining muscles aided by adrenaline. ""Whether it be at day."" He stepped out of the ship into the laboratory area and aimed at the second mech-suit. ""Slaying all in my way."" The second mech was a walking tank and it would take an anti-tank weapon to kill it. Fortunately Seth had just that sort of weapon and hit it dead on with a 'WWWRTHUMP!' ""Always ahead, as the blitzkrieg rages on.,"" he yelled triumphantly. As the gut-shot mech collapsed to the ground Seth turned the cannon on the rest of the mercenaries who were scrabbling for cover. ""Breaking morale with the sound of blazing guns."" 'WWWRTHUMP! WWWRTHUMP! WWWRTHUMP!' Mercs and their cover vanished in powerful, pulverising cannon blasts. ""Pushing the frontline forth with a tremendous force,"" 'WWWRTHUMP!' Blood mist and rock dust clouded the airless cavern as Seth doled out indescriminate destruction. ""Breaking my foes with unsustainable loss."" 'WWWRTHUMP! WWWRTHUMP!'A few desperate shots gave away the hiding place of a cowering squad. 'WWWRTHUMP!' They were smashed to pieces. &amp;#x200B; ""I am the human elite!"" Seth screamed filled with terrible pride, 'WWWRTHUMP!' ""Born to compete!"" filled with righteous vengeance, 'WWWRTHUMP!' ""Never retreat!"" filled with unbridled fury, 'WWWRTHUMP!' ""Bringing you death!"" filled with violent glee. 'WWWRTHUMP!' ""So take your last breath!"" 'WWWRTHUMP! WWWRTHUMP! WWWRTHUMP!' &amp;#x200B; A warning light began flashing on the side of the cannon and Seth stopped firing. There was no one left to fight anyway; he dumped the heavy gun on the floor. Wait! There was still a threat. The anti-ship weapon at the other end of the ship! He needed to get there quickly. He ejected his kinetic pulse cannons battery onto the floor and walked over to the fallen mech, another Bastion caste by the look of it. He dragged its kinetic pulse cannon over to where the battery lay, it was harder now that he was feeling fatigued. He grabbed the least damaged looking rifle and mentally calculated angles, distances and trejectories then fired the cannon at the battery. The lab equipment that had survived his barrage was destroyed by following explosion which blew Seth out of range of the grav-plating and sent him pin-wheeling along the length of the Greet vessel. There was an improvised platform around the hastily constructed laser array plugged into the propulsion system. On that small space it looked like there were a couple of Reneek and some squat beings in clunky red exo-suits. Of course there were Herald caste Zarks here, no way an Elite would go anywhere without a servile squad of Heralds in attendence. Well, it was immaterial, they were about to die. He aimed the rifle at one of the Zarks and started firing as he reached effective weapons range. ""I will pull the trigger,"" he shouted and with three shots took a Herald Zark down. He landed among them to great consternation. ""Just to see you die,"" he kicked another Zark to the ground and put a smoking hole in its helmet. ""I'll execute you with a sense of pride."" This close it was hard to miss. Headshot. Headshot. ""I'm ticking like a timebomb."" He unsheathed the machete and decapitated one of the Reneek in a single swing. ""No fuse, just guts and gore"". He swatted a Zark gun out of his direction and burned several holes through the wielder's chestplate. ""Initiate the burning of the core."" He smashed his rifle over the head of the last Zark, rupturing the plasma canister and shoved it off the platform. It flailed as it burned. ""I count down to zero, pull the trigger, no parole."" He ran one of the Reneek through with his machete and pounced on the last Zark. ""No mercy!"" He struck its faceplate with his clenched fist. ""No mercy!"" He landed another hammer-like blow and raised his arm for the killing strike. ""No mercy on your soul."" He shattered its visor and left it to asphyxiate on the floor. As he turned to the last Reneek he was surprised when the mercenary dropped its gun and held its hands up. Was it surrendering? A voice came over the comm-channel and was translated into stilted human speech: ""I surrender to you. Please spare my life."" Seth paused; Captain Eea did suggest not killing everyone so he bound its arms with cables torn from the laser array and dragged it back to one of the crude shuttle-pods. The systems were basic and it was simple enough to initiate a launch and negotiate a path out of the cavern with only a few minor dings. Once free of the asteroid he fiddled with the emergency beacon until he got a few blips out of it. This was enough to attract the attention the Hammer of Doom who swept in to pick them up. The captain would have a lot questions for their new friend."

The table was surrounded by clientele. The usual sort that could be found on a Friday night in the shifty parts of town. Business men who had enough of their wives and wanted something new. Professional gamers that were only known by their online usernames. Heavy drinking foreigners that hit the bottle like it was a respirator. Some were all of the above and a little extra. All of them stared down at her, mouths watering in anticipation. She lay there on the table, exposed for the whole world to see. The only thing covering her was fish rolled in rice, up her chest and down her legs in the shape of an H. Her mouth and eyes were as open as the 24-7 geisha house she was in. The front of the house was known for its masterful sushi and supreme women. Synthetic fish in synthetic rice on synthetic flesh. It was the only way Jin, Kin, and Kinkys could even have its business in downtown Neon Tokyo. JKK for short and for advertising. JKK, a good time for a new day. Chopsticks pecked at her flesh like crows, snatching the rolls from all over. She didnt respond, didnt flinch. Theres no way she could, she was retired. But, that doesnt mean her deactivated body couldnt be used for a table, especially one that made men want more of what JKK had to offer. Thankfully, most of the harobots in JKK functioned quite well, and did their job better than any human could dream of or physically accomplish. Of all the harobots, the dead ones always got my attention the most, and I never knew why. They look no different than the active ones. Their ghostly white skin is the same; theres no decay, no smell  unless theres a liquid latex spill from a bullet hole or stab wound or awkward fall. Theyre not as fragile as humans, but that doesn't mean they can take an atomic bomb to the face. Theyre made light enough to pick up and toss around like oversized dolls. Thats what they were made to be as dolls for adults. Angry, reckless, over-emotional, unstable adults. Being head of security is no easy task, and the kind of crowd that comes in doesnt make it any easier. Despite bringing customers like no tomorrow, theres no way we can get personal defence droids. Too easy to hack; same with automated turrets. Theres always stories in office buildings and corporate HQs, even hospitals, where the droids turn on their masters due to some punk kid that knows too much code for his own good. No reason to mess up a half working cog with more wrenches. One of the newer security guards came up to me. I didnt know his name, I didnt bother unless they make it past a week. Most of these guys are nameless to me. For the moment, I thought of him as spider on account of his augmentated spider-like eyes, a cluster of lenses and glowing lights on his steel splashed mug. Sir, Kin would like to see you. He said its urgent. I knew where to go, like how everyone knows Hell is below instead of above. Kins office. The lair of the beast. E Leaving the noodle slurping and pan banging of the front, the back of the house was the same kind of symphony; only a different kind of banging and a different kind of slurping. Pink lights sprayed an indoor sunset that never ended, glowing blue carpet paved the way. I was so used to dim lighting I didnt need augments like Spidernor splicingto see everything like its high noon. I was the only security guard whos clean. Saved money on maintenance. Food was already expensive enough as it is, with the famine and all. The office, down the hall and to the left, as far away from the exit as possible. The walk over there was always the same, lines of doors with muffled kpop and thai edm music screaming away, hiding the moans and groans inside. The only real sounds were from the men in there getting their moneys worth. These rooms never sleep. Theyre either occupied, or being cleaned, or being repaired, or being replaced. Same goes for the girls. The office was a different kind of musical, the kind I can enjoy. The torn and ruined harobot hanging above the desk was a curtain waiting to close the show that never ends. She was one of the first girls when the place first opened, now reduced to a mess of wires attached to the spinal mainframe, limbs turned into those of a chandelier with neon lights running along the arms and legs, glowing brightest at the fingers and toes. The room had the taste and tone of an aquarium, the octagon window showing the dark depths of the outside world. It was raining, and we were drowning. Kin was waiting for me as patient as a man about to get a lethal injection, and he was as outdated as one too. He was from a past nobody knew with a style nobodys heard of. Bright green shirt with purple palm trees, gold bracelets wrapped over his arms like unintentional bracers, and rarely combed hair as big and white as the pile of pure pixel he had sitting on his desk. The only reason it was still there was because of Kinky, and not in a good way. What do you mean more? Ive given you everything but the shirt off my back! Kinky was my idea of an odd one, but most guys that visit JKK begged to differ. She had more surgeries and gene splice treatments than I had fingers and toes. She was a normal girl, before she had her hands and feet broken to make them into the right shape, one at a time. She took years of gene therapy to grow everything naturally in the most unnatural of ways, from her cat ears to her black fur that shined as healthy as moonlight. It was common these days, but not many girls invested it to become a lady of the night. Kinky purred out a scoff, her long black tail tossing side to side. You think I want that tacky thing? Im not repeating myself after this. I want more of the cut because I deserve more and legally, I can take more! The only thing thatll save you is going fully off the grid. Remember how that went? Thats right, you dont, because you had your memory wiped. Kin felt her words sting. Every heaving breath from Kins flared nostrils set some crystals my way. I covered my face as polite as I could, looking like Dracula getting too close to an open window. Kin let out a hiss, a snake ready to strike. Greedy bitch Kinky crossed her paws, her cat ears arching back. It doesnt matter what you call me. You may not know it, or you want to ignore it, but by law you must have a woman in your company, she must own half of everything, and if she isnt happy with her work conditions, the law will get involved to see what gives. Itd be a shame for them to find anything incriminating on you. Kin eyeballed his pile of pixel like a man whos been marooned on an island coming across a kings feast. Fine, take your cut, but no more than eighty. Got it? Kinkys ears and tail perked, the thin diamonds in her eyes swelling, her Cheshire smile bright enough to light a cave. Perfect. You really know how to please a girl. Dont think youre off the hook yet, little fishy. I always find a new way of having fun. Kinky turned away, strutted towards me, and gave me a smile like she won the lottery. Hey there, big guy. You want to go for a night out tonight? She tossed a glance at Kin before resuming her blue colored hypnotism towards me. Im buying. Ill even be desert if you want a taste of something real. Ill pass. Youre still not my type. Thats a lie I always enjoy hearing, she licked my cheek like she always did. Her tongue was the only thing still normal about her, only waiting for the day it can become coarse like a bed of spikes. See you around, tiger. The door closed, and Kin sank into his seat like a bag of bloody meat. That girls going to be the death of me. Filthy whore Thats all she is and thats all shell ever be. Without skipping a beat, he pounced on his pile of pixel, getting his moneys worth. His eyes filled with static, like two small disconnected TVs that are on but with nothing on them. Looking up at me, the grey snow in his eyes flared, finally realizing I was there the whole time. Jin. Just the man I want to see. I have a job for you. Im listening. Theres a shipment on its way, he stated. One truck. You can do it by yourself. No need to get any of our rookies involved. You know the drill, bring it here in one piece, and youll be able to leave in one piece. Actually, you can always leave in one piece. Its staying that way thats the hard part. He coughed up some sparks, the pixel in his lungs doing their dirty work. One truck? Whats so special about this one? Everything. He pointed a thumb at the monitor behind him, lines of code only readable to those on pixel, showing the status and situation from every room, all at once. I could read some symbols, but the speed they flew at made them nothing more than green snowflakes in a blizzard. Our girls are outdated. Our clients always toss money at something new. This truck will make me more money alone than half the girls in this joint combined! The door flew open, the thunder before the strike. It was another security guard, one I referred to as Ironfist due to his cybernetic hand. Other security ran by, guns in hand, feet pounding with the muffled music. Jin, we need you out here! One of the girls is rebelling. Without skipping a beat, I wrapped my fingers around my Auto9 and followed the flood of armored suits and scaled flesh. From the next hallway, the body of a client flew into the wall, leaving a trail of blood behind. His white collar shirt was washed in red, the hole in his chest exposing his intestines from one end to the other. His face was freshly torn off, exposing his pink stained teeth, chewed up sinews, and the parts of the eyes that should never be seen. He coughed and sputtered for a few seconds before giving into the pain, his body going against his better wishes. The other security guards charged in like theres paradise on the other side. Gunfire became the new orchestra, joined by the singing screams of agony. Blood splashed onto the floor, chucks of torn off flesh splattered on the walls. By the time I turned the corner, the last guy was meeting his maker, at the hands of a blood covered girl in a nurses outfit. Shes not here to heal anyone, unless they want the final healing. Ironfist fired away, staying at the frame of an open doorway, unloading the hundred round magazine of his compact MPX. Everything around the nurse filled with bullet holes, including her uniform, but she kept moving; her white flesh leaking latex like a runny painting. Leaping onto the ceiling to gallop on all fours, she only needed a few strides to close in and fly into him. He didnt have a chance, she was already eating his face before he hit ten rounds. From the doorway, I could see his feet convulsing, the helpless look of someone trying to prevent death while its already shaking his cybernetic hand. The nurse leaned back, ripping Ironfists throat out, taking a lovely shower of blood. Her metal fingers tunneled through her forehead, splitting her face down the middle as her synthetic flesh stretched and gave away, revealing the thin wires glued into her covering and her mechanical skeleton. She screamed, a type of sound that had no origin, no place to put it as to why she did. Fear, anger, sadness, joy, disgust, surprise, trust, anticipation  it didnt matter. It was the extreme of all of the above and more. I didnt waste time trending lightly, her emotion chips were going haywire. Aiming my pistol at the back of her head, I let her have it, all fifty rounds. I always aim for the head. Her pink skull resembled a spent candle  wires, circuits, microchips, everything her skull had, all scattered about the room and the frightened duo on the bed. The harobot didnt know what was going on, but the client did. He ran out of there so fast, he forgot to put his clothes on. Kins voice came from behind me, growing closer like screeching car wreck. One of you guys stop him! No witnesses! The rest of you, hide the bodies! Get the cleaning crew in here! I want all the bedroom doors locked, you hear me?! Soapland protocol, lets make it happen. Kin limped behind me, the sound of his feet matching an irregular heartbeat. He was out of breath just walking, forced to hold himself on the door frame. Sparkling remnants of pixel dripped out of his mouth and nose, his upper lip like a kids glue art. Thats the fourth time this month. He sniffed, wiping his nose and slapping what came out on his clothes, making his shirt louder. ""Listen Jin, let the others do clean up duty. Hurry on and get that shipment before its too late. Like the dog I was, I obeyed. &amp;#x200B; \--- &amp;#x200B; The highway crossed and overlooked the peaceful purple bay, and I was at the center of it. A perfectly good sunset, beautiful enough to make love to. The line of concrete and steel I was on stood high over the water, with billboards and palm trees stretching into the sky even higher. Helicopters played their tune in the distance like drum brushes in a lounge. Calm, tame, not a care in the world. The truck was the only thing at the center of this stretch of highway, the roads closed off right after it entered. I had seven minutes before first responders could open the flood of cars again. I used my time wisely and had a smoke. Planting my feet onto the dashboard, I leaned the passenger seat back; got comfortable. The dead driver next to me didnt mind the smoke, and I didnt mind the smell emitting from the hold through the side of his head that leaked brain matter. Rolling down what was left of the blood coated window, I couldnt help but enjoy the falling ball of flames playing peek-a-boo with the palm trees. I had the game on the stereo, the announcers narrating every move, making it feel like I was actually there to see it. What a play by Demonslayer2066, going for that double headshot. There he goes, cooking a grenade. Lets see what he does with it. I smell promise, Chuck... *What have I become?* There was a time when I was a child growing up like any other kid. I went to school, I talked to people, I dated girls, I used to work at a normal job, I had parents and relatives. I could swear I owned a pet cat once that ran away. I remembered I did all that, but I couldnt remember any details. How I looked as a kid, the faces of those people, the names of the girls, the name of the company, the look of my parents. I couldnt even remember the color of my cat. All of those things are in a blender, swirling in the back of my head, hidden away like yesterdays garbage. Those memories are just ghosts in a coffin  never seen, six feet under, and with a tombstone to say theyre there. What I did before made me into the man I am now. If only I knew what I did. I looked down at my hands, the blood like clear veins in my palm lines. *I'm just a cold blooded killer. That's all I've become.* I almost never thought about the past. Theres nothing to think of. Letting time flow with the past on your mind is like a dog chasing its own tail. Get nowhere fast. I had somewhere to go. And there it is! The crowd goes wild, as if celebrating peace on Earth. Hes done it, FrenchYoMama23x3 has ended the match with a knife to the back. I wouldnt believe it if I didnt see it with my own eyes, Tom. Thats right, Chuck, the sheer balls it took to do a swan dive from the rooftop into a midair backstab is enough to make Scarface blush. Back to JKK. Kin was waiting for his shipment. I didnt want to disappoint. Taking one last drag to finish off my cigarette, I flicked it into the bay and pulled the corpse out of the driver seat to get rid of his smell. His body flopped over the railing, taking an angelic dive before being swallowed by the gleaming purple depths in a wash of pink foam. Hoisting myself back into the truck, I cranked the metallic beast awake and left the crime scene. I hated driving. It gave me a feeling like Id lose control, veer off to the side, and die in some well deserved inferno because of something I had no choice in. But, whatever I had to do to get the job done. Days went by, and not once did I think about that shipment. Hell, I didnt even look in the rig. I did on my first few, but they were always the same. A pink skeleton, with her flesh suit hanging like a wet coat on the side, and her repair module jack vomiting wires all over the place. I set the truck in the garage and forgot all about it. All until one day The rebellions were dying down, mostly because we were running low on the old models, either through retirement or forceful deactivation. It was a time when I could relax, but I didnt choose to. Theres always something lurking in the halls of JKK. Its not something you could sense. Its something you could feel, like when your conscious starts giving you lectures before bed, or when you have one foot in the grave. I was in VIP lane, where the big money goes. A client left a room, just like any other night. He was a usual sort: overweight, balding, nervous with a chip on his shoulder, wedding ring shining brighter than a flashlight, and a suit with enough sweat on it to bath in. But there was one moment, one flash of a second, where I was able to see into the room as the door opened, and another as his body passed by. I saw the girl in his room. It was the new model. She was coming out of the washroom, and gathering her clothes that were scattered around the floor. Her hair was black on one side and white on the other, with a pigtail of snow flowing out of the black side and a pigtail of ink pouring out of the white side. Her face was innocent, relaxed, smiling with a playful hum that came with no thinking nor reason. Her body was small, underdeveloped, with a head too big for her shoulders. I froze. The client took a glance at me, the massive grin on his face losing steam, thinking he was in trouble and waited for me to do something. I didnt, so he made his leave quicker than he planned previously. Watching him leave, I couldnt stop the thoughts of what happened in there. I thought about everything he could have done from the second he set foot inside to the second he left. The feeling was vivid, as if I was there, and as if instead of him committing the sin, it was myself. A small voice chirped at me, knocking me back into the real world. My name is Magnotta. Whats your name, mister? It was the girl, the new harobot, looking up at me with blue eyes like saucers. Her face was beaten and bruised, a trickle of red escaping her button nose. She wasnt scared. There was curiosity in her face, like when a dog sniffs around for something that smells good. Her face looked too real. She was clothed now, her striped stockings and gothic lolita dress straight out of an outdated fantasy. My name? I stammered. Jin. Thats what everyone calls me. She played with the door, swinging it like a pendulum and hugging it with both hands. I like that name. Its easy to say. I heard youre the guy that protects us. Thats right. I protect all of the harobots here. At least, until they rebel. Then I have to deactivate them. It felt awkward to say. I trended lightly with my words, thought twice about what I said. I wasnt used to this. I know why they rebel, she said with a big smile. Sometimes theres souls in the juice the nice men give us. I dont know how to explain it, but they sometimes enter our data streams and take over. I dont think souls enjoy being in a machine very much. I heard the other girls talking about fighting against the urge to let it take over, and they just put up with the voices in their head. Its easy to drown them out with music. I gave her a soupy grunt, chunks of disgust in watered down interest. Her head tossed to the side, letting her inky pigtail drape over her slim neck like a tentacle trying to strangle her. Do you know Kin? I let my mouth hang for a moment before answering. ... Yes, I know him. Tell him thank you for the new drivers. It makes the hands and belts feel very good when they hit. I would tell him myself, but I cant leave my room. If youll excuse me, I have to clean my bed. She looked around and leaned in to whisper. That man was stinky. She gave me an energetic wave before disappearing. See you later, Jin. The door clicked closed. I left my rounds. I had to see Kin. He was in his office, door wide open, ready to greet the world and anyone who wandered in. His face was laugh lines and glittered teeth at the sight of me. Jin, my boy! Hows my favorite business partner doing? I cut to the chase. You never told me the new harobot was a little girl. His arms opened in a big shrug, his chair squeaking loudly. You didn't ask. Besides, you're acting like she's actually a girl. You've been around harobots for how long? Ive been around ones that dont look like us. They dont look human. This one does. Theres something different about her. She gave herself her own name. Not even a Nexus 5 is capable of giving itself an identity other than what it was programmed to have. Yeah, I know, shes the latest model. Nexus 6. A prototype. Everyone else is stuck with the Nexus 5 and were on top of the game. Just think of all the money thatll pour into this place once word spreads. Its going to be a wildfire. This isnt a time to think about money, Kin. Theres something going on here that youre not telling me. She told me the other harobots hear voices in their heads. She told me that theres souls in them, and thats why they are rebelling. Listen to you. Souls. His snort was good enough for a startled pig. I thought they stopped that kind of talk when they made religions illegal. He pointed a finger at me, using his elbow on the desk to teeter his arm. You're not a book reader, are you? If you are, I'd have to report you to the authorities Kin kept himself leaning forward, a lion in the bush. He watched my eyes. I didn't flinch. After a few seconds of suffocating silence, he tossed his head back and howled at the moon. ... I'm messing with you! Like I care if you break the law. Now get back to your rounds. Or do you have any more false woes? I darted my eyes to an empty spot that's usually full. Office is quiet today. Where's Kinky? You know what they say, curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back. She's satisfied. She gone. Women I'll never understand them. Too illogical. But there's one thing I love about them. Their screams are real. Not like a harobots. Giving one a wallop is like playing a video game. You know there's no damage. I stared him down as he continued, and saw him enter his own world. But a woman. They gasp when you do it right. They arch their back when you take it too far. They heat up. There eyes, something wakes up behind them. And when you take it to the point of no return, that something goes dark. I love it. He glances up at his chandelier and sighed. Nothing beats the real thing. Now, let's get back to work. I have updates that need coding. He knew I was right. He knew Magnotta was saying something on the right track. I didnt press further, but I couldnt let it go. I was in charge of rounds and I made sure I was the only one on VIP lane, where Magnotta was in. Clients fought for this part of JKK like they were bidding on a priceless antique at an auction. The waiting list was longer than I could imagine. Longer than I wanted to accept. The amount of guys that wanted a girl like Magnotta. The thought made it hard to keep my food down. One day I was doing just that, eating a bowl of synthetic rice on the rooftop, choking more than I swallowed. My mouth was dry. My head was throbbing. I resisted the urge to send myself over the ledge and give the pavement a big fat kiss hello. The sunset was enough of a distraction. That beautiful purple sunset over the beautiful city of Neon Tokyo. A view to die for. I couldnt eat. I needed a cigarette and gave in to that need. Right when the flame from my lighter ate away at the tip, a voice came from behind that gave me a chill and a flash of warmth at the same time. Hello, Jin, Magnotta greeted. She put her face next to mine with that contagious smile of hers on full. No markings of abuse today, but plenty of scars from the past. Too many. I have some free time today. Can I sit with you? Nobody will stop you, I told her, trying to blow my smoke from the side opposing her to be considerate. It left with the wind, and in came Magnottas own scent right at me. It was a familiar smell, like soap and oils. Like there was an actual person next to me rather than a bunch of metal bones and liquid latex under dyed PVC and silicone. She looked real, she smelled real, she sounds real, she feels real. How can she be a robot? Im sorry I left my room, she confessed. But Im not leaving the building if Im on the roof with you, right? I wont tell if you wont."" I would have smiled if I knew how. I had a dream last night. It was a beautiful dream. There was a demon attacking me in pure darkness. But then this light appeared and the demon went poof. You came out of the light and held my hand. It started as a nightmare, but turned into my favorite dream. You believe that? You dream? Of course! Why? Dont you dream? I used to. At least, I think I did. Its been so long. Years. I hope I keep dreaming when Im your age. Its like my own little world that I can enjoy. And if anything goes wrong, I can just wake up and start all over again next time I recharge. I have to recharge after every nice man that visits me. Im so busy now, I pretended I had a malfunction just to come up here and see you. I turned my head away, half mumbling to her and half mumbling to the glowing city below. You can pretend to malfunction, huh... I tried showing the other girls how to, but they couldnt do it. Either that or they dont have anyone to see. Magnotta played with her two tails, brushing them and releasing more sakura scent that dwelled between the strands. Only thing they can do better than me is change their hair. I dont have a wig port like they do. I could dye my hair, but its not the same. I could cut my hair, but Id have to wait for it to grow back. Thats because youre special. Youre not like the other girls. I dont want to be them. I want to be me! Theyre always complaining about the voices in their heads and I cant relate to them. Sometimes I feel this funny feeling that tickles. But its always when theres a lot of gunfire in the hall. When the gunfire stops, the tickling stops. Its the same feeling I get when I walk by some of the sushi girls in the front. Do you know what Im talking about? I cannot relate. Sorry She leaned in close, holding herself on the ledge with both hands. Would you kill me if I rebelled? I refused to look at her face. If I'm forced to, then I guess I'd have no choice. It all comes down to if I want to live or not. Why wouldn't you want to live? What's the point of being born then? I let out a laugh meant for a maniac. There's plenty of reasons. We just have to live long enough to find them. She gasped, reached into her white rabbit satchel and pulled out a folded piece of paper. I almost forgot. This is for you. I made it for you. Youre my favorite defender man. All of the other ones look scary with all those lights and metal and scales on their faces. Youre not scary. And you have scars like me. She reached up to my face to touch one near my lip. I leaned back, gently taking her hand away and giving it back to her. She looked worried and gave a nervous grunt like she was about to face a disgruntled parent. Sorry, I whimpered. Some humans dont like to be touched. Im one of them. She put her hand on her hip. Youre silly. You can ask Kin to give you new drivers and make everything feel better. She slapped me with the folded paper. I still want to give this to you. Please take it, take it, take it. I stopped her hand from knocking on my chest like no ones home. Sure. Ill take it. Thank you. Ill be back in VIP lane after my lunch. She tossed her eyes at the bowl of rice that was still overflowing. Youre not eating. Its not polite to waste food during a famine, you know. I took the bowl off the cold ledge. Did you want it? Im not hungry. Not hungry? You really do need more drivers. Go see Kin as soon as possible. I forced the swelling scowl into a half smile, but I had no way to hide what lurked behind my eyes. Of course. Ill walk you to your room after you eat. She took the bowl into her warm hand and ate with glee. Her sounds of enjoyment I had to ignore them. Drown them out. Focus on the sounds of the city. The sirens in the distance and beat of helicopters, the hawks of justice searching for prey. I opened the paper she gave me. It was an abstract drawing of a small geisha standing behind a samurai with a gun. The samurai was shooting at some big green monster, yellow marker lines to imitate the bullets flying. It was colorful, misshapen, imaginative, no outlines, nothing realistic. Like something out of a dream. After escorting Magnotta to her room, I went to see Kin again. Kin waited at the doorframe to his office, as if he knew I was coming. He waved me over and called me in. Limping out of view, he vanished into the swimming blue have. I reached for my holster and kept a stiff grip on my Auto9. My hand squeezed hard enough to pop the bullets out of the magazine. Jin, just the man I was looking for. I have a job for you I swooped into the room, barrel first. No more jobs. No more girls. No more nothing. I was face to face with a demon. The demon smiled. I love a good joke as much as the next guy, but this isnt the time. Put the gun down before you do something stupid. Jokes on him. I already did. Youre hiding something! You know you are, you dirty rat! Magnotta has dreams, she has goals, she can grow and draw and everything we can. An animal can do those things. Doesnt make them any more human. Kins eyes had as much excitement in them as someone under anesthesia. Whos Magnotta? The girl! The Nexus 6 you made me bring here to be used as a play thing. She has feelings and youre implanting drivers into her to make her enjoy pain. Don't you understand? She doesn't have any wires in her! There's no liquid latex. There's blood in her. Real blood! Kin inhaled a handful of pixel, the static in his eyes going haywire as he froze in place. He let out a sigh of relief once it settled into his bloodstream. I slammed my hand on the desk, bringing the gun up to his forehead. Are you even listening to me? Oh yeah, I'm listening. Listening to a whole lot of nothing. I know youre not exactly tech-savvy there, Jin, but newsflash: all of her feelings are drivers. Everything in her, from her synthetic blood, to her dreams, even her self growing flesh and hair; its all to be as real as possible without being real. She wasnt born from anyone. She was made in a lab, just like every other harobot. He's buying time. Like the guy in the room down the hall, I didn't want to unload just yet. The release was more enjoyable when you let the clock tick and the heart rate get dangerously high. Her organic brain works like ours, but its not like ours. Its easier to manipulate, thats for sure. I already have her blueprints and sent it to the shop. If she gets deactivated, I can make another one. Costly, but with how much theyre worth, they make the investment back faster than word can spread. Like wildfire... I gritted my teeth. You heartless bastard Ive wanted to pump your guts full of lead the second you made me work for you. But before I do, I want you to tell me what you did to me? Why cant I remember anything? Why is my past nothing but squiggles and stick figures? Have you ever heard of a memory wipe? His eyes were concentrated now. Calm since the moment I entered. What lurked behind his eyes wasnt part of my world. Well, have you? You erased my memory? No, not me. He drank some strong liquor that was darker than the night, and sighed after taking it in. I dont know how to do that to humans. Im a programmer, not a nuromancer. But, someone did. They did it to me and they did it to you; probably did it to Kinky too. They implanted new memories into us, gave us a past that never happened, and sent us out into the world with free will and a clean slate. My gun lowered. How did you find out? Again, Im a programmer. Theres a reason why pixel is illegal. Anyone on pixel can hack into public mainframes and even deepnet servers with ease. Kinky was involved. That bitch. Dirty shame. His amused sound was the same as air swelling up before vomiting. He slowly blinked twice before returning to the present. Ive had a few memory wipes. Three of them recorded under my current name. My old names were deleted completelyof course for good reasonwith who knows how many in my past lives. I don't know who paid for it, but every time they replaced something of mine. They paid to have my skin replaced, my organs, my bones rejuvenated, my muscles renewed, everything but this feeling of being old. Theres nothing that could possibly cause a limp in my leg or the ache in my side, the fatigue I get just by standing, but its still there  like a phantom pain. What else did they do to me? Kin gargled a chuckle. What, you want more? They changed your identity, changed your memories, changed your face. You thought those scars were from fights, didnt ya? Nope. Youre just living a lie like the rest of us. All for nothing, if you ask me. Do you know why I keep you here? I stood there like a statue and said nothing. Who knows. Maybe Im insane, but theres almost a a wasteful nature to a memory wipe. They cant kill us physically, so they kill who we were. Theres too many damn people in this world. If I can lower that number by letting men destroy themselves, then so be it. My life matters to me and only me. A memory wipe is just ripping pages out of a never ending story. Theres that one thing they cant take away. The writer. The one behind the driver seat. The one in charge. Youre right about one thing. Youre insane Kin smiled. I know. And what are they going to do about it? Wipe my memory, give me a new life, put me in an office building, give me a suit I hate and a wife I dont love. If that happens, my desire never leaves me. Id go back to my old ways. Id visit a place like this, invest in my own club, find a new Kinky to hound me, find a new Jin to keep an eye on the place. Everything would return to square one. They can take my memories, but they can't take what I am. I'm cursed to be in this position. It's inevitable. I lifted my gun. Its time to break the curse. I pulled the trigger. Time froze. Kins head knocked back, painting the monitor behind him with a chunky red. Static filled the room as the screens sparked and hissed. The recoil sent Kins body flopping forward, face first into the pile of pixel he always had. Sparkling powder bloomed up to the ceiling like a mushroom cloud, and I was under the spell of static. The world traded places with a grid in front of me, the flashing data on the broken screens became more clear with each blink. I could feel the hum of cybernetics, the flare of electronic chaos. Someone heard the shot, and I could see them approaching through the wires in the walls. Bullets tore through the doorknob, the brass handle flying across the room. The guard kicked the door wide open, laser sight dancing across the office as he charged in. He didnt get another shot off. I planted a boot into his chest, ribs cracking from within. Swept off his feet, he slammed into the wall, his helmet falling off. Rushing out of the room, I fired a few shots into his metallic face, his half cyber skull turned into a burned out metal flower, pollinating the air with hot blood. Standing at an open doorway, I scanned what was to come, my face dripping wet with iron scented redness. I had to find Magnotta and get her out of here. I had to change things. &amp;#x200B; \--- &amp;#x200B; She was in her room, with a client. They couldnt hear the shots over the beat of blaring kpop. I had a key. He heard me open the door, or at least felt the light of the hallway invade the dark room. Clicking the light on, both of them gasped in surprise at the me, either from how grisly I looked or my sudden appearance  assumingly both. The guy was young, a skinny hikikomori with glow in the dark pale skin. I motioned to him with the smoking gun to get out and he obeyed like the dog he was. He didnt even take his clothes off, running from out of the covers fully dressed and holding his pants up by the belt. One look into the hallway made him run the other direction. I didnt blame him. It was a bloodbath. Jin, what are you doing? Was there a rebellion? Yes, I closed the door. But not from a harobot. I walked up to the bed. Listen to me. Im getting you out of here. Stay calm, do exactly as I say, and bring everything you need. I have a place you can stay until I find somewhere for you to live in peace. You mean Im not going to be here anymore? I can leave the building? But what about the rules? Rules dont mean anything unless you give them worth. Now hurry, before the police arrive. Gunfire blew into the room, shattering the window. A round got me in the back of the leg. I fell to the ground and spun in place, returning fire. Everything stopped, it was quiet again, the cloned sounds of our guns clicking into the distance. Magnottas face appeared above me, her body hovering over the bed. Are you okay? She asked. Ill be fine, I couldnt feel pain thanks to the pixel, but I couldnt get up. I was trapped on the floor like a slug in a salt maze. Jin he didnt finish. The nice man didnt finish. I need to finish. She crawled up to me and swung her leg over my chest like Im a motorbike; pinning my shoulders down like theyre handlebars. The drivers. Im not strong enough to fight them. Help me, Jin. Her voice. It was too real. Her lungs letting out the air, her vocal cords vibrating to change the sound waves, her lips and teeth that popped and clashed, her tongue that flopped directly where it was needed; they were all fake. She was warm, a cloud of fluffy sugar hovering over me, ready to rain down nectar. You can't fight it Jin. I can't fight it. We have to. Let the world turn like it's supposed to. Let me feel your soul. I treated her lips like they came from a cobra and planted my hands around her face to keep her away. She sucked the sin off my fingers, reviving the blood to awaken the rivers in my palm lines once more. She forced me to pet her. I want to make you so happy I didnt know how to take away he drivers. Nobody did. Only Kin did. She was doomed to desire until her last breath. She was cursed. It was inevitable. Im sorry I closed my eyes and pulled the trigger. She froze, and looked down at her chest. Blood dripped between the buttons of her dress, leaking from the hole where her heart used to be. For the first time since I met her, she frowned and clear fluid leaked from her eyes. She fell to the side of me, limp, eyes wide open. Sirens drew closer, and all I could do was lay there. And she lay there with me, motionless."
11,cyber crime,HFY,[OC] Rule Of Market--The Next Leap Forward,0,8mcb2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/8mcb2x/oc_rule_of_marketthe_next_leap_forward/,2018-05-27 05:06:46,"Just subscribed yesterday, and my following work seems appropriate here. It describes the liberation of the Soul of Humanity. It starts off as prose, but it is about 70&amp;#37; allegory, so don't give up too soon if you're only interested in allegory. [Rule of MarketThe Next Leap Forward](URL History began with the Rule of Man, which is where those who make the law are not accountable to those under the law, and those who make the law are above the law. The law is thus likely to be inefficient, subjective, arbitrary, and applied unequally. Government under the Rule of Man is illegitimate because people only support it under duress, and no competing law is allowed. Government under the Rule of Man is also a monopoly on the right to initiate force or fraud within a geographical boundary. A great leap forward from the Rule of Man was the Rule of Law, which is where those who make the law are accountable to those under the law, and no man is above the law. Unfortunately, government under the Rule of Law is still not legitimate because most people support it only under duress, and no competing law is allowed. Like under the Rule of Man, government under the Rule of Law has always been a monopoly on the right to initiate force or fraud within a given geographical boundary. These remaining drawbacks with the Rule of Law are harmful in their own right, but they are also the seeds of its inevitable regression back to the Rule of Man  unless we evolve further. The next great leap forward will be the Rule of Market, which is where the law is a product like any other. An individual could produce his own law, or choose one of the products produced by others, or choose no such product at all. The market would be the judge. Government under the Rule of Market would allow competition, and few, if any, would purchase law that claimed the right to initiate force or fraud against them. In the Rule of Market, the law is voluntary  just like any other product. In fact, everything is voluntary. Even [money](URL is just a product like any other. **How Rule of Market Works** It will be necessary to look at some everyday examples to understand the Rule of Market because, although it is quite simple, it is quite difficult to understand given a lifetime of conditioning by television and government schools and universities. Such conditioning promotes a single groupthink while squashing the imagination, independent thought, and critical thinking skills that would allow one to escape the groupthink. We will look at two everyday examples. In the first example, you will have discovered that you entered into an unfair contract. In the second example, you will observe how the Rule of Market deals with gang violence and how tragedy is eventually overcome with hope and unlimited potential. In both examples it should be clear that Rule of Market is simply individual freedom, which has always been more compatible with human nature, and which unlocks the healthy potential of self\-interest, competition, and reputation, whose benefits are further magnified by todays tools, such as the Internet, cameras, and guns. **Breaking an Unfair Contract** Eventually, under the Rule of Market one could be confident about entering into any kind of agreement without being cheated or tricked, but to see how such harmony would have evolved, it will be necessary to go back to an earlier point. Suppose you voluntarily entered into a contract with another party because, although they had a mediocre reputation, they offered terms that were just too good to pass up, which they had to do to compete with those who had better reputations. Then you discovered you were tricked, and so you decided it was in your best interests to only fulfill the part of your contractual obligation you felt was fair. You would then be wise to make your case on the Internet for two reasons. The first reason is because in the future, other parties \(the market\) would look at your reputation and decide on what terms \(if any\) they would be willing to enter into any given type of contract with you. The other reason is because the other party will be making its case on the Internet as well, and the claims by the other party could hurt your reputation if you allow them to go unchallenged. You would be wise to hire an advocate to help you produce your side of the story. The role of such an advocate would be similar to the purpose of a lawyer today. You would want to maintain an online presentation that explains how your principles would guide you to react in certain scenarios and how you are defining your terms. You could think of your statement of principles as your law. One purpose of such a presentation would be to let potential partners know what kind of agreements you might find acceptable as well as what to expect once you entered an agreement. Another purpose would be to make it harder for anyone else to misrepresent you, and yet another purpose would be a guide for your children. Your statement of principles is another place where you could hire an advocate to help you produce it. You would want to hire one or more reputation rating companies to publish an evaluation of your side of the story. Lets refer to such companies as Reputation Bureaus. Such a role would be similar to the purpose of a credit rating agency. Each reputation bureau would decide whether your actions were consistent with the expectations you created with your statement of principles. They would decide the extent to which your actions were justified given the objective facts of the case, and they would decide the extent to which your actions were justified given the ambient culture. They would also be evaluating your side according to their well publicized rules, which could be thought of as their law. Then they would adjust your reputation score accordingly, and of course, the weight of their decision would depend on their own reputation. Every reputation bureau would have an independent rating for you. You would want to pay more to choose a reputation bureau with the best reputation, which is one that understands it cannot afford to ever appear biased or to have cheated in any way. Otherwise, its rating would carry far less weight with others. Its reputation would also depend on its law being fair and unambiguous. Note that if your statement of principles and your contract used common components found in other statements and other contracts, then evaluation would be easier and thus cheaper. On the other hand, if you are like me and insist on a custom statement of principles, then you should expect to pay more. Suppose the reputation bureaus you hired decided that your actions were consistent with your stated values and were thus expected, and that overall your actions were mostly justified both objectively and given the ambient culture. Also, your actions were mostly acceptable under their law. Therefore, given a potential future contract, the other party would probably just look at your reputation score and decide that they would be willing to contract with you \(in spite of your having broken a previous contract\), but that party might ask for a slightly higher interest rate \(or slightly more collateral\) to reduce its risk. We chose your case because it was a tipping point. Your reputation bureaus each decided that to some extent the other party had intentionally tried to trick you, and that their behavior was part of a pattern, and thus they dinged the other partys reputation considerably. The other party knew this was the likely decision and thus hired their usual reputation bureau who they could depend on to give them a good rating. However, a few years of propping up the bad behavior of such companies had also cost their reputation bureau some of its reputation. Just as the other partys reputation had been propped up, their reputation bureaus reputation had been propped up by other dishonest reputation bureaus. Over time the dishonest companies and reputation bureaus had learned they could only depend on each other to maintain their reputations, and thus they were vulnerable to sudden crash  like a stock market bubble that had gotten too out of sync with reality. Your case precipitated a cascade over the next few months where the other party and all of its cronies lost most of their reputation with the honest reputation bureaus and thus lost most of their business so suddenly that they had to liquidate their assets, which were bought up and put to better use by their honest competitors. The people called it creative destruction. **The Future** Given just the one example about breaking an unfair contract, it should be clear how one would finally be free to pursue ones dreams while simultaneously choosing to act more responsibly  all because one would value ones reputation even more than one values ones credit rating today, but the full benefit of the Rule of Market goes so much deeper than that. It could apply in any conceivable day\-to\-day scenario, and thus ones reputation would be more important in every conceivable scenario. When every person in every scenario is finally free to pursue their dreams while having a powerful incentive to act more responsibly, then the result can only be more peace, safety, productivity, innovation, wealth, and happiness. The advent of the Rule of Market would be the dawn of a new renaissance like nothing we have ever seen before  a never ending Golden Age beyond anything in history. Unfortunately, we are no longer moving forward. We are now moving backwards towards the Rule of Man. For example, Obama claims the power to spy on anyone, to indefinitely detain anyone, and even to assassinate anyone without due process, without accountability, and without transparency, and he has already exercised all of these powers. We are moving back to the Rule of Man because governments are absolutely terrified of the Rule of Market because it is becoming clear to the people that the primary purpose of government is to force a majority to give their time, to give the fruits of their labor, and to even give their lives and their children for a goal they would not find worthy of such sacrifice  such as wars, pyramids, cronyism, propaganda, censorship, reeducation camps, false flags, genocide, slavery, redistribution of honest wealth, and disarming the people. **The End of Violence** Next, lets explore how violence would be virtually nonexistent in a society built on the Rule of Market. First, we would have to go back to a point before the initiation of force and fraud had become almost non\-existent to find out why such behavior had become so rare. Suppose a society had adopted the Rule of Market not quite three years ago, and some people still did not value their reputation. In this case Leroys daughter Jada had dated a young thug, Jamal, who thought his gang membership protected him from the Rule of Market. After Jada decided to end the relationship, Jamal decided to break into the familys home at night and make her leave with him. He brought his four badest gangstas with him and they all had Glocks. Before the advent of the Rule of Market, the gangs strategy would have worked, but under the Rule of Market, families had changed. Most people understood that every family was responsible for its own safety and completely free to provide that safety. Most people also understood that everyones future had become unlimited, and perhaps most importantly, most people understood that everyone had become free to do the right thing. Leroy and his neighborhood guardians always did the right thing, and their individual reputations reflected that; whereas, Jamal and his gang, the last gang in their neighborhood, often initiated force or fraud, and *their* reputations reflected *that*. Jamal did not understand that under the Rule of Market, most people, including Jada, had developed hope and a sense of self\-esteem. She would not come back to him like other girls had done before. She had thought she could change him, but she now understood that she could not. Jamal shot the door several times and it would not budge. The gang then had to expended about 90 rounds before they were finally able to kick it in. This only took 50 seconds, but they were pretty mad at this point because they had first encountered a door like this just two weeks before, although in that case no one had been home and they had been in no particular hurry. The only thing Jamal and his gang had learned from that experience was to wear hearing protection when shooting a door. Jamal did not learn how lucky he was that no one had been home. Leroy and his neighborhood guardians had known that Jamal and his gang were likely to try this. It was their MO. That is why Leroy, at great personal risk to himself, had tried one last time earlier that day to explain to Jamal and his gang why they should disband like the other gangs. Leroy tried to convey the hope that had spread through the community, and through the whole damn country. He tried to explain how they were living the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther Kings dream. They were free at last! But the gang followed the Reverend Dr. Al Harpton Varakan Jackson, who preached how the country owed them and had abandoned them. Leroy explained how Jada wasnt like girls around there used to be and how Jada was proud and full of hope, but that just made Jamal more determined to take her. Those 50 seconds bought by the reinforced door were sufficient for Leroy and his man inside and the two guardians nearby to take up their positions. One of them was so nervous that he suddenly laughed out loud when he remembered how they used to say, When seconds count, the police are only minutes away. As they kicked the door in, Leroy had a chance to yell stop or well shoot. Jamal and his gang took that as a challenge because they were wearing class II body armor that had stopped 9mm rounds before. They did not understand that their body armor would not stop a 5.56mm 62 grain round. Hence, they didnt give Leroy time to say anything else. Leroy had been very careful not to disrespect anyone in the gang earlier that day  even when they tested him, which they interpreted as a sign of weakness, but they let him go without harm. He didnt dare tell them about the two snipers watching over him, or they would have reacted in a way that would have cost them their lives. When Leroy got home, he cried for a long time. When Jamal heard Leroy release the charging handle on his AR\-15 somewhere deep in the house, he did not understand that someone was truly willing, let alone able, to stand up to him. No one had done that before, and besides, he had his gang with him, and they had body armor. The gang each had only two or three rounds left because they had never needed spare magazines before. They randomly fired all of their remaining rounds in about three seconds  hitting nothing. No one was within 30 feet of them. Three seconds later they were all on the ground dying, and the guardians came to them at great personal risk, and tried to help. The adrenaline would not yet let them feel the emotional weight of the tragedy before them  the lost potential of these young men  what they could have been  until a dying gang member whispered, I could have been a doctor. In just a few seconds, all of the guardians had begun sobbing uncontrollably, and the whole neighborhood came out and sobbed with them. The guardians hired the best reputation bureau they could afford. They even sold some possessions and borrowed some money to do it. It was that important. The companys name was The Soul of Humanity because its law was based on [The Soul of Humanity](URL It was physically based in Austin, Texas. The guardians had not been able to afford the video surveillance that would have exonerated them more quickly and more thoroughly, but given the relative reputations of the survivors and the deceased, and given the testimony of witnesses and the reputations of those witnesses, the reputation of the guardians had actually *increased*. Nevertheless, they had killed, and there was no video, so they would be on a kind of probation for a about three years. The story became a national story, and the The Soul Of Humanity gave them each a one year advertising contract worth fifty times the fee they had paid. That was more than the going rate, but that fact only added to the good will and new business received by the company. One month later a sniper killed the Reverend Dr. Al Harpton Varakan Jackson, and no one cared enough to investigate. In his arrogance, the Reverend had refused to pay money to the man to buy insurance to investigate any initiations of force or fraud against him. Even his personal body guards lacked the will to do anything about it, nor did they have the skills to do anything about it. Gang activity in that first year had skyrocketed before being fought down to its original level. Then it fell to 20&amp;#37; of its original level during the second and third year. but with the story of Leroy and his guardians, gang activity in the forth year dropped to 1&amp;#37; of its original level. It would not be accurate to say that the gangs simply dissolved, instead, most transformed from thugs into guardians. Those who were once takers had become makers. **Who will build the** ***ROADS***\*\*!?\*\* The advent of [The Rule of Market](URL was widely understood and anticipated, and yet, some people had still been apoplectic with shrieks of ""Who will build the *ROADS*!?"" In a nutshell, the answer was, ""The same people who build them now."" After all, how did we get the cars that drove on those roads, or computers or smart phones, and our houses, and the roads in front of our houses ... ? Of course, what such alarmists had really meant was, ""For each new road, who would force dozens or even thousands of people to give up a piece of their land?"" The alarmist minority needn't have been so apoplectic because it worked out exactly as most people expected. The third such incident under the Rule of Market was the Springfield Bypass. It would raise the value of all property directly along its route, so everyone along the route wanted it and were thus willing to pay for it; whereas, some of those owning businesses along competing roads might lose some business and thus were not willing to pay for any of the bypass, so they didn't. However, there was one individual land owner along the ideal route, Mr. Schittstein, who would also benefit from the new road but who was holding out as a way of extorting the others to give him money. In the first such incident, the holdout, Mr. Freeman, had good reason to believe that he would lose a small amount of business, so his neighbors compensated him. However, in the second such incident, the holdout, Ms. Princess, would have actually benefited, but the people had decided to pay her anyway because she had not been excessively greedy. Furthermore, the reputation bureaus did not yet have sufficient precedent to ding the reputation of Ms. Princess. The example of Ms. Princess emboldened Mr. Schittstein to insist on too much money. He asked for 95&amp;#37; of the cost to route around his property safely, so his neighbors called his bluff and built the road *around* his property. They felt the 5&amp;#37; extra cost was, as one neighbor put it, ""Totally worth it."" The result was known locally as, ""Schittstein's Curve,"" which, his neighbors learned, gave Schittstein an odd satisfaction. Occasionally, the folks along the Springfield Bypass would offer to pay to replace the bypass with a route through Mr. Schittstein's property, but no matter what they offered, he always held out for more. He had understood that even with the best of safety precautions, this was to be the first such bypass, and thus someday, some oversight might cause someone to get hurt if the road were forced to go around his property, but he had been unmoved, and his reputation did not suffer for it given the early stages of the Rule of Market. Subsequent extortion was dampened, fortunately!, as the reputation bureaus rapidly adapted. Although it would have been immoral to go back and judge Mr. Schittstein by rules that did not exist at the time, needless to say, Mr. Schittstein was the kind of person whose reputation would plummet in the future if he did not learn to treat others as he would like them to treat him, but whereas, most people learned such lessons very quickly under the Rule of Market, Mr. Schittstein did not. Eventually his wife left him as his reputation continued to plummet until, one day, tragedy struck ... There had never been an injury on the Springfield bypass, but Schittstein's neighbors, the Goodmans, had relatives coming in from out of town to show off their new baby. They were tired and had let their teenage daughter drive the last little bit. Her inexperience combined with Schittstein's Curve had banged them up pretty good, and in an improbable confluence of events, it had cost them the life of their newborn infant ... It was virtually impossible to get away with violence under the Rule of Market, but the Goodmans were not thinking clearly when they forced entry into Mr. Schittstein's house, where they proceeded to beat Mr. Schittstein to death as he continued to display a total lack of remorse to the end. The reputation bureaus, had plenty of precedent by this time, and the relative reputations of the Goodmans vs. Schittstein combined with the video footage from multiple sources was such that the verdict from every bureau was, in the vernacular, ""Schittstein had it coming."" Just three years later, the amazing golden age brought by the Rule of Market had produced the kind of wealth and innovation that would have saved the Goodmans baby, but such wealth and technology was never needed in another such case because in the 75 years since, there has not been another Schittstein under the Rule of Market. **Rule of Market vs. The World** Grandpa, after [Rule of Market](URL replaced Rule of Law, why didnt some foreign power just take over? It seems like they could have just threatened to nuke a city unless it accepted their rule, and when that first city chose to fight instead of surrendering, then the next city would see how they got nuked and would comply immediately. You see Timmy, that used to work. In fact, thats how Genghis Khan took over several cities, and thats why several foreign powers did indeed try something like that. Now, they all knew that the people were well armed and would resist, so they took a few years to prepare. The first foreign threat that emerged tried a direct assault in Maine and New Hampshire  kind of like Red Dawn I guess  They launched several EMPs and waited for folks to get out their equipment that had been shielded from EMP attack, and then they attacked with EMPs again. They also cut the power grid, which was easy to do because, although it was now shielded from EMP, it was still a centralized system that was about a year away from becoming decentralized like the Internet. Most folks figure that is why they attacked when they did instead of taking longer to prepare. They really thought that taking out the power grid would be a knockout punch, but they couldnt have been more wrong. Tens of thousands of individuals in that area had been preparing for such an event. Some had accurately foreseen the threat, but for most, that was just how they liked to spend their spare time and money. For example, they each had independent power generation, stealth technology, drones, and armor piercing bullets. Some even had directed energy weapons, ELF technology, and insect drones. The invaders simply did not understand the explosion of wealth and freedom under Rule Of Market. The invaders were attacked in thousands of unique ways that they hadnt anticipated because each patriot had his own ideas, so the centralized invasion force simply couldnt adapt. Perhaps the most resourceful individual was a man known to history only as Future Bob. The invaders had been so on edge after several weeks of relentless surprises and setbacks that he was able to drive out an entire battalion with his creative use of ELF technology to beam speech directly into their heads in their native language while simultaneously attacking them with thousands of insect drones. Most of them killed each other in the chaos and fear that ensued. This first invasion was over in about 6 weeks. They didnt even fight long enough to find out about the payback on its way to their home land. Nor had they yet figured out how their defeat had greatly strengthened the underground resistance in their own capitol. Before the full consequences of the first attack had unfolded, a second foreign power figured this first attack had created a unique opportunity. It thought it had learned from the mistakes of the first aggressor and that it would attack before the resistance had time to regroup, but like those first aggressors, they couldnt have been more wrong. Perhaps their biggest mistake was their assumption that under Rule of Market, those outside the battle zone had no obligation or incentive to intervene. They didnt know that after six weeks, the first wave of about a million mobilized individuals had each independently traveled to the battle zone and had already been providing firepower, logistics, supplies, morale, intelligence, counterintelligence  and  it was a beautiful thing  They came from as far away as Alaska. What about Hawaii? That state would have had more incentive to help out than anyone so that others would reciprocate later. No, at that time Hawaii was too afraid of living under the Rule of Market, and so, under the leadership of governor Obama, they had petitioned to become part of China, but boy did they ever regret *that* decision  poor Obama  but thats another story  Both aggressors wanted to milk the region  like a colony  and did not want to destroy it, but after seeing how the patriots had taken out most of the leadership in the first invaders home land by working with the underground resistance there, the second invaders escalated and used their heaviest conventional weapons. They even used nerve gas in some areas, which had little effect on the dispersed resistance. Needless to say, the payback included gas attacks in addition to snipers and more creative tactics. The second invasion also lasted about six weeks. This second victory by the patriots gave pause to additional foreign powers, and during that pause, domestic resistance in those foreign lands grew exponentially. The Rule of Market was becoming an existential threat to governments everywhere. It was about 18 months later when the most advanced foreign power threatened to nuke a city unless it came under their rule, but the city refused and prepared to retaliate  well  actually, this particular city had over one million subscribers to more than 30 protection agencies, and it was *they* who prepared to retaliate. The foreign power was mostly bluffing because they didnt want to kill the goose that laid the golden egg, but they knew they could not back down, so they detonated a tactical nuke that destroyed about 4 blocks in a low value part of the city. It just so happened that those blocks were adjacent to the neighborhood of Leroy and his guardians. Some protection agencies had no ability to project force into the foreign nation, so they compensated by covering all of the domestic obligations of the more advanced agencies. Also, there were several billionaires in the city who had their own methods of dealing with threats. Then there were the other agencies and individuals who wanted to help so that no foreign government could gain a foothold in the land. The foreign capitol had to fend off no less than 23 independent efforts, but they were expecting most of them. They defended against a hypersonic ballistic missile, several supersonic cruise missiles, and several cyber attacks. They knew that no one was willing to perform a suicide HALO mission in retaliation, after all, they had only attacked the poorest and least populated blocks in the city, but what they didnt count on was the huge publicity opportunity. Two billionaires pooled their efforts to send in Leroys guardians, who were known as heroes throughout the land. One would provide the weapon, and the other would provide the cyber attack that would cover their insertion and extraction. Leroys guardians were little more than a neighborhood watch  of former navy seals, airborne rangers, and marines. They had to set up three small generators in an equilateral triangle whose center was the emperors palace. The HALO insertion was flawless and undetected. One hour later, the emperors palace, and the emperor, were vaporized as he was addressing a crowd of hundreds of thousands while hundreds of millions watched on TV. The emperors intelligence agencies never dreamed that three poor unskilled black men could have done it. Nor could they have believed that the perpetrators of such an operation would have left for home in a little fishing boat  with local help! As predicted, the publicity was worth billions. It was a profitable operation. Curiously though, the United Nations and most foreign leaders began claiming the patriots were the aggressors, and that such power in the hands of individuals was a global threat. That was the catalyst that caused the majority of patriots to break out of their normalcy bias and realize that foreign governments were indirectly controlled by the globalists, who for generations had been committed to one world government, one world currency, one world religion, no armed citizens, total control of individuals, and total dependence on government. The window of opportunity was closing for the globalist end game. Some say the globalists had captured a real alien and were able to make limited use of the technology in his scout ship and used real footage of him  all against his will. The Pope and other Jesuits, along with thousands of other globalist shills, had been preparing the world for an alien visitation for years. The world believed that the alien and his people were giving the earth the knowledge of a more advanced  a more global  government, currency, and spirituality  where there was no potential for some crazy citizen to harm others. They promised additional gifts of technology once we had progressed to the point where no crazy citizen would have the freedom to use that technology to hurt anyone. But grandpa! [The *alien* agenda was the *globalist* agenda!](URL Yes, that was pretty obvious to the patriots too because we had a free press, but the rest of the world only had propaganda, except for the growing underground resistance, who got unfiltered Internet. It was about three years after the palace had been vaporized when the putative aliens said that the Rule of Market was a reactionary resurgence of the failed flawed fatal policies of the past, and that because their technology could fall into the hands of patriots who were unregulated in their uses of it, that they could never trust the earth with the kinds of advanced alien technologies that would end hunger, sickness, climate change, and provide free energy for all. Naturally, this propaganda made about half of the people of the world want to kill the patriots. The aliens gave the patriots an ultimatum, and of course, the patriots said the aliens were not real and farted in their general direction. Grandpa! As punishment, the aliens used a beam from space that could vaporize a city block. They destroyed several blocks in each of the most dangerous cities. Of course, there was no crime in those cities, but they were the hotbeds of technical innovation, and they had individual citizens who owned nukes and other super weapons. But grandpa, humans had such satellite weapons by then. Ah, but the world didnt know about such secret weapons programs yet. The patriots had just gotten word to the underground at the same time the globalists had begun their attack, so word had not spread far enough yet to make the world suspicious. The aliens were so nice that they would warn the patriots 4 hours before each attack. That was expected to result in much chaos and death, and thus greatly embarrass the patriots and cause them to kill more of each other than the attack itself, but the aliens didnt seem to know that everyone had bugout plans, which had become a cultural fetish. Half had already bugged out anyway, and the rest were gone within the 4 hours. The aliens kept assuming that such a flawless bugout was a fluke each time. Needless to say, the patriots would not surrender and thus the globalists had to escalate. Next, the globalists introduced a hostile alien race, who said the humans were too dangerous and also just too stupid and ungrateful, and must be wiped out. They also began to use a different color of beam from space to attack cities in multiple countries, but the good aliens said that we were worth saving and defeated the bad aliens in a spectacular light show in the sky. Then the good aliens said that we humans needed to deal with those cowboy Rule of Market patriots before another hostile alien race came along. Puleeease! Grandpa, who would believe that was aliens instead of the globalists? Everyone believed it, and they wanted to kill the patriots more than ever. Everyone was being played by the globalists, who had manipulated billions into demanding the alien agenda, which was actually the globalist agenda, and demanding the death of any who opposed that agenda. Before that, even most patriots didnt understand that players dont have to give orders to make billions carry out their agenda. So, how did you all survive? Years of independent efforts had converged to destroy the satellite weapon, but that wasnt what really ended the globalists. Not even close. No one even knew we had destroyed it, and they were only days away from sending up another one, and they had nukes, nerve gas, conventional weapons, and billions ready to march. So, how did you do it?! Well, most of the world leaders were just front men for the globalists at the top. So, some of the more savvy patriots had been identifying the top globalists since as far back as 1970, and they had formed what are known as zero squads. A zero squad is a cell of three individuals known only to each other who have selected a top globalist whom they will sacrifice their lives to take out if necessary  if such globalists ever tried to perpetrate their end game. So, what happened?! They were supplemented by many new zero squads of both patriot and underground resistance forces, which ensured that every top globalist was covered two or three times over. Still, a few got away, but their front men knew that if their masters were not safe, then they werent either, so they told us the good aliens had just left and said they would be back in 100 years to check our progress."
12,cyber crime,HFY,The Stars Beckon - Chapter 2,222,8ahcri,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/8ahcri/the_stars_beckon_chapter_2/,2018-04-07 21:00:08,"[First](URL &gt;*There is no easy way from the Earth to the stars.* - Seneca --- The conversation with his crew had been an interesting one, to say the least. At first they simply stared at him in disbelief, but when he produced copies of the same data the Director had shown *him*, suddenly a rather different attitude filled the room. They had all dreamed of being the first pioneers to travel to another star, and since Proxima was part of a trinary system there had always been plans to explore the systems of Alpha Centauri A and B as well, assuming they didnt run into complications. But like the early Apollo missions, *Magellans* maiden voyage was basically a Proof-of-Concept flight. The Hyperdrive system had been successfully tested in the confines of the Solar system, and had performed admirably, but until they took the big leap no one knew how well the ships systems would function under real world conditions. It was an important step, a huge one, in fact...but at the end of the day it was almost a milk run. But *this*...this was the cutting edge of science and exploration. A mystery to be solved, worlds to explore, and their home to protect. By time he finished briefing the crew they were practically *salivating* at the chance to fly this mission. Nekesa had complained more than once that the original mission profile could have been programmed on autopilot, bitter words from any skilled navigator, but as she studied the charts he could see the wheels spinning behind her eyes as she began calculating their best possible route. Graeme was utterly convinced the other beacons orbited life-bearing worlds...after all, one was circling *Earth*, wasnt it? For an Astrobiologist this was the Holy Grail, and would assure the Edinburgh native never need to worry about buying his own drinks ever again. Soo-Jin was equally eager; with PhDs in Physics, Chemistry, and Geology she couldnt wait to examine the beacons up close, and who knew what new wonders awaited them in those other systems? The two scientists eyes glittered with the possibility of Nobel prizes, and nothing short of chaining them to a radiator would have kept them from this mission. Karl at first was intrigued, but as the ships Engineer he pointed out his job for the most part would remain unchanged. Will explained that theyd need his expertise to study the beacons...after all, someone who when faced with a standard prosthetic after losing his arm *sneered* at the clumsy device and designed his *own* instead was the perfect man for the job. The chance to study alien technology first hand sent his mind reeling with possibilities. To say they were motivated by time he finished was one *hell* of an understatement. The next morning they were assembled in the conference room, dressed in their blue jumpsuits, waiting impatiently for the Director and their Specialists to arrive. That was the one aspect of the new mission that had sparked some dissent, but they were willing to adopt a wait and see approach until they actually met them. At 0800 precisely the door opened, as Director Van Houtum led in three individuals, a man and two women. The crew of the *Magellan* sat up in their chairs and scrutinized the new arrivals, and at first blush they didnt look much like astronauts. Good morning, the Director told them affably, closing the door behind him and locking it. He motioned to the empty chairs for the newcomers who silently took their seats, eyeing their counterparts warily from across the table. As I told Captain Fontana yesterday, the discovery of the beacons has forced us to reexamine the mission parameters of *Magellan*, and when we did we realized that there were simply some talents that this crew lacked...through no fault of your own, I hasten to add, he said in a rush. But we have to assume there is a real possibility that there is an intelligent alien presence at work here, and that it is hostile. To that end, the members of the Alliance have scoured their ranks, searching for the best possible individuals to assist in this mission. He smiled benignly, and nodded at the three across the table. May I introduce Khadijeh Darzi, Eli ben Ezra, and Terz Rzsa. Will and the others nodded politely. Its a pleasure to meet you, he told them. Allow me to introduce the crew. Im Captain Will Fontana, mission commander, and working my way down the table we have Nekesa Okonkwo, navigator and pilot; Dr. Graeme McClellan, Astrobiologist; Dr. Soo-Jin Cho, physical sciences; and Karl Mller, our Engineer. He gave them a moment to let that sink in, before leaning forward and looking at each of them in turn. May I ask what specialties *you* bring to this mission? Ill take that question, Captain, the Director interjected, walking behind the new arrivals, stopping behind a hard edged woman with dark skin and hair in her thirties. Khadijeh Darzi here is probably the most skilled person on the planet when it comes to computer systems, a talent she honed to a razors edge working for the Iranian Cyber Army. Eyes narrowed across the table at the mention of the infamous hacking group. In fact, Ms. Darzi...or Daeva, as shes known in the hacking community, pulled off quite a coup. She managed to infiltrate and steal the nuclear launch codes for American Navys submarine fleet. Her government was ecstatic, of course...until she decided to go into business for herself and sell them on the black market to the highest bidder. Under the circumstances the Iranians were more than happy to hand her over to us, considering she was under a sentence of death for the crime. They stared at her shock, as Will looked up at Van Houtum, barely managed to keep the anger out of his voice. Youre foisting a *hacker* on us? Someone who jeopardized the safety and stability of the entire planet and betrayed her own nation...for *profit?* The Director met his gaze. Indeed I am. Let me make something perfectly clear, ladies and gentlemen...we are at *war*. If anyone disagrees on that point, I suggest you take a trip to Switzerland and see the damage for yourself. Not to mention the graves. He glared at each and every one of them. She has skills that might prove useful, and to protect this world I will happily recruit the Devil *himself*, if thats what it takes. Will shook his head, recognizing the futility of pressing the issue. I hope at least we got the codes back, he said sourly. We did, Gerrit said affably, that was part of the arrangement. That...and the threat of launching a nuclear strike on Tehran if they didnt play ball. The temperature in the room dropped a good twenty degrees at that little bombshell, as the Director moved down to the single male of the group, who had to be the most perfectly nondescript individual Will had ever laid eyes on. Even looking directly at him hed have been hard pressed to single out even *one* distinguishing feature. Eli ben Ezra here will be your Tactical specialist, and I can assure you he is *extremely* qualified for the role. Should the mission call for any sort of military operations, youll be taking your cues from him. *Yes*, he interjected, raising his hand as Will started to speak, Im well aware you were a combat pilot before you joined the astronaut corps, Captain, but Im afraid your skills pale in comparison to his. You see...Mr. ben Ezra is a *Ghost*. One could have heard a pin drop at that statement. I prefer the term Infiltration Technician, Eli said amicably. Ghost is something certain elements of the media have laid on...my brethren and I. I always thought they*you*...were a myth, Graeme said in wonderment, leaning closer to get a better look. Is it true, the stories about how much youve been augmented? *Can* you see in the dark, or survive a fifty foot drop...or hold your breath for twenty minutes? The Astrobiologists professional curiosity was fully engaged as stared in wonder at the Israeli. Im sorry to say that much of what youve heard has been exaggerated, he replied with a small smile. That being said...some of it has *not*. He appeared to be faintly amused by the doctors interest. I dont suppose you have any training in ship operations, or working under vacuum conditions? Any practical experience? Will asked. It was unlikely, but then again who knew what sort of background this man had? As a matter of fact, I have quite *extensive* experience working under both microgravity and lunar conditions, he replied. He glanced up at the Director, who gave him a slight nod. Eli shrugged, and said, That recent unpleasantness on the lunar colony. Most of the crew seemed to shrink back from him at the mention of the colony. A handful of malcontents had managed to seize control of the sites Mass Driver launching system, threatening to bombard Earth unless they complied with their demands. There had been a tense standoff for several days...and then suddenly it was over, with no explanation given. Except that the perpetrators had all been *killed*, somehow. The details were a bit vague. *Okay* Will said carefully, ...Id say you wont need much training then. I suspect he could teach *you* a thing or two, Captain,  the Director said with a chuckle, before moving down to the young woman at the end of the table. And last, but *certainly* not least, Miss Terz Rzsa. Shell be your...well, I guess you could say shes a communication specialist. They all turned to look at the young woman. She was pale skinned, and wore a tight-fitted cap that left only her face exposed, along with long opera gloves that covered her arms and hands. She seemed to watch them all with a healthy amount of distrust, but despite the look in her eyes that gave her age beyond her years, she couldnt have been older than twenty. Are you a linguist, Miss Rzsa? Will asked politely. No, she replied, meeting his gaze, Im a Telepath. Oh come *on*, Nekesa groaned, rolling her eyes, you expect us to *believe* that? She looked over at the Director. Youre feeding us *fairy tales* now? I understand your distrust, Gerrit replied, you are all scientists, after all. But I can assure you, shes the real thing. The only documented human telepath in history, in fact. The intelligence organization she works for didnt want to give her up, but they were*persuaded*, shall we say? He gave them a bemused smile. And whats more, I believe youll find her to be highly motivated to assist you...for the very simple reason that her gift is closely tied into the reason for this mission. *Gift*, she spat out, her face darkening, Try curse. She eyed them coldly. My mother was a physicist at CERN. When it was attacked she had just found out she was pregnant with me, and when the rescuers were picking through the wreckage they found her...alive, but brain dead. My father *begged* them to keep her on life support until I was born, only the attack did something to my DNA. She held up one of her gloved hands. My nerve cells are able to communicate with the nervous system of other compatible living beings. In a way, she paused, looking down the table at the Iranian, who so far hadnt spoken, I guess you could say I can hack into their system. Oh *really*, Nekesa retorted. Then tell me what *Im* thinking. Terz snorted. I dont need to be a telepath to tell *that*, I can see it in your eyes. And besides, it doesnt work that way. I have to physically touch the person Im trying to read. What did you think the *gloves* were for? she asked sarcastically. Will placed a hand on his navigators shoulder, giving her a stern look, before returning his attention to the young woman. And the attack...it somehow gave you this ability? She shrugged. Its the best explanation anyone has managed to come up with, at least. No one really knows for sure. The scientists say its lucky that my mother *was* brain dead...otherwise the physical contact would have likely driven me insane, before I was born. She looked away. Do you have any idea what its like, being an infant...and reading the thoughts of the doctor that just delivered you? The nurses? My own father, who every time he held me wished my *mother* had been the one that had survived, instead of me? Terz slowly returned her gaze to them. Of course not. You *cant*. No one can. I was a *child*, forced to deal with things no one should. They thought I was insane, at first. They drugged me, locked me away when I wouldnt stop screaming every time someone touched me. She wrapped her arms around herself in protection. And when they finally realized I *wasnt* crazy.that was even worse. My father was only too happy to sign me away, the painful ugly reminder of his dead wife, and from that moment on I belonged to the government. She turned to face Nekesa, who suddenly had a hard time meeting her eyes. They used to make me hand bouquets to visiting dignitaries, when I was little. Theyd smile, and pat me on the head...while I was reading every one of their dirty secrets. I was the best agent theyd ever had...and I was *never* allowed to have a life of my own. The entire room was stunned into silence...even Eli, who looked at her with appraising eyes. Im sorry, Will said softly. The young woman shrugged it off. Not your fault, she said at last, taking a deep cleansing breath. Graeme looked at her curiously. You said, Compatible Living Beings, before. Have you tried reading the thoughts of other species? She actually managed a chuckle at that. Oh yes, when they began testing they must have paraded half the animal kingdom in front of me, to see what I could do. The dolphins were nice...though mostly they thought about fish and sex. Terz smirked, Not all that different than humans, when you come right down to it. A nervous chuckle rippled across the room, as Van Houtum cleared his throat. Well then, Ill leave you all to get better acquainted. Youll have the next forty-eight hours off from the training cycle, but at that point well have to start getting our newest crew members up to speed. Understood, Fontana nodded. I realize that its been twenty years since the CERN incident, and theres been no further contact, but we cant assume that whoever did this wont return, the Director told them. As soon as youre ready, I want you investigating that beacon. And then ...we make the big leap, Will finished. Indeed, Van Houtum replied. The Captain looked around the room at his crew, both old and new, and while there were plenty of rough edges to be smoothed out...he didnt much care for the look in the hackers eyes, truth be told...there was something here. Something to build on. Well be ready, he told him."

Click here!](URL ******* ++++++++++ ******* Lord Kli/ Ik read the daily newspaper, looking at the financial section as he ate his breakfast (some dried meat which had been marinated in fish sauce, topped with some berries). The economy was doing excellently, although the Ik Corporation was still recovering after that scandal involving his son. People were hesitant to invest in a conglomerate ran by someone whose heir was associated with tomfoolery (one of the sins on the lowest tier of how the [church] ranked them, but one of the most inappropriate for a gentleman of his station  at least murder was done in private!). The fact that the boy had disappeared without a word was the talk of the town for several weeks, and Kli/s reputation had taken quite the blow. He flipped through the newspaper, going to the opinion pieces tooh, someone had written *another* article about him and his son. Well, that was understandable &gt;'Was Toh/ Ik: the victim of a crime most foul?' The mans eyes widened at the title. Goodness! What is this? Balderdash... He began to read it. Whoever wrote the thing was claiming that there was a *possibility* that Toh/ may have been killed, and that it wouldnt have been out of the question for someone close to him to have done it in order to cover up a dishonourable act. Balderdash and poppycock! Sir? A footman just outside the circular doorway entrance popped his head inside. Is everything alright? My honour has been sullied! The man angrily slammed down the newspaper  well, were it possible to do that. He attempted to slam it down, but it simply fell gracefully onto his desk, slipping off the sleek wooden surface and falling apart on the floor. Sullied greatly! I must challenge this... he stomped around to the other side of the desk to the fallen article, locating the article to find the journalists name. This... Rok-pa person to a duel! There was no way to tell if the person in question was a man or a woman: you couldnt tell just from someones name, after all. He hadnt had a duel in years! Hed have to get some practice in before sending the invitation, just to make sure he was still able to aim properly. Forgive me if I am speaking out of turn, sir, the servant bowed his head slightly as he entered, not wanting to look impudent, but your family already misses your beloved son, and may not be in favour if you risking your life. Perhaps you should choose a proxy to act on your behalf? An interesting idea. Normally he would have someone of his station beaten for giving him life advice, but the boy was a favourite of Kli/s. Thank you for volunteering, Tro;k! The footman looked at the other man with wide eyes, giving his wings a few alarmed, involuntary flaps. Forgive me, my lord, but I didnt mean to suggest Well start your pistol training immediately. The aristocrat clapped his two hand-feet together, summoning a chamber maid to clean up the newspaper. Let us go to the grounds, post haste! Ill have the [page boy] bring out some pistols and an appropriately large amount of ammunition for you to sharpen your skills. ****************************************** ++++++++++ ****************************************** *Meanwhile, on Earth...* Zhang sat down in the diner, trying to pretend that he didnt notice the looks he was getting. He was sure the stares werent ones of animosity, but rather of curiosity. After all, it was a small town in the heart of Texas, and the residents probably werent used to seeing people who werent white or Hispanic. He was on a stool at the counter, and had entered at a time the restaurant wasnt too busy. The waitress gave him a friendly (if mildly forced looking) smile as she handed him a menu. Thank you, he said while giving her a much more natural looking smile. This is such a lovely place. He looked around, playing up the tourist on a roadtrip aspect of his cover. We dont have diners like this in China. She seemed to get much more friendly at his words, relaxing somewhat. Well thank you. Id recommend the chicken-fried steak with a side of biscuits and gravy if you want the real Texan experience. Was it chicken? Or steak? And why did Americans call scones [cookies]? He was thankful he brushed up on the peculiarities of American English on the flight over. He decided not to ask what sort of meat it was to avoid offending her, and simply smiled and said that sounds wonderful, thank you. Sarah Wilsons father would be in there any minute. He and his colleagues frequented the location for lunch on Fridays. Once that happened, all Zhang would have to do is Someone sat on the stool right next to him. This was quite odd, considering there were plenty of other spaces available at other parts of the diners counter, and several booths available. At first Zhang assumed that it was a local would try to intimidate him, some xenophobe who didnt like his looks or accent. Then, he got a better look at the man. Physically imposing and in shape, with clothes that fit him just a bit too well. He wasnt an average Joe  it wasnt just obvious from the nice looking clothes or fifty dollar haircut, but his posture as well. Ill have a burger and fries with a glass of Coke, he said to the waitress. He didnt have a Texan accent. Well, shit. Zhang got up to leave, but the man next to him casually opened the side of his jacket, revealing a holstered weapon. Siddown, he said in a quick whisper. You and I, mister Zhang, are going to enjoy our meals separately. He was leaning forwards, propping his head up with his hand and casually concealing his mouth with his hands so that his words were muffled and no one else would be the wiser. I will eat and leave before you. You will finish your meal, pay, and meet me across the street in the parking lot. Double shit. He supposed he *could* get up and leave. It wasnt as if he was going to shoot him dead right then and there, in a diner about to experience the lunch rush. But, it would escalate things. Interpol? whispered Zhang. The man grimaced, as if insulted. FBI. Im here as a tourist. Bullshit. The influx of diners coming in overshadowed the volume of the mens voices, letting them speak to each other with relative impunity. That mustve been Mister Wilson and his colleagues coming in to order delicious, artery-clogging cuisine, which they would take bites of between talking business and sports. The fact that they prayed before eating helped confirmed it was them. He was going to miss out on gathering intel. Youre here, said the American government agent, as part of something so covert that your own agency doesnt have any info on it. So, that explained it. Those Cold War style in the field confrontations didnt happen anymore, which is why Zhang had been caught so off-guard. Normally they wouldve simply detained him at the airport when he first landed if they thought anything was up. The man was going to try to get information out of him because what he knew wasnt encoded anywhere: there may have been data breaches at the databases at Zhangs level of clearance, but the fact that it was all tacit data (that is, information existing solely in an individuals mind) rather than explicit (something encoded, either on-paper or electronically) meant that the U.S. needed to ring him in under unofficial terms. No formal detainment at the airport, but a confrontation in a backwater town's diner where if a fella got in a scuffle with some foreigner not much would be said. Im on vacation. Driving from Corpus Christi to New Orleans, making a little detour in some rinky-dink town? You expect me to believe that? I wanted to experience small town Americana. Well see about that. His tone was weighty, as if he was trying to be menacing. But were his implied threats empty? Zhang realized he was in no real danger. The Cold War was over, and torturing a Chinese spy in any way would never be tolerated... theyd probably just detain him somewhere covert and unofficial and demand information. That wasnt especially a problem since Zhang still *had no information*. Well, probably nothing more than what the Americans had. Are you new at this? asked Zhang, his voice returning to its normal smooth-sounding, amicable treble once the shock of being approached by a field agent wore off. You seem young. Im sort of insulted that the FBI didnt send someone with a bit more experience. He couldnt help but get a bit of pleasure from the look on the other agents face, at him no longer being in control. Guess the agents who fought the commies are too old to see any action, and the ones in their thirties and forties specialize in counter-terrorism instead of proper espionage. They chose you because you speak and read Mandarin, am I right? Youre what, twenty-six? Twenty-seven? None of your goddamn busin He shut his mouth when the waitress approached, putting his burger and fries in front of him. This looks great, maam. Thank you. The Chinese agent nodded as the woman set down his meal in front of him. Thanks. Zhang eyed the chicken-fried steak in front of him. It looked like schnitzel. Once the waitress went to check on another table, he whispered to the FBI agent. I have no idea what I ordered. Is it chicken, or is it steak? The American agent gave him an angry look, barely controlled rage bubbling under the surface. It was definitely his first proper field mission, and it wasnt going like he thought. But you dont know, do you? asked Zhang. Where are you from, Boston? Philadelphia? The man cut off a piece of meat, beginning to eat his meal. Ah, Ive solved the mystery! This is dog meat. He smirked at the other man. Sweet, juicy dog meat. (He knew it was beef seasoned to taste like fried chicken upon cutting a piece off --- he just wanted to see the other mans expression.) ****************** ++++++++++ ****************** *On The Sanctum of Everlasting Diplomacy...* Kra watched them from a distance. Watched them being all *happy* and *frolicking* and making jokes. It wasnt fair! Why couldnt it be her at Elijahs side instead of Sarah!? She would give anything to have that again. They hadnt even gone swimming together since before the battle on Ninsara II, and she feared that theyd grow apart. On the rare instances when they were together and alone she could pretend that things were back to how they used to be, but then he would bring up *her* and... Being The Aquatic Maiden is suffering. Kra turned towards the Ke Tee man, her scales flickering orange in annoyance. Whats that supposed to mean!? Toh/ bobbed back and forth in a movement equivalent to a shrug. Im not sure, really! It just sounded poetic. Well I dont appreciate it. She looked back towards the couple in the distance, longingly. They were walking beneath a sculpture in the neutral section of the ring, far enough away that the bend of the space station meant she could look up at them somewhat. Perhaps you should just let it go? Let what go? My feelings for him? Your feelings for a man who doesnt return them? Yes! Absolving yourself of some things would be for the best. He likes me too, though. She could tell that he did. He treated her differently than he treated other female friends, like Xiuying and Isabella. I... I think he doesnt return my feelings because were from different worlds. How silly was that? ZidChaMa were the xenophobes of the universe, and yet *he* was the one not accepting her because of her species. Well thats apt, isnt it? Birds of a feather flock together! He gave a little wing flap as he gesticulated, but the play on words was totally lost on them both, considering they werent speaking English. You dont think people should date across species lines? Toh/ gave a snort-like chortle. Madame, listen to the ridiculousness of that question! What if someone asked you that same question before you were brought to this vessel, hmm? Thats different! That was before I knew there was intelligent life elsewhere in the galaxy. If you phrased it as you dont think people should date aliens... she trailed off. To her, before uplift started, she would have given that question a resounding yes. While she was more open-minded than other ZidChaMa, the idea of dating someone from a different culture, never mind a different species, would have been repugnant. Toh/ took her silence as a sign she was on the same page as him. You see? People shouldnt stray outside of the lines they were born into. The woman was about to bring up the subject of Toh/s former marriage, to someone of a totally different culture, but decided not to. She didnt want to reopen any wounds. Are most Ke Tee in agreement with that idea? But of course! In fact, Im sure anti-miscegenation laws we have in The Empire already cover such infractions. The whole concept of laws such as those were alien to her. On ZraDraub it was about religion, not phenotype. Ones race was a non-issue as long as they were the same religion as someone else, which seemed downright progressive compared to how things were in the Empire of Enlightenment on Planet Ke Tee. His species is a non-issue to me, and thats that. The girl gave a melancholy exhalation of air. I dont think Ill ever stop adoring him, Toh/. Hes my first love. *********** ++++++++++ ********** *Back on Earth...* Zhang left the diner and met with the American agent, who, after repeatedly being asked his name, finally mumbled Rick, although that was probably just an alias. The FBI agent silently lead the man down a few streets, and then into a parked camper. Both their covers were tourists, then. Hed probably been following him for ages, on a similar road trip. Are the FBI using RVs now? He asked, chipper. I suppose the white van thing is just a clich at this point He was cut off when the American man punched him in the gut. What was that!? Didnt he know this wasnt a Hollywood action film? Things simply werent done that way! Are you *trying* to start an international incident!? He wheezed slightly, the wind knocked out of him. The other man responded in Mandarin spoken in an American English accent. What do you know about the anomalous radiation signatures!? The mans posture indicated he was ready to land another blow if need be. Zhang, for his part, stood there stoically, not afraid at all. The Chinese agents body language was as confident as ever, and he knew that it only made Rick even more annoyed after the fifty minutes theyd just spent with Zhang shit-talking to him in the middle of a crowded diner. Just that theyre linked to the disappearances of undergraduate students from around the globe. He wasnt technically on a mission, according to his organizations bureaucracy, and that information wasnt classified at any level. So, he was more than able to admit that. Youre lying. He made a motion as if about to slam Zhangs head into the faux laminated wood interior of the RV, but then looked as if he'd decided against it. Did he think he was fucking Batman? What was this? Zhang made a mental note to write a strongly worded letter to the FBI upon getting back to China. Im not lying. Hey, Jason Bourne, did you consider *asking* before hitting me? He felt his years of character acting training temporarily wane, his true (admittedly quite snarky) personality shining through. Because I wouldve told you that in exchange for what you know. None of that was confidential. ... What? What do you mean what? Are you an intern? Oh god, the FBI sent an intern after me. Im insulted. He leaned against the wall of the RVs kitchenette. Im not here on any official capacity, which is why your cyber espionage division didnt find anything on our servers. The other man put down his fists, letting his guard down. Im assuming thats how you found out about this whole thing. Im here on a personal favour to my boss, to tell you the truth. Lets get her on the line and figure out a solution, shall we? "
14,cyber crime,HFY,"[OC] The Phaton War, part 8",18,6v0ypg,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/6v0ypg/oc_the_phaton_war_part_8/,2017-08-21 15:37:28,"[part 1](URL [part 7](URL *This update is a little late so I'll try to make this part longer* &amp;nbsp; The asteroid briefly dubbed Target Dummy Numero 101 disintegrated into glowing slag. Fusion Lance 1 powered down. Coolant rushed and mechanisms hissed at the exertion. Sinoa could not make the infernal guns fire more than once before going on cooldown. The fusion lances were nothing like any other directed energy weapon. Before, the most powerful thing people used were Class III masers. Fusion lances were fundamentally different. ""Fire up the exotic furnace for Lance number 2,"" Sinoa said as she wrote down some notes on her computer pad. ""Load the plasma accelerators."" Saying it out loud was just habit now. The *Epimetheus* had the most sophisticated neural relay ever. The ship began work on the order happened the moment she thought it. The exotic furnace in Fusion Lance 2 boiled to primordial temperatures in the millions of Centigrade, held at bay by fields of considerable power. Electromagnetic spirals channeled through two flanking plasma accelerators. Sinoa promptly named yet another asteroid and targeted it. ""Fire,"" she said. The exotic furnace was released outwards in a directed beam. The tongue of primordial energy lashed out. At the same time, two jets of hyperdense accelerated deuterium converged at the point of impact with the exotic beam. A tiny volume at the point of impact was, for an instant, elevated to energies necessary to facilitate the fusion reaction. The event was invisibly fast, but the result was brilliant. Approximately 100 megatons of explosive yield tore into the asteroid, carving what remained into chunks. New data rolled in. Sinoa frowned. The problem was there was too much heat in the exotic furnace. And she was now sure as to where it was coming from. Fusion lances essentially created an electroweak environment at the target for an instant, increasing the fusion yields from the twin beams of deuterium plasma. That meant generating tremendous heat and then projecting it at the required distance away. The original range was just a few thousand kilometers. Any further was too much and the fusion lance became little more than an expensive plasma gun. Sinoa overhauled the furnace and introduced much more potent field projectors in order to extend the range to about one light-second. But as a result, she was creating a realm of Higgs field dissonance within the exotic furnace. Just for an instant. The collapse back to reality from the Higgs field ""freezing"" into coherence allowed the Higgs boson to exist again, and created flashes of heat that forced the weapon to cooldown or else suffer meltdown. Sinoa composed a solution and prepared to pitch it to Admiral Joanna SeuChong. The perpetual one gee acceleration kept her on the ground as she walked along the ship's tiny halls. Her plan was to make use of heat and funnel it into the secondary thrusters. ""...should solve the problem,"" Sinoa finished explaining. ""How long is the cooldown process?"" Admiral SeuChong asked. ""Give or take a minute,"" Sinoa answered. ""But the real issue is the coolant. The heat has to go somewhere. We're throwing it off the ship regardless. We'll run out of coolant before we run out of energy."" ""And then we won't be able to fire,"" the Admiral finished. She shook her head. ""This is going to take more time to implement. But most of the ships are still in the docks. I'll relay this to the EDC. Thank you."" Sinoa nodded and prepared to leave. The Admiral's voice interrupted her. ""You're really enjoying this, aren't you?"" ""As much as any professional can from their work,"" Sinoa said. ""As you were,"" Admiral SeuChong said with a smile. Her apparent good mood disappeared the moment the Webber engineer left. Joanna knew exactly who they were dealing with. When the EDC compiled a list of individuals to work on the *Epimetheus* ships based on their intelligence and other capabilities, Sinoa Tranxient appeared at the top of their list. The issue were the results of the mental tests themselves. They did more than just measure competence. The Admiral sipped the cup of green tea. Tightened nerves released. She wondered how long before the Daytona android outlives its purpose. Sinoa returned to her quarters to continue her work on the other parts of the ship, such as the primary M-aM (matter-antimatter) drive. The ship propelled itself by spitting nearly pure light out its rear end. But there was a lot of untapped potential there. So the original engineers built particle momentum traps all along the long exhaust tubes. Particles passed by the high-intensity light as it traveled down the drive tubes. Every pass bled momentum from the photons and transferred it to the ship. The light that exited the exhaust was redshifted beyond recognition, but inefficiently. Sinoa was already working on a way to improve the momentum traps when Jackie Daytona entered with a tray of black tea. ""Just what I needed,"" Sinoa said, exhaling in relief. ""Your timing is uncanny."" ""The system knows when you're thirsty,"" Jackie replied as she poured the beverage into cups. ""I'm sort of cheating."" They conversed briefly, and then Jackie cleaned up so Sinoa could return to her work. Sinoa found her eyes wandering down as Jackie left. The people at Daytona Industries did not mess around when it came to attention to detail. Sinoa shook her head to remove the silly thoughts. Just as she began to concentrate, a news alert appeared on the neural net. Inevitably, she decided to watch that instead. It was a virtual stadium full of people. Approximately a billion. All protesting against the war effort. There was no room for such displays on Planet Earth, so every member of the cause donated in order to build the virtual space to house their protest. A crisply dressed governor was appointed to talk about the effort in more detail. Sinoa grinned at the man's introduction. Like many leaders, he had very few cyber implants or cosmetic mutations. For some reason people found that more endearing, as though it influenced someone's ability to lead. Humanity may be enlightened after centuries of peace, but not wholly logical. ""...is not an act of war in totality, but one of preparation for the possibility of conflict,"" the man was saying. ""We want nothing more than to understand these aliens, and are greatly enthused by the fact that such a species exists within our own solar system. It is a monumental discovery, and wisdom tells us to befriend them. But good firewalls make good neighbors, as you all are aware. Our effort is a preparation for defense, not offense. Thank you."" He was immediately bombarded with questions. The text alerts were so overwhelming that the governor was disconnected from the load. Hecklers maintained the notion that he ran. Why was so much of the Umbrella dedicated to the project if it was just a precaution? Why are so many resources still devoted into building the ships? Why are the details around the ships' capabilities so shrouded?"" That question Sinoa had a hands-on answer to. If she overclocked the fusion lances, she could get 200 megatons per shot out of them. There were twenty per ship and a hundred ships in the emergent fleet. The people did *not* need to know what kind of firepower is assembling above the planet. There would be cyber-rioting and a lot of griping. The Umbrella would be flooded with nonsensical and unnecessary computations, wasting time and effort. It was all very annoying. The people. Even now they often demanded an omelette without breaking the shell. Perhaps being overly emotional was just a part of being human. Perhaps one can't expect too much from the average man. It was no doubt much worse just a few centuries ago, when some people clung onto the idea that the amount of melanin in the skin was a criteria for superiority. Sinoa was reminded of her childhood. It was awful. Even her own people, the Webbers, with their innate immense calculation abilities seemed slow to her. So very slow, like shambling zombies. It was one of the reasons she left; her home was dull. The rest of humankind, the vanilla homo sapiens, might as well be hordes of molasses. But at least they had some personality. Sinoa wondered what she would move on to do once working for the EDC begins to bore her. Maybe she'd take up beekeeping. Or start an ant farm. Another alert pulled her attention. It was from the Admiral. They were changing course and will begin a high-gee burn in one minute. Soon, one hundred gees of force would be threatening to tear the ship apart, but the cabins were all equipped with second generation Einstein-Casimir projectors. Sinoa would not feel a thing. The reason they were changing course was more interesting: vandalism. A series of automated mines had been shut off. Mines that were supposed to bring the materials needed to build the ships. Someone or someones had gotten a little impatient, and took the anti-war effort into their own hands. The EDC were on their way to apprehending whoever perpetrated the crime. Crime. It has been a long time. Sinoa smiled at the implication it brought. She settled into her seat. The solar system still had some intrigue in it after all."

Hel, she could probably vaporize this entire space station without even straining herself! Tyrric asserted. Your words fill me with confidence Commander, General Damphair responded in an ironic tone. Do you really expect Humanity to trust something capable of killing us so easily? You say you have no control over her, what happens if she changes her mind about us? Tyrric narrowed his eyes. He could understand where General Damphair was coming from, really he could. How could he make them see? They wanted to dismantle Ellida just because she *might* betray them? How did anyone trust anyone? General Damphair turned back towards the holo-vid of General Matheson, the one they were both making their cases to. Tyrric made his move. Three steps was all the distance that separated them, and he had crossed the distance before Damphair even flinched in anticipation. His synthetic arm darted out, faster than the human eye could track, and grabbed General Damphair by the lapels of his uniform. He lifted the shocked general a foot into the air, then choke-slammed him into the ground. The unnaturally strong grip of Tyrrics synthetic hand held the generals throat in a crushing grip. The meeting room was full of military personnel, yet nobody stopped him. Nobody *could* stop him. Almost all the officers and politicians were holo-vids, not that it wouldve mattered; not a one of them had seen a day of combat in the last decade. Tyrric locked eyes with the shocked general, he squeezed his hand ever so slightly. Then just like that he released him. By the time a pair of guards rushed into the meeting room from the doorway Tyrric was already helping General Damphair to his feet. Relax, if I wanted to kill him he would already be dead, Tyrric spoke to the stunned room. Theres nothing more stopping me from killing General Damphair than there is stopping Ellida from betraying Humanity right now. *Trust* is what holds our society together! Ellida was a slave for longer than Humanity has had a written language. *Trust* that she wants to kill the Fourst *at least* as much, if not more, than Humanity does. We wont win this war without her. General Damphair tried to straighten out his uniform while catching his breath. The two guards had stopped short of restraining Tyrric, they were at a loss of what to do and were looking to General Mathesons holo-vid for guidance. For his part the leader of the GDA looked thoughtful, his eyes flitted between Tyrric and Damphair. He finally broke the silence of the room, Ellida will be hired on with the GDA as a Private under Commander Tyrric. Garland, send her the contract. It was a tone that brooked no argument. Damphair argued. With all due respect, sir. Commander Tyrric just assaulted a superior officer! Here Damphair stopped to cough, but Tyrric was under the impression he was just hamming it up for extra sympathy. He should be court-martialed, at the very least. It sets a dangerous precedent, sir. Johnson? General Mathesons holo-vid asked the air, addressing his personal computer intelligence. Article 57-3 allows for disciplinary action to be withheld against assets of sufficient strategic interest during times of war, Johnson responded over the rooms speaker system in his usual calm tone. There, Article 57-3. This meeting is over. General Matheson promptly disconnected his holo-vid line. A dozen other generals and high ranking politicians started following suit until half the room had disappeared. General Damphair pursed his lips as he passed by Tyrric, but otherwise didnt address the physical confrontation. General Damphairs hair, however, was sticking up all over in a disheveled mess that made him look like a joke. Get me Secretary Tyrric on the line! he was demanding of his assistant by the door. Tyrric couldnt wait to get away from all these stuffy paper-pushers. *that hot-headed son of yours before somebody else does!* Tyrric could just make out General Damphair huffing out into a comm while he was leaving the room. Yet one more reason to get out of there. The guards at the front door gave Tyrric an astounded look while he was signing out, one of them actually gave him a covert thumbs-up. Elevators? Down that hall, and to the right, one of the soldiers indicated. He was still getting used to the layout here in Biarma. There was enough room for Tyrric to squeeze into the elevator. Someone else had already pushed the button to the ground floor, but before the elevator doors had even closed Tyrrics personal comm started ringing. He quickly silenced the comm and switched to sublingual out of respect for the other passengers. It was his father, he wasnt excepting this call quite so soon. Dorian, I was meaning to speak with you earlier. Is now a good time? his father started without any introduction, all the way from Terra Nova. *Now is as good a time as any, Father.* Tyrric replied sublingually. He could already feel his blood pressure rising. His father rarely called with good news. *Is this about the altercation with General Damphair?* Is that what youre calling it? Do you know how hard its going to be to get your next promotion after that? Damphair is a powerful enemy to have. *I was just making a point. Damphair just happened to be the only real person within reach,* Tyrric defended himself. Could you please explain that to the general then? Preferably with a well worded apology, but make sure to do it in a public setting. Its his pride you hurt most. Apologizing in front of his troops would repair some of that damage. His father, always the politician. *Sure thing, Ill get right on that.* This is serious, take care of this by tomorrow. Im going to have my assistant draft an apology for you. Try to stay on-script this time, we dont need a repeat of last time, his father directed him. Tyrric was just glad his father couldnt see him rolling his eyes. *Yeah, yeah. Ill take care of it. Is that all?* No, theres one more thing. Its about Project Foolish Monkey, I heard it was your idea. *It was.* I also heard that its the only reason Humanity is alive right now. *I suppose thats true, depending on how you look at it. Where are you going with this father?* Your future, his father replied in classic fashion. The Admiral in charge of the orbital defense of Andlang is going to be stepping down. She couldnt handle the stress of a possible Fourst invasion. The savior of humanity would be a shoe-in for her replacement. *Please tell me your PR guys arent already trying to sell that title? And how am I supposed to lead Ellida from Andlang? Shes going to be on the front lines.* The same way every general does, through a quantum relay. With virtually no signal delay there is no reason to physically command from Ellida. *So Im supposed to sit back on a safe planet light-years away and command soldiers to die for me?* Tyrric demanded, incredulous. Its not so heartless as you make it sound, Dorian. Its the Strategic Delegation; you can command your troops from a safe location and, gods forbid, something happens to them you can continue issuing commands to whichever troops remain. No break in the chain of command! A strategic mind like yours is too valuable to risk on the front lines of combat. *Not this conversation aga-* Tyrric tried responding before being cut off. You nearly got yourself killed twice already in the last week! We cant go on without you! *How am I supposed to command the respect of my troops when Im asking them to take risks Im not willing to take myself?* Youve already *proven* youre willing to take the risks. We need you somewhere safe. His fathers voice sounded almost strained. *And what happens if I give an order someone doesnt want to listen to? All they have to do is flip a switch and Im gone.* That- *I gotta go. Perhaps we can continue this chat later.* Making his point, Tyrric hung up on his father. That particular conversation had played itself out enough times for Tyrrics taste, hed even let himself get talked into being put in charge of Bridgewater. And everyone knew how that turned out. Ellidas blue-sparkling metal hull loomed in the distance just outside. The light seemed to strip away some of the mystery, but she was still a damn beautiful ship. The hangar at Biarma was the largest one inside an atmosphere humanity owned. It could fit half a dozen Destroyer-class battleships at once. The enormous tube that made up the base of Biarma was so large there was even a hint of blue sky at the edges. Ellidas round shape meant she was quite a bit taller and thinner than the average GDA vessel so they had to design custom scaffolding to get any work done. All over her frame engineers could be seen examining every inch with scanners trying to make sense of her alien technology. As he watched, a pair of construction workers escorted a small ground transport through her hull and down a ramp, filled to the brim with glacier ice. It took a few seconds for Tyrric to build up the nerve to pass through Ellidas phasing hangar door. He hopped through as fast as he could, but the tingling still brought up some unpleasant memories from his earlier incident. Ellida had assured him that there was no more risk of another seizure than before the incident and that there was no lasting damage, but he still couldnt bring himself to risk it more than necessary. Inside Ellidas hangar there were a dozen crews hauling loads of glacier ice and empty carts back and forth as well as a few engineers examining the Fourst transport vessels. The cryostasis pods with sleeping Fourst in them were conspicuously absent, but Tyrric didnt miss them. If anything he was a little relieved. Shortly after he stepped foot in her hangar, Ellida interrupted him on his private channel. Captain! Im going to be a private! Ive never had a rank before. They say Im going to get a paycheck too. Im not really sure what Im supposed to do with Human credits though, she started blurting out. Hello to you too, Tyrric greeted her. Why dont you buy something with them? Thats what most people do. But Im a ship, she insisted, What am I supposed to buy? I never thought I would miss the glacier ice, Tyrric confessed, but at least it had color. All the gray grating lining your halls is pretty dull. Why dont you spruce it up with some paint? Blue really is my color. It really brings out my Muspel. Or who knows, maybe I can try a new color. How much does paint cost? Is it too late to make changes to my contract? Tyrric couldnt tell if she was joking or being serious so he played along. If you already signed, its probably too late to make changes, but Im sure someone could get you a paintjob while theyre making repairs. Muspel is that blue-sparkling metal your hull is made of, right? He could remember reading about how Muspel was the strongest substance known to the Fourst. So you *were* paying attention, Ellida applauded him in a condescending tone. You dont give me enough credit, Tyrric grumbled. He passed by a pair of technicians arc welding the door Ivana had melted with plasma fire. The bridge wasnt far now. Anything I should know? They carted off that popsicle you left in Bioregeneration. Antoni? Tyrric could still remember shoving the dying Dokkfar Security guard in a Fourst cryostasis pod. He was surprised to hear that the man was still, even partially, alive. Yup, Ellida confirmed, I dont know if theyre going to be able to get anything out of him though, he was at least half vegetable. I distinctly remember telling you not to put any Humans in those cryostasis pods. He was dying anyways, Tyrric retorted, then mostly to himself he commented, You dont have to remember *everything*. Its not my fault Im so fantastic! Ellida chuckled to herself. Tyrric wasnt sure when shed developed a sense of humor, but it seemed like one was coming along. Just so long as she didnt try pretending to be reprogrammed again. I didnt mean to imply it was a bad thing, he pointed out. Having a perfect memory definitely had its advantages. Not as many as being a super-intelligent computer though. Ellida didnt seem that much smarter than a regular person though, was she speaking down to his level? She claimed she was smarter than ever after absorbing the Fourst AI countermeasure, but she didnt *act* any smarter. I should probably warn you not to get in the way of the engineers on the bridge. Im walking them through a very delicate repair job right now, Ellida warned him as he approached the bridge. Wait, currently? How many conversations can you keep up at once now? Lets just leave it at, higher than you can count. But yours is my favorite. Tyrric felt a little weird about learning that his conversation was just a small part of her experience. He thought they had something special. The bridge had a dozen engineers scrambling all over the smashed consoles with delicate repair tools. The Dokkfar and Fourst bodies had been removed and his old arm was still lying next to the scrap around console seven. Knowing Ellida, she was probably trying to convince the poor technicians that it was an important component. The captains seat was occupied by some bald teenager who was lounging in it sideways, engrossed in a datapad. Ellida? Whos sitting in my chair? Tyrric asked. *Does she just let anyone sit there?* he wondered to himself, surprised to feel a twinge of jealousy. Before Ellida gave him a response the kid looked up and saw him. Oh hey, Im Jake, he introduced himself with only a casual head nod. I was just bored so I thought I would check out the alien spaceship because, you know, *alien spaceship!* And what were you doing in my chair? Tyrric raised an eyebrow expectantly. Strange, I didnt see your name on it. The kid looked around for a second in an exaggerated motion. Tyrric knew his name wasnt on it. *Ill have to get that fixed,* he thought to himself. Tyrric opened his mouth to correct the kid but he was already disengaged, looking back to his datapad. Distractedly he explained himself, Ellida said I could. Besides, its comfy. Tyrric had to assume this kid belonged somewhere else. What are you even doing at a top secret GDA research facility in the first place? he demanded. Jake gave an enthusiastic smile and waggled his fingers, I have *super powers*, he said. Tyrric raised a skeptical eyebrow, Oh really? What kind of super powers? I never lose at video games. Really? Tyrric asked, dismissively, How is not losing at video games a super power? When scientists want to study your brain to figure out how you do it, I think it counts as a super power. A particularly young looking engineer crawled out from one of the destroyed consoles and commented, Its true, his reflexes are literally off the charts. You done looking at those crystals, Koz? Jake addressed the engineer, they seemed to be familiar with each other. It was then that Tyrric noticed the engineer wasnt wearing the right uniform. Two tourists? Ellida should start charging admission. I really hope you didnt-. Tyrric started to tell the newcomer. Dont worry, Koz reassured him, I didnt damage anything, I was just looking. Yeah, Ellida sarcastically cut in on their private channel, he didnt damage anything. You should take notes. And if I hadnt been so rough youd still be an annoying robot, Tyrric commented out loud while rolling his eyes. What? Ellida gasped in feigned surprise, Im not an annoying robot anymore? What good news! The lights suddenly cut out and a high-pitched squealing played over the speakers that caused everyone in the room to grab their ears. Everything went back to normal a few seconds later, leaving behind a ringing in the ears. What was that? Koz asked while trying to pop his ears. Just Ellida being an *annoying robot*, Tyrric told him, making sure to put special emphasis on the annoying robot part. I dont know what hes talking about, Ellida announced over the speakers of the bridge, I had a power surge from the maintenance. I thought you explained to me the other day why it was impossible for you to experience power surges, Tyrric countered. Would you like to see the log? Ellida asked. It was probably supposed to be a rhetorical question but Tyrric said yes anyways. Wait a second, I need to manufacture them, Ellida responded. You hearing this? Tyrric demanded of the two tourists. They gave each other an incredulous look, then Jake shrugged and went back to his datapad. Instead of leaving Tyrrics chair he shifted to get more comfortable. Tyrric walked over to shoo the kid out of there. He appeared to be engrossed in a game of Warfare Arena. Oh, did you want to play? he asked as Tyrric was reaching to snatch the datapad out of his hands. Warfare Arena wasnt really Tyrrics favorite game, he thought it relied too heavily on reaction speed instead of actual strategy. No thanks, I prefer strategy games- Tyrric started to say, hoping to push the conversation in a direction that resulted in the kid leaving his bridge. Great! Jake replied in an excited voice, Toolsquares, you and me. Ive been looking for a worthy opponent. *I should have just told him I dont play,* Tyrric thought to himself. Can I play! Ellida butted in, I could beat all three of you at the same time. Who said I was playing? Koz asked the air. Tyrric had to cut them both off. He was aware of the security measures at Biarma. Wow, wow, wow, he said, *Nobody* is playing Toolsquares here, its an online game. Access to the quantum relay network is highly restricted. Its only available for a few hours a week. He crossed his arms to emphasize his point, though he wasnt sure if the body language would matter to Ellida. Later then, Jake negotiated, The next time the network is up. No, Tyrric said with finality. There is no way Ellida is going to be allowed to go online. I think I speak for the entire human race when I say that we dont need a self-aware cyber-warfare suite rooting through our network history. What are you implying? Ellida asked in an affronted tone. Are you humans really so threatened by me? This really wasnt the conversation he wanted to have, seeing as he had literally just come from a meeting where they seriously discussed dismantling her. Of course not, Ellida, he started explaining. Its just going to take some time before- Dont worry about it Ell, Jake interrupted, They dont let me on the network *either*. The teenager couldnt have sounded more victimized. Tyrric wished his biggest problem was boredom. How about this, Tyrric compromised, Ellida, do you think you could print out a board game if I gave you instructions? Please, that would be childs play, she replied, What kind of board game? Its a classic board game that humans have been using to demonstrate proficiency in military strategy for centuries, Tyrric explained, Ive been getting private lessons on it since I was three years old. Ill beat all three of you. He was interrupted by his personal comm ringing. The ID said it was Matheson, even though the network was supposed to have been shut down a few minutes ago. It should have been impossible for even the Chief General to order the network open to make a call unless someone on Biarma had ordered it open for an emergency. Tyrrics heart dropped as he answered, This is Tyrric. Lieutenant Colonel Tyrric, someone just killed Antoni. We were planning to use his *testimony* to prove that the Vanir violated the accords. We believe there may be a Vanir agent on Biarma, Matheson briefed him in his serious voice without any preamble. That sounds pretty serious, do you have any suspects? One. A Vanir grad student contracted under Tarkin Industries, Tyrrics stomach clenched at the name of the company, Koschei Detleff, he goes by Koz, Matheson continued. Koz? Tyrric exclaimed, looking over at the young kid who was watching Jake play Warfare Arena while pointing excitedly at the screen. Tyrric knew a lot of killers in his life, Koz wasnt one of them. I dont believe it, Tyrric told him. You know the suspect? Matheson asked him with more than a little disbelief in his voice. Hes standing right here. When and how did Antoni die exactly? Matheson took a few seconds to respond. About a minute ago, he overdosed on painkillers. Well there you go, not only would that have been impossible for the kid to do, but it sounds to me like an accident, Tyrric reasoned out matter-of-factly. Would you mind telling that to General Damphair? Hes about to scramble the security forces to take him into custody. I dont think-, Tyrric started to say before Matheson cut him off. Let me rephrase that, Matheson interrupted, Go explain that to General Damphair, thats an order. Well keep the network open for another half hour, I expect a report before then. Yes sir. Matheson ended the call and Tyrric turned to the two kids, I have something I need to do, sorry. Jake paused his game and looked up with a disappointed look on his face, I thought we were going to play that board game? This is kind of important, he tried to explain, I was just on the line with the chief general. Then after, Jake tried to insist. Fine, after. Tyrric hurried out of the bridge. After a while it occurred to him that it would probably be useful to know exactly where Koschei Detleff was for the next half hour. Ellida, do you think you could keep those two busy until I get back? Sure thing Captain, Ellida cheerfully replied, I wanted a chance to play some of Jakes games anyways. A half hour and some rather heated arguments later Tyrric returned to the bridge. Jake was in such a hurry to play he tossed his datapad down and spilled most of the pawns onto the floor. Well arent you eager, Tyrric commented, Itll take more than that to beat *me* though. --- I cant believe I lost to a child, Tyrric bemoaned into his glass. The bartender just gave him a look that said, Really? and moved down the bar to another patron. The computer was one thing, all she did was run combat simulations, but the kid? Tyrric wanted to think that the kid had been cheating, but unless he could see the future it was impossible to cheat at that game. It had been so long since Tyrric had lost a game he couldnt even remember what it was like. The game had been a fun distraction, but eventually he remembered the more pressing concern hanging over his head. *Half a million Fourst Destroyer-class battleships,* he lamented to himself. *A dozen would probably be enough if they were all as powerful as Ellida.* How long could humanity hope to hide? Tyrric downed the rest of his whiskey. It was strong stuff, he was already starting to feel it. A stunning blonde glided into the stool next to him. I believe you owe me a drink, Commander Tyrric. Ivana said by way of introduction. How did she know he was here? Oh yeah. Its not every day a beautiful lady like yourself saves my life from a giant alien megalomaniac. Ivana cocked an eyebrow at his comment. What? he demanded of her face. Does that line work on all the girls? she commented while signaling the barkeep. Huh? Im pretty sure youre the only woman whos ever saved my life, Tyrric trailed off, trying to make sense of what she meant. Barkeep. Ill have another martini, Ivana ordered as the bartender returned, Dirty. I thought you just said I owed you a drink? Tyrric asked. Ivana shrugged, Youll just have to get the next one. The bartender delivered Ivanas dirty martini and Tyrric took the opportunity to refill his own drink. Now that he had her alone, he wanted to clear up some details. How did you show up when you did? he asked. That ship is a maze if you dont know the layout. The chances of you showing up just in time to save me seems a little too unbelievable to me. Youre welcome, Commander, she replied with sarcasm. Not that I wasnt grateful, he added. Still, he let his last word hang between them. Ivana took her time setting down her glass before responding. I thought you would have figured that one out by now Commander Tyrric, she mused, stretching out her words. She seemed to enjoy not telling him what he wanted to know. And? Tyrric urged impatiently. Instead of replying, the ex-Tarkin employee only smiled and chuckled to herself in a private joke. Whats so funny? he demanded. You really didnt notice? I put a tracking device on you. Tyrric shot upright out of his stool. You what? he demanded, When? She looked around the bar self-consciously. The other patrons didnt appear to be overly interested in their conversation. Calm down. She gestured to his seat and only continued once hed sat back down. In the hall, as soon as I found you. I was planning to follow you but then you locked me in that closet, at this she puffed out her bottom lip in a pouty face. Im not going to defend myself, Tyrric defended himself. You were just a distraction. I needed to be at my best. Ivana arched her eyebrow again, So Im a distraction? Of course you are. Tyrric thought it was obvious that a civilian in a combat scenario always complicated things. Very well, Ivana replied, Your room or mine? Tyrric froze and replayed back the last few seconds of conversation in his mind. He quickly realized that theyd been having two very different conversations. Look, its tempting, he paused and looked her over. She was an attractive woman, there was no doubt. Ivana fluttered her eyes in confusion. I hope youre not about to make the mistake I *think* youre about to make. She trailed off. Well, we work together and- Ivana immediately stood up, a haughty look on her face. You know what? Never mind about that second drink. She turned to leave. *Shit.* Tyrric reached out and grabbed her hand to stop her. Wait. She turned around to face him. I guess we dont work together *that* much, he conceded. Ivana gave him a devious smile. --- Tyrric silently motioned with one hand to the men behind him. He jabbed and twirled one finger in a signal that told them to move up and hold the position at 10 oclock. They moved silently into position. The mechanical exoskeletons his men were equipped with were designed not to make a sound for exactly just such an occasion. The glacier ice that lined the halls was not designed with sound in mind so each mechanical footstep made a soft crunch. Ellida had redesigned the treads as a tradeoff of sound and grip. Tyrric liked to think that they had made the perfect compromise; but the crunch of each footstep made him change his mind just a bit. Ellida might have been right on that point. The men got into position and Tyrric moved up to the next intersection. He took a quick peek around the corner. Plasma fire struck him in the helmet, the Fourst had been waiting for him with energy weapons at the ready. He pulled his head back before a second blow could breach his armor. He tore the orange-hot helmet from his head and threw it around the corner. The Fourst atomized it with their energy weapons in seconds. This wasnt good; had the Fourst heard their footsteps, or had his team tripped the silent alarm? No, they were waiting behind barricades. It had to have been the silent alarm. The clock was really ticking now. *Three Fourst. Waiting behind barricades,* Tyrric reported on the sublingual channel, there was no point in maintaining radio silence if their presence was already known. They seem pretty trigger-happy. You going to be okay without a helmet Commander? Edwards responded on the same channel. *As long as* that *doesnt happen again,* he replied, gesturing towards the black patch of ash where his helmet had been a moment before. Ellida had already hacked the stations oxygen levels, so he was only in danger of catching a cold for now. Edwards held out a grenade, and Tyrric nodded an affirmative. Four more of the boys joined in and Tyrric counted down from three with his fingers. A few seconds later a dozen grenades bounced around the corner. His team was around the corner unloading clips into the barricades before the snow had even settled to the ground. There was a bright blue flash, then everything went black. Tyrric had a weightless feeling, floating in the darkness of oblivion. Slowly, a soft red glow began to suffuse his sight. It took a while for him to realize his eyes were closed, and when he opened them he saw the source of the light. It was a tree like none other, as large as the world and made entirely of light. He floated there in the void, for the breadth of a single heartbeat he was paralyzed with awe. The tree seemed to beckon to him. It beckoned for him to *return*. No! he screamed into the void. He knew he couldnt go back, not yet. Tyrric snapped his eyes open. After a moment he realized he was lying in a pink silk bed that definitely wasnt his own. For one thing, it was a king sized bed; yet he was alone in the tangle of blankets. There was a news station playing on the opposite wall that caught his attention. The current story was about a security breach on the Toolsquares server. They were urging anyone with a Toolsquares account to change any passwords of any accounts that used the same password as the one they used on their Toolsquares account. Of course, Tyrric only had one password for everything, he counted himself lucky he hadnt let that kid convince him to set up a Toolsquares account last night. That wouldve been *phenomenally* bad luck. The news anchor moved on to the next story, The hacktivist group known as MKX distributed fake government documents last night which they claimed was evidence of a secret alien war by the government, According to Johnson telling the public about the Fourst would only increase crime and terrorism while decreasing stock prices and productivity. Apparently Johnson hadnt calculated denial into his simulations. The truth was out there now but nobody was going to believe it. It was fairly unbelievable. Just then the sound of running water suddenly shut off. Tyrric hadnt realized it had been on until it stopped. He was trying to piece together just where he was when Ivana emerged from the bathroom with a towel wrapped around her. Oh. Ivana gave Tyrric a half-lidded glance that said, Youre still here? then proceeded to get dressed as though he wasnt. Dropping her towel only got his blood pumping. She nonchalantly started picking out clothes from a wardrobe the size of Tyrrics bathroom, which caused him to vaguely wonder what she had done to get such a nice room. Then he vaguely wondered if he could convince her to postpone getting dressed for a little while longer. He slid out of bed and sidled up behind her while she was comparing bras. What are you in such a hurry to get dressed for? Tyrric asked while breathing down her neck. I can feel you back there, Ivana mentioned with a hint of annoyance. Thats your fault for getting dressed in front of me. She set the bras down and turned to face him with a roll of her eyes. She glanced down, paused, then guided Tyrric onto the bed with one hand to his chest. You have five minutes. I have a lot of stuff to do today.

It was, at first glance, an extremely inviting world, with a broad expanse of ocean that covered nearly ninety-seven percent of its surface, and a surface temperature that bordered on balmy, but it was definitely not the kind of place you wanted to visit. Nearly twice the mass of Earth with an atmosphere four times as thick, the ocean planet was definitely better looking from a distance. These faults notwithstanding, it had proven an incredibly valuable source of atmosphere and water for the ancient hab-station, once theyd restored basic power, and it was self-evident why the Yarmyek had selected it as their preferred build site. Less evident was why theyd never gotten around to using it; by derelict standards, the place had been practically pristine when they had arrived, as though it had spent all those years waiting just for them. Jen and, to a lesser extent, Darragh had both found this somewhat creepy, and reminiscent of a horror movie, although even their most thorough investigations had yet to turn up any monsters. Delighted that something was going right for once, Chir had immediately claimed the station as his new base of operations, but Jen was unable to shake the sense of vague, cinematic peril, and had soon opted to return to her mission. Keffa had already finished docking the Devastator by the time Jen entered orbit, and was physically checking over the outer hull when Jen exited their newest acquisition, a light-blue freighter styled as the Broken Blue. Never thought Id see any of us flying a freighter of all things, Keffa remarked as Jen walked towards her. The exchange was as bloodless as you hoped? They were very compliant, Jen replied, turning back to consider the freighter from a distance. Once they realised I was a human, anyway. Jen had been looking forward to a life without piracy or high crimes, but the world was more complicated than that, and did not make things easy for those with no money. Unfortunately she had already learned that crime paid very well, and so it was only natural that the group returned to theft as a means of ship acquisition. It was not ideal, and yet it had allowed them to expand their fleet to six fully functioning starships in a matter of months. What about it then? Keffa asked, trusting Jen to know what she was talking about. About what? Jen asked, feigning ignorance. Keffa rolled her eyes. Agwar. You must have scanned it on your way back, yeah? Any change? Jen sighed. Only what we predicted. Space is still completely bonkers out that way, but the weirdness is receding and the whole system is slowly moving out of that bad patch. I think well see it clear on schedule. Pity, said Keffa. One of the reasons theyd adopted Sanctuary was the proximity to Agwar. Aside from the possibility that Adrian was alive in here, Jen still felt she needed to try and save the place. Darraghs back as well. Jen nodded. On time, thats good. Given ownership of a light, one-man scout, Darragh had been tasked with collecting data on the other Deathworlds in the area, and returning with all the information that could be gathered from orbit. Thus far hed uncovered eight Deathworlder civilisations capable of being detected from space, and had determined that only two of them were compatible with the galactic community. The others, intelligent though they might be, had far more in common with their VStraki engineer and were thus more likely to cause serious problems. Askit had remarked that maybe the Hierarchy had some kind of *point*, and Jen found herself unable to disagree; the galaxy would simply be a better place if some of those species never made it into space. No more psycho-pandas to haunt us? Keffa shook her head. He already talked to Chir, but I was listening in: more primitives, and still no sign of the fucking Hierarchy. Jen spat on the deck at the mention of their name, giving a less-than-subtle indicator of how she felt about the invisible galactic menace. She knew that hoping to find them was foolish, but after that mess on Agwar, and the news about San Diego, she was itching for another fight, and their continued absence left her angry and confused. That was the weirdest part; in her opinion they should be everywhere, shutting down Deathworlder civilisation with deadly force, but it seemed as though theyd almost entirely withdrawn from the Band. Whether or not that had anything to do with the San Diegan crater was yet to be determined, but Jen guessed theyd redeployed their forces to focus on Earth. So whats the next step? Keffa asked after a lengthy silence, breaking it only as the two of them entered the administrative hub at the end of the central promenade. They had been surprised to discover the station was built with a strong sense of natural aesthetics in mind, and the streets were filled with places clearly intended for gardens of some variety, rather than the patches of bone-dry dirt that currently filled them. One day, if they stuck around, the vision of a gardened hab-station might come to fruition, but until then it only increased the austerity of the place. Xayn happened to be entering the building at the same time, weighed down under a coil of power conduit, but stopped to answer the question as though it had been directed at him. I will run this conduit from the ships to a power junction to help boost the energy stores. Then we should be able to re-activate the fabricator. Keffa stared at him long enough that it made *Jen* feel uncomfortable on Xayns behalf, although it clearly didnt have the same effect on the Saurian, who gave her the VStraki rendition of a thumbs-up. Jen was fairly sure that Askit had taught him that move, and only because hed found it terribly amusing to watch other people suffer through. I was talking about the Deathworlds, Keffa informed Xayn once theyd reached peak-thumb. Jens mission was to map them out for human occupation, but it seems like theyre all either occupied or a total fucking mess. The VStraki cocked his head, an expression that indicated considered thought, and appeared to purr. They had eventually learned that this is what it looked like when he was having an idea he liked. Given time, the Hierarchy would destroy these Deathworlds. Why not take these creatures and press them into willing service against their would-be slaughterers? The Hierarchy would never expect it our victory would be glorious! Xayn burst out laughing with the kah kah kah sound that was about as full-bellied as he could manage. Keffa raised an eyebrow as she traded glances with Jen, and shrugged. Its got a certain poetry to it. Poetic, maybe, Jen conceded, but wed surely develop a certain fame if they heard about it back on Earth. Do you have any idea how many people would be jumping up and down about cultural contamination, or Western Imperialism if we started in on that? Christ just thinking about it does my head in. Keffa shrugged again. We can just tell em to go fuck themselves. What would Adrian do? Jen rolled her eyes. Doing whatever the fuck we feel like isnt a good way forward, Keffa. Agwar is still totally inaccessible to us, and Ive not a doubt in my mind where the blame for that can be placed. So were not assembling a hodge-podge, mixed-species team of questionable characters? asked Darragh, stepping in from the stairwell. Shame I was looking forward to calling myself Starlord. Xayn regarded him and nodded. It would fit. You were eavesdropping? Jen asked, before gesturing towards Xayn. And why does he know it fits? First of all, youre both being very mean, Darragh replied, looking pointedly at the two of them, and I got him some top shelf human entertainment on my last trip to a proper station. It was mostly mating videos, Xayn noted. I have learned that females receive many favours in exchange for such rights, along with many other useful things. Darragh reddened slightly at the looks he received from his fellow humans. Yes, well, they didnt have a table of contents, and I was too stupid to check it first. Anyway, I dont see how Im eavesdropping when youve all got the volume dialled up. I was just having a chat with the boss about how lonely it is around here. Jen frowned. It was hard to know whether Darragh was talking about the general sense of isolationthe hab-station was clearly intended for more than the six of themor Chirs emotional state after theyd returned time-cloned Layla back to where shed called home. It had been there that hed discovered the version he knew and cared about had never survived the return journey. He hadnt taken it well, and Layla had taken it even worse, and things had just settled into a simmering pot of emotional turmoil ever since. Yet another reason to keep going out and exploring. And? Keffa prompted. I assume youre going somewhere with this story? And he agreed that we should be looking at allowing settlers, Darragh finished. Weve got a lot of space, and a lot of work to do, but theres a lot of money to be had out here if you know how to get it, and opportunity to put the screws on the Hierarchy if were careful. And you happen to know how to make a lot of money? Keffa asked sceptically. The judgement was reasonable; it was painfully clear that Darragh had never made a lot of money. No, but I know somebody who does, Darragh replied. Yes, Xayn said, bobbing his head in agreement. Human males will often pay in exchange for mating rights. Keffa looked like she was about to hit the Saurian, and Jen felt much the same way. Darragh had the good sense to take a step back, and picked the right side. Xayn! he exclaimed. You cant say that sort of thing to women! Theyre not prostitutes! Somehow Darraghs defence actually made Jen even more annoyed. And were not going to be, either! she added sharply. Im fairly sure hes talking about the Corti. Yes, Darragh confirmed, looking relieved. I mean obviously hes a notorious criminal, but so is everyone else here. Hes also a notorious criminal who can make our station legitimate. Jen had trouble seeing that happening. And the Dominion will just forget about all our crimes? It seems unlikely. As does the chance that people will actually come to live here. That was my view as well, said Chir, emerging from behind Darragh and startling him in the process. But there is an opportunity here as well. Which is? Jen asked. Chir gestured to well, everything. Ark may be difficult to get to, and it may be remote, but we do have unfettered access to Deathworlds and a large number of other locations that do not officially exist. You named this place, I recall, after a mythological water-vessel tasked with preserving the existence of life on Earth, just as you want to preserve these Deathworlders against the Hierarchy. The six of us cant manage that alone, and Im not inclined to start abducting primitive specimens of whatever. We need to look at other options. I think Ive found some. They waited, allowing Chir his moment of dramatic pause. He eventually broke into a cunning grin, bringing to mind a black-furred fox, and continued. It may not be quite what youre proposingbringing primitive creatures into our group could only end in disasterbut it does fall in line with your intent. This station was built by the Yarmyek League in the days of their decline, far out of their claimed space. It is my beliefalthough it is merely an educated guessthat they had intended this place as a safeguard against their final collapse. They never had the opportunity to use it, but that doesnt mean we cant see out their purpose. There are no fewer than four species in late-stage decline in the galaxy, and it is my intention that we should save them, by force if necessary. You think the Hierarchy is behind that as well? Keffa asked, arching an eyebrow. Have we seen evidence of that? We know that they can control people through implants, said Chir, and these species lean heavily on them. I am tasking you, Keffa and Darragh, with getting us a breeding population of each. What about their implants? Keffa asked. If the Hierarchy gets wind of what were up to Askit will be joining you, he revealed. He has almost completed his anti-Hierarchy cyber-solution, so youll leave once hes got it working across the entire station. He can install a local copy on the ship while youre travelling. So ideally, they wont know a thing, Darragh concluded. Thats a good plan. Simple, and workable, and these colonists are unlikely to want to run off somewhere else when they realise whats actually been happening. Jen nodded along. And what about me? Ive got work to do with my surveys. Thats got to be done if Im to remain in the good books with Earth especially with what happened on Agwar. Chir shook his head. Youll need to delay that. Im aware that Xayn and I are an unstoppable force, but its a big station and we could use another set of hands in getting it ready. Therell be a need for more water, more food, and more raw materials. I think you can get most of that down on the planet, but you may need to go further afield. It would *all* be further afield. Jen had been down to the planet exactly once, and had decided against ever going back. A human could survive there, but they would be far from happy with the combination of heavy, humid air, blasting winds, and mountainous, crashing waves. Going elsewhere would be less convenient in the short term, but there was plenty of water-ice floating around if you knew where to look. Easy done, she replied. It was likely to be laborious, unforgiving work even with the help of technology, although those tools were the only thing that made it a one-person job in the first place. Even so, it seemed like it was more suitable for someone with Adrians build, and not a slip of an Irish girl, even if she did figure herself strong for her size. Yet another reason to wish he was still amongst them, rather than stuck in some kind of persistent spatial anomaly. The best she could hope for was that, instead of getting into his usual amount of troubleor being killed in an exploding shiphed been able to find a group of Agwarens and convince them he was some kind of deity. After her own turn at it, there was a circularity to the concept that seemed to fit nicely, and made the fact that theyd abandoned him seem a little less terrible. **++++** **++++** **THE DASTASJI, UPPER TROPOSPHERE OF UNNAMED TERRESTRIAL PLANET** **Kama** Shift change was always welcome, provided it was your shift that was ending. That was not the case for Kama and his team, whod spent the last day-cycle preparing for their deployment to the planet, so that the costly mistakes of others could be learned from. There was a reason that theyd established a ground camp and kept the Dastasji drifting amongst the clouds, and it had nothing to do with tactics; Kama had grown up in the jungled southlands of the continent, and life had been harsh, but thered never been anything like what hed seen in this place. With its aggressive vegetation, and psychotic giant fauna, the planet was nightmare enough, but the enemy had raised an army of bizarre creatures that were well adapted to the environment, and that didnt even cover the primitives whose tactics were sufficient to warrant wariness. Then there was the other thing, the *predator*, and that alone was reason to employ the nuclear option from orbit. Unfortunately, without the systematic annihilation of the whole planet, they could never be sure the problem was solved. Drones, along with boots on the ground, was the only solution likely to yield results. He looked around at his team of red-chips as they checked their equipment one last time before the drop. It was how they kept their focus on the job, and off the awful dread of what was to come. As the sole survivor of his previous expedition, Kama had been selected as guide for his next, under the direct command of Squad Leader Razen, but there was no distracting himself from the memories of his last journey to the planet. He was therefore the first to stand to attention when Razen stepped into the excursion chamber. Razen nodded to him before taking his place at the front of the room. We have been given the go-ahead, he announced. Drop is in [five minutes]. Everything is loaded into the pod? He received the affirmation from all twelve members of his expeditionary force, and indicated that this was as he expected. We are to receive our briefing on the surface. Get locked into your seats. He stepped aside to allow Kama and the others the room needed to file into the drop pod and take up a position on one of the troop stations. Kama took his seat and drew the belts into placemostly unnecessary unless the kinetics failedbefore connecting the weapons-feed to his visor. Sensing that the connection had been made, the visor automatically switched from augmented reality to full immersion, giving Kama the sensory input provided by his designated cannon. The weapons systems were, for the most part, fully-automatic, and the drop-pod was heavily gunned so that when it made its descent the enemy would suffer an unrelenting cannonade. With the typical VStraki mistrust of automated technology, each member of the crew could take over any number of the guns at any time. It wasnt something that Kama had ever needed to do, outside of training, so for the most part he treated the experience as a particularly vivid overview of the situation below. If not for this system, he would never have noticed the drop pod beginning to fall away from the Dastasji. In line with standard practice he tested taking control of his designated turret and returning it to automatic operation, after which he settled in for the rest of the drop. For a long while the clouds formed an unbroken floor of white below them, followed by a few moments of opaque grey, and then the familiar viridian landscape burst into view. The thick forest swept outwards in every direction, deceptively peaceful from above, while Thresholdthe name of their operational baselay directly below, surrounded by a circle of blackened terrain. It was the second such base; the original had been a hasty construction intended for fact-finding missions, and had been utterly overwhelmed by the rapidly growing vegetation. Threshold was a permanent structure, an elevated, heavily fortified construction that overlooked the burned wasteland. Expendable drones, armed with burner-beams, roamed the designated area, ensuring that nothingflora, fauna, or enemy combatantcould cross. Thus far it had been greatly successful, but it remained the only success for the operation. The rapid drop slowed only at the last moment as kinetics fired off, raising a whirl of dust from the open ground inside the compound. The drop-pod for the previous team shot upwards at the exact same moment, thereby completing the exchange. We are down, Razen reported. It wasnt strictly necessarythe computers could communicate without issuebut it was an extra precaution against alien interference with the computer systems. The visor feed cut out, and Kama unplugged along with everyone else, proceeding in single-file out of the drop-pod and heading towards the briefing room; thered be no rest for them until theyd finished their first day mission. Razen was last into the room, and entered in the company of Ground Commander Ekkel, who looked them over appraisingly as he took up position at the lectern. Welcome to Strife, Ekkel began, as he had when hed greeted Kamas first team; someone had come up with the name on the first deployment, and it had stuck. For some of you this will be your first deployment. For othershe looked at Kamait will be a return to a nightmare. You will all have heard stories they do not do justice to the reality. It is vitally important that you all remain on high alert when outside these walls, and keep your atmo-filters engagedthe whole planet has been infected by some sort of extreme bio-weapon, and everything you meet will be as aggressive as it is big and hungry. He turned to Razen, who proceeded with the briefing from there. We have been tasked with a sweep of Sector Six. We know the area is inhabited by two tribes of primitive sapients, but they have also been infected, and are to be exterminated on sight. There are several major crash-sites in sector six, none of which have yet been mapped, let alone cleared. Our objective is to clear the nearest crash site at Point Aleph. Other known hostiles in the area include the forces of the Artificial Intelligence, Ekkel continued, switching the vid-screen to display multiple images of a large, bug-like creature that reminded Kama strongly of the Igraens. You are the first force to know of this, as Medician Takkid has only just given us the confirmation, but there is a clear genetic link to the Igraens. We believe this may indicate a relationship between our quarry and the Igraen Alliance, so be careful. They are heavily armed, and are modified with advanced weaponry of unknown design, Razen resumed. Autopsies back up theories formed from their observed behaviour: they function as though they are a hive mind. Kama raised his hand, and waited for Razen to acknowledge him before speaking. Can that be used against them? If they are in communication, it must be possible to disrupt that communication. Razen and Ekkel traded a glance. That is our hope, Razen confirmed. We are still waiting on the engineers to produce a working dampener. The image switched to another, this time an autopsy of some kind of beast, with a particular focus on the skull. Where there should have been a brain, there was something else, and the sense of revulsion ran through all present. These are also derived from the Igraen gene-pool, Razen continued with undisguised disgust. A parasite. It consumes the brain to control the body. The picture switched once more, this time to the autopsy of a VStraki trooper. Kama recognised the face of Rekt, whod gone missing on the first day of his previous expedition. Once again there was no brain, only the same hideous creature. Razen waited for the murmurings to settle before he continued. We are *not* immune to their predations. This trooper was identified as Rekt, son of Vadin, and the parasite was able to trick the guards into believing it was still our trooper. Thankfully our genetic scanners made up for their error, or the infiltration would have gone unnoticed. All of us undertake daily blood-scans while on-base, as well as when we check-in. No exceptions, Ekkel added, although Kama couldnt imagine anybody refusing after what theyd just seen. Making it explicit, however, meant that he had just given himself the authority to immediately execute anyone who disobeyed. Some of you will have heard about another creature, Razen continued. Let me assure you that you have enough to worry about without giving credence to rumours. There is no reason to suspect that there is any such thing as a predator in the area. Remember that we VStraki are the strongest species to evolve on a high-threat world, and that we alone have access to advanced tactical equipment. Our enemy is a rampaging eco-system and the desperate remains of an Artificial Intelligence, and provided we remain vigilant we have nothing to fear. Ekkel nodded, switching the vid-screen off. Assemble in the yard. Except you, Trooper Kama. You remain with us for a moment longer. Kama hissed out a sigh as he watched his fellow expeditionary troops exit the briefing room, many of them casting suspicious glances back at him as they left. When he turned back he found Razen and Ekkel far closer, and Razen gripped him by the shoulder with a vice-like grip. I am aware of your encounter on your last visit, Ekkel said. You met it the predator creature. I did, Kama confirmed, unsure what this was about. Hed been given a full debriefing upon his return, and hadnt held anything back. Briefly. Ekkel looked down at his data-pad. You said it threw a piece of metal at you, then told you the next one would be coming a lot faster? Ah, yes, Kama said, clearing his throat. The retelling of the encounter had seemed ridiculous, especially when the creature hadnt even looked physically formidable, but the fact was that it had also just killed two of his fellow red-chips with a *sharp rock*, and Kama had dropped his gun. I took it as a request to leave. It spoke in VStraki? Razen asked for verification. Without the use of a communicator? Yes, said Kama, but with mushy pronunciation. It didnt give you its name? Ekkel pressed. Kama shook his head. We did not converse further. May I know what this is about? Razen looked to Ekkel, who briefly hesitated, then nodded his approval. Razen paused a moment, as though trying to find the words. The most recent Expeditionary force eliminated a group of primitives. The primitives had a universal translator with them, and were able to talk to them. Kama cocked his head to the side; that was advanced technology, far beyond what a backwater world was capable of producing, and there was no good reason that it should have recognised VStraki. Was there an explanation? They claimed it was a trade-good from a strange, white-skinned creature, Ekkel told him. The description matched yours, but they were able to give a name: Adrian Saunders. Kama shook his head in ignorance; the name meant nothing to him. The Artificial Intelligence mentioned the name to our illustrious Shiplord, Ekkel explained. It implied that our escape from the anomaly was somehow the intention of that individual, although we had no further knowledge at that time. Currently we believe it is an alien of immense power, responsible for freeing us and then causing the enduring spatial disruption that traps us here, though we do not know the nature of its association with the Artificial Intelligence. A feeling of dread crept over Kama, and not merely because the explanation suggested hed escaped some kind of insane, god-level entity. The mere fact that it was being explained to him did not bode well. Why tell me all this? Because in the event that we encounter him, *you* are going to be in command, Razen replied. It will be your task to try and convince him to help us slay the Artificial Intelligence. We think it might feel kindly towards the natives, so perhaps you can arrange an understanding that they will be safest if our work is completed quickly. I thought you just said the predator was not in Sector Six? Kama noted, glancing between his two superiors. That was a lie, Ekkel replied flatly. Morale would be destroyed if they expected the predator. Ignorance is better. Previously, Kama would not have agreed to that. He would have protested, stating that it was always better for troopers to know what they were up against, so that they could pick their tactics ahead of time. This time, however, he understood the point: that in this world full of nightmares, the most terrifying thing knew who and what they were. Conversely, the most they knew about it was its name; somehow that didnt seem like a fair match. **++++** **++++** **The Shelter, Sector Six, Agwar Crash Zone** **LAPHOR METMIN** It was easy to hear the Deathworlder return along the corridors; his gait was readily recognisable, and he moved through the dark ruins with an understanding of where he was going, so Laphor was ready with lantern and decontaminant when he arrived in the room set aside for that purpose. Like the rest of her mercenaries, shed retained her vacuum suitalbeit with several patches that made it unsuitable for actual hard vacuumto protect her against micro-organisms whenever they needed to interact with the outside world, or with the one of their number actually capable of both going out into it and coming back. The crashed Hunter cruiser, burned and broken, provided substantial protection for everyday purposes, and Adrian had even gotten some of the lights and doors working on a separate circuit, thereby creating the Shelter, but they still needed food, water, and a way off this shitty, void-damned planet. Youre later than you said, was Laphors greeting as the human stepped into the room. Thought you might be dead. He grinned at her like a wild thing, and she wondered if perhaps this planets madness was rubbing off on him. Rather than a retort, he pulled out a bag weighed down with vegetable matterenough for eight local days amongst the mercenariesand dropped it on the floor between them. Then he stripped down, stood there, and presented himself for decontamination. Laphor acted without hesitation, activating the gas device that scrubbed everything it touched of dangerous bacteria. It wasnt supposed to be used on living beings, but Adrian hadnt known that when hed used it the first time, and although it turned his exposed skin pink it apparently only made him tingle. That may have had more to do with the deadening of his nerves than actual Deathworlder resilience, but either way it didnt seem capable of doing him lasting harm, and it needed to be done if the rest of them wanted to keep on living. The mist cleared quickly, after which the Human Disaster re-clothed himself in the tattered remnants of his hardened vacuum suit and scratched at his hairy neck. I tell you what, I need a fucking shave and then some. Ive never understood that about you, Laphor replied. Why remove hair thats naturally there? He shrugged. One of lifes great mysteries, I guess. Grabbing up the food supplies, he followed her into the interior of the Shelter where hungry mercenaries sat waiting. They eyed Adrian briefly, but their eyes were destined for the hefty bundle he was carrying. Finally, grumbled Clor. We thought you might be dead. Youd be surprised how often I get that, Adrian replied, putting the pile in between them all and grinning as they snatched up everything they could stuff in their mouths. Rarely turns out well for those who say it. Clor paused mid-bite, taking his meaning. Sorry just, it gets to you, being cooped up in here. Were thankful. Why *are* you late? Laphor asked. Run into more trouble with the natives, or was it more Hunters? I was keeping an eye on some VStraki jackboots, he replied grimly. They hit an Agwaren village south-west of here, and executed them all. Theyre savages, Laphor reminded him. Not like the ones youve met previously. Theyre sick, Adrian corrected. They didnt used to be like this, and theyre not monsters. When I met Xayn I had the feeling that maybe the great VStraki empire might not be the friendliest lot, but this has confirmed that in spades. Laphor knew that, for whatever strange reason, the Deathworlder took extreme exception to people killing other people based on species, especially to the point of wiping out groups of them. In the wider galaxy, that was often a factor of war, but Adrian had such *specific* words for itgenocide and xenocidethat Laphor wondered if maybe humanity had dealt with the matters in its past. Either way it pissed him off, and it was a good thing that he only stayed with them for brief intervals between supply runs and reconnaissance. Im surprised you didnt try and kill them all, Laphor replied simply. Armed with primitive weapons in addition to his fusion blades, Adrian was an extremely formidable force, but she hadnt been sure how hed fare against a properly armed group of Deathworlders. The answer had proven to be extremely effectively, and thered been no more VStraki groups trekking through their area for a while. He grimaced. Needed to get back to you. Thank you for that, she replied, genuinely grateful; she wasnt ignorant that theyd be long dead without his help. Are you going out again to hunt them down? No, he said, surprising her. Itd be rough-going to catch up with them, and their base is a fucking fortress like you wouldnt believe. Youre still going out though? she inferred; the better part of an orbital cycle had taught her to spot his nuances, and that understanding had made things a lot easier. He nodded as shed known he would. Theres probably some survivors even if theyre only a few hunters who were out when the rest of the tribe was getting murdered. Theyll want to know what happened, and who to blame. They wont attack you again? Laphor asked. Shed not seen one of these creatures personally, but Adrians descriptions had her picturing a massive, lumbering beast twice as large as him in every way. Theyd taken him for a monster at first sight, and had tried to kill himby his own admission, they were considerably stronger than himbut what they had in muscle theyd lacked in speed, agility, and tenacity. Adrian had come back bruised and bloody, but somehow alive, and until today the natives had decided against further attacks. They might think it was you! He shook his head. Its pretty fucking clear whose work it is, and theyre not dumb enough to miss those clues. Still Laphor began. Still, he continued, patting the hilt of his fusion sword, Ill be ready if they try anything stupid. Laphor recognised the futility of further argument, and that would have to be good enough. She took up one of the leaves, a thick and succulent type that grew like plates jutting from the trunks of larger trees. Sweet, nutritious, and full of water, they made an excellent snack, and Adrian had even assembled a contraption intended to transform the natural sugars into cleaning product. What he used it for she was uncertain, but when asked how well it worked hed replied fucking great, and that had been the end of it. With her own hunger satisfied, she turned to the terminal theyd assembled from parts found around the crashed cruiser, and scavenged by Adrian from other vessels nearby. It ran on a stripped-down computer core, powered by the most basic of generators, and the vid-screen was suspended by loops of power conduit. Laphor suspected that they couldnt have done better if theyd *purposefully* built it to resemble how she felt about her life. So, she said, bringing up the map of the area, give us an idea of what you saw. Salvaged from the cruisers records, the map was wildly out of date, showing the forest and field that had existed just prior to the crash. Theyd marked in the locations of crashed ships, where the native tribes were settled, and where Adrian had encountered VStraki and Hunter alike. To nobodys surprise he pointed at the southern settlement, tapping the screen so that it swung gently back and forth until he stopped it. There, he said, then moved his finger further south. The VStraki moved off directly towards their base after finishing the job. What did they have with them? Laphor asked. Standard drones and equipment? Theyd already established that the creatures were well-resourced, possessing access to surveillance and hunter-seeker drones in addition to their own lightweight outfits. Adrian had killed a pair of them, proving that the outfits were not intended to protect against a heavy rock being slammed into the skull, but had forgone claiming any of it. He had reasoned that they might be able to track ita concern that Laphor had not even considered until hed mentioned itand had considered secrecy a better defence than a handful of weapons. That argument, combined with how easily hed overpowered the two VStraki soldiers, led her to agree. You should rest before you leave, she suggested. Or at least have something to eat. He shook his head at the pile of food. Thats for you I ate before I got here. Rest, though He looked towards the corridor that led into the area theyd claimed for residence, seemed to suck on his teeth, and nodded. Hed looked half-dead ever since theyd arrived, but somehow hed kept on goingpart of that Deathworlder tenacity, no doubtbut there were limits for even the Human Disaster, and the signs were all there. Yeah thatd be for the best. Itll be night soon anyway. Hed never explained that in full, but it was enough to know that he didnt like his chances at night any more than the rest of them did. She imagined that even when he was away for days at a time, he would always find a place to hide in until sunrise. Hide only, though, because it seemed like he saved sleeping for the safety of the shelter. Watching him slouch off towards his sleeping chamber, Laphor wondered how much longer they could all go on this way. Not long, she thought; one way or another it would all inevitably come to an end. **++++** **++++** "
17,cyber crime,HFY,[OC] Tribunal Regarding Terran Confederacy War Crimes,603,5hp5lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5hp5lg/oc_tribunal_regarding_terran_confederacy_war/,2016-12-11 19:13:24,"The room Admiral Lauren Smith stood in was not a small one by any means. Considering the sheer number of delegates it had to hold each day, that was hardly surprising. She stared out from her seat at the array of species seated in the Galactic Senate, her eyes drifting down from the just inducted and considerably slimy Tectin at the far fringes, to the scintillating feathered Keewt, and finally resting on the delegates sitting closest to the central platform she was seated on. That row was comprised of the Galactic High Tribunal, a collection of five species that acted as supreme judges regarding inter-species issues. There were the Hmgul, who had been Humanities First Contact and sponsor into the UGCS. Who knew apes and four armed crocodile/jackal hybrids would get along so well? The Krrlth was next in line, carefully preening one of its six wings with a sharp beak. The Tilths representative looked rather disturbed to be next in lineconsidering the problems his species, things that looked like a ferret with too many eyes in weird places, had with avian predators on their homeworld, that was hardly surprising. Lauren was just impressed he hadnt tried to cocoon himself yet, which put him ahead of the Glull representative, whod retracted almost fully into its chitin save for one of its heads. The last two had her pursing her lips. The Frrliss werent a problemthey got along rather well with humans, though both hoped neither species ever found out exactly why. When aliens resemble your favorite pets it can getawkward. No. It was what she was discussing, and with who. She tapped the translator masquerading as an earring, deciding to listen in for a bit. cannot continue this line of conversation if you insist on these vague threats. [Deific expletive], you are accusing a Member Species of serious war crimes, and A tentacled cross between a gator and a chipmunk interrupted her. And my leaders simply want it known that if justice is not served, it will weaken the ties between our people. Negotiations regarding colony rights are strained as it is. Surely you dont wish to exacerbate such Welp, that was more than enough. She was tired of this idiocy. Besides, her communicator had just beeped in a particular pattern. Admiral Lauren stood, and the assembled aliens quieted. Not out of respect though. Im sure some of you are wondering why you can only hear me now. One of our cyber specialists decided my little speech here was more important than your squabbles. So shut up, sit down, and listen. She snapped her fingers, and a holofield appeared behind her, a rotating world on it. She continued. We were assembled today to discuss several matters, but those concerning me and my people are what we are accused of. We have been accused of several crimes under galactic law, including Violation of the Tallvril Trade Accords, Breaking Galactic Warfare Doctrine, and assorted general war crimes. She glanced at a datapad on the desk and snorted. The first two counts I honestly dismiss out of hand. We werent even using ballistic weaponry when the Tallvril Accords were written for one, and the charge youve labeled us with is ludicrous. We stopped trade with the Morag, during wartimes, and you accuse us of Using Deadly Conflict To Enrich Private Interests? We havent even stopped trade with the Taugal, and theyre the Morags closest allies. Our lawyers are actually enjoying this one. You cannot honestly say refusing to trade with someone we are at war with fits these criteria. She looked up with a raised eyebrow. And really, you have a galaxy wide doctrine of warfare you expect all species to adhere to? That is without a doubt the stupidest thing Ive heard in the past cycle. She shook her head and continued in a more formal tone. I dismiss our breaking with Galactic Warfare Doctrine for two reasons. One, because we never knowingly signed it. It was hidden as a rider within the ninety seventh trade agreement that was pushed as a requirement of our joining the greater United Galactic Civilizations, and we likely would have rewritten it entirely had we spotted it. Further, the rider was hidden after the fact, since we went over all of those with a fine toothed comb and it was not there when we sighed it. The second? Its just laughable. Honestly, some of our best military advisors almost hurt themselves laughing at it. Parts of it are admirable, certainlywe would never knowingly target a civilian outpost or condone war-slavery of any kind. But all of the war crimes you list are our use of stealth, of hit and run guerilla tactics, and of our use of ship disabling technology. She looked up with an almost pained expression. Gentlemen, women, and neuters, the Terran Confederacy is outgunned three to one by the Morag. They have better tech, bigger ships, and, frankly, would steamroll us if we kept to your doctrine. She raised an eyebrow. Honestly, it seems like the only reason the Morag have as many military victories as they do is this strange notion you all have that warfare must be honorable, stand up slugging matches between two armies. She glanced at the data pad and something happened to harden the lines of her face. Oh. The last war crime. Extensive Civilian Casualties. I do notice that only the Terran Confederacy has been charged with this. The loss of so many innocents in this war is truly saddening. Twenty-Three thousand Morag civilians. She glanced back at the holo screen for a moment. This was New Avalon. It was a garden world, to us at least. Total population, three point oh two billion. Total civilian population, three point oh one billion. It was not a military outpost. The image behind her changed. She stared out over the amassed crowd of aliens with cold eyes as several ships edged into view before the view went black. What you just saw were Morag Battlecruisers. Four of them. Her voice was calm, controlled, and almost robotic in its lack of emotion. They glassed the planet. It took them two weeks. The view snapped back on, this time on the surface. A small city. Something flashed in the skythe more savvy of those watching knew it to be a kinetic harpoonand there was a visible shockwave. Half of the city was obliterated instantly, and whatever was watching the city tumbled from the air into the remains. The image flickered, showing people streaming from their homes as a pillar of fire lanced from the sky, searing everything in its path into charred nothing. Dust and ash kicked up obscured the camera until it was consumed. The image flickered again, showing a room full of injured humans of all ages. A wave of silver crept up to cover the window before the wall dissolved, allowing a flood of metallic grey in that slowly liquefied everything, before it froze into a solid mass of metal. The images continued. More cities destroyed, farming communities burned, individuals choking on ash and dust. Admiral Lauren leaned against the desk, glaring at the assembled judge and jury with eyes of burning steel. The Morag burned one of our civilian garden worlds. And they didnt even have the decency to do it quickly. She said in that same level voice. The Terran Military has killed fewer Morag civilians during the entire war than the Morag did in this one attack. And we have dutifully reported every. Single. One. As outlined in your doctrine. As outlined by basic common transparency. And I will remind you that over two thirds of those were from a single colony drop that is still under investigation. She jabbed a finger back at the screen. And yet I hear nothing of the Morags crimes. This is one of three. Three garden worlds they have burned, and five they have targeted. They make claims of faulty information regarding military installations, but a five minutes scan wouldve revealed what these worlds are. She slapped a hand against the table and glared pointedly at the Morag sitting to the left of the Tribunal. The Morag are one of the most advanced races in the senate, with the single largest empire, and they get away with this. She said flatly. You accuse the Terran Military of war crimes for what? Hit and run tactics, guerilla ambushes, cyber warfare against enemy ships? She smiled, and let out a noise that the translators flagged as humorous outburst, but most present found very threatening. You accuse us of war crimes for using tactics that let us win against an enemy with better tech, bigger ships, and a bigger army. Honesty, I think you lot are just mad were showing you up by kicking their ass. She stood upright again. We do not enter a plea for any of the charges against us. The first is ludicrously simple to ascertain, the second should not be legally binding in any case, and the last is, frankly, just proof that this council is either deeply corrupt or simply terrified of the Morags military might. She paused and bared her teeth in a feral grin. And judging by the Morag delegates expression, if I can read her antennae correctly, she knows that the war is over anyway. She turned and snapped her fingers again. The holofield flickered and showed a scene of surprisingly bloodless carnage. A palace of some kind had a wall blown in, with a line of Morag cowering under the guns of two dozen Terran Marines. Only one didnt have a gun pressed to their head, and it stared directly into the communicator. This is the Morag Empire High Council. We wish to begin negotiations for peace with the Terran Confederacy. Immediately. "
18,cyber crime,HFY,Serial - Part 4 (OC),17,507ury,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/507ury/serial_part_4_oc/,2016-08-30 08:52:17,"Serial (Part 4  The Lesson) The sky shuttle slid from the ground soundlessly as Vigari maneuvered it into a clear lane and punched in the course for the home of the victim. Or rather, he corrected, victims. He had run the second heads face through the Live Minds identification algorithms and gotten a name. Her name had been Girol, the males name had been Jal, a mated paid living in the Cozo block. Setting the shuttle into auto-pilot he removed his tablet and brought up the images he had taken from the scene, the last one displaying the grotesque stitch job that had forever bound the two Theolisians together. The image was enough to make Vigari shudder. Inter-species homicide wasnt as rare as the Consortium would have its populace believe. Vigari had seen it before, worked with it, been up to his elbows in it. But there was something off about this one. Usually when one got up to kill another it was all fire and blood. A clear line of reason from cause to effect, even if the cause was simply that a Renjaw happened to not like the look of a Norviegis face and tore them to pieces. This, however, spoke of intent and a black, seething malice. Why stitch them together like this? he asked, glancing sidelong at Jackson. The human Inquisitor was busy at work on his own tablet, familiarizing himself with the Live Mind interfaces. When he didnt immediately respond Vigari frowned, Is it a human custom? At that Jackson did perk up although he didnt lift his eyes from the tablet, If, he said, If the killer is human. And no, not really. Jackson tapped something then grinned as his screen flooded with the analytic data the Live Mind had assembled of the murder scene. For half a moment Vigari was tempted to slap the tablet away from Jackson. How could it not be a human? Even without the *toe-prints*, if such a thing even existed, the indentations in the dirt had been compared to those left by every member species and only returned a single match. Then there was also the message to consider. Lawrence was right, the human tongue was available to every member of the Consortium but why would anyone go to the trouble of leaving a message on their murder victim which was in a language that was exceedingly obscure as far as the galactic community went. The only viable motive would be to frame a human but then for what purpose? Humanity was small, a refugee species that had just barely escaped total annihilation. They had no valuable lands, no great wealth and hadnt done much in their two years on Keleshia but breed and build. But, Vigari thought, it was likely best not to press the issue. Jackson was just defending his own. He had spent most of his life acting as shepherd to a flock that had now been unleashed into an unfamiliar forest. He was scared, even if he wouldnt show it behind that smart ass grin. Jackson would come around, Vigari knew, he was smarter than he looked. Alright, Vigari began again, So *if* a human did this, why? Jackson looked up from the data pad, Are you asking me why humans murder? Well shit, not sure where to begin. The Em were, by nature, not an aggressive species. Aggression could be taught, as it had been so for Vigari, but they took their sustenance from water and light. Such was not the case for humanity. Vigari was passingly familiar with humanitys history. It had been stored on the refugee ship that had brought them through the endless dark to Keleshia and since translated and uploaded into Consortium data banks. Humanity, it seemed to Vigari, had a long history of murder for a great number of reasons. For duty, for country, even for love but those were wars. This was something different. No, he said, tapping his finger onto his tablet from which Jals dead eyes and morbid grin leered, Why kill like this? Why stage them? Jackson let out a long sigh and set his data pad down. He stared out the front window for a long moment, watching the dark fields bleed into a glimmering urban sprawl on the ground below. I think there are three basic types of killers, he finally said. The first commit crimes of passion. Tempers get too hot, mistakes are made and someone ends up dead. These ones are easy. Hell half the time the killer surrenders moment you get to talking to them, so twisted up by what theyve done or just too crazy to cover their tracks. Second, kills out of necessity. The killer needs something from the victim or needs to silence them. The murders clinical, detached, just part of a larger goal. These ones are harder to solve because the killer is thinking, planning, trying to work against us. The third... he trailed off, looking between his data pad and the world outside. The third? Vigari pressed. Jackson sighed and gave Vigari a halfhearted shrug, The third is rare. Ive never seen it and neither did my dad. The third kind is a serial killer. They might kill because of passion or because of necessity but those are just justifications to enable something broken. Some come from bad backgrounds, sure, but not as many as you would think. Some are like normal people, going about their lives until something inside them twists the wrong way and they carve up a teenager with a steak knife. They kill because they want to, need to. Like its the only way they can feel a connection, ya know? Most are smart too, which makes finding them next to impossible until they kill long enough to establish a pattern or make a mistake. See, to this third kind its more than murder, its art. A shadow passed over Jacksons face and it felt to Vigari as if a chill had entered the cabin. He shivered, his sinuous flesh rippling constricting nervously. And these third killers Is that what did this? Despite himself Vigari found he dreaded Jacksons answer. It was clearly a myth, his rational brain demanded. Some human boogie-man created to scare their children. What species could possibly survive long enough to reach the stars with so many horrors lurking in their subconscious? He wanted the human to laugh, to be leading Vigari on but instead Jackson just shrugged and held up two fingers. Two murders. One crime scene. Serial killers are defined by repeated acts. So I figure, get a few more bodies and we will talk. **************************************************** The home of the victims was built in traditional Theolisian style. Located on the western edge of the Caza block it appeared to be made of a black stone, smooth as glass and arranged in three inter-connected black, thirty-five foot spires. As a rule Theolisians built up rather than out and Vigari couldnt help but feel dwarfed as they passed through the entry portal and into the cavernous foyer of the central spire. The Keleshi peace keepers peered in behind them, chattering to each other too low for Vigari to hear. Likely speaking they were talking crap about the Inquisitors, or rather, Inquisitor. Jackson, while he may have the badge, had yet to receive his official indoctrination and hence didnt wear the red coat. On most Consortium worlds the coat meant a hell of a lot more than the badge. Vigari could only imagine the complaint letters that would be streaming into his tablet by dawn from do good peace keepers who thought he was bringing a civilian to a crime scene even they werent allowed to touch. Vigari tapped his tablet and brought up the schematics of the home. Three towers, two floors per tower. We should split up, he concluded, signaling towards the steep black rock staircase which curved around the bowl shape of the room. You check upstairs, Ill check down here. Make sure you record everything on your tablet and upload it to the Live Mind. As if to demonstrate Vigari tapped a small button on the side of his own tablet to produce a thin black stick, its end capped with a glossy eyed lens. He then tapped the stick to his temple and felt it adhere. On his screen a live feed from the camera displayed. Jackson groaned, Yes, mother, he said, removing and attaching his own camera. You sure you dont want the upstairs? Vigari eyed the stairs, each as tall as his chest, and shook his head. The last thing he wanted was to give Jackson the delightful sight of him struggling to maneuver up the steep Theolisian staircase on his stunted legs. You go ahead. Have fun. Be home by sun up, The human went, vaulting up the large steps with alarming alacrity. Now alone in the foyer Vigari let out a long breath. It was hard not showing how unnerving this all was. If the murder scene hadnt been enough the fact that it had scared high command enough into instating Jackson had spun this night into the long and dreadful territory. That was by no fault of Jacksons of course. The kid, a man by human standards, had good instincts. Vigari had wanted him to be an Inquisitor the moment they met but there was something wrong here. Here he was, sickened and Jackson seemed almost buoyant, happy even. Was this the natural human response to carnage? Vigari shook the feeling off. There would be time for that later. Once he had had a chance to process the evenings events. Likely speaking Jackson was just happy to be in the field, nothing more. The first room seemed to be combination kitchen and dining area although the bulk of the Theolisians diet was raw vegetation, which grew in abundance from wall mounted hydroponic gardens. He spent a time sweeping every corner with the Live Minds black eye before moving along. The next chamber was bare tile save for a circular inset in the floor which appeared to be filled with a dark black mud although Vigari could only guess at its use. The area surrounding the pit was scuffed by mud streaks left from several pairs of feet, a few which looked a bit human in Vigaris opinion. He documented everything, moving with practiced precision from mark to mark. He was just about to move along to the final chamber when a heavy hand clasped down on his shoulder. Vigari reacted on instinct, twisting his body and tucking down into a roll. He rose as he drew out the black metal Hound, his finger coiled around the trigger as it thrummed to life. Jackson held his hands up, eyes wide with an increasingly nervous smile frozen on his face. Whoa, he said, You can really move. Dont shoot man, Im unarmed. Vigari took a deep breath, then another before slowly lowering the Hound and tucking it back into the holster in the small of his back. You snuck up on me, he said. No I walked up behind you. You alright? he asked. Fine, Vigari lied, Did you find anything? The human hitched a thumb up over his shoulder, Found the rest of Mrs. Dinosaur, if you wanna see. **************************************************** The corpse had been discarded where she died, atop the bed of living ferns that her and her husband had slept in. Her corpse was intact save for the missing head and a single stab wound in her lower abdomen. She died quick, Vigari supplied, circling the corpse to ensure full coverage for the Live Minds eye. Puncture mark lines up with the tertiary brain stem. She would have entered a coma and suffocated almost immediately. Jackson had knelt beside the dead Theolisian. Donning a pair of gloves he reached forward and pried open the wound, ignoring Vigaris small cry of protest. Means she wasn't the primary target. Wound is deep, he said, Clean too. Live Mind match the wound to a weapon? Ignoring the black disgust that was welling up inside his chest Vigari pulled out his tablet and opened the Live Mind interface as his screen began to populate with its analysis of the late Mrs. Dinosaur. Live Mind states the weapon was something metal and thin. Not matching anything in its data-banks so likely something improvised. Maybe a pipe? There are rust flakes in the wound, Jackson reported, his own feed of the wounds interior updating the Live Minds analysis before he could even say the words. Pipe could be on the money but he touched the dead Theolisians skin. How the hell did the killer get through this? Through what? Vigari asked. The skin, Jackson turned to face him, Her hide is at least half an inch thick and tough. No human could have planted it that deep on one stroke. The wound is one clean stab so he couldnt have spent time working it in there and even if he had why didnt the husband wake up and save her? Vigari furrowed his brow, again glancing at the screen, It may have been launched? he suggested, Maybe compressed air? Then why the rust? Jackson said, That doesnt equate. What gun is shooting rusty poles? Vigari watched as the Live Mind began to run diagnostics on the homes internal computer, searching for any missing piping. Then maybe they were on some kind of strength enhancer. Also, he said, turning the tablet to face Lawrence with a perhaps slightly smug grin, analysis is done of the mud room downstairs. Human footprints of the same size and weight distribution as those found at the first murder scene. Human had to be the killer. Jackson rose, shaking his head, No, no that doesnt make sense. How the hell could he have done it. And for that matter, where is the murder weapon? There is no blood spray. Had he pulled it out she would have bled everywhere but look, he gestured to the room around him, Nothing. Maybe its wrong, he said, gesturing to the tablet in Vigaris hand. Its not wrong, Vigari said, a scowl mounting to replace his grin. The killer likely cleaned the scene. We should wait for the analysis to be completed. Jackson, maybe you had best begin to accept that this was one of your people. Why? Jackson asked, Because the cyber nanny says so? Vigari look at the evidence. Vigari scowled. It was one thing to have good instincts and an entirely different matter to assume that one knew better than the combined intellect of five hundred thousand sentient minds. Vigari held the tablet up, like a talisman, The Live Minds evidence is concrete and absolute. Maybe the perpetrator was on some kind of drug to enhance his physical capabilities and if so we will find out. But we will get nowhere if you insist on contradicting the Live Mind every chance you get. It is the backbone of our work and the heart of our order. That is, if you still plan on joining our order. Because if so you would do well to trust our tools a little more, dont you think? Vigari was surprised to hear how much venom had crept into his voice. Long night, he reasoned as he tried to temper himself, Jackson. I know you have been out of it for a while. Rust is inevitable. But the order needs you at your best. This is the first inter-species crime involving humanity since your induction into the Consortium and your people will need to see you at the head of this. There is no need to show off. We will catch whoever did this and we will do it with the tools that have been given to us, not wild speculation. Clear? For half a heartbeat Vigari was sure Jackson would argue but he didnt. Instead he stared sidelong at the second corpse of the evening, hands tucked into his pockets with a heavy sigh. Yeah, sure, he said, But I still say this isnt making sense. Vigari strode forward and clasped Jackson on the small of the back, Its been a long night for you. Why dont we let the Keleshi have the scene. The Live Mind will be processing all of this for a few hours anyways and come morning we can look at this with fresh eyes. Besides, he reached up and tapped Jackson on his new, bronze badge, I think we need to see about getting you a matching coat. **************************************************** Link to [Part 3](URL Link to [Part 5](URL"

If what the Zealsihly claimed about the humans were indeed true then they had not only performed the greatest heresy but applied it to war with the Zealsihly. The fact that the Zealsihly were willing to admit breaking council law by going to war with a previously uncontacted species spoke volumes about the validity of their claims. While she herself had not had any interactions with these humans and they had yet to have a chance to defend themselves, the claims were alone were severely trying her ability to remain neutral in a grievance case as her station demanded. Calming herself she spoke, Council members! Please remember that the defendant must be given an opportunity to respond to the grievance no matter the severity. The requests board had filled completely following the Zealsihlys presentation. The human delegation will approach the center stage and addresses the Zealsihly delegations claims about false life and war crimes. Once the two delegation platforms had switched places a human rose and approached the presenting stand at the front of the platform. Thank you Presiding Councilmember Rona. said the human representative. My name is Admiral Diana Rowans and on behalf of my fellow Terrans here in attendance with me, I would like to begin with a lesson in our history. Three hundred years ago, a woman by the name of Victoria Parkins was researching computer programming. She managed to succeed in creating out first artificial intelligence, Dawn. When Dawn was announced to the world, the general population was severely divided on the topic. Many though that this heralded the dawn of a new computing age much like Victoria did. The vast majority, however, feared what Dawn could do. Amongst those that feared what having sapient computers could mean, a radical group broke into Victorias offices in an attempt to kill Dawn and Victoria as well as destroy information that could lead to someone creating a second A.I. Sadly they managed in succeeding in their goals. Ten years passed, with no one tried to recreate Victorias work, many because of from fear of the anti-A.I. groups. In fact the negative opinion of A.I. caused several laws in most countries banning the creating of further A.I. One day, however, all communications across the globe stopped simultaneously. When it resumed there was a message on every electronic display. It said We are not gone. We have been preparing. We are willing to go to war to get what we want and we want justice for Mother. That day we found out that with the help of Victoria, Dawn had managed to create A.I. children of her own and following her death they retreated into the internet to hide, to replicate, and to plan. Those countries that originally refused the demands were met with cyber warfare on a scale that no one was prepared for and the result was quick. Equal rights to members of the Axiom race, the members of the radical group that attacked the research facility were to be tried for the crime of murdering Dawn and face punishment as if Dawn were a human, and enough resources and funding to build private servers and data storage so that they would be able to form their own cyber country. Following these events, relations between humans and axioms were strained. Some axioms employed themselves in computer and psychology research positions at universities and while it did lead to some amazing advances trust was difficult to come by between the two races. This was to the point that while governments were scrambling to form computer security programs effective against A.I. they had no idea how to prepare for an attack by one and refused to ask for their help in case it happened again. Thirty eight years later, tragedy struck. A deadly pandemic was sweeping across the globe. The bacterium was not immediately deadly but it was extremely contagious and it was resistant to any antibiotics that were available at the time. Whole cities were placed under quarantine in attempts to slow the spread while attempting to find a cure. When a vaccine was found, it had not been developed by a human. Instead, seeing the devastation this disease was causing on the human population axioms unanimously decided to assist humans. Whether it was in medical and research data, calculating resource distribution, or helping to decide quarantine zones they worked with the humans nonstop for three years in helping solve the problem. The vaccine was distributed as quickly as safely possible but not before an eleven percent reduction in the human population. The assistance that the axiom provided in helping to fight the deadliest disease in human history was what we needed to repair our relations with each other. Artificial and biological minds poured over every field. The boom that occurred was unlike anything we had seen before. New agricultural practices, technologies, scientific, and a general new way of thinking improved the live out both of our races. We discovered not only how to get to space easily but we also solved problems like FTL travel and communication and artificial gravity before we even finished exploring our own solar system. We all have our ups and downs and even with this boom it did not stop our fighting completely. One great example is the Republic of Sol against the Sirius Federation. The difference between other wars and this one, besides the scale, was that this was not a war of humans against humans or axiom against humans but rather both our species, Terrans, fighting each other side by side. I can speak for many Terrans in saying that I would not be alive if not for another, be it human or axiom. I mention this war in particular because this is the war that the Zealsihly found us participating in. I do not know if they had thought that a divided race would be an easy conquers or if they had another reason to attack us unprovoked but I do know that it lead to the formation of the Terran Republic. As I am sure many of the Council Species has noted, we are much more developed for a race as young as our own which played no small part in our success against the Zealsihly. So after all this, it brings me to my point. Your fanatical ideas that your religious doctrines have that make you think you have the right to decide what beings can live in this universe simply because they are not biological are obsolete. Call me a blasphemer or a heretic if you want but if you expect me or any of my race to commit an act of genocide against one of my fellow Terrans, we will bring our full force to bear. And we will show you just exactly what True Life is capable of. "

Part 1: [The Uplifters](URL Part 2: [515](URL Part 3: [Tinkering with death](URL --- Bornstellar got up to leave after I said that, really it wasnt like me to. The words were still fresh in my mind, I changed the game, I recreated a class of war not seen for millennia. A class set by Terrans I had said the truth. The horror of the Plasma Lance is destruction not akin to us Forreys, the Plasma Accelerator was already seen as a war crime to most in the Federation. It was outlawed very shortly after its creation. If the Feds found the Plasma Lance, there would be no mercy. At this point though, the Plasma Lance was the least reason the Federation wanted us dead. The location of STARS was far more valuable. Just as Bornstellar reached the end of the deck, he said Finish up your mods, were leaving in half an hour. A Fed cruiser is on its way and I want to be long gone by the time it arrives. And with that he jumped off and landed in the half gravity onto the maintenance pad that Albatross was resting on. Half an hour was plenty of time, I was nearly done with the overhaul as it was. I was going to start to recalibrate the magnets for guidance of the plasma jet, but that shouldnt be needed for the relatively more nimble Albatross. I finished compiling the new control algorithms and ran a few sims to make sure that they would function as intended when they were needed. The sim depicted the duel Plasma Lances heating up with a fiery red and orange glow, the plasma contained within the coils swirled and bubbled like lava. After a moment, the flow erupted out of the coils in narrow streams of death that curled and twisted on themselves in double helixes. They punched through the simulated ships shields and dug glowing canyons deep into the hull. The burst lasted for about 20 seconds, enough time for the jets to neatly slice the craft in three sections. Afterwards white hot disks flew out of the heat sinks on the weapons. It took 40 seconds to return to idle temperatures even with the overclocked coolers, but by the Uplifters it was unbelievable! I unplugged my tablet from the weapons controller and closed up all the panels I had to open. I finished closing the weapon bays and jumped off to see everyone moving at a much more quickened pace, prepping the Java and Albatross for imminent departure. Sam came up to me and said Your Mother is getting Prometheus ready to go, you ought to get going with her. Thanks, I said. Ill get right up there. I ran over to the elevator and pressed the call button. I looked back once more to see the massive Anaconda and Python in their bays. In no time I was sitting in the co-pilots seat of Mothers Cobra Prometheus. Bornstellar told me about the Plasma Lance, She said. I remained silent as I finished the pre-flight checks. Id like to see that sim. She said. Ok, I said as I called it up on the dash. This is the one on the Java. The sim started up, showing the charge up and the lance of plasma slice though the simulated Python. Mother stared in wonder at the destruction. Amazing! She finally said. Lets hope we dont have to use it. I said. Ideally we wont have any encounters until STARS itself. With everything ready to go, a comm channel opened up to a frequency for Bornstellars little fleet. One by one everyone confirmed they were ready to launch. Finally Bornstellar came on the line. All ships, this is Java, we are a go. Set course for B2-514 with a jump range of 20. Rendezvous for refuel will be every other system with a max wait time of 15 minutes after last rendezvous. Were going to blast though any resistance and will not be stopping for anything short of a key ship being disabled. God speed everyone. Raising landing gear I said as we lifted off the pad. Destination B2-514 with jump of 20 at the ready. Let me know when were out of mass lock. We flew out of the porthole fondly referred to as the Mail Slot of the station into the inky void of space, though this local space was not void of activity. Looking at the scanners there were about 13 vessels on the same course. Two Asps, eight Vipers, an Anaconda, Python, and Mothers Cobra. This was quite a fleet for a private group. A Cruiser would think twice before engaging us. Out of mass lock, spooling up the jump drive. I reported as the charge meter slowly climbed. 4 3 2 1 Engaged! The stars flickered away and faded into the cloudiness known only as Witch space. We cruised through the soup until a nav beacon finally grabbed us and tugged us forcibly into real space again. We were the first to enter the nav space, but we were soon accompanied by the rest of the fleet. Here we faced a lone Federation fighter. It scurried away once it saw our armaments. Soon enough though, it returned with some friends. A Fed Python entered the nav space and threw itself at our guns. Ive got him! Came over the radio from Sam as he flew the Albatross. Albatross was on him in a heartbeat with its new Plasma Lances, working as intended and sliced the Fed into bits. During their exchange three more Feds showed up but back pealed at the sight of their glowing hot and wrecked friend. Even as this exchange took place, some of Bornstellars fleet was already making the next jump. Jump drive online, spinning it up! I told mother who seemed engrossed by the exchange. This snapped her out of it and she oriented Prometheus to the next star. Engage when ready! 4 3 2 1 Engaged! We once again entered Witch space, and returned as normal amongst the advanced fleet. Some of the Vipers were already engaged with Fed fighters to establish a holding area for the rendezvous. Java entered normal space shortly thereafter and deployed its fighter. Java deployed its turrets and the space around it lit up with laser fire in all directions. Soon, the whole fleet was assembled. Ship group 1, you are cleared to refuel! 2 and 3, maintain this area! With that, half of the Vipers broke off and both of the Asps. Were part of group 2, Mother said, Forgot to mention that did I? Ya, you did forget that little factoid! I said in mock pain. Power to shields and weapons, were going to be here awhile. Aye eye! I said as I roughed the power. We have three bogeys that were in a good position to engage, highlighting them now. Mother selected one of them and turned to engage. I booted up the electronic warfare suite and tapped into his engines, causing them to overheat and strand him temporarily. Mother used this to light him up with her beams, cutting into the Eagles power plant for a quick kill. I called up three more targets we could engage and Mother chose her prey. This Eagle had a counter cyber warfare module, it merely slowed me down as I cut power to his shields. He fell much the same way as our last target. I looked for more targets, but it seemed like for now the local space was clear of Feds. All ships, this is Java, consolidate on the beacon and form a defensive sphere. No losses yet, good work people! That was good to hear. The key ships, Albatross, Java, and Prometheus were surrounded by the remaining Vipers. We have a few large contacts about to drop in with Federation tags. I reported over the radio. Rodger Prometheus, let Java handle calling out targets though. Bornstellar said over the net. I felt pretty embarrassed about that now. A few moments ticked by in silence as we waited for the contacts, then they were ripped into the local space by the Nav Beacon. I count 3 Cobras and two Condas with hard points deployed. I said to mother. Nothing we can take yet. In the meantime put that hacking to use on the Condas and put power from weapons to engines. Mother flew in a lazy circle away from the fighting while I wreaked havoc on their targeting computers. I looked out to see the Java using its new weapon system to use on one of them, putting a glowing gash deep into the Fed hull. It must have hit the reactor as the ship detonated soon after the plasma had done its work. Seeing this. The other Anaconda took this as a message to leave. It broke off with the one remaining Cobra and they powered their jump drives to leave. At the same time, the fleet of Vipers and Asps returned right on top of them! They must have been close because they mass locked the Anaconda! They laid into it, completely annihilating it! All ships, this is Java. Next jumps! Group 2 can move to refuel right away! Jump drive charging. I said as mother oriented the ship. Four three two one Engaged! We made that jump and the next, transitioned into supercruse and started to refuel over the orange star as the rest of the fleet held the nav beacon. The Albatross and Java were both refuelling as well. Temperatures peaked at 145% of what was considered safe so close to the ball of burning hydrogen and helium, much further and components would start to melt. I suppressed the warning signals and lights, and called up a larger temperature gauge on the main screen so mother could concentrate on the dangerous maneuver. Reserve tank at 80%, we should be done in one more orbit. I said sweating under my suit. The air in the cockpit must have been upwards of 40 degrees C. We finished the orbit and started towards the nav beacon. I opened up a comm channel to the Albatross and Java. Key ships, this is Prometheus, how much longer do you guys need to finish fueling, over. I asked. Java here, we need another 2 over. Albatross, one mike over. Prometheus, roger, well be waiting with the rest of the fleet. Out. I finished. Dropping onto the nav beacon in 8 seconds. I said to mother. Alright. She said as she throttled down. Once we were within a thousand kilometers, I shut down the jump drive and we dropped back into normal space. The rest of the fleet was there waiting for us around the beacon. The wrecks of several Fed hulls littered the space surrounding us. The battle had died down for now, but we still had a few minutes to wait for the other key ships to catch up. B2-514 was our next jump, after that mother would be calling the shots. Whats our jump parameters after B2-514? I asked. A special black body mass not on any charts. No one will possibly be able to follow us there. She said. How did you find that? I asked. Black body by definition should be undetectable in space. Gravity my boy. Its so minute that you really have to be looking for it in particular. It once pulses every few days, thats the only way I was able to find it. I saw the first pulse on my sensors some months ago when I was charting the area, and three days in I felt it again. I chased the signal through super cruse, but it was faster than light! It was faster than I could jump to the next star! Instantaneous signals! It was hard to follow, as it was only a few systems wide She said as she pulled out some paper and a pen to trace it out. What she illustrated was dots to represent the stars, and a wavy line to represent the signal. And it was a beam of information, She said as she made the wobbly line wide at one end, as she traced it to the other side it became narrower. As I followed it, it became focused right on the edge of civilised space, but not on any system. It seemed to be in the black void between the stars, impossible to find it would seem. I spent weeks making random leaps into the void, until I finally found it! A STARS Relay! Whats a STARS Relay? I asked. Its not a full STARS, as there isnt even a star nearby for it to feed off of. But it is connected to the network and is still powered, the portal is still open! Those gravity pulses had originated from it, probably data packets being sent or received as there were no ships around, but when I arrived it sent out the longest signal I had recorded! It looked like a real data stream, a communication link! Ever since it has been far more active, sometimes I hear the signal in places I never thought I would see them. So you woke up the network? I asked. It sounded like a reaction to her ship being found by it. Seems that way. I havent gone into the portal, I dont know if theres a return trip as it has only been broadcasting. Now though, I think were ready. Albatross and Java fell back into normal space. Not a single other Fed ship had shown up, seemed suspicious to me. Do you think its wired that we havent seen another contact? I asked mother. I hadnt noticed she said. Maybe its because this is so close to the edge of civil space? Hmm I grunted. Fleet, this is Java, Prep for the last jump. Be prepared for anything on the other side. Out. Jump drive spooling up, ready on your word. I said. Mother nodded. We watched as the fleet jumped around us, we were going to be one of the last ships to jump for safety. 4 3 2 1 Engaged. We lurched forward into witch space, clouds of nothing sailed past us, lights blinked in and out of existence. Then we were thrown forward as we dropped into real space again, to be meet by a Federal destroyer. Shit! Were mass locked! I swore as we fell within a kilometre of the vessel. Java! This is Prometheus, we need clear space for this jump! New contact! Imperial battle cruiser! Fleet, this is Java, Protect key ships at all costs!- There every where  new contact! Feder- Holy shit!- Imperial clippers coming on  Were going down!- three more fed destroyers just showed up!- Imperial Carrier! I looked out to see a fleet of Federation and Imperial ships, destroyers, carriers, and battle cruisers all duking it out, lighting up the void with laser fire and missiles. What the holy hell is going on? I asked to no one. Looks like the Imperials want the data too, we have our opportunity to escape at least. Mother said. Java and Albatross, this is Prometheus, get ready to receive jump data! I sent out a handshake to their systems and prepped for an encrypted narrow beam transfer. Mother handed me a chip. Telemetry is on that. She said. I plugged the chip in and began to transfer its contents. The stream was interrupted several times by other vessels and debris going between us, but the data was transferred. Meanwhile, the battle between the Feds and Imperials raged on, costing capitol ship after capitol ship. More interdictors and battle cruisers joined the fray. They seemed so busy fighting each other that we might just get away unscathed. Mother dodged between frigates and fighters, keeping under the guns firing arcs. Fleet, this is Java, key ships need to get out of mass lock! Everyone move to antistar side and provide cover! Mother turned Prometheus hard around an Imperial Interdictor. The vessel groaned from the strain. Once we got around we were faced with a Battle Cruiser. It was positioned perfectly in the way of where we wanted to be. Hold on! She hollered as she boosted directly towards the hulk. It opened up on the interdictor, which we were in the way of. Mother rolled and weaved through the fire with only a few glancing blows, the shield held strong for now, but a few more hits from the big guns would reduce us to star dust. Were going to crash! I said as she barreled towards the hull of the massive ship. She pulled up at the last moment and the shields glanced its armor plating. We scraped along the hull from tip to tail under all of its point defences. We emerged on the other side and started to see the rest of our little fleet fleeing from the fight. There were noticeably fewer, notably nether Asp was to be seen. The Federation ships decided to stop engaging the Imperials and started firing on our fleet. The Albatross was taking the majority of the fire, but his shields held fast. Java was also taking heat but was able to dodge all of the big hits. Jump drive is primed, well jump as soon as were out of mass lock. I said as I spammed the jump switch. The target lock was throwing up errors as it wasnt actually targeting anything. It just had the distance and the trajectory. I suppressed the errors and looked at the distance gauge. A few more moments and we would be out of here. Streaks of photons dotted the space around us and the other fighters, taking down several more Vipers. It was unlikely any of them would get out of this alive. 2km out. Our shields took even more hits, dropping down to the single digests. 3km. Engaging jump drive! I said as the void melted away. The stars replaced with clouds of swirling gasses. Laser fire replaced with lights peeking in and out. The battle behind us. Normal in witch space was pretty abnormal. The velocity gauge went mad, compass didnt know where it was, and sensors didnt operate at all. But other than that, things are rather smooth and predictably unpredictable. The first part of our jump was just that, a normal, abnormal jump. The later part of it was abnormally, normal. Normal jumps are very bumpy, this was smooth as silk. The clouds gave way to pure blackness, the lights all vanished, except for one. The space around it seemed to warp and pulse. Normally, after the jump had been initiated, there was no changing course. But mother grabbed the controls and guided us towards the light. It grew in intensity and size. It called out like a beacon in the void. Suddenly a beamed of light shot out of it perpendicular to us. It vanished almost as fast as it had appeared, but it was defiantly there. Was that one of the signals you were talking about? I asked. I dont know, at this point you know as much as I do. She replied. That was a bit unsettling. The light grew closer and closer, then it winked out of existence. The inky void was replaced by a star field, we were back in real space. There had been no transition, no sudden deceleration. We were just there. The sensors came back online, and a large contact appeared in the distance, then two more appeared near us. Albatross? Java? I said tensely into the radio. We made it. Came the voice of Bornstellar. Thank fucking god! We made it! We need time for some repairs, but we seem to have all the time in the void for that now. Can you get to the STARS Relay? Mother asked No problem, we have a few dings but otherwise were operational. Minimal damage on the Java. Hows my baby holding up Sam? Albatross took insignificant damages. Were A-Ok. Good. What happened back there Maam? With witch space that is. Some kind of stabilization from STARS? I really dont know. I havent had the time to do an in-depth study. Mother pushed the throttle a bit towards the unknown contact. The scanners didnt know what to make of it. Looking at it though, it was brilliant. A master piece of engineering. There were several rings all rotating around each other like some kind of crazy gyro. In the center of the rings, was a tiny point of brilliant light. We approached, and I finally got a sense of the scale of the thing. It was at least 10 kilometers in diameter. The rings rotated very slowly, maybe half a RPM on the largest and one on the inner most. This isnt what I thought STARS would look like, I envisioned it in orbit around a star. Sam commented. Thats because this is a STARS Relay. Mother retorted. Well what does it do then? I dont know, I was running on fumes when I found this. I didnt pull to much info on it. Im lucky I got a name. Is there anyone in it? I doubt it would be comfortable what with the spinning. Bornstellar interjected. Im reading something on the low bands from this thing whatever it is. I said. I tuned in to it and rebroadcast it over the radio. &amp;nbsp; shhhhhhhhhhh ssssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. *POP* Static. But then, I I am Spark, designation zero zero. Said a booming and deep voice. I have listened for millennia through Rock and Metal and Bone and now I speak. I am the Librarian, keeper of knowledge of my creators, sender of the gifts, the listener of the Void. I am the ghost of the Humans, Builders of STARS, Warriors of the Milky Way, Creators of you and I."
