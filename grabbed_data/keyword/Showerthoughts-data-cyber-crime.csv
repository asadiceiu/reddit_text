1,cyber-crime,Showerthoughts,Does law enforcement like shows like CSI because it makes them look better equipped then they are IRL to stop crime as a public deterrent?,3,544gz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/544gz5/does_law_enforcement_like_shows_like_csi_because/,2016-09-23 22:36:07,"Shows like this have magical bottomless skilled resources and impossible turn around times to get results of DNA, cyber crime tracking, trace processing. IRL there are many large cities with backlogs of evidence to process (some time sensitive going bad) that will take years to clear due to funding etc. So are shows like this made to help make the public think the law works more efficiently then it does so you don't try crime? The side effect possibly being why there is less public funding for law enforcement / data processing because on mass people think they already have all this amazing stuff and easy jobs? Or is it just simplified entertainment that has to fit in 40mins with a ton of commercials so things move fast? "
2,cyber-crime,Showerthoughts,The new playground and cyber bullying,1,55sr87,https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/55sr87/the_new_playground_and_cyber_bullying/,2016-10-04 20:54:47,"Bullying is clearly not a new phenomenon but the context has now shifted to a new and different form which is related to the growth of new media platforms. It is so sad to write at a time when we hear of the suicide of a 7 year old in Bradford and this reminds us of the very damaging consequences of bullying. Reports indicate that the extent of what has become known as cyber bullying is a growing international problem. Whilst organisations and individuals are increasingly getting involved in the field it would be fair to say that the research base is weak and the level of support available to those seriously impacted by this is not sufficiently robust. Humans can be immeasurably cruel and especially so in childhood. According to bullying.co.uk 56% of young people said they have seen others be bullied online and 42% have felt unsafe online. Cyber bullying can happen 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and it can go viral very fast. Against this background a conference has been set in Nottingham on the 3rd November to try and make sense of the many issues that exist with cyber bullying and given the technology and psychology behind this kind of behaviour it is perhaps appropriate to relate the context to bullying in a new playground. Robin Morris Jones, director of the Cognitive Centre who are hosting the conference is a recognised expert in cognitive behavioural interventions. He said ""Our aim is to ensure parents, teachers and those responsible for the care of children and young people are aware of the risks involved with unlimited access to social media. We risk endangering our young people when we do not address this increasingly urgent issue. Understanding and identifying the boundaries between online bullying, abuse and criminal behaviour is vital."" The conference features speakers from a wide range of academic, regulatory and charitable bodies including Childnet International, University of Central Lancashire, The Diana Award and Derbyshire Digital PCSO. Timed for the run up to National Anti Bullying Week 14  18 November the event marks a major milestone for The Cognitive Centre, whose previous conferences, focusing primarily on domestic abuse and 'Working with 'difficult' individuals"" have all been based in London and Manchester. Wendy Cooper from the Cognitive Centre said ""We have chosen Nottingham for this conference as we are currently working with Derbyshire Constabularys Digital PCSO and its Cyber Crime hub. Nottinham offers a wealth of hotels, conference venues and is centrally located with easy access for both UK based and European delegates"". The conference set for 3rd November opens with a leading expert Dr Jo Bryce to set the scene in relation to the research base. Will Gardner, CEO Childnet International and Alex Holmes, Head of Anti-Bullying Programme, The Diana Award will outline the current initiatives. Derbyshire police will demonstrate an initiative whereby the use of technology is used to engage with young people and parents. A representative from a UK charity 'Bullies Out' will discuss initiatives that have been used in direct work with young people. The Cognitive Centre are specialists in providing consultancy, training and support to organisations that want to work effectively with people. Their clients include agencies working with vulnerable children, also mental health, counselling, and human resource professionals in clinical, managed care, forensic, education, and corporate organisations.

3,cyber-crime,Showerthoughts,Why don't shows like CSI: Cyber hire computer tech experts or people from places like /r/itsaunixsystem as creative consultants?,2,34f9sh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/34f9sh/why_dont_shows_like_csi_cyber_hire_computer_tech/,2015-05-01 03:38:44,"I see crime shows get posted on that place all the time, and it doesn't seem like they're fixing any of the inconsistencies or incorrect usage of computer technology. If anything, it's getting worse. Why don't they hire someone who's an expert who can point out all the flaws that the shows make? The shortcomings are usually easy to identify, so why not make shows about cyber crime a little more realistic and a little less ridiculous? It's not rocket science, *it's computer science!*"
4,cyber-crime,Showerthoughts,Will society's obsession with legal and criminal dramas lead to a generation of extremely prepared criminals?,0,2xtjw4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/2xtjw4/will_societys_obsession_with_legal_and_criminal/,2015-03-04 06:44:22,"The sheer number of television series (and episodes within each) dedicated to different crimes and what mistakes the criminals did or did not make has to be multiplied by the popularity of the genre. The exposure is huge. Additionally, I feel like people are attracted to the shows in large part because they focus on such small details of the crime, scene, or investigation that people are subliminally being trained on how to commit the ""perfect"" crime whether it be petty thief, cyber bullying, or murder."
