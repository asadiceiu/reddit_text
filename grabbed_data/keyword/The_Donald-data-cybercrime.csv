TRUMP IS NEEDED DOWN UNDER TO SAVE US FROM CHINER AND OUR DUMBOCRAT ELEETS ARE INVITING IN CHINER!,0,bmvfa3,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/bmvfa3/sos_trump_is_needed_down_under_to_save_us_from/,2019-05-10 17:40:27,"Very important stuff from Clive Hamilton today: Understanding Chinas Threat to Australias National Security As long at the Communist Party rules China it will pose a persistent and serious threat to Australias national security. Over the last two years we have made considerable progress in setting up defences against Beijings subversion and covert influence. But we have only just begun a decade-long project, at least, of undoing the influence networks that the CCP has already established. Momentum is being slowed by institutional inertia, and Beijing has mobilized its friends of China among Australias elites to push back, including attempts to erode public confidence in our intelligence agencies. Beijing is exploiting our democratic processes, our legal system, and our free press. Its also exploiting multiculturalism as a cover for its influence activities. The accusation of Sinophobia or anti-Chinese prejudice is a powerful silencing device. Those whose voices have been most quieted are of course ChineseAustralians who want to speak out for human rights in China, or against the injustices in Tibet and Xinjiang. We are only now becoming aware that Beijings interference in our political system goes well beyond the activities of wealthy, Party-linked donors. In recent years, the Chinese Communist Party, through its global United Front network, has been actively encouraging trusted members of Chinese communities in countries like Australia to become directly involved in running 1 Professor of public ethics, Charles Sturt University, Canberra. 2 for political office, a policy known as huaren canzheng (pronounced hua wren ts-an jung). The policy, literally meaning ethnic Chinese political participation, also involves mobilising overseas Chinese community organisations to form one unified voice, and supporting mainstream candidates who have a correct understanding of Chinese people and China. Political organizations with names like the Chinese Labor Association and the Chinese Liberal Club are now operating inside Australias two main political parties. Some members of them are using their growing influence to promote Beijings interests. This approach is related to the mixing sand (chan shazi) tactic advocated by Mao Zedong, that is, planting trusted people in the enemys ranks in order to weaken them. Unlike Russia, which carried out an ambitious campaign of interference intended to benefit Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the CCP is bipartisan in its activities in Australia. It aims to build influence across the political spectrum, and be able to sway whomever wins. Huaren canzheng has been actively promoted by Huang Xiangmo, the real estate mogul and political donor who in February was excluded from Australia because of ASIOs concerns about his CCP links. When in 2015 he was president of the Australian Council for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification of China, the core United Front organisation, Huang wrote an article titled On the new age of huaren canzheng. Its vital, he wrote, to rally ethnic Chinese forces to use their ballots, make political donations and master the rules of the political game. In recent years, United Front groups in Australia have been holding training seminars to encourage trusted Chinese-Australians to participate in politics. Theyre aimed particularly at young Chinese-Australians who are more integrated into Australian society. Huang Xiangmo wrote of the need to nurture those with bilingual skills who can walk through the revolving door of politics, business and academia with ease. In addition, for some years CCP agencies have been organizing so-called Discovery Trips to China for overseas Chinese. There they meet senior Chinese government leaders, listen to speeches given by experts, attend discussion forums and build networks. This program is part of the CCPs broader qiaowu program, which CCP expert James Jiann Hua To describes as a massive operation aimed at co-opting overseas Chinese and managing their behaviour and perceptions through incentives or disincentives to suit the situation and structural circumstances that the CCP desires. In short, both the training seminars in Australia and the Discovery Trips to China are elements of a CCP program designed to groom young ChineseAustralians to serve the interests of the Party-state. Some candidates currently standing for election to federal parliament have participated in these training programs and the Discovery Trips to China. They also have close links with United Front organisations and influential figures from the Chinese diaspora who act on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party. Over the last 18 months, some 15 federal politicians have been disqualified because of their dual citizenship. They fell afoul of Section 44 of the Constitution, which rules ineligible anyone who is a citizen of another country. Now the parties are doing their due diligence by forensically checking each potential candidate for dual citizenship. The trips are organised by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office and China Overseas Exchange Association, both agencies of the Chinese Communist Partys United Front Work Department (UFWD), a powerful branch of the CCP tasked with influencing and controlling groups outside the party, including groups located abroad. But the same clause of Section 44 also disqualifies any person who is under any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power. The political parties ought to be doing their due diligence to rule out any potential candidates who are engaged in United Front activity. As the CCPs huaren canzheng policy begins to bear fruit federally, as it already has done in state parliaments and local councils, sooner or later I expect to see an MP challenged in the High Court. We know that ASIO is gathering more detailed information on Beijings attempts to co-opt Chinese-Australians and has expressed concern about CCPlinked individuals entering parliaments. (In Canada, where the process of penetration has gone further, CSIS has done likewise, although its warnings have been dismissed by a compromised political class.) Such a High Court challenge would be disastrous for future representation of the Chinese-Australian community in federal parliament, so the parties must start thinking much more carefully about this problem. It should be stressed that Chinese-Australians are under-represented in Australian political office and more should be encouraged to enter politics, but not if they are liable to be disqualified under Section 44. *** Our intelligence and law enforcement authorities have, by all accounts, been highly effective at identifying and arresting actual and potential terrorists. By contrast, they have been reluctant to prosecute individuals engaged in economic espionage and spying. In recent years, the United States has launched a series of high-profile prosecutions of Chinese spies and agents of influence who have engaged in unlawful activity. Even Canada, which is more in thrall to Beijing than Australia, has put spies before the courts. Yet in Australia there have been none. This is not for want of malign activity, as recent ASIO reports have made clear, but for lack of political will. Fear of Beijings ire is allowing its program of data theft, information gathering and cyber-hacking to proliferate. And with the passage last year of the Espionage and Foreign Interference Act there is a new crime to tackle. Foreign interference is a crime if it involves activity that is covert, directed or funded by a foreign principal, and is intended to influence a political or governmental process or the exercise of a democratic or political right . Such activity has been rampant in Australia, as a reading of my book will reveal. State police forces have, or ought to have, a large share of the responsibility for uncovering and prosecuting individuals engaged in unlawful foreign interference. Most of it takes place at a local level. Yet state police forces have not committed the resources to understanding the nature and extent of foreign interference that is taking place in their backyards. Admittedly, its a daunting task. They must first develop a comprehensive map of United Front actors and organisations, and then work out what kind of activity might be unlawful. It means penetrating a world that is opaque and unfamiliar. The modus operandi of the CCP is like nothing we have experienced before; certainly the old rules of the Cold War are not of much use, and viewing it through a le Carr lens only obscures things. Fortunately, there are members of the Chinese-Australian community very willing to help. But there is another strong reason for state police forces to put themselves at the forefront of investigating foreign interference. Just as the Kremlin uses criminal gangs to carry out some of its work, and oligarchs have business partnerships with organised crime bosses, there has always been a nexus between the Chinese Communist Partys overseas influence activities and criminal gangs. In Canada, the media has exposed evidence of enormous sums of dark money from China being laundered through Vancouver casinos and real estate. Some of the criminals have political links, both in China and in Canada. The provincial and federal governments have been reluctant to face up to the problem and do something about it. The reasons are complex: it looks overwhelming, the crooks have friends in high places, the crippling fear of accusations of xenophobia, and billions of dollars flowing into government coffers from gambling. I am asking myself whether Australia is in the same boat, ignoring major crimes that are mixed up in political influence activity?FBI Director Christopher Wray recently commented on another aspect of the merging of crime and politics. He said the FBI is focusing on what he called a blended threat where cybercrime and espionage merge together in all kinds of new ways. He described how China, above all, poses a severe intelligence threat because its stealing U.S. assets like advanced technology and commercial innovations, and collecting information for political use. And then he said something that we in Australia are reluctant to admit. China [by which he meant the CCP] has pioneered a societal approach to stealing innovation in any way it can from a wide array of businesses, universities and organizations. Theyre doing it through Chinese intelligence services, through state-owned enterprises, through ostensibly private companies, through graduate students and researchers, through a variety of actors all working on behalf of China. The term blended threat refers to nation states using criminal hackers; but here I am describing something slightly different, criminals becoming agents of influence for nation states, and nation states willingly using them. 7 All of this is being played out in Australia too; yet we do not want to admit it, for fear of being accused of racial profiling or because of our anxieties about annoying Beijing. ASIO has a good idea of the landscape, and has been writing about it in recent annual reports. The Director-General Duncan Lewis put it succinctly when he wrote that foreign actors are aggressively seeking access to privileged and classified information on Australias alliances, on our diplomatic, technological, economic and military secrets and on our energy and mineral resources. These foreign actors, he wrote: are also attempting to clandestinely influence the opinions of members of the Australian public and media, Australian Government officials, and members of Australia-based diaspora communities. Yet the Director-General would not name China as the party overwhelmingly responsible for this subversion and espionage. In fact, China is not mentioned once in ASIOs report. Russia is, several times; even earning an index entry Russian intelligence activity in Australia. Theres no entry for China even though Chinas intelligence activity is a hundred-fold greater. This is exactly how Beijing wants it: a thorough program of espionage and subversion that we are too afraid to talk about. The same coyness was on display in February when it was revealed that a sophisticated state actor had hacked into the computer systems of both of our main political parties. The government would not reveal the source of the attack, although it knew it was China. Again, the government was intimidated into silence by Beijing. The message we are sending is that if you do it again we will not call you out. The contrast with the United States could not be sharper. There, in addition to forthright statements from the FBI and the CIA directors, the US-China 8 Economic and Security Review Commission recently issued a report to Congress describing Chinas subversive activities, as far as they are known. A bill is moving through Congress that would legislate for an annual report detailing Chinas interference activities. *** Sunlight is the best disinfectant against Beijings covert, coercive and corrupt activities in Australia. Yet, the Australian government is keeping us in the dark, leaving the task of pulling back the curtains to a handful of journalists and academics, who must then take the blowback. The best source of information on Beijings activities is of course the Chinese-Australian community itself. They do much more than we know; yet they live in fear of material retribution from the CCP and its agents. And, its sad to say, they dont believe that the Australian government will adequately protect them. If we are to prevail in this new era of political warfare, to use the CCPs term, a whole-of-society threat requires a whole-of-society response; but that cannot happen if the public is kept in the dark. At the moment, the government is signalling that there is a serious threat to our sovereignty and our democratic system. Yet it seems to be saying leave it to us, we will take care of it. Even a determined government cannot respond adequately to this new kind of threat. U.S. authorities are further down the track. They have been engaged in a major outreach exercise to American companies and universities, to explain the nature of the risks they face from Chinas network of influence and technology theft. Something like this has been taking place in Australia on a smaller and more tentative scale, but so much more needs to be done. Its clear that our universities, in particular, are resistant to hearing the message and continue to expose themselves to a range of risks. For example, some Australian universities have entered into partnerships with Chinese companies and universities that are likely steal their intellectual property. The universities claim they do due diligence on the Chinese companies they partner with. But the companies they pay to carry out due diligence do not know what to look for or how to look. Work by Alex Joske has exposed many instances of Australian universities happily hosting Chinese scientists who turn out to be officers of the Peoples Liberation Army specialising in weapons research and other military-related research. Not only are universities unaware but, when its pointed out, some dont appear to be unduly worried. To borrow a metaphor from one authority on the CCP (Frank Diktter), they are like Boy Scouts up against Don Corleone. In the cyber domain, I think the public, along with government organizations and private companies, have been persuaded that they need to do more to protect their information from cyber attackers, including sophisticated state actors. But its a mistake to think that all they need to do is harden their perimeter defences against outside threats. Possibly the greater threat comes from within, insider threats, or malicious insiders as ASIO has called them. As you know, all it takes is for someone with access to a computer network to stick into a port a USB that then downloads malware. It would be incorrect to think that the risk is from MSS moles being sent in. Thats le Carr thinking. Far more likely is an employee who comes under great pressure to engage in malicious activity. Its a much harder problem to respond to sensitively, but the starting point is to frame it correctly, and that is that most Chinese-Australians are the victims here. Lastly, building on its almost total domination of Chinese-language media in Australia, Beijing has weaponised Chinese-language social media. WeChat is used heavily by most Chinese-Australians. Many rely on it as their main source of news and opinion. Now, accounts are being doctored and fake news stories are being spread to shape opinions in electorates with large diaspora populations. WeChat is owned by Chinese conglomerate Tencent, which is controlled by Ma Huateng (Pony Ma), Chinas richest man and a firm supporter of the Party. WeChat cannot be regulated by Australian authorities, but it is subject to censorship in Beijing. This means that Australian politicians using WeChat to communicate with voters are censoring themselves, or rather their Mandarinspeaking staff members censor their posts so as not to attract the attention of Beijings censors. The Labor Party has written to Tencent to complain about fake news stories on WeChat. WeChat is not subject to pressure like Facebook or Twitter, so its a futile exercise, if a necessary one. I would urge those politicians to challenge the censors by sending out posts condemning the outrages in Xinjiang or praising the Dalai Lama, as a way of standing up for free speech in Australia. Beyond that, we must come up with innovative responses to Beijings exploitation of free speech. My essential message then is that we are faced with a new kind of adversary that practices espionage and political interference in ways that are alien to us as experts. They are practices that subtly exploit the openness of our institutions and the boundaries we place around them. They operate in the grey zone. We are being forced to take a crash course in a new world of huaren canzheng, citizen spies and blended threats. To respond will require great flexibility in the way we think and a willingness to adapt our institutions."

So this was used as reasonable suspicion to justify a FISA Warrant. Is this really the standard for investigations? Where false and flimsy evidence is pursued and real crimes are not? We had an FBI that can't confirm or deny the existence of an any investigation but [Ex-Director James Comey, himself, announced the existence of classified emails on Clinton's private server and devices and that work related emails were not all turned over.](URL [Hillary Clinton's setup was not encrypted either](URL or [secure](URL and her severs and devices could have been [vulnerable to hacking](URL while she was the Secretary of State.

Now, back to the CrowdStrike narrative about claiming [Russians hacked the DNC](URL First of all, CrowdStrike isn't only criticized for its DNC hack claim, but its credibility also comes into question with claims about how [Russia targeted Ukrainian Artillery](URL IISS themselves criticize CrowdStrike by claiming that [no losses or hacking occurred](URL The report itself lives up to [scruntiny](URL Before trying to explain forensics for profiling hackers we must understand why [attribution isn't foolproof](URL What I find striking are these two points made by Cybersecurity researcher and consultant, Jeffrey Carr: 1. Why attribution **alone** doesn't work in cybercrime accusations. &gt; When it comes to cybersecurity estimates of attribution, no one holds the company that makes the claim accountable because theres no way to prove whether the assignment of attribution is true or false unless (1) there is a criminal conviction, (2) the hacker is caught in the act, or (3) a government employee leaked the evidence. 2. An [Intelligence analysis](URL done by Maj. Robert D. Folker, Jr. in 2000 published by the Joint Military Intelligence College. &gt; ""After reading the scenarios members of the control group formed a conclusion, then went back to the scenario to find evidence that supported their conclusion and ignored contradictory evidence. When asked to justify their answers, analysts in the control group often cited some key information that gave them a flash of insight."" &gt; ""Members of the experimental group examined all evidence provided in the scenario prior to making their decision. They felt confident that they were making the best decision they could with the amount of information available. They acknowledged that their decision may not be the right one and added that if more evidence became available they would reevaluate their conclusion taking into account this new information."" Carr also states, &gt; ""Many of the cyber intelligence analysts who work at companies like CrowdStrike, FireEye, and Mandiant have come out of the military or the Intelligence Community with prior analytic training."" Many fall victim to making conclusions first then reaffirming them with evidence, but especially when interpreting things such as cybercrime and warfare. Another thing mentioned by Carr, &gt; Unlike Crowdstrike, ESET doesnt assign APT28/Fancy Bear/Sednit to a Russian Intelligence Service or anyone else for a very simple reason. Once malware is deployed, it is no longer under the control of the hacker who deployed it or the developer who created it. It can be reverse-engineered, copied, modified, shared and redeployed again and again by anyone. In other words  malware deployed is malware enjoyed! In fact, the source code for X-Agent, which was used in the DNC, Bundestag, and TV5Monde attacks, was obtained by ESET as part of their investigation! During our investigations, we were able to retrieve the complete Xagent source code for the Linux operating system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this Xagent source code has been found and documented by security researchers. This source code is a fully working C++ project, which was used by Sednit operators to compile a binary in July 2015 (at least). If ESET could do it, so can others. It is both foolish and baseless to claim, as Crowdstrike does, that X-Agent is used solely by the Russian government when the source code is there for anyone to find and use at will. So now that the innate plausible deniability of this type crime has been examined, lets see what possibilities exist with public malware. Wikileaks [released CIA documents](URL known as [Vault 7](URL that covers the CIA intensive and sophisticated computer [hacking programs](URL Remember earlier that the malware is up for grabs upon release? Well the [CIA collects malware](URL from other hackers as well and this shows an effect tactic and potential plausible deniability at play. Now, while I'm not suggesting that the CIA breached the DNC like some [articles](URL do, I am suggesting this is a legitimate technique that hackers use and that its difficult to find a suspect with attribution, let alone finding involvement with government or state-party. It is almost worth nothing to adopt or tweak other persons software, but more time and resources are required to originally create software. Since the CIA had severely damaged everyone's security in the process of this cyberweapons arsenal buildup, [Assange himself offered to help companies fix exploits in their software](URL In addition even though hacking capability is important for the CIA, they also have the ability to [attribute false ""fingerprints""](URL to cyber attacks, covered under the group named UMBRADGE. More evidence that compiling software for false attribution to malware is possible. So now that the claim of Russian hacking itself is weakened, is there anything that contradicts the report? While I don't think it is necessary at this point to continue because of the speculative nature of attribution, and the fact that the burden of proof lies with the claimant. Although I don't fully agree, I will list the counter arguments against the Russian Hack narrative to be fair. 1. [Warren Flood's, a data-analyst for Obama](URL name was found in the [metadata of the Guccifer 2.0 documents](URL While this suggests argues that Guccifer 2.0 was an inside job, its more reasonable that the metadata contradicts the original claim of Crowdstrike, and further proves that attribution is still unreliable. 2. [Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) claims that the download speeds for the Guccifer 2.0 hack would be to fast for internet transfer, making a local transfer more plausible.] (URL It is flawed because it assumes that there are no ISPs or networks that offer connections that fast. However, it still makes the transfer speed implausible for certain parts of the world and certain computer networks with multiple nodes, so this part of the premise is more plausible as to rule out certain attack vectors for the hack. What is the most deadly is that the government and media advance this narrative to be an active and significant player in surveillance, disinformation, and censorship. Now we return to [Trump's claim that Obama illegally wiretapped Trump tower](URL Now we know for fact the NSA already sweeps up and collects most Americans' private data from [Downstream](URL (Indirectly from Websites, Email providers, Social Media, etc.) programs like PRISM [Edward Snowden](URL leaked and [Upstream](URL (Directly from Telecoms or Internet Service Providers) programs like STORMBREW. We even have whistle blower and ex-NSA Technical Director William Binney [reaffirming the nature](URL of the upstream dragnets and ""At least 80% of fibre-optic cables globally go via the US"". So there's no real reason to argue pointless semantical meanings about the word ""wiretap"" so fiercely. Inlight of these programs, the agencies deny surveillance and active targeting. [Ron Wyden asked Ex-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper](URL if the NSA collects data on Americans. James Clapper responds, &gt; ""No, sir."" This has to be a lie right? Well does intent count if you believe the collection of data is different from analyzing or directly reading it? However it is irrelevant to the topic at hand. Maybe [Clapper does believe so](URL regardless Wyden repeats his question. Clapper now understands and backpedals an explanation, &gt; ""Not wittingly. There are cases where there could inadvertently perhaps collect, but not.. not wittingly."" So, collection still takes place. Thanks for the information, Mr. Clapper. Unfortunately, we are now at this point in time where popular narratives are using [George Bush logic](URL to justify wide-spride surveillance. That logic that simply being affiliated with anyone foreign or the more rare exception, suspected of terrorism in regards national security. Or it could be the fallacious mindset that since Trump is a target of this, then it must be okay. It's a very fallacious contrarian argument.

Not only do these agencies fail but there is fear that data not involved with national security collected by the NSA can be used by other law enforcement agencies through the process of the [unconstitutional](URL [""Parallel Construction""](URL process. So, even if it all worked with no abuse and these agencies all cooperated and pursued these criminals, atleast innocent citizens data is masked, right? Even though citizens are [masked and that citizens and those in the US are targeted more than foreigners](URL the masked data can still be illegally or wrongfully unmasked. Take the case of were an intelligence contractor Dennis Montgomery, Larry Klayman, and others plaintiffs pursue a [lawsuit](URL against against Ex-FBI Director James Comey and other officials. He alleges that millions of Americans were illegally surveilled and unmasked, and that efforts were taken to cover it up. The meat and relevance of the case, &gt; Montgomery divulged to the FBI a pattern and practice of conducting illegal, unconstitutional surveillance against millions of Americans, including prominent Americans such as the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, other justices, 156 judges, prominent businessmen, and others such as Donald J. Trump, as well as Plaintiffs themselves, Montgomery and Klayman alleged in their suit. Plaintiffs were assured that the FBI, under Defendant Comey, would conduct a full investigation into the grave instances of illegal and unconstitutional activity set forth by Montgomery. However, the FBI, on Defendant Comeys orders, buried the FBIs investigation because the FBI itself is involved in an ongoing conspiracy to not only conduct the aforementioned illegal, unconstitutional surveillance, but to cover it up as well, the suit added. Klayman and Montgomery also alleged that they have evidence that they themselves have been improperly spied upon by U.S. intelligence. The suit named numerous other defendants as well, including current NSA Director Mike Rogers, former CIA Director John Brennan and even former President Barack Obama. There was further [elaboration](URL on an Alex Jones Show interview with Detective Mike Zullo, that worked under controversial Sheriff Joe Arpaio, explaining the where Montgomery's information, while a governent contractor, of the surveillance Project Dragnet Database originated and where it went.

It's worth it to sit through the video to collect relevant info. Now, I know you may roll your eyes but the point isn't who is targeted, it is how they are illegally targeted. From all that we know surveillance powers are expanded, abused, and can be politically targeting. Futhermore, we know Trump's assertion that illegal ""wiretaps"" exists is reasonable and true, and If more revelations occur or if the current case gets resolved we may even see Obama administration participation in this illegal surveillance activity and coverup. Now we get to the ""countering disinformation"" campaign that the elites in government and media are trying to start.

Podesta's account was on gmail. He wouldn't have a server to turn over. It would be google who would hand over relevant data and Podesta would turn over his devices. Remember back in February when the FBI announced they were charging 4 hackers from Russia with the Yahoo breach?: URL Well it turns out those hackers were also able to get into gmail accounts: URL Notice the National Security realm of the FBI was able to find the hackers and bring charges. Comey had his own counter-intel investigation and couldn't find any evidence or nail down the hackers. Only one of the people charged has been arrested in Canada. The rest are in Russia. One was jailed by Putin for cooperating with the US CIA. URL He isn't lying when he says his government had nothing to do with it. The Yahoo hackers were working out of a FBI cybercrime office in Moscow. They were supposed to be monitoring hackers yet they helped them. From the NYT: URL ""The criminal conduct at issue, carried out and otherwise facilitated by officers from an FSB unit that serves as the FBIs point of contact in Moscow on cybercrime matters, is beyond the pale."" I believe Podesta and Colin Powell (both on gmail) were part of the Yahoo breach the extent of which wasn't fully known until December 2016. Those hackers gave the emails to 3rd parties who then gave them to Wikileaks and D.C. Leaks. The hackers were working with the US govt. Why did the CIA want Podesta's emails out there and to stop Colin Powell from being able to endorse Hillary Clinton? Patriots in the intel community wanted to stop Hillary from getting to the WH. Re-watch Trump's speech to the CIA: URL He knows what's up. They know what's up. Someone in the CIA knew went rogue. Obama panics and blames Putin. The Yahoo data breach began in August 2013 (4 months after Brennan becomes head of CIA) and wasn't revealed until September 2016 and more in December 2016. Was Obama using Russian hackers to steal our data? Then framing them when someone in the CIA went rogue? Is that why he was so mad at Putin? He thought it was Putin orchestrating it when really it was his own people who sold him out? URL The CIA had identified the hackers. Read the entire article if you have time. So much cognitive dissonance. The CIA also admits the hack could have been made to look like it came from elsewhere. How convenient. This is why Trump says we will never really know who did what. The only carefully planted evidence was against the Trump team. OFA, DNC, Bernie, etc had their own battle over data having nothing to do with Trump. Seth Rich knew about the rigging and probably gave the emails to Uretsky. Uretsky may have leaked them to get back at Hillary for getting him fired. Uretsky's twitter account looks like it could be a fake but he retweets bad info on the Dems: URL Obama's ""database"" was cultivated by the CIA and laundered through the National Security Council. He stole data from everyone via Russian hackers who were supposed to help us fight cyber security. This is why everyone was so triggered when Trump tweeted we were going to work with Putin on cyber security. We tried that already and it failed. In conclusion, Russians DID hack but to HELP Obama. It backfired because someone in the CIA stole the Podesta and Colin Powell emails to help Trump get elected. Why? Because they had seen enough and knew if Hillary won the country was going to fall. Who is the CIA hero? Maybe it was someone in the CIA maybe someone outside government with ties. Flynn? "
5,cybercrime,The_Donald,Here it is..Muslim professor at ISU faked anti-muslim threats and attacks on himself to escape getting fired.

Provost Mike Licari indicated he has been immediately suspended from his teaching duties. The charges stem from a series of emails that were received on campus containing anti-Muslim messages and threats of potential violence against members of the Muslim community. The first report of the emails occurred on March 8, 2017. The messages specifically mentioned Hussain as a target. On March 24, Hussain reported an alleged assault in the College of Technology in which he was thrown to the floor. Hussain had been notified recently by Licari that he would not be reappointed to his faculty position beyond the 2017-18 academic year due to the inability to fulfill the conditions of his original appointment. Based upon the investigation, it is our belief that Hussain was trying to gain sympathy by becoming a victim of anti-Muslim threats which he had created himself, said Joseph Newport, chief of ISUs police department. It is extremely unfortunate that this situation caused undue concern on other members of the ISU community, said Newport, noting that campus crime alerts had been sent out following the first email and the alleged attack. Aiding the ISU Office of Public Safety in the investigation was the Cybercrime and Investigative Technologies Section of the Indiana State Police and the ISU Information Technologies Security Engineer. During the investigation, the ISU Police collaborated with the local FBI office and the Vigo County Prosecutors Office. The investigators were able to track the computers from which the emails originated and uncovered evidence to charge Hussain with sending the emails himself. I would like to thank the Indiana State Police Cyber Crimes Unit, the FBI and the Vigo County Prosecutors Office for their assistance in this investigation, said Newport. Licari indicated that dismissal proceedings against Hussain would be started in accordance with university policy. Arrangements are being made to cover his remaining classes and administer final exams."

A delegation of officials from the US met their counterparts in the Home Ministry last week and discussed ways to streamline the training programmes being conducted under the Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) pact. Indian police officers will undergo training programmes in the US training institutes on negotiations in hostage situations, terror crime scene investigations, besides on two new courses relating to cyber crime and maritime security. India and the US are working towards strengthening bilateral ties on security front, including training programmes. The US will be introducing two new courses for Indian police officers this year, a Home Ministry official said. Indian police officers currently can opt for six training programmes under the ATA pact. These courses have been an integral part of the bilateral cooperation on internal security between the two countries. India is a key strategic partner of the US in its war on terror and with groups like ISIS using Internet to reach out to potential recruits in India, the ATA courses are seen as extremely relevant, the official said. Currently the ATA courses include among others, investigating the dark web (IDW), hostage negotiation training, terrorist crime scene investigation. Around 120-150 police officers from Central police organisations and state police forces visit the US every year for training in these courses under the ATA. The number may go up to 200 this year with introduction of two new courses."

I think it has to do with Crowdstrike... let's dig pedes! ""The day after the media maelstrom, the reporters were back with less friendly questions: Had Alperovitch gotten his facts right? Was he certain Russia was behind the DNC hacks? The doubts were prompted by the appearance of a blogger claiming to be from Eastern Europe who called himself Guccifer 2.0. Guccifer said that the breach was his, not Russia's. ""DNC'S servers hacked by a lone hacker,"" he wrote in a blog post that included stolen files from the DNC. ""I guess CrowdStrike customers should think twice about company's competence,"" Guccifer wrote. ""Fuck CrowdStrike!!!!!!!!!"" Alperovitch initially thought that the leaks were standard espionage and that Guccifer's attacks on CrowdStrike were just a noisy reaction to being busted. ""I thought, Okay, they got really upset that they were caught,"" he said. But after documents from the DNC continued to leak, Alperovitch decided the situation was far worse than that. He concluded that the Russians wanted to use the leaked files to manipulate U. S. votersa first. ""It hit me that, holy crap, this is an influence operation. They're actually trying to inject themselves into the election,"" he said. ""I believe that we may very well wake up on the morning the day after the election and find statements from Russian adversaries saying, 'Do not trust the result.' "" As it turned out, many reporters found Guccifer's leaked documents too cumbersome to sift through, and some were nervous that files from the strange website might contain viruses. But on July 22, three days before the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, WikiLeaks dumped a massive cache of emails that had been stolen from the DNC. Unlike the leaks published by Guccifer, these were organized and easily searchable. Reporters soon found emails suggesting that the DNC leadership had favored Hillary Clinton in her primary race against Bernie Sanders, which led Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the DNC chair, along with three other officials, to resign. Days later, Alperovitch got a call from a Reuters reporter asking whether the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been hacked. CrowdStrike had, in fact, been working on a breach at the DCCC; once again, Alperovitch believed that Russia was responsible. Now, however, he suspected that only Fancy Bear was involved. A lawyer for the DCCC gave Alperovitch permission to confirm the leak and to name Russia as the suspected author. Dmitri Alperovitch knows a thing or two about what the Russians call ""active measures,"" in which propaganda is used to undermine a target country's political systems. He was born in 1980 in Moscow, in an era when people were afraid to discuss politics even inside their homes. His father, Michael, was a nuclear physicist who barely escaped being sent to Chernobyl as part of a rescue mission in 1986. Many of Michael's close friends and colleagues died of radiation poisoning within months of flying to the burning power plant. The takeaway for Dmitri was that ""life is cheap in the Soviet Union."" Michael also taught Dmitri to code. Without a computer at home, Dmitri practiced by writing down algorithms on paper. In 1990, his father was sent to Maryland as part of a nuclear-safety training program for scientists. Per Soviet custom, Dmitri stayed in the USSR to ensure that his parents didn't defect. He lived with his grandparents, and when his parents returned, after a year, they brought him his first computer, an IBM PC. To better understand his adversaries, Alperovitch posed as a Russian gangster on spam discussion forums, an experience he wrote up in a series of reports. One day he returned from lunch to a voice mail telling him to call the FBI immediately. He was terrified. ""I was not a citizen yet,"" he told me. As it happened, the bureau was interested in his work. The government was slowly waking up to the realization that the Internet was ripe for criminal exploitation: ""the great price of the digital age,"" in John Carlin's words. In 2004, the bureau was hacked by Joseph Colon, a disgruntled IT consultant who gained ""god-level"" access to FBI files. Colon was eventually indicted, but his attack showed the government how vulnerable it was to cybercrime. In 2005, Alperovitch flew to Pittsburgh to meet an FBI agent named Keith Mularski, who had been asked to lead an undercover operation against a vast Russian credit-card-theft syndicate. Mularski had no prior experience with the Internet; he relied on Alperovitch, whom he calls ""a good guy and a friend,"" to teach him how to get into the forum and speak the lingo. Mularski's sting operation took two years, but it ultimately brought about fifty-six arrests. More [sauce](URL "

No effort is made to improve the accuracy since this sets the final stage for the rigging of the election itself. _____ _____ ##Related Links: * Explainer: URL * Vote Skimming Explained: URL * Facebook Page: URL * Roger Stone discussing Dr. Davis and the app (video prompted, he discusses Poll Mole at 1:51:35): URL #DOWNLOAD THE APP HERE: URL"

13,cybercrime,The_Donald,Trump Policy Substance: China Trade Reform,2,477bfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/477bfa/trump_policy_substance_china_trade_reform/,2016-02-24 03:20:39,"**Reforming The U.S.-China Trade Relationship To Make America Great Again** ***How We Got Here: Washington Politicians Let China Off The Hook*** In January 2000, President Bill Clinton boldly promised Chinas inclusion in the World Trade Organization (WTO) is a good deal for America. Our products will gain better access to Chinas market, and every sector from agriculture, to telecommunications, to automobiles. But China gains no new market access to the United States. None of what President Clinton promised came true. Since China joined the WTO, Americans have witnessed the closure of more than 50,000 factories and the loss of tens of millions of jobs. It was *not* a good deal for America then and its a bad deal now. It is a typical example of how politicians in Washington have failed our country. *The most important component of our China policy is leadership and strength at the negotiating table.* We have been too afraid to protect and advance American interests and to challenge China to live up to its obligations. We need smart negotiators who will serve the interests of American workers  not Wall Street insiders that want to move U.S. manufacturing and investment offshore. ***The Goal Of The Trump Plan: Fighting For American Businesses And Workers*** America has always been a trading nation. Under the Trump administration trade will flourish. However, for free trade to bring prosperity to America, it must also be fair trade. Our goal is not protectionism but accountability. America fully opened its markets to China but China has not reciprocated. Its Great Wall of Protectionism uses unlawful tariff and non-tariff barriers to keep American companies out of China and to tilt the playing field in their favor. If you give American workers a level playing field, they will win. At its heart, *this plan is a negotiating strategy to bring fairness to our trade with China.* The results will be huge for American businesses and workers. Jobs and factories will stop moving offshore and instead stay here at home. The economy will boom. The steps outlined in this plan will make that a reality. When Donald J. Trump is president, China will be on notice that America is back in the global leadership business and that their days of currency manipulation and cheating are over. We will cut a better deal with China that helps American businesses and workers compete. **The Trump Plan Will Achieve The Following Goals:** 1. **Bring China to the bargaining table** by immediately declaring it a currency manipulator. 2. P**rotect American ingenuity and investment** by forcing China to uphold intellectual property laws and stop their unfair and unlawful practice of forcing U.S. companies to share proprietary technology with Chinese competitors as a condition of entry to Chinas market. 3. **Reclaim millions of American jobs and reviving American manufacturing** by putting *an end to Chinas illegal export subsidies and lax labor and environmental standards.* No more sweatshops or pollution havens stealing jobs from American workers. 4. **Strengthen our negotiating position** by* lowering our corporate tax rate* to keep American companies and jobs here at home, *attacking our debt and deficit* so China cannot use financial blackmail against us, and *bolstering the U.S. military presence* in the East and South China Seas to discourage Chinese adventurism. *** **Details of Donald J. Trumps US China Trade Plan:** ***Declare China A Currency Manipulator*** We need a president who will not succumb to the financial blackmail of a Communist dictatorship. President Obamas Treasury Department has repeatedly refused to brand China a currency manipulator  a move that would force China to stop these unfair practices or face tough countervailing duties that level the playing field. Economists estimate the Chinese yuan is undervalued by anywhere from 15% to 40%. This grossly undervalued yuan gives Chinese exporters a huge advantage while imposing the equivalent of a heavy tariff on U.S. exports to China. Such currency manipulation, in concert with Chinas other unfair practices, has resulted in chronic U.S. trade deficits, a severe weakening of the U.S. manufacturing base and the loss of tens of millions of American jobs. In a system of truly free trade and floating exchange rates like a Trump administration would support, America's massive trade deficit with China would not persist. *On day one of the Trump administration the U.S. Treasury Department will designate China as a currency manipulator.* This will begin a process that imposes appropriate countervailing duties on artificially cheap Chinese products, defends U.S. manufacturers and workers, and revitalizes job growth in America. We must stand up to Chinas blackmail and reject corporate Americas manipulation of our politicians. The U.S. Treasurys designation of China as a currency manipulator will force China to the negotiating table and open the door to a fair  and far better  trading relationship. ***End Chinas Intellectual Property Violations*** Chinas ongoing theft of intellectual property may be the greatest transfer of wealth in history. This theft costs the U.S. over $300 billion and millions of jobs each year. Chinas government ignores this rampant cybercrime and, in other cases, actively encourages or even sponsors it without any real consequences. Chinas cyber lawlessness threatens our prosperity, privacy and national security. *We will enforce stronger protections against Chinese hackers and counterfeit goods and our responses to Chinese theft will be swift, robust, and unequivocal.* The Chinese government also forces American companies like Boeing, GE, and Intel to transfer proprietary technologies to Chinese competitors as a condition of entry into the Chinese market. Such de facto intellectual property theft represents a brazen violation of WTO and international rules. Chinas forced technology transfer policy is absolutely ridiculous. Going forward, *we will adopt a zero tolerance policy on intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer.* If China wants to trade with America, they must agree to stop stealing and to play by the rules. ***Eliminate Chinas Illegal Export Subsidies And Other Unfair Advantages*** Chinese manufacturers and other exporters receive numerous illegal export subsidies from the Chinese government. These include - in direct contradiction to WTO rules - free or nearly free rent, utilities, raw materials, and many other services. Chinas state-run banks routinely extend loans these enterprises at below market rates or without the expectation they will be repaid. China even offers them illegal tax breaks or rebates as well as cash bonuses to stimulate exports. Chinas illegal export subsidies intentionally distorts international trade and damages other countries exports by giving Chinese companies an unfair advantage. From textile and steel mills in the Carolinas to the Gulf Coasts shrimp and fish industries to the Midwest manufacturing belt and Californias agribusiness, Chinas disregard for WTO rules hurt every corner of America. The U.S. Trade Representative recently filed yet another complaint with the WTO accusing China of cheating on our trade agreements by subsidizing its exports. The Trump administration will not wait for an international body to tell us what we already know. To gain negotiating leverage, we will pursue the WTO case and aggressively highlight and expose these subsidies. Chinas woeful lack of reasonable environmental and labor standards represent yet another form of unacceptable export subsidy. How can American manufacturers, who must meet very high standards, possibly compete with Chinese companies that care nothing about their workers or the environment? We will challenge China to join the 21 st Century when it comes to such standards. ***The Trump Plan Will Strengthen Our Negotiating Position*** As the worlds most important economy and consumer of goods, America must always negotiate trade agreements from strength. Branding China as a currency manipulator and exposing their unfair trade practices is not enough. In order to further strengthen our negotiating leverage, the Trump plan will: 1. **Lower the corporate tax rate to 15%** to unleash American ingenuity here at home and make us more globally competitive. This tax cut puts our rate 10 percentage points below China and 20 points below our current burdensome rate that pushes companies and jobs offshore. 2. **Attack our debt and deficit** by vigorously eliminating waste, fraud and abuse in the Federal government, ending redundant government programs, and growing the economy to increase tax revenues. Closing the deficit and reducing our debt will mean China cannot blackmail us with our own Treasury bonds. 3. **Strengthen the U.S. military and deploying it appropriately in the East and South China Seas.** These actions will discourage Chinese adventurism that imperils American interests in Asia and shows our strength as we begin renegotiating our trading relationship with China. A strong military presence will be a clear signal to China and other nations in Asia and around the world that America is back in the global leadership business. Source: URL"
