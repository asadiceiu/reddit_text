0,cybercrime,CryptoCurrencies,It's official: The COSS.io exchange is a scam!,1,hmxc58,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/hmxc58/its_official_the_cossio_exchange_is_a_scam/,2020-07-08 02:04:01,"Hello, everyone, I am a long time supporter of COSS.io (since 2017). I never had problems with the old exchange and could also make some money with the coin at this time. Since the change of leadership, however, things are going downhill. **TL;DR** &gt;\- I wanted to withdraw my coins from COSS exchange \- That didn't work out and I contacted the support \- The support want me to send 0.65ETH to my account to unlock my funds **Proof** &gt;\- [The PDF where they want me to send 0.65 ETH](URL \- [Chat with the support](URL \- [Chat with the Telegram admin](URL **Story** I have already written off my remaining COS Coins, but I forgot that I have another coin lying there. So I already tried to transfer this coin to my ledger in March. But without success, whereupon I opened a ticket. For a long time nothing came until I finally could give my deposit address. After I did that and it was again silent for a long time, I wrote the support directly on Telegram. They sent me a PDF, which says that I should send 0.65 ETH to my account to get my coins. If you look at the PDF and know the red flags, you can see immediately that it is a scam: \- Send us 0.65 ETH- You will then receive your coins- But you only have less than 20 minutes Of course I did not do that and wrote to the Telegram admin ""Satyarth | Don't send money"". (Yes, it really says DONT SEND MONEY in his name) Whereupon he confirms the whole story and also says that I should send 0.65 ETH. But since I don't have any more money to invest in crypto currency because of the current Corona situation, it's not a solution for me anyway. After I asked several times for an alternative solution (maybe just send my coins manually?) I don't get an answer from both parties and am ignored. Fortunately, I have a public prosecutor in my family with good connections to the BKA Cybercrime in Berlin. I have already sat down with her and collected all important information. I will now file this case with her help and I am curious to see how things will continue on this front. So my appeal to everyone: Avoid this exchange and if you still have coins there, get them out of there as soon as possible. Maybe someone has a good suggestion about what else I could do?"
1,cybercrime,CryptoCurrencies,What are AML/KYC for?,1,d96gkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/d96gkr/what_are_amlkyc_for/,2019-09-26 03:22:16,"The modern world is increasingly striving to remove anonymity from cryptocurrency circulation. Client identification is a big problem for blockchain companies today. The KYC / AML rules, offering their solution to the problem of identification, ensure the acceptance of cryptocurrencies in society, but on the other hand, they cause a conflict between users and regulators. SwapSpace explains what the contradiction consists of, what the terms are themselves, how to pass verification on the exchange with KYC / AML requirements and what exchangers stay anonymous. **Know your customer, (KYC)** is a term of banking and exchange regulation for financial institutions and bookmakers, as well as other companies working with private money, which means that they must identify the counterparty before conducting a transaction. Such practice prevents money laundering, terrorist financing, and tax evasion. The KYC implementation led to the gradual prohibition of servicing anonymous bank accounts. KYC procedures are created to help financial institutions better verify their customers and monitor transaction risks. Among them, the main ones can be distinguished:  customer identification procedures (obtaining passport data, birth certificate, etc.);  transaction tracking;  risk management (comparison of data on the quantity, the content of transfers, counterparties, material support, etc.). **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** is a more extensive term than firstly means anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing and counter-weapons of mass destruction financing. The AML process includes:  Monitoring of transactions worth more than $10.000;  A requirement to report certain types of transactions;  Control the movement of coins both abroad and within the country;  Obtaining KYC information to confirm a persons identity, and to check whether he was involved in illegal activities. These steps should help identify and seize illegal funds and prevent scam. **Similarities and differences** Often the terms are confused or used interchangeably, but its incorrect.  regulatory authorities will use the terms AML, viz. anti-money laundering and terrorist financing;  sellers of goods and services often refer to the term KYC commitment. Customer identification (KYC) is a component of the AML. You can call KYC a set of procedures and tools, a principle in the framework of the general AML policy. N.B.: the terms KYC and AML are primarily associated with the social responsibility of the business, with protection against fraud risks. Often they are found in contracts of companies from countries where there are legislative restrictions, state control over business entities. **AML/KYC in the crypto sphere** Blockchain technology has brought a problem to the financial sector. Most cryptocurrency transactions are made remotely and anonymously. Even though transactions in the traditional system are made open: the appearance and signature of the client can always be compared with the passport data. The advent of cryptocurrencies has expanded the market for financial instruments and brought the necessity of regulation. At first, cryptocurrency privacy policy was a distinctive feature, however, the necessary of transaction safety led to toughening requirements for personalization of users. The KYC and AML norms are also the main obstacle to crypto protection, as they contradict one of the fundamental ideas of the blockchain - anonymity. In other words, cryptocurrency transactions must be anonymous and inaccessible for tracking. But since regulators are preoccupied with the problem of cybercrime. Thats why now the verification requirement on cryptocurrency exchanges is becoming important. **AML/KYC at SwapSpace** There are no AML/KYC procedures on SwapSpace itself, we dont even have registration. However, we are an aggregator that integrates several swap services, some of them are completely anonymous, but others could ask an ID. We dont provide transactions on our own, F.e. Changelly uses AML/KYC. ChangeNOW doesn't require your data, but in particular cases, they could ask you to show your ID document scan or some extra information. You may exchange currencies at anonymous registration-free exchangers or choose the safest way if you think so. Our service provides both - just choose the most suitable way to exchange. &gt;*SwapSpace team is always ready for discussion.* *You can drop an email about your suggestions and questions to* [support@swapspace.co](mailto:support@swapspace.co) *Join our social networks:*[ Twitter](URL Medium](URL Facebook](URL *The best rates on* [URL"
2,cybercrime,CryptoCurrencies,The Real Price Of Data Breach,1,cq8kl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/cq8kl1/the_real_price_of_data_breach/,2019-08-14 21:50:03,"he rise in cybercrime puts companies under constant threat of hacking, data leakage, and other unpleasant incidents. In the worst case, a security breach can take an organization out of business; better when only losses are possible. If a company seeks to mitigate this risk, then how does it determine the actual cost of a security failure? Strategic security decisions should balance the cost, protection, and usability. However, estimating the cost of IT security risks is especially tricky as any digital business has many unknown variables and different accounts. In June 2018, a study of the cost of data loss from the Ponemon Instituteshowed that, on average, losses from major violations amount to $3.9 million. This is about $148 for one breach. Compare these results with the 2015 US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report, which lists various costs of cyber attacks on information, security incidents, breaches of confidentiality, and certain financial crimes such as phishing and skimming. Although the commission estimated total losses from cybercrime at $10 billion annually, it also found that the typical cost of breaching data confidentiality is less than $200,000. The difference is significant, but who is right? The last company that lost its business due to data breaches was Cardsystems, a high-risk payment processor. It happened almost 15 years ago. However, many companies suffered serious financial losses without losing business. For example, Home Depot still faces the consequences of data hacking in 2014. Two years ago the company agreed to pay banks an extra $27.25 million, in addition to the 179 million already spent, to deal with the effects of a hack. And when the Saudi Aramco brand was infected with Shamoon malware, it had to replace 30,000 systems. Usually, ROKKEX catches the eye of individual users talking about private cybersecurity. This time were striving to shed light on the losses the company incurs when experiencing a data breach. Why Companies Need Data? Lets understand why companies need tons of information. Before the introduction of digital transformation, the physical currency in the banks vault was the most valuable asset, and today the data is just as valuable as the assets in the banks (because data is money). Data serve as behavioral and predictive models, allowing companies to anticipate the actions of customers and, as a result, improve communication and prevent customer outflow. Collected data is the solution which helps to improve the effectiveness of advertising, for instance, in social networks. Data Is Priceless Today, the data is called the main asset, the digital business fuel. In the private and public sectors of the developed countries of the world, they are aware of this and are ready to invest in tools that will allow them to benefit and monetize the data collected. The Global Data Protection Index (GDPI) study found that 92% of respondents are aware of the potential value of information. Without exaggeration, personalization and data collection form the basis of internet technologies. But the value of the data raises the question of their security. To ensure it at the proper level is becoming more difficult. First, because the volume of information itself is proliferating: from 2016 to 2018, the growth was almost sevenfold  from 1.45 to 9.7 PB. Secondly, the cost of storing backup copies increases, and the management of infrastructure for protection becomes more complicated. As a result, there is a sharp lack of solutions that would correspond not only to current needs but also to future ones, for example, ones that would allow for a broader introduction of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the IoT. Thirdly, control overuse is being tightened. One of the most striking examples, which last year cheered up the IT industry, was the introduction of a GDPR. The study of GDPI claims that two of the three companies are not sure that their infrastructure and data protection processes comply with all regional regulations. At the same time, 12% of respondents who had failures and/or downtime, have already faced penalties for failing to ensure information security. Cyber Losses VS Other Company Losses The FTC claims that cyber-incidents cost companies only 0.4% of annual revenue, as well as part of losses from reduced retail sales (1.3%), online fraud (0.9%), general corruption rates, financial distortions and fraud with billing (5%). Quantifying the cost of hacking data is not an exact science. Start with direct post-impairment costs, such as consumer credit monitoring, fines, litigation costs, and prosecution costs. The cost of improving cybersecurity processes is an investment of first and foremost necessity. In addition, there are indirect costs, such as the cost of reputational damage, its impact on business growth, both in sales and in the ability to attract new talents and partners. Secondly, when investigating spending on hacking, it is essential to separate security incidents from data theft. The later is more devastating than hacks, as they often lead to direct malfunctions. Cybersecurity companies estimate the costs of data breaches by forming policies for different industry verticals. Technologies And Processes Elaboration of investment priorities is a strategic decision. Its not about how much a company should invest in security; the goal is to introduce technologies and processes that can reduce business risks. This is a never-ending job that should be conducted regularly around each line of the business and its changing needs. When developing a security strategy, financial indicators should be designed in terms of reducing operating expenses, performance evaluations, and current hazards. You should evaluate the security level of your company by your weakest link, which is mostly human factor (and that should be your priority investment). To mitigate costs, a significant portion of the security budget must go to employee training, covering topics such as defining phishing attempts, processing company data and defining social engineering attempts. This is the vision of ROKKEX CISO gained on the vast experience of working in cybersecurity companies. Businesses should always identify critical assets before developing security policies. The policy should include authorization based on strong authentication. Accounting technologies that indicate hazards during or after data hacking are vital. Measurements and monitoring are needed for security management; only they work with accurate event reports. A cybersecurity strategy must protect critical business assets, such as intellectual property, financial, and customer information. This will help the business ensure continuity after a failure. Encryption technologies are critical for transit, data storage, backup and recovery, and incident response. Multi-level protection combined with authorization, accounting, and authentication policies is designed to increase the cost of attack for cybercriminals. URL"

I am posting this on behalf of a fellow Redditor here who wishes to remain anonymous, and has worked hard to get us all these information. Will forward all well wishes to him. I am here to provide an update on the individual known as Jimmy Birer - this is how he calls himself in numerous online forums, per Reddit TOS I'll neither confirm or deny it's his real name - who owns the Reddit accounts /u/jbirer / /u/Roachzilla / /u/AlmightyJim. With major help of a few other Redditors here, we have gathered all the info on him via publicly available data and sent all the info with proof of his scamming and pedophilia (Some digging in forums and Discord servers that he was registered/part of revealed that he was a pedophile) to EGM (Security General Directorate) in Turkey (since foreign police departments kick the ball to Turkey's court) whom opened a police investigation on Jimmy Birer from the latest info they gave us. These claims have been sent to the police with proof of chatlogs, [archive.is](URL links, pictures. So all are solid, untampered evidence. I cannot reveal his personal info per Reddit rules but all the evidence I have has been sent to the police's cybercrime division via email ([siber@egm.gov.tr](mailto:siber@egm.gov.tr)), and a collection of them are also attached below. There are more information from the discord that contains pictures that directly links the person to the Bitreon scam, and the Coingeek conference he went to. Also he previously screwed with wrong people in a forum which ended up getting him doxed. So if you look hard enough, you'll find his info. Why am I sharing this info? He is developing this 'project': Bitreon. Its supposedly Patreon running with BCH but a few weeks ago he went silent and investors like /u/bitcoinhibby demanded a refund. He wrote ""HAHAHAHHAHA"" to Hibby. Not to mention him lying to others, saying that Hibby was a dev for Bitreon when in fact he wasnt. /u/bitcoinhibby shared all this in this post of his. Here are some proofs from his Discord. Do note that these do NOT include his personal info (Well these images at least) but include him confessing his actions. Where he links to his deed: [URL (Part of) his wallet from the scam: [URL Where he amuses himself about very criminal behavior: [URL Where he ponders about escape routes: [URL [URL Where he ponders about a bigger exit scam when people actually pour money into his tumbling service: [URL Where he admits to scamming: [URL [URL Where he wants to take his scam money and migrate to America: [URL [URL Where he complains about the failure of a (probably unrelated) scam: [URL [URL Where he apparently went to the Coingeek conference and scammed from folks there too: [URL [URL Random bragging: [URL Where he probably dabbled in CP: [URL Where he lays out the grand scheme of scam-and-CP: [URL We also have even more of his personally identifying info, including his face, from Facebook and other sources, but we cannot reveal in this post as it is against Reddit TOS. Since the original thread by hibby was posted, he appears to have collected another \~30 BCH from new Redditors. I will advise strongly against giving him any more money."
