1,cybercrime,Cyberpunk,Security Should Not be Sprayed but Baked,3,8wrlgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/8wrlgr/security_should_not_be_sprayed_but_baked/,2018-07-07 17:45:18," Recently I saw this fabulous quote **Security should not be sprayed but baked**. It kept me thinking of why this quote sounds so interesting and as they say A single sentence could form a whole story by itself. We are living in a world dominated by signals flowing rapidly beyond imagination. It becomes hard to control this flow or prevent others from accessing these signals. Organizations are facing new cyber threats each and every day, which is hiking as the day passes. According to the Ponemon Institutes 2017 State of Cybersecurity in Small &amp; Medium-Sized Businesses report, 61 percent of businesses experienced a cyber-attack in 2017, signifying a 6 percent increase from the previous years 55 percent. We have technologies, regulations, and standards to classify and protect our information along with Cyber Security experts, who could predict attacks even before that could happen. And still, we see different new risks arising each day. The cybersecurity community and major media have largely concurred on the prediction that cybercrime damages will cost the world $6 trillion annually by 2021, up from $3 trillion in 2015 (source: cybersecurityventures). This draws the biggest change of business assets in history, risks the incentives for innovation and investment, and will be more effective. This is where the quote comes in Security should not be just sprayed but baked . An organization or individual trying to protect themselves should ensure that security is not just sprayed across to create a belief that we are secure but instead security should be baked with the organization to be part of their daily activities. We see different organizations implementing security measures to make a belief that they are secure and their clients could rely on them to protect their data. And when an attack occurs, they shake with regret of not baking security. We should develop a mentality based on the quote **Trying to obtain perfection is better than pretending to be perfect**. We have all the solutions and technologies available to protect us from cyber-attacks and still we step back because of the cost and infrastructure in implementing the solution. This makes us develop a mentality to show that we are secure than actually trying to obtain perfection. All these are because of not realizing that we experience higher loss when a real threat forms and cause a high impact on the functioning of the organization or individual. So, who is there to blame. Is it the people who neglected to bake security? And if so what is the solution? What should you do? Its simple, just try to attain perfection. Realize that there are new solutions build each and every day to make your security, harder and better.  Or else you could also find a security consultant or a consulting company who could give you the best advice on achieving this. Spending money on security controls is just like creating walls in our home to protect for our family. Both aim to protect the important and ensure that even in our absence the people and resources inside remain safe \#cyber #war"
2,cybercrime,Cyberpunk,"The Science Tree, a cyberpunk story I read a decade ago of something that is truly happening nowadays (Translated with google from Spanish)",4,8chr6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/8chr6p/the_science_tree_a_cyberpunk_story_i_read_a/,2018-04-16 05:58:07,"Original name: El Arbol de la Vida Page 1 The science tree It was just under a minute before 8:00 p.m., Spanish time. Alex Vallejo, from Department of Computer Crimes, I waited impatiently in front of the computer, connected to a public chat server using the Nabi name. He and his companions they kept silent, in front of their respective terminals, concentrating for what They would have to do from now on. Finally, the computer clock synchronized with the World time marked 20:00. Fifteen seconds later, a computer appeared on his computer invitation for a private chat, from a user named Najash. Alex exchanged a look with Javier to indicate he was ready. Javier was his companion in the cybercrime section for 4 years, and was quite efficient in everything related to the hunting of computer criminals. Alex pressed the button to accept the invitation. Immediately a Chat window with Najash and Nabi as the only users. - ""Good evening, Nabi,"" was heard through the computer speakers, with a distorted voice - ""Who do I talk to, please,"" Alex said, as he made the signal to Javier so that Find out from which computer you were connecting. - ""Can not read, agent?"" - ""Your real name, please."" - ""With the nickname that I use has enough. If we are talking, I see that they have received the e-mail I sent them. "" Alex looked at a printed version of the mail. It contained details of the theft of a base of data from a bank that nobody, apart from the thief, could know. As well contained specific instructions along with a username -Nabi- and a password to connect to the public chat server they were using. - ""Alex, the bastard is connected from a machine in Singapore."" Said Javier, momentarily disconnecting the microphone so that Najash could not hear him. - ""Well, try to access that machine. You already know the procedure. "" - ""Did you do the theft that you were talking about in your e-mail?"" Alex said, returning to connect the microphone. - ""Yes, agent, although, I'm afraid, I'm not the typical pirate who would establish a connection to the police only to strut about their misdeeds. "" The amount of pirates who had contacted him for brag about his exploits. A failure caused by the pride and arrogance of many of them, and that had propitiated the capture of some. - ""Tell me, what do you want then, to prevent us from another robbery that thinks Do? ""said Alex. - ""First let's talk about the security of this conversation, I suppose that these Heights should know that I'm connected from a machine in Singapore. Said machine it is controlled by me, although its user does not know that I am using it to camouflage my Forward To reach you I pass through a cubic labyrinth formed by 216 pirated machines that run an antidetection system with different techniques each a. There is only one correct way to go through that labyrinth, and to be wrong in a Single step brings immediate detection. Of course, all these necessary measures They make the speed in receiving my voice and I suffer their delay, as you can appreciate, small, but annoying and inevitable. If you want to find out where I come from, Page 2 do it, but with great care, since at the slightest sign of intrusion the systems will skip, the connection will be lost, the hard drives of all those computers will will erase definitively, and you will be left without knowing the beautiful story that I am going to tell him. "" - ""Okay, keep talking,"" Alex said, ignoring the warning. - ""I have chosen you as a witness of the next thing that is going to happen."" - ""I understand, that's why the name of Nabi, who is a prophet in Hebrew. So important is what you plan to do that gives you biblical proportions? ""he said, while of his classmates he passed a note. - ""I see he has done his homework, agent, although I think he does not understand the magnitude of what happened, tell me, that bank branch of the case that you are carrying, have you said exactly what I stole from you? "" - ""A gigantic database on your clients, data of operations carried out of several million natural and legal persons, 18.7 terabytes of data. "" - ""It's more than a simple database, agent, it's the last piece that I I was missing to build my little puzzle, the Tree of the Science of Good and Evil. "" - ""Tree of Science? Another biblical term, and with your nick should be three, because Najash means serpent in Hebrew, right? "" - ""Very efficient, I appreciate your speed and that of your colleagues who they provide all the information they can get about me. "" - ""Thanks for the compliment, but let's focus on what you have come to tell us, okay?"" -""It's okay. Let's start at the beginning, this is not the first database I've stolen, although the last, for now. "" - ""Yes, of course."" Alex said, letting out a soft laugh. - ""I notice a little skeptical, agent. You, as the person in charge of the investigation of robbery in that bank, will have seen the signs that have betrayed my passage through the system. Have not they called you a little? You have experience in this type of things Have not you noticed anything strange? "" Yes, he had noticed something strange, Alex acknowledged. The traces left by pirates are usually quite subtle, especially to dare to steal nothing less than in the central computers of a bank. You have to be very careful, but the traces that had left were absurdly obvious compared to the level needed to be able access that level of security. It seems that it would have blown the alarms voluntarily once perpetrated the theft. - ""I did not notice anything weird."" Alex chose to lie. Pretend that he had not understood the clues he had left could anger him and make him make some mistake. The weakest point of these people, as I knew very well, was pride. - ""Do not lie to me, because that trick will not work for me. I know the cases in who has worked, your experience, I know you are a very intelligent person, someone Perfect to serve me as a prophet, Agent Alex. "" Alex suddenly felt a lump in his throat. Everyone exchanged glances stunned He raised his hand to keep the silence from breaking. - ""You're wrong, that's not my name."" Alex said. - ""As I was saying,"" Najash said, ignoring him, ""this is not the first base of data that I steal. In fact, I've been committing similar acts for 11 months. All databases of important companies, with data on their thousands or millions of customers. I had to be very stealthy not to warn all my victims, but with this last one I have allowed myself the luxury of leaving a business card. "" Page 3 -""Eleven months? It is impossible that you have managed to steal such amount of information in other cases without them realizing it. The large outflow would make skip any security system. "" - ""I understand your natural curiosity, but I prefer not to go into technical details Now, maybe they will discover it by themselves with time. Let's say I used pretty innovative strategies, given the success I've obtained. All databases that I have collected contain information about the lives of several hundred million of people, approximately 94% of the population of what is known, with Pretty hypocritical, like the First World. - ""And what are you going to do with such information? Are you going to force everyone to change your credit cards or something? "" Alex did not believe a single word of what This man said, however, was the robbery of the bank. - ""I'm going to force everyone to change their perception of reality, Alex."" - ""I repeat, I do not call myself that."" Alex was beginning to believe that this guy was crazy, but nevertheless I knew his name, which was worrisome. He doubted then if Javier would have turned off the microphone correctly when he spoke a moment ago. It may have been just a small mistake and this individual took advantage of it to make himself the mysterious - ""Leave it, Alex. Your databases have been in my possession for 4 months. I feel to make them look ridiculous in that way, but that's the way it is. I hope it comforts you to know that I have I've seen multinationals worse defended than you. "" The whole team began to prattle nervously, commenting on the impossible of the situation. Alex ordered silence. - ""But let's stop evading the main issue we're talking about, Alex. Do you know the automatic deduction systems? ""Najash said. -""Vaguely."" - ""They are a theory of mathematical research. An artificial intelligence that is able to reason deductively. Socrates is a man. All men are mortal, Socrates is mortal The same, but made by a computer program and much more complex, of course. "" - ""What does that have to do with what we are talking about?"" - ""Think, Alex. I have a total of 846 terabytes of databases. As you know, databases are made up of tables. These tables basically serve to establish simple relationships: card numbers with places of purchase, numbers passport with hotel reservations, addresses with the name of the person who lives there. Such information in isolation does not produce much value on its own. Crossing the tables is when you get interesting results. If one of them says that such a card number was used to buy gasoline at a certain station time of a certain day, another table tells me that the station is in Toulouse, and another It tells me that Mr. Smith is the owner of that card, we can deduce that Lord. Smith was in Toulouse on that day and at that time. "" - ""I know how relational databases work."" Something was wrong, Alex thought. Najash was not using the language of the hackers, full of jargon and technicalities. It seemed like he was giving a talk informative - ""Well, what I've done, Alex, has been to apply an automatic deduction system to the 67852 tables that I have obtained during all this time. "" -""What?"" - ""What you have heard. I've taken all those pretty data sets apparently harmless and by logical deductions and, I must admit, also probabilistic, I have reached certain conclusions quite productive. "" Page 4 - ""Let me be a little skeptical. First of all, how were you going to get storage for 846 terabytes of data so compromising without anyone find out? "" - ""My unbelieving prophet, I assure you that storage has not been a problem. He The world is very big and the Big Brothers do not cover the entire planet. "" - ""I still do not believe it, Najash, the computational expense to process such amount of Information must be huge. "" - ""Not if it is programmed with care. It took me 4 years to develop the system deductive. After that, 11 months of computing have been enough to obtain a succulent list of deductions. The database whose theft is investigating, in case he is interested to know, he has fed the last stage of my algorithm for 23 days. "" - ""Assuming you believe what type of information have you obtained with your program? A complete history of refueling vehicles? "" - ""Much more than that, Alex. Reasoning carefully can be deduced conclusions that apparently have nothing to do with the initial data. And not I mean, the initial data is not interesting. He would love to see the tables that I've gotten from the mobile phone companies, Alex. Gigantic files with data on the continuous geographical location of all its subscribers, thanks to the connections of its mobile terminals to the repeating antennas. All companies in which I have entered have a complete history of movements of each of their naive customers, and people think they have more freedom thanks to the mobile. Ironic, do not?"" - ""That kind of data is illegal, I do not think telephone companies have it."" - ""He is completely wrong, my naive policeman. These data are saved zealously by the companies to do their market studies and God knows what plus. Information is money, and you will not think of giant companies whose only purpose is the profit they were going to simply let those valuable data be erased, he does not believe? And that does not happen only with telephone companies. If we start talking, for example, of the large hypermarket multinationals, their files contain the eating habits of several million people. "" - ""You told me a nice dose of chatter, but you still have not told me anything about your results. "" - ""Do not worry, now I'll give you a little demonstration. I suppose that Find now with the members of your team. Is Javier Romero with you?"" - ""I do not know anyone with that name."" He could not have heard the name of Javier accidentally. Would it be true that he has managed to enter our system? thought. - ""As far as I know, it's the first time I have the pleasure of greeting a policeman homosexual. Hi, Javier. ""Najash said, ignoring Alex again. -""What are you saying?"" - ""Do not be offended. For me, sexual orientation is as banal as hair color. I just wanted to show you one of the conclusions of my program. "" - ""If you're so sure, tell me how you can have reached such a conclusion."" - ""I knew you would ask me, that's why I asked my program for the steps it took in this case. Many weekends Javier has taken money from ATMs in areas cataloged -informally, of course- from 'environment'. Also, and according to the data that I They offer their mobile phones, their terminal and that of a certain Andrs Guerrero come together in the same zone of ambience bars many weekends, and then move up the floor area of Javier or the floor of Andrs, in turn. There they remain all the night to later separate in the morning. The number of calls they make between They are also quite elevated, too much to be just friends. And that even Page 5 I've started talking about the pages you visit from your Internet connection apartment. Government security directives that bind providers of the Internet to save the browsing data of people have been the best fertilizer for my Tree, Alex. Have you seen how, from a few simple data and with the power of logic and the odds, can I come to very interesting conclusions? "" - ""Son of a bitch"", he only managed to mumble Javier. - ""To me my partner's private life does not give a shit,"" Alex said. dryly, with the intention that Najash stopped giving details about Javier, ""Also, I still do not believe you. Assuming that information was true, you could have obtained in many other ways. "" - ""And how do you think I know that you put the horns on your wife with Sonia Ugarte, what was your high school classmate? "" Alex paled immediately. For a few seconds it went blank. - ""I have never been unfaithful to my wife. Do you hear it? Never! ""He shouted into the microphone, but neither he himself believed what he had tried to sound convincing. - ""You're still a liar, Alex, if he does not behave, he's going to force me to reveal another great secret of his, worse than his periodic infidelities. You'll know what I I mean. "" - ""No, enough, please."" Alex sensed what he meant. If it was a bluff, I did not want check it - ""Not yet, Nabi, as he has been incredulous, I will give him a little more demonstration, but not about you, at least directly. Tell me, do you talk a lot with your neighbor, Mrs. Hernandez? ""continued Najash. - ""I do not know any neighbor of mine named like that."" He said. - ""I see that he does not talk much with the people in his apartment block to avoid to know even his last name. "", continued Najash,"" It is the neighbor of the 4th D, the next door to yours. Would you like to know what your sexual preferences are? "" -""Do not."" - ""Probably her husband either, because it meets their needs with Jorge, her 3A neighbor and 15 years younger than her. It's amazing how many people there are Amateur of sadomasochism, much more than you think. Would you also like to know how my program has reached that conclusion, or maybe how I have come to know What about Sonia and that other little secret of yours? "" - ""Enough already! Do you find it funny? Why have you made so many efforts to get all that information? What do you want it for? Do you want to organize a network of blackmail? "" - ""I've already told you, what I've done has been to compose a new Tree of the Science."" -""What do you mean by that?"" - ""The Tree of the Science of Good and Evil,"" explained Najash, ""is the tree that contained the apple with which Eve tempted Adam and caused his expulsions from Paradise."" - ""Yes, I know the Bible."" Said Alex. - ""Do not take me for a religious fanatic for taking the Bible as reference. Actually I am quite skeptical in any field that introduces the Fe variable, but I will ask you a question about its interpretation. Do you think, Alex, that when Adam and Eve tasted the apple and realized they were naked, Were they really expelled from paradise? "" - ""He says it in the Bible, right?"" Alex felt that he was not dominating the situation. A Short sound was heard through the computer, indicating that he had received an e-mail. He ignored it and kept listening. Page 6 - ""I think they were not expelled, at least physically, Alex. I think he made to realize his nakedness, to take full consciousness of reality, of what what they were, made paradise cease to be such for them. Said paradise was in its minds. Only an illusion, which vanished when they realized that they were only humans. There was no archangel with a flaming sword. There was only one traumatic and sudden contact with reality. I think I would have preferred the archangel. "" - ""Tell me what you propose."" - ""Alex, excuse me interrupting the talk, but I'm detecting attempts to intrusion on the Singapore machine, if not stop I'll cut the communication on 15 seconds."" - ""It's okay, it's okay"", said Alex, gesturing to the others to leave the machine from Singapore. After a few seconds of silence, Najash spoke again: - ""That's better, thank you. As I was saying, what I'm going to do, Alex, and you will be witness, is to teach all the inhabitants of the current Paradise, what we call First World, that the place where they live their naive lives is not as wonderful as they believe. I'm going to make them realize their nakedness in front of others. "" Alex quickly sensed what he was up to. -""What? Are you going to make the data public? You can not do that, the ... intimacy is a right of the people! "" - ""That right is as illusory as Paradise, Alex! When people are with the truth on the face, when your most intimate data are revealed to everyone, they will make contact with reality as supposedly Adam and Eve did, they will give mind that in the beautiful paradise in which they live is not so much, and that will wake them up his comfortable lethargy. "" - ""And what reality is the one you want them to see?"" Said Alex. I was starting to to get angry, and that did not benefit him at all. Since Najash talked about his secrets I felt that I was beginning to lose control. - ""The reality, Alex, is simple and well known to everyone. Known, but not assimilated. The mental paradise that we have formed has made us absolutely insensitive to what happens outside of it. Yes, Alex, I'm talking about people who are outside the Paradise. Do you know how many people have died in the Third World this month only in diseases that could easily be cured in the First World, Alex? It tastes like how much is quoted, emotionally speaking, a rich dead in front of a poor dead? Do you know the huge differences between poor countries and rich countries, right? Yes, We all know the situation. We see in the media the tragedies that plague the countries poor We know it, but we do not care at all. Yes, we can say it out loud some words of grief. We can donate some coins for some NGO. Maybe even sponsor a child, but those are ridiculous ways of complacency in comparison to the real situation. We live so well in our paradise that it costs us assimilate that that out there is something more than an image projected on a screen. Is the greatest wall of hypocrisy that man has ever raised. "" - ""So this is a kind of vindication for social justice, right? Do you think of truth that with that you will eliminate the inequalities in the planet? "" - ""I do not know if making Paradise disappear will contribute to diminishing the suffering of the poor countries, but at least, I will have eliminated a great abomination, with which I have I had to get up every morning for my whole life. I do it because it's what I want to do."" - ""So, because you're resentful of the world, you're going to pay by destroying the privacy of people? "" - ""That is a gross simplification, Nabi. Destroying the privacy of people, as you say, it is merely circumstantial. "" Page 7 - ""Do not do it, Najash, you do not know how people will react. Think about it, if you reveal So many secrets, so many intimate data, think about the chaos that you can generate, fights, maybe even murders. "" - ""One, a hundred or a million murders do not matter to me at all, Alex! This society in which I have lived has taught me to be impassive before the death of other human beings, only that I have learned to apply that impassivity also to the people of Paradise. The student has passed the teacher. Also, what you do not want Do it already done, Alex. Actually, I've started doing it before starting the conversation. The Tree is found by several servers in the world, easily accessible by the network, for about an hour. Several have been sent emails to all the press offices in the world with instructions to carry out the Queries to the Tree. You will be surprised to know the hobbies of the President of the States United, or the Prime Minister of France ... but do not worry, there's also information about their political rivals. No one is saved, Alex, nobody. "" - ""You know that all the intelligence agencies of the world will demolish your servers, no matter where they are. "" - ""You're wrong, Alex! This information is already public, and it's shared in many more sites every time. Internet users are already making massive copies of the Tree in the shared file networks. If people do not want that information be lost, no agency in the world can erase it permanently. And if you know the people, you will know that you will adore all that information. Do not tell me it's not an apple Juicy, Alex? In addition, my project is not summarized only in those servers, nor in the data of important people. Do you know the virus Eva? "" -""Yes."" - ""Ilstreme."", Said Najash. - ""It's a recent, apparently harmless, Trojan that is expanding quite by many computers. Currently it is the most circulating network. "", Alex explained grudgingly. - ""My creation, Alex, and not so inoffensive. The particular thing about the Eva virus is that it has a part of your encrypted code, and there is a specific date and time where that code will be decrypted and executed. That happened 23 minutes ago, Alex. All the infected computers are now following my orders. Create the virus, I must recognize it, it has cost me a lot of work, because if you had found out what your purpose would have cast my plan on the ground. "" - ""And what are the virus orders?"" - ""Simple. Using the address book of the infected computer, send all users that can a document with information about their people nearby that appear on the Tree. "" - ""My God, are you telling me that right now every person is receiving a mail with intimate information about the people around you? "" - ""Exactly, Alex. As you will see, I did not name her Eva on a whim. My Virus brings the apple of the Tree to all the inhabitants of Paradise. And how do you imagine, the temptation to bite is very strong. Everyone will read, like it or not what they are going namely. They will see the nakedness of others, and above all, they will also appreciate theirs own. If I'm not mistaken, I've heard a mail announcement before, maybe it's the one that's waiting, Alex. "" Alex opened the mail manager. I had received an email from a user named Eva, using an obviously false mail return. It contained a document, quite long, that started with an index of all his acquaintances and friends. Some names are not she recognized the naked eye, and she remembered her neighbor, Mrs. Hernandez. There was also Several links to pages where to consult the data of any other person. Before Page 8 to be able to continue reading, he forced himself to close the mail manager, although he did not delete the message. While doing this, Najash had continued talking. - ""I have allowed myself to add a small gift at the end of the document, in payment for the role you are taking in all this. It is a small fruit that I have removed from the Tree for everyone, and that only you have now. You can use it however you want. Y Now, I will say goodbye and I will disappear, so that you can record what happened. It will reproduce this message that you will surely have recorded, so that everyone understands the why of his nakedness, and I will help him. I hope you will, you will understand what is better, because right now important changes are taking place in the souls of many people. Can you feel it, right, Alex? "" Of course I could feel it, damn it, in the room the most uncomfortable silence reigned I had never suffered. His companions were at his side, but he did not dare to look at them, and intuited that they did not look at him either. Surely they had also received That damn mail with intimate data about him. His secrets, that nobody else knew apart from him, and now they were public domain. He barely got to grasp the immensity of what happened. If that madman did not exaggerate in the figures, what could be happening right now was indescribable. Delete all copies of that data would be nothing short of impossible, because everyone will want have access to them. A damn and appetizing apple, of course. - ""Goodbye."", With that laconic phrase Najash closed the connection. For several seconds none moved, no one said anything or the slightest sound was emitted. Sure enough, the whole conversation was recorded, and if he did not publish it, Najash would probably do it, in fact, he was sure it was already published (""I I will help, ""said the accursed one. Alex thought about giving the order to access the machine Singapore, but I knew that his hard drive would have been permanently erased. Najash had disappeared forever. He got up and looked out the window. Outside the cars circulated normally, leading people ignorant of what awaited them when they arrived at their house or work and consult your mail. Through the windows of the building opposite it was to a couple arguing heatedly. He thought about his wife and Sonia, and it was up to her computer. He took out a hard copy of the document Eva had sent him, and blocked the computer with password. Whatever it was that Najash had given him, I wanted it to remain just yours. I would see it later, but now I had to go home. He began to read the data about his wife as he left the room, thinking, with a bitter smile, that the best defense was a good attack. He did not look at any of his companions."

Everything I'd hoped for in a cyberpunk novel. It's got megacorporations, cybercrime police, cyberspace, hacking, body augmentation, concepts of AI, I loved it. I loved the world and the characters, especially the dynamic between Case and Molly, the whole thing with The Flatline, the alternate personality thing with Armitage and Corto, it was great. The way Gibson writes definitely immerses you in the world he's built. Although, I did have some problems with it. To be honest, it was kinda confusing and hard to read the first time through. Many of the terms he uses and the way he describes some things had me double take and read the chapter or paragraph through a few times to get what he was trying to depict. A lot of the time I didn't really know what was going on in terms of plot. One minute they're in Chiba City, the next they're in the Sprawl, then they're stealing a ROM from Sense/Net that does...something. Next thing you know, they're in Istanbul, picking up a guy for their team that does...something. Then they're in space with...Space Rastafarians? I didn't really get a lot of it reading through the book fresh. Hell, I still don't really know what The Villa Straylight was supposed to be or what the Tessier-Ashpools were supposed to do or who Linda Lee was supposed to be other than Case's Ex or what Riviera was there for. But all in all, now that I understand it, it's definitely one of the top ten books to read before you die. Now, on to Mona Lisa Overdrive. "
