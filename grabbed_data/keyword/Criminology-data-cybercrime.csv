(Australia),19,d661g0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Criminology/comments/d661g0/i_enrolled_in_a_bachelor_of_criminology_and/,2019-09-19 10:12:49,"Hey guys, about a week ago I posted here to ask about what it was like to study criminology and I got some great responses. I am now happy to say I have enrolled in a university course. It is 100% online (apart from exam attendance). This will benefit me greatly as I work full-time. I also have 10 years to complete the full degree, although I am looking to complete it within 3-4 years. This was a big decision for me to make, as it was only in April this year I graduated with a Bachelor of Business majoring in Human Resource Management. I've had some experience and I'm starting to realise that this career path isn't where I want to go. I truly believe that studying criminology and criminal justice will be my calling. I'm not exactly sure as of yet where I want to work, however I'm sure that will come as I go through my degree. Some of the subjects I will be studying include *Homicide*, *Fraud and Cybercrime*, *Counter-Terrorism Law* and *Rehabilitating Offenders* just to name a few. There are 24 subjects in total to complete, with 21 being part of the degree, and 3 electives from which I can freely choose what I wish to study. There are some subjects which I'm not keen on, but that comes with every degree e.g. *Statistics for Social Research, Social Science Research Methods.* I've never enjoyed statistics and mathematics and I am not very good at it. It starts late November. In order to gain full entry into the degree, I first need to complete two subjects with a pass grade. This is the entry requirement for people who have already graduated with an undergraduate degree. The other option was to use my GPA from my previous degree to gain entry however I thought it would be more useful to do the two subject method as they count towards the degree anyway. Overall I'm really excited to start and am really hopeful that I can make a great career out of criminology."

Thank you in advance. I'm currently getting my law degree in Germany (and plan to become a fully qualified German lawyer) and plan to pursue a masters degree in Criminology and/or Cybercrime. Maybe get a PhD in Law or Criminology too. The Question is - where do I find detailed resources on career options or what agencies are worth it to have a look at? Or what are other useful skills to have? (e.g. Languages etc.) &amp;#x200B;"

I've decided to write something about the dynamics of organised crime in cyberspace. The link between organised crime groups and the internet. But I'm kind of struggling with the subject. I found some information about 'organised groups' who commit acts of cybercrime. But can we consider them as organised crime? They do seem alike but they miss a crucial characteristic: hierarchy. Anyone got some more information about this subject? Perhaps some insight information :) or ideas? Thanks in advance!"
