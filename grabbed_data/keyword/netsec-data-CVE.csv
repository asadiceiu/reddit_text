The malware exploits a well-known Microsoft Office 2007 and 2010 vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158) and when executed appears to establish command and control (C2) with domains currently hosted on IP address 203.176.232.116. Pivot analysis on the C2 activity revealed additional technical indicators of compromise which can aid in detecting the malware on a victim network. **TECHNICAL DETAILS** In each identified targeted attempt, the actors leveraged an email account relevant to the intended victim. For example, in one case, the actors used a previously compromised email account of a retired Indian Air Marshall to contact a cleared contractor (CC) employee involved in Indian defense matters. The CCs network defenses identified the malicious attachment and analyzed its contents. In this example, technical analysis identified the C2 domain embedded within the malware, URL currently resolving to IP address 203.176.232.116. Pivoting from this IP/domain pairing revealed additional domains hosted by the IPall of which have been used in similar compilations of the malware as the callback domain. Aggregated together, there exists a pattern of activity demonstrated by these actors in targeting specific CC employees. **April 17, 2015** The malware executes a .tpm file and copies itself to C:\Documents and Settings\User\Application Data\mntat\mstmp.exe. The file mstmp.exe drops and extracts msids.dll from the encrypted .zip archive file msexw.zip, it drops the.dll loader msexc.exe and creates the MS shortcut file msexw.lnk to ensure persistence. The other instances of this malware demonstrated a similar execution, but employing different file names. The available indicators of compromise are attached to this document in order to aid in detecting such activity on a victim network. Indicators of Compromise: Based on multiple sources, DSS assesses that the attached indicators may be in use by APT actors targeting CCs and CC employees involved in Southeast Asian business and affairs. (See enclosed .csv file) As previously noted in DSS-CI-CTA-0013-15, CVE-2012-0158 along with six additional CVEs have been recommended to patch, as they are currently being exploited by known Chinese state-sponsored cyber operators and criminal actors According to FBI FLASH 00056-BC and JAR-15-00027, the use of these CVEs by state-sponsored cyber operators and other criminal actors has been discussed in open source reporting, including but not limited to, the reporting referenced in this document.
