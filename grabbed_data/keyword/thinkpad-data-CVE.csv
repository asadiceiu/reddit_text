0,CVE,thinkpad,T430 change keyboard question,1,i3mecy,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/i3mecy/t430_change_keyboard_question/,2020-08-05 02:24:20,Hello I would like to ask if its possible to switch my T430 keyboard for a new older style 45N2170 IBM type keyboard and configure it to work with linux at least without BIOS change ? I just enabled the camera in BIOS after 8 years thinking it did not have one. I have been looking at these sources The Definitive T430 Modding Guide [URL This implies can do the keyboard carefully without physically changing it but that it needs EC flash (is that a custom BIOS?) . I am currently on old 2.09 BIOS so vulnerable to CVE-2019-6171. Do I still need to use a custom BIOS for an older keyboard ? - Any views on hamishcoleman's github repo - would this be the easiest way to be able to use the older style keyboard ? It says it can be installed on BIOS up to 2.81 but not 2.82 or after. I am not sure the significance of EC vs BIOS but EC 1.13 seems included with BIOS 2.81 I don't want to use any different battery cpu etc today but may do so sometime. Thanks for any replies.

Yesterday I bought an usb-c hub for my thinkpad (L580), I just unpack and plugged in...""wow, it works"". And at this point everything is fine. Today I update the BIOS firmware and after the reboot the hub stop working, strange... First of all, I check what the update should do aaaaanndd nothing, just some CVE patched. Then I tried to reboot (doh?!?) but none signal. Tried to boot using Linux (just to check if the problem is Windows) but no. Tried to check if the port is fucked up but it works fine. I found out that if I plug the PD on the hub and then connect it to PC it works, but as the name ""hub"" should not need the PD plugged to work. I tried to make magic with bios and settings but nothing seems to work."
