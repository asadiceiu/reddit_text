0,CVE,oscp,Boothole Vulnerability,1,i54ij7,https://www.reddit.com/r/oscp/comments/i54ij7/boothole_vulnerability/,2020-08-07 11:17:18," Looking to this Boothole vulnerability, (CVE-2020-10713), since my RHEL7 server reveals to vulnerable, I have some queries, that I know the answers in bits and pieces but looking forward some advices: 1. My server has secured boot- disabled. So understand that already vulnerable to other boot loader defects? But how realistic such boot loader/grub related attacks are? Insider attack? 2. Now, if I want to enable secure boot options are there really critical CVEs against it so that I am defending against by enabling it? I want to experiment to know how easy/difficult to exploit. 3. Just turning on secure boot suffices on BIOS settings or need digital certificates etc for point number 2? Is there a procedure for it? Thank you very much for your suggestions."

I've reported over 300 security issues or bugs in an online businesses (Salesforce, Amazon, Mail.Ru, etc.) through Hackerone and Bugcrowd. I have made around $62,000 in last year ( I'm not trying to brag ) Anyway i have been pondering a more stable career in security as a result, because bug bounty is so hard to live off as in a primary income....... The caveat to me is i don't have a degree and I only have OSCP certification. I'm 20 years old but i just graduate high school. I have never worked professionally in any infosec, security or program field, but i know how to program, though, as I have create 3 DNS enumeration scripts and upload it in my github. One of my github repositories have over 1000 stars. I have responsibly disclosed a bug in jenkins and i have a CVE. My name is list on Sony, Apple and Jenkins Hall of Fame. I'm also a MVP researcher in HackerOne 2019 ( Q1-Q2 ). So can I use this experience to find a security job such as penetration tester ? I submit my resume to a lot of company through glassdoor and indeed, but i have got no response. Is there have any reason why this happen to me ? Is degree really that important ? I really want get out of bug bounties even I've had some great successes but bug bounty have no fixed amount. Did anyone who only had security experience or other experience with OSCP certification and got a job in the field?"

First i run an nmap scan and i can see the Apache server running on port 80. I then start up metasploit on Kali and run the ""apache\_mod\_isapi"" module which is supposed to result in DOS but i don't notice any change in the web server i feel like im so close and am hoping someone can point me in the right direction, heres a screenshot of the code execution and output in Kali URL"

I'm only a couple of hours into it, but I'm surprised by how realistic they tried to make it - a lot of things are run through terminal commands (which you have to memorize or use man pages for), the concepts of enumeration, portscanning, using the CVE db, etc. Of course, references to Kali, Armitage, Metasploit, etc as well. You go through a basic training of sorts learning some of these, with ongoing specialized training available, and engage in various missions to hack your way into various systems - apparently there's also a multiplayer component that lets you test your skills against other players as well. Has anyone else played this and have thoughts?"

I'm getting better at finding the vulns and getting a little faster but not optimistic about passing the exam in a couple of weeks. I've never met a box I couldn't pop in the lab but I'm pretty slow. I've started writing up my lab report with the Offsec template mashed together with the template that our pen test team at work uses. It's taken me some engine revving to get going on it but I'm starting to hit my rhythm with the lab report, although I wish it were going faster. I've been looking up CVE IDs and CVSS's (where possible - things like ""root's password is root"" don't have CVE's afaik). Our guys/gals at work do that and though it may not be strictly necessary to get the points, one of my objectives is to experience and understand what they are doing and what it takes. Also have a rhythm with the lab report should help me in the reporting part of the exam. I am finding that my note-taking habit (using Keepnote for notes and Shutter for screenshots, plus a directory for each box with ""loot"" and ""screenshots"" subdirs) has been pretty solid. So I promised in a previous that I would describe my workflow. Here it is in a nutshell. Initial housekeeping * Start up Keepnote on host Kali, add page under network branch for victim * Start Shutter on host Kali * Make subdir for victim on offsec Kali VM to store transcripts * Add loot and screenshots subdirs [Will take notes, copy transcripts with cut and paste, take screenshots throughout] * Revert * Nmap scan of all TCP ports and most UDP ports (using zenmap when I can) * Consult my accumulated list of usernames and passwords * Check every open port to validate what's on it. Nmap doesn't always identify it correctly * Start connecting, try logging in with easy passwords * Medusa, hydra * Any identified apps -- look up default passwords for the app * Any identified apps and OS -- searchsploit, google, CVEdetails, msfconsole search for vulns * Web apps-- browse around, try garbage in any input fields, try simple traversals Something will turn up. Once on system: * Run recon scripts, the ones mentioned by g0tm1lk and particularly my own custom scripts * cd around, anything interesting? Email etc. Microsoft systems have email buried in user profiles * More vuln searching as above Something will turn up. Once I have root: * run recon scripts again * tcpdump * what can I connect to outbound? Final housekeeping * back up host and guest desktops to external hard drive There's probably more and I'll edit as I think of things, but I need to get back to my lab report. I'm sure the more experienced among you have a better workflow. Maybe this will help jumpstart some folks who like me came into this without any hands-on pentesting experience. "
