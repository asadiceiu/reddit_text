For example, then Counterintelligence Division (CD) Assistant Director (AD) E.W. 'Bill' Priestap, who approved the case opening, told us that the combination of the FFG information and the FBI's ongoing cyber intrusion investigation of the July 2016 hacks of the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) emails, created a counterintelligence concern that the FBI was 'obligated' to investigate. Priestap stated that he considered whether the FBI should conduct defensive briefings for the Trump campaign but ultimately decided that providing such briefings created the risk that 'if someone on the campaign was engaged with the Russians, he/she would very likely change his/her tactics and/or otherwise seek to cover-up his/her activities, thereby preventing us from finding the truth.' We did not identify any Department or FBI policy that applied to this decision and therefore determined that the decision was a judgment call that Department and FBI policy leaves to the discretion of FBI officials. We also concluded that, under the AG Guidelines and the DIOG, the FBI had an authorized purpose when it opened Crossfire Hurricane to obtain information about, or protect against, a national security threat or federal crime, even though the investigation also had the potential to impact constitutionally protected activity."""
1,cyber crime,Keep_Track,Lost in the Sauce: Dec 22 - 28,1,ehmc59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/ehmc59/lost_in_the_sauce_dec_22_28/,2019-12-31 00:57:26," #Main Course ##Ukraine aid: The truth [The New York Times](URL published an in-depth look at what happened during the roughly three months that the aid to Ukraine was withheld, revealing new information that highlights how much evidence the administration has hidden (and is still hiding) from congressional investigators. The piece also underscores that Trump was involved in every decision every step of the way. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Russell T. Vought, the acting head of the Office of Management and Budget, Robert Blair, the senior adviser to Mulvaney, and Mark Paoletta, the budget office's top lawyer, were the key figures in executing Trumps pressure campaign on Ukraine. All three refused to comply with House impeachment investigation. &gt;Im just trying to tie up some loose ends, Mr. Mulvaney wrote. Did we ever find out about the money for Ukraine and whether we can hold it back? &gt;It was June 27, more than a week after Mr. Trump had first asked about putting a hold on security aid to Ukraine, an embattled American ally, and Mr. Mulvaney needed an answer. &gt;The aide, Robert B. Blair, replied that it would be possible, but not pretty. Expect Congress to become unhinged if the White House tried to countermand spending passed by the House and Senate, he wrote in a previously undisclosed email. And, he wrote, it might further fuel the narrative that Mr. Trump was pro-Russia. Not everyone was onboard: &gt;Pentagon officials, in the dark about the reason for the holdup, grew increasingly frustrated. Ms. McCusker, the powerful Pentagon budget official, notified the budget office that either $61 million of the money would have to be spent by Monday, Aug. 12 or it would be lost. The budget office saw her threat as a ploy to force release of the aid. &gt;At the White House, which had been looped into the dispute by the budget office, there was a growing consensus that officials could find a legal rationale for continuing the hold, but with the Monday deadline looming, it was a POTUS-level decision, one official said. Among those who disagreed with Trump: &gt;In late August, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper joined Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John R. Bolton, the national security adviser at the time, for a previously undisclosed Oval Office meeting with the president where they tried but failed to convince him that releasing the aid was in interests of the United States. &gt;...This is in Americas interest, Mr. Bolton argued, according to one official briefed on the gathering. &gt;This defense relationship, we have gotten some really good benefits from it, Mr. Esper added, noting that most of the money was being spent on military equipment made in the United States. &gt;Mr. Trump responded that he did not believe Mr. Zelenskys promises of reform. He emphasized his view that corruption remained endemic and repeated his position that European nations needed to do more for European defense. &gt;Ukraine is a corrupt country, the president said. We are pissing away our money. *This article is very detailed and important to read to understand the events surrounding the hold on the aid. Message me if you are stuck behind the paywall but would like to read it anyway. Here are some non-paywalled summaries: [Business Insider](URL [HuffPost](URL ###Promotion for stonewalling Last week, President Trump [gave](URL a big promotion to Mulvaney aide Robert Blair, just weeks after Blair refused to cooperate with a House subpoena for his testimony in the impeachment inquiry. As the above NYT piece describes, Blair played a key role in withholding the aid to Ukraine despite the pushback from top officials and legal risks. Blair [is now](URL the special representative for international telecommunications policy and will support the Administrations 5G efforts led by the Assistant to the President for Economy Policy, Larry Kudlow. In addition, Blair will continue to serve as Assistant to the President and the Senior Advisor to the Chief of Staff. ###Trumps July 25 Heidi Przybyla of NBC News [noted](URL an interesting detail from Trumps Twitter feed on July 25, 2019 - the day that he spoke to Ukrainian President Zelensky on the phone. That morning, [roughly an hour](URL before the phone call, Trump was reading a [Fox News poll](URL (or saw the poll on TV) that showed Biden with a commanding lead for the Democratic nomination. The poll also included a hypothetical match-up between Biden and Trump in which Biden was favored by 10 percentage points. Although circumstantial, this evidence provides insight into Trumps frame of mind at the time of the July 25 phone call. He had just read a poll showing that hed lose against Biden; he viewed Biden as a threat to his re-election. It was with this mindset that Trump pressured Zelensky to announce an investigation into Biden, effectively smearing his potential 2020 opponent. ###The impact on Ukraine NBC News [reports](URL that the delay in aid to Ukraine has worried top Ukrainian officials and has exposed the cracks in the Wests response to an emboldened Russia, inflicted permanent damage on Ukraine and heightened the risk of Moscow extending its influence in the country. &gt;U.S. support, in particular, is seen as essential in keeping what is widely seen as a bully in the East at bay. &gt;Just the presence of the American army on the territory of Ukraine, in my opinion, already scares the enemy  even without any other aid, said Ukraine Ground Forces Sgt. Maj. Yevhen Mokhtan, who works in this multinational training facility in western Ukraine. Volodymyr Yermolenko, a professor who runs Ukraine World, an English-language media project aimed at combating disinformation and fake news: The question about military aid to Ukraine is not about Ukraine; its about values. Its about shifting Western liberal democracy eastward. ##Putin and Trump call As has become routine, Americans [learned from the Kremlin](URL on Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with our president by phone earlier in the day. 24 hours later and the White House still has not acknowledged the call or provided a readout of what was discussed. The Kremlin released a readout immediately after the call, saying the two leaders discussed counter-terrorism efforts and ""matters of mutual interest. &gt;""Vladimir Putin thanked Donald Trump for the information shared via the special services that helped prevent terrorist acts in Russia,"" the Kremlin-provided statement said. ""Several matters of mutual interest were discussed. An agreement was made to continue bilateral cooperation in the fight against terrorism."" **Reminder:** This is a little out of date, but as of Oct. 4, 2019, Trump had privately spoken to Putin [at least 16 times](URL since his inauguration. The actual content of these conversations is often disputed and not recorded in any way. Two government watchdog organizations filed [a lawsuit](URL against Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for allowing Trump to [seize notes](URL from a meeting he had with Putin in 2017. ##Trump outs the whistleblower In an unprecedented step last week, the President of the United States put the alleged (and unsubstantiated) name of a federally-protected whistleblower out into the public. First, on Thursday, Trump [retweeted](URL a tweet sent by his re-election campaign (menacingly-named Trump War Room) containing an article that names the purported whistleblower. Then on Friday, in a late-night Twitter binge, Trump [retweeted](URL a post from a suspicious account with the name of the alleged whistleblower in the text of the tweet. In other words, Trump put the name of (who he believes is) the whistleblower on his official Twitter account, his main method of communication. According to [CNN](URL Twitter confirmed it has suspended some of the pro-Trump accounts that Trump had promoted Friday night. CNN also reported that the tweet containing the whistleblowers name was removed from Trumps account, but for many people (myself included), it is still visible on Trumps Twitter page. *I will not link to it because I do not believe in assisting Trumps effort to out the whistleblower, even if Trumps identification is not accurate.* ##Senate trial Congressional leaders are still stuck in a stalemate regarding the next steps in impeachment, as the Democrats call for a fair trial with witnesses and the Republicans lean towards a quick Senate trial with a predetermined result. ###Schumer Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sent a [letter](URL to all senators last Monday arguing that not only is witness testimony essential for a Senate trial - so is the need for the Senate to review documentary evidence. In addition to the four witnesses (John Bolton, OMB official Michael Duffey, and Mick Mulvaney and his senior adviser Robert Blair) [previously proposed](URL Schumer lists a range of documents from the White House, State Department, and Office of Management and Budget. The letter specifically notes the recent - partially redacted - [FOIA revelation](URL that the aid to Ukraine was frozen just 91 minutes after Trumps July 25 phone call with Zelensky. &gt;There simply is no good reason why evidence that is directly relevant to the conduct at issue in the Articles of Impeachment should be withheld from the Senate and the American people. Relevant documentary evidence currently in the possession of the Administration will augment the existing evidentiary record and will allow Senators to reach judgments informed by all of the available facts. To oppose the admission of this evidence would be to turn a willfully blind eye to the facts, and would clearly be at odds with the obligation of Senators to 'do impartial justice' according to the oath we will all take in the impeachment trial. **Further reading:** Supreme Court lawyer and former Acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal argues in [The Washington Post](URL that the FOIA email in which Duffey orders a hold on Ukraine aid is an important example of why witness testimony is necessary: So it wasnt enough for Duffey to order Defense Department officials to withhold the weapons from Ukraine. He needed to order them to withhold the legally required alert to Congress. And thats just what he did If theres any doubt about what the email meant, Duffey could clear it up by testifying. But he has dodged all attempts to do so. ###McConnell Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski told a [local news station](URL that she was disturbed to hear McConnell describe total coordination with the White House in planning and carrying out the Senates impeachment trial. However, Murkowski has given no other indication that she intends to break with McConnells approach. ###Graham A couple of weeks ago, Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham [invited](URL Rudy Giuliani to testify before the panel about his recent trip to Ukraine. Rudy, if you want to come and tell us what you found, I'll be glad to talk to you, Graham said in an interview on Face the Nation. However, it now seems that Graham is having [second thoughts](URL due to the realization that Giuliani may be trying to spread Russian propaganda: My advice to Giuliani would be to share what he got from Ukraine with the IC [intelligence community] to make sure its not Russia propaganda. Im very suspicious of what the Russians are up to all over the world. * During Giulianis trip to Ukraine, he met with numerous pro-Russia individuals, including one - Andriy Derkach - who attended a KGB school in Moscow. Derkach has been [identified](URL as a source (but not the only source) of the discredited claim that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, not Russia. * [Daily Beast](URL I wouldnt trust Rudy to represent me in a parking dispute so Id say avoid, one senior GOP Senate aide said when asked about any plans for a Ukraine briefing. ###Trumps defense Typically, in the Senate impeachment trial, the Presidents White House lawyers make up the defense lawyers. However, the [Wall Street Journal](URL reports that Trumps team may include House Republicans: &gt;The president has indicated that Mr. Cipollone would lead his legal defense team but is considering adding others with the television experience he values. Under consideration are Jay Sekulow, one of the presidents personal lawyers, and Alan Dershowitz, a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School and TV commentator, officials said. The White House is also considering adding some of the presidents staunchest defenders on the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees to the Senate trial team, according to a person familiar with the deliberations. Legal analyst [Ross Garber](URL notes that the impeachment managers (House Democrats that try the case) and Senate Democrats would likely object to such an arrangement: &gt;Curious that members of the Legislative Branch would formally represent the Executive, esp in a House v POTUS proceeding. Id expect an objection from managers/Senate Dems. (Informal advice is one thing, but acting as the Presidents - or Presidencys - lawyers is different.) ##Impeachment, Round Two? In a [court filing](URL last week, House Judiciary Committee attorneys argued that they urgently require Muellers grand jury materials and Don McGahns testimony for their continuing impeachment investigation: The Committees investigations did not cease with the Houses recent impeachment vote. House lawyers added that if the court rules quickly, the materials and testimony would be presented in the Senates trial. &gt;If McGahns testimony produces new evidence supporting the conclusion that President Trump committed impeachable offenses that are not covered by the Articles approved by the House, the Committee will proceed accordingly  including, if necessary, by considering whether to recommend new articles of impeachment. [page 12] The [two cases](URL will be heard by three-judge panels of the D.C. Appeals Court on Jan. 3; the McGahn panel is made up of Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson, Thomas B. Griffith, and Judith W. Rogers; the Mueller case will be heard by Judges Griffith, Rogers, and Neomi Rao. ###Dueling opinions Washington Post columnist Paul Waldman used the recent court filings [to argue](URL that Trump could be impeached for a second time: Dont dismiss it as an absurd idea just yet. Not only might it happen, but it also might be absolutely necessary. Waldman believes that between the possibility of discovering currently-unknown misdeeds Trump already committed and the possibility that Trump commits future crimes, a second impeachment might be all but inevitable. However, former SDNY prosecutor Elie Honig [threw cold water](URL on the idea that the Mueller materials and/or McGahns testimony could lead to another impeachment push: &gt; Legally, yes, theres nothing preventing the House from returning more Articles of Impeachment or impeaching again. But lets operate in the real world: theres just no way. No way it works politically, no way the public embraces it, no way Pelosi permits it. ##Giulianis interview In yet another freewheeling interview (over daytime Bloody Mary drinks), Giuliani told [New York Magazine](URL that if the Southern District of New York Attorneys office is investigating him, theyre idiots and assholes. &gt;If they think I committed a crime, theyre out of their minds, he said. Ive been doing this for 50 years. I know how not to commit crimes. And if they think Ive lost my integrity, maybe theyve lost theirs in their insanity over hating Trump with some of the things they did that I never wouldve tolerated when I was U.S. Attorney. Giuliani suggested the SDNY prosecutors are jealous of him. &gt;Its a terrible thing to say because it will get the Southern District all upset, but I know why theyre all upset, Giuliani said. Because theyve never done anything like me since me. They havent done an eight years like I did since I left being U.S. Attorney. Nothing close. Giuliani also addressed the allegations against his client, President Trump, and in the process admitted that it would be *in character* for Trump to withhold military aid dedicated to Ukraine: &gt;He didnt think it was such a big deal once he read about it [the freeze on aid], he said, because it was typical Trump; he withholds aid till the last minute until he makes them beg for it. And, finally, to top off the interview, Giuliani claimed that former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch is controlled by George Soros. Then the former NYC mayor launched into an extended anti-semitic diatribe: &gt;He put all four ambassadors there. And hes employing the FBI agents. I told him he sounded crazy, but he insisted he wasnt. &gt;Dont tell me Im anti-Semitic if I oppose him, he said. Soros is hardly a Jew. Im more of a Jew than Soros is. I probably know more about  he doesnt go to church, he doesnt go to religion  synagogue. He doesnt belong to a synagogue, he doesnt support Israel, hes an enemy of Israel. Hes elected eight anarchist DAs in the United States. Hes a horrible human being. * **Further reading:** Rudy Giuliani's anti-Soros tirade exposes three uncomfortable truths. [CNN](URL 12/24/19. And Rudy Giuliani Doubles Down On Anti-Semitic Attacks Against George Soros. [HuffPost](URL 12/24/19. #The Sides ##New CyberCom approach &gt;Military cyber officials are developing information warfare tactics that could be deployed against senior Russian officials and oligarchs if Moscow tries to interfere in the 2020 U.S. elections through hacking election systems or sowing widespread discord, according to current and former U.S. officials. &gt;One option being explored by U.S. Cyber Command would target senior leadership and Russian elites, though probably not President Vladimir Putin, which would be considered too provocative, said the current and former officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the issues sensitivity. The idea would be to show that the targets sensitive personal data could be hit if the interference did not stop, though officials declined to be more specific. &gt;...The intelligence community last month issued a classified update  a national intelligence estimate  asserting that Russias main goal in the 2020 campaign continues to be to sow discord. Its always been about exacerbating fault lines in our society, one senior U.S. official said. ([The Washington Post](URL or [non-paywalled option](URL ##Political ads The streaming service Spotify [announced](URL last week that pause political advertising in early 2020 because it does not have the resources to properly police the content of such ads. At this point in time, we do not yet have the necessary level of robustness in our process, systems and tools to responsibly validate and review this content, a representative of the company said. Reminder: Twitter has banned all ads from political candidates, officials, and political parties on its platform. Google has limited advertisers ability to micro-target users based on political affiliation. Meanwhile, Facebook has taken the opposite approach, allowing political ads on its platform without any fact-checking. According to the [Wall Street Journal](URL ([non-paywall](URL millionaire Facebook board member Peter Thiel was a driving force behind the decision not to crack down on political ads, despite some directors and executives arguing for limitations or a complete ban. Thiel is a supporter of Donald Trump; Thiel and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg [attended](URL an undisclosed dinner hosted by Trump at the White House in October. &gt;A major donor to Trumps campaign, Thiel is also the chairman of Palantir, a private data technology company that has become one of the largest recipients of government defense contracts with the United States government since Trump took office. ([NBC News](URL ##State wins and setbacks A win for voter rights in North Carolina: &gt;Republican attempts to require photo identification to vote in North Carolina are being thwarted again by judges hearing arguments that the mandate is tainted by bias that would deter black and Latino residents. &gt;A federal court announced that next week U.S. District Judge Loretta Biggs will formally block a photo ID requirement scheduled to begin in 2020. Unless the upcoming preliminary injunction is successfully appealed, the requirement will be halted until a lawsuit filed by the state NAACP and others is resolved. ([NBC News](URL And a setback for voter rights in Georgia: &gt;Georgia doesnt have to put almost 100,000 voters back on its rolls, a federal judge ruled Friday. &gt;The US district judge Steve C Jones ruled that a voting rights advocacy group founded by Democrat Stacey Abrams is improperly asking him to interpret state law. Jones also said the group hasnt proved that people who have been removed had their constitutional rights violated. &gt;However, Jones also ordered Georgias secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to do more to warn people that they had been removed. The judge is especially singling out a south-west Georgia state House district where a 28 January special election is scheduled. Voters there who have been removed have only until Monday to re-register.

McCabe sued the FBI and the Department of Justice after he was fired in March 2018 by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions just two days before he was set to retire. &gt;McCabe's attorney, Murad Hussain, filed a declaration on Tuesday claiming that several agencies and 30 individuals  including current FBI Director Chris Wray, Attorney General William Barr and Mr. Trump  have yet to hand over any materials requested as part of his lawsuit against his former employer.

Flynns sentencing is set for Jan. 28. ##Immigration news **Exodus of immigration judges:** &gt;Over the past year, in the heat of a border migration crisis, 45 judges have left, moved into new roles in the immigration court system -- which is run by the Justice Department -- or passed away, according to the department. That's nearly double the number who departed their posts in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, when 24 and 21 judges left, respectively, according to data provided by the judges union. &gt;The reasons why individual judges have moved on from their posts on the bench vary, but in interviews with judges who left in recent months, one theme ties them all together: frustration over a mounting number of policy changes that, they argue, chipped away at their authority...Their departures come as the Justice Department faces a backlog that exceeds 1 million cases.

Those protection payments aided and abetted terrorism by directly funding an al-Qaeda-backed Taliban insurgency that killed and injured thousands of Americans. &gt;...In addition to MTN [South African telecom firm], the complaint names the London-headquartered G4S Holdings International and its subsidiaries, the Palm Beach Gardens, Florida company Centerra Group, the Bethesda, Maryland company DAI Global, the Lenoir City, Tennessee firm Janus Global Operations, Overland Park, Kansas Black &amp; Veatch Special Projects and the Canadian company Louis Berger Group and its subsidiaries and affiliates.

What followed was an outpouring of cash from GEO: hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions to pro-Trump political groups and to his inauguration; and over $4 million in Washington lobbying, much of it directed at the Trump administration. For its part, the administration reversed Obamas policy and has dramatically boosted GEOs immigrant detention revenue. ([Project On Government Oversight](URL"

While undoubtedly, each of you have your own list of perceived inequities you consider most egregious, I am going to focus on just a couple that stood out in my mind and further led me to believe that the purpose of the investigation may have been good old-fashioned **damage control** (for the ""good of the country"" or perhaps something even more malicious). I would like to preface this by stating that this discussion is not focused on examining as to which kind of **constitutional crisis** may be worse for the Republic - having a **Manchurian candidate elected into executive office at full support and assistance of a hostile foreign power** or **lack of consensus on whether a sitting president can be charged with a federal crime**. I believe it's a very important discussion, however it's not the topic of this thread. Instead, I intend on highlighting key investigative discoveries and **somewhat dubious** conclusions drawn from them by SCO. ------------ **Issue #1. No criminal intent is found while the motif is prima facie.** &gt; To prove that a defendant acted knowledgeably and willfully, the government would have to show that the defendant had general knowledge his conduct was unlawful. Muellers team hypothesized that Trump Jr. could claim that he didnt believe that his actions broke the law. They suggested the same is true of Kushner. Investigators pointed out that Manafort is experienced in political campaigns, but added that they **didnt have the evidence to show that he actually knew the law.** IANAL, so please correct me if I am wrong, but I've never seen ""didn't know it was illegal"" defense used outside of the well-established **mentally incompetent to stand trial doctrine.** Based on already gathered evidence alone, [Trump attempted at least 10 times to interfere and obstruct the ongoing investigation](URL That's a conduct of a guilty person, someone void of **good will** to clear up his name. The motif is clear and Trump's conduct is the evidence of the **established and factual cover-up**, yet the SCO is hesitant to establish that Trump acted **""knowledgeably and willfully""**? Did he sleep walk through all of his obstruction attempts? Kushner graduated from New York University in 2007 with dual **JD/MBA degrees**. He **interned at Manhattan District Attorney** Robert Morgenthau's office, and at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP [\[Pillets, Jeff; Riley, Clint \(June 16, 2002\).

This is one of the most glaring and unprecedented examples of **continued Obstruction of Justice**, IMHO. They are new at this, give them a chance? They don't know what they are doing? When did alleged ignorance of law in face of facts to the opposite become a standing legal defense strategy used by a Federal prosecutor? ---------------------------------------------------- **Issue #2.

How is this not evidence of conspiracy and obstruction? _______________________________________________ Once again, these are just **precursory thoughts** on the SC's redacted Report published yesterday. I can't help but notice Mueller's hesitance in clear and factual assessment of Trump's established patterns of conspiracy and obstruction.

Combined with the 47-month sentence from Virginia, Manafort will spend a little under 7 years in jail (due to the 9 months he's already served), possibly less with good behavior. Judge Amy Berman Jackson's comments were strikingly different from those made by Judge Ellis the week prior: It is hard to overstate the number of lies and the amount of fraud and the amount of money involved, [she said](URL There is no question that this defendant knew better and he knew what he was doing. * Manafort also struck a different tone from his earlier sentencing, attempting to appear more remorseful for his crimes. ""I am sorry for what I have done and for all the activities that have gotten us here today,"" Manafort said. Judge Jackson didn't buy it, replying, ""Saying I'm sorry I got caught is not an inspiring plea for leniency."" * Throughout the trial, and especially in the final defense sentencing memo, Manafort brought up the 'no Russian collusion' refrain. Judge Jackson noticed and [called the defense out](URL saying: The no collusion refrain that runs through the entire defense memorandum is unrelated to matters at hand. The no collusion mantra is simply a non sequitur... The no collusion mantra is also not accurate, because the investigation is still ongoing. Further, the judge added the 'no collusion' assertions were ""just one more thing that's inconsistent with the notion of any genuine acceptance of responsibility."" * Immediately after sentencing, Manafort's attorney Kevin Downing [addressed the media](URL in front of the courthouse: For anyone who was in the courtroom today, what Im about to say will not be a surprise: Judge Jackson conceded that there was absolutely no evidence of any Russian collusion in this case."" Protestors outside yelled back, ""liar, that's not what she said."" Which is true, neither Judge Jackson nor Judge Ellis exonerated the Trump campaign of collusion. Both judges said the collusion question was not presented in Manafort's two trials; there was no decision or ruling either way. * After Manafort's first sentencing, Trump had also taken the judge's statement and twisted it inaccurately when [he tweeted](URL ""Both the Judge and the lawyer in the Paul Manafort case stated loudly and for the world to hear that there was NO COLLUSION with Russia. But the Witch Hunt Hoax continues as you now add these statements to House &amp; Senate Intelligence &amp; Senator Burr. So bad for our Country!"" * Also immediately after Manaforts sentencing, New York state charges against him were unsealed, revealing a Manhattan grand jury had indicted Manafort on 16 charges related to mortgage fraud and conspiracy. This will be further discussed in the Other Investigations section below. &amp;nbsp; **Trumps response.** After Manaforts sentencing, Trump was asked about the possibility of pardoning his former campaign manager. [His response](URL I have not even given it a thought as of this moment, Trump said. Its not something thats right now on my mind. I do feel badly for Paul Manafort, that I can tell you. The Daily Beast [reported](URL that in private conversations, Trump has praised Manafort for not being a rat or coward, as he views Cohen. Trump has also encouraged his advisers and legal team to publicly bash prosecutors treatment of Manafort. &amp;nbsp; **Manafort done?** So was that the last we see of Manafort in Mueller's probe? Not necessarily. Natasha Bertrand of the Atlantic [interviewed](URL former prosecutors who believe Mueller is likely to bring up Manafort again, potentially in additional charges for conspiracy with Russia. We know there is an important aspect of Manafort's crimes that hasn't been addressed yet, and we only know about it through a redaction mistake: Gates and Manafort's meeting with Konstantin Kilimnik to hand over internal polling data. This could come up again in an entire conspiracy charge or simply a line in Mueller's report. * Patrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor who specialized in organized crime: My money is on Mueller including the Manafort efforts as part of the case alleging Trump campaign collaboration with the Russians. The question then is, what is the best way to make that case? For myself, I believe a RICO [Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act] indictment would be the appropriate vehicle to bring such a case: charge the campaign as the racketeering enterprise and name Trump, Manafort and the rest of the gang as members of the enterprise  straight out of the mob prosecution playbook. * However: The former federal prosecutor Jeffrey Cramer agreed that Mueller could bring a conspiracy case and name Manafort and others as unindicted co-conspiratorsbut if the evidence doesnt rise to the level of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, it will likely just be outlined in the report. &amp;nbsp; #Mueller: Stone **Trial set.**Roger Stone appeared in court on Thursday to [set a trial date](URL November 5, 2019. Judge Amy Berman Jackson did not discuss Stones gag order and whether the re-release of his book may violate it. She stated she will take it under advisement, but did not give an indication of when we can expect a decision. Prosecutors updated the court on discovery progress, [saying](URL over nine terabytes of data have been turned over to Stone. * Other dates in Stones case [were set](URL defense motion to dismiss the trial due April 12, governments opposition due May 3, defense reply due May 17; defense motion to suppress evidence due May 10, government opposition due May 31, and defense reply due June 14. * While Judge Jackson did not decide on the gag order issue, she still [admonished](URL the defense for not telling her about the upcoming book because it would have been awkward: The last thing you should worry about is whether telling the court would be an uncomfortable experience There is no exception for awkward. &amp;nbsp; #Mueller: Other **Gates update.** Muellers office [informed the judge](URL in Rick Gates case that he is not yet ready to be sentenced because he is still cooperating in several ongoing investigations. For that reason, the next status report has been pushed back to no later than May 14th. As Trumps campaign deputy chairman in 2016, Gates is in a position to know about key issues such as possible Russian collusion, softening of Russian sanctions, inaugural spending, and more. Remember, Gates was reportedly present when Manafort met Konstantin Kilimnik to hand over internal polling data. &amp;nbsp; #RUSSIA NEWS **Russian Mar-a-Lago.** A Russian real estate investor wanted for tax fraud, Sergey Danilochkin, [appeared](URL in a YouTube video taken at Mar-a-Lago last year. Danilochkin fled Moscow in 2010 after being investigated in connection with the Magnitsky corruption scandal. Now, he lives in South Florida where he owns at least 50 residential properties. On the Mar-a-Lago video, he commented on how ""interesting"" it is that many Russian-speaking people were at the party. * Side note: Who else was at this same party, called the Safari Night fundraiser? Li Cindy Yang, the former owner the massage parlor that offered prostitution services to clients like Robert Kraft. Yangs second business involved selling Chinese clients access to President Trump and his advisers. One way she did this was by bringing them to Mar-a-Lago parties. &amp;nbsp; **Webzilla.** The Steele dossier reported that Webzilla, a company owned by Russian entrepreneur Aleksej Gubarev, used ""botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data and conduct altering operations against the Democratic Party leadership. Newly unsealed documents from Gubarev's lawsuit against Buzzfeed [provided more details](URL A report by a former F.B.I. cyberexpert suggests Russian agents used networks operated by Gubarev to start their hacking operation in 2016. The FBI expert did not go as far as the dossier, however; there is currently no evidence that Gubarev knowingly assisted the Russian hackers. **Cuts.** The Trump administration [is proposing](URL a 10% cut to the European Deterrence Initiative, which serves a critical function countering Russian aggression in Europe. The initiative supports American and allied operations, including troops in the Baltics. The fund thats designated to provide weapons to the Ukrainian military did not see its funding level altered, however. &amp;nbsp; **Sanctions.** Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska sued the U.S. Treasury Department and Secretary Steven Mnuchin last week in an effort to get the sanctions against him lifted. He argues the sanctions are based on unproven allegations and are unjustly harming his global business. [Bloomberg reported](URL In his complaint, the magnate said he is the latest victim of political infighting and ongoing reaction to Russias purported interference with the 2016 U.S. presidential election. * As NYT reporter Kenneth Vogel [pointed out](URL Deripaska's lawyer leaves a lot of room in the denial that his client was involved in the 2016 election interference. From the lawsuit: ""It appears to be the case that there is simply no evidence Deripaska is involved in the Russian Governments activities nor in any activity satisfying the criteria. &amp;nbsp; **Cyber review.** The head of US Cyber Command, Army General Paul Nakasone, [testified](URL before a House subcommittee that cyberattacks from Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran are growing more sophisticated. A Navy review released last week described several significant breaches of classified Navy systems and that massive amounts of national security data have been stolen. &amp;nbsp; **Threat assessment.** The Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service is releasing a [70-page report](URL on the threat of Russian intelligence services. Estonia warns that Russia will try to influence European parliamentary elections, set to begin in May, and will likely focus on larger EU states like Germany, France, and Italy. The goal will be to secure as many seats as possible for pro-Russian or eurosceptical political forces, according to the report. Russian intelligence will likely continue the cyberespionage campaign against the West while preparing for armed conflict with NATO. * The report notes that Putin continues to focus on Belarus: ""If anything unexpected should happen to President Alyaksandr Lukashenka personally or to his regime, there will be a great risk of swift military action by Russia to prevent Belarus from becoming a pro-Western democracy. &amp;nbsp; **Suspicious death.** The autopsy of former Russian press minister Mikhail Lesin was [released](URL last week. Lesin was found dead in a DC hotel room in 2015. Officials had ruled the death an accident, saying he died alone in his room due to drunken falls that resulted in blunt-force trauma to the head, neck, torso, upper and lower extremities. The newly released autopsy shows a curious finding, though: Lesin's hyoid bone, in the neck, was fractured ""at or near the time"" of death. * Last year, Buzzfeed News [reported](URL that Christopher Steele gave the FBI a report indicating Lesin was actually beaten to death by Putin's thugs. Buzzfeed: Three other people, acting independently from Steele, said they also told the FBI that Lesin had been bludgeoned to death by enforcers working for the same oligarch named by Steele. * It's important to note that Lesin died the day before he was meant to give an interview to the Department of Justice on the inner workings of RT - Russian state media. &amp;nbsp; #CONGRESS **Hush money probe.** The White House is [refusing to comply](URL with the House Oversight Committee's request to interview two individuals regarding Trump's failure to report the hush money payments as campaign expenditures. Rep. Cummings sought to interview former White House attorney Stefan Passantino and Trumps personal lawyer, Sheri Dillon, because they allegedly provided false information and ""evolving stories"" about the payments. * Rep. Cummings: ""The Committee is bending over backwards to act in good faith, but the White House has refused to produce a single piece of paper or a single witness to date."" * Stefan Passantino [was hired by](URL the Trump Organization after leaving the White House to ""handle inquiries from the Democrat-led House."" Though he plans to recuse himself from any issues that conflict with the duties he performed at the White House, the large amount of overlap between Trump's personal businesses and decisions made by the White House is likely to bring additional scrutiny to Passantino's role. &amp;nbsp; **Pardons.** Rep. Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, [said](URL the House is ""investigating reports that Trump and his legal team privately dangled pardons to obstruct investigations."" After making that statement, [CNN reported](URL that an attorney connected to Rudy Giuliani, Trump's lawyer, reassured Michael Cohen in a 2018 email that Cohen could ""sleep well tonight"" because he had ""friends in high places."" Cohen gave the email to Congress during his private testimony weeks ago. [Federal investigators requested these emails, see Other investigations section below] * CNN: But the attorney who wrote those emails, Robert Costello, told CNN that Cohen's interpretation of events is ""utter nonsense."" Costello said that Cohen asked him to raise the issue of a pardon with Giuliani. * The Daily Beast [reported](URL that Costello claimed he was referencing a song by music star Garth Brooks in an attempt to comfort a suicidal Cohen. * CNN: A source with knowledge of Cohen's thinking at the time disputes Costello's version of events and insists it was Costello who was pushing his relationship with Giuliani. Another source familiar with the emails said that Trump's legal team was trying to keep Cohen in the fold as a way to keep him quiet, hinting that a pardon could be in the mix at some point. &amp;nbsp; **Mueller report.** Rep. Adam Schiff, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, [said](URL he is open to calling Mueller to testify if the Justice Department ""either attempts to conceal the Mueller report or the underlying evidence."" &amp;nbsp; **Ivanka probe.** The House Judiciary Committee is taking a subtle approach to investigating Ivanka Trump - not directly asking her directly for documents, but instead asking other individuals for documents related to the president's daughter. The [NYT reported](URL that 52 of the 81 document requests included material related to Ivanka. For instance, Trump's longtime personal assistant Rhona Graff was asked about foreign governments providing gifts and money to Ivanka or her businesses. Former attorney general Jeff Sessions was asked for documents related to loans or investments from Russians directed to Ivanka. &amp;nbsp; **Whitaker returns**. Former acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker returned to congress last week to clarify the answers he gave at his first hearing. Rep. Jerrold Nadler [told the media](URL that Whitaker did not deny that he had spoken to Trump about the New York-based investigation into Trump and Cohen. Nadler also said Whitaker was involved in conversations about the possible firing of US attorneys. This means that its likely Trump told Whitaker he wanted an ally put in charge of SDNY and thus the case against Cohen. &amp;nbsp; **Simona.** On Monday, Simona Mangiante Papadopoulos testified privately before the Senate Intelligence Committee. She was [reportedly](URL asked about Joseph Mifsud - the London-based professor who employed both Simona and George. She told WaPo that more questions focused on her knowledge of Mifsud, rather than her husbands activities. &amp;nbsp; **Cohen perjury?** Rep. Elijah Cummings, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, stated the committee [will not](URL open a new investigation into Michael Cohen to determine if he again lied to Congress. However, Cummings kept open the possibility if new evidence of perjury emerges. &amp;nbsp; #OTHER INVESTIGATIONS **NY Manafort charges.** Just minutes after Manaforts sentencing wrapped up, New York prosecutors [unveiled](URL 16 criminal charges related to mortgage fraud and conspiracy. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. announced a grand jury decided there was enough evidence to [indict](URL Manafort of falsifying business records to illegally obtain millions of dollars as part of the yearlong mortgage fraud scam. If convicted on all counts, Manafort could potentially face 8 to 25 years in prison. The president does not have the ability to pardon such state crimes. * There is a significant amount of uncertainty around many of these charges, however, due to double jeopardy laws. It [appears](URL that up to 12 of the charges are for the same crimes and/or against the same victim (Lender #1) as Manafort was already convicted for at the federal level. This means that these charges can, possibly, be thrown out. While there are some exceptions to New York states double jeopardy rule, they do not seem to apply to Manaforts charges. So, this is why some have begun to argue that D.A. Vance should not have filed these charges and should drop them to preserve the legitimacy of the other charges that will still be enough to prevent Manaforts release in the case of a pardon. * For a more thorough breakdown, Jed Shugerman [wrote a great piece](URL for Slate. * Lets not forget, either, that the [hold out juror](URL in Manaforts Virginia trial managed to get 10 charges dropped charges which could be brought back at the state level. Specifically, the option remains for California and Illinois prosecutors to file bank fraud charges against Manafort. &amp;nbsp; **NY Trump probe.** New York Attorney General Letitia James [issued subpoenas](URL to two banks for records relating to major Trump organization projects and Trumps attempt to buy the Buffalo Bills. From Deutsche Bank, investigators requested loan applications, mortgages, and financing transactions related to the Trump International Hotel in Washington; the Trump National Doral outside Miami; and the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago. The subpoena also lists the financial statements Trump gave Deutsche Bank in 2014 when he planned to bid on the Bills. From Investor Bank, investigators asked for records related to the Trump Park Avenue project it backed. &amp;nbsp; **Pardon probe.** Federal prosecutors in the Manhattan US attorney's office [requested](URL Robert Costello's communications with Michael Cohen last week. This was in part prompted copies of the emails Cohen gave to Congress, which was reported by CNN last week. [see ""Congress"" section above] &amp;nbsp; **Malaysian funds?** The Justice Department is [investigating](URL whether a Malaysian fugitive donated $100,000 to a Trump re-election fund called Trump Victory. The fugitive, Low Taek Jho, aka Jho Low, is wanted in Malaysia for embezzling billions of dollars from a Malaysian state fund. He was indicted by the DOJ last year for conspiring to launder illegal proceeds and paying millions in bribes. * Jho Low has ties to many Trumpworld figures. He hired a legal team that included Chris Christie, a former New Jersey governor; Marc Kasowitz, one of Mr. Trumps lawyers; and Bobby Burchfield, who advised Mr. Trump on ethics matters. According to the Wall Street Journal, Jho Low also met with Erik Prince last year to discuss the case in Hong Kong. **Stormys lawyer.** The former attorney for Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, Keith Davidson, spoke to [ABC News](URL about the hush money payments and Michael Cohen. Davidson contradicted Trump's claim that he didn't violate campaign finance laws, saying the Access Hollywood tape went ""hand in hand"" with the hush money payments, which were ""done for political reasons."" Davidson also contradicted Cohen's claim, under oath, that he didn't want a position in the White House. &amp;nbsp; ------------------------------------------------------------- #Too long; didnt read section (as short as possible) &lt;To be added this morning&gt;"

[The Daily Beast](URL put together a list of all the times the media hyped an upcoming Mueller report that never appeared. Bottom line: Only Mueller knows. * The [AP put together](URL a great narative of ""the public Mueller report"" as revealed through court records. It really is worth a read. &amp;nbsp; #Mueller: Manafort **Pardon-proof.** New York District Attorney Vance [has assembled](URL a variety of criminal charges against Paul Manafort that are ready to be quickly filed if Trump decides to pardon him. These state crimes are likely to include evasion of NY taxes and violations of state laws requiring companies to keep accurate books and records. Vances office has been conscious of double jeopardy laws which make prosecuting pardoned individuals more difficult. &amp;nbsp; **Upcoming dates.** Paul Manafort is [scheduled](URL to be sentenced on March 8 in the Virginia case against him. Then, a week later, Manafort will be sentenced in the DC case on March 13. In just the Virginia case alone, Manafort is facing up to 24 years in prison, with prosecutors recommending a minimum of 19.5 years. &amp;nbsp; #Mueller: Stone **Crosshair incident.** Last Monday, Roger Stone [posted a picture](URL on Instagram of the judge presiding over his case, Amy Berman Jackson, with crosshairs beside her head. The text accompanying the image read in part: Through legal trickery Deep State hitman Robert Mueller had guaranteed that my upcoming show trial is before Judge Amy Berman Jackson, an Obama appointed Judge who dismissed the Benghazi charges against Hillary Clinton and incarcerated Paul Manafort prior to his conviction for any crime. After widespread media attention for what has been perceived as an attack on a federal judge, Stone deleted the post and filed a notice of apology with the court. &amp;nbsp; **Crosshair hearing.** In response to Roger Stones Instagram post, Judge Jackson [ordered him](URL to appear before the court on Thursday. Stones lawyers called the decision to put the image on his account indefensible, but ensured the judge that Stone had learned his lesson. Deciding that Stone ""couldn't keep his story straight on the stand, Jackson increased the scope of the gag order against him; he cannot speak publicly about the case or its participants except to raise funds for his defense and maintain his innocence. * To explain his actions, Stone took the stand. He said he didnt think they were crosshairs on the photo and said he was hurtfully sorry for [his] own stupidity. However, Stone claimed he couldnt remember who selected the image or even the names of all five or six of the volunteers who work for him. * Jackson warned Stone this was his last chance and failure to abide by her order will result in jail until trial. This is not baseball, she said. There will be no third chance. If you cannot abide by this, I will be forced to change your surroundings so you have no temptations. &amp;nbsp; #Mueller: Other **Nuclear deal.** Numerous whistleblowers [came forward](URL to report that top Trump officials have continued to pursue a plan, originally spearheaded by Michael Flynn, to supply Saudi Arabia with nuclear power plants. Despite warnings and objections from experts, White House lawyers, and National Security Council (NSC) officials, the Trump administration has persisted. In fact, just two weeks ago Energy Secretary Rick Perry, NSC, and State Department representatives met with a dozen nuclear industry executives to discuss the deal. This meeting was reportedly organized by the same company that collaborated with Flynn. * [Additionally](URL one of the nuclear companies, Westinghouse Electric, is owned by a firm that also bought a stake in a troubled Manhattan skyscraper owned by Jared Kushners family company. The owner, Brookfield Business Partners, is funded in part by the Qatari Investment Authority (which is believed by many to be the mystery company fighting against Muellers grand jury subpoena). Kushner is about to depart on a tour of the Middle East ending in Saudi Arabia where he is set to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman again. * The House Oversight Committee and House Intelligence Committee pledged to investigate these proposed deals. A report detailing the whistleblowers accounts stated: Multiple whistleblowers came forward to warn about efforts inside the White House to rush the transfer of highly sensitive U.S. nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia in potential violation of federal law. &amp;nbsp; **McCabe interviewed.** Former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe [confirmed](URL that he has been interview by Mueller. Appearing on The View, he said: The information I have, including the memos that I wrote, Ive given all that to the special counsel team. * In a different media appearance last week, [McCabe said](URL its possible Trump is a Russian asset. I think that's why we started our investigation, and I'm really anxious to see where (special counsel Robert) Mueller concludes that,"" he added. &amp;nbsp; #FOREIGN INTERFERENCE **2020.** According to data reviewed by [Politico](URL a wide-ranging and ongoing disinformation campaign targeting Democratic 2020 front-runners is already underway. While the main drive of the propaganda appears to be undermining candidates like Harris, Warren, Sanders, and ORourke, many of the social media posts are divisive and attempt to sow discord and chaos within the Democratic party in general. Analysts have noted similarities to the 2016 efforts by Russias Internet Research Agency and to the efforts to influence the 2018 midterms. A state actor is most likely behind the coordinated propaganda, but so far no one has been able to conclusively say whether it is Russia, North Korea, Iran, China, or another adversary. * An analyst who has been studying the evolution of these disinformation campaigns noted that the tactics being employed now are more sophisticated than those that began in 2016. Politico: Some of the accounts are believed to be highly sophisticated synthetic accounts operated by people attempting to influence conversations, while others are coordinated in some way by actors who have identified real individuals already tweeting out a desired message. Tens of thousands of other accounts then work in concert to amplify the core group through mentions and retweets to drive what appears, on the surface, to be organic virality. &amp;nbsp; **More hacking.** Last week, Microsoft [announced](URL the detection of another hacking attempt of think-tanks that have been critical of Putin and the Kremlin. Over 100 accounts were targeted belonging to employees of the German Council on Foreign Relations, the German Marshall Fund, and the Aspen Institute affiliates in Europe. According to Microsoft, the perpetrators were the Russian GRU unit known as Fancy Bear, which was also behind the 2016 DNC spear phishing attacks. * This is the second cyber attack on think tanks in the past six months. Last August, Microsoft [reported](URL Russian hackers targeted two American think tanks and US Senators. The common element among the victims, again, was criticism of Russia. &amp;nbsp; **Pledging.** Every 2020 candidate has [pledged](URL not to knowingly use hacked or stolen material during the campaign except Trump. According to The Daily Beast, the Trump campaign's national press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, said: Were not in the business of taking pledges invented by the liberal online media."" &amp;nbsp; #RUSSIA NEWS **Missile threats.** Last Wednesday, Vladimir Putin gave a state-of-the-union speech to Russia, [during which](URL he made some of his most explicit threats ever. Following Trumps decision to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, Putin blamed to US for starting an arms race and threatened to aim weapons at the US if American missiles are placed in Europe. He said, Let them [the ruling class in the US] first calculate the range and speed of our advanced weapons systems, and then make decisions on the threats against our country. Despite Trump pulling out of the INF treaty, Putin didnt criticize him; instead, Putin blamed a secret deep state for holding Trump back and working against him. * The [INF treaty](URL ""prohibited land-based cruise or ballistic missiles with ranges between 311 miles and 3,420 miles. It did not cover air- or sea-launched weapons."" In 2014, the Obama administration ""accused Russia of violating the treaty by deploying prohibited tactical nuclear weapons designed to intimidate Europe and the former Soviet states that have aligned with the West."" Russian officials maintain there is and has been no violation. But, ""American officials say Moscow is all but openly deploying a prohibited missile that the West calls the SSC-8, a land-based cruise missile that could be threatening to European nations."" &amp;nbsp; **RU treason.** The prosecution of a former FSB cybersecurity officer and a Kaspersky Lab manager accused of treason has slowly been moving forward since their arrest shortly after the 2016 election. Russian officials allege the two men were compromised by US intelligence and [ask for](URL 20 years in prison when they are sentenced Feb. 26. There have been suggestions that their arrests were linked to Russian interference in the 2016 election, but the Kremlin denies the allegation. Some have also questioned whether the arrested individuals were anonymous sources in the Steele dossier. &amp;nbsp; **Italian meddling.** An Italian media outlet [reported](URL that a leader of the far right party made a deal with the Kremlin for 3 million Euro payments to his political campaign, disguised as normal sales. Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, of the Lega Nord party and self-proclaimed fan of Trump, made a trip to Moscow in October last year. After ditching the Italian press pool, disappearing for the night, and reappearing the next day, it was discovered that he actually met with Putin ally Deputy Premier Dmitry Kozak. * This story is included here because of the parallels with the alleged Trump-Russia collusion. It also adds to evidence of Putins meddling in the politics of Western nations. For instance, in France, far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen [received](URL a $12.2 million loan from a Russian bank. In Britain, Brexit financier Aaron Banks [was offered](URL at least three potentially lucrative business opportunities in Russian-owner gold or diamond mines. &amp;nbsp; #CONGRESS House **Cohen update.** Michael Cohen is [set to testify](URL this Wednesday, Feb. 27, before the House Oversight Committee in a public hearing (at 10 am eastern). The announcement came just hours after a federal judge agreed to delay Cohens deadline to report to jail by 60 days; he is now required to surrender on May 6. * While Cohen will not talk about any Russia-related matters in public session, Cohen will [reportedly](URL answer questions regarding: Trump's debts and payments related to efforts to influence the 2016 election, compliance with financial disclosure requirements and campaign finance and tax laws, possible conflicts of interests, business practices, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., the accuracy of the president's public statements, the Trump Foundation, and Cohen's allegations that Trump has tried to intimidate Cohen by threatening him and his family. * The next day, Feb. 28, Cohen [will give](URL testimony to the House Intelligence Committee in a closed-door session. &amp;nbsp; **NRA probe.** Reps. Ted Lieu and Kathleen Rice [announced](URL an investigation into the NRAs ties to the Kremlin. In a letter to the NRA, they said they are disturbed by the lack of transparency the organization had demonstrated and suggested NRA officials are covering up evidence of the full extent of its relationship to Russia. As ABC News summed up, Lieu and Rice ultimately questioned whether the Kremlin might have used the NRA to funnel foreign money into the U.S. election system. * The trip in question took place in 2015 when a high profile party of NRA and conservative members met with senior Kremlin officials in Moscow. The attendants included: former NRA president David Keene, future NRA president Pete Brownell, NRA fundraiser Joe Gregory, NRA benefactor Dr. Arnold Goldschlager and his daughter Hilary, Outdoor Channel CEO Jim Liberatore, and prominent NRA advocate and Trump campaign surrogate David Clarke. At the end of January 2019, after the trip received intense media attention, the NRAs outside counsel tried to downplay the NRAs official role, saying CEO Wayne LaPierre was opposed to the trip and didnt want staff members to participate. * Based on emails sent by NRA officials, ABC News [reported](URL that the organization was more involved in planning and financing the trip than they portrayed. * For instance, ABC states emails suggest that the NRA would pay for travel expenses for two delegation members and provide formal NRA gifts for the delegation to present to their Russian hosts Further, a Facebook post tagging Butina, Clarke and Liberatore said: The delegation of the worlds largest social organization for supporters of weapons, the National Rifle Association USA (The NRA) made an official visit to Moscow and met with supporters of the movement, Right to Arms. &amp;nbsp; **Nunes the mole?** The Atlantics Natasha Bertrand conducted an [interview](URL with former Deputy Director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe. She tweeted a key statement that was cut from the printed interview: that McCabe believes Rep. Devin Nunes was (is?) acting as mole for Trump. McCabe reportedly said that when he presented his decision to open an investigation into Trump (after the Comey firing) to the Gang of Eight, Nunes very quickly informed the White House of the investigation. Nunes attended the meeting because he was the Chairman of the House Intelligence Cmte. at the time. * Bertrands tweets: [\[1\]](URL We had to cut this for length, but McCabe told me that his guess is that the White House ""immediately knew the steps I took after Jim got fired, and the cases I opened"" because of Nunes. ""When I was surprised to see Nunes at the briefing, I knew it would happen very quickly."" [\[2\]](URL And here is what McCabe says about this in the book: ""Now that the Gang of Eight was a crowd of two dozen in the room, I thought, the chance of this not getting back to the president was basically zero. Then Devin Nunes walked in, and the chance was less than zero."" * McCabes suspicions are supported by Nunes past behavior. For example, the House Ethics Committee [investigated](URL him in 2017 for making unauthorized disclosures of classified information during a press conference where he announced that intelligence agencies incidentally collected information about associates of President Trump. Despite Nunes claims that the committee completely cleared him, [insiders stated](URL the panel was never able to obtain or review the classified information at the heart of the inquiry, leading to the closure of the investigation. In another breach, Nunes [allegedly leaked](URL Sen. Mark Warners text messages to Fox News, according to a complaint by watchdog Campaign for Accountability. &amp;nbsp; #Senate **1990s Moscow.** The Senate Intelligence Committee [has been](URL interviewing witnesses about Trumps ties to American businessman, based in Moscow, David Geovanis. In the late 1990s, Trump was attempting to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, even going as far as to personally visit the proposed site himself. Geovanis organized the 1996 trip and showed him around Moscow, making introductions to key Russian officials. More recently, Geovanis worked for Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. * One of the witnesses gave the Senate written testimony alleging that Geovanis may be key to the question of Russian kompromat (blackmail) on Trump. Two other witnesses told CNN the Senate showed them a picture of Geovanis with three scantily clad women posed in front of a portrait of Joseph Stalin. Its unclear why the Senate has this photo or why it may be important. &amp;nbsp; **Cohen update.** On Tuesday, Feb. 26, Cohen is [set to testify](URL before the Senate Intelligence Committee in a closed-door session. &amp;nbsp; #DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE **New info.** Last month, Michael Cohen [gave](URL Manhattan federal prosecutors more information on possible irregularities within the presidents family business and about a donor to the inaugural committee. The donor is reportedly Imaad Zuberi, who gave $900,000 to Trumps inaugural committee and wrote Cohen a substantial check after trying to hire him. A possible motivation for Cohen here is to build goodwill with the prosecutors and reduce his jail sentence. &amp;nbsp; **Rosensteins replacement.** Numerous outlets reported last week that Deputy Attorney General (DAG) Rod Rosenstein [plans to leave](URL the DOJ in mid-March, citing an unnamed Justice Dept. official. While Rosenstein has previously announced his intention to leave, the exact time frame is likely still fluid. Current deputy secretary of the Department of Transportation, Jeffrey Rosen, is [going to be](URL nominated to take over Rosensteins job. * There are many skeptics of Rosens nomination, as he has never worked in the Justice Dept. and has no prosecutorial experience. As [PBS](URL explained, a background in federal prosecution is important to for the deputy attorney general in particular because some of the key duties of the position include authorizing searches and electronic surveillance. * Politico published a [detailed piece](URL by Julie Rodin Zebrak, an 18 year veteran of the DOJ, on how ill-suited for the job Rosen actually is, saying the deputy role is widely known as the hardest job at DOJthe deputy is known as the work horse. * Zebrak continued: What should give the Senate pause in evaluating his nomination is that the head of the Criminal Division, the head of the National Security Division, the director of the FBI, the administrator of the DEA and all of the U.S. attorneys will report directly to a potential DAG Rosen who, if confirmed, will lack any meaningful experience over the subject matter for which they are seeking his approval and guidance In effect, Rosen will be learning how to fly a plane while actually flying the plane, but with one arm tied behind his back. * Finally, the key part of Zebraks piece: While Rosen may be capable and smart, placing someone with no institutional knowledge and without the experience related to DOJs core mission, represents yet another assault on the Justice Department as an institution. &amp;nbsp; **Backup plan.** The Associated Press [confirmed](URL former acting FBI director Andrew McCabes report that after Comeys firing, the FBI created a plan to protect evidence should Trump attempt to fire other senior officials (including Mueller) and end the Russia investigation. AP: The plan was crafted in the chaotic days after Comey was fired, when the FBI began investigating whether President Donald Trump had obstructed justice and whether he might be, wittingly or not, in league with the Russians. &amp;nbsp; **Whitakers perjury?** It would appear that former acting AG Matthew Whitaker lied to Congress when he said Trump never pressured him about any of the various investigations surrounding the president. In a wide-ranging article by the [New York Times](URL it was revealed that Trump asked Whitaker if his ally, SDNY attorney Geoffrey Berman, could be put in charge of the investigation into hush payments during the 2016 election. According to several sources, Whitaker told Trump he couldnt do that because Berman already recused himself, leading Trump to become frustrated and disappointed with Whitakers inability to...make the presidents many legal problems go away. * Trump denied the claims made in the NYT piece, saying No, I dont know who gave you that, thats more fake news. A DOJ spokeswoman also said the incident never occurred. &amp;nbsp; #OTHER **Maines Emoluments.** A local Maine news outlet [obtained documents](URL that show former governor LePage spent at least $22,000 of Maine taxpayer money at Trumps International Hotel in DC. According to the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram, the spending levels at the Trump hotel were so high that they were flagged by a worker in the state controllers office. In addition to paying hundreds to thousands of dollars on rooms, LePage and his associates spent hundreds on expensive menu items at the hotel. The reason for the trips were simply to meet with Trump and/or lawmakers. * The LePage administration refused to provide his travel records for over a year, despite continuing requests from the press. It wasnt until LePage left office that the documents were released. From 2017 through part of 2019, LePage and his administration charged taxpayers about $170,000 in out-of-state travel by LePage and staff members. &amp;nbsp; ------------------------------------------------------------- #Too long; didnt read section (as short as possible) *A DOJ official has assured everyone that Muellers report is not, in fact, expected this week. The NY District Attorney has assembled a variety of criminal charges against Paul Manafort that are ready to be quickly filed if Trump decides to pardon him. Manafort is scheduled to be sentenced on March 8 in the Virginia case against him. Then, a week later, Manafort will be sentenced in the DC case on March 13. Roger Stone posted a picture on Instagram of the judge presiding over his case, Amy Berman Jackson, with crosshairs beside her head. In response, the judge ordered him to court to explain himself; she expanded the gag order, prohibiting Stone from speaking publicly about the case or its participants except to raise funds for his defense and maintain his innocence.* *Numerous whistleblowers came forward to report that top Trump officials have continued to pursue a plan, originally spearheaded by Michael Flynn, to supply Saudi Arabia with nuclear power plants. One of the nuclear companies is owned by a firm that also bought a stake in a troubled Manhattan skyscraper owned by Jared Kushners family company. Former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe confirmed that he has been interview by Mueller.* *A wide-ranging and ongoing disinformation campaign targeting Democratic 2020 front-runners is already underway. Microsoft announced the detection of another hacking attempt of think-tanks that have been critical of Putin and the Kremlin. Every 2020 candidate has pledged not to knowingly use hacked or stolen material during the campaign except Trump. In a speech last week, Putin blamed to US for starting an arms race and threatened to aim weapons at the US if American missiles are placed in Europe. Despite Trump pulling out of the INF treaty, Putin didnt criticize him; instead, Putin blamed a secret deep state for holding Trump back and working against him.* *Michael Cohen is set to testify this Wednesday, Feb. 27, before the House Oversight Committee in a public hearing (at 10 am eastern). The announcement came just hours after a federal judge agreed to delay Cohens deadline to report to jail by 60 days. Reps. Ted Lieu and Kathleen Rice announced an investigation into the NRAs ties to the Kremlin.* *The Senate Intelligence Committee has been interviewing witnesses about Trumps ties to American businessman, based in Moscow, David Geovanis. Geovanis organized Trumps 1996 trip to Moscow and showed him around the proposed site of Trump Tower Moscow. Last month, Michael Cohen gave Manhattan federal prosecutors more information on possible irregularities within the presidents family business and about a donor to the inaugural committee. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein plans to leave the DOJ in mid-March; his replacement is deputy secretary of the Department of Transportation, Jeffrey Rosen. Trump asked Whitaker if his ally, SDNY attorney Geoffrey Berman, could be put in charge of the investigation into hush payments during the 2016 election.* "

The company, Woodlawn LLC, has offered to identify the source if Mueller promised it would be kept confidential, but Mueller refused. Woodlawn is attempting to proceed in collecting the $1 million from Manafort's assets seized by the government. The two parties are currently involved in a court battle over the matter. * Perhaps of interest: The former managing member of Woodlawn was Joey Rappa, who ""was working on a movie with Andrew Intrater, an American financier who is a cousin of Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg."" Intrater is also the CEO of a company that gave $250,000 to Trump's inauguration and paid Cohen $500,000 for ""consulting."" &amp;nbsp; **Sentencing.** Manafort's lawyers [submitted](URL a sentencing memo in the Virginia-based case against him, arguing he should not be sent to jail because he isn't at risk of re-offending and has already been ""personally and financially punished."" However, I'd like to note that Manafort already re-offended after promising not to in the plea agreement with Mueller. Manafort is set to be sentenced in this case March 8 and in the DC case March 13. &amp;nbsp; #Mueller: Stone **Trial.** On Friday, Muellers team [submitted](URL a court filing stating they believe they only need five to eight days to present their case against Roger Stone. &amp;nbsp; **Gag order.** Roger Stone has been tempting Judge Amy Berman to send him to jail by repeatedly breaking the gag order she issued following his threatening instagram post. On Friday, the judge discovered Stone is [about to release a book](URL that could include details of the legal cases hes been involved in, violating the gag order. She demanded to know why he didnt inform the court of the book and gave his lawyers until Monday (today) to respond. Then, on Sunday, Stone [posted an image](URL to Instagram suggesting he was framed by Mueller, which again is against the gag order. He deleted the post hours after the press contacted him for comment. &amp;nbsp; #Mueller: Other **Another win.** Roger Stones associate, Andrew Miller, lost another court battle against Mueller last week. Miller was subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury last year and refused to appear, resulting in a charge of civil contempt. His lawyers appealed the decision and argued that Muellers appointment was not valid and, due to the immense power of a special prosecutor, should have been at the discretion of the president with confirmation by the Senate. The [DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled](URL that Muellers appointment is valid and upheld the contempt charges. This is the third time Muellers appointment has been approved by a court of law. Miller may attempt to take the case to the Supreme Court. * Miller was [originally subpoenaed](URL for evidence on Roger Stone, WikiLeaks, Assange, Guccifer 2.0, and DCLeaks. &amp;nbsp; #RUSSIA NEWS **Asking advice.** According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, the Trump administration [consulted the Kremlin](URL before meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un in Vietnam. While the White House has not confirmed this, Lavrov claims the US sought advice on negotiations with North Korea and asked for the Russian perspective on the Hanoi summit. Russian officials reportedly responded that the US should offer security guarantees for disarmament and pushed for an action for an action approach. Just days after asking advice, Russian state TV [listed](URL US military facilities - including the Pentagon - Moscow will target with hypersonic missiles. * There has been criticism of Trump for placing his trust in the word of adversaries over reports from his own intelligence agencies and advisers. For instance, former FBI acting director Andrew McCabe [recounted an incident](URL where Trump said he believed North Korea did not have the capability to launch intercontinental missiles because Putin told him so. Intelligence officials responded that that was not consistent with any of the intelligence our government possesses. To which the president replied, I dont care. I believe Putin. * In another example, Trump announced the US would suspend large-scale joint military exercises with South Korea following his first summit with Kim Jong-un. The decision came as a surprise to the South Koreans and to the Pentagon, but [not to Putin](URL Prior to the first summit, Trump met with Putin at the 2017 G-20 summit in Hamburg. The Russian leader reportedly gave Trump the idea to stop joint military exercises to help moderate Kim Jong Uns behavior. The Kremlin was very pleased, [congratulating itself](URL Putin was right, a spokesman said. The only possible path is one of direct dialogue. * As you may know, Trump made the [same announcement](URL last week after the second summit with Kim Jong-un. This is because small scale joint exercises continued, but now those will be stopped as well. &amp;nbsp; **Cyber op.** According to [US sources](URL US Cyber Command undertook an operation that blocked internet access to the Internet Research Agency, aka the Russian troll factory, during the 2018 midterms. The troll factory confirmed the attack, but [claimed](URL it only disabled half of its server's hard drives and did not stop work entirely. The Pentagon has celebrated the operation as a success. Others aren't as sure: Thomas Rid, a strategic-studies professor at Johns Hopkins University , said that such an operation would be more of a pinprick that is more annoying than deterring in the long run."" #CONGRESS **Cohens public hearing.** As we all probably know, Michael Cohen testified before the House Oversight Committee last week. This wont be a blow-by-blow of the entire hearing (but if you want that, [heres a link](URL Instead, I will pull out some of the highlights of the hearing. Keep in mind that Cohen could not testify about anything Mueller is investigating, so Russian collusion was largely not discussed in public. * Perhaps the most legally dangerous testimony was about Trumps violations of campaign finance laws. [Cohen said](URL Trump directed him to procure a home-equity loan to make a hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. To back this up, Cohen even brought documentation: a check signed by Trump, dated August 1, 2017, for $35,000. There are 10 more checks that add up to the $130,000 reimbursement. Additionally, Cohen said Trump directed him to lie and tell the public Trump had no knowledge of the hush money payments. * Cohen told the House committee that [he heard Trump](URL on the phone with Roger Stone das before the Democratic National Convention discussing Wikileaks. Stone reportedly told Trump he talked to Julian Assange about an upcoming massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clintons campaign. Cohen said Trumps response was similar to wouldnt that be great. Crucially, the timing of this call was after the DNC announced it had been hacked by Russia; Trump would have known of Russias involvement in any hacked Democratic emails. * Cohen admitted to lying to Congress about the end of Trump Tower Moscow negotiations with Russia. In his 2017 testimony, Cohen said negotiations ended in June 2016 when in reality Cohen say it ended in June 2016. During those six months, Cohen estimated that Trump asked him for updates on negotiations ""at least a half-dozen times."" While Trump never specifically told Cohen to lie, Cohen said Trump ""in his way"" indicated Cohen was supposed to hide the truth. Further, [Cohen testified](URL that ""Trump's personal lawyers reviewed and edited"" his 2017 statement to Congress about the Moscow project. When asked for specific names, Cohen said he wasn't sure of everyone who reviewed and/or edited his statement, but he named Jay Sekulow and Abbe Lowell (Ivanka and Jared's attorney). * The goal in Cohen's 2017 testimony, in which he lied, ""was to stay on message."" He continued, ""Its just limit the relationship whatsoever with Russia. It was short. Theres no Russian contacts. Theres no Russian collusion. Theres no Russian deals. Thats the message. Thats the message that existed well before my need to come and testify. Jay Sekulow denied editing Cohen's 2017 statement: Todays testimony by Michael Cohen that attorneys for the President edited or changed his statement to Congress to alter the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations is completely false, Sekulow wrote to the Washington Post. * Cohen [hinted](URL that there is an ongoing Manhattan federal investigation involving Trump. Washington Post: Asked whether there was any other wrongdoing or illegal act that you are aware of regarding Donald Trump that had not been discussed at the hearing, Cohen responded, Yes, and again, those are part of the investigation thats currently being looked at by the Southern District of New York. * Trump [routinely deflated](URL the value of his properties to reduce his tax bill and he bragged about receiving a $10 million tax refund in 2008 from the stupid government after slashing his employees wages. Cohen hasnt seen any proof that Trumps tax returns are under audit, which is the reason cited for Trump not releasing them to the public. ""I asked for a copy of the audit so that I could use it in terms of my statements to the press. And I was never able to obtain one,"" Cohen said. Furthermore, Cohen also said Trump hasnt released his taxes because he feared he would face an audit and tax penalties as a result. &amp;nbsp; **Cohen's private testimony.** In addition to his public testimony, Cohen also testified privately to the Senate and House Intelligence Committees. Behind closed doors, Cohen was able to divulge more sensitive details, including those under investigation by Mueller and/or federal prosecutors. [The Washington Post](URL reported lawmakers in both houses ""pressed Cohen this week on whether he had had any discussions about a possible pardon and, if so, when and with whom those conversations took place."" The answer to this question could potentially lead to obstruction of justice charges. &amp;nbsp; **Gaetz.** On Tuesday, the day before Cohen testified to the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Matt Gaetz [sent a tweet](URL threatening to reveal Cohen's alleged marital infidelity. The implication is that if Cohen testified at the hearing, information would be revealed that could damage his marriage. If Cohen didn't testify, that information would stay secret. This clearly appears to be witness tampering. The Florida Bar opened an investigation into Gaetz. Then, at Cohens hearing, Gates made sure he was seen conferring with Republican members of the committee. After the hearing, a writer for The Atlantic overheard Gaetz on a telephone conversation with Trump, during which Gaetz allegedly said: ""I was happy to do it for you. You just keep killing it."" Dovere stated on Twitter Gaetz was clearly talking about ""the Cohen testimony and the threats (since rescinded) Gaetz made about Cohen."" When asked about it, Gaetz told Dovere that he doesn't discuss calls with the president. &amp;nbsp; **Upcoming investigations.** Rep. Elijah Cummings, Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, will [seek to interview](URL many of the people Cohen mentioned during his testimony, including Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Allen Weisselberg, Trump Organization CFO. Additionally, Rep. Nadler, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, [said Monday](URL (today) his committee will issue ""document requests to over 60 different people and individuals from the White House to the Department of Justice, Donald Trump, Jr., Allen Weisselberg, to begin the investigations to present the case to the American people about obstruction of justice, corruption and abuse of power. &amp;nbsp; **Hannity.** While interviewing Trump Thursday night, Fox News personality Sean Hannity [volunteered information](URL about Cohen and campaign finance violations. Hannity told Trump that Cohen told him ""at least a dozen times"" that ""he made the decision on the payments -- and he didn't tell you He told me that personally. Rep. David Cicilline, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, told CNN volunteering such first-hand information made Sean Hannity liable to be subpoenaed to testify. In court proceedings last year, it was revealed the Hannity was a client of Michael Cohen. &amp;nbsp; **Clearance investigation.** Rep. Cummings is also [opening an investigation](URL into security clearances of White House officials. In a letter to White House lawyers, Cummings gave White House lawyers until March 4 to submit all requested documents and schedule interviews for the identified witnesses. The decision came after the NYT reported that ""Trump ordered his chief of staff to grant his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, a top-secret security clearance last year, overruling concerns flagged by intelligence officials and the White Houses top lawyer."" * Abbe Lowell [issued a denial](URL Mr. Lowell was not aware of nor told of any request for or action by the President to be involved in the security clearance process. Again, officials affirmed at the time that the regular process occurred without any pressure. Former director of the US Office of Government Ethics [Walter Shaub translated](URL Lowells statement to mean: Kushner not only failed to tell him of Trumps intervention but failed to do so even after Lowell publicly vouched for the lack of presidential intervention. If Kushner knew of Lowells statement (how could he not?), it says volumes about his character. &amp;nbsp; **Whitaker perjury?** Two weeks ago, [The New York Times](URL revealed that Trump asked former acting AG Matthew Whitaker if his ally, SDNY attorney Geoffrey Berman, could be put in charge of the investigation into Michael Cohen. However, when Whitaker testified before the House, he said Trump never pressured him about any of the various investigations connected to Trump. As the [Wall Street Journal](URL reported last week, the House Judiciary Committee believes it has evidence that Trump did indeed ask Whitaker to put Berman in charge, thus making Whitakers statement to congress a lie and perjury. &amp;nbsp; #OTHER INVESTIGATIONS **Campaign finance.** Government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) [released a report](URL on Trumps campaign finance-related crimes conducted as a candidate and during his first year in office. CREW concluded that Trump potentially committed eight offenses, seven of which are felonies. Five of these violations involved the willful direction, receipt, and concealment of unlawful contributions to his campaign. Two of the violations were felonies resulting from the cover-up of the five campaign finance crimes. And, finally, CREW believes Trump potentially participated in a criminal conspiracy to perpetrate these offenses and/or defraud the United States by undermining the FEC. * Excerpt from the report: It is also significant that Trumps potential criminal conduct continued well into his presidency. The apparent criminal conspiracy to orchestrate and cover up the hush money payments continued at least through the end of 2017, and President Trump appears to have clearly committed at least one additional criminal actthe false statement on his public financial disclosure formin June 2017. Were President Trump an ordinary citizen, unprotected by the Department of Justices policy of not seeking indictment of a sitting president, he could well be facing the prospect of imminent criminal charges. * Reminder: The Southern District of New York filed a [sentencing memo](URL in their case against Michael Cohen in which prosecutors indicated Trump participated in a conspiracy with Cohen to commit campaign finance fraud - a felony. In the memo, SDNY stated: In particular, and as Cohen himself has now admitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1 [Trump]. * While we are not privy to the entire body of evidence SDNY has on Cohen and Trump, Lanny Davis released a tape last year of a conversation between the two men. On the recording, Trump discussed with Cohen the best way to buy the rights to Playboy Playmate Karen MacDougals story from AMI. The parent company of the National Enquirer had paid MacDougal $125,000 in a catch-and-kill scheme to keep her story secret and her quiet about the affair with Trump. * As [NBC News](URL laid out, in order to charge Trump with a crime rather than a civil violation, the prosecutors would need to prove intent. The fact that Trump tried to cover up the hush money payments truly dooms him. The repeated lies would not have been necessary had he made a mistake and simply forgotten to disclose the payments. Unfortunately, Cohen has so far refused to cooperate fully with the SDNY, perhaps to protect his father-in-law, meaning his testimony cannot be used to charge Trump. &amp;nbsp; **Inaugural &amp; Qatar.** A Tennessee news outlet called the Daily Memphian [published an interview](URL with billionaire Franklin Haney, who is involved in the Manhattan US attorneys office investigation into Trumps inaugural committee. Haney gave the committee $1 million dollars while also seeking massive funding for a nuclear power plant in Alabama. Prosecutors are investigating whether any donors, including Haney, gave money in order to curry favor with the new administration. But that was [already known](URL Haney divulged new details of Trumps involvement in the deal: in early 2018, Trump reportedly brought a member of Qatars sovereign wealth fund (QIA) to Haneys table at Mar-a-Lago, praising the nuclear project and suggesting Qatar invest. * Shortly after the introduction to the Qatari official, Haney said Michael Cohen inserted himself into the deal. Cohen was treated like royalty with the Qataris because he was the presidents lawyer, Haney added. [According to the WSJ](URL Haney agreed to pay Cohen $10 million if he could get all the necessary funding for the project, which included $5 billion in loans from the US government. However, Haney said Cohen was going to receive $5 million for securing an investment from the Qataris and he wasnt paying Cohen to lock down US government funding. Haney broke off the partnership with Cohen when the FBI raided his offices in April 2018 after paying him only $200,000. * The QIA has appeared [numerous times](URL in Trump World stories. For instance, the QIA financed the purchase of a 99 year lease of Kushner's sinking property 666 Fifth Avenue. Kushner owed $1.4 billion on the building, which was due this month. Luckily for him, Brookfield Properties acquired a 100% leasehold interest in the building for 99 years. The QIA just so happens to be a major investor in Brookfield, but claims it had no idea its money was used to bail out Kushner. * The QIA is also one of the top suspects in the case of the mystery company challenging Mueller's grand jury subpoena. * And that's not even mentioning the fact that Qatari investor Ahmed Al-Rumaihi, head of an internal division of QIA, attended a meeting in December 2016 at Trump Tower with Trump transition officials. He is pictured with Michael Flynn and Michael Cohen in the lobby. This meeting occurred shortly after the QIA and Glencore agreed to jointly acquire a 19.5 percent stake in Russian oil company Rosneft. &amp;nbsp; #OTHER **Pay to play.** In another instance of companies currying favor with Trump by frequenting his properties, a large payday loan trade group is [holding its annual conference](URL at Trumps south Florida golf resort. Before Trump became president, the group met in California. In 2017, they moved the conference to Trumps resort, corresponding with the intense lobbying by payday loan companies to undo Obama-era consumer protection rules. Just weeks ago, the CFPB [announced](URL it would roll back the rules, pending a 90-day comment period. Thus, its no coincidence that just like in 2017, this year the trade group is again booking out Trump properties. &amp;nbsp; ------------------------------------------------------------- #Too long; didnt read section (as short as possible) The former chief of staff to White House counsel Don McGahn took exhaustive notes about Trumps behavior in the West Wing - notes that Mueller has in his possession. A Nevada company that loaned Manafort $1 million in August 2017 is fighting Mueller to keep the ultimate source of the money secret. Manafort's lawyers submitted a sentencing memo in the Virginia-based case against him, arguing he should not be sent to jail because he isn't at risk of re-offending. Muellers team submitted a court filing stating they believe they only need five to eight days to present their case against Roger Stone. Roger Stone has been tempting Judge Amy Berman to send him to jail by repeatedly breaking the gag order against him: he didnt tell the judge about a book about to be released and posted an image to Instagram suggesting Mueller framed him. Roger Stones associate, Andrew Miller, lost another court battle against Mueller last week: The DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Muellers appointment is valid and upheld the contempt charges against Miller. According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, the Trump administration consulted the Kremlin before meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. According to US sources, US Cyber Command undertook an operation that blocked internet access to the Internet Research Agency, aka the Russian troll factory, during the 2018 midterms. The troll factory confirmed the attack, but claimed it only disabled half of its server's hard drives and did not stop work entirely. Michael Cohen testified before the House Oversight Committee last week. Cohen said Trump directed him to lie and tell the public Trump had no knowledge of the hush money payments to Daniels and MacDougal. Cohen said Trump knew of the Wikileaks DNC email drop in advance. Cohen said Trump had him lie about negotiations on Trump Tower Moscow and Trumps personal lawyers edited his original lying statement to Congress. Cohen hinted that there is an on-going Manhattan federal investigation involving Trump. Trump routinely deflated the value of his properties to reduce his tax bill and may have lied about being under audit in order to hide his tax returns. In private hearings, lawmakers in both houses ""pressed Cohen this week on whether he had had any discussions about a possible pardon and, if so, when and with whom those conversations took place."" Rep. Gaetz may have committed witness tampering by tweeted a threat to Cohen before the hearing. The Florida Bar is investigating. The House Oversight Committee will seek interviews with many of the people Cohen mentioned during his testimony, including Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Allen Weisselberg, Trump Organization CFO. The House Judiciary Committee will issue document requests to over 60 different people and individuals from the White House to the Department of Justice, Donald Trump, Jr., and Allen Weisselberg. The House Oversight Committee is also opening an investigation into security clearances of White House officials following a report that Trump personally ordered Jared Kushner be given a top-secret security clearance last year, overruling concerns flagged by intelligence officials and the White Houses top lawyer.

The brief exchange was public, Stone contended. * **Mar. 20, 2017**  FBI Director James Comey testifies to the House committee about Russian interference in the 2016 election and publicly confirms that there is an existing counterintelligence investigation into links to the Trump campaign. &gt;I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts. Stone is [mentioned by name nineteen times](URL during the hearing. That evening, [McClatchy reports](URL that investigators are examining coordination between the Russians and far-right news sites, including Breitbart and InfoWars, as well as RT and Sputnik. * **Mar. 22, 2017**  Stranahan [leaves Breitbart](URL claiming that he quit in protest of being prohibited from covering the White House. * **Apr. 5, 2017**  [The Atlantic reports](URL that Stranahan will begin working for Sputnik.

We talk politics. Beyond that, I'm not going to characterize it because if I do then that indiscretion would most likely mean that those conversations would end. * **Apr. 23, 2017**  Stone [tells an audience](URL at the Tribeca Film Festival that he has regular contact with Trump. Asked if he still advises Trump, Stone replies that he talks to Trump from time to time, adding, I certainly wouldnt divulge the content of those conversations or they would end. The president needs to be able to get advice and not have it end up on the front page of The New York Times. * **May 2017**  The House committee requests that Stone testify and provide documents and material that might pertain to their investigation. * **May 9, 2017**  Trump fires Comey.

Stone also denies having contacted anyone within the Trump campaign about his conversations with his intermediary. During one exchange, Stone falsely and misleadingly claims only to have spoken with his intermediary telephonically: &gt;Q: [H]ow did you communicate with the intermediary? &gt;A: Over the phone. &gt;Q: And did you have any other means of communicating with the intermediary? &gt;A: No. &gt;Q: No text messages, no  none of the list, right? &gt;A: No. Later during his testimony, Stone again falsely denies ever communicating with his intermediary in writing: &gt;Q: So you never communicated with your intermediary in writing in any way? &gt;A: No. &gt;Q: Never emailed him or texted him? &gt;: Hes not an email guy. &gt;Q: So all your conversations with him were in person or over the phone. &gt;A: Correct.

On to the review... &amp;nbsp; ##Week of Dec 9 - 15: What We Learned in the Trump and Russia Probes &amp;nbsp; #MUELLER INVESTIGATION #Mueller: Trump **Trump Tower Moscow.** Trumps lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, [said](URL that according to Trumps written response to Muellers questions, Michael Cohen could have been working on the Trump Tower Moscow deal up to November 2016. This is significant because Trump was briefed and warned by the FBI in August 2016 that Russians would try to infiltrate his campaign and influence the election. Yet, Trump still pursued the Moscow deal, aware (according to Cohen) that Russian government officials had been contacted by his team to make the deal happen. * Trumps team (as well as Hillarys) was urged to alert the FBI to any suspicious overtures to their campaigns.This may be an outdated count, but according to the original story published last year, by the time of the warning, at least seven Trump campaign officials had been in contact with Russians or people linked to Russia. &amp;nbsp; #Mueller: Manafort **Advising WH.** Manafort [advised](URL Trump administration officials in spring and summer of 2017 on how to undermine the FBI and the Mueller investigation. He also advised them on how to discredit potential witnesses against both himself and Trump. Officials, including Trump, appear to have acted on his advice in most instances. There is direct evidence that when Press Secretary Sarah Sanders encouraged reporters to investigate how the Democrat National Committee coordinated opposition research directly with the Ukrainian Embassy, she was acting on Manaforts advice. * In addition to claiming (without evidence) that the DNC colluded with the pro-Western Ukrainian government, Manafort also advised officials to aggressively and directly attack the FBI, including for using FISA warrants to surveil Manafort and Carter Page, and to attack Clinton and the Steele dossier. According to Vox, it was Manafort who provided the White House specific information on how Hillary Clintons presidential campaign had sponsored research into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. * At the time Manafort was assisting Trump and co. delegitimize the FBI and Muellers investigation, he was under criminal investigation, a fact then known to the White House. &amp;nbsp; #Mueller: Flynn **Flynns Kremlin plan.** Two associates of Michael Flynn told [Mother Jones](URL that Flynn has said he spoke with Russian ambassador Kislyak before the 2016 election about how Trump could work productively with Russia if he won the presidency. One of these people said Flynn discussed a grand bargain with Kislyak, wherein Moscow would assist in resolving the Syrian conflict and Trump would end or ease up on sanctions against Russia. * Mother Jones: Had Flynn privately met or communicated with Kislyak during the summer or fall, it would mean Trumps chief national security aide was secretly interacting with the representative of a foreign power as that government was mounting information and cyber warfare against the United States. Such an interaction could signal to the Vladimir Putin regime that Trump didnt mind the Kremlins interference in the election and would be willing to work with Moscow despite its efforts to subvert the US election. And if Flynn held such conversations with the Russian ambassador, this could have bolstered the Kremlins preference for Trump over Hillary Clinton and provided Moscow with further incentive for intervening in the 2016 campaign to assist Trump. * Note that Jeff Sessions, then a Republican senator and strong Trump-supporter, met with Kislyak twice in 2016. Once in September in his Senate office. &amp;nbsp; **Lyin memo.** On Tuesday, Michael Flynn [filed a memo](URL with the court asking for no jail time and at most one year probation with 200 hours of community service. This is congruous with Muellers sentencing recommendation of little to no jail time for his substantial assistance in their investigation. However, Flynns filing implied the FBI conducted itself improperly and hadnt warned Flynn that lying the FBI was a crime before interviewing him about his contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. On Friday, Muellers team [hit back](URL saying Flynns lies were premeditated and, as his extensive government service would indicate, he should know not to lie to federal agents. * Flynns lawyers [further wrote](URL that his lying to the FBI was just an uncharacteristic error in judgment. Yet prosecutors said they had given him numerous opportunities in the interview to tell the truth, even repeating portions of Flynns account to jog his memory. But the defendant never corrected his false statements. * In contrast to the claims in the memo, when Flynn originally entered a guilty plea to charges of lying to the FBI, he said, I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong. * Additionally, prosecutors state Flynn made false statements about his lobbying work on behalf of Turkey - during an interview where he was given an explicit warning about lying to federal investigators. * Flynn's memo [states](URL he provided over 62 hours of interviews, provided thousands of documents, and facilitated the ""production of electronic devices."" &amp;nbsp; #Mueller: Other **New phase.** Sources have told the [Daily Beast](URL that Muellers team is set to reveal a different side of his investigation: one focused on Middle Eastern countries attempts to influence American politics. Mueller has been questioning witnesses about the following countries: UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Israel. The topics included their use of social media to help install Trump in the White House and using Trump to overthrow the regime in Iran. * We already have a hint of what Mueller has been looking into. For instance, George Nader acted as an intermediary between the Trump team and representatives from Gulf state governments, and at least one Israeli (Joel Zamel of Psy Group). Nader has been cooperating with Mueller since March. &amp;nbsp; **Mueller sued.** Jerome Corsi [filed a lawsuit](URL against Mueller, the FBI, and the DOJ accusing Mueller of blackmailing him to testify that he served as an intermediary between Julian Assange and Roger Stone. He also accuses the FBI, CIA, and NSA, of illegally surveilling Corsi ""at the direction of Mueller and his partisan Democrat, leftist, and ethically and legally conflicted prosecutorial staff."" &amp;nbsp; #MORE RUSSIA NEWS **Butina plea.** Russian spy Maria Butina [reached a plea agreement](URL with prosecutors on Monday, in which she admitted to working for Russia (specifically, under the direction or Alexander Torshin) before and after the 2016 election to infiltrate Republican politics and influence US-Russian relations. As part of this operation, she admitted to focusing on cozying up to the NRA because she believed it had influence over the GOP. Her estimated sentence is up to 6 months in jail, but she has already been imprisoned for five. * On Friday, prosecutors [accidentally filed](URL a travel request with a federal judge that was meant to be under deal, but accidentally appeared on the public docket. In the document, prosecutors requested permission to move Butina to and from jail through January 17th for ongoing interviews and possible transportation to a grand jury. &amp;nbsp; #CONGRESS **NRA-Russia.** Congressional committees [plan to continue](URL their investigation into links between the NRA and Russia operatives. Mother Jones reported the Senate Intelligence Committee is highly skeptical of the NRAs claim that Russian national - and Butinas handler - Alexander Torshin only donated less than $1,000 and was not a member of any major donor program. The House Intelligence Committee plans to examine whether Torshin and Butina were attempting to establish a backchannel to the Kremlin, and whether Russian money was funneled through the NRA to support Trumps election. * One of the reasons to doubt the NRAs claim is the pile of evidence that they gave Torshin the same VIP treatment as given to big donors. For example, pictures uncovered by Mother Jones show Torshin at a variety of high profile NRA events, including a ceremony in which donors had to give at least $1 million to attend. Guests at the ceremony received custom gold jackets. While at the NRAs 2013 conference, Torshin was given a rifle as a gift. * Torshin is also pictured with high-profile individuals within the NRA, such as the former president (and current board member), incoming president, and former operations director. In a tweet, Torshin said he and his friends were treated as guests of the highest level. * You may remember that John Bolton (now national security adviser) recorded a video address that was used by Butinas Russian gun-rights group. The House Oversight Committee plans to investigate Boltons security clearance, including whether Bolton disclosed his role in the video and any other contacts he had with foreign nationals. * [Rolling Stone reported](URL on the NRAs Russian connections earlier this year. Torshin bragged on Twitter in 2012 that he was able to observe the election because of his NRA contacts. Torshin even inspected electronic voting machines and election queues: Torshin, I think, snapped pictures and sent them to Moscow immediately, an American lawyer and friend of Torshin said. &amp;nbsp; **Deutsche bank.** Rep. Adam Schiff, soon to be chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, [plans to](URL subpoena information of Trumps transactions with Deutsche Bank. He believes answers to whether Trump was involved in money laundering with Russia lie in records held by the bank, which Trump used extensively in the 1990s. Schiff asked, Is that why Trump is so pro-Russian? Is his financial interest guiding his foreign policy? &amp;nbsp; #STATES **Inauguration.** Manhattan federal prosecutors [are investigating](URL Trumps inaugural committee for possible financial and corruption crimes. One of the questions is whether top donors gave money to gain access to the incoming Trump administration to influence policy positions, aka pay to play. Prosecutors are also looking into if any of $107 million raised through donations was misspent. One of the items seized during the raid of Michael Cohens office was a recorded conversation between Cohen and Melanias lawyer in which the latter expressed concerns about how money was being spent. &amp;nbsp; #DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE **Cohen sentencing.** Michael Cohen was [sentenced](URL to three years in prison on Wednesday for executing payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal during Trumps campaign, as well as tax fraud and making false statements to a bank. Cohen stated he took full responsibility for his actions, but explained blind loyalty to Trump led him to choose a path of darkness over light. * Cohen continued: ""Recently, the President tweeted a statement calling me 'weak,' and he was correct, but for a much different reason than he was implying. It was because time and time again I felt it was my duty to cover up his dirty deeds rather than to listen to my own inner voice and my moral compass."" * Cohens lawyer, Lanny Davis, said that after Muellers investigation is complete, Cohen will state publicly all he knows about Mr. Trump."" He added that he will assist Cohen in testifying before Congress as well. * Why what Cohen, and Trump, did [was illegal](URL First, Cohen caused the National Enquirers parent company to pay $150,000 to Karen McDougal, which violated the law because it was essentially a campaign contribution for Trump in excess of the legal limit. Cohen and prosecutors stated Trump was well aware of this payment. The payment to Stormy Daniels, on the other hand, is illegal because Cohen made an excessive campaign contribution himself. This, too, was effectively a campaign contribution for Trump above what Cohen was permitted to give. Cohen and prosecutors said Trump directed this payment too. &amp;nbsp; **AMI deal.** The parent company of National Enquirer, AMI, reached an agreement with prosecutors to avoid charges. AMI admitted to making the $150k payment in concert with a candidates presidential campaign (i.e. Trumps campaign) to keep McDougal from publicizing her allegations against Trump before the election. AMI further admitted its principal purpose in making the payment was to prevent the womans story from influencing the election. * Crucially, Trump was *in the room* with Cohen and David Pecker (National Enquirer publisher) when they arranged paying off McDougal. [Former assistant US attorney](URL ""...if Trump is now in the room, as early as August of 2015 and in combination with the recording where Trump clearly knows what Cohen is talking about with regarding to David Pecker, you now squarely place Trump in the middle of a conspiracy to commit campaign finance fraud."" * Until this week, it was largely Mr. Cohens word against the presidents denials. That is [why](URL the admission by A.M.I. is highly significant, because it goes to corroborate Mr. Cohens testimony. &amp;nbsp; **Giulianis defense?** Trumps lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, [downplayed](URL the payments to McDougal and Daniels, saying: Nobody got killed, nobody got robbed This was not a big crime I think in two weeks theyll start with parking tickets that havent been paid. * Note, the article that reports Giulianis comments is mainly about Jared Kushners relationship with David Pecker and is worth a read. &amp;nbsp; **Natl Enquirer.** Im going to include this here because it is related to the AMI deal, which suggests that the company is working with prosecutors on issues other than the payment to McDougal. [The Atlantic](URL detailed additional forms of assistance the National Enquirer provided to Trumps campaign, including consistent negative stories about Hillary Clinton. For instance, tabloids owned by AMI ran 35 covers with anti-Clinton stories. * Media scholar Kathleen Jamieson: Even as we look at extreme content and say, Thats ridiculous, I dismiss that, it changes our sense of where the middle of the distribution of the content is, she says. It pushes open our acceptance of extreme content. * Atlantic: Beyond that, many of the stories in the National Enquirer echoed, or inspired, conspiracy theories that circulated online, creating even more familiarity and exposure. &amp;nbsp; #OTHER **Broidy update.** Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy was up to lots of swampy behavior, selling his influence with Trump to foreign governments. Mueller has been investigating his involvement in such [schemes](URL in the Middle East (with Rick Gates and George Nader), but now we know of [yet another](URL deal: Broidy hooked up top Angolan government officials with members of Congress and the Trump administration in the hopes of securing a deal to control billions of dollars in oil, gas, and mining assets in Angola.

Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance \- So far TRUMP has declined various sweetener real estate business deals offered him in Russia in order to further the Kremlins cultivation of him. However he and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals \- Former top Russian intelligence officer claims FSB has compromised TRUMP through his activities in Moscow sufficiently to be able to blackmail him. According to several knowledgeable sources, his conduct in Moscow has included perverted sexual acts which have been arranged/monitored by the FSB A dossier of compromising material on Hillary CLINTON has been collated by the Russian Intelligence Services over many years and mainly comprises bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls rather than any embarrassing conduct. The dossier is controlled by Kremlin spokesman, PESKOV, directly on PUTINS orders. However it has not as yet been distributed abroad, including to TRUMP. Russian intentions for its deployment still unclear &amp;#x200B; **Detail** &amp;#x200B; 1. Speaking to a trusted compatriot in June 2016 sources A and B, a senior Russian Foreign Ministry figure and a former top level Russian intelligence officer still active inside the Kremlin respectively, the Russian authorities had been cultivating and supporting US Republican presidential candidate, Donald TRUMP for at least 5 years. Source B asserted that the TRUMP operation was both supported and directed by Russian President Vladimir PUTIN. Its aim was to sow discord and disunity both within the US itself, but more specially within the Transatlantic alliance which was viewed as inimical to Russias interests. Source C, a senior Russian financial official said the TRUMP operation should be seen in terms of PUTINS desire to return to Nineteenth Century Great Power politics anchored upon countries' interests rather than the ideals-based international order established after World War Two. S/he had overheard PUTIN talking in this way to close associates on several occasions. &amp;#x200B; 2. In terms of specifics, Source A confided that the Kremlin had been feeding TRUMP and his team valuable intelligence on his opponents, including Democratic presidential candidate Hillary CLINTON, for several years (see more below). This was confirmed by Source D, a close associate of TRUMP who had organized and managed Ins recent trips to Moscow, and who reported, also in June 2016, that this Russian intelligence had been very helpful"". The Kremlins cultivation operation on TRUMP also had comprised offering him various lucrative real estate development deals in Russia, especially in relation to the ongoing World Cup soccer tournament However, so far, for reasons unknown, TRUMP had not taken up any of these. &amp;#x200B; 3. However, there were other aspects to TRUMPs engagement with the Russian authorities. One which had borne fruit for them was to exploit TRUMP'S personal obsessions and sexual perversion in order to obtain suitable kompromat (compromising material) on him. According to Source D, where s/he had been present, TRUMPs (perverted) conduct in Moscow included hiring the presidential suite of the Ritz Carlton Hotel, where he knew President and Mrs OBAMA (whom he hated) had stayed on one of their official trips to Russia, and defiling the bed where they had slept by employing a number of prostitutes to perform a golden showers (urination) show in front of him. The hotel was known to be under FSB control with microphones and concealed cameras in all the main rooms to record anything they wanted to. &amp;#x200B; 4. The Moscow Ritz Carlton episode involving TRUMP reported above was confirmed by Source E, \[REDACTED\] who said s/he and several of the staff were aware of it at the time and subsequently. S/he believed it had happened in 2013. Source E provided an introduction for a company ethnic Russian operative to Source F, a female staffer at the hotel when TRUMP had stayed there, who also confirmed the story. Speaking separately in June 2016, Source B (the former top level Russian intelligence officer) asserted that TRUMPs unorthodox behavior in Russia over the years had provided the authorities there with enough embarrassing material on the now Republican presidential candidate to be able to blackmail him if they so wished. &amp;#x200B; 5. Asked about the Kremlin's reported intelligence feed to TRUMP over recent years and rumours about a Russian dossier of 'kompromat on Hillary CLINTON (being circulated). Source B confirmed the files existence. S/he confided in a trusted compatriot that it had been collated by Department K of the FSB for many years, dating back to her husband Bills presidency, and comprised mainly eavesdropped conversations of various sorts rather than details/evidence of unorthodox or embarrassing behavior. Some of the conversations were from bugged comments CLINTON had made on her various trips to Russia and focused on things she had said which contradicted her current position on various issues. Others were most probably from phone intercepts. &amp;#x200B; 6. Continuing on this theme, Source G, a senior Kremlin official, confided that the CLINTON dossier was controlled exclusively by chief Kremlin spokesman, Dmitriy PESKOV, who was responsible for compiling/handling it on the explicit instructions of PUTIN himself. The dossier however had not as yet been made available abroad, including to TRUMP or his campaign team. At present it was unclear what PUTINs intentions were in this regard. &amp;#x200B; 20 June 2016 &amp;#x200B; \# # # &amp;#x200B; **COMPANY INTELLIGENCE REPORT 2016/086** &amp;#x200B; **RUSSIA/CYBER CRIME: A SYNOPSIS OF RUSSIAN STATE SPONSORED AND OTHER CYBER OFFENSIVE (CRIMINAL) OPERATIONS** &amp;#x200B; **Summary**  Russia has extensive programme of state-sponsored offensive cyber operations. External targets include foreign governments and big corporations, especially banks. FSB leads on cyber within Russian apparatus. Limited success in attacking top foreign targets like G7 governments, security services and IFIs but much more on second tier ones through IT back doors, using corporate and other visitors to Russia  FSB often uses coercion and blackmail to recruit most capable cyber operatives in Russia into its state-sponsored programmes. Heavy use also, both wittingly and unwittingly, of CIS emigres working in western corporations and ethnic Russians employed by neighbouring governments e.g. Latvia  Example cited of successful Russian cyber operation targeting senior Western business visitor. Provided back door into important Western business institutions.  Example given of US citizen of Russian origin approached by FSB and offered incentive of investment in his business when visiting Moscow.  Problems however for Russian authorities themselves in countering local hackers and cyber criminals, operating outside state control. Central Bank claims there were over 20 serious attacks on correspondent accounts held by CBR in 2015, comprising Roubles several billion in fraud &amp;#x200B; **Details** &amp;#x200B; 1. Speaking in June 2016, a number of Russian figures with a detailed knowledge of national cyber crime, both state-sponsored and otherwise, outlined the current situation in this area. A former senior intelligence officer divided Russian state-sponsored offensive cyber operations into four categories (in order of priority): targeting foreign, especially western governments; penetrating leading foreign business corporations, especially banks; domestic monitoring of the elite; and attacking political opponents both at home and abroad. The former intelligence officer reported that the Federal Security Service (FSB) was the lead organization within the Russian state apparatus for cyber operations. &amp;#x200B; 2. In terms of the success of Russian offensive cyber operations to date, a senior government figure reported that there had been only limited success in penetrating the ""first tier"" foreign targets. These comprised western (especially G7 and NATO) governments, security and intelligence services and central banks, and the IFls. To compensate for this shortfall, massive effort had been invested, with much greater success, in attacking the ""secondary targets"", particularly western private banks and the governments of smaller states allied to the West. S/he mentioned Latvia in this regard. Hundreds of agents, either consciously cooperating with the FSB or whose personal and professional IT systems had been unwittingly compromised, were recruited. Many were people who had ethnic and family ties to Russia and/or had been incentivized financially to cooperate. Such people often would receive monetary inducements or contractual favours from the Russian state or its agents in return. This had created difficulties for parts of the Russian state apparatus in obliging/indulging them e.g. the Central Bank of Russia knowingly having to cover up for such agents money laundering operations through the Russian financial system. 3. In terms of the FSBs recruitment of capable cyber operatives to carry out its, ideally deniable, offensive cyber operations, a Russian IT specialist with direct knowledge reported in June 2016 that this was often done using coercion and blackmail. In terms of foreign agents, the FSB was approaching US citizens of Russian (Jewish) origin on business trips to Russia. In one case a US citizen of Russian ethnicity had been visiting Moscow to attract investors in his new information technology program. The FSB clearly knew this and had offered to provide seed capital to this person in return for them being able to access and modify his IP, with a view to targeting priority foreign targets by planting a Trojan virus in the software. The US visitor was told this was common practice. The FSB also had implied significant operational success as a result of installing cheap Russian IT games containing their own malware unwittingly by targets on their PCs and other platforms. &amp;#x200B; 4. In a more advanced and successful FSB operation, an IT operator inside a leading Russian SOE, who previously had been employed on conventional (defensive) IT work there, had been under instruction for the last year to conduct an offensive cyber operation against a foreign director of the company. Although the latter was apparently an infrequent visitor to Russia, the FSB now successfully had penetrated his personal IT and through this had managed to access various important institutions in the West through the back door. &amp;#x200B; 5. In terms of other technical IT platforms, an FSB cyber operative flagged up the Telegram enciphered commercial system as having been of especial concern and therefore heavily targeted by the FSB, not least because it was used frequently by Russian internal political activists and oppositionists. His/her understanding was that the FSB now successfully had cracked this communications software and therefore it was no longer secure to use. &amp;#x200B; 6. The senior Russian government figure cited above also reported that non-state sponsored cyber crime was becoming an increasing problem inside Russia for the government and authorities there. The Central Bank of Russia claimed that in 2015 alone there had been more than 20 attempts at serious cyber embezzlement of money from corresponding accounts held there, comprising several billions Roubles. More generally, s/he understood there were circa 15 major organised crime groups in the country involved in cyber crime, all of which continued to operate largely outside state and FSB control. These included the so-called 'Anunak', Buktrap and Metel organisations. \# # # &amp;#x200B; **COMPANY INTELLIGENCE REPORT 2016/095** &amp;#x200B; **RUSSIA/US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: FURTHER INDICATIONS OF EXTENSIVE CONSPIRACY BETWEEN TRUMPS CAMPAIGN TEAM AND THE KREMLIN** &amp;#x200B; **Summary** &amp;#x200B; \- Further evidence of extensive conspiracy between TRUMPs campaign team and Kremlin, sanctioned at highest levels and involving Russian diplomatic staff based in the US \- TRUMP associate admits Kremlin behind recent appearance of DNC e- mails on WikiLeaks, as means of maintaining plausible deniability \- Agreed exchange of information established in both directions. TRUMPs team using moles within DNC and hackers in the US as well as outside in Russia. PUTIN motivated by fear and hatred of Hillary CLINTON. Russians receiving intel from TRUMPs team on Russian oligarchs and their families in US \- Mechanism for transmitting this intelligence involves pension"" disbursements to Russian emigres living in US as cover, using consular officials in New York, DC and Miami \- Suggestion from source close to TRUMP and MANAFORT that Republican campaign team happy to have Russia as media bogeyman to mask more extensive corrupt business ties to China and other emerging countries &amp;#x200B; **Detail** 1. Speaking in confidence to a compatriot in late July 2016, Source E, an ethnic Russian close associate of Republican US presidential candidate Donald TRUMP, admitted that there was a well-developed conspiracy of co-operation between them and the Russian leadership. This was managed on the TRUMP side by the Republican candidates campaign manager, Paul MANAFORT, who was using foreign policy advisor, Carter PAGE, and others as intermediaries. The two sides had a mutual interest in defeating Democratic presidential candidate Hillary CLINTON, whom President PUTIN apparently both hated and feared. &amp;#x200B; 2. Inter alia, Source E, acknowledged that the Russian regime had been behind the recent leak of embarrassing e-mail messages, emanating from the Democratic National Committee (DNC), to the WikiLeaks platform. The reason for using WikiLeaks was ""plausible deniability and the operation had been conducted with the full knowledge and support of TRUMP and senior members of his campaign team. In return the TRUMP team had agreed to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue and to raise US/NATO defence commitments in the Baltics and Eastern Europe to deflect attention away from Ukraine, a priority for PUTIN who needed to cauterise the subject. &amp;#x200B; 3. In the wider context of TRUMP campaign/Kremlin co-operation, Source E claimed that the intelligence network being used against CLINTON comprised three elements. Firstly there were agents/facilitators within the Democratic Party structure itself; secondly Russian emigre and associated offensive cyber operators based in the US; and thirdly, state-sponsored cyber operatives working in Russia. All three elements had played an important role to date. On the mechanism for rewarding relevant assets based in the US, and effecting a two-way flow of intelligence and other useful information, Source E claimed that Russian diplomatic staff in key cities such as New York, Washington DC and Miami were using the emigre pension distribution system as cover. The operation therefore depended on key people in the US Russian emigre community for its success. Tens of thousands of dollars were involved. &amp;#x200B; 4. In terms of the intelligence flow from the TRUMP team to Russia, Source E reported that much of this concerned the activities of business oligarchs and their families activities and assets in the US, with which PUTIN and the Kremlin seemed preoccupied. &amp;#x200B; 5. Commenting on the negative media publicity surrounding alleged Russian interference in the US election campaign in support of TRUMP, Source E said he understood that the Republican candidate and his team were relatively relaxed about this because it deflected media and the Democrats' attention away from TRUMP's business dealings in China and other emerging markets. Unlike in Russia, these were substantial and involved the payment of large bribes and kickbacks which, were they to become public, would be potentially very damaging to their campaign. &amp;#x200B; 6. Finally, regarding TRUMPs claimed minimal investment profile in Russia, a separate source with direct knowledge said this had not been for want of trying. TRUMP's previous efforts had included exploring the real estate sector in St Petersburg as well as Moscow but in the end TRUMP had had to settle for the use of extensive sexual services there from local prostitutes rather than business success. &amp;#x200B; \# # # **COMPANY INTELLIGENCE REPORT 2016/94** &amp;#x200B; **RUSSIA: SECRET KREMLIN MEETINGS ATTENDED BY TRUMP ADVISOR, CARTER PAGE IN MOSCOW (JULY 2016)** &amp;#x200B; **Summary** &amp;#x200B; \- TRUMP advisor Carter PAGE holds secret meetings in Moscow with SECHIN and senior Kremlin Internal Affairs official, DIVYEKIN &amp;#x200B; \- SECHIN raises issues of future bilateral US-Russia energy co-operation and associated lifting of western sanctions against Russia over Ukraine. PAGE non-committal in response &amp;#x200B; \- DIVEYKIN discusses release of Russian dossier of kompromat on TRUMPs opponent, Hillary CLINTON, but also hints at Kremlin possession of such material on TRUMP &amp;#x200B; **Detail** &amp;#x200B; 1. Speaking in July 2016, a Russian source close to Rosneft President, PUTIN close associate and US-sanctioned individual, Igor SECHIN, confided the details of a recent secret meeting between him and visiting Foreign Affairs Advisor to Republican presidential candidate Donald TRUMP, Carter PAGE. &amp;#x200B; 2. According to SECHINs associate, the Rosneft President \[CEO) had raised with PAGE the issues of future bilateral energy cooperation and prospects for an associated move to lift Ukraine-related western sanctions against Russia. PAGE had reacted positively to this demarche by SECHIN but had been generally non-committal in response. &amp;#x200B; 3. Speaking separately, also in July 2016, an official close to Presidential Administration Head, S. IVANOV, confided in a compatriot that a senior colleague in the Internal Political Department of the PA, DIVYEKIN (nfd) also had met secretly with PAGE on his recent visit. Their agenda had included DIVEYKIN raising a dossier of 'kompromat' the Kremlin possessed on TRUMP's Democratic presidential rival, Hillary CLINTON, and its possible release to the Republican's campaign team. &amp;#x200B; 4. However, the Kremlin official close to S. IVANOV added that s/he believed DIVEYKIN also had hinted (or indicated more strongly) that the Russian leadership also had 'kompromat' on TRUMP which the latter should bear in mind in his dealings with them. &amp;#x200B; 19 July 2016 &amp;#x200B; \# # # &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **COMPANY INTELLIGENCE REPORT 2016/097** &amp;#x200B; **RUSSIA-US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: KREMLIN CONCERN THAT POLITICAL FALLOUT FROM DNC E-MAIL HACKING AFFAIR SPIRALLING OUT OF CONTROL** &amp;#x200B; **Summary** &amp;#x200B; \- Kremlin concerned that political fallout from DNC e-mail hacking operation is spiralling out of control. Extreme nervousness among TRUMP's associates as result of negative media attention/accusations \- Russians meanwhile keen to cool situation and maintain 'plausible deniability' of existing /ongoing pro-TRUMP and anti-CLINTON operations. Therefore unlikely to be any ratcheting up offensive plays in immediate future \- Source close to TRUMP campaign however confirms regular exchange with Kremlin has existed for at least 8 years, including intelligence fed back to Russia on oligarchs' activities in US \- Russians apparently have promised not to use 'kompromat' they hold on TRUMP as leverage, given high levels of voluntary co-operation forthcoming from his team &amp;#x200B; **Detail** 1. Speaking in confidence to a trusted associate in late July 2016, a Russian emigre figure close to the Republican US presidential candidate Donald TRUMP's campaign team commented on the fallout from publicity surrounding the Democratic National Committee (DNC) e-mail hacking scandal. The emigre said there was a high level of anxiety within the TRUMP team as a result of various accusations levelled against them and indications from the Kremlin that President PUTIN and others in the leadership thought things had gone too far now and risked spiralling out of control. &amp;#x200B; 2. Continuing on this theme, the emigre associate of TRUMP opined that the Kremlin wanted the situation to calm but for 'plausible deniability' to be maintained concerning its (extensive) pro-TRUMP and anti-CLINTON operations. S/he therefore judged that it was unlikely these would be ratcheted up, at least for the time being. &amp;#x200B; 3. However, in terms of established operational liaison between the TRUMP team and the Kremlin, the migr confirmed that an intelligence exchange had been running between them for at least 8 years. Within this context PUTIN'S priority requirement had been for intelligence on the activities, business and otherwise, in the US of leading Russian oligarchs and their families. TRUMP and his associates duly had obtained and supplied the Kremlin with this information. &amp;#x200B; 4. Finally the migr said s/he understood the Kremlin had more intelligence on CLINTON and her campaign but he did nots know the details or when or when or if it would be released. As far as 'kompromat' (compromising information) on TRUMP were concerned, although there was plenty of this, he understood the Kremlin had given its word that it would not be deployed against the Republican presidential candidate given how helpful and co-operative his team had been over several years, and particularly of late. &amp;#x200B; 30 July 2016 &amp;#x200B; \# # # &amp;#x200B; **COMPANY INTELLIGENCE REPORT 2016/100** &amp;#x200B; **RUSSIA/USA: GROWING BACKLASH IN KREMLIN TO DNC HACKING AND TRUMP SUPPORT OPERATIONS** &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **Summary** &amp;#x200B; \- Head of PA IVANOV laments Russian intervention in US presidential election and black PR against CLINTON and the DNC. Vows not to supply intelligence to Kremlin PR operatives again.

Refusing to support or help cover up after PESKOV \- Talk now in Kremlin of TRUMP withdrawing from presidential race altogether, but this still largely wishful thinking by more liberal elements in Moscow &amp;#x200B; **Detail** &amp;#x200B; 1. Speaking in early August 2016, two well-placed and established Kremlin sources outlined the divisions and backlash in Moscow arising from the leaking of Democratic National Committee (DNC) e-mails and the wider pro-TRUMP operation being conducted in the US. Head of Presidential Administration, Sergei IVANOV, was angry at the recent turn of events. He believed the Kremlin ""team"" involved, led by presidential spokesman Dmitriy PESKOV, had gone too far in interfering in foreign affairs with their ""elephant in a china shop black PR"". IVANOV claimed always to have opposed the handling and exploitation of intelligence by this PR ""team"". Following the backlash against such foreign interference in US politics, IVANOV was advocating that the only sensible course of action now for the Russian leadership was to ""sit tight and deny everything"". &amp;#x200B; 2. Continuing on this theme the source close to IVANOV reported that PESKOV now was ""scared shitless"" that he would be scapegoated by PUTIN and the Kremlin and held responsible for the backlash against Russian political interference in the US election. IVANOV was determined to stop PESKOV playing an independent role in relation to the US going forward and the source fully expected the presidential spokesman now to lay low. PESKOV s position was not helped by a botched attempt by him also to interfere in the recent failed coup in Turkey from a government relations (GR) perspective (no further details\]. &amp;#x200B; 3. The extent of disquiet and division within Moscow caused by the backlash against Russian interference in the US election was underlined by a second source, close to premier Dmitriy MEDVEDEV (DAM\]. S/he said the Russian prime minister and his colleagues wanted to have good relations with the US, regardless of who was in power there, and not least so as to be able to travel there in future, either officially or privately. They were openly refusing to cover up for PESKOV and others involved in the DNC/TRUMP operations or to support his counter-attack of allegations against the USG for its alleged hacking of the Russian government and state agencies. &amp;#x200B; 4. According to the first source, close to IVANOV, there had been talk in the Kremlin of TRUMP being forced to withdraw from the presidential race altogether as a result of recent events, ostensibly on grounds of his psychological state and unsuitability for high office. This might not be so bad for Russia in the circumstances but in the view of the source, it remained largely wishful thinking on the part of those in the regime opposed to PESKOV and his ""botched operations, at least for the time being. &amp;#x200B; 5 August 2016 &amp;#x200B; \# # # &amp;#x200B; **COMPANY INTELLIGENCE REPORT 2016/101** &amp;#x200B; **RUSSIA/US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: SENIOR KREMLIN FIGURE OUTLINES EVOLVING RUSSIAN TACTICS IN** **PRO-TRUMP, ANTI-CLINTON OPERATION** &amp;#x200B; **Summary** &amp;#x200B; \- Head of PA, IVANOV assesses Kremlin intervention in US presidential election and outlines leadership thinking on operational way forward \- No new leaks envisaged, as too politically risky, but rather further exploitation of (WikiLeaks) material already disseminated to exacerbate divisions.

Speaking in confidence to a close colleague in early August 2016, Head of the Russian Presidential Administration (PA), Sergei IVANOV, assessed the impact and results of Kremlin intervention in the US presidential election to date. Although most commentators believed that the Kremlin was behind the leaked DNC/CLINTON e-mails, this remained technically deniable. Therefore the Russians would not risk their position for the time being with new leaked material, even to a third party like WikiLeaks. Rather the tactics would be to spread rumours and misinformation about the content of what already had been leaked and make up new content. &amp;#x200B; 2. Continuing on this theme, IVANOV said that the audience to be targeted by such operations was the educated youth in America as the PA assessed that there was still a chance they could be persuaded to vote for Republican candidate Donald TRUMP as a protest against the Washington establishment (in the form of Democratic candidate Hillary CLINTON). The hope was that even if she won, as a result of this CLINTON in power would be bogged down in working for internal reconciliation in the US, rather than being able to focus on foreign policy which would damage Russia's interests.This also should give President PUTIN more room for manoeuvre in the run-up to Russia's own presidential election in 2018. &amp;#x200B; 3. IVANOV reported that although the Kremlin had underestimated the strength of US media and liberal reaction to the DNC hack and TRUMP's links to Russia, PUTIN was generally satisfied with the progress of the anti-CLINTON operation to date. He recently had had a drink with PUTIN to mark this. In IVANOV's view, the US had tried to divide the Russian elite with sanctions but failed, whilst they, by contrast, had succeeded in splitting the US hawks inimical to Russia and the Washington elite more generally, half of whom had refused to endorse any presidential candidate as a result of Russian intervention. &amp;#x200B; 4. Speaking separately, also in early August 2016, a Kremlin official involved in US relations commented on aspects of the Russian operation to date. Its goals had been threefold - asking sympathetic US actors how Moscow could help them; gathering relevant intelligence; and creating and disseminating compromising information ('kompromat'). This had involved the Kremlin supporting various US political figures including funding indirectly their recent visits to Moscow. S/he named a delegation from Lyndon LAROUCHE; presidential candidate Jill STEIN of the Green Party; TRUMP foreign policy adviser Carter PAGE; and former DIA Director Michael Flynn, in this regard and as successful in terms of perceived outcomes. &amp;#x200B; 10 August 2016 \# # # **COMPANY INTELLIGENCE REPORT 2016/102** &amp;#x200B; **RUSSIA/US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: REACTION IN TRUMP CAMP TO RECENT NEGATIVE PUBLICITY ABOUT** **RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE AND LIKELY RESULTING TACTICS GOING FORWARD** &amp;#x200B; **Summary** &amp;#x200B; \- TRUMP campaign insider reports recent DNC e-mail leaks were aimed at switching SANDERS (protest) voters away from CLINTON and over to TRUMP \- Admits Republican campaign underestimated resulting negative reaction from US liberals, elite and media and forced to change course as result \- Need now to turn tables on CLINTON'S use of PUTIN as bogeyman in election, although some resentment at Russian president's perceived attempt to undermine USG and system over and above swinging presidentiaI election &amp;#x200B; **Detail** &amp;#x200B; 1. Speaking in confidence on 9 August 2016, an ethnic Russian associate of Republican US presidential candidate Donald TRUMP discussed the reaction inside his camp, and revised tactics therein resulting from recent negative publicity concerning Moscow's clandestine involvement in the campaign. TRUMP's associate reported that the aim of Ieaking the DNC e-maiIs to WikiLeaks during the Democratic Convention had been to swing supporters of Bernie SANDERS away from Hillary CLINTON and across to TRUMP. These voters were perceived as activist and anti -status quo and anti-establishment and in that regard sharing many features with the TRUMP campaign, including a visceral dislike of Hillary CLINTON. This objective had been conceived and promoted, inter alia, by TRUMP's foreign policy adviser Carter PAGE who had discussed it directly with the ethnic Russian associate. &amp;#x200B; 2. Continuing on this theme, the ethnic Russian associate-of TRUMP assessed that the problem was that the TRUMP campaign had underestimated the strength of the negative reaction from liberals and especially the conservative elite to Russian interference. This was forcing a rethink and a likely change of tactics. The main objective in the short term was to check Democratic candidate Hillary CLINTON'S successful exploitation of the PUTIN as bogeyman/Russian interference story to tarnish TRUMP and bolster her own (patriotic) credentials.The TRUMP campaign was focusing on tapping into support in the American television media to achieve this, as they reckoned this resource had been underused by them to date. &amp;#x200B; 3. However, TRUMP's associate also admitted that there was a fair amount of anger and resentment within the Republican candidate's team at what was perceived by PUTIN as going beyond the objective of weakening CLINTON and bolstering TRUMP, by attempting to exploit the situation to undermine the US government and democratic system more generally. It was unclear at present how this aspect of the situation would play out in the weeks to come. &amp;#x200B; 10 August 2016 \# # # &amp;#x200B; **COMPANY INTELLIGENCE REPORT 2016/136** &amp;#x200B; **RUSSIA/US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: FURTHER DETAILS OF TRUMP LAWYER COHEN'S SECRET LIAISON WITH THE KREMLIN** &amp;#x200B; **Summary** &amp;#x200B; \- Kremlin insider reports TRUMP lawyer COHEN's secret meeting/s with Kremlin officials in August 2016 was/were held in Prague \- Russian parastatal organisation Rossotrudnichestvo used as cover for this liaison and premises in Czech capital may have been used for the meeting/s \- Pro-PUTIN leading Duma figure, KOSACHEV, reportedly involved as ""plausibly deniable"" facilitator and may have participated in the August meeting/s with COHEN &amp;#x200B; **Detail** &amp;#x200B; 1. Speaking to a compatriot and friend on 19 October 2016, a Kremlin insider provided further details of reported clandestine meeting/s between Republican presidential candidate, Donald TRUMP'S lawyer Michael COHEN and Kremlin representatives in August 2016. Although the communication between them had to be cryptic for security reasons, the Kremlin insider clearly indicated to his/her friend that the reported contact/s took place in Prague, Czech Republic. &amp;#x200B; 2. Continuing on this theme, the Kremlin insider highlighted the importance of the Russian parastatal organisation, Rossotrudnichestvo, in this contact between TRUMP campaign representative/s and Kremlin officials. Rossotrudnichestvo was being used as cover for thisrelationship and its office in Prague may well have been used to host the COHEN / Russian Presidential Administration (PA) meeting/s. It was considered a ""plausibly deniable"" vehicle for this, whilst remaining entirely under Kremlin control. &amp;#x200B; 3. The Kremlin insider went on to identify leading pro-PUTIN Duma figure, Konstantin KOSACHEV (Head of the Foreign Relations Committee) as an important figure in the TRUMP campaign-Kremlin liaison operation. KOSACHEV, also ""plausibly deniable"" being part of the Russian legislature rather than executive, had facilitated the contact in Prague and by implication, may have attended the meeting/s with COHEN there in August. &amp;#x200B; **Company Comment** &amp;#x200B; We reported previously, in our Company Intelligence Report 2016/135 of 19 October 2016 from the same source, that COHEN met officials from the PA Legal Department clandestinely in an EU country in August 2016. This was in order to clean up the mess left behind by western media revelations of TRUMP ex-campaign manager MANAFORT's corrupt relationship with the former pro-Russian YANUKOVYCH regime in Ukraine and TRUMP foreign policy advisor, Carter PAGE'S secret meetings in Moscow with senior regime figures in July 2016. According to the Kremlin advisor, these meeting/s were originally scheduled for COHEN in Moscow but shifted to what was considered an operationally ""soft"" EU country when it was judged too compromising for him to travel to the Russian capital. &amp;#x200B; 20 October 2016 &amp;#x200B; \# # # &amp;#x200B; **COMPANY INTELLIGENCE REPORT 2016/105** &amp;#x200B; **RUSSIA/UKRAINE: THE DEMISE OF TRUMPS CAMPAIGN MANAGER PAUL MANAFORT** &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **Summary** &amp;#x200B; \- Ex-Ukrainian President YANUKOVYCH confides directly to PUTIN that he authorised kick-back payments to MANAFORT, as alleged in western media.

Ukraine revelations played part but others wanted MANAFORT out for various reasons, especially LEWANDOWSKI who remains influential &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **Detail** &amp;#x200B; 1. Speaking in late August 2016, in the immediate aftermath of Paul MANAFORTs resignation as campaign manager for US Republican presidential candidate Donald TRUMP, a well-placed Russian figure reported on a recent meeting between President PUTIN and ex-President YANUKOVYCH of Ukraine. This had been held in secret on 15 August near Volgograd, Russia and the western media revelations about MANAFORT and Ukraine had featured prominently on the agenda. YANUKOVYCH had confided in PUTIN that he did authorise and order substantial kick-back payments to MANAFORT as alleged but sought to reassure him that there was no documentary trail left behind which could provide clear evidence of this. &amp;#x200B; 2. Given YANUKOVYCH'S (unimpressive) record in covering up his own corrupt tracks in the past, PUTIN and others in the Russian leadership were sceptical about the ex-Ukrainian presidents reassurances on this as relating to MANAFORT. They therefore still feared the scandal had legs, especially as MANAFORT had been commercially active in Ukraine right up to the time (in March 2016) when he joined TRUMP's campaign team. For them it therefore remained a point of potential political vulnerability and embarrassment. &amp;#x200B; 3. Speaking separately, also in late August 2016, an American political figure associated with Donald TRUMP and his campaign outlined the reasons behind MANAFORTs recent demise. S/he said it was true that the Ukraine corruption revelations had played a part in this but also, several senior players close to TRUMP had wanted MANAFORT out, primarily to loosen his control on strategy and policy formulation. Of particular importance in this regard was MANAFORT's predecessor as campaign manager, Corey LEWANDOWSKI, who hated MANAFORT personally and remained close to TRUMP with whom he discussed the presidential campaign on a regular basis. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; 22 August 2016 &amp;#x200B; \# # # &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

If you signed up already, check the spam folder just in case * If youd like to donate a dollar a month, Id appreciate it: [patreon](URL Recaps will continue regardless. On to the review... &amp;nbsp; ##Week of Nov 18 - 24: What We Learned in the Russia Probe &amp;nbsp; #Mueller investigation **Major update?** Today, November 26th, Mueller is [expected](URL to file a status report updating the judge on Manaforts cooperation. Muellers team did not offer any additional details, but experts have speculated that Manafort could be a major witness or co-conspirator in a brand new case, meaning the court will have to push his sentencing way back. &amp;nbsp; **Corsi cooperation?** Roger Stones associate Jerome Corsi [told the AP](URL that he has been negotiating a plea deal with Muellers team. He declined to provide any further details. Two weeks ago Corsi told the media he anticipated Mueller would indict him for lying to investigators, while also maintaining his innocence on the charges. &amp;nbsp; **Papadopoulos sentence.** Today, November 26th, George Papadopoulos is [set to surrender himself](URL to jail to serve 14 days for lying to federal investigators. A last minute ruling by the judge yesterday struck down Papadopoulos attempt to avoid jail. His new lawyers asked the judge to postpone his sentence until after Andrew Millers case challenging Muellers appointment is resolved. The judge sided with Mueller. * Mueller [responded](URL to Papadopoulos request by pointing to inconsistencies in Papadopoulos statements, especially his tweets. Despite expressing regret for his actions at his sentencing, Papadopoulos later tweeted that the FBIs investigation was ""the biggest case of entrapment and claiming to have been framed. Prosecutors wrote that his public statements following his sentencing indicate that this motion is being made for the 'purpose of delay.'"" * Papadopoulos former lawyers have [spoken out](URL on why they withdrew from the case, stating it was due to his contradicting statements. We felt it best to withdraw from the case based on Georges public statements that he gave contrary to the facts in the case. We know that George and his wife are interested in a pardon but we could not in good conscience support their method of attempting to get a pardon. George was not communicating with us so we were unable to advise him properly...We felt that he should stop making public statements, even though it is his right to do so. &amp;nbsp; **Failed interview.** The [AP reported](URL that Trump had scheduled an interview with Mueller for January 27, 2018 but backed out as the date approached. Trumps lawyers balked at the topics Mueller wanted to discuss and sent a searing letter disputing Muellers authority to question the president. * At first Trump insisted he wanted to sit for an interview with Mueller. He even told one confidant last spring he was frustrated his lawyers didnt believe he should do it and snapped that he didnt understand what was taking so long, according to one Republican in contact with the White House. After Rudy Giuliani joined Trumps legal team, however, the strategy shifted to dragging out the interview drama for months and using that time to ratchet up attacks on Muellers credibility. &amp;nbsp; **Return of Giuliani.** Speaking of Giuliani, now that the midterms are over he has returned to the spotlight. In an [interview with Axios](URL Giuliani re-asserted that Trump would fight any subpoena from Mueller, and Giuliani predicted Mueller would not win a legal battle if he did that. About the Muellers questions for Trump, Giuliani said it looked like a law school exam... one big long group of questions, that were multi-part questions. &amp;nbsp; **Obstruction.** We got a glimpse into the obstruction of justice aspect of Muellers investigation when the New York Times and CNN [reported](URL last week that Trump sought to direct the DOJ to prosecute Hillary Clinton and James Comey. Specifically, while it is inappropriate to direct prosecution of a political rival like Clinton, the order relating to Comey is most likely to amount to criminal behavior because he is a witness in Muellers investigation. * Daily Beast: Obstruction of justice occurs when someone acts with a corrupt intent to interfere with an official proceeding, such as a grand jury investigation. An essential element of obstruction of justice is the persons intent to act corruptly. &amp;nbsp; #More Russian Connections **Butina update.** Lawyers for Maria Butina, alleged Russian agent, asked a judge to [dismiss charges](URL against her as unconstitutional. They argue that the law barring a person from acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government is unconstitutionally vague, and fails to define what types of acts are covered or who qualifies as an official. Prosecutors have until Friday, November 30th to respond to the dismissal motion. &amp;nbsp; **Browder charges.** Russia [has accused](URL Bill Browder of leading an international criminal group and plans on renewing their efforts to seek his arrest. Browder was instrumental in the creation of the Magnitsky Act and is an outspoken critic of the Kremlin. Russian prosecutors said last week that they hope Trumps DOJ will be more helpful than Obamas and allow them to pursue charges against Browder. * The allegations [against Browder] are the same as those made by a Kremlin-linked lawyer at a controversial 2016 meeting with top Trump campaign officials at Trump Tower. * When Trump and Putin met in Helsinki over the summer, Putin made what Trump hailed as an incredible offer. Putin said Russia would help the U.S. investigate alleged Russian election meddling in return for the right to question a number of U.S. citizens as well as Browder over an alleged $1.5 billion tax evasion. &amp;nbsp; **GRU death.** Igor Korobov, the chief of Russias military intelligence agency, [died last week](URL after a serious and long illness. He was under US sanctions for significant malicious cyber-enabled activities and was likely to also be sanctioned for the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal. Korobov is the second GRU chief to die in two years; his predecessor died at age 58 under unclear circumstances. &amp;nbsp; **Nail in the collusion coffin?** Two weeks ago, a US District Judge [ruled](URL that an independently lawful act can become a crime when it is performed with the intent to impair or obstruct the lawful function of any part of government. This means that collusion itself can be a crime if its for the purpose of pulling a fast one on a department of the federal government. Thus, the argument that collusion is not a crime might not hold up well in court, and Mueller knows this. &amp;nbsp; **Russian mafia.** If you haven't read any interviews with Craig Unger, author of ""House of Trump, House of Putin,"" another was [published](URL last week detailing the past three decades of Trumps ties to the Russian mafia. &amp;nbsp; #Congress/States **HPSCI plans.** The Democratic-led House Intelligence Committee [is hiring](URL money-laundering and forensic accounting experts to prepare for investigations into Donald Trump. Adam Schiff, likely to be chairman of the committee, has made it known he is interested in the intersection of financial crimes and intelligence threats, especially those involving Deutsche Bank. * Daily Beast: When other lenders were loath to lend money to Trump in the 1990s, Deutsche Bank stepped up and spotted him tons of cash. The president may still owe the bank up to $175 million, according to MarketWatch. &amp;nbsp; **Comey subpoenaed.** Rep. Bob Goodlatte, in one of his acts as an elected official, [subpoenaed](URL former FBI chief James Comey and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch to testify privately before congress on December 3rd and 4th. Comey responded via tweet, stating he will resist a closed door interview but will be happy to sit in the light and answer all questions. &amp;nbsp; **Challenging Whitaker.** Senate Democrats Blumenthal, Whitehouse, and Hirono have [filed a suit](URL to block Matt Whitaker from serving as acting attorney general, arguing his appointment violates the Appointments Clause of the constitution because Whitaker was not Senate confirmed. The lawsuit faces a big hurdle, though, before it can advance: the plaintiffs will have to show they have standing -- meaning, that his appointment violated their rights. * The three Democratic senators can argue Whitakers appointment violated their constitutional right to advise and consent the president on cabinet-level appointments, but its a hotly debated position and one not guaranteed to succeed. &amp;nbsp; **More challenges.** The senators join Maryland and a Washington DC lawyer in suing to stop Whitakers appointment. Additionally, Rep. Adam Schiff [told CNN](URL ""We are going to bring Whitaker before the Congress, assuming he's still in his position at the time when Democrats take over."" He continued, ""We may bring him in whether he's in that position or not to find out the answers to these questions."" * Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh, currently fighting the Trump administration over the Affordable Care Act healthcare law, is [asking the judge](URL in the case to declare Whitakers appointment illegal. Frosh says there are two legal grounds to challenge: (1) Rosenstein, as DOJs number 2 official, should have succeeded Sessions, (2) Whitaker was not confirmed by the Senate. * In a guns rights case pending before the Supreme Court, lead lawyer Tom Goldstein is [asking the justices](URL to rule that Rod Rosenstein is the rightful Attorney General, again using the Appointments Clause. The case was originally against Sessions, but now cannot proceed until the identity of his successor is confirmed by the justices. &amp;nbsp; #Other **Charity suit.** A New York state judge has sided with the NY attorney general against Trump, [allowing the case](URL against him and his family to continue. The lawsuit alleges that Donald Trump Sr., Don Jr., Eric Trump, and Ivanka Trump violated charity laws when they used the Trump Foundation to pay off personal and campaign debts. * [CNBC](URL Scarpulla [the judge] noted that the defendants ""have failed to cite a single case in which any court has dismissed a civil action against a sitting president on Supremacy Clause grounds, where, as here, the action is based on the president's unofficial acts."" ------------------------------------------------------------- #Too long; didnt read section *Today, November 26th, Mueller is expected to file a status report updating the judge on Manaforts cooperation. Also today George Papadopoulos is supposed to surrender himself to jail to serve 14 days for lying to federal investigators. However, Papadopoulos new lawyers asked the judge to postpone his sentence until after Andrew Millers case challenging Muellers appointment is resolved. Roger Stones associate Jerome Corsi has been negotiating a plea deal with Muellers team. Trump had scheduled an interview with Mueller for January 27, 2018, but backed out upon seeing the list of questions Mueller planned on asking. Two weeks ago, a US District judge ruled that collusion can be a crime. Last week, it was reported that Trump sought to direct the DOJ to prosecute Hillary Clinton and James Comey, in what might amount to further evidence of obstruction of justice.* *Lawyers for Maria Butina, alleged Russian agent, asked a judge to dismiss charges against her as unconstitutional. Russian officials re-asserted charges against Kremlin-critic Bill Browder and stated they are hopeful Trumps administration will be more helpful in pursuing him than Obamas was. Igor Korobov, the chief of Russias military intelligence agency, died last week after a serious and long illness. He is the second chief to die in two years.* *The Democratic-led House Intelligence Committee is hiring money-laundering and forensic accounting experts to prepare for investigations into Donald Trump. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, in one of his acts as an elected official, subpoenaed former FBI chief James Comey and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch to testify privately before Congress; Comey refuses to testify unless it is public. Senate Democrats Blumenthal, Whitehouse, and Hirono have filed a suit to block Matt Whitaker from serving as acting attorney general, joining lawsuits by Maryland and a challenge in a guns rights case before SCOTUS. A New York state judge has sided with the NY attorney general against Trump, allowing the case against him and his family for violating charity laws to continue.* "

On to the review... &amp;nbsp; ##Week of Sept 9 - 15: What We Learned in the Russia Probe &amp;nbsp; #Mueller investigation **Money moving.** Expanding upon an earlier piece, the [Daily Beast revealed](URL new details about suspicious financial transactions that took place around the Trump Tower meeting between the men who planned it. Muellers team is now investigating the matter. * The broad stroke of the story is Aras Agalarov and Irakly Ike Kaveladze, an employee of Agalarov who was once investigated for money laundering, moved $3.3 million between their various accounts starting on June 3rd, 2016 - the same day Don Jr. accepted the meeting to take place six days later. An additional $20 million was flagged as suspicious, as well. I recommend everyone read the whole article for the details. &amp;nbsp; **Declassification.** On Monday, [Trump directed](URL the FBI and DOJ to declassify and release sensitive documents related to the Russia probe, including parts of the FISA warrant to surveil Carter Page, all reports of interviews with Bruce Ohr prepared in connection with the Russia investigations, and all text messages relating to the Russia investigation, without redaction, of James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and Bruce Ohr. * The fact that Trump ordered select parts of the FISA application to be released unredacted, specifically pages 10-12 and 17-34, [hints](URL that those pages contain information that he can use to try to discredit the investigation. Trump told [The Hill TV](URL he was motivated to direct the release by so many people that I respect: the great Lou Dobbs, the great Sean Hannity, the wonderful, great Jeanine Pirro. * Despite Trump ordering the immediate declassification of these materials, the DOJ, FBI, and Office of the Director of National Intelligence [stated](URL they are first going through a methodical declassification review in which certain information will still be redacted to keep information secret - for example, to protect sources. * On Friday, Trump [softened](URL his directive, saying Justice Department officials and others had persuaded him not to declassify the information for the time being. He sent [two tweets](URL stating he had asked the DOJs Inspector General to review the documents and determine what, if anything, can be released. * Trump [revealed](URL in an interview with Sean Hannity that key allies are alarmed that the release of the document could reveal highly sensitive information implicating their own intelligence networks, particularly those concerning Russia. The NYT reported the British were one of nations that objected to the declassification. &amp;nbsp; **Cohen update.** ABC News [reported](URL Michael Cohen has spent hours providing interviews to Muellers team across multiple sessions. They covered topics including Trumps connections with Russia, both financial and business, and any conversations about pardoning Cohen. ABC notes he has also spoken with Manhattan federal prosecutors and is cooperating in New York state investigations of the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization. **Assanges escape.** The Guardian [revealed](URL Russian diplomats hatched a plan to assist Julian Assange in fleeing the U.K. and taking refuge in Russia, where he would be safe from extradition to the U.S. The plan involved giving Assange diplomatic documents so that Ecuador would be able to claim he enjoyed diplomatic immunity. As part of the operation, Assange was to be collected from the embassy in a diplomatic vehicle. * Earlier in the week, the [AP reported](URL on a collection of leaked Wikileaks emails, chat logs, records, and other documents. A November 30, 2010 letter shows Assange tried to obtain a visa from Russia, the day after Wikileaks released the first batch of U.S. State Department files. &amp;nbsp; **Legal fees.** Former Trump lawyer John Dowd [tried to pay](URL the legal fees of Paul Manafort and Rich Gates, in what could appear to be an attempt to tamper with witnesses and obstruct justice. Dowd at first wanted to divert money from the White House legal defense fund but was dissuaded by aides. He later solicited donors for money and pledged $25,000 of his own. &amp;nbsp; **Grand jury.** Jerome Corsi, bureau chief of Infowars and associate of Roger Stone, [testified](URL before Muellers grand jury in DC Friday. Corsi is involved in Muellers probe in part because he appeared to have advance knowledge of Wikileaks hacked information. &amp;nbsp; **Stone.** Roger Stone appeared at a pro-Trump event in West Palm Beach [where he proclaimed](URL  I will never roll on Donald Trump. Michael Cohen I am not. He added, hell never turn on Trump even if Mueller tries to frame me for some extraneous crime. * At least ten associates of Roger Stone have been contacted by Muellers team. Stone said, The FBI tried to question my cleaning lady and FBI agents have been seen sifting through my garbage. Heres what I can tell you: they will find no evidence of Russian collusionThey will find no evidence of Wikileaks collaboration. &amp;nbsp; #More Russian Connections **Trump whisperer.** Journalist Greg Millers new Trump book, [The Apprentice](URL contains a worrying, but not surprising, tidbit: Putin would tell Trump in phone conversations that the deep state was keeping them apart and trying to ruin their relationship. The following is an [excerpt](URL &gt;In phone conversations with Trump, Putin would whisper conspiratorially, telling the U.S. president that it wasnt their fault that they could not consummate the relationship that each had sought. Instead, Putin sought to reinforce Trumps belief that he was being undermined by a secret government cabal, a bureaucratic deep state. &gt;Its not us. We get it, Putin would tell Trump, according to White House aides. Its the subordinates fighting against our friendship. &amp;nbsp; **Jail visitors.** Russian officials have [been visiting](URL Maria Butina and Yevgeniy Nikulin, two Russian nationals held in U.S. jails, raising questions about whether the Kremlin is trying to interfere in the high-profile cases of alleged cyber and political meddling. Butina is accused of being a Russian spy and Nikulin is a Russian hacker extradited from the Czech Republic. * Butina has been visited six times in the past 2 months and Nikulin has been visited multiple times by Russian officials. * They are clearly worried and want to make sure that the people are not talking, and put pressure to release them, said John Sipher, who spent 28 years in the CIA serving in Moscow and running the agencys Russia operations. &amp;nbsp; **N.K. sanctions.** The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, called an emergency meeting of the security council to [accuse Russia](URL of cheating on sanctions against North Korea by helping the country acquire oil and coal. She further accused Russia of threatening to block an independent report on the status of North Korean sanctions unless a list of Russian violations was excised. Russia denies both charges. &amp;nbsp; **Bungled sanctions.** The Daily Beast [reported](URL that the Trump administration did not initially intend to sanction Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska and his aluminum company Rusal. The sanctions reportedly came from a mistaken statement by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin while under oath before Congress. Mnuchin stated his department would be applying sanctions, when there was no plan to do so. Mnuchins slip-up forced Treasury officials to scramble to come up with a plan that would match the secretarys under-oath statement. * Daily Beast: Treasury broke protocol and did not coordinate closely with other departments to properly scrutinize Deripaska and evaluate the impact of the sanctionswhich roiled global markets and caused aluminum prices to skyrocket, mainly affecting U.S. partners in Europe. * This new information may explain why Mnuchin is [now considering](URL lifting the sanctions on Rusal. &amp;nbsp; **FCC interference.** The New York Times [sued the FCC](URL because the agency has refused to release records that may reveal Russian interference in the net neutrality repeal proceeding.

I tried to strip the recap down to the most important points - so if you need the main points in about 10 sentences, skip to the end. Im including election security issues because of fears that Russian actors (among others) can exploit vulnerabilities. **Housekeeping:** * Shameless plug: My [spreadsheet](URL of *all* departures from the Trump administration (385 so far). [My twitter](URL * Theres a mailing list for notifications when this review is posted plus a link. To be added, send me PM with your email address. If you signed up already, check the spam folder just in case * If youd like to donate a dollar a month, Id appreciate it: [patreon](URL Recaps will continue regardless. On to the review... &amp;nbsp; ##Week of Sept 16 - 22: What We Learned in the Russia Probe &amp;nbsp; #Mueller investigation **Money moving.** Expanding upon an earlier piece, the [Daily Beast revealed](URL new details about suspicious financial transactions that took place around the Trump Tower meeting between the men who planned it. Muellers team is now investigating the matter. * The broad stroke of the story is Aras Agalarov and Irakly Ike Kaveladze, an employee of Agalarov who was once investigated for money laundering, moved $3.3 million between their various accounts starting on June 3rd, 2016 - the same day Don Jr. accepted the meeting to take place six days later. An additional $20 million was flagged as suspicious, as well. I recommend everyone read the whole article for the details. &amp;nbsp; **Declassification.** On Monday, [Trump directed](URL the FBI and DOJ to declassify and release sensitive documents related to the Russia probe, including parts of the FISA warrant to surveil Carter Page, all reports of interviews with Bruce Ohr prepared in connection with the Russia investigations, and all text messages relating to the Russia investigation, without redaction, of James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and Bruce Ohr. * The fact that Trump ordered select parts of the FISA application to be released unredacted, specifically pages 10-12 and 17-34, [hints](URL that those pages contain information that he can use to try to discredit the investigation. Trump told [The Hill TV](URL he was motivated to direct the release by so many people that I respect: the great Lou Dobbs, the great Sean Hannity, the wonderful, great Jeanine Pirro. * Despite Trump ordering the immediate declassification of these materials, the DOJ, FBI, and Office of the Director of National Intelligence [stated](URL they are first going through a methodical declassification review in which certain information will still be redacted to keep information secret - for example, to protect sources. * On Friday, Trump [softened](URL his directive, saying Justice Department officials and others had persuaded him not to declassify the information for the time being. He sent [two tweets](URL stating he had asked the DOJs Inspector General to review the documents and determine what, if anything, can be released. * Trump [revealed](URL in an interview with Sean Hannity that key allies are alarmed that the release of the document could reveal highly sensitive information implicating their own intelligence networks, particularly those concerning Russia. The NYT reported the British were one of nations that objected to the declassification. &amp;nbsp; **Cohen update.** ABC News [reported](URL Michael Cohen has spent hours providing interviews to Muellers team across multiple sessions. They covered topics including Trumps connections with Russia, both financial and business, and any conversations about pardoning Cohen. ABC notes he has also spoken with Manhattan federal prosecutors and is cooperating in New York state investigations of the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization. **Assanges escape.** The Guardian [revealed](URL Russian diplomats hatched a plan to assist Julian Assange in fleeing the U.K. and taking refuge in Russia, where he would be safe from extradition to the U.S. The plan involved giving Assange diplomatic documents so that Ecuador would be able to claim he enjoyed diplomatic immunity. As part of the operation, Assange was to be collected from the embassy in a diplomatic vehicle. * Earlier in the week, the [AP reported](URL on a collection of leaked Wikileaks emails, chat logs, records, and other documents. A November 30, 2010 letter shows Assange tried to obtain a visa from Russia, the day after Wikileaks released the first batch of U.S. State Department files. &amp;nbsp; **Legal fees.** Former Trump lawyer John Dowd [tried to pay](URL the legal fees of Paul Manafort and Rich Gates, in what could appear to be an attempt to tamper with witnesses and obstruct justice. Dowd at first wanted to divert money from the White House legal defense fund but was dissuaded by aides. He later solicited donors for money and pledged $25,000 of his own. &amp;nbsp; **Grand jury.** Jerome Corsi, bureau chief of Infowars and associate of Roger Stone, [testified](URL before Muellers grand jury in DC Friday. Corsi is involved in Muellers probe in part because he appeared to have advance knowledge of Wikileaks hacked information. &amp;nbsp; **Stone.** Roger Stone appeared at a pro-Trump event in West Palm Beach [where he proclaimed](URL  I will never roll on Donald Trump. Michael Cohen I am not. He added, hell never turn on Trump even if Mueller tries to frame me for some extraneous crime. * At least ten associates of Roger Stone have been contacted by Muellers team. Stone said, The FBI tried to question my cleaning lady and FBI agents have been seen sifting through my garbage. Heres what I can tell you: they will find no evidence of Russian collusionThey will find no evidence of Wikileaks collaboration. &amp;nbsp; #More Russian Connections **Trump whisperer.** Journalist Greg Millers new Trump book, [The Apprentice](URL contains a worrying, but not surprising, tidbit: Putin would tell Trump in phone conversations that the deep state was keeping them apart and trying to ruin their relationship. The following is an [excerpt](URL &gt;In phone conversations with Trump, Putin would whisper conspiratorially, telling the U.S. president that it wasnt their fault that they could not consummate the relationship that each had sought. Instead, Putin sought to reinforce Trumps belief that he was being undermined by a secret government cabal, a bureaucratic deep state. &gt;Its not us. We get it, Putin would tell Trump, according to White House aides. Its the subordinates fighting against our friendship. &amp;nbsp; **Jail visitors.** Russian officials have [been visiting](URL Maria Butina and Yevgeniy Nikulin, two Russian nationals held in U.S. jails, raising questions about whether the Kremlin is trying to interfere in the high-profile cases of alleged cyber and political meddling. Butina is accused of being a Russian spy and Nikulin is a Russian hacker extradited from the Czech Republic. * Butina has been visited six times in the past 2 months and Nikulin has been visited multiple times by Russian officials. * They are clearly worried and want to make sure that the people are not talking, and put pressure to release them, said John Sipher, who spent 28 years in the CIA serving in Moscow and running the agencys Russia operations. &amp;nbsp; **N.K. sanctions.** The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, called an emergency meeting of the security council to [accuse Russia](URL of cheating on sanctions against North Korea by helping the country acquire oil and coal. She further accused Russia of threatening to block an independent report on the status of North Korean sanctions unless a list of Russian violations was excised. Russia denies both charges. &amp;nbsp; **Bungled sanctions.** The Daily Beast [reported](URL that the Trump administration did not initially intend to sanction Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska and his aluminum company Rusal. The sanctions reportedly came from a mistaken statement by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin while under oath before Congress. Mnuchin stated his department would be applying sanctions, when there was no plan to do so. Mnuchins slip-up forced Treasury officials to scramble to come up with a plan that would match the secretarys under-oath statement. * Daily Beast: Treasury broke protocol and did not coordinate closely with other departments to properly scrutinize Deripaska and evaluate the impact of the sanctionswhich roiled global markets and caused aluminum prices to skyrocket, mainly affecting U.S. partners in Europe. * This new information may explain why Mnuchin is [now considering](URL lifting the sanctions on Rusal. &amp;nbsp; **FCC interference.** The New York Times [sued the FCC](URL because the agency has refused to release records that may reveal Russian interference in the net neutrality repeal proceeding. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel wrote an op-ed that said the commission received half a million comments from Russian email addresses. &amp;nbsp; **Russia-NRA.** The Russian intelligence operation the Internet Research Agency often followed the NRAs messaging on social media so closely, it copied the content word for word.

12,cyber crime,Keep_Track,"Oleg Deripaska, who Manafort owed $20M, has his U.S. assets frozen",1,9mjhd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/9mjhd2/oleg_deripaska_who_manafort_owed_20m_has_his_us/,2018-10-09 09:22:14,"The U.S. government has frozen Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaskas US-based assets, including massive mansions in Manhattan and Washington, DC. **Who is Oleg Derispaska, and why was he sanctioned?** Deripaska is an aluminum billionaire with close ties to both Putin and Russian mob leaders. He has been sanctioned over allegations of money laundering, threatening the lives of business rivals, murder, etc. The U.S. Treasurys [announcement](URL of the sanctions says: &gt; Oleg Deripaska is being designated pursuant to E.O. 13661 for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, a senior official of the Government of the Russian Federation, as well as pursuant to E.O. 13662 for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy. Deripaska has said that he does not separate himself from the Russian state. He has also acknowledged possessing a Russian diplomatic passport, and claims to have represented the Russian government in other countries. Deripaska has been investigated for money laundering, and has been accused of threatening the lives of business rivals, illegally wiretapping a government official, and taking part in extortion and racketeering. There are also allegations that Deripaska bribed a government official, ordered the murder of a businessman, and had links to a Russian organized crime group. Trump Treasury Secretary talks tough in the press release: &gt; The Russian government operates for the disproportionate benefit of oligarchs and government elites, said Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. The Russian government engages in a range of malign activity around the globe, including continuing to occupy Crimea and instigate violence in eastern Ukraine, supplying the Assad regime with material and weaponry as they bomb their own civilians, attempting to subvert Western democracies, and malicious cyber activities. Russian oligarchs and elites who profit from this corrupt system will no longer be insulated from the consequences of their governments destabilizing activities. But [a report in the Daily Beast](URL says that at a Capitol Hill hearing in January, Mnuchin blurted out something he would come to regretby accident. &gt; There will be sanctions that come out of this report, Mnuchin saida surprise statement, because while Congress had ordered the department to create a report on Russian oligarchs, it didnt require that any sanctions be imposed based on it. Mnuchins slip-up forced Treasury officials to scramble to come up with a plan that would match the secretarys under-oath statement, according to four congressional sources directly involved in the sanctions process. And in April, the department sanctioned Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska and his aluminum company Rusal. Whoops. But at least in July 2018, [Mnuchin tried to backpedal later](URL [FBI agents tried unsuccessfully to flip Deripaska](URL in exchange for information on Russian organized crime  and Russias aid to President Trumps 2016 campaign, the New York Times reported last month. Lastly, keep in mind that sanctions like these, under the Magnitsky Act, were the subject of the [6/9/16 Trump Tower meeting attended by Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort.](URL **The Deripaska/Manafort Connection** Deripaska and Manafort worked together on a lobbying project in the US in 2006, and Deripaska signed a [$10 million annual contract with Manafort](URL for the deal, which Manafort said would ""greatly benefit the Putin Government."" When Manafort joined the Trump campaign ten years later, [he owed Deripaska close to $20 million](URL according to legal complaints Deripaska's lawyers filed in the Cayman Islands and New York. Remember also that Manafort wrote an email to his associate, the former Russian-Ukrainian intelligence operative Konstantin Kilimnik (indicted by Mueller), offering to give Deripaska ""private briefings"" about the Trump campaign. Kilimnik was indicted by Mueller this month. &gt; How do we use [the Trump campaign] to get whole,"" Manafort responded. ""Has OVD operation seen?"" (""OVD"" refers to Deripaska's full name: Oleg Vladimirovich Deripaska. ) Interestingly, although the US government has frozen Deripaskas US assets including his NY mansion, Deripaska has arranged to have Dasha Zhokova and her children live there. ** The Dasha Zhokova/Ivanka Connection** Zhokova is the ex-wife of Deripaskas business partner, the oligarch Roman Abramovich, and Ivanka Trump is a close friend. While they were married, Zhukova and Abramovich traveled with Ivanka and Jared Kushner all over the world  Russia, Croatia, Aspen, etc. "

On to the review... ##Week of June 17 - 23: What We Learned in the Russia Probe ###Mueller investigation Roger Stones frenemy Randy Credico [told reporters](URL that Mueller has reached out to him for a voluntary interview, but he doesnt plan on talking unless he gets subpoenaed. Credico told the Daily Beast, The last thing that I would like to be known as is a rat. Credico is a person of interest because Stone told the House Intelligence Committee that Credico was a backchannel between him [Stone] and Assange. Credico denies facilitating any such communication. Paul Wood, a BBC journalist, says an American lawyer [told Wood](URL that he was approached by a Cambridge Analytica employee after the election. The employee told the lawyer that the company had the Clinton emails more than a month before they were published by WikiLeaks. The employee then asked the lawyer what he should do, to which the lawyer replied he should take the information to Mueller. Adam Waldman, a longtime US lobbyist for Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, [visited Julian Assange](URL nine times in 2017. It is not known what was discussed at the meetings. The dates of some of Waldmans visits are interesting, specifically three visits that occurred directly before and after Trumps inauguration. * Waldman was last in the news for text messages he sent to Sen. Mark Warner, offering to broker a deal between Assange and the DOJ. * Deripaska is tied up in Muellers probe through his connections with Manafort. Manafort worked for Deripaska for many years and offered the oligarch a confidential briefing during the 2016 election. Further, Deripaska was recorded speaking about the US election with Russias deputy PM on a luxury yacht. A woman who was allegedly on the yacht with the two men is sitting in a Thai jail, but has offered the FBI to trade her freedom for damning information on Russias involvement in the US election. McClatchy [revealed more evidence](URL suggesting Donald Trump was involved in, or assisted others in, money laundering. Buyers from Russia or former Soviet republics made 86 all-cash sales  totaling nearly $109 million  at 10 Trump-branded properties in South Florida and New York City. * Aleksandr Burman: A Ukrainian healthcare executive sentenced to 10 years in prison for a $26 million fraud scheme in New York paid $725,000 in cash for a Trump Tower condo in Florida in 2009. * Leonid Zeldovich: A man who did extensive business in Russian-annexed Crimea paid over $4.35 million for four Trump units, three of which are in New York City, between 2007-2010. * Igor Romashov: A Chairman of the board of a Russian oil transport company under U.S. sanctions paid $620,000 upfront for a unit in Florida in 2010. * Many buyers appeared to pay more than the market value for Trump properties, another sign of money laundering. For example, Natalia Sivokozova paid $1.3 million for a Trump unit that was only assessed at $923,803. *Several buyers also had criminal backgrounds. For example, a man found guilty of operating a sports betting ring for a Russian-American organized crime group bought a Trump unit for $830,000 in Florida in 2010. The daughter of a Ukrainian businessman accused of laundering tens of millions of dollars paid $1.25 million for a Florida unit in 2013. Roger Stone has [once again](URL told the media that it's possible he'll be indicted. He added that Mueller's investigation has made it difficult for him to talk to Trump. Rudy Giuliani [revealed](URL that earlier this year FBI agents questioned him about his 2016 remarks predicting a surprise in the closing days of the presidential race that would benefit then-Republican nominee Donald Trump. There has been persistent worry about anti-Clinton forces in the New York FBI field office, which Giuliani has connections to from his time as former US attorney for SDNY. Unfortunately the recent IG report failed to investigate this aspect of the FBIs role in the 2016 election. **Michael Cohen** Today, Monday, Stormy Daniels was [scheduled to meet](URL with prosecutors in SDNYs investigation of Michael Cohen, but the attorneys office [canceled](URL due to fear of media coverage. Michael Cohen [resigned](URL from the deputy finance chair of the RNCs Finance Committee, citing Muellers probe as one reason but also criticizing Trumps family separation policy. Cohen [hired a new lawyer](URL Guy Petrillo, on Tuesday. Petrillo spent two years in the Southern District of New York US Attorney's office, the same agency that is investigating Cohen. According to his website, Petrillo specializes in cases involving money laundering and fraud. Tom Arnold [tweeted](URL a photo of himself and Michael Cohen hanging out, and later went on various TV shows to claim that the two are teaming up to take down Trump. Arnold again implied he has damaging tapes of Donald Trump. After this, however, [Cohen took to Twitter](URL to deny discussing anything related to Trump. * &lt;Personally, I feel that this was simply a convenient photo op for both of their purposes. Arnold has a special coming out on Vice about the search for the Trump tapes. Hes gotten more media coverage from the Cohen photo than hes gotten in many years; what a great way to hype a new project. Cohen, on the other hand, gets to put out another message to Trump: pay me, because I have the means to ruin you. Its a threat, essentially.&gt; The South Korean aerospace company (KAI) that paid Cohen $150,000 for accounting advice [failed to disclose](URL that it was the subject of a corruption investigation, yet was awarded a $48 million contract from the U.S. military. Last year, the former CEO and eight other executives were indicted in Seoul on charges of bribery, embezzlement, and defrauding the South Korean government. * Cohen time as a consultant for the company began before the CEO was arrested and ended after KAI won the contract. KAI is now considered a front-runner to win an $18 billion contract with the U.S. military; its unclear how KAIs failure to disclose the corruption charges may affect their bid. ###Other Russian Connections A group of American senators will [travel to Russia](URL at the end of the month and celebrate Independence Day in Moscow. Reportedly the group includes Richard Shelby of Alabama, John Neely Kennedy of Louisiana and North Dakotas John Hoeven. John Bolton is traveling to Moscow and [will meet](URL with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. His visit is expected to be prep for a meeting between Trump and Putin that will occur sometime in July. Two times of the month have [been mentioned](URL either before July 11th or after July 13th. Wilbur Ross [failed to truly divest](URL his holdings/interests in foreign companies, including Navigator, a shipping firm tied to Vladimir Putins inner circle, multiple companies co-owned by the Chinese government, and a Cypriot bank Mueller is investigating. When Ross found out the Paradise Papers (which included this news) was about to be published, he opened a short position against the Russian company, meaning hed profit if the shares dropped. Predictably, the stock went down and Ross cashed out with a profit. * The companies Ross is involved with are connected in a tangled web to other players in the Russia probe. For example, the largest shareholder in the Cypriot bank is a company connected to Viktor Vekselberg, whom Ross once hosted in his office around 2014. Vekselbergs firm paid Michael Cohens shell company $500,000 for consulting. Earlier this year Mueller stopped Vekselberg at an airport, questioning him and searching his electronics. Note, [Vekselberg also attended](URL Trumps inauguration and was at the 2015 RT gala in Moscow with Michael Flynn and Jill Stein. * Forbes [mentions](URL that, like his boss, Ross lies about his wealth. Despite claiming a personal worth in the billions, his financial disclosure report revealed less than $700 million in assets. When pressed about the discrepancy, Ross calmly cited more than $2 billion in undisclosed assets. Rick Perry is [going to host](URL Russias energy minister, Alexander Novak, for a meeting in Washington DC this week. One has to wonder if Perry will bring up Russias attacks on our energy grid... ###Congress/States Obamas cybersecurity czar Michael Daniel testified before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on Wednesday. The committee [reached a bipartisan conclusion](URL that the Obama administration did not do enough to stop the Russians from interfering in the 2016 election. Daniel had ordered his team to begin developing aggressive countermeasures to deter the Kremlins efforts in the early summer of 2016, but none were actually put into action. In August 2016 Daniels team was told to stand down because some officials did not want to be seen to be favoring Clinton in the election. * Sen. Mark Warner said that while Obama officials could have done more, the Trump campaign and its allies cravenly painted any attempt to call out Russia for its attacks as a political effort to help Clinton and to steal an election. Also before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Daniel [testified](URL that Russian hackers likely scanned all 50 states for vulnerabilities in 2016, not just the 21 states previously confirmed as targets. Dems on the House Intelligence Committee [released the names](URL of about 1,100 Russian Twitter accounts, many of which were active as recently as last month. Their tweets commented on Roseanne Barrs firing and Don Jr.s divorce, but not all were the MAGA accounts we are used to seeing from the Kremlins Internet Research Agency. * In a testament to their goal of creating dissent and conflict in America, some of the accounts had starkly pro-Resistance messages. For example, KaniJJackson used Resistance hashtags like impeach45, GunReformNow, and Resist, while also shaming Roseanne for her racist tweet. Another, wokelisa, with more than 55k followers used to TakeAKnee hashtag to argue that kneeling during the anthem is in fact patriotic. &lt;Commentary: Findings like this highlight that we have to be very skeptical of accounts on Twitter, and elsewhere on the internet. The appearance of similar viewpoints to your own does not make them an ally.&gt; Sen. James Lankford, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, [stated Wednesday](URL that Russian bots are using the current family separation and immigration debate to sow discord among Americans. [State election officials](URL say they havent received as much federal funding as they need to secure their election systems. Minnesota and Vermont asked lawmakers for more to upgrade equipment and cybersecurity. This year, 41 states are using voting systems that are at least a decade old. ###Other A 100 member delegation from Cyprus and Cypriot organizations [paid to hold a conference](URL at Trump's D.C. hotel to explicitly look into ways of exerting influence on Trump, one of which was surely bringing business to the hotel. Adding to the conflicts of interest, U.S. government officials addressed paying guests from behind a Trump Hotels-branded lectern, further blurring the line between Trumps private companies and the presidency. * As if that wasnt enough intrigue, Cyprus is involved in Muellers probe. Mueller is reportedly investigating flows of money into the Cyprus bank account of a company that specialized in social-media manipulation and whose founder reportedly met with Donald Trump Jr. One has to wonder if this connection played a part in the low price conference members paid for their rooms. In 2017, the average cost of a room at Trump hotel was $652.98 a night. However, the Cypriot attendees paid only $325 per night. * What other foreign countries have had delegations stay at Trumps D.C. hotel? The U.S. embassies of Azerbaijan, Bahrain, and Kuwait; Malaysias prime minister; Romanias president; Saudi Arabian lobbyists; and the TurkeyU.S. Business Council. A couple of weeks ago, the Philippines embassy stayed there to celebrate its countrys independence, and later this month a Vietnamese private company is holding a seminar at the hotel to drum up Americans investment in its country. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **To note** An organizer of last years Unite the Right white supremacist rally in Charlottesville has [received initial approval](URL to hold a rally across from the White House on August 12th, the anniversary of last year's event. Taxpayers [have paid $20 million](URL for extra Coast Guard patrols to protect Trump during his trips to Mar-A-Lago, which have numbered 16 so far. Note: This data does not include the cost of Trumps weeklong stay at his estate with Japanese PM Abe, which conceivably could have cost more than average.

But I don't have today off work so screw it. I'm not bitter...I promise... **Housekeeping:** * Shameless plug: If you havent yet, [check out the spreadsheet](URL I made of *all* departures from the Trump administration. Im in the process of adding a nominations section and a group resignation section. * Theres a mailing list for notifications when this review is posted plus a link. To be added, send me PM with your email address. If you signed up already, check the spam folder just in case * If youd like to donate a dollar a month, Id appreciate it: [patreon](URL Reviews will continue regardless. On to the review... ---------------------------------------------------- ##Week of May 20 - 26: What we Learned in the Russia Probe [Taxi King](URL -------------------------------------------------------- ###Mueller investigation Mueller is investigating Psy-group, an Israeli firm that specializes in collecting information and shaping opinion through social media. * Muellers team has [obtained](URL a nine-slide presentation prepared by Psy-group that outlines ways in which Trumps 2016 election was helped by fake news and fake social-media accounts. * The presentation outlines the ways in which social media bots and fake online content were used to help energize voters supportive of Mr. Trump... [one] slide says the firm identified 140 pro-Trump websites linked to a man in Macedonia Another slide outlines a Facebook strategy where fake online profiles or avatars engage real people online and encourage them to share content, resulting in a multiplier effect with mass people spreading lies. It is unclear who received the presentation. * Psy-group is owned by Joel Zamel, who has [been questioned](URL by Muellers team. After the 2016 election, Psy-group  formed a strategic partnership with Cambridge Analytica in a joint bid to win business from the U.S. government and other clients. * Zamel first appeared in the news when the [NYT identified him](URL as a participant in a second Trump Tower meeting. Don Jr., Zamel, George Nader, and Erik Prince met three months before the 2016 election to strategize ways to help Trump Sr. win. Nader, acting as an emissary of Saudi Arabia and UAE, expressed the Crown Princes desire to assist Trump in his win. Zamel extolled his companys ability to give an edge to a political campaign; by that time, the firm had already drawn up a multimillion-dollar proposal for a social media manipulation effort to help elect Mr. Trump. Don Jr. reportedly responded approvingly. Giuliani [made up](URL a supposed September 1st deadline for the Mueller probe, according to a source familiar with Muellers investigation. * A source familiar with the probe called the Sept. 1 deadline entirely made-up and another apparent effort to pressure the special counsel to hasten the end of his work...Hell wrap it up when he thinks hes turned over every rock In an [interview with HuffPost](URL Giuliani argued that if Trump colluded with Russia or any foreign entity, it wouldnt be a crime. His exact words: OK, and if it is [collusion], it isnt illegal... It was sort of like a gift, he said. And youre not involved in the illegality of getting it. The [AP reviewed](URL leaked emails between Elliott Broidy, former RNC Finance Chairman and top fundraiser for Trump, and George Nader, who is now cooperating with Mueller. The two men pitched themselves to the crown princes of Saudi Arabia and the UAE as a backchannel to the White House in a scheme to enrich themselves. * Saudi Arabia and the UAE were seeking to alter U.S. foreign policy and punish their archrival Qatar. After a year of lobbying Washington and making large donations to various politicians, Nader and Broidy expected to receive massive consulting contracts from the two Gulf nations. * Summaries written by Broidy of two meetings he had with Trump  one of which has not been disclosed before  report that he was passing messages to the president from the two princes and that he told Trump he was seeking business with them. * It appears from the APs reporting that the two men would have gotten their big payout had Mueller not intervened and detained Nader at the airport in mid-January 2018. Elliott Broidy is [now suing](URL various people/entities, including a Qatari official, that he claims hacked his emails and leaked them to the media. * Interestingly, this Qatari official, Ahmed al-Rumaihi, is [the same man](URL caught on video meeting with Michael Cohen in Trump Tower AND the same man who claims Michael Cohen asked him for $1 million in exchange for helping a Qatari investment fund with American projects. * Broidy further asserts that the actual hacks were coordinated by a U.S. company linked to a former CIA spy. His lawsuit lays out that a U.S.-based security firm, Global Risk Advisors, introduced Qatar to cyber mercenaries who executed that hack. Those alleged hackers include Omniscope Ltd., a U.K.-based security and intelligence firm. Spanish police [have given](URL the FBI wiretaps of conversations involving Putin ally Alexander Torshin, who met with Don Jr. during an NRA convention in May 2016. The lead Spanish investigator has said: Mr. Trumps son should be concerned. Torshin had multiple contacts with conservative activists in the United States during the election, seeking to set up a summit between the Russian president and then candidate Trump. The Putin ally and Russian hedge fund manager who met with Erik Prince in the Seychelles, Kirill Dmitriev, has [contradicted](URL Princes account of the meeting as a chance encounter over a beer - suggesting he had wanted to meet with Prince in order to improve relations between the U.S and Russia. Dmitriev would not state that the meeting wasnt planned in advance. Roger Stones emails [reveal](URL he privately sought information he considered damaging to Clinton from Wikileaks Julian Assange during the 2016 campaign, raising questions about Stones testimony to Congress. * In Sepember 2016, Stone sent an email to Randy Credico, an acquantance of both Stone and Assange, stating: Please ask Assange for any State or HRC e-mail from August 10 to August 30--particularly on August 20, 2011. * Rep. Adam Schiff says the emails were not provided to congressional investigators. If there is such a document, then it would mean that his testimony was either deliberately incomplete or deliberately false, said Schiff. * Also in the emails are threats from Stone as Credico became more vocal about discrepancies in Stones account of their interactions. In early April, in one of those emails, Stone accused Credico of serving as an informant. Everyone says u are wearing a wire for Mueller, the April 7 email said. Two days later, Stone wrote: Run your mouth = get sued. Credico denies being an informant, and has sent [Mother Jones](URL screenshots of threats from Stone, including a message saying prepare to die. * Stone appeared on Meet the Press, saying that he is prepared for the possibility that he will be indicted for some extraneous crime pertaining to my business that Muellers team may seek to conjure up. * Credico has reportedly told Democratic Committee staffers that Assange is willing to meet with Rep. Schiff. Schiffs response? Our committee would be willing to interview Julian Assange when he is in U.S. custody, not before. The FBI has [seized control](URL of a key server in the Kremlins global botnet of 500,000 hacked routers, linked to Fancy Bear - the Russian hacking group that hit the DNC in 2016. * The malware has turned up in 54 countries, including the US. The best way to ensure you are not affected is to reboot your router. Trump [tweeted](URL that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper stated Trump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign. This was an intentional misquote of what Clapper actually said on The View. The full exchange is [transcribed by the NYT](URL but can be paraphrased as: Clapper stated the FBI was not spying on the Trump campaign, they were spying on what the Russians were doing. He explicitly states he dislikes the term spying. A better description would seem to be intelligence gathering. * Trumps lawyer Rudy Giuliani went on TV Sunday and [admitted](URL that Trumps Spygate claims are actually an attempt to sway public opinion against Muellers investigation. Further, Giuliani stated that the decision to impeach Trump is going to come up, and he hopes that Trumps attacks on Mueller will limit the risk of impeachment. **Michael Cohen** Cohens long-time business partner, Evgeny Freidman, has [reached a deal](URL to cooperate with federal and state prosecutors. * Freidman is called the [Taxi King](URL because, at his peak in 2015, he owned 1,100 taxi medallions, which put his net worth in the neighborhood of $1.5 billion. However, as Business Insider explains, the rise of ride-sharing companies like Uber tanked the value of taxi medallions. Freidman defaulted on a $34 million loan and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for 22 of his companies. In June 2017 he was arrested and charged with four counts of tax fraud and one count of grand larceny. * Cohens connection to Freidman: Freidman managed cabs for Cohen (for the past 16 years, according to Freidman), even after New York City regulators barred Freidman last year from continuing to manage medallions. As of August of 2017, Cohen [reportedly](URL owed more than $40,000 in back taxes related to the medallions. * As confirmation of Freidmans cooperation became public, Cohen [insisted](URL they were not business partners. He [tweeted](URL I am one of thousands of medallion owners who entrust management companies to operate my medallions according to the rules of the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission. Gene Freidman and I are not partners and have never been partners in this business or any other. #MediaWrongAgain * However, [public records reveal](URL that Cohen used his Trump email on multiple occasions to conduct business for his NY Funky Taxi Corp. medallion, which Freidman managed since at least 2012. This makes it much harder for Cohen to argue that he was practicing law, as he was using a business email. Last year, Cohen [received a secret payment](URL of at least $400 million from Ukraine to arrange a meeting between Trump and Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko. * Poroshenko reportedly desired a meeting with Trump because he had backed Clinton during the election, likely authorizing a leak from Ukraines anti-corruption agency showing Manafort received millions of dollars from pro-Russian interests in Ukraine. However, Ukraine's registered lobbyists and embassy in Washington DC was unable to secure more than a brief photo-op with Trump. Cohen was contacted as a back channel to Trump. * The meeting, which Poroshenko called a ""substantial visit,"" occurred in June 2017. Shortly after Poroshenko returned Ukraine, the countrys anti-corruption agency stopped its investigation into Manafort. * According to the BBC: One source in Kiev said Mr Poroshenko had given Trump a gift - making sure that Ukraine would find no more evidence to give the US inquiry into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. Video footage in Trump Tower [reveals](URL that Cohen met with Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg 11 days before the presidential inauguration to allegedly discuss improving U.S. - Russia relations under Trump. Also present was Andrew Intrater, owner of the private equity firm Columbus Nova that awarded Mr. Cohen a $1 million consulting contract. Vekelsberg was stopped by Muellers team and questioned earlier this year. Intrater has been interviewed by Muellers team twice, focusing partly on his dealings with Cohen. * [Michael Avenatti](URL Theres a reason why Columbus Novas story keeps changing by the day and theres a reason why they are covering-up. The truth is not pretty...but it is necessary. Mr. Trump will not serve out his term. On April 5th, Cohen [attended a meeting](URL with Franklin Haney, the owner of an Alabama nuclear power plant, and Sheikh Ahmed bin Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani, Qatars minister of economy and commerce and deputy chairman of the Qatar Investment Authority. * A source familiar with the discussion states Cohen and Thani met with Haney to discuss possible Qatari investment in his nuclear power plant. Sources also told Mother Jones that Cohen could have expected to receive a finders fee if a deal were struck. * This isnt the only time Cohen met with Al Thani - that same week in April, Cohen [met with him](URL in Florida on the sidelines of the Qatar-US Economic Forum. In December 2016, Cohen [met with a different](URL Qatari official to pitch him access to the Trump White House in exchange for $1 million. * Haney has [aggressively courted](URL the Trump administration, giving $1 million to Trumps inaugural committee and at least $125,000 to the Republican National Committee this year. Haney is also a member of Mar-a-Lago and has bragged to associates that he has dined with Trump at least a dozen times since the election. ###Congress The DOJ held [two highly classified briefings](URL for congressional leaders on Thursday, May 24th, about the investigation into Trumps campaign and the FBIs use of an informant. * The first meeting was originally intended to be only for Republican leaders, namely Nunes and Gowdy. However, after outrage and pushing by the public and the Democrats, one of their leaders was allowed to attend. Thus the first meeting included Rep. Trey Gowdy, Speaker Paul Ryan, Rep. Adam Schiff, Rep. Devin Nunes, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, Rod Rosenstein, and Chris Wray. The second meeting was attended by the Gang of Eight, the leaders of both parties from both chambers, and the heads of the intelligence committees. * Causing great controversy, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and White House lawyer Emmet Flood [showed up](URL unexpectedly at both briefings. At least two participants in the briefings told Kelly and Flood their appearance was inappropriate. The two men left both meetings after making introductory remarks, to relay the Presidents desire for as much openness as possible under the law. * Trumps personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was much more frank about the purpose of Kelly and Floods appearances, stating: We want to see how the briefing went to today and how much we learned from it, referring to how hes deciding whether or not Trump will sit for an interview with Mueller. If we learned a good deal from it, it will shorten that whole process considerably. * Upon leaving the briefing, Schiff read [a statement](URL of behalf of himself, Pelosi, and Schumer: ""Nothing we heard today has changed our view that there is no evidence to support any allegation that the FBI or any intel agency placed a spy in the Trump campaign. * Mitch McConnell echoed this sentiment, [telling Fox News](URL he had learned nothing particularly surprising. ###Other [Jared Kushner](URL &amp; [Ivanka Trump](URL have both received full security clearances. The same NYT article also revealed Jared Kushner has sat for two interviews with Muellers team, lasting many hours. The [most recent](URL occurred in April, according to Kushners lawyer. It seems Trumps trade war has turned out to be beneficial afterall - for the Trumps! In addition to Trump Sr. receiving a $500 million investment from China in an Indonesian development deal, Ivanka Trump [now has five *more* trademarks](URL approved in China. Some are [suggesting](URL that its very likely Elliot Broidy is covering for Trumps affair with a Playboy Playmate (and her subsequent abortion). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **To note** Resistance news: Im including this because one of the most frustrating experiences is watching people - rational people - fall for con men/women on twitter. First, it was [Louise Mensch and Claude Taylor](URL Then [Scott Dworkin](URL Now [Ed and Brian Krassenstein](URL - who the Feds say illegally hawked investment scams. Law enforcement officials last year seized nearly half a million dollars from the brothers, money that prosecutors say was derived from wire fraud. **Please apply the same rational, logical, and healthy skepticism of people who claim to be on the left as to those who are on the right.** --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [My twitter](URL Thanks for reading!

15,cyber crime,Keep_Track,Key excerpts from the New Yorker piece on Steele memo alleging that Russia blocked Mitt Romney from Sec of State,222,82bmr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/82bmr8/key_excerpts_from_the_new_yorker_piece_on_steele/,2018-03-06 13:27:50,"Instead of 14,753 words, here are key excerpts of 3,938 words for easier and wider consumption. About 15 minutes of reading. ##STEELE BACKGROUND EXCERPTS * Steele spent more than 20 years in M.I.6, mostly focussing on Russia. Spied in Moscow for 3 years in the 90s. Considered an expert on the country. * ""Steeles already dim view of the Kremlin darkened in November, 2006, when Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian K.G.B. officer and a Putin critic who had been recruited by M.I.6, suffered an agonizing death in a London hospital, after drinking a cup of tea poisoned with radioactive polonium-210. Moscow had evidently sanctioned a brazen murder in his own country. Steele was put in charge of M.I.6s investigation. Authorities initially planned to indict one suspect in the murder, but Steeles investigative work persuaded them to indict a second suspect as well. Nine years later, the U.K.s official inquiry report was finally released, and it confirmed Steeles view: the murder was an operation by the F.S.B., and it was probably approved by Vladimir Putin."" * In 2008, Michael Hayden, the C.I.A. director, visited the U.K., and Steele briefed him on Russian developments. The following year, President Obama visited the U.K., and was briefed on a report that Steele had written about Russia. Steve Hall, a former chief of the C.I.A.s Central Eurasia Division, which includes Russia, the former Soviet states, and the Balkans, told me, M.I.6 is second only perhaps to the U.S. in its ability to collect intelligence from Russia."" --- ##INITIAL DOSSIER REACTIONS * Spring 2016 - Orbis Business Intelligence, Steele's co-founded investigative research firm, subcontracted work for Fusion GPS. Fusion GPS, ""in turn, had been contracted by a law firm, Perkins Coie"" which represented Clinton's campaign and the DNC. * Steele learned, months after signing the deal, that his work was being subsidized by the Clinton campaign and the DNC. * January - Steele learns that Sen. Graham and Sen. Grassley, ""referred his name to the Dept. of Justice, for a possible criminal investigation."" They accuse him of lying to the FBI. Though the referral was classified, they had something to do with the ""contacts he'd had with the press."" * Steele was stunned by the allegations and worried as to the legal costs, federal criminal repercussions, or assassination by a ""Putin emissary."" * Legal experts assured him that the referral was merely a political stunt. Nevertheless, Trump's defenders accused him of fabricating false charges in order to ""nullify the 2016 election."" Trump's defenders were ""trying to take down the whole intelligence community,"" Steele exclaimed one day to friends. ""And they're using me as the battering ram."" * Sen. Feinstein declared that Republicans' goals were ""undermining the FBI and Special Counsel Mueller's investigation"" and ""deflecting attention"" from it. She said that no evidence was provided that Steele lied and that ""not a single revelation in the dossier has been refuted."" * **Sen. Whitehouse stated, ""To impeach Steele's dossier is to impeach Mueller's investigation"" and that the Republicans' aim was to ""create a false narrative saying this is all a political witch hunt.""** * Indeed, Nunes produced his memo on Jan 18th, alleging that Clinton had colluded with Russians to get dirt on Trump, feed it to the FBI to open up an investigation."" There was no evidence that Clinton was involved in Steele's reports or worked with Russians. * Nonetheless, Tucker Carlson, Hannity, the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal, Rush Limbaugh, and others, repeated the claim that the dossier was fabricated and that Clinton or the ""Deep State"" was somehow involved. * On Feb 8th, Trump echoed this talking point. * Sen. Whitehouse stated that Steele's accusers knew that due to him being a former intelligence officer, much of his life must remain secret, and thus ""they are using selective declassification as a tactic - they use declassified information to tell their side, and then the rebuttal is classified."" --- ##ORBIS BACKGROUND EXCERPTS * Specializes in Russian expertise. * Fewer than ten full-time employees, but according to co-founder Burrows, ""were a bit like the bridge on the Starship Enterprisewere a small group but we manage an enormous ship."" * Employs dozens of confidential ""collectors"" around the world; such as private investigators, investigative reporters, and subject-matter experts. The investigators harvest info from a much larger network of unpaid sources. They are not paid for a number of reasons, including that it might encourage them to embellish. * In 2012, an Orbis informant quoted an F.S.B. agent describing [Steele] as an enemy of Mother Russia. * One of Orbis' clients was a law firm representing the interests of Oleg Deripaska. This prompted Sen. Grassley to demand more info from the firm. * ""Two of [Steele's] earliest cases at Orbis involved investigating international crime rings whose leaders, coincidentally, were based in New Yorks Trump Tower."" * He later investigated FIFA corruption and that Putin had ""dragged in all sorts of capabilities"" in order to win the bidding process for the 2018 World Cup. ""Deputy Prime Minister, Igor Sechinnow the C.E.O. of the Russian state-controlled oil giant Rosneftis suspected of having traveled to Qatar to swap World Cup votes. * ""In 2015, the Justice Department indicted fourteen people in connection with a hundred and fifty million dollars in bribes and kickbacks. One of them was Chuck Blazer, a top FIFA official who had embezzled a fortune from the organization and became an informant for the F.B.I. Blazer had an eighteen-thousand-dollar-per-month apartment in Trump Tower, a few floors down from Trumps residence."" * ""Several years ago, the F.B.I. hired Steele to help crack an international gambling and money-laundering ring purportedly run by a suspected Russian organized-crime figure named Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov. The syndicate was based in an apartment in Trump Tower."" He eluded arrest, was issued a ""red notice"" by Interpol, and in the fall of 2013 showed up at the Miss Universe in Moscow, and sat near Trump. * **""It was as if all criminal roads led to Trump Tower, Steele told friends.** * Burrows said that on several occasions Orbis had warned authorities about major security threats. * When Steele took his suspicions about Trump to the F.B.I. in the summer of 2016, it was in keeping with Orbis protocol, rather than a politically driven aberration. --- ##PRE-ELECTION RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE * Even before the 2016 election, Steele was convinced Russia was interfering in Western elections. Project Charlemagne outlined 4 EU nations; France, Italy, UK, and Germany, as well as Turkey, a candidate for membership. * The report chronicles persistent and aggressive political interference; ""social-media warfare aimed at inflaming fear and prejudice, and opaque financial support given to favored politicians in the form of bank loans, gifts, and other kinds of support."" * Kremlin entangled with Italy's PM Berlusconi, and French right-wing leader Marine Le Pen. Russian aid was given to right-wing nationalist leaders in the UK. * **The Kremlins long-term aim, the report concludes, was to boost extremist groups and politicians at the expense of Europes liberal democracies. The more immediate goal was to destroy the E.U., in order to end the punishing economic sanctions that the E.U. and the U.S. had imposed on Russia after its 2014 political and military interference in Ukraine.** * The report was a red light and outlined that Russian interference in foreign elections, it cautioned, was only likely to grow in size and reach over time. --- ##FUSION GPS * Glen Simpson, co-founder of Fusion GPS, wanted Steele to ""help Fusion follow some difficult leads on Trumps ties to Russia"". * ""Funding for the project originally came from an organization financed by the New York investor Paul Singer, a Republican who disliked Trump."" * Singer dropped out once it was clear Trump would win the nomination. Fusion then ""persuaded Marc Elias, the general counsel for the Clinton campaign, to subsidize the unfinished research."" * **""This bipartisan funding history belies the argument that the research was corrupted by its sponsorship.""** * ""One question particularly gnawed at Simpson. Why had Trump repeatedly gone to Russia in search of business, yet returned empty-handed? "" * Within a few weeks ""Steeles long-standing collectors came back with reports drawn from Orbiss larger network of sources."" As Simpson put it, ""We threw out a line in the water, and Moby-Dick came back."" * Sources claimed that the FSB could easily blackmail Trump because it had videos of him engaging in ""perverted sexual acts"" in Russia. Specifically the 'golden shower' by prostitutes on a bed previously used by Barack and Michelle. * The sources were ""a former top-level Russian intelligence officer still active inside the Kremlin, a member of the staff at the hotel, a female staffer at the hotel when trump had stayed there, and a close associate of trump who had organized and managed his recent trips to Moscow. * Overshadowing the sexual details, were the claims ""that the Kremlin and Trump were politically coluding in the 2016 campaign."" Russia had cultivated Trump and traded favors ""for at least 5 years."" * **Putin was described as backing Trump in order to sow discord and disunity both within the U.S. and within the transatlantic alliance. The report claimed that, although Trump had not signed any real-estate-development deals, he and his top associates had repeatedly accepted intelligence from the Kremlin on Hillary Clinton and other political rivals. The allegations were astoundingand improbable. They could constitute treason even if they were only partly true.** * Burrows expressed reservation in including the golden-shower allegation... But Steele argued it would be dishonest and distorting to cherry-pick details, and that the possibility of a potential American President being subject to blackmail was too important to hide."" * ""Orbis left it up to Fusion to make the judgment calls about what to leave in, and to decide whether to add caveats and source notes of the kind that accompany most government intelligence reports."" --- ##DOSSIER ARRIVAL * Steele ""sent a courier by plane to Washington to hand-delivery a copy of the dossier."" * Although Trump tweeted that the dossier was ""all cooked up by Clinton"" Steele approached the FBI on his own because he felt a duty to give them the information. * Simpson told the Senate Judiciary Committee that ""this was not considered by me to be part of the work we were doing"". The reason for submitting it to the FBI was that the UK is the USA's closest ally and he felt ""professionally obligated to do it."" * Mark Medish, former director of Russian affairs at the National Security Council, told me that ""if Steele had not shared his findings, he might have been accused of dereliction or a coverup. He added, It takes courage to deliver bad news, particularly when the stakes are so high. And Senator Whitehouse described Steeles actions as akin to warning the F.B.I. about a physical detonation of some sort, noting, If it had gone off, and he or the F.B.I. had ignored it, heads would roll."" * **Despite all the Republicans' claims of a Democratic plot, Steele and Simpson never told their ultimate client, Clinton campaign's law firm, that Steele had gone to the FBI.** * ""As a top Clinton-campaign official told me, If Id known the F.B.I. was investigating Trump, I would have been shouting it from the rooftops!"" --- ##PIECES OF THE TRUMP-RUSSIA COLLUSION * At the same time as Steele informed the FBI about Russia's interference, the Kremlin engaged in at least two other schemes. The first, Papadopoulos, claimed to an Australian diplomat, that Russia had access to thousands of Clinton e-mails. * The second scheme was the June 9, 2016 private, undisclosed, and lied about meeting, at Trump Tower between top members of Trump's campaign, including Trump Jr, Manafort, and Kushner, and Russian lawyer, Natalia Vaselnitskaya. Meeting was set up by Trump Jr. after being approached by an emissary to ""Azerbaijani oligarchs with whom Trump had partnered on the 2013 Miss Universe pageant, in Moscow."" The email promised Donald Jr. that documents ""would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,"" and described this gift as part of Russia and its governments support for Mr. Trump. Instead of going to the F.B.I., as Steele had, Trumps older son responded giddily to the e-mail: If its what you say I love it especially later in the summer. * The meeting closely followed the Papadopoulos encounter and enhanced the dossier's credibility. * The secret meeting was not found out by the press for 10 months. However 5 days after the Trump Tower meeting, news broke that Russians had hacked into the DNC's email system. * In November 2014, Dutch intelligence had provided US authorities with evidence that Russia had hacked into the DNC. * The emails were weaponized as an active measure when they were released by WikiLeaks 5 days prior to the Democratic convention. * ""Trump's response was exultant. He said ""If it is Russiawhich its probably not, nobody knows who it isbut if it is . . . Russia, if youre listening, I hope youre able to find the thirty thousand e-mails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. * **Trump had already started developing pro-Russian positions that were inexplicably outside the Republican mainstream.** * Robby Mook, Clinton campaign manager, told Jake Tapper ""Whats disturbing to us is that experts are telling us that Russian state actors broke into the D.N.C., stole these e-mails, and other experts are now saying that the Russians are releasing these e-mails for the purpose of actually helping Donald Trump. * ""Tapper then interviewed Donald Trump, Jr., who ridiculed Mooks accusation as disgusting and phonyeven though its now known that, just a few weeks earlier, he had met at Trump Tower with a Russian offering dirt on Clinton."" --- ##CARTER PAGE &amp; SANCTIONS * July 7, 2016, Carter Page travels to Moscow and ""criticized Washington and other Western capitals for their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption, and regime change. * Unbeknownst to Steele, Page was already being monitored by US authorities. Following his Moscow visit, Steele filed another memo to Fusion, alleging that Page met with Russians close to Putin, ""as part of an ongoing effort by the Russians to cultivate sympathetic Trump aides"". One of them was Igor Sechin, CEO of Rosneft, ""who proposed to Page increasing US-Russian energy cooperation in exchange for lifting the Ukraine-related sanctions on Russia."" * Another Steele memo alleges that ""Sechin was so eager to get US sanctions lifted that he offered Page the opportunity to help sell a stake of Rosneft to investors."" * Page also allegedly met with Igor Diveykin, a top Kremlin official, to leak Russian kompromat on Clinton to boost Trump's candidacy. * **In a congressional interview in Nov 2017, Page claimed to not have met with Russian officials. Page was then confronted with evidence and forced to admit that he did meet with them, including a top Rosneft executive.** * ""A covert relationship had been established between Page and powerful Russians who wanted U.S. sanctions lifted."" ""Trump and his advisers have repeatedly denied having colluded with Russians."" * A Steele memo names Manafort and Flynn as two other advisers that were sympathetic to Russia. Flynn resigned immediately following revelations that he spoke with Kislyak about US sanctions that Obama imposed. --- ##FURTHER STEELE CLAIMS * July 26, 2016, after WikiLeaks disseminated DNC emails, Steele filed another memo, claiming that the Kremlin was behind the hacking, that Democratic party agents were involved, as well as ""Russian migrs in the U.S. and associated offensive cyber operators."" * Another claim, ""that the hack involved state-sponsored cyber operatives working in Russia was substantiated by Mueller's recent indictment of 13 Russian nationals and 3 Russian organizations. The indictments echo the tactics outlined in the Charlemagne investigation. The Kremlin was spending $1 million a month to fund Internet trolls, working round-the-clock, to spread lies, fan ethnic and religious hatred, and otherwise turning voters towards extremism, in order to help Trump's campaign. * **""A former top State Department official who read [the memos] said, We found the reports about eighty per cent consistent with other sources we had. ""** * Jonathan Winer, a Democratic lawyer and foreign-policy specialist working at the State Dept. said that ""No one wanted to touch [the memos]"" because Obama Administration officials were mindful of the Hatch Act, which forbids government employees to use their positions to influence political elections. --- ##OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ACTION * Steele believed that the attack by Russia was like Pearl Harbor and that Obama should retaliate with a cyberattack that would shut Russia down. * Steele was unaware that by August 2016, a similar debate was taking place inside the White House. A CIA report, ""described as an intelligence bombshell,"" to Obama, warned that Putin was directly involved in trying to help Trump win. Robert Hannigan, head of UK's intel service the GCHQ, briefed CIA director Brennan, on a stream of illicit communications between Trump's team and Moscow. * The White House was unsure how to respond. Obama pulled Putin aside on Sept 5th, at a G20 summit, and reportedly warned him, ""Better stop, or else."" * Obama did not want to provoke a cyberwar, and did not want to appear like they were helping Clinton. All the while Trump called Russian interference a hoax, that the system is rigged, and the Obama and his top aides were trying to undermine the public's faith in the election. * In Sept 2016, Obama tried to persuade the top 8 leaders of congress to issue a bipartisan statement condemning Russian meddling. However McConnel expressed skepticism and refused to sign the statement condemning Russia. * In August 2016, two FBI employees texted about investigating the collusion as a sense of urgency and an insurance policy just in case Clinton did not win. Trey Gowdy seized on this as proof that the FBI had schemed to keep Trump from getting elected. But the full text chain makes it clear they were discussing whether investigating the collussion was an urgency. * **Brennan said that the dossier ""did not play any role whatsoever"" in the intel community's appraisal of Russian election meddling.** * On Oct 7, 2016, Clapper and Jeh Johnson, issued a joint statement that the US IC was confident that Russia had directed the hacking of the DNC emails. * 30 minutes after the statements, the ""Access Hollywood"" tape was released. A few hours later, WikiLeaks started posting private emails of John Podesta. The IC's assessment was buried. --- ##SUBSEQUENT STEELE MEETINGS AND ACTIONS * Steele again met with the FBI in early October 2016 in Rome. The agents asked for everything he had. * Simpson told the senate Judiciary Committee that the FBI agents now ""believed Steele's information might be credible."" * Following the Rome meeting, the FBI got a FISA warrant on Carter Page. * A former journalist, self-styled investigator, and Clinton ally, named Cody Shearer, wrote an unfinished memo that claimed the ""FSB had incriminating videotapes of Trump having sex in Moscow; it also made wild allegations that leaders of former Soviet states had given huge payments to Trump family members. "" * Trump's defenders, such as Hannity, had claimed that Steele authored another dossier using Clinton contacts. But the memo was not written by Steele and thus it was a bold-faced lie. * Steele was shocked that Comey came out to say that the investigation into Clinton was being reopened and why one standard was applied to her and not her opponent. * Following the election Steele ""authorized a trusted mentor, Sir Andrew Wood, a former British Ambassador to Moscowto inform Senator John McCain of the existence of his dossier."" Wood said, ""it was simply a matter of duty."" * **On Jan 5, 2017, Obama and Biden finally learned of the existence of the dossier and the allegations that Trump's campaign colluded with the Russians.** * ""The main purpose of the Oval Office meeting was to run through a startling report that the U.S. intelligence chiefs were about to release to the public. It contained the agencies unanimous conclusion that, during the Presidential campaign, Putin had directed a cyber campaign aimed at getting Trump elected. "" * Biden asked ""how seriously should we take this?"" and was reassured by Comey that portions of it were consistent and that the FBI was confident in the author. * Comey said that he would meet with the president-elect the next day in order to protect him were the dossier become public. Nonetheless trump characterized it as Comey wanting to use the dossier as leverage. * Comey memorialized the meeting immediately after because of the ""nature of the person"" adding ""I was honestly concerned he might lie about the nature of our meeting."" * Four days after Trump was briefed, the dossier was leaked to BuzzFeed. * Simpson's Senate Judiciary testimony claims that ""somebodys already been killed as a result of the publication of this dossier."" * One possibility was ""Oleg Erovinkin, a former F.S.B. officer and top aide to Igor Sechin, the Rosneft president. On December 26, 2016, Erovinkin was found dead in his car."" * Steele met with Mueller in the Spring of 2017. * **One subject that Steele is believed to have discussed with Mueller's investigators, is a Nov 2016 memo in which a senior Russian official said ""that he was merely relaying talk circulating in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but what hed heard was astonishing: people were saying that the Kremlin had intervened to block Trumps initial choice for Secretary of State, Mitt Romney. ""** * ""The memo said that the Kremlin, through unspecified channels, had asked Trump to appoint someone who would be prepared to lift Ukraine-related sanctions, and who would cooperate on security issues of interest to Russia, such as the conflict in Syria. If what the source heard was true, then a foreign power was exercising pivotal influence over U.S. foreign policyand an incoming President."" --- ##CONCLUSIONS * Steele's critics allege that he lied to the FBI about talking to the press. But no charges have been filed by the Justice Dept. * Critics claim that the FBI tricked the FISA court into granting warrants to spy on Trump associates, but the FBI didn't trick the court - it openly disclosed that Steele's finding was political. It was also only part of what the FISA warrant rested on. There were multiple independent sources that corroborated Steele's reporting. * A number of major claims have been backed up by subsequent disclosures. Such as that the Kremlin favored Trump and was offering campaign dirt on Clinton. That the Kremlin and WikiLeaks were working together to release DNC emails. That Carter Page had secret meetings with Rosneft and Kremlin officials and was offered a ""potential sale of a significant percentage of Rosneft."" * Furthermore, ""damaging financial details have surfaced about Manaforts dealings with Ukraine officials. Further, his suggestion that Trump had agreed to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue seems to have been confirmed by the pro-Russia changes that Trump associates made to the Republican platform. Special Counsel Muellers various indictments of Manafort have also strengthened aspects of the dossier."" * **""John Sipher, the former C.I.A. officer, predicts that Muellers probe will render the final verdict on Steeles dossier. People who say its all garbage, or all true, are being politically biased, Sipher said. Theres enough there to be worthy of further study. Professionals need to look at travel records, phone records, bank records, foreign police-service cameras, and check it all out. It will take professional investigators to run it to ground. He believes that Mueller, whose F.B.I. he worked with, ""is a hundred per cent doing that.""""** "

URL &gt;Benczkowski explained to the senators that his work for the bank involved hiring and overseeing an internal investigation of its servers by the U.S.-based computer forensics firm Stroz Friedberg. The firm analyzed activity on the bank's servers in February and March 2017 to determine whether a hacker or other unknown actors infiltrated its systems. The investigators determined there was no evidence of communications between the bank and the Trump campaign in that time period. &gt;Also in his work for the bank, Benczkowski said he reviewed the so-called ""Steele dossier,"" an unverified file on alleged links between Russia and the Trump campaign. Benczkowski stressed he did not see the full dossier. He read the pages published by Buzzfeed News to consider whether the bank could sue Buzzfeed for defamation, which it did in May. &gt;Benczkowski once worked for Sessions in the Senate.

The Criminal Division, as I think most people know, is responsible for enforcement of all federal criminal law in our country. Its an important position for the rule of law in this country. &gt;We must assess today whether Mr. Benczkowski is qualified to lead this division. And that includes the propriety of his representation this year of Alfa Bank. This is the Russian bank that the media reported had been federally investigated for potential connections between its servers and the Trump Organization. &gt;I dont know what investigations there were, if any, so we have requested a briefing. And I want to thank the chairman for helping to facilitate that briefing with the Justice Department. &gt;I very much appreciate that Mr. Benczkowski has agreed to speak publicly about his work for Alfa Bank and I think its an important topic to understand given the position hes been nominated for. &gt;As I understand it, Mr. Benczkowski participated in President Trumps transition team from September of last year to January of this year. He led the transition teams work at the Justice Department, which is now led by his former boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions. &gt;Mr. Benczkowski told the committee that the retention of former FBI Director James Comey was discussed by those on the transition team, including himself. &gt;In March, within two months of leaving the transition team, Mr. Benczkowski agreed to represent Alfa Bank. &gt;Specifically, his work for Alfa Bank went to the heart of the reported investigations. He worked with a computer forensics firm to determine any ties between servers of Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization, and also whether and how private server information had gotten out of the ban. &gt;Additionally, he reviewed the Steele dossier, a private investigators file on alleged links between Russia and the Trump campaign. He did this for Alfa Bank to consider suing Buzz Feed for defamation over their online publication of the dossier. Alfa Bank, in fact, did sue Buzz Feed on May 26 of this year. &gt;In April, while Mr. Benczkowski was working for Alfa Bank, Attorney General Sessionss chief of staff asked him about his interest in leading the Criminal Division. &gt;Mr. Benczkowskis law firm then notified Alfa Bank of his potential nomination for the Trump administration. But the fact that Mr. Benczkowski continued representing Alfa Bank, until the day of his nomination, which was June 6, raises questions. After he found out about his potential nomination, why did he continue his representation of Alfa Bank? &gt;It is clear to me that Mr. Benczkowski is knowledgeable about issues related to an ongoing investigation. So I asked before this hearing if he would commit himself to recusingnot only from cases involving Alfa Bank as his former client, but also matters within Special Counsel Muellers investigation. &gt;He would not commit to recusing himself.

He escaped to Russia at one time to avoid charges that he laundered $40 million.

Some have characterized these as obfuscating the Russian interference and the DNC's insufficient cyber security and claim that Trump is down playing or down right denying the Russian interference.

The entire article should be read for context and scope. The below snippets inevitably leave a lot out. ""This account of the Obama administrations response to Russias interference is based on interviews with more than three dozen current and former U.S. officials in senior positions in government, including at the White House, the State, Defense and Homeland Security departments, and U.S. intelligence services. Most agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the issue."" Obama and only 3 others (Haines, Rice, McDonough) received ""an intelligence bombshell, a report drawn from sourcing deep inside the Russian government that detailed Putins direct involvement in a cyber campaign to disrupt and discredit the U.S. presidential race."" ""In political terms, Russias interference was the crime of the century, an unprecedented and largely successful destabilizing attack on American democracy. It was a case that took almost no time to solve, traced to the Kremlin through cyber-forensics and intelligence on Putins involvement. And yet, because of the divergent ways Obama and Trump have handled the matter, Moscow appears unlikely to face proportionate consequences."" In response to the report, originating in the CIA, ""Brennan convened a secret task force at CIA headquarters composed of several dozen analysts and officers from the CIA, the NSA and the FBI."" After initially informing Obama, ""Rice, Haines and White House homeland-security adviser Lisa Monaco convened meetings in the Situation Room to weigh the mounting evidence of Russian interference and generate options for how to respond. At first, only four senior security officials were allowed to attend: Brennan, Clapper, Lynch and Comey."" The administration floated several ideas, from ""sectorwide economic sanctions and cyberattacks that would take Russian networks temporarily offline"" to the espionage diplomatic compound seizure and removal of 35 spies and diplomats that was agreed upon after the election. Prior to the election ""The administration issued a series of warnings. Brennan delivered the first on Aug. 4 in a blunt phone call with Bortnikov, the director of the FSB."" Warning him not to carry out any interference actions. ""On Oct. 7th, the administration offered its first public comment on Russias active measures."" ""The statement was issued around 3:30 p.m., timed for maximum media coverage. Instead, it was quickly drowned out. At 4 p.m., The Post published a story about crude comments Trump had made about women that were captured on an ""Access Hollywood"" tape. Half an hour later, WikiLeaks published its first batch of emails stolen from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta."" The second warning was ""on Oct. 7, the day that the Clapper-Johnson statement was released. Rice summoned Kislyak to the White House and handed him a message to relay to Putin. Then, on Oct. 31, the administration delivered a final pre-election message via a secure channel to Moscow originally created to avert a nuclear exchange."" On Jan. 6 Obama commissioned a report release that made public what the CIA had concluded in August, that ""Putin and the Russian government aspired to help President-elect Trumps election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton."" A note of warning came with the report: ""We assess Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the U.S. election to future influence efforts worldwide."" Obama's administration did manage to implant cyber-weapons in Russian infrastructure that could be triggered remotely. ""The operation was described as long-term, taking months to position the implants and requiring maintenance thereafter. Under the rules of covert action, Obamas signature was all that was necessary to set the operation in motion. U.S. intelligence agencies do not need further approval from Trump, and officials said that he would have to issue a countermanding order to stop it. The officials said that they have seen no indication that Trump has done so.""

The loan was delivered just before the bank - which has long been under investigation by federal and state authorities - agreed to pay a $7.2 billion U.S. penalty in December for mortgage securities fraud in its packaging of residential mortgages. The bank also paid a $425 million New York state fine in January for failing to properly track large transfers from Russia.

He says, The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win and did not want to ""rock the boat."" He didn't ""choke,"" he colluded or obstructed, and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good. The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling. With 4 months looking at Russia under a magnifying glass, they have zero ""tapes"" of T people colluding. There is no collusion &amp; no obstruction. I should be given apology! Of course the claims that Obama did nothing are patently false since, as punishment, Obama instituted sanctions in December and took 2 diplomatic compounds used for espionage along with expelling 35 Russian operatives (sanctions Trump wants to lift and compounds he wants to return).

Now he is being questioned again by the FBI. This is the most extensive known questioning of a potential suspect in the bureaus investigations. Because it is against the law for an individual to lie to FBI agents about a material issue under investigation, many lawyers recommend that their clients not sit for interviews with the bureau without an attorney present. Page said he spoke without an attorney and wasnt concerned about the risks because he told the truth. In an unverified collection of memos, now known as the Trump-Russia dossier, accusing the Trump campaign of colluding with Russia, Page is alleged to be part of a well-developed conspiracy of cooperation between (Trump associates) and the Russian leadership. The dossier alleges that Igor Sechin, the CEO of Russia's state oil company Rosneft, offered Page the brokerage of a 19% stake in the company in exchange for the lifting of US sanctions on Russia when Page was in Moscow last July. Page worked in Russia for several years, [and] became the focus of attention after he delivered a speech at the New Economic School in Moscow in July 2016 advocating for better relations between the U.S. and Russia and criticized U.S. sanctions on Russia. The FBI obtained a secret FISA warrant  and has renewed it more than once  to monitor Page's communications last summer after he traveled to Moscow.  The FBIs application for the warrant, included a lengthy declaration that laid out investigators' basis for believing that Page was an agent of the Russian government and knowingly engaged in clandestine intelligence activities on behalf of Moscow.

The entire article should be read for context and scope. The below snippets inevitably leave a lot out. ""This account of the Obama administrations response to Russias interference is based on interviews with more than three dozen current and former U.S. officials in senior positions in government, including at the White House, the State, Defense and Homeland Security departments, and U.S. intelligence services. Most agreed to speak only on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the issue."" Obama and only 3 others (Haines, Rice, McDonough) received ""an intelligence bombshell, a report drawn from sourcing deep inside the Russian government that detailed Putins direct involvement in a cyber campaign to disrupt and discredit the U.S. presidential race."" ""In political terms, Russias interference was the crime of the century, an unprecedented and largely successful destabilizing attack on American democracy. It was a case that took almost no time to solve, traced to the Kremlin through cyber-forensics and intelligence on Putins involvement. And yet, because of the divergent ways Obama and Trump have handled the matter, Moscow appears unlikely to face proportionate consequences."" In response to the report, originating in the CIA, ""Brennan convened a secret task force at CIA headquarters composed of several dozen analysts and officers from the CIA, the NSA and the FBI."" After initially informing Obama, ""Rice, Haines and White House homeland-security adviser Lisa Monaco convened meetings in the Situation Room to weigh the mounting evidence of Russian interference and generate options for how to respond. At first, only four senior security officials were allowed to attend: Brennan, Clapper, Lynch and Comey."" The administration floated several ideas, from ""sectorwide economic sanctions and cyberattacks that would take Russian networks temporarily offline"" to the espionage diplomatic compound seizure and removal of 35 spies and diplomats that was agreed upon after the election. Prior to the election ""The administration issued a series of warnings. Brennan delivered the first on Aug. 4 in a blunt phone call with Bortnikov, the director of the FSB."" Warning him not to carry out any interference actions. ""On Oct. 7th, the administration offered its first public comment on Russias active measures."" ""The statement was issued around 3:30 p.m., timed for maximum media coverage. Instead, it was quickly drowned out. At 4 p.m., The Post published a story about crude comments Trump had made about women that were captured on an ""Access Hollywood"" tape. Half an hour later, WikiLeaks published its first batch of emails stolen from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta."" The second warning was ""on Oct. 7, the day that the Clapper-Johnson statement was released. Rice summoned Kislyak to the White House and handed him a message to relay to Putin. Then, on Oct. 31, the administration delivered a final pre-election message via a secure channel to Moscow originally created to avert a nuclear exchange."" On Jan. 6 Obama commissioned a report release that made public what the CIA had concluded in August, that ""Putin and the Russian government aspired to help President-elect Trumps election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton."" A note of warning came with the report: ""We assess Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the U.S. election to future influence efforts worldwide."" Obama's administration did manage to implant cyber-weapons in Russian infrastructure that could be triggered remotely. ""The operation was described as long-term, taking months to position the implants and requiring maintenance thereafter. Under the rules of covert action, Obamas signature was all that was necessary to set the operation in motion. U.S. intelligence agencies do not need further approval from Trump, and officials said that he would have to issue a countermanding order to stop it. The officials said that they have seen no indication that Trump has done so.""

By midweek, 44 states and DC refused to provide some or all of the voter roll data requested by Trumps Election Integrity Commission. 3. States are denying the request based on concerns over privacy and federal overreach, and also concern that the effort of identifying voter affiliation will be used to purge Democrats from voter rolls. 4. The Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law filed a Hatch Act complaint against Kobach, saying he used Trumps commission to solicit political campaign money. 5. A Maryland official, Deputy SoS Luis Borunda, resigned from Trumps commission. 6. Several experts on the regulatory process told The Hill that Trumps commission may have violated the law by failing to submit the requests to states through OIRA, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act. 7. A DOJ letter sent to 44 states election officials on the same day Kobach and Pence made their requests, asks states to detail their compliance with the NVRA. This request also raised concerns about voter purging. 8. At a rally in DC Saturday night, Trump continued his attacks on the fake media, saying, Im President and theyre not. 9.

As Trump continued his anti-CNN rhetoric, the cable networks anchors and executives received death threats and other harassing messages. 13. Following Trumps tweet, three media watchdog groups have started to do something they never imagined: documenting violent threats and actions against the media in the US. 14. Maines Governor LePage said he makes up stories to mislead the press. LePage also called the media vile and inaccurate. 15.

Maddow speculated this was an attempt to trick her show into reporting a false story, and hence weakening her credibility and dulling that storyline. 19. Maddow said that other media outlets may also be receiving forged documents as well, citing recently retracted stories at CNN and Vice. 20.

Also on his trip to Poland, Trump continued to dismiss and belittle US intelligence, saying, Do we even have seventeen intelligence agencies? 80. The day before Trump was set to meet with Putin, seemingly as a bargaining chip, The Moscow Times reported the Russian embassy to the US is accusing the US of kidnapping a man accused of cyber-fraud. 81.

Tillersons version differed, but both said they agreed to put whatever happened behind them: There was not a lot of re-litigating of the past. Tillerson added, This is a very important relationship. 90. Russia faces no consequences from Trump for interfering in our election. It was unclear if Trump returned the two Russian compounds seized by Obama as punishment for Russia interfering in our election. 91. In an op-ed, Trump Caves to Putin, conservative journalist Stephen Hayes laid out an indictment of how Trump bowed to Putin on Russian interference and foreign policy. Elected Republicans however were silent. 92. AP reported Saturday that Putin said, he thinks Trump believes his denial of Russian meddling in US vote, but better to ask Trump himself. 93. Ivanka took her fathers seat at a G20 meeting on Saturday. Normally, government ministers or senior officials would take such a role. 94.

According to the NSA she was only one of six people who had viewed the intelligence report since it was published internally. ""While the document provides a rare window into the NSAs understanding of the mechanics of Russian hacking, it does not show the underlying raw intelligence on which the analysis is based."" The Intelligence community's previous ""assessment concluded with high confidence that the Kremlin ordered an extensive, multi-pronged propaganda effort to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency."" ""The NSA has now learned, however, that Russian government hackers, part of a team with a cyber espionage mandate specifically directed at U.S. and foreign elections, focused on parts of the system directly connected to the voter registration process, including a private sector manufacturer of devices that maintain and verify the voter rolls. Some of the companys devices are advertised as having wireless internet and Bluetooth connectivity, which could have provided an ideal staging point for further malicious actions."" [Overview chart detailing the Russian governments spear-phishing operation, apparently missing a second page that was not provided to The Intercept](URL [A detail from a top-secret NSA report on a Russian military intelligence operation targeting the U.S. election infrastructure](URL ""On August 24, 2016, the Russian hackers sent spoofed emails purporting to be from Google to employees of a U.S. election software company."" The spear-phishing successfully compromised at least one employee. ""On October 27, they set up an operational Gmail account designed to appear as if it belonged to an employee at VR Systems, and used documents obtained from the previous operation to launch a second spear-phishing operation targeting U.S. local government organizations."" ""On either October 31 or November 1 and sent spear-fishing emails to 122 email addresses associated with named local government organizations, probably to officials involved in the management of voter registration systems. At a December press conference, Obama said, So in early September, when I saw President Putin in China, I felt that the most effective way to ensure that that didnt happen was to talk to him directly and tell him to cut it out and there were going to be serious consequences if he didnt. And in fact we did not see further tampering of the election process."" NSA documents confirm that the ""Russian attacks continued after the Department of Homeland Security publicly attributed the meddling to Russia's intelligence agencies, confirming that those statements did not deter more cyberattacks, and after Obama's warning to Putin in September"" ""There is no strong central government oversight of the election process or the acquisition of voting hardware or software. Likewise, voter registration, maintenance of voter rolls, and vote counting lack any effective national oversight. There is no single authority with the responsibility for safeguarding elections."" Schneier, a cybersecurity expert at Harvards Berkman Center, said, ""Elections do two things: one choose the winner, and two, they convince the loser. To the extent the elections are vulnerable to hacking, we risk the legitimacy of the voting process, even if there is no actual hacking at the time.""

Previous NSA reports stated that ""Russian influence during the 2016 election was gauged to be a largely covert operation. This latest document suggests that Putin's activities were far more overt."" The document ""reveals that a hacking group linked to Russia was also directly targeting US voting infrastructure."" ""According to the NSAs assessment, the group was 'probably trying to obtain information associated with election-related hardware and software applications.' "" The document reportedly states: Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate actors  executed cyber espionage operations against a named U.S. company in August 2016, evidently to obtain information on elections-related software and hardware solutions.  The actors likely used data obtained from that operation to  launch a voter registration-themed spear-phishing campaign targeting US local government organizations. The report ""described the Russian spear-phishing scheme, one it described as perpetrated by the same intelligence agency  the GRU  that the Obama administration imposed sanctions on for the 2016 cyber mischief."" ""The NSA found that there were seven ""potential victims"" and at least one person's account was likely phished for user credentials. WIth this access the hackers launched ""a separate phishing attack targeting 122 local election officials."" This 2nd round of phishing, if successful may have introduced malware onto the officials' computer, taking control of it. The NSA doesn't know how successful the efforts were or what info GRU may have gotten. ""While the machines that voters use to cast their ballots are not connected to the Internet, the computers used to program these machines, or to run elections, can be connected at some point, leaving them vulnerable to cyberattacks"" The document said, ""Russian intelligence obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple U.S. state or local electoral boards.

You could check and say, 'Oh no, all these people already voted, or these people voted absentee.' Once you get into that, then there's all kind of mischief."" Quigley cant go further because the leaked document is top secret and was anonymously given to The Intercept. No information was manipulated by hackers.

""Two days earlier, Comey had confirmed in a congressional hearing that the bureau was probing whether Trumps campaign coordinated with Russia during the 2016 race.""

Again, Coats decided not to act on the request."" Trump also allegedly asked Rogers for the same thing.

Comey viewed such private interactions and requests inappropriate. ""Comey had disclosed the meeting to a few of his closest advisers but nobody at the Justice Department."" ""Comey kept his interactions with Mr. Trump a secret in part because he was not sure whom at the Justice Department he could trust.""

""A consistent theme was the concern about whether the president would accept the advice of his lawyers and refrain from public statements and tweets that have consistently undercut his position. The concerns were, The guy wont pay and he wont listen, said one lawyer close to the White House who is familiar with some of the discussions between the firms and the administration, as well as deliberations within the firms themselves."" Other law firms were ""worried about the reputational risk of representing the president.

In it he summarizes his interactions with Trump. On January 6, Comey met Trump for the first time at Trump Tower. There he informed Trump of the dossier and assured him that the FBI is not investigating him. Comey writes that he felt the need to create a written account after every such interaction because he believed the exchanges needed to be carefully detailed and preserved. He writes, ""I felt compelled to document my first conversation with the President-Elect in a memo. To ensure accuracy, I began to type it on a laptop in an FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment I walked out of the meeting. Creating written records immediately after one-on-one conversations with Mr. Trump was my practice from that point forward. This had not been my practice in the past."" On Jan 27th Comey was invited to a one-on-one dinner with Trump. There Trump asked him for loyalty twice, to which Comey responded that he can give Trump honesty. Comey writes, ""I wrote a detailed memo about the dinner immediately afterwards and shared it with the senior leadership team of the FBI."" On Feb 14th Trump asked Pence and Sessions to leave the room to privately tell Comey, ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go."" Comey writes, ""I had understood the President to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December."" Comey told Sessions not to leave him alone with Trump. On March 30th, Trump called Comey. Comey writes, ""He described the Russia investigation as a cloud that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country. He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia."" Trump ""asked why there had been a congressional hearing about Russia the previous week  at which I had, as the Department of Justice directed, confirmed the investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. I explained the demands from the leadership of both parties in Congress for more information"". Trump asked him to ""get out"" the fact that he is not under investigation. ""In their final conversation -- a phone call from Trump to Comey on April 11 -- the president again sought to secure Comey's loyalty, according to the former FBI Director's re-telling."" He also asked him what Comey had done to ""get out"" the message that he's not under investigation and that ""the cloud"" [of the Russian investigation] ""was getting in the way of his ability to do his job."" Comey recommended he go through the traditional channel of the Acting Deputy Attorney General. ""He said he would do that and added, ""Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know."" I did not reply or ask him what he meant by ""that thing.""

States that by 2008 technology changed considerably. Emails proliferated and instead of satellites we were using fiber optic cables. FISA helped with collection with these new technologies. Reverse-targeting prevents Intelligence Agencies from targeting a US person from being targeted via a foreign person. Rogers was asked: ""What would be the effects on national security if the statutory powers of 702 were reduced?"" Rogers: ""Well I wouldn't have generated the same insight on Russian interference in the election."" The hearing was about FISA section 702 that gives the NSA authority to gather surveillance data on foreign nationals which may incidentally include participating US citizens. However the hearing also veered into the previous day's reports that Trump asked Coats, Pompeo, and Rogers to assist him in having Comey let go of the Flynn investigation. Coats and Rogers chose their words carefully as they stated that they never felt pressured into doing anything illegal or immoral. However as the Senators pressed on throughout the hearing, Coats and Rogers amended with Coats saying, ""I do not feel it's appropriate for me in a public session to address that ... This is not the appropriate venue for me to do that ... when I was asked to respond to the Washington Post story, my response was that in my time 'I have never been pressured or felt pressured to intervene in any way to shape intelligence in a political way."" Coats further stated, ""just because it's been reported, doesn't mean that it isn't still classified."" RUBIO: ""Did the President ever ask you to influence an investigation?""

Rogers says that he doesn't think he has one and that he looks forward to having this dialogue about conversations with Trump, in a closed setting.

Witch Hunt"" However he ""contradicted himself again about his decision to fire Comey"" according to his statement to Lester Holt in May when he said, he was going to fire Comey regardless of Rosenstein's memos. It also contradicts his reasons when he made the confirmed statements to the Russians in the Oval Office that he felt ""great pressure from Russia and now that's off."" Several questions come up as a result of this statement that news outlets, pundits and politicians have attempted to answer. Is this related to Rosenstein's vague late night statement last night for Americans to ""exercise caution before accepting as true any stories attributed to anonymous officials', ... ""Americans should be skeptical about anonymous allegations."" Who is Trump talking about? His focus was apparently on Rosenstein, though Trump ""never used his name, and his tweet oversimplified and misstated the truth. Rosenstein is supervising the investigation, not conducting it. And Trump has said he decided to fire Comey before he received Rosensteins memo"" and regardless of it. If he's talking about Mueller, there's no indication that he told Trump to fire Comey. So, as the Washington Post writes, it is safest to assume he is referring to Rosenstein "" and trying to impugn his deputy attorney general by ensnaring him in the firing of Comey at the outset."" This ensnaring raised concerns that Rosenstein may need to recuse himself because he is now alleged by Trump to be involved in the investigation and thus shouldn't have authority over firing Mueller (which only he has). The next in line at the DOJ would be Rachel Brand, Associate Attorney General. ""The DNC called for Rosensteins recusal and urged DOJ to bypass other Trump appointees and hand the matter to a career official."" A DOJ spokesman said, ""As the deputy attorney general has said numerous times, if there comes a point when he needs to recuse, he will. However, nothing has changed."" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, in a statement, said, ""I'm growing increasingly concerned that the President will attempt to fire not only Mueller, the special counsel investigating possible obstruction of justice, but also Rosenstein who appointed Mueller ... The message the president is sending through his tweets is that he believes the rule of law doesn't apply to him and that anyone who thinks otherwise will be fired. That's undemocratic on its face and a blatant violation of the president's oath of office ... If the president thinks he can fire Rosenstein and replace him with someone who will shut down the investigation, hes in for a rude awakening. Even his staunchest supporters will balk at such a blatant effort to subvert the law."" An hour after Trump's tweet, Rosenstein ""addressed a crowd of several hundred people in the Justice Departments great hall, saying, ""The pursuit of justice is never a 9-to-5 endeavor. I will continue to work alongside all of you to make this department and our country stronger and better.""

The New York Times reported that Cohen said he took the plan and left it in the White House office of then national security adviser Michael Flynn, days before Flynn resigned over his contacts with Russia's ambassador.

Beyond personal information like religion, age, and probable ethnicity, certain database files among those made public include individual scores for nearly 50 different beliefs, according to UpGuards analysis: Each of fields under each of the forty-eight columns signifies the potential voters modeled likelihood of supporting the policy, political candidate, or belief listed at the top of the column, with zero indicating very unlikely, and one indicating very likely. Calculated for 198 million potential voters, this adds up to a spreadsheet of 9.5 billion modeled probabilities, for questions ranging from how likely it is the individual voted for Obama in 2012, whether the agree with the Trump foreign policy of ""America First,"" and how likely they are to be concerned with auto manufacturing as an issue, among others.""

Reps. Cummings &amp; Engel, ranking members of the House Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees, in a letter appeared to focus on evidence that they said suggested Flynn repeatedly misled investigators about his overseas work during the period after 2014. ""Flynns previously undisclosed foreign work extended much further than previously revealed. During the summer of 2015, the letter says, Flynn traveled to the Middle East to pursue the nuclear venture  a trip he did not disclose."" ""He reported another trip, to Saudi Arabia, in October 2015 on security clearance forms, but the letter says he omitted key details of that trip, including who paid for it. He said he traveled with a ""friend,"" whom he did not identify, had a speaking engagement that could not be confirmed by the agencies that booked his speeches and stayed at the King Khaled International Hotel, the letter says. Congressional investigators could find no evidence that such a hotel existed."" They wrote, ""Most troubling of all, we have no record of Gen. Flynn identifying on his security clearance renewal application  or during his interview with security clearance investigators  even a single foreign government official he had contact with in the seven years prior to submitting his security clearance application.""
