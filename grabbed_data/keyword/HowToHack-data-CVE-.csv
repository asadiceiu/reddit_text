I had to record this three times because of some technical issues but its finally up. Heres the link and I just want to say thanks to the members in this community for providing some great questions. I got 60 questions in total and couldnt get to them all but I tried my best to make a good video on it. Heres the link: URL If you want to see what questions I answered heres the full list as well: - First Round: The Getting Started Questions - Anonymous What technologies / tools do you recommend? What level of in-depth networking knowledge is necessary? Reddit user /u/lonezombywolf I'm an older guy 28 and have always wanted to get into hacking but have never been super technically fluent with computers. I've recently been learning a lot more especially after ditching Windows for Linux. Two questions I have are how strong of a networking background do you need for hacking? And is this something I'll be able to grasp or will it be over my head? I have recently been learning a little about networking and just how much I didn't know lol. Thanks again for taking the time to share what you know Instagram User @suneel_abireddi Best resources for basics areas needs to covered before starting hacking? /u/UR_legit What are some jobs in the security industry other than penetration testing? /u/deepus For me as much information you can give regarding the actual jobs would be great. Like what's the average day of a pen tester, what's the average day of a blue or red team member. Info that could help us choose what path we would want to do down and how to get there /u/EducationalPair How do you move from general IT Support into a security role? /u/gullywasteman (if you're uk based) what sort of ways are there of getting into the industry? So far my biggest lead is CREST Instagram user @ xlbertgm17 Certs? Where and when to start training? Books? Depends on where you are and if your office will fund Beginning? Comptia Sec+ and Net+ are great Ive heard about their more security focused one and I think they even have a pentest plus now but I cant speak for them Instagram user @edo_tensei_2.0 Can I depend on those udemy courses for hacking and do you have any course suggestions? Sometimes. I feel like theres better material on youtube though Also asks, Can I learn for OSCP for free? I dont need to take the exam, I just want to learn You can learn everything covered on it for free from open source knowledge. But not the course itself Hacking and Cyber Specific ThrowAway How can I reduce reliance on metasploit? Use searchsploit and exploit-db to find the original exploit scripts, read through them and pay attention to the comments and processes then use though How can I start to recognize vulnerabilities aside from ones listed in CVE and elsewhere? In other words, how can I recognize vulnerabilities in software without help from outside databases? How can I learn to translate CVE vulnerabilities into actual exploits? I'll see CVE entries reference things like buffer overflows to mod_ssl and have no idea how to translate that into an actual exploit. /u/wardyward42 One I've always kind of had is do you have a recommended path for certain types of hacking (eg. Penetrating, security analyst, hobbiest, bug hunting, etc) /u/hugo-guenebaut What is SQL injection and is it something i can learn as Im just starting or should i wait until i know more Different video /u/-_-qarma-_- The benefits of using something like Ubuntu over kali to only get the tools you need(building your own hacking machine) I think it's useful since as a beginner you learn a lot doing this, and you download tools as you need them. Meaning you know how to use everything Install the tools as you go and its a struggle /u/gullywasteman I've installed kali linux on a usb. I haven't yet had a look around on it, but have been wondering if it's too advanced for a beginner? Never too advanced, itll be a struggle but youll learn What coding languages are essential? I've set out to learn a new one over summer. Python is a pretty solid one to start with in my opinion. You dont need to be an expert in coding but you should understand coding principles and structures /u/swagalicious786 Quick question, how do decide what your next step is while cracking these boxes? Is it just plain as day? Im more of a beginner so Im tryna get some insight. Misc /u/Deoxal More seriously how do you schedule your time to learn to hack? Before I had a full time job I wasted most of my time playing videogames, I wanted to mod them but I couldn't bring myself to put in the work. I also felt pretty bad about not having a job which contributed to my lack of motivation to pursue hobbies. Now I do have a job but it is quite exhausting so the time I do have at home often goes into playing Brawlstars, a game I want to mod. My two brothers had very strong ADD, they weren't good at school but could really focus on their hobbies which they turned into careers. I on the otherhand was pretty good learning from books in school but can't focus on useful hobbies now."

The person who found the information would like to notify the company who has (likely unintentionally) published this information about the exposure so that it can be fixed. The person who found the information doesn't want to be sued, prosecuted, or accused of wrongdoing. The person who found the information isn't seeking compensation and has no interest in exposing innocent people's private information to the Internet. The person who found the information wouldn't mind being credited for the discovery (by real name or pseudonym) because the person is interested in working in infosec but it's not critical.

WhatsApp has been discovered to have a critical vulnerability that could have allowed attackers to remotely access files from a Windows or Mac computer. The vulnerability, which has been fixed by Facebook, could be exploited using the WhatsApp desktop application. It was a mix of multiple high-severity flaws that existed within the WhatsApp desktop application. Some of those flaws were also a part of the WhatsApp Web client that works on Web browsers. The vulnerability essentially allowed for [cross-site scripting (XSS)](URL that could be used by remote attackers. PerimeterX researcher Gal Weizman discovered the WhatsApp vulnerability that has been tracked as CVE-2019-18426. The researcher stated that the security loophole existed within the Content Security Policy (CSP) of WhatsApp that allowed for XSS attacks on the desktop app. The flaw in the CSP also impacted the WhatsApp Web client to some extent as it provided space to alter rich preview banners with malicious content. The researcher in a blog post mentioned that the Web client was vulnerable to an open redirect flaw that could have led to persistent cross-site scripting attacks triggered by sending specially crafted messages to WhatsApp users. However, the scope of the loophole is found to be quite wider on the WhatsApp desktop application over what was discovered on its Web client. The researcher found that he was able to read the file system and identify the remote code execution (RCE) potential on the desktop application. The only thing that the affected WhatsApp users had to do was to click on the specially crafted message to provide backdoor access to attackers. read more [WhatsApp Bug](URL"

42,CVE-,HowToHack,Where do I get the latest next gen tools? Github? CVE? Exploit-DB? Or is it so secret I have to resort to the dark web going into the darknet market with tor?,10,58a9ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/58a9ci/where_do_i_get_the_latest_next_gen_tools_github/,2016-10-20 00:29:03,If you dont want to outright say it I understand PM me in that case ;) Well before you white knights go rampant let this dark knight say something this is just for challenging purposes I would be beta testing the software on my virtualized OS and see what kind of tweaks can be made to nullify it completely. I just want to test the limits of security and see whether hackers overtrump security or vice versa. I don't want to spend 20 years testing this theory I would rather it take 2 years. I know some people sell exploits for money but is there a depot/repository that offers them for free even in the onion sites. And do please give me a URL or a onion link. I wanna start coding to patch these next gen pentesting tools instead of wasting my time on already patched systems. And zigzag like that between hacking and security. Thanks.
43,CVE-,HowToHack,"When the vulnerability is found, where to look up to find a respective exploit?",33,4ohe8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack/comments/4ohe8b/when_the_vulnerability_is_found_where_to_look_up/,2016-06-17 13:46:49,"DISCLAIMER: I'm just a noob in the process of learning So my friend gave me permission to play with his site. Used tools such as `nikto` and `websploit`, but nothing exceptional came in there, all I could find is the phpMyadmin login page plus some false positives. So I had to move on to something else, so I tried to do port scanning, and here are the results: PORT STATE SERVICE 25/tcp filtered smtp 80/tcp open http 111/tcp filtered rpcbind 135/tcp filtered msrpc 139/tcp filtered netbios-ssn 443/tcp open https 445/tcp filtered microsoft-ds 544/tcp filtered kshell 3306/tcp open mysql 5800/tcp filtered vnc-http 5900/tcp filtered vnc This surprised me, as I was mostly in my tests finding only http and https as open ports, so here we have mysql. So I went up to `metasploit` and tried the mysql_login exploit, but even by trying multiple pass_lists, I couldn't get there. So I thought about determining the MySQL version running on the server, perhaps it's an old one and it may contain some vulnerability? So using the mysql_version exploit, I found the version to be: MySQL 5.5.47 (protocol 10). So I looked up online, and happened on this [site](URL and among the vulnerabilities listed there, there's a very interesting one: CVE-2016-0705 : Double free vulnerability in the dsa_priv_decode function in crypto/dsa/dsa_ameth.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a malformed DSA private key. I've been now searching for so long for an exploit that uses this vulnerability, but all I could find is some bug fix reports from Oracle, openSUSE, ...etc that reference it perhaps i need to learn more and actually make my own exploit for this? My question is twofold * What would one basically do at this point? * In general, what are the best sites (other than exploit-db) to look for exploits for particular vulnerabilities? would appreciate any help and sorry if this seems to be too broad"

Assume person hosting the server is your average network admin who just updates when told to by Windows. Bonus points for creativity.
