F5 released the patch June 30. Much like Apache Struts (led to Equifax mega-breach), this F5 issue has all the hallmarks of an impending major cyber incident (I hope not). 30 days is easy to patch for home devices, but large enterprises always have to struggle with downtime, change control, communication, and resources to commit to doing the action. For an issue like this, its frustrating that the urgency and criticality of applying these patches cannot be better conveyed holistically to enterprises (the business side). I'm certain some orgs are applying, but the fact that CISA is issuing a notification on it being a major issue, urging orgs to patch or at minimum put in (SNORT) IDS rules to detect compromise shows its an issue. This issue does not affect me professionally, but as I'm seeing the alerts and news day after day, it just 'feels' like the Apache Struts or the SMBv1 (Eternal Blue) CVE-2017-0144 one when WannaCry ripped up the EU back in 2017 months after the patch was released by MSFT. **What effective ways have you been able to improve/facilitate/champion vulnerability management in your experience?** \-Gerry &amp;#x200B; \[1\][URL \[2\] [URL \[3\] [URL"

I've tried some scanners, like clair and trivy, which I like a lot so far. It so happens that both find a lot of vulnerabilities in the debian:latest docker image (80, 1 of them critical). An image based on debian I tested had way more even when running a apt-get upgrade. I suggested using alpine as base image because of the smaller attack surface in general, but a colleague mentioned that with debian there's usually a lot of false positives as versions wouldn't always reflect already patched software. According to URL there's only 1 non-kernel package with unfixed CVEs and low urgency for debian stable. Now the question(s): In what way is that true or could even be possible? Is there something I don't regard in terms of how the scanner works that would produce (so many) false positives? Are clair or trivy just not suitable for debian based images? Do you have any general advice regarding this issue?

Social Graph Analysis and Attribution of Software Exploit Contributors Using GitHub (Supervisor: Jeremy Abramson) Attribution of threat actors is an increasingly important and difficult problem. One potential mitigation is the early detection of potential threat actors via analysis of open-source intelligence (OSINT). This project will analyze the social graph of users who contribute to, follow, star, and otherwise interact with proof-of-concept CVE implementations and other relevant potentially malicious (e.g. software vulnerability) repositories. # 2. Textual, Structural and Semantic Analysis of Phishing Datasets (Supervisor: Jeremy Abramson) Phishing attacks  both specifically and broadly targeted  are an increasingly dangerous vector for malice. Because of the textual and semantic similarities between potentially malicious and benign emails, detection of subtle phishing attacks can be difficult. This project aims to provide a high-level textual and structural analysis of different phishing datasets to determine what features in a conversational chain may be useful in increasing detection of phishing attacks. Students will work on textual extraction of features (intent, sentiment, tone, etc.) and analysis of externally verifiable content (company affiliation, etc.). # 3. Detecting Malware Campaign Lifecycles from Behavioral Analysis (Supervisor: Jeremy Abramson) This project aims to detect and coalesce families of malware articles and campaigns by analyzing their behavior and interactions with the outside world. Features such as network activity, system component interactions and others can be used to cluster malware articles and determine the duration of malware campaigns otherwise thought to be independent. Students will work on Exploration of open-source malware API contents (e.g. VirusTotal), construction of malware behavioral data set, generation of similarity metrics (network traffic access patterns, system interactions, etc.) and analysis and clustering of malware articles and campaigns. ELLIGIBILTY: To apply, students must meet the following criteria at the time of application: * US citizens or permanent residents * enrolled at an accredited higher learning institution (including two-year institutions) * be at least in their second year of study (exceptional freshmen may be considered) * not be in their last year of study for the given undergraduate degree (i.e. rising sophomores to rising seniors) Timeline Applications due: Feb 1, 2020 (NOTE: If you're *extremely* interested, please contact me for an extension) Acceptance notifications:Feb 15 - Mar 1, 2020 Program duration:May 31 - July 25, 2020 GENERAL INFO: In our program, students will participate in an 8-week research experience at USC/ISI campus in Marina del Rey. The program includes: * a weekly stipend of $500 * travel reimbursement to/from Los Angeles * meals * housing at USC campus * free shuttle between USC and ISI * professional development activities * social events in the Los Angeles area"

The malware targets web servers, network drives and removable drives using eight different exploit and brute force attacks. More precisely, the software in question employs EternalBlue; DoublePulsar; the exploits for CVE-2014-6287, CVE-2017-12615, and CVE-2017-8464; and three ThinkPHP exploits for multiple versions. While it installs the XMRig monero (XMR) Central Processing Unit-based mining software, BlackSquid could also deliver other payloads in the future. According to Trend Micro data, most of the instances of the malware in question have been detected in Thailand and the United States. The malware can reportedly infect a system via three different routes: through a website hosted on an infected server, exploits, and removable or network drives. BlackSquid also cancels the infection protocol if it detects that the username, device driver or the disk drive model suggests that the software is running in a sandbox environment. It has also been reported that as many as 50,000 servers worldwide have allegedly been infected with an advanced cryptojacking malware that mines the privacy-focused open source cryptocurrency turtlecoin (TRTL). Cybercriminals are also now exploiting known vulnerability CVE-2019-3396 for crypto mining in the software Confluence, a workspace productivity tool made by Atlassian.

The team tested multiple aspects of six mid-range enterprise printers, including web application and web services, firmware and update capabilities, along with hardware analysis. The printersmanufactured by HP, Ricoh, Xerox, Lexmark, Kyocera and Brotherwere tested using basic tools, some dating back 40 years. The research uncovered a wide range of vulnerabilities, including some that emerged almost instantly. The findings, which will be presented by NCC Group at DEF CON, Hack in the Box and 44Con, range in severity, but the potential impact ranges from denial of service attacks that could cause the printers to crash, backdoors within compromised printers to maintain a hidden presence on the network, and the ability to spy on every print job sent and send print jobs through to unauthorised parties. All of the vulnerabilities discovered have either been patched, or will be. System administrators are advised to update all vulnerable printers with the latest firmware, and monitor further updates. Because printers have been around for so long, theyre not seen as enterprise IoT devicesbut theyre embedded in corporate networks and therefore pose a significant risk, said Matt Lewis, research director at NCC Group. Building security into the development lifecycle would mitigate most if not all of these vulnerabilities. Its very important that manufacturers continue to invest in security for all devices, just as corporate IT teams should guard against IoT-related vulnerabilities with even small change: changing default settings, enforcing secure configuration guides and regularly updating firmware. A blog post about the research findings is available at URL ENDS Notes to editors The research team was made up of Daniel Romero, managing security consultant and research lead, and Mario Rivas, security consultant at NCC Group.
