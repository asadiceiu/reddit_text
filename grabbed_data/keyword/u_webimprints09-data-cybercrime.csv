Last November, for example, a group of hackers known as [**The Dark Overlord**](URL began circulating an ad through various hacking forums; Do you want to get rich? Join us, the ad mentioned. The Dark Overlord is a renowned cybercriminals group focused primarily on data theft and extortion of thousands of victims. This gang is just one of countless criminal hacker groups that keep using multiple darknet forums to recruit new members and continue selling stolen data, extortion and attack on websites. **Network management and programming skills** According to [**network security**](URL experts, The Dark Overlord is recruiting hackers with at least 10 years of experience in specific areas, such as application design and network management on Windows and Linux systems, as well as programming in the most used languages. You must have at least 10 years of experience in network management or programming, this requirement is not negotiable, mentions the announcement of the group of hackers. We do not accept freelancers; you must prove at least 5 years of experience working in a cooperative environment. In addition, you should be able to provide innovative approaches to our regular activities, concludes the announcement. The criminal group offers its new full-time employees a monthly salary close to $65k USD, with the possibility of increasing to $90k USD after two years of work, as reported by the network security experts. **Higher salaries for multilingual hackers** Malicious hackers with multilingual communication and programming skills could get better payments. According to the announcement, The Dark Overlord would pay an extra 5% to the salaries or commissions of hackers with additional language domain, especially German, Arabic and Chinese. **Diversifying dissemination methods** Criminal organizations like The Dark Overlord are not only looking for individuals with advanced computer skills and knowledge. Such groups also need to recruit staff to cover positions that do not require the least knowledge of hacking; some people, for example, are recruited to deploy propaganda outside the darknet (using graffiti, for example) to disseminate information about Telegram groups, key names for drug and weapon sales forums, among other activities. Other non-specialized works for which cybercriminals require personnel is data entering and manual CAPTCHA solution. Although to a lesser extent than a job as a hacker, these jobs can be very lucrative, especially for students or young people without occupation. In countries like Ukraine, for example, a job as a CAPTCHA solver is close to $150 USD a month, much higher than the scholarship of an average of $60 USD per month that Ukrainian students can apply for. Despite the risks of enrolling in this kind of activity, there are many people willing to collaborate with cybercrime. According to a report by cybersecurity specialists, three of the four hacker vacancies that the Dark Overlord announced were covered only a few days after the ad was published. "

To counter the activities of these groups, law enforcement agencies across Europe, led by **Europol**, implemented a coordinated operation through 13 countries to combat this kind of crimes. According to specialists in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, this operation was launched last November, with agencies across Europe chasing multiple members of gangs dedicated to money laundering and other crimes throughout dark web. Europol stated through a press release that 235 people were arrested during this operation, mostly for crimes related to money counterfeiting. In addition, the agency reported that 300 houses were raided. A key factor for the success of this operation was the carelessness of one of the suspects, as their limited security measures allowed a data leaking that the agencies used to track an illegal transaction. Thanks to unencrypted information, it was easier for agencies to identify gang members involved in money counterfeit. According to experts in digital forensics, the operators of this scam received payments in cryptocurrency, but they managed a record of their clients email addresses. In addition to the arrests performed, the authorities seized almost two thousand euro banknotes of various denominations, as well as multiple weapons, drugs, hardware for cryptojacking, computers, smartphones and virtual assets (Bitcoin). On the other hand, the French police discovered two facilities dedicated to the cultivation of marijuana and an illegal print shop. 2018 has been a prominent year in the fight against dark web crimes. Last June, the Austrian authorities shut down a dark web portal and succeeded in arresting its operators in an operation run by the Austrian Federal Police Office and Europol. During this operation, a counterfeit euro printing press was also shut in Leoben, Austria. This installation had the necessary resources to print banknotes of 10, 20 and 50 euro; according to the authorities estimates, before shut down, the criminals had printed about 10k. However, cybersecurity and [**digital forensics**](URL specialists believe that the fight against counterfeiting in dark web has just begun, as similar services can still be found available in multiple forums dedicated to cybercrime around the world. This joint operation is the sign that there is no such thing as absolute anonymity on the Internet. If you carry out illicit activities online, sooner or later police agents will be knocking at your door, says Wil van Gemert, operation officer from Europol. The agency will continue to work with the Member States to combat this kind of crime, said the official."

According to a recent report we have received, data of almost all Pakistani banks have been hacked, said retired Captain Mohammad Shoaib, director of Cybercrime area at the FIA last Tuesday. The comment made by Captain Mohammad Shoaib came after the discovery made by the information security firm about a new deposit of Pakistani credit and debit cards in [dark web](URL forums. The agency is investigating more than 100 cases related to this security breach. Over 100 cases have been registered in the FIA and are under investigation. We have made several related arrests, including an international gang of hackers, said Captain Shoaib. The data found in dark web forums include 20k debit card details from Pakistani citizens. The data belongs to clients of most of the banks operating in the country, according to reports of specialists in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security. Captain Shoaib mentioned that hackers behind the security breach are operating outside Pakistani territory and attacking multiple banking institutions. Large sums of money have been stolen from peoples accounts, he added. This recent attack has made it quite clear that it is necessary to improve the security system of our banks. The FIA notified its findings to all the banks of the country and convened a meeting with its representatives with the intention of responding to the incident, mitigating the damage and improving the security of the banks in general. Banks are responsible for protecting the money that people choose to store in them, Shoaib said. They are also responsible if their security measures are so weak that they facilitate access to malicious agents. It is still unclear when the security breach occurred and how the attackers gained access to banking systems. Pakistani banks face a serious security emergency, last week a cyber attack on Bank Islami allowed attackers to steal at least 2.6 million of Pakistani rupees from their accounts (about $20k USD). Last weekend, some Pakistani banks suspended the use of their debit cards out of the country, and blocked all international transactions made with their cards. One of Pakistans most important financial institutions informed its customers that its online mobile banking services would be temporarily suspended from November 3 until a new notice. The Pakistan governments information security and [digital forensics](URL team published a report detailing the extent of data leaking, as well as a possible timeline. The government experts believe that the data was obtained through the technique of cloning payment cards known as card skimming. According to the report, the first card database was put on sale on the site JokerStash. These databases, identified as PAKISTANWORLD-EU-MIX-01, contain over 11k records, of which more than 8k are related to at least nine Pakistani banks. These cards were offered for sale in various cybercrime forums for prices of between $100 and $160 USD. "

During the event, participating cybersecurity specialists earned more than $300k USD for disclosing flaws that affected various smartphone models from several manufacturers. During the first day of the event Pwn2Own Tokyo 2018, the participants, experts on cybersecurity and digital forensics, hacked Apples [iPhone X](URL devices, Samsungs Galaxy S9 and Xiaomis Mi 6, generating revenues of more than $225k USD. The novelty of this edition of Pwn2Own was the implementation of a specific hacking session for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The second day, the organizers delivered rewards of $100k USD for one iPhone and two Xiaomi hacks. The day began with the triumph of the team Fluoroacetato composed by experts in information security and [digital forensics](URL Amat Cama and Richard Zhu, who hacked an iPhone X exploiting a Just-In-Time (JIT) vulnerability and an out of bonds flaw. Specialists received $50k USD for leaking device information, successfully extracting a previously deleted photo from the hacked device. In another test, the Fluoroacetate team failed in their attempt to demonstrate a base-band exploit directed against iPhone X devices in time, but the experts successfully exploited an overflow of integers in the web browsers JavaScript engine Xiaomi to leak an image stored in the phone, earning $25k USD. Researchers Georgi Geshev, Fabi Beterke and Rob Miller of the LaterMWR Labs team also failed in their attempt to hack an iPhone X in the browser category, as they were unable to use their exploit chain within the time the test allowed them. Later, this team hacked the Xiaomi Mi6 in the browser category using a download error along with a stealth app installation to load their custom application and leak the images of the device, thanks to this the team won $25k USD. The organizers reported the vulnerabilities found to the respective vendors, who paid a total of $325k USD for 18 zero-day vulnerabilities, of which $110k USD were paid for vulnerability reports on iPhone X. These security bugs could have been exploited by a persistent attacker or a surveillance company to compromise a device through the browser or Wi-Fi feature. This type of vulnerability can reach much higher prices in the cybercrime community. Overall, we grant a total of $325k USD during the two days of the event, buying 18 zero-day exploits. Manufacturers and developers received reports of these errors and now have 90 days to launch security patches to address these vulnerabilities. Once the updates are published, the user must remain attentive to their implementation, is mentioned on the official website of Pwn2Own Tokyo 2018."
4,cybercrime,u_webimprints09,US approves bill for creation of new cybersecurity agency,1,9zfwg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9zfwg6/us_approves_bill_for_creation_of_new/,2018-11-23 04:12:17," **The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act addresses the White House for President Trumps approval** A recently approved bill seeks to restructure the US [Department of Homeland Security](URL National Directorate of Protection and Programs (NPPD) to become a new cybersecurity agency. According to reports of specialists in digital forensics and information security, only the approval of President Trump is needed to make this concrete. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act, which was passed in the Senate in October and in the House of Representatives this week, essentially reconverts NPPD as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). According to specialists in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, CISA will be responsible for leading the programs to protect critical infrastructure and cyber security, develop associated policies and coordinate security matters with private sector and federal entities. The new agency will have a cyber security division, an infrastructure security division and an emergency communications division. Christopher Krebs, the current undersecretary of the NPPD, will lead CISA. The reorganization will optimize cybersecurity within DHS, while improving its ability to engage with government and some industry sectors, Krebs said in a statement this week. Giving the NPPD a name that reflects what it really does will help to better protect the nations critical infrastructure and cybernetic platforms, he added. This law arises in a context of growing threats to the critical infrastructure and the US industry by rival nations and increasingly sophisticated cybercriminals groups. The concerns of the American government have been increasing over the past few months. Geopolitical tensions between the US and countries like China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran have only exacerbated those concerns. However, the big question posed by experts in [digital forensics](URL is whether rearranging NPPD in a new agency really is a significant change in the interests of cybersecurity. Im concerned that the only name change does not elevate performance levels to what the nation needs, says Alan Paller, a specialist in information security issues. Paller points out that there has been some sort of internal battle between NPPD and the DHS Science and Technology Group, which is responsible for researching, developing, testing and evaluating technologies in support of the DHS mission. On the other hand, Colin Bastable, an expert in cybersecurity, says that the feds need a cybersecurity division for businesses, non-federal assets and consumers, in a similar way to the FBI. DHS will never address the problems that citizens and private companies face because of cybercrime because the main focus of DHS is the federal government, says Bastable. A federal cybersecurity office would focus on protecting Americans as consumers and employees, and the companies that employ them. It would be responsible for investigating and attacking the cyber criminal gangs and anticipating possible attacks. From the perspective of cybersecurity, DHS will always focus on federal infrastructure and critical systems, says Bastable. Despite how great the DHS structure is, it will never be enough to fight the cyber threats we face."

Larger companies even have their own digital forensic areas. The Government is a considerable working field for these professionals, an example of which is the FBI-owned Computer Analysis and Response Team (CART), which employs more than 500 digital forensic professionals. **Forensic Professional trajectory** Regularly the specialization of the digital forensics begins early. An example of career progression in a company or consultancy would be: * Digital forensics analyst junior * Digital forensics analyst senior * Digital forensics manager senior **Similar jobs** Other ways to refer to digital forensics experts include: * Computer crimes investigator * Forensics in computing * Specialist in digital crimes * Forensics analyst * Forensic computing technician **Salary of a digital forensics expert** According to a recent investigation, the average salary of a digital forensics is $77.2k USD. Overall, the annual salaries of digital forensics range from $55.7k USD to $119k USD. This includes the annual base salary, bonuses, commissions, overtime and other incomes. **Labor requirements** Usually newbies have a bachelors degree in computer science or engineering with a focus on cyber security, digital forensics or a related field. It is not enough to know about computer systems; cybercrime techniques must be understood as well. To increase your employment prospects, you can choose to seek specialized training in digital forensics. It may be possible to become a digital forensic expert without a bachelors degree, but it is complicated.

In the past, researchers monitored the activity of several markets used to deal with illegal content or tools used to carry out illicit activities. they focused on hacker communities in China and [Russia](URL discovering that members of the communities rarely mingle in clandestine forums, and they find different motivations. **Illegal market for Russian hacking** Contrary to popular belief, most Russian cybercrime communities are still accessible through the conventional network, with forums that configure servers on the Tor network as a backup in case of deletion and for users who navigate without VPN services. Administrators resort to other methods to keep their forums running, and the blockchain-based DNS is one of them. In closed forums (completely private communities) access is possible through the endorsement of an active member of the community. Infiltrators are expelled from the community quickly and exposed to avoid them. According to specialists in digital forensics, the forums where Russian cybercriminals meet are well organized and members are only interested in doing business; they carefully guard their resources and adopt a business strategy to make as much money as possible. Malicious programs, such as banking trojans, are sold in a similar way to products such as antivirus, a purchase is valid for a user license, researchers add. A common practice is that the malware author has full control of the source code. This not only guarantees the maximum monetization, but also protects the property against the creation of similar malware. The type of content and illegal services offered in these forums is the same as always, but adapted to the current demands: ransomware, trojans, exploits, spambots, are the type of developments most commonly found in these forums. **Chinese hacking forums** Chinese malware and illegal services vendors dont keep many similarities with their Russian counterparts. First, they do not enjoy the same level of access to tools and information because of the limitations that the Asian country has imposed on Internet browsing. Along with the language barrier, this leaves China in a certain way isolated, creating a local market for hackers with less skills. Access to more advanced tools is possible, but access to them requires jump  the great Chinese wall of the Internet, something that not any hacker gets. In China, hackers are mainly dedicated to offering VPN services, as the government maintains restrictions on navigation on the conventional web. One of the major differences between Russian and Chinese hackers is the fact that Chinese hackers encourage joint work. They help each other and share the source code of the tools they use, report specialists in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security. Both Russian and Chinese hackers share an appetite for illegal activity, but using different methods. The firsts ones are more interested in making money, while in China they worry more about transcending the barriers their government has imposed on the use of the Internet."
7,cybercrime,u_webimprints09,Tips to avoid computer fraud,1,9uqb0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9uqb0t/tips_to_avoid_computer_fraud/,2018-11-07 04:23:35," **Different ways to anticipate possible fraud scenarios** Several types of fraud are inevitable for most business; this is a reality that many organizations have refused to admit. The truth is those malicious actors, whether extern or members of the organization are always lurking around the critical systems of a company, and whenever they have the slightest chance to exploit any vulnerability or bypass security systems, they will do so. The various types of fraud persist, and frankly, it is not realistic to believe that companies can take measures that eradicate it definitively. But combating fraud does not have to be an unproductive task. Cybersecurity and digital forensics specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security bring you three useful tips to help companies fight fraud, specifically cyber fraud: **Think like a malicious actor** Antifraud systems may be effective, but they will not stop a criminal. The main challenge is to anticipate the opponents next move. To be able to get into an adversarys head, cybersecurity and digital forensics professionals should consider what motivates malicious hackers and what their goals might be in the organization. Threat actors are always looking for similar things: payment card data, personal identifying information, log in credentials, and other types of data and sensitive personal information. It is also necessary to consider the methods that scammers use to hinder existing controls to access an organizations systems. Two-factor authentication (2FA) can protect payment card data but what about other forms of electronic payment such as gift cards? Generally, this type of electronic assets does not have antifraud protection such as bank cards, which makes them an easy target for the cybercriminals. Research by specialists in [digital forensics](URL conclude that, in recent years, the number of illicit transactions related to electronic assets and gift cards has been increasing. Thinking like a fraud actor means considering all the options available to an attacker and admitting that certain systems or processes may have deficiencies. Identifying any weakness in existing antifraud programs can help companies to be better prepared for the worst of scenarios. **Monitor criminal forums in deep and dark web** Thinking like a criminal is just a part of the strategy. To anticipate a possible cyber fraud accurately, it is important to have an idea of the issues that are trendy among the [cybercrime](URL community. Not every organization considers this scenario, but it is important to have trusted people who are aware of todays deep and dark web. Some forums of deep and dark web focus on fraud, and in these forums, certain trends arise. For example, discussions related to the weak antifraud controls of online payment systems eventually manifested themselves empirically in more payment card frauds. The monitoring of deep and dark web can be one of the main sources of information on the new tactics and schemes of fraud used. But since access to these challenging and risky online communities, it is necessary for organizations to work with experts on the subject, avoiding security risks due to the nature of the information and the content that is handled in deep and dark web. **Determine possible links** Many experts in digital forensics have linked different types of fraud with certain geographic regions, forcing companies to make a great effort to better understand new schemes and tactics of fraud. This helps to establish causal relationships between the linguistic or cultural characteristics of a particular region with a certain type of specific fraud. But in recent years, new communities of cybercriminals have emerged rapidly in many more regions. Latin America is one of those examples. While scammers in Latin America were considered unsophisticated, disorganized, and unlikely to represent a real threat, these communities have evolved substantially. Many companies that previously had no reason to monitor the cybercriminals in this region of the world now strive to understand and combat the threats caused by scammers in Latin America. As threats and indicators can vary substantially in different regions and communities, monitoring these variations and new developments is a necessity for companies and anti-fraud teams."

Ethical hacking specialists report that the price of a unit of Bitcoin, the most widely known digital currency in the world, fell by more than $1.1k USD in a period of 24 hours, representing a decrease of 15%, reaching a minimum of $6.279k USD, its lowest level in two weeks. Despite the apparent seriousness of the matter, a sector of the cryptocurrency community remains optimistic, saying that the virtual currency goes well beyond Goldman Sachs decisions. Then the question is, if Goldman Sachs abandons the idea of exploring the option of a cryptocurrency desk, can that single variable collapse everything? commented Naeem Aslam, exchange market analyst. The reality is that the future of Bitcoin is already being negotiated in the main stock exchanges. However, the volume has been scarce since day one, Im not saying it hasnt improved, it certainly has. But if you compare the volume of the Bitcoin to other major products, only then can you see the difference; so for me its more important to watch this part of the equation, the analyst mentions. Investors must have one thing in mind. Banks have a common goal: to make money for their customers. So investment banks can play an old trick: create a panic in the market in order to trigger a major sales wave. A perfect set to buy something when the bad news spreads. And then, when the market gets a little stable, we get news that Goldman Sachs is back to business. Who could be the biggest beneficiary of that scenario? For various experts in the cryptocurrency market, there are other probable causes of the decline in the value of the Bitcoin. A recent investigation by ethical hacking specialists found that an online wallet linked to the black market containing 111 114 Bitcoin recently began moving its assets for the first time since 2014. Of the total Bitcoin units, nearly 11k Bitcoin moved to Bitfinex and 4.4k moved to Binance, indicating an attempt to sell these assets on the market. Allegedly, operations with these assets were sufficiently substantial to reduce the price of the Bitcoin. On the other hand, a sector of virtual asset market analysts attributes depreciation to a technical collapse, which seems to be the most probable cause. Either way, this depreciation was not caused by a single motive and, according to specialists in ethical hacking from the International Institute of Cyber Security it is likely that these types of assets continue to attract attention, either by the volatility in their values or by cybercrime events related to cryptocurrency holders and exchanges."

The operation findings, published in the report of an ethical hacking firm, found that between April 1 and June 30, 2018, the fraudulent activity carried out through mobile browsers and applications constituted 71% of overall cybercrime operations, representing a 16% increase over the same length of time as the previous year. The report also highlights the increase in fraudulent mobile apps, identifying 9.1k of these developments, which have become the most common vehicle for cybercrime, involving also the use of burner devices and fake accounts by the hackers. Specialists in ethical hacking estimate that fraudulent transactions made through false accounts and burner devices contributed 27% of the total value of the profits generated by these criminals. A burner device is the name given to a very low cost mobile phone that can be used temporarily until it is considered burned, which means it is too risky to use. These devices can be purchased with prepaid minutes and without any contract, allowing those who use them to easily hide their identity. This method of theft is particularly lucrative as seen in the report, indicating that, the value of a fraudulent operation ranges at an average of $335 USD. During this operation, the undercover unit also recovered nearly 5.1 million of payment cards and previews of compromised cards hosted on fraudulent websites and other sources, representing an increase of 60% of information in front of that from last year. The report also warns about variants of fraud that do not involve the intervention of more than one person (human-not-present fraud), highlighting how purchases on autonomous machines will lead to new authentication challenges for consumers, banking institutions and traders, who will have to change their security protocols to better manage emerging risks. Specialists in ethical hacking from the International Institute of Cyber Security consider in the same way that in the short term there will be an increase in the type of cybercrime that does not necessarily require the act of a hacker, and organizations must behave at the level of the challenge."

Paras Jha, (21 years old) from New Jersey, Josiah White, (20 years old) from Washington and Dalton Norman, (21 years old) from Louisiana, pleaded guilty in late December 2017 of multiple charges for their role in the creation and hijacking of hundreds of thousands of Internet of Things (IoT) devices to make them part of a notorious botnet known as Mirai. The Mirai malware performed scans for routers, cameras, digital video recorders and other unsecured IoT devices that used their default passwords (or had no password) and then made them part of a botnet. The three young men developed the Mirai botnet to attack the Minecraft video game servers, but after realizing that their invention was powerful enough to launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks in record time, they decided to publish Mirais source code. The publication of the source code generated more cyber attacks by several criminal gangs against websites and Internet infrastructure, one of which was the popular DNS provider Dyn, an incident that unused much of the Internet on the east coast in October 2016. After an investigation into the attacks of the botnet Mirai, the hackers were identified and sentenced in December 2017. Serving part of the sentence After US prosecutors recently announced that the three hackers had provided extensive and exceptional assistance in more than a dozen cases, a federal judge in Alaska sentenced each of the hackers to a five years parole, instead of going to prison. The trio was also sentenced to pay $127k USD in damage repair, comply with 2.5k hours of community service and voluntarily deliver significant cryptocurrency amounts derived from their illicit activities. According to recently filed judicial documents, Jha, White and Norman have been working with ethical hacking teams from government agencies for over a year, and will continue to cooperate. For example, prosecutors asked for the advice of the trio to disrupt the activities of the botnet Kelihos, a global network of more than 100k infected computers that were used to send spam, steal access passwords and infect other computers with ransomware and other types of malware. According to specialists in ethical hacking from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the three hackers also helped law enforcement agencies to stop the DoS attack based on Memcached, a tool that helped its operators launch attacks thousands of times more efficient than a common attack."

Then the hole is hidden with a metal plate. The thieves will then fish the card skimming device through the hole and connect it to the internal card reader using a magnet. &amp;#x200B; According to ethical hacking experts reports, robbers often perform this installation with an endoscope, a thin, flexible instrument used in medicine to give doctors a look within the human body. By connecting a USB endoscope to their smartphone, intruders can look inside the ATM to make sure their skimmer has been connected to the reader correctly. &amp;#x200B; The Secret Service says that once the skimmer is in place and the hole has been patched, thieves will often wait a day or so to place a camera. Thieves are believed to take this time to ensure that the drilling vibrations do not trigger an alarm from the non-slip ATM technology, mentions the security alert. When thieves are convinced that they have not activated any internal alarms when drilling and searching within the ATM, they return to finish the job by adapting a hidden camera inside the cashier. &amp;#x200B; It is difficult to cite all the Secret Service reports without giving the thieves a detailed plan on how to carry out these attacks. However, there is knowledge about several sources that spend a lot of time monitoring cybercrime and ethical hacking forums that have shared several documents with instructions, apparently providing details about how to execute these attacks. This type of knowledge circulates more fluently than ever in the cybercrime community. &amp;#x200B; Specialists in the topic consider that it is becoming increasingly difficult to detect skimming devices in ATMs, as many are designed to integrate within several components of the device. They also recommend that users focus on protecting their own physical integrity while at the ATM. If you visit an ATM that seems strange, altered or out of place, try to find another machine. Use only ATMs in public and well-lit areas, and avoid those in isolated locations. &amp;#x200B; The most important thing is to cover the cashiers keyboard with your hand when you enter your PIN, that way, even if the thieves get access to your card, there is less chance that they can also get your PIN. You would be surprised to find out how many people omit this basic precaution."

The FBI has collected reports indicating that hacker groups plan to carry out an ATM cash withdrawal scheme in the next few days, probably associated with a security breach against a card issuer, mentions a statement from the investigation agency. The FBI mentions that, in order to carry out the cash out operation, the attackers would compromise a financial institution with malware to access the banks client card information and exploit the access to the network, which would allow the ATM large scale theft. Organized cybercrime groups that coordinate attacks usually do so through phishing campaigns against banks to inject malware. Just before executing ATM withdrawals, intruders eliminate anti fraud security measures in the financial institution, such as maximum amounts of ATM withdrawals and any limit on the number of ATM transactions a user can perform in a single day. Attackers also alter account balances and security measures to make an unlimited amount of money available at the time of transactions, allowing a quickly cash out. Hackers often create fraudulent copies of legitimate cards by collecting data, warn FBI cyber security organization specialists. Later, other members of the criminal network withdraw funds from ATMs. Nearly all ATMs cash out operations are held on weekends. Last month, apparent cash out operations were disclosed, used to extract a total amount of $2.4M USD from Blacksburg National Bank accounts, made in two separate withdrawals from ATMs between May 2016 and January 2017. In both cases, the hackers managed to deceive a worker from the small bank based in Blacksburg, Virginia. From there, the attackers endangered the systems that the bank used to manage the credits and debits in the clients accounts. The FBI is urging banks to review their cyber security organization measures, such as implementing solid password requirements and two factor authentication using a physical or digital token when possible. According to reports of cyber security organization experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the FBI estimates that the attack would begin to be implemented in the coming days."
13,cybercrime,u_webimprints09,$1M USD per minute is lost due to cybercrime,1,9baxjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9baxjv/1m_usd_per_minute_is_lost_due_to_cybercrime/,2018-08-30 02:42:13,"More than 5K cases of publicly reported security incidents per minute are registered too Every 60 seconds $1.1M USD is lost because of cybercrime. This alarming figure has been calculated by cyber security organization specialists who compiled their own and third-source researches to analyze the malicious behavior of hackers. The resulting report, called Evil Internet Minute, bluntly describes the costs of cybercrime. Likewise, every minute there are 5518 records of cyber security organization incidents publicly disclosed. Around the world, when a large organization is affected by a cyberattack, the average cost is $11.7M USD per year and $222 per minute. All this despite the fact companies are spending about $171K per minute in system defenses. The investigation also concluded that an average of 1861 people are victims of online scams every minute, and on average 1.5 organizations are victims of ransomware attacks in the same time span (with an average cost for companies of $16K USD). In general, 2.7 million people are victims of cybercrime every 60 seconds. The report also states that phishing sites have lagged behind in the practice of cybercrime, as only one of these appears every five minutes. In addition, new sites running the CoinHive virtual currency mining script appear only once every 10 minutes. The vulnerable third-party code, which many organizations dont even know they are running, has become a central theme in recent cyber security organization events. Every minute, four potentially vulnerable web components are discovered, according to the research. This has different applications: for example, the Magecart group hacked third-party Javascript that allowed them to access hundreds of e-commerce sites at once and inject them with credit card skimming scripts. When users entered the details of their credit card to buy anything, they were sent directly to the attacking server, so there was no way for them to discover that they were being attacked, the cyber security organization experts in charge of the investigation claimed. User consciousness will always be a problem because hackers continually adjust their tactics to stay ahead and deploy their attacks; social engineering has been a problem since before the Internet existed, and it will remain a problem as long as we use any digital platform for our daily activities. For cyber security organization specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the most troubling part of the deployment of a cyberattack is that usually no one realizes at the time, so there is not much that users can do to protect themselves."
14,cybercrime,u_webimprints09,Data of 200 million Japanese for sale in a hacker forum,1,8mu6c2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/8mu6c2/data_of_200_million_japanese_for_sale_in_a_hacker/,2018-05-29 08:59:01,"A malicious actor was found operating outside of China, selling the data of approximately 200 million Japanese users in a clandestine cybercrime forum, according to a FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence report. According to [information security](URL experts, the data seems to have been gathered by hacking about 50 small Japanese sites and put up for sale as a large file in December 2017. After an analysis of a sample of data, professionals identified the hacked targets as small Japanese websites are activated in the retail, food and beverage, financial, entertainment and transportation sectors. FireEyes information security experts say the data is authentic, as it contains data about users whose personal information has been leaked in other infractions, but also contains data from new users. The mix of new and old data is confirmed by other clues that suggest that some data come from leaks that took place in 2016. The filtered data varies depending on the website from which they were stolen, but includes real names, email addresses, birth dates, phone numbers and private addresses, experts said. The price for the file is  1,000 CNY, about $ 150.96 USD. In the forum in which the hacker was selling the data, several actors commented that they bought the PII cache but did not receive the files. It is not clear if these comments are true. While the data sold does not contain very confidential information, the stolen information may facilitate identity theft, spam, malware propagation and fraud. Some inconsistencies remain about the origin of some of the data. The professionals managed to trace the online identity of the malicious actor to social network identification QQ, which is also linked to the online personality of another hacker. The QQ address is connected to a person in the Chinese province of Zhejiang, the researchers said. This person seems to have been active since 2013. FireEye [information security](URL professionals commented that the malicious actor has been linked to the sale of data in multiple forums: data from companies in other countries, such as China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand and countries of America."
