0,CVEs,linuxquestions,Docker (rootless) and overlayfs work-around? Stuck with vfs for now.,1,cod730,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/cod730/docker_rootless_and_overlayfs_workaround_stuck/,2019-08-10 13:59:34,"My distro will not merge [this patch](URL They claim it's an insecure option and with that in mind I will avoid compiling my own kernel just for this patch alone. Is there any other way I can bypass this [limitation](URL vfs is awful. I could use Buildah with fuse-overlay but it doesn't work with Docker. And moby/moby/issues makes me think it will take years before Docker supports something like that. So afaik my options, without going full bash script hell (e.g. find a way to make docker-compose use buildah) are: A) Stick with vfs B) Patch and compile the kernel with a possibly very insecure option (there were some concerning CVEs) C) ??? -------------- *I know about podman, but I have a hard dependency on `docker-compose` and I don't want to use root again (I have rootphobia, a very serious disease). It's non negotiable. Feel free to judge me for using experimental technology!*"
1,CVEs,linuxquestions,How secure is Linux on the desktop in comparison to Windows?,22,9eg7zi,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/9eg7zi/how_secure_is_linux_on_the_desktop_in_comparison/,2018-09-10 06:30:52,"To make it easier to compare: **Linux** * Ubuntu 18.04, same kernel as it ships, fully updated * X11 since Wayland is not ready * Firefox browser (I'm thinking about problems like is the sandbox as safe as Windows'? how are things isolated? etc) * Software installed only from the official repositories Windows * Windows 10 Enterprise 1803 fully updated * Max UAC level, regular user account with strong password * Firefox browser **Please ignore the following since I want to focus on security (like malware, privilege escalation, stealing personal data) and not the risk of random network calls, or privacy** * Telemetry * Candy crush in the start menu * Flatpak, Snaps, UWP. None of them are ready for prime time. * Vendor lock-in * Physical access to the machine. Disks are encrypted with VeraCrypt or the usual Linux encryption. I'm not sure I should use firejail or not, their CVEs got me a little scared. "
2,CVEs,linuxquestions,List of distros with (or without) an active CVE tracking list?,1,8ose0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/8ose0z/list_of_distros_with_or_without_an_active_cve/,2018-06-06 02:49:54,"I'm curious about which distros maintain, or at least discuss publicly, their status with respect to CVEs? I know that Red Hat has [a CVE Database](URL Debian has [CVE compatible advisories](URL and other big ditros provide something like this. I'm just wondering if there's a curated list of distros, whether they provide a list focused on their official repos, and if not then what they recommend users do. "

Seems like there are a lot of logged CVEs from Gnome and nearly none from XFCE, but this does not need to mean anything. Seems like there is a lot of development going on with Gnome, which appears to introduce some bugs and vulns. (e.g. the image thumbnail generator) "

Has it changed? I wonder what is the current state of: - publishing CVEs - mixing Mint and Ubuntu/Debian packages (for example mdm package) - security updates (can I install all updates by the GUI, especially kernel updates?)"

When I ran rpm -q --changelog | grep -i CVE , I don't see ANY 2015 CVEs installed. Was just made aware of this missing one by a security PCI audit our organization has every month. Any insight on what might be the issue? Thanks!"
