0,cyber-crime,nosleep,The Pond (Part 1),1,giy09b,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/giy09b/the_pond_part_1/,2020-05-13 22:24:26,"Two months ago, I shared a blog post concerning my wish and excitement to experience a complete isolation from anything related to modern civilization, inspired by Thoreau's experience near the Walden Pond in Massachusetts which was also the main subject of his famous philosophical book, Walden. I spent 30 days in a little village house near a similar pond, followed by another 30 days to reflect to my experience and revise the products of my thought by putting them into writing. The cabin that I've resided in was away from the pond by 15 minutes of walk, which the common people called ""The Pond"" (Glet in Turkish) without any distinctive name attached to it. The nearest village was 30 minutes away by walking, and all the wanderers with whom I'd came across with were either natives who were going hunting or workers who came from the eastern parts of Turkey in order to find labor jobs in the farms nearby. Every morning, except those which had harsh weather with heavy raining, I walked to the pond and meditated on a wooden platform resembling a tiny pier, which outstretched into the middle of the pond. This pier gave the experience to the person who walked on it a feeling of helplessness and surrender, to the heart and the mercy of the water. Living among the foundations of all the civilizations in the history, among the natural, directed my brain to the practice of critically considering the foundations of the world of abstracted thinking. All the complex construct of thought was diminished to it's core as soon as I got rid of the complex construct of men \* \* \* \* During my second day at the cabin, I laid down for an afternoon nap with the company of a musical held by a group of nightingales, refreshing the mind with each stroke of a shill note. When I opened my eyes to the setting rays of the sun, I saw a blond head peeking through my wide cabin window. We glanced at each other for a few seconds, then I realized it was probably more convenient to invite her in and offer her a cup of coffee and some fresh fruits. She told me her name, Yvette, and where she was from as I was peeling some apples for her. She told me that she was currently working in a space training program held by NASA. She came to the village as an assistant for a testing simulation which was aimed to educate Turkish students who're interested in that corresponding field. She told me that she went for a walk during her lunch time, causing her to stumble upon my shell. She displayed a rigid facial expression most of the time that we had spent together, either because of the strong taste of my coffee or because of my continuous effort of not telling her anything distinctive about myself. I could momentarily read her face like a book, but I couldn't tell what she was going to say five seconds later. She was hiding something, and constantly leaping back and forth between the idea of telling me whatever she was hiding or not. There was a scar on the right side of her neck, starting from a spot at the bottom of her ear all the way down to her clavicle. Her eyes were a stunningly beautiful blue, and her face was white with freckles scattered around. This gave a spicy taste into her glare. I asked her about some past experiences she might had with such space programs resembling the one she was working on right now, and she listed a long summary of her voluntary works on other training programs in the United States. As she was presenting her full CV inside a cabin located in the middle of nowhere, I got up to take out two chairs in front of the cabin to share a smoke with her. That's when I realized she was definitely hiding something about her story, and she didn't want me to exist anymore at all. I was probably the only person who witnessed her presence in this area. My eyes couldn't locate the pocket knife that I used to peel some apples with. I was sure I'd laid it down on the left side of the plate that we shared, and speculated the moment when she might have taken it. It had to be the instance when I turned around to get a couple of glasses from the top shelf for coffee. She was fast, now she had my knife. As far as I could tell, her secret agenda consisted of my dead body lying on the floor with no one else to find it, until she got off from whatever the trouble that she was in. I decided not to tip her off at all, and casually drew two cigarettes out of my packet. Offered her the one as I got the chairs out of the door. I ignited the lighter and we shared the fire. I was smoking with the devil. \* \* \* \* I didn't know how hard it would be to smoke a cigarette with an unsuspicious rhythm. My hands felt like they were betraying me. They were shaking in an abnormal way every time I brought the tip of the cigarette closer to my mouth. I felt the need to cover these unwanted shiverings by moving my whole body in a certain way when I knew shakings would happen, and justifying the movement of my body with exaggerated body language. I complemented this with constant talking of whatever my tensely working frontal-lobe was offering. This was probably the only moment I had in my life where I was trying so hard to maintain a good conversation with someone who clearly wished to get rid of my existence in the actual sense, and wishing to end this moment of terror as soon as possible. I've put thought into many paradoxes in the past, which challenged my brain in extremely strange ways. Though I never imagined myself getting trapped into one of them. Now I wish I'd spared more time for solving similar puzzles of that kind, then maybe I could figure out a way out of this never ending hell, all alone with the devil. I peeked at her cigarette, and then at mine. We were almost over. Fuck. I had no clue of what to do after the cigarettes were put off. If there was no occupation, then there would be no need for her to endure my annoying company. I had to think, find something better to do and buy myself a little more time. I could peel more apples? Fuck no. She had the knife, and as soon as I mentioned anything related to a knife, she would have to let the devil out. Maybe after 6PM some villagers would pass by, returning from their farms. Then I could scream, run, get help without me dying at the end of this scenario. Perhaps the constabulary patrol officers would pass by during their evening shift, who occasionally visit The Pond to kill some work time. They usually come between 6:30PM and 7:30PM, spend a significant amount of their evening patrol by drinking beer and smoking at the shore. Whatever way, I needed more time, that was for certain. I tried hard not to peek at my watch, but managed to do so by putting out my cigarette with my watch hand. I peeked as if I was looking at the ashtray. I had to compromise the occupation of the moment to find out exactly how deep I was, in shit. It was 5PM. Not so bad, I thought. I had one hour to entertain her like my life depended on it. I've never been a natural story teller or entertainer of any sort, though I practiced card magic and sleight of hand for three years during high school, and had several above-the-average stories that I could tell. Time was on my side, only thing left for me was making sure I could keep her in the moment. Even if there wouldn't be anyone passing by, there was still the probability of her deciding to spend the night in my cabin. Then I could escape while she was sleeping. At those fatal moments of survival I decided I would tell her a conspiracy theory that I ""believed in"", as for the real reason why people were dying to colonize Mars. I knew conspiracy theories would trigger her ""NASA employee ego"" and she would feel obliged to reply my ignorance with sorts of sentences starting in the fashion of ""well, actually, the fact is..."" and so on. This way, I could keep her in the conversation and wouldn't have to drag the burden of talking all alone. I began to execute this plan. But in the middle of my speech, her face gave me the impression that she was not triggered or impressed by whatever I was telling her about at all. It didn't work. It had no effect on her. Just as I was blaming myself for putting all the people of an organization into a stupid stereotype that didn't have any logical grounds, the idea strike me. Of course, she didn't work for NASA. She didn't know shit about NASA. That must have been the reason why she was not into whatever I was telling her about. My plan was falling apart, even though I was so proud of the mechanics of it. There remained only one reality for me, only one natural law, only one definition of truth: If I lose her attention, I die. I decided I would stop utilizing smart strategies and directly dive into an interesting story of mine while keeping a friendly attitude towards her. I wouldn't want her to experience me telling a story about some crazy shit while shivering. This had to be natural, friendly, just like how my posture and attitude was before the apples were involved. Fucking apples. I started talking about a dangerous time when me and my friends executed a computer hack in a government building and compromised over a hundred computers, while there was a cyber security conference being held at the same time with thousands of participants. We basically gained remote-shell access on multiple computers by sending our malware through a vulnerable network that we had established in the building, and over a hundred of these ""cyber security experts"" jumped into our net. You can't blame them, no one expects to get his computer owned in a highly secured government facility. That was how good we were. As I elaborated on the details of this story, she seemed to be enjoying every little aspect of it. Well, this wasn't a news flash for me, and it shouldn't be for you either. She obviously was a criminal, and enjoyed stories that involved high criminal activity. The interest that she showed towards my exceptional story allowed me to get some relaxation. She took the charge, and started to talk about a small scaled hack that she herself was a part of during her teenage years. She was telling her story in such an enthusiastic manner that I didn't need to participate in the conversation for minutes. This gave me a brief period to reflect on what to do next, and definitely what not to do. When I looked at her eyes, I felt friendliness for a few seconds. I forgot all the threat she was posing against me. We spent twenty minutes talking about the same subject. My relaxation and cosiness levels were above the safe spot, which I should definitely not feel like. Not at that moment. I was aware of the dilemma that I was in yet I couldn't help the enjoyment of the moment that was on the air. She dragged her chair closer to mine, and widened her eyes with an innocent smile on her face, while kept talking. I'll just go ahead and admit it. I was fucking enjoying it. The mixture of pure terror and pure attraction along with the fact that I had such a limited time, took me to a never-experienced-place before. Pure ecstatic feelings that I never wanted to get out of me. This realization of mine, that I would probably never experience a feeling of this kind at this level even if I arranged all the required elements and pulled it off with a conscious effort, made me accept the fact that following attempts of blossoming a feeling of this sort would never resemble anything like how it was the first time. Ask any drug user this simple fact, and they would all agree, given that the hormones are the biological drugs of one's body. I could tell she showed a sort of affection towards me. This was not a one way feeling. The moment felt like we were dancing at the edge of a cliff in a misty weather. Any mistaken act that would emerge from either party would bring everything into darkness. We were trying to widen the line where danger and love meet, but there was a constant reminder of the remained time. It was like a sort of drum roll getting tenser and tenser. I dragged my chair a little closer to hers as a way of complementing her approach. I was out of my limits. Our knees touched each other following my movement and we both froze looking at each other's eyes. Did I lose the words, or did she take them away? Her cheeks got the color of a light pink in the heat of the moment, both metaphorically and literally. It was a hot day. We didn't know how to react. A sound from a wireless transceiver broke into our strange atmosphere as a helper to remind us of exactly what to, of our real places and our real motives. ""crrtch. Mr. Philips speaking. Where the fuck are you, Yvette? You should have been at the meeting spot by now. HURRY. THE. FUCK. UP. crrtch"" \* \* \* \* It's cool. It's cool. It's cool. I believe I can turn this situation around. What if we ignored the irritating voice that just came from her transceiver? Would that be too weird? I could keep playing along and disregard the fact that she had such a device on her possession. But I suspect whether if she would join me. Should I turn my head around and look at her already? Is she looking at me right now? Is she holding the knife? I'll slightly turn my head around as to acknowledge the transceiver sound. But I also want to convey the message that if she held the knife out of fear or out of reflex, she should immediately take it away. I wanted her to know I was completely okay with anything. Anything that would keep her from harming me. Would she get it? Would she accept it? My options were very limited. If I'd looked at her and saw the knife in her hand, then it was over. I couldn't risk it. This was the most reasonable thing to do. The best I could do to save us. I just needed to slightly shift my view, and everything would be back to light pink cheeks and criminal stories. I slowly looked at the trees that were on the right side in my view. She was staring at me. But I couldn't tell exactly what emotion she was displaying. Anger, fear, sadness, pity... Hell, it might had even been happiness. I stared at the trees for a few more seconds. Still, nothing was happening. I felt the urge to say something, as I suspected she might have an expectation of my interference, perhaps she wanted me to play the stupid and verbalize that fact. ""Did that voice came from the village?"" I proposed, and hoped that she would just appreciate my effort and let go of the tension she held. Perhaps she would agree the way out I was offering to her. She said nothing. I could still feel the burn of her spicy stare on my face. I was literally begging and swearing to her in my mind. Just fucking accept the way out. Don't do it. Take the fucking easy way, so we can both breathe when the day ends. I heard her chair squeaking. She was on the move, standing. Or worse, getting something out of her pocket. The knife. She was pulling out the knife. Fucking apples. I couldn't wait much longer. She showed me the green light. Rather, made me hear the green light. The best moment for me to play my role in her game, was this moment. The talk was over. Now it was the phase of acting. Before she could make any move I had to take the ropes in my hands. I had never fought anyone before. I was never a fighter. I always ran away from fights or talked my way out of them. The talking was over now, was I supposed to run? Would that be my best option? Shit, I only wanted to live. If I were to die, I didn't want to die in the woods. I didn't want to die from her hands. Surely I didn't want to die before getting to know her more. I prompted again, ""Can you make an exception?"". I felt her hesitation to reply, the uncertainty she was going through. She didn't say anything for a few seconds. She actually considered my offer. Then she broke the thick silence with a pitiful voice, ""I can. But my employer can't"". I needed to gather the guts to look at her face before anything, then I would decide what to do next. I turned my head, gazing directly into her eyes. The moment our eyes met, she kicked my chair by the cradle, toppled me over to the ground. My head hit the wooden parquet with the momentum of the fall. I laid on the ground. I could barely see her with my eyes half open as she pulled out her transceiver and started talking to someone. I could make out the word ""Jacques"" from the conversation, but I wasn't sure if I was hearing correct or not, and I didn't give that much of a crap to be honest. I saw no emotion in her face. The devil was finally out. I felt dizziness and heavy pain in my head. My heart felt as if it was trying to get out of my chest. I knew my arms and my legs would instantly shake in a crazy way if I slightly moved them in any direction. They were in betrayal again. I could only see two options for me. Two routes to take. Then a final choice. First choice was dying right there, right at the spot where I was lying. Second, putting a fight for the first time in my life, then dying. In most cases I would choose the easy route and die directly. Though I don't know if it were for my survival instincts or a sort of momentary courage, I decided to choose the second route. I decided to see where that path leads me. As she was speaking to Jacques, I slowly sneaked myself back with the help of my left arm. It was shaking like a bitch, but I managed to get myself through the cabin door before she realized it. I shut the door with a firm kick. Without getting up, I burst forward and locked the door. She must've heard all these events as there were no speaking sounds anymore. Pure silence. It was happening. I was going to die. Nothing mattered anymore. And nothing was going to matter after I die. I had only few seconds to find a solution, before she cracked open the door. I knew I needed a weapon of some sort. I started to inspect the surrounding objects. But due to the tension of the moment, I was shifting the focus of my sight too fast and couldn't see anything properly, let alone deciding on anything as a viable tool for a fight. On the left corner was my bed with a couple of pillows on it. In front of the window was my desk. On it, there must've been two or three pens, but I didn't have the skill to use such small objects as deadly weapons. I probably couldn't even use my pocket knife if I had it in my hands right now. No. I needed something big, heavy. Something that would minimize the probability of failure when swung towards a body. As I was struggling with the process of choosing an appropriate tool for my defense, I saw one of the chairs fly through the cabin window, landing on my bed with scattered pieces of glasses hitting everywhere. I couldn't think anymore. I didn't have the luxury to think anymore. I felt like a cattle waiting for his inevitable slaughter while in the occupation of witnessing the slaughter around. I reached to the right corner of the room and picked up a big wooden plate that I used as a replacement for one of the entrance steps of the cabin. I stood up and positioned myself on the right side of the window. My legs were shaking. I expected her entrance through the window. The door slammed open and hit my right shoulder in a great strength instead. The wooden plate dropped from my hands while I simultaneously fell on it. My weapon landed right beneath me, which felt stressing. I saw her silhouette as she stood on the threshold of the broken door. Sunlight was trying to pass by her and reach me around her body. She took three steps and lowered her body to look at her victim's face before the execution. Her fascinating eyes were as beautiful as they were the first time I saw them. Only now, they had some red marks of sadness. They were shining more than they were before. There was no enjoyment for her, I could tell. My right hand resided under my head, and under my right hand resided the surface of the wooden plate. I knew my only chance. I lifted my head, and turned my face towards her's. Her lips were twitching. I felt like I was going to cry. I wanted to kiss her so badly. I got a grip of the corner of the wooden plate and swung it right onto the left side of her head. Without thinking anything and without looking behind, I ran. I routed myself on the pathway to The Pond through the woods. I was running as fast as I can. I had no idea whether she was right behind me or still lying passed out in the cabin, or better yet dead. The only occupation of mine was to appreciate the blowing wind on my much heated head and not tripping over by a bush or by a rock. I passed countless trees. The road seemed like it was never going to end. Then I realized, running to the The Pond was the most illogical thing to do. I was literally dragging myself into a cage of water in a great amount of speed. I could've taken the road up to the village and easily get myself help after 10 minutes of running. Why on earth would anyone take the road to The Pond while running away from a predator? It was not right. But that was not a right moment. Acting comes before thinking in a moment of survival. After a hell of a run, I felt great deal of tension under my left foot. With a quick peek I saw that my left slipper was not where it was supposed to be. It must've fell off the moment when I got up from the floor at the cabin. Or most likely while I was running like a beheaded turkey. Either way, my foot was in a pretty bad shape because of the prickly bushes and sharp rocks. The interesting thing was, I felt no pain. Nothing, other than a feeling of tension under my foot. Yvette took away my logic, my affection, and now she finally took away my nervous system. I felt like a sack of meat and bones without anything special about it, dragging himself into unnecessary struggles and not just accepting its inevitable death. The Pond's shore shined through the trees. I stopped and took several breaths. I heard the hurling sound of her running just a couple of minutes behind me. I passed the trees and rushed myself down from the hill. I didn't care about the bumps, the rocks, the thorn-bushes, or the fact that my right slipper just fell off too. Barefoot I got myself on the shore. Now that I had a little time to stay still, the pain from the back of my head, from my right arm and from my feet began to torture me. Tears of pain fell down through my eyes. I had no chance in fighting with her at the road if I went for a run to the village. I had nowhere to escape. I didn't know how to swim either. Desperately, I looked over to The Pond, and a glimmering of light shining from the pier caught my eye. I heard the sound of her presence approaching, she was just behind the hill. I sprinted over to the pier. The wooden blocks were still hot because of the midday burning sun, even though the sun was setting now. I located the shining object which turned out to be a thin iron rod that fishermen use in order to wrap their strings around. It had a sharp tip and seemed like a convenient tool to use if one wished to pierce a flesh of meat with it. I flattened my left arm down, and held the tip of the iron rod between my pointing and middle fingers. The rod stretched upwards behind my stretched arm, giving me the opportunity to keep it hidden from a front-facing angle. I saw the blond jump over the hill, and run down from the shore. She stopped at the entrance of the pier. She turned straight towards me. No words were spoken. No motion took place. It was as primitive as a moment could get. Our personas were left behind at the cabin. Now there were two creatures with mere instincts, facing towards each other. The stillness of her body broke as she guided her hand into her pocket. She pulled out my pocket knife. She drew the steel out of the wooden handle and began to take small steps along the pier. As she got closer, I saw that the left side of her face was covered with purple bruises and blood. Her left eye was closed. Redness came out of her nose and her left ear. She took another step. With her last window opening to earth, her beautiful blue eye, she was staring at my feet. I followed her and saw that my feet were covered with redness too. We lifted our sights at the same time. We gazed upon each other's eyes. She took another step. I had a feeling. Sort of a relief, now that I knew in either way out of this fight the great pain that tortured me both physically and mentally would finally be over. I was ready to give myself fully to whatever life had in place for me. She must've felt the same way. I saw a face of a tired woman. She took another step. I couldn't hold back my tears and I didn't care what she would think anymore. I let drops of tears slide down from my cheeks. I tightened my grip on the iron rod. I saw her only eye was shining even more brighter than before. I witnessed the flow of tears through her bruised face. I hardly stood still. My balance and core strength were giving away, melting by the tears of the blue eye. How could I hurt a person, when the only thing I wanted was to wrap my arms around her? She took another step. There were very little distance left between us. We were two sponges. We were squeezing out the last drop of life inside of us. I cried, ""You don't have to"". She took another step. She sobbed, ""I don't want to"". She took another step. I knew the time had come. The time of me, and of her. She took another step. I moved the tip of the iron rod from between my fingers, to between my palm and my thumb. She took another step. I saw her grip getting tightened, and her arm slowly moving back for a last strong swing. She took another step. I widened the gap between my thumb and my palm. The rod slid down until the other end of it was in my grip. She moved her knife hand back until a point that would provide a strong swing. I drew my hand to the side, closed my eyes, and pushed front with the last drop of strength that I had left. The rod pierced half way through her belly. I felt like an iceberg. I opened my eyes. I shared the shocked feeling pouring down through her eye. I took a step back. The knife she stabbed into the left side of my abdomen slid out. She shared the shocked feeling pouring down through my eyes. We dropped down on our knees, fell on the ground side by side. We were facing to each other. I searched for her hand with mine without lifting my head. I held it tightly. I pulled myself closer to her. The tears wouldn't stop. She moved her head closer. As we were about to share a last experience of affection, her head tilted slightly downwards. The color of her eye was gone. And then, everything went to darkness. \* \* \* \* ""Dispatch from node in three, two, one..."", said the man in the black suit. Kayra took out the memory-interface goggles and looked at the ceiling. The white parts of his eyes were bloody due to extensive hours of memory-screening. His hair had a weird look because he didn't take off the goggles for straight 5 hours, and his nose bridge had marks of red lines on both sides. He felt like he could use a cup of coffee, but he had an empty stomach, so he let go of the idea. He checked his new parter, Bora, with a fast peek. It seemed like that guy was not going to get used to this in any time soon. Bora was looking straight to the wall in front of him, withouot blinking. Even though he viewed many crime scenes at the academy, they were not even close to the ones in real world investigations. There were love, anger, betreyal, passion, agony, pain, and fear; which stimulated unique regions of the brain in the moment. Those replicas at the academy, on the other hand, were just virtual memories created by mostly game designers. You could still view the virtual memory like it was a real one, but you couldn't activate the right parts of the brain to invoke the correct feelings. This was a huge risk for the officers of the Memory Screening and Investigating Division (MSID), as you couldn't know what kinds of messed up crap you could encounter in a dead man's brain. But it was a risk that they were willing to take. The screening practice made their job lot easier by giving the officers access to the victim's memories, hard-coded as unique connections of neurons. The last memories of the victim that MSID was interested in mostly resided in the frontal lobe of the brain. They had until 48 hours to extract the neural patterns of the victim's memories before the neuron cells were de-naturised. Bora, having seen hundreds of virtual memories at the academy, was still trying to recalibrate his feelings after this screening, which was his second one since academy. Kayra lowered his head and looked down at the table. He grabbed his goggles, and rotated them in his hands. At the left side, the goggles had a departmental mark, ""Turkey Directorate General of Security - MSID Division"". The right side said ""Property of Leonardo"". ""Anyway"", he said, ""let's get this shit over with."" \* \* \* \* To be continued..."
1,cyber-crime,nosleep,How has no one been reporting this?,1,gpxb69,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gpxb69/how_has_no_one_been_reporting_this/,2020-05-25 07:00:17," [URL I just this news report and I am amazed I haven't see any mention of it anywhere: ""Inspector John Carlos (pseudonym) of the Narcotics Department of the Juarez, MX police department has come forth with information regarding a number of kidnappings in the border regions of Mexico. John has concrete evidence that Drug Cartels involved in Occult activities are behind the disappearances. When John Carlos reached out to the Weekly Day field office in Mexico City he was immediately flown to a secure location and given a full security detail. The shaken inspector stoically described the scenes at the La Trgono Cartel facility that prompted his disclosure thus: \[Translated from Spanish\]: We arrived on the scene at 1100 hours on a Thursday afternoon. Until now we had been investigating the situation as we would any other Cartel crime. I hate to sound crass but kidnappings are routine in these areas under the current political, economic, and social climate. When we breached the perimeter of the facility we were not prepared for what we found. As John Carlos testified, this region of Mexico was known for its Cartel activity; the usual drug trafficking and inter-Cartel warfare related to territory, trafficking lanes, and money. Aside from these activities Cartels have been known to kidnap and ransom high-value targets to fund their operations. The initial difference that prompted the Juarez PD to involved the Centro Nacional de Inteligencia (CNI) was the nature of the victims. Taken from the streets these children were not the usual high-value target that cartels have been known to deal with. When working with the CNIs cyber-crime division it became apparent that these children were being auctioned off on dark-web marketplaces in exchange for bitcoin and other crypto-currency. These patterns were not normal and working together the agencies were able to pinpoint one facility were this Cartel was operating from. John Carlos continued: We expected to find the usual decrepit temporary operations center that Cartels will use briefly and then abandon. Instead what we found was a pristine room measuring fifty feet by fifty feet. The floor was inlaid with a triangular tesselation that was physically difficult to look at; the shapes seemingly impossible to make sense of. At the center was a stainless steel operating table. Though this was a modern, medical appliance the situation implied was not medical or contemporary. Surrounding the table was a series of two-meter tall poles topped by triangular candles whos wax emitted a soft blueish-purple light. Though the candles were like nothing I have experienced, the wick and flame seemed to be standard fare. On the table sat a laptop computer displaying an internet-connected video stream from an unknown location. I hesitate to describe what we saw on that screen in great detail but suffice it to say we discovered what happened to a number of the children. We were unable to get John Carlos to comment further on what he witnessed on the video feed but given his demeanor we did not press him further. Inspector Carlos put us in contact with the forensic laboratory that processed the evidence found at the scene and we were able to speak with Sub-Officer Maria Salazar. The candles that were brought in for analysis were very unusual to say the least. The wax seemed to be mixed with a bioluminescent organism found only in the deepest areas of the ocean. We are quite lucky we are so closely connected to the University of Veracruz who have a phenomenal Marine Biology department or this may not have ever been discovered. Lieutenant Salazar went on to say she did not wish to sensationalize any of her findings but she reiterated how abnormal and seemingly impossible these findings were. The CIA/FBI is in talks with the CNI to see if there is any link between the ongoing investigation into the La Trgono Cartel and recent unexplained phenomena as far north as Los Angeles, California. We here at the Weekly Day are here for you as always and will report as the story unfolds."""
2,cyber-crime,nosleep,I'm So Sorry I Forgot to Lock the Car...,13,d5adid,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/d5adid/im_so_sorry_i_forgot_to_lock_the_car/,2019-09-17 11:58:18,"It was late as I stood in the kitchen, sipping my tea and yawning. The wife was away taking the kids to visit her mother. I'd elected to stay behind owing the difference of opinion we held. Namely, that I was good enough for her daughter. Well, I'm 52 and we've been married for 16 years, so it's doubtful that's ever going to change. &amp;#x200B; I took another sip of my tea. Our kitchen window faced out into the street. The house is on a slant at the top of the street, meaning it has a slightly elevated view. I stared out into the night. Across the street sat a dark green Volvo S40, my pride and joy. &amp;#x200B; I finished my tea and went back to my book. 2 hours later found me back in the kitchen, sleep evading me. As I gazed once again, out of the window towards my car. I thought I caught a some movement from within it. I felt a chill pass through my stomach and I gripped the handle of my mug tighter, squinting at it. After a few seconds I determined it had merely been a trick of the light. I swilled out my Eighth Doctor mug and went to turn off the light, when doubt gripped me. &amp;#x200B; Had I locked the car? &amp;#x200B; Of course I had! I thought crossly to myself. Still, uncertainty clawed at me. With a sigh of irritation I went and fetched my keys, pointed them out of the kitchen window and pressed the electric fob. The car's indicator lights flashed in response. &amp;#x200B; There. If it hadn't been locked before, it was now. &amp;#x200B; What was that? I swore that as the lights flashed for the second time, it caught something and that the car shook almost imperceptibly. I shook my head. Clearly, I was allowing my over-active imagination to get the better of me. That'll teach me for reading crime novels in the dark. &amp;#x200B; I was about to call it a night when another thought struck me. Davin told me only the other week about how a fox had got into his Audi and shit all over it, bloody thing bit the RSPCA lass who came to retrieve it. Dav still hadn't been able to get the smell out. &amp;#x200B; So, with images of vulpine excrement all over the insides of my car, I decided to go and make absolutely certain that there was nothing amiss with it. I pointed my fob back out of the window and pressed it again. Car unlocked, I made my way out through the sitting room and entrance hall. I unlocked my front door and padded over the road in my slippers. &amp;#x200B; The streetlight while ample, was insufficient to see the inside of the car, partly because of the light reflections on the windows. I cautiously opened the door and the interior lights came on. I tentatively stuck my head inside. &amp;#x200B; Nothing. &amp;#x200B; All was fine and it should be. &amp;#x200B; I was just about to close the door and curse myself for a fool, when I caught a whiff of something awful. I checked under the seats and couldn't find anything. The only place left to look was the boot. I closed the car door and went around to the back of the car, unlatching the lid. Flinging up the lid I was able to take in a strange pile of rags illuminated by streetlight, from which the fetid smell was obviously emanating from. &amp;#x200B; My boot had been empty earlier. &amp;#x200B; The rags moved, quicker than I could blink. I had just enough time to get a flash of long, yellow nails. Light catching grinning teeth filed to points. Next I knew, there was a flurry sudden movement, I was grasped and yanked inside. I felt a weight roll over me and then I was the one in the boot, with the lid being slammed shut. I screamed and thrashed about in darkness, but to no avail. &amp;#x200B; My car started. He - it - must of found them where I dropped them on the ground. My tail lights flared on and I felt my car backed out of its space as I was driven away. I don't know if it was the shock or what, but I think I passed out. &amp;#x200B; Coming to, I was momentarily disoriented. Realisation dawned with hideous clarity. My phone! Oh thank god, help would soon be on the way! I fumbled around a bit and with more bending than a man of 52 is generally capable of, I managed to ferk the phone out of where I was lying on it; in my dressing gown pocket. &amp;#x200B; It took me a moment after its light illuminated my face, to remember how to unlock the blasted thing. Bloody smart phones. I frantically keyed in 999 and hit call. Nothing. I checked the screen to make sure I hadn't made a mistake. There was no mistake. No signal. &amp;#x200B; My stomach dropped, I didn't understand. You're supposed to always be able to reach the emergency services, or so I'd always thought. &amp;#x200B; The car stopped. &amp;#x200B; I dared hope for a second that perhaps my deranged captor had been pulled over by the police? But no, my car hadn't so much as been reported stolen. After all, why would it? Maybe it was going to let me go or else, abandon the car? Both of these scenarios seemed unlikely. &amp;#x200B; More fear flashed through me. Perhaps this was when he killed me? A moment's relief when I realised the ignition hadn't been turned off. I felt the car begin to very slowly move again. There was a violent jolt and I was thrown against the metal plating that covers the back of the passenger seats. There was a sudden impact and a loud noise muffled by my being inside of the boot. &amp;#x200B; A sensation of sinking struck me and a horrible thought popped into my head. I think I'm in water. There are burbling noises and I don't have much time. I'm typing this all into my phone as fast as I can and I pray to god it survives so that my family knows what happened to me. &amp;#x200B; My name is Nigel Carver, please tell my wife Maggie and our kids that I love them very much and that I'm sorry. I'm so sorry I forgot to lock the car... &amp;#x200B; \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *The preceding was a transcript from a data file recovered by our Cyber Forensics Specialists from a mobile phone found inside the boot of a submerged vehicle, along with a body identified as one Mr Nigel Carver, the owner of said vehicle.* &amp;#x200B; *The car was recovered from the bottom of a nearby reservoir.

3,cyber-crime,nosleep,Someone who stole my stories turned out to be stalking me.,1,cqiayx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cqiayx/someone_who_stole_my_stories_turned_out_to_be/,2019-08-15 10:14:49,"No one likes the feeling of sitting down, trying to put together the scattered pieces of an idea in your head and working for hours to bring it to life; only to watch some lazy worm slip in and takes advantage of your hard work for their gain. &amp;#x200B; This has happened to me before and each time it feels terrible, I see this happen in all walks of media. It especially happens to smaller creators, people who feel like they don't have a way to fight back. While I have fallen victim to this before, it never got much further than me contacting the individual to sort it out. The last time it happened though, things went way further than I could have expected when I first saw I had gotten a message on Reddit. &amp;#x200B; Hi, AuthorJoJo. It opened. I found some stories you had written on your Facebook page and narrated a few. Let me know what you think? When I read this I felt a little confused and clicked the user profile to see if we had any other previous interactions. The profile was about as new as you could get. Withing the message was a link to a youtube channel. While it was admittedly a little irritating I didn't want to give the person a hard time, a lot of people just don't understand the proper etiquette. Something I would be perfectly fine to educate the person on. Before I went to respond and inform the guy how getting permission typically works I figured I would check out the video. I like helping other creators and if we could settle things without anyone getting aggressive I didn't mind giving him pointers on his videos as well. So I clicked over to his channel and got mildly discouraged. His channel Rain in the port had dozens of videos, a lot of them were pretty nonsensical. Various songs and footage of seemingly just darkness. Mixed among those videos though was at least ten of my stories narrated in full. I could understand if he just threw a story up and thought it would be okay as long as he contacted me after, some of the videos were weeks old though. Trying to keep a cool head I clicked on the first video he did on one of my stories, it only had a handful of views at the time. I sat alone in my room listening to the out of breath man peaking his mic every five seconds. Wondering if it was even worth trying to talk to him. I couldn't tell if he had tried to put a white noise track of rainfall or if a fan was just pelting the mic but it sounded awful. As I considered my next course of action I heard something off in the story that made me sit up in my chair. Moving the cursor around I brought the story back a few seconds to make sure I wasn't just hearing things. In the story Times at VyMont high. A woman recounts the time she and a group of friends explored her highschool after dark. The story was the same in his narration of it except for one unnerving detail. He had changed the name of the high school. He had changed it to the high school that I went too. I listened over and over to it, in disbelief. It was one thing to take something I worked hard on without asking. It was enough that he altered the story of his own accord but do change it to something so personal? I had never needed to take an aggressive stance before when it came to plagiarism but it was looking like things were heading that way. Out of curiosity, I decided to click on the description box to see if at the very least he had credited me and he had, just- It was just my Reddit username over and over. AuthorJoJo AuthorJoJo AuthorJoJo. It went on and on for what felt like ever until the letters started to blend together and lose all meaning. Already disturbed I decided to dive deeper and clicked on another video. A story called Don't look dilemma. A story about a man's inability to look left or right despite all the noise he keeps hearing around him. While I was listening to Rain in the Port poorly read my story with heavy and soggy breaths every sentence, I began replying to him on Reddit. Informing him that it's not okay to steal someone's content, that there are laws in place to protect people like me and that I didn't appreciate how he altered my story. I then concluded by saying if he could take the videos he had done already down, I would be open to discussing with him more. As I was typing all this the part in the story where the main character gets to his house after having to drive without looking left or right came up. When the narrator read over that part I couldn't help but notice his addition to the story. I couldn't help but watch my expression drop in the reflection on my screen. The string of numbers was my address, the house I was sitting in while listening to him read my story. I switched my tab back to youtube and saw that the picture accompanying the story was a screenshot of my house on google maps. Having someone steal your work always feels like you were violated but this, this was too much. All the sudden instead of just not feeling safe to post my stories online, I didn't feel safe in my own home. Sitting back in my chair I turned my head towards the large open window that led out to the backyard. Slowly I reached over and grasped the blinds to pull them across the window, I just couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. Already on Reddit still, I messaged a close author friend and asked her what to do, how I could take down the guys channel or something. I had never needed to issue strikes or anything like that so I was unsure how to go about it. I was waiting on her to respond and for Rain in the Port to get back too me. I was still holding onto hope that it was some kind of mix up or maybe a prank one of my friends was pulling, although none of my friends sounded like this man. I went back to his page and shifted through videos, even the ones where he is just walking around in the grass, my username is plastered all over the description and the comments. My nerves were acting up enough to clamp my teeth around my fingernails. It was isolating. My art and my safety had been taken.A few of his videos had the titles of my stories but were absent of audio, judging by the length of those it looked like he had read the story but there was no recording of it. Like he just recorded the darkness while he read the story in his head or something. Then I noticed that at the end of every video he would play snippets of the song The cat came back by Harry S. Miller. That song played over and over as I searched through his stories looking for and finding the changes he made. Character's names would be altered to the name of someone close to me or environments would match places I'd go. Some of the characters were even described to dress in clothing I owned or own things I had bought right around the time of the videos release date. My body nearly flew out of the chair when the notification rang out of my speakers indicating I had a new message on Reddit. With my hand resting on my chest feeling my heart beating against my ribcage, I switched back to Reddit. To my relief, Natalie had gotten back to me before the narrator did. She expressed concern and advised me to first head over to a board that had the resources and information I needed to get through to youtube. I thank her and she said to let me know if things escalate. I didn't want to worry her by telling her the guy knew such intimate details about me. Could I have gone to the cops? What would they do? Instead, I headed over to the Reddit she linked me and sifted through the various post there that dealt with copyright infringement and how to approach it. Even going so far as to contact some of the more active members. After receiving a wave of support I went through the steps I was told to and put a strike on any video I could. Even if it didn't stop the channel owner it would at least make sure no one stumbled across the videos and learned all that stuff about me. Since he still hadn't gotten back to me all I could do was sit there, refreshing his channel repeatedly. Hours could have passed with only the rhythmic click of my mouse to keep me company, I couldn't for the sake of my sanity listen to any more of my stories be twisted around. The noise of my mouse perfectly echoed the sound of another Reddit notification. If it weren't for the new video that was posted upon refreshing the page I would've thought it was someone from the board looking for an update. That wasn't the case though, I knew it was Rain in the Port messaging me to let me know a new video had been posted. This one wasn't a story I wrote but it was my story. I listened in ever-increasing dread as Rain in the Port echoed in precise detail everything I did that day. I stared, eyes locked on the screen in horror as a loop of me closing my blinds just a few hours ago played in the video. The rest of the night, I couldn't budge. I managed to call the police but they said other than having a car patrol my house there wasn't much they could do. They found no one on the property and unless a crime was committed cyber police wouldn't get involved. I was on my own. Eventually, with the reassurance of red and blue lights periodically coloring the inside of my room, I was able to fall asleep. Come morning I was slightly relieved to see that no only had his channel and Reddit account disappeared but I had a plethora of support hiding in my inbox. It almost made me feel safe having somewhere to turn to. Unfortunately, I would never feel safe in that house again, it wasn't long before the sleepless nights convinced me to move. With a heavy heart, I left my hometown and with much relief, I found somewhere new to stay. It's smaller but, nice. I still keep an eye out for the channel and the Reddit user but I hadn't heard a peep from either of them, well that's not entirely true. While I was unpacking all my things I pulled my laptop from its case, the one I'm using right now and heard something hit the floor. A slim black USB stick. Without thinking twice I just assumed it was mine and plugged it in. There was only one file on the USB, an MP3 and with one click all the paranoia and uncertainty came flooding back. All with one song playing in my ear. &amp;#x200B; The cat came back, the very next day. The cat came back, we thought he was a goner But the cat came back; &amp;#x200B; It just couldn't stay away."

5,cyber-crime,nosleep,Mrs Jameson,2,btppkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/btppkf/mrs_jameson/,2019-05-28 04:48:15,"I moved into my old residence in a nice, suburban, Middle American area a couple of months back with my dog Isaac. It was my first property that I'd ever owned, and the first time I'd ever lived alone. I'm 24 years old, and I like to think I'm pretty well off in my job as a cyber security techinician. I did get lucky with the price, and got a bit of help from the parents, but I make enough to get by pretty reliably on my own. The house is just big enough, detached, with a nice big garden for Isaac. He's getting old, but he still enjoys a trot around outside at least once a day. I lived pretty far from my home town, so getting to know my neighbours was my number 1 priority after getting settled. Luckily for me, Mrs Jameson lived just behind my new house. After introducing myself to all of the neighbours on my street, and finding none of them particularly friendly or interesting, I decided I'd at least stop by and say hello to Mrs Jameson since our houses were in such close vicinity. My kitchen window was opposite hers, with both gardens inbetween, and it was likely that I'd make awkward eye contact at some point so I thought it best to introduce myself first. Mrs Jameson was a delightful but desperately sad older lady who's husband had passed not long before I moved in. She regarded herself a 'tough old bird' but I knew the pain still lingered. She had no children, and so was all alone in that house. I secretly vowed to keep an eye on her, since it would be particularly easy due to the kitchen window situation. Upon meeting her for the first time, she invited me inside and we sat in that kitchen and drank tea, a drink I'm now particularly fond of after the fact. It was nice to have a motherly figure in my life after moving away from home, and in retrospect I think I probably need Mrs Jameson more than she needed me. She spent most of her time sitting in that kitchen reading or listening to the radio. She'd told me when I first met her she preferred the company of older forms of entertainment, and sitting at the kitchen table meant she could go for short walks outside more easily. She'd always smile and wave whenever I would be by my own kitchen window. It's a depressing fact of life that your mind starts to wither along with your body as you age. It's a fact that none of us can avoid, and neither could Mrs Jameson. Several weeks had passed since our first meeting, and I'd already seen a change in her eyes whenever we spoke. The spark that was there, just visible under the pain, seemed to be slowly dimming. She'd also started to spend less time outside, preferring to sit in silence at that kitchen table. In general conversation, she'd gone a bit...odd too. Repeating things she'd already said, making out of context remarks, the usual signs of dementia. Perhaps I hadn't noticed it before, but it was a drastic change in such a short amount of time. Then, I didn't see her for a few days. Her house was quiet, the lights out. I assumed she'd gone on holiday, and perhaps I'd thought too much of our friendship but I was hurt that she wouldn't tell me so, or even mention it in our prior conversations. But just as suddenly as she was gone, she came back. If it was a holiday she'd been on, it seemed it had taken the last bit of spark she had left in her. Now she only sat at that kitchen table, looking more even more ill, grey, withered. No books or music. I could only see her head and face where she sat next to her kitchen window, but even without seeing her fully I knew she wasn't doing well. I called by a few days after she returned, carrying homemade brownies. I know, it's like I'm an old lady myself. I'd seen she was in through the kitchen window, but she didn't answer the door. There were many reasons an older lady might not answer the door, but Mrs Jameson was not your typical older lady. She was a veteran of life, with the scars to prove it, and never let her ailments get in her way. I was worried, but wrapped the brownies and left a note saying I hoped she had enjoyed her holiday. A few more days passed, with Mrs Jameson still sat in that chair by the window. The brownies were gone when I drove by her house on the way to work the day after I visited, but she still hadn't spoken a word to me since her return. I assumed I''d offended her in some way, and left it at that. Night after night I'd see her in that chair. More ill, more grey, more withered. Every night. Physically she looked worse every day, but it was a slow progression at first. That was, until I swore I saw something wriggling around her neck. Steven Weston was a 5'1 imp of a man with deep seeded ego issues and a flair for the dramatic. His ugly appearance and short stature meant he'd spent his life trying so desperately to garner some form of attention, fame, any sort of recognition. I know this because I read his autobiography published a few months after his arrest. Steven had written the first draft while he was in Mrs Jameson's basement. She'd never been down there since her husband had died, there was no need. It was perfect for Steven, who'd done this routine many times before. Despite being a man obsessed with becoming known, his M.O was, to put it lightly, disgustingly cowardly. Steven had a background in heating engineering, and would rig the boilers of his victims to produce Carbon Monoxide gas. He'd then kill the already weak and vulnerable victims after they were suitably poisoned to his liking, which could take weeks. It was the actual murder of the victims where Steven's dramatic flair would come into play. Vile, gruesome murders. Dismemberments, decapitations. Messages in blood on the walls. Guts strewn about the house of the victim. He left a pair of legs, just the legs, in a pair of long boots stood propped against a wall near a victim's house. The rest of the body was never found. By the time Steven had enacted his plan on Mrs Jameson, his great theatrical murder show was nearing its close. He'd always planned to be caught, but his crimes were committed with just the right amount of brutality to garner a reputation, and with just enough thought to avoid capture. Steven was arrested outside Mrs Jameson's home a few months after I'd moved in. I'd called the cops in. Steven had always left clues to his murder in the crime scene, and for his final performance he'd needed a good one, a big enough clue to get him caught, &amp;#x200B; That's why he'd cut off Mrs Jameson's head and placed it on the windowsill."
6,cyber-crime,nosleep,I care about my roommates,1,bux353,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bux353/i_care_about_my_roommates/,2019-05-31 05:02:06,"A few things to get out of the way, A. I'm not selling names, so I'll refer to everyone via a nickname. B. I live in a home with 3 roommates, all of which girls, all of which college age. Lucky me? No, once every month I need to take a fishing trip and I have my eyes set on someone else. And C. I dislocated my knee some years ago and never fully recovered thanks to the fact I didn't have a professional set it in place and the doctor at the ER is an asshole, so I walk with a cane, giving me the feeble old man look, but the cane was a gift from a special someone, so I don't mind, I am capable of walking without it, but not long without pain. D. I'm retired, but I'm not of the typical age, a few minor lotteries, smart investing, and working your ass off for years can get you set pretty damn well. I care for my roommates, I act as a father figure to people when I can out of instinct, plus they don't ask questions, which makes my day to day easier. The one with black hair, let's call her Nessie, she works at a coffee shop, not much special, good girl, listens to music most of the day, I don't mind though. The blonde, Pixie, had depression, I won't delve into the details, but I helped her out of a bad spot and now she works at a mall kiosk. The brunette, let's call her... Erm... Fuck it, Kitty, she's pretty alright, works one of the local pet stores, but she drinks too much, which I normally wouldn't mind if she didn't leave cans everywhere, but it's whatever. I'm not gonna lie, it was pretty good, only had to pay quarter of the bills, was able to spend as much time as I wanted alone, and I have people to celebrate with. It was nice. That was until Pixie's dad died and her scumbag uncle showed up. Yeah, imagine every stereotype of the rich, douchebag uncle, and that's this creepy fat fuck, Fatso. Here I am, trying to comfort Pixie, and this fat pile of shit shows up on our door step, my fucking door step, and starts talking about money. Nessie was going to be nice, bless the girl, but I wasn't tolerating any of that shit. I walked up and slammed the door shut. I suppose that this is what lead to Fatso and his group of thug buddies cornering me at my car as I was leaving for a fishing trip. Big man, needing 3 other guys to intimidate little ole me. I wasn't even paying attention, I could probably just fill this with stereotypical bullshit and be atleast 80% accurate, but they did get a reaction out of me, though probably not the one they wanted. One of them ripped the cane out of my hand and threw it into the dirt. I calmly went to get my cane back, brushed it off, made my way back to my car, and one of them tried to stop me, but all I had to do was put up a finger and touch his jugular for him to panic and back off. I took one last good look at them before leaving. One in a track suit, Tweedle Dipshit, one in basketball clothes, Cock Nose, and one in a hoodie and cargo shorts, Dumbass. And so started my project. One of the most important things about fishing is patience, waiting, and what better way to pass the time than to do a bit of cyber stalking. Fatso moved in down the street from us, of course, why wouldn't he? Dipshit lived in the suburbs, but Cock Nose, and Dumbass all lived in shitty parts of town and had some lovely rap sheets to peruse. Armed robbery, conspiracy, DUI, possessions of drugs, and so much more. This was gonna be easy. Dipshit seems to try and cover his trail a little bit, a job at construction. Cock Nose and Dumbass don't have any noted jobs but have recent arrests for selling drugs and mugging people. I guess even middle aged men sometimes don't figure shit out and stop committing pathetic crimes. Now, it's not like I'll know where they'll be every moment of every day, but I'll have a good idea of where they'll be a good chunk of the day. I caught whatever I was gonna catch, so I went home. I wasn't shocked that Fatso had managed to convince Pixie to let him stay the night, Pixie was visibly unnerved by him, so I did the subtle things you do to calm people down. Of course, he was oggling the girl and in general being a creep, and the moment we were alone, he tried to muscle me again, going on about how he was gonna collect Pixie's dad's debt and blah blah blah, I don't get why people think that debt is inherited? You collect your dues before they die, after that, you're shit outta luck. He threatened to break my other leg and even pulled a knife on me. He was just trying to scare me, and failed, I could see him crack a bit at how I stayed calm. He was old, I was... Well, not *that* old, but much younger than him. I left him, and for the rest of the day he tried to pretend nothing happened, even trying to show how ""nice"" he was to me infront of the others. I already guessed his phone password earlier, 1230, swiped it and set an alarm. I was planning a rude awakening. 2 in the morning, I got set. Being the man in the house, naturally whenever there was need to do something manly, it was me, so nobody questioned me having so many tools in my room, and I'm an outspoken advocate for the second amendment, so no questions there either. I carted a small table out to the living room where the fat bastard was sleeping on the couch, and I'd walk back and forth, placing various tools on the table; A large knife, a hammer, a hatchet, a revolver, etc. I put 2 rounds in the revolver, and waited. The alarm went off at 2:30 and he woke up, panicked, I chose that especially annoying red alert alarm, and he squinted at me before asking, ""X? The fuck are you doing, you cripple piece of-"" He started to get up, but sat back down when he realized the situation, primarily me pointing a gun at him. ""Good morning\~"" I said in a little sing song voice, I had the control, and there was no way he was throwing his fat ass across the coffee table to do shit to me before I could pull the trigger, not that I had a bullet in the current chamber. ""X, what the fuck are you doing?"" He was wide eyed, clearly he'd never been on this side of things. ""It's not about what I'm doing, it's about what you're doing. In the words of Mr. Rogers, get the fuck out of my neighborhood, and never come back."" He was confused, ""Wait, what-"" I cut him off, ""Pixie doesn't owe you a penny. You're lucky I let you live this long after your stunts yesterday, so I suggest leaving before I change my mind."" He tried to say something, but before he could get it out, I pulled the trigger. *Click.* I'm pretty sure I heard him shit his pants. I opened the cylinder up to show him the 2 rounds before spinning it and slamming it shut, and planting the barrel against my head and pulling the trigger. *Click.* Before any of you freak out, the 2 rounds weren't real, it would've made a click sound no matter what. Sorry for fucking with you guys like that, let's keep going. He got the message, and he got the fuck out, but not before making a threat about getting his buddies over here. We were actually early, because I was planning on heading out myself. I got all nice and dressed up for incognito activities, drove to Dipshit's house, and got to work on some... Creative Destruction. You can't just cut a break line, it's too obvious. So, with a multitool I weakened the line before ripping it open, then I got in the car and buckled up, it was a pretty nice car, I admired it as I pulled the seat belt more and started cutting at it until it was at a nice, fragile width at the point, fraying the edges. Now for the fun part. I opened the car door, both in the normal sense and in terms of pulling shit off. It was a lot of work, but it wasn't gonna unlock from the inside anymore. Just in case I also tampered with the emergency brakes. It was done, and I had enough time to go get some fast unhealthy breakfast then come back and wait. I stayed out of sight and watched as he got in his car with a sledgehammer and drove in the direction of my house. I waited a little while before getting in my car and driving home, rolling right by the wreckage, and I'm so glad there are so many rubber neckers, and that the standards for road rangers dropped so low so I could slowly go by and see the product of my creation, a no longer beautiful car, and one dead motherfucker lying on the ground. That's another thing, road rangers are supposed to use their vehicles to block line of sight from bodies, but not anymore as of recent, not around here at least. Fucking weird. I a few pics and then took my sweet time getting home, long enough for news to spread around. When I got home, there was a distinct lack of middle aged men and old fat fuck waiting to kick my ass. How strange. Now, I can't just go around killing people in such a short time, I had to wait. And so I did, for about a week. Until I got bored and wanted to resume my project. Pixie's been silent lately, so I figured it's as good a time as any to go harass the harasser. It's not hard to break into a home, the hard part is covering up that you were there. I was in his house in moments, and I found Fatso's kitchen. How cute, a heart shaped cutting board and a really big chef's knife. Compensating for something, Fatty? Whatever. I stabbed the knife into the cutting board and left it on one of those weird dresser things you put in the hall just infront of his bedroom door. I wonder what they're called, hold on a tick. Uh, yeah, I think they're called console tables, but I digress, I leave and lock the door behind me. He has a shit fit, but nobody believes him, the police looking at him like a crazy old man that fits the stereotype perfectly and little ole me walking with a cane. A few days later I make my way into town, I've been doing a bit of research and identified a few different drug dens Cock Nose could be. I get in, disguised of course, and sure enough, I find his ass, barely lucid in a chair, and what's this? Young, fresh blood, a new recruit that's totally out of it, his skin only lightly marked with tattoos these idiots usually get in the gang, and look, there's his gun, with his finger prints and DNA all over it, and here's me, with gloves, taking his gun. I am almost tempted to put one between newbie's eyes, but he'll probably learn something in prison. Okay, probably not, but it'll keep the heat off my ass, so I point the gun at Cock Nose and shoot him multiple times. I didn't count, so let's just say I shot him... Six times? Whatever, there was instantly a panic, I tossed the gun aside and with nobody thinking straight I took a selfie with the body before leaving. My plan worked perfectly as the news later that night detailed a shooting of known gang affiliate and a recruit for the gang being arrested and charged with second degree homicide. Time to wait again. So, at this point, it's been a while, and I'm cleaning the house for everyone, and you don't need to be a rocket scientist to notice Pixie has been very anxious lately and put 2 and 2 together that Fatso is probably harassing her either over the phone or maybe at work. I found razors and rope in her room. I said nothing and took them. That night, I got back into Fatso's house and decided to fuck with him. I moved things around in his home and hid razor blades where he'd have to grab things. Much riskier, but the other thing I was oh so tempted to do was to just burn his house down. I wasn't gonna wait, I went to Dumbass's house. Of course the prick had drugs out in the open, and he was inside on the phone. It's normal for dealers to lace shit into their product, so no one would look twice at anyone other than the dealers if it was tampered with. I quickly got rid of a bit of whatever was in the syringe and replaced the small amount with poison and went into hiding. It took a while, but he came out and he was gonna do it. Was. He must've been paranoid from his friends dying, because he stared at the syringe for a long time before pitching it. Looks like we're going to do things the hard way. Cane off the ground in one hand, hammer in the other, I made my way into his house. He was expecting me, because immediately I had to duck a knife before trying to smash him in the head with the hammer, and this Dumbass was actually much more skilled than I had expected, because before I knew it he had disarmed me of the hammer and knocked me quite a ways back. He charged me with the knife and hammer, but I side stepped him and tripped him with my cane. I didn't mention this, but if you get the Smokey Mountain catalog, it's one of those canes where it's like ""this is what Bruce Lee uses for"" blah blah blah and it has the ""design of an axe"", so it was really effective at tripping him and I gave him a good hit to the back of the head. Now, he's still breathing, but I can't just outright kill him, not in his own home. Nope, I've got to set this up. So, I find more of his drugs and inject him, I take the rope I took from Pixie's room and make a noose, you know, it really is easy to make a noose, and there are fun tutorials on Youtube, Internet's a Hell of a thing, ain't it? I then also open his computer to a site of *""quality""*, drag him and a chair to the noose, get him all stood up and hooked his head into the noose, pull his pants and shit down, and oh my God he's starting to wake up, this is perfect timing. I kick the stool out from under him and step back to watch, and it didn't break his neck, so now he's flailing around, swinging, trying to get out, but he can't, so I go get my hammer and I watch until he's done and take a picture. I leave, locking the door behind me. There might be a tiny bit of evidence of a struggle, but it can be overlooked easily, and staying any longer only increases the risk of being caught. I go back home. It's been a short while, and the girls are getting concerned, now Fatso is going around applying pressure to all the girls about how he wants money from Pixie. He threatened Nessie that if she couldn't get Pixie to pay up, he was going to severely injure them both. He told Kitty he was going to collect from us all if he had to. And he told Pixie that he was gonna get what he's owed one way or another. Night time rolls around, I roll in, he knows not to sleep, but it doesn't help him as I plant the tip of my blade against his jugular. He starts blubbering, saying that everyone can forget about the money, he'll never show his face again. I tell him to call the girls and tell them. Of course, I didn't actually care how sorry he was, I wanted a good excuse for his disappearance, and a distraction to steal his banking info. He's completely forgotten my Modus Operandi, or M.O, which is that I visit him, give him a scare, and then I kill someone. I give him a few days to establish that he's leaving, sever ties, get ready to move to a nice isolated location where he can ""Never hurt anyone again"", whatever, he is trying to play how he's gonna be good, but that place is fucking amazing, he's doing himself a favor. He goes out to pay the people he's got on his payroll their final checks, and I go into his home and nail a large board infront of his front door along with a Leaf Net, sort of netted tarp. A few hours later, he comes home, and just as I planned, he tripped, landed square in the middle of my net, and he stays still, knowing better than to push his luck as I wrap him up in the Leaf Net with one hand and gun pointed at him in the other. I dragged him into my car, and started driving off, and he began begging for his life, offering to go to another country, offering to completely change his identity, offering me money, the wealth of material goods, the power of leading charge of a pitiful little gang of thugs. Fucking street rats is what they are, back in the Mob we were committing crime, yeah, even violent crime, but we had respect, order, we didn't fuck with the common man for no good reason, and we sure as shit didn't eat our own. We got to the docks, and I threw his ass into the boat with a satisfying smack. The nice thing about owning a boat is that most of the people that own them hardly use them, so nobody is around when I go take it out, and it was nice sound. The waves, the birds, the rocking of supplies on the ship, the click of my cane against the deck, and the sobbing pleas of a little bitch that can't accept that he fucked up, and it's all over for him now. I took him out into the ocean, and he tried to escape a few times, so I took a hatchet and hacked into his legs a bit. He's never getting out of here even if he could get at me. Nobody on shore would hear us, and not a single vessel for miles and miles to stop me. I'll admit, I took my time and pleasure in chopping him up, but in the end, I did end his suffering by planting my axe into his skull before the half way mark. After I was done, I ground up what I could and dumped him into the water, attracting fish. I caught a good, hefty amount of fish, gutted them and ground them up to cover up the mess, caught a lot more to avoid suspicion, sailed back to shore, sold it, and went straight back home. I began slowly draining his account, the same way he would spend as to avoid suspicion, and used moving trucks to move valuables to a guy I know and sell them, including his car, which fetched me a pretty penny, soon, everything of Fatso in my little town was either gone or chopped up and sold off as parts. Quite frankly, the ""power vacuum"" left by that fat fuck was so small, it was barely noticeable, fortunately someone much more competent filled his space. In general, things are so much better without that fat, creepy, piece of shit. Asides from shit in town, the girls are much happier, doing so much better. They may not know what exactly I did, but they know I did something big for them, so I guess they live life happier knowing that the lame cripple living in the room down the hall will be more than capable of keeping them safe. Nessie is working excellently, she even got a promotion at the coffee shop, and in her free time she's trying her hand at singing and song writing, filling the house with beautiful music in the evening, Pixie smiles all the time now, and she quit her job at the kiosk, getting a nicer much higher paying job, and Kitty, well, Kitty is still working at the pet store, but she's happy. Things are nice, and with everyone getting their happiness, I will soon have my reward for feeding the fish. At night, I went back out onto the water, sailing deep into the ocean and to a small island, and there she was. She had long, red hair, blue eyes, a flowing black dress, and pleasantly plump features. She may have had a mouth full of razor sharp teeth, but I don't mind. I got to see her so much more often back when I was working, but with less need to feed the fish, the less she'd show herself to me. We'd have a night together, and whenever I see her, I know she's hungry, and I offer her my heart, but as always, she'd just eat a fish and tell me that would be too sweet for her heart. Heh. This time, she offered me something. She gave me all the jewelry and valuables I forgot to take off of Fatso, plus something special, a ring and a necklace, each with a lovely Spinel stone. We enjoyed eachother's company for the night, but sadly, we simply couldn't stay. I'd get back on my boat, she hands me my cane, we kiss, and I have to leave her and return to my normal life. It's sad, but thankfully it has purpose. I care for my roommates, so I watch over them, I help them through life, I pay bills, and I make people better, I make their lives better. I'm retired, I fish, and I take on Pet Projects cleaning trash and feeding the fish."
7,cyber-crime,nosleep,I ran the biggest underground torture and murder operation on the internet  here is my story,5,bjy12w,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bjy12w/i_ran_the_biggest_underground_torture_and_murder/,2019-05-03 04:00:50," [URL I never thought Id find myself watching a guy chisel his toes off with an icepick. Or see someone get strangled to death. And I definitely didnt think Id end up working for the biggest, underground murder network in the world. I should back the story up. It was the summer of 2016. The summer Pokmon Go took over. The summer of the Rio Olympic Games. It was the summer I stumbled upon a door to a world I wish I never set foot in. The door that changed my entire view of humanity. I was always the type of person to search for an adrenaline rush. In school I would skip class for the rush of potentially getting caught by an administrator. I used to shoplift shit from random stores to feel the rush, later to throw the stuff I stole away in a garbage bin because I didnt really need it. And I searched the internet far and wide for the most outrageous, outlandish, sick shit you could find  all for the chase of the rush. One of my favorite pastimes in the summer of 2016 was browsing through Not Evils, Troll Scroll. Despite the constant pestering of sicko sex offenders (or soon to be) looking for their fix, the Troll Scroll has proven to be an informational source of sick (GORE) type shit for the sicko like me looking for the fix of an adrenaline rush. Most of the stuff posted in the GORE forums on the Troll Scroll are obviously fake. When a guy pops his eyeball out of his socket but the camera switches angles right at that split second the spoon is about to enter his eye, you know the dude is a phony, an imposter. But there are some legit GORE forums out there if you know how to find them. Getting a handle on where to search the Troll Scroll takes some time and some networking. This isnt a how to article, so I wont go into great details. But a helpful hint  no matter what you are searching for on the Troll Scroll  is to network and let your screen name (keep it anonymous ANON) be a rememberable one. My chosen name  SaintVoDka  is a rememberable name in the GORE community and showed a potential GORE forum operator I was serious about the hobby. Im not going to lie, it took a while to get established on the Troll Scroll as an ANON who could be trusted, but eventually I found the niche I was looking for. And more importantly, the people. One of the first ANONs (who name I will not repeat) led me to a trove of valuable old school GORE pictures. This ANON specialized in the old school original GORE. War pictures from World War II, World War I and the Civil War. The website ANON led me to had a black background with a bloody, 1950s style German helmet on it. In the background of the website there was music playing the song on repeat [8  50 mm. Repetiergewehr M.95](URL by the band 1914. There was a password prompt that gained you access to the website once ANON trusted you were not someone looking to compromise his hobby. The pictures on ANONs website were primarily filled with pictures of dead soldiers from the past wars. These were pictures you wouldnt find in any history book. They were exclusive pictures this guy somehow had access to. They were brutal, ruthless and cruel photos that showed the dark side of humanity. Becoming a paying member to ANONs war site led me to additional leads to the dark side of humanity. I found the video archives to the original [BME Pain Olympics](URL I found the infamous video (scrubbed from the internet) titled, Shocked mom walks in on her son cutting his toes off. And I also stumbled upon the door to the greatest evil I have ever set my eyes on. The Red Room. For those who dont know what the Red Room is and what it entails here is a quick excerpt [I pulled from Quora](URL *When I came across this word, I delved into this for a rigorous research and found some facts about the Bloody Room. I have read many of the real-life experiences (of those who been to Red Room) from Reddit and decided to spill out those points here: Red Rooms are the live video streaming Onion or Shadow sites with the option of live IRC chats along with Bitcoin payment. Now, does that ring a bell for you? Still no, then now I can explain. You can call Red Rooms as Virtual Harassment Terminal which includes many of the worlds heinous &amp; blatant coercion is being executed lively as per the inflow of Bitcoins to the Organizers, as per the orders of members in the Live IRC Chats. When you login to a Red Room, you might see the Harassment Scenario (say a Blindfolded women is being tied to a rope with a chair). Once the Room (Chat/Red Room) gets locked; there begins the Cruelty for Psychics. As the web cam will be placed for sure in the Crime Scenario; the actions will get reflected according to the chats in the IRC channel. Lets say a person say in chat: Smash her stomach, I paid $200. Then the hooded figure who is in charge to harass that women will do the same to her, once the payment gets confirmed.* *By this, the fate of that women shall be decided by the Red Room members. It is not illegal to be into Red Room, but I will not suggest you to be there, as with your presence in RR makes it indirectly tailed up with a Public Virtual Crime.* An ANON I met through an animal torture forum  posing as an Animal Liberation Front (think PETA)  gained me access to my first Red Room. All the Red Rooms look the same. Anyone who has scrounged the depths of the dark web has likely stumbled upon a Red Room unknowingly. The hyperlinks for Red Rooms are plastered all over the dark web if you know where to look. And if you do stumble upon one, it will lead you to a page with a password prompt. If you have access to the password be ready for a world of change. A world filled with filth and hate. When I put the password, I was given into the prompt, the website led me to a dark, gloomy room. The room had cement, dungeon like floors. The camera was angled up high so you could see the entire room from a birds eye view. In the middle of the room was a damaged, wooden chair that looked like it was the piece of a dining room set from the 70s. On the side of the screen was a chat room where other ANONs started logging in under gruesome names. Ding, FieldofScreams has arrived. Buzz, StraightFacedGangRape has entered the chatroom. Ping, Theonlymeatieatishuman has joined. It went on like this for 15 minutes. Statutorycompromise entered the chat room. Crownoftowers has joined the chatroom. Hammeringthenails has now joined. When all the Anons arrived, a broad-shouldered man carried out a slender, small person, with a burlap sack covering their face, and set them in the 70s era style chair. He proceeded to restrain the individual to the chair with ropes. The man with the broad-shoulders was wearing all black, no color he was dressed in. He carried the burlap covered individual like a sacrificial offering of virgin ears. He wore black combat boots you see the Neo-Nazis wear. And he wore a disturbing mask of a pig  with cut up, blood-stained cheeks, wild black hair that laid desolate across his broad-shoulders and bloody yellow teeth that jutted in every direction. An ANON named SELFDISEMBOWELMENT immediately typed into the chat terminal, TAKE THE SWINES SACK OFF! This was my first Red Room experience, so I had no idea what was going to happen, how the chatroom etiquette worked, or if what I was watching was real or fake. The broad-shoulder man in the pig mask ripped the burlap sack off the sacrificial offering. Long black hair danced off the offerings shoulders. Black mascara was stained on the high cheekbones of the lady in the chair. Red lipstick smeared across her lips. Her eyes were closed not like she was sleeping, but rather passed out from a drug. WAKE THE SWINE UP, DevouredCarcass typed into the chat terminal. Smack, the man in the pig mask slapped the passed-out lady across the face. Ah, what the fuck!, screamed the lady. Where am I? Who are you, she questioned with a frightened, panicked look on her face? $50 bucks to cut her fucking hair off, an ANON typed into the terminal. The man in the pig mask left the room and returned with dull, rusted scissors. When he began cutting her hair the sacrificial lady began screaming for help. Help, somebody please help me!, she shouted. $75 bucks to break her index finger! $100 bucks to punch her the face! $300 bucks to cut her face with a razor blade! It continued like this. ANONs behind their terminals were paying the man in the pig mask to torture this lady. The higher the dollar price went the sicker the requests got. $500 bucks to pour hot water down her throat! I started to get really into it. This lady was a patsy and we were in control. A God like aurora washed over me. Dopamine and endorphins slammed through my brain rocking my neurotransmitters responsible for the pleasure release. I was high from the adrenaline rushing through my body. When the masked man was about the pour steaming hot water down the patsys throat I sat up in the edge of my char in suspense. Suddenly my screen went black. A gray dialogue box popped up in the middle of my screen saying that the user named, ON-set-of-INFECTION, just paid $10,000 dollars to take the torture private for his own viewing. FUCK!, I screamed. Enraged spit spewed across my computer screen and infuriated fists pounded into my desk. I didnt realize it at the time of my rage  for I was more pissed off at what I was going to miss  but I was hooked, the Red Room became an internal addiction. A sick, dark hole with no ladder leading out. And I was plunging head first into the dark tunnel of no return. My weekends, which were once filled with the gazing rays of the summer sun and sand filled thongs, became occupied with the dark dungeon of the Red Room. At first my excuses to my once loyal friends was that I was sick, I had homework to do, my grandma is in the hospital  turned completely into ignoring every text I got. The Red Room hobby wasnt cheap, so I ended up picking up a second job delivering pizzas. I also had a nice windfall of $10,000 dollars from my late grandmothers estate that was passed along to me. To pay for anything in the Red Room required bitcoin. When I got my grandmothers estate, I immediately converted the $10K into bitcoin. Luckily, I timed this right with bitcoins meteoric rise, turning me into a multimillionaire in a few quick months. I now had enough cash to fund my Red Room addiction pretty much indefinitely. I quit my shitty job and networked online through dark web forums and talked with other fucked up individuals I met in Red Rooms. By 2018 my online persona grew to be quite infamous in the small Red Room circles I occupied. I was notoriously known for taking Red Rooms private for my own torture pleasure by dropping an easy $50K. With the amount of money I had, I was able to self-direct the hooded torture chamber man to do my bidding. The quantity of dopamine my brain unleased from a slow death by strangulation, beheading, drinking copious amounts of urine, or whatever, was unreal. I became a literal death God. A living angel of death. A Mashhit! And with the quick type on my keyboard and a few thousand bucks, I could decide the fate of anyone. I was a king! But as with any high, youre always chancing the white dragon. I found myself frequently reminiscing the first ordered kill I made. I wanted to feel that again. However, with every ordered kill after my first, the dopamine my brain released was unproportional. And then I met Baalberith. When you are giving orders to kill people through Red Rooms, you start to get suspicious about everything. What the hell is that van doing parked outside of my house! The mailman fucking knows, I just know it. I think my computer has been comprised. By the Spring of 2018 was I was on my way to becoming fully psychosis. Everything made me apprehensive. I must have gone through five different computers in three months out of pure insanity  frying the entire hard drives in each computer so the fucking FBI agents parked outside of my house (supposedly) would not have the records to send me to death row. The morning of April 20th was like any other morning. I made my coffee. Read the newspaper. Ate a protein bar. Then checked the crypto markets to see where my net worth would be quoted at today. Suddenly, there was a loud pounding on my door. Bang, bang, bang, my oak, front door shook. My heart fell into my gut and my flight or fight responsive was kicked into full gear. Im fucked, I thought to myself. I slowly creeped to the door and looked out of the peephole. A pale faced man with black, auburn looking hair stood on my front porch. I opened the door. The stranger stared at me with a big grin on his face. His teeth were crooked and yellow. He was wearing a black tank-top and faded blue jeans. He was a small guy, maybe 120 pounds at that. It is very nice to meet you, SaintVoDka, the man sneered. I grabbed the stranger by the collar and pulled him into my house, slamming the door behind me. Where the fuck did you hear that name, I shouted at him. Ha ha ha, the stranger laughed. Dont worry, your secret is safe with me. Explain yourself now, I screamed. Blood was pumping through my veins. The pulse in my temple was twitching. I grinded my teeth so hard I broke a tooth. I never really killed someone in cold blood before, but I was ready to end this guy. He knew my secret. He knew my Red Room name. Who the fuck was he? Relax man, the stranger said still grinning. My name is Baalberith. I am a friend. My blood pressure came down a bit. I grabbed a cigarette from my pocket and threw it into my dry, chapped lips. Sit down over there Baalberith, tell me what you know, I said as I lit the cigarette. Baalberith was the brains behind the Red Room operation. The Chief Executive Officer of the biggest, more profitable underground torture network on the dark net. He said him and his colleagues have been watching me for a while now. That they know exactly how much I have spent in Red Rooms and how many Red Rooms I have taken private for my own pleasure. We talked for hours. He told me everything about the Red Room operation. Told me how he got started in this sick industry, how many people were working for him, and answered any question I had. His operation made Peter Scullys, Daisys Destruction, look harmless. Then he offered me a job. I took the job and put my house on the market. I was off to start a new life. A new life in Iligan City, a coastal city in the South Philippines. Adjusting to life in Iligan City wasnt easy. Not only was I starting a new and demanding job but learning the native language of Maranao added additional stress to my life. I worked 6am until about 7pm every day. Baalberith was a demanding boss, but an excellent mentor. He had high hopes for me and wanted me to be his protg. With my demanding work schedule, I learned the ins and outs of Baalberiths operation. From the outside Baalberiths operation was a cyber security firm, a complete ploy to fool the authorities. Baalberith had about fifty people working for the cyber security wing. These guys had no clue that this was just a faade covering up the real operation. The core of the operation was the Beelzebub segment. This was the most important part of the business. The hand that went out and found the food to keep the Red Room alive. This is where I spent the majority of my time. Finding individuals to kidnap. My time at Beelzebub was spent working with a lady named Liezyl Margallo. Liezyl was a Filipino born in the small town of Basco. She had long brown hair, deep brown Betty Davis eyes, and a thin smile. She had to weigh only 90 pounds, but she was as ruthless and as dangerous as they come. Her operative alias was Shannon Carpio. Liezyl lived in an upscale condominium. She had an exclusive gym membership to a swank club. She spent her evenings drinking fine wine in posh dresses that would cost the average Filipino an arm and a leg. Her entire high-class lifestyle was funded by the Red Room Beelzebub operation. Most of my time spent with Liezyl was in her beat-up red Range Rover. Our time was spent looking for potential victims. I can still remember to this day Liezyl luring in a street prostitute with a few bucks hanging from her fingers. Prostitutes were the easiest prey. They were especially easy to get in the Range Rover  without causing a scene  and no one ever misses a street whore. The last thing the Philippian police want to do is track down a missing escort. Tourists were another market for us. The City of Iligan is known for its waterfalls. But not every waterfall is the same. If you are from the City of Iligan you know what waterfalls are safe and what ones are unsafe. Its basic street smarts. But tourists dont always have the pleasure of knowing what waterfalls not to visit. There is one waterfall Liezyl and I spent a considerable amount of time at looking for potential victims. It is way out in the boonies. Up in the eastern bound mountain range. You will get absolutely no service there and the local authorities dare not travel there. The last victims Liezyl and I captured, before the entire Red Room operation blew up, was a young couple from the states. I remember Liezyl vividly that day. She was wearing tight camo pants, a black tank top and a green military ball cap. Over the past year my relationship with Liezyl grew from a professional work relationship to a romantic one. Despite the romance we professed to each other, we kept it secret. Baalberith banned work relationships. In fact, he banned all relationships in general. He viewed relationships as a distraction. A nasty interference that would compromise the entire operation. In hindsight, I wished I paid heed to Baalberiths warning. I remember spending the afternoon paying more attention to Liezyl than monitoring my surroundings. Her bronze shoulders gleamed in the sun. Her smile radiated happiness. And her eyes trapped me into a soul upon which I could not leave. We spent that afternoon talking about our childhoods. Liezyl told me about the hardships she faced growing up in a poor family in the Philippians. I told her about the United States and the middle-class family I grew up in. She was amazed that I ended up working for Baalberith given my background. Everyone who works for Baalberith usually makes a fortune then moves to the United States for retirement  I did the exact opposite. When the sun was about to set, we were going to call it a day. That is when we heard a voice. The voice came from a young couple walking up the path that leads to the waterfall. The couple was young. In their early 20s. They were white and spoke clean English. Baalberith would pay us a considerable amount of we captured both the guy and the girl alive. Couples, especially white ones go for a hefty premium in the Red Room. There is sick underground fetish in the Red Room where sickos like me pay to watch a couple get tortured together. It wasnt hard kidnapping the couple. Liezyl distracted them and I snuck up behind them and knocked them out with a crowbar. An easy kidnap. Shit we have done hundreds of times to unsuspecting tourists. I swear I remember patting the tourist couple down. I recall specifically searching their pockets for a cell phone to destroy. And I remember not finding a cell phone. I can blame it on my lust for Liezyl  my Achilles heel. But my distraction for Liezyl likely led to the downfall of the entire Red Room operation. On the drive back to the Red Room, I looked the tourist couple in the eyes when they woke up from their haze of being knocked out. They were tied up, there was duct tape over their mouth and our windows in the red Range Rover were blacked out  tinted. The fear you see in a victims eyes is an indescribable feeling. Its a feeling of power. Of total control. When we got the couple back into the Red Room operation, Baalberith was pleased with the haul of the day. He gave both me and Liezyl our checks and asked if I could do him a favor and grab something he left in his car. That was the last time I saw Liezyl, Baalberith and the Red Room operation. When I was walking out of the back door to the parking lot, the local police agency was busting into the front door of the Red Rooms cybersecurity operation. Apparently, the couple Liezyl and I brought in somehow alerted the cops to their kidnapping and got them an exact location where they were. To this day I dont know if the couple had a cell phone stashed on them somewhere I missed, or if someone saw us kidnap them and reported us. When I heard the police sirens, I booked it out of there as fast as I could. I knew I didnt have anything at the Red Room operation that would lead the police to me. The only way the police would ever find out I was involved in the operation is if someone would snitch. But even if that happened, no one there knew my real name, not even Liezyl and Baalberith. The City of Iligan was crazy the next few weeks. All over the local television stations blared the capture of the notorious Red Room villains that were busted by a local police force. Pictures of Baalberith and Liezyl were blasted everywhere. The City of Iligan was hot. It was swarming with Federal Agents and I needed to get the fuck out of there. Eventually I ended up buying a one-way flight to London. I spent a few weeks in London collecting my thoughts and what I had left of my once  bandit lifestyle. Everything that I once knew was gone. Liezyl was in a Federal prison. Baalberith ended up killing himself in his cell. And the Red Room was officially gone. In due course, I made it back to the States. I live a quieter life now. I work a 9-5 to keep myself busy, to stay distracted. I have a fianc who I plan on marrying next summer. She has no clue about my past life running an underground murder and torture operation. She thinks I went to college to become a computer programmer and have been living the American Dream since. Every so often I see in online forums people talking about the infamous Red Room stories. Most people believe it was a hoax. They say the dark web is to slow to live stream videos  torture and murder videos at that. I sit back and chuckle. Reminisce the glory days of the Red Room. Then I collect the IP addresses of the non-believers and put them into my data base. Theyll believe in the Red Room one day. The day when I bring it back online and have my headhunters get my first victims."
8,cyber-crime,nosleep,I'm an UnderCover FBI Agent on The Deep Web. (Part one),23,ba4x9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ba4x9t/im_an_undercover_fbi_agent_on_the_deep_web_part/,2019-04-07 01:38:31,"My name is Special Agent Barry Allen . It's actually my code name. Given to me by my colleagues. You may recognize this name from the comic book character The Flash. I was given this name due to my quickness to obtain IP addresses , bypass firewalls and hack into certain deep web sites and shut them down. That is my area of expertise. However, I've also been assigned to a Joint Task Force before which tracked and arrested drug runners, firearms dealers and human trafficking rings. Believe it or not. The federal government is everywhere. Social media, Reddit, YouTube. You name it. We have our guys on it. We monitor everything. That being said, the FBI only has jurisdiction to operate within the borders of the United States. In this new digital age we find ourselves living, Cybercrime is much more of a direct threat. Now more than ever Yes in the past we feared as a nation, biological and chemical warfare. As an example, right after 9/11 the United States had an Anthrax attack. In the FBI, it was known as Amerithrax Letters were mailed containing anthrax spores to several news media offices and to Democratic Senators Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy, killing 5 people and infecting 17 others. Once the victim opened the letters they would immediately be exposed to the spores. Inhaling them is the most deadly form of the attacks. And it quickly destroys your immune and respiratory system's.Back then there were no known cures and it was difficult to treat as the symptoms often times confused doctors. The death rate once exposed was nearly 95% .No one was ever officially arrested or tried as the primary suspect for this horrific crime. If you ask me though, the scariest part of this investigation is where it led us.To a lab on an Army base. Essentially the US Army was weaponizing Anthrax using independent scientists specializing in microbiological warfare. Of course though, if you wanted to bring down Western Civilization today , all you'd have to do is manipulate or destroy our satellites and we would be back in the dark ages. Computers, banks , grocery stores and cell phones, power plants, even the water filtration system runs with electronics and the ability to communicate with satellites. Essentially, our world now depends on this. It's scary to think about. Especially when 14 year olds are hacking into the largest banks in the world from their mother's basement. Somehow they are able to bypass the best security systems we know of. (I personally believe they are using password skimmers) We joke in my department that in order to work for us, you simply only need to be smarter than a teenager. My background is in IT while in the military. While serving i also obtained several certifications and degrees in my field.. I worked alongside someone i never thought i would. Turns out the federal government often times hires former hackers to consult for them. In fact they have an army of internet soldiers at their disposal. I was actually trained by a convicted felon. It's been said he is one of the best hackers in the world. Eventually i was put in contact with men in the FBI. Essentially went through a series of rigorous tests to determine my operating field of work. After seeing our skills, they then placed myself and the felon on the Cyber Anti-Terrorism unit (or CAT as we call it) . Our first assignment was to locate a man on the Deep Web known only as Captain Death He runs this anonymous site in which the viewers would donate bitcoin to watch unspeakable acts of torture, mutilation and murder. Often times called Red Rooms. After searching for a while, clicking on every single link given to us, we found the exact link which directed us to the host site.We visited the website. For a moment the page was completely black. So we waited a few moments. Suddenly a bright red colored text appears across the top of the screen. Welcome! To the house of pain, tonight's events will commence in 2 minutes. Enjoy Looking over at my colleague, Jeff begins penetrating the sites security systems attempting to find the IP address of the hosts location. Viewing the site still with my eyes locked onto the screen. Using my laptop separate from Jeffs. The monitor goes black, Then a video attempts to load. Buffering now for several minutes. Any luck Jeff? I ask. I'm searching for a weakness in the security firewall. Give me a minute he responds. Frustrated i say, We may not have a minute Using access control, Jeff was able to find and manipulate the users login information bringing down the video before the it began. Believe it or not. One of the weakest points to a website can often times be it's login feature. Jeff found a vulnerability in the source codes software and exploited it. Still haven't found the guy. As that process is much more difficult. For now, we can rest a little bit easier knowing his account is compromised. The best hack is when you can invade a security system and not ever be noticed. This was not one of those instances. Who are you appears on Jeff's computer screen. He responds quickly The Dark Knight in bold green text as he looks over the offenders account. Attempting to track down banking information. Recent transactions. Even bitcoin exchange. Searching over the vast amount of data pouring into the site. Seems they have gone through great lengths to keep themselves hidden from the public. The Identity of the perp is still unknown. Patting Jeff on the shoulder i thank him for saving my eyes from witnessing god only knows what. I suppose for now it's a small victory. Let's take a break Jeff I urge. Shutting down our laptops we exit the dark cold room we sat in with monitors, computers, servers and many other electronic components all around us. One thing to remember, heat is the enemy of electronics. and for some strange reason, we enjoy freezing our asses off while hacking. Walking outside Jeff lights up a cigarette and takes a drag. Putting on his sunglasses Want one? He asks No thanks, they really break my concentration, I don't seem to function well with that in my system i reply he scoffs and quietly whispers (amateur) while choking and coughing. I smile and look up Yeah well at least I can breathe I say laughing. (A smile forming on ny face) We begin walking to a nearby restaurant. My phone lights up and rings loudly. It's my supervisor. Go for Barry I speak confidently. My boss is breathing heavily into the phone and says sternly What's the News on Captain Death? I begin to inform him on our progress and our struggles. Keep me posted Barry, good work. He says. (Not telling him Jeff did most of the work, i feel bad for taking credit for this one) Reaching the doors of the bar and grill, I notice a man sitting in the corner of the restaurant with his family. Jumping back quickly while peering around the corner. Jeff gives me a strange look as I inform him that man is a fugitive from an earlier investigation. I call in for back up and sit back in our unmarked unit waiting for the Cavalry to arrive as he is armed and extremely dangerous. 15 minutes pass as back up swarms the parking lot. We exit the vehicle and surround the building. Rushing in 12 men strong, guns drawn we make the arrest. Fortunately, he did not resist. No civilians were harmed on the takedown.This man has been on the run for months moving from state to state. I had previously set up a sting operation to illegally buy stolen guns from the man which had been arranged through the deep web. However , this particular sting was an in-person arms deal. He appeared very spooked and got away from us before the transaction was made. After searching his panel van today we found an entire armory of weapons. A few days pass and we now have a search warrant issued by the judge for his last known address. Confiscating all of his computers, hard drives and weapons. My partner and I found a hidden room below the living room floor boards with $1.4 million dollars in it. It also had passports and other documents. He was ready to flee the country for sure. Why he was out in public is beyond me. Though often times, men like him feel they are untouchable and above the law. It's several weeks later and work has been slow. (Not sure if that is good or bad) Until today that is, I began chatting on forums and meeting interesting characters in chat rooms. On the clear net and deep web. Today I met a dark shadowy figure online. He claims to have worked with a group of hackers who specializes in debit and credit card theft online. (Playing the part ask in a private chat) How much does this pay? Moments pass with no answer. I sit and wait for a response. A message appears with a link and a phone number. Contact him for a trial run, if you do well. He'll set you up with further work he writes. (Thinking for a moment, finally an adversary worth hunting) Typing quickly I say Who is he, do you know him personally? He responds rapidly and the text box closes after he writes Rule number one, no names! Fortunately I was able to copy the link and phone number before my computer screen went completely blank. Reaching for the burner phone i recently acquired i begin dialing the number provided. It rings several times. No answer. So i check out the link i copied. Right before i click on it. My phone lights up and rings beside me forcing me to jump out of my seat. Startled i look at the cell phone. Mildly confused as it reads 'unknown number. Quickly i answer the phone. A man on the other end speaks. How did you find this number? he asks. I inform him i was searching online for a while. Im new and im looking for work. I was told you're the man to call if i wanted some action, i need the money i implore. Competition is next week, meet at this address, winner gets a spot on my team, if you think you're up for the test, be on time he demands. I thank him and abruptly hang up. Jeff comes over to my place. He has some info on low level guys in the fraudulent/stolen debit card scheme. Using an unmarked and totally not suspicious surveillance van. We follow a few men on their day to day operations. For the most part, this portion of our job is the worst. Very daunting and boring. Sitting and waiting isn't exactly glamourous as the movies depict it to be. From what we can tell so far these men are using credit card skimmers. Victims of credit card skimming are completely blindsided by the theft. They notice fraudulent charges on their accounts or money withdrawn from their accounts, but their credit and debit cards never left their possession. How did the theft happen? You may be wondering, what exactly is this? Credit card skimming is a type of credit card theft where crooks use a small device to steal credit card information in an otherwise legitimate credit or debit card transaction. When a credit or debit card is swiped through a skimmer, the device captures and stores all the details stored in the card's magnetic stripe. The stripe contains the credit card number and expiration date and the credit card holder's full name. Thieves use the stolen data to make fraudulent charges either online or with a counterfeit credit card. These men have been using these small devices all over the local area and surrounding states as well. Targeting the nicer areas of town. Attaching the devices to the ATMs. Sitting a short distance away in their cars watching each victim approaching. Laughing all the way to the bank...so to speak. After several days of stake-outs. Out team makes the arrests. Finding blank cards, machines and large sums of cash on hand. After hours of interrogations we learn a much bigger scheme is in the works. The men inform us that they were merely a distraction for a much larger crime. My supervisor gives us clearance to make a deal with them. Lessening their charges if they are willing to cooperate. Speaking with the men for 3 more hours we learn what's really going on. The next few days are extremely tense as our offices try to warn all the banks and even get the media involved. Calling every bank, big and small we alert them of the situation that cybercriminals are poised to carry out an ATM cash-out, an operation that gives thieves access to untold sums of money by bypassing security measures on an ATM. If successful, the operation has the potential to be a heist unlike any weve ever seen. The FBI has obtained unspecified reporting indicating cyber criminals are planning to conduct a global Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cash-out scheme in the coming days, likely associated with an unknown card issuer breach and commonly referred to as an unlimited operation. These unlimited operations compromise financial institutions or payment processors by installing malware that allows hackers to exploit network access, allowing admin-level access. Once inside, they can disable fraud protection, raise maximum ATM withdrawal amounts (and transaction limits) and withdraw large sums of money. Millions, potentially. All theyll need to carry out the attack are debit and credit card numbers found on the dark web, and dummy cards, also known as blanks, to attach the numbers to. The cyber criminals typically create fraudulent copies of legitimate cards by sending stolen card data to co-conspirators who imprint the data on reusable magnetic strip cards, such as gift cards purchased at retail stores. At a pre-determined time, the co-conspirators withdraw account funds from ATMs using these cards. It's nearly a week later and im preparing for my tests. I have my laptop ready in its case. Im extremely nervous.The information given to me is that i am to meet at this very strange building on the outskirts of town. I have no idea what to expect. I must come in first place to become a member of the team and ultimately take down the leader of this cybercrime domestic terrorist. If things go according to his plan.He could potentially put the entire country on its knees and our banking systems would completely collapse.Chaos and madness will spread like wildfires. Millions of people unable to access their money will riot and destroy stores. Stealing food and everything they can get their hands on. The police will be overrun and unable to do anything about it. The military would most certainly be called in an attempt to regain order. Mass hysteria ensues. To the extremes we have never seen before. I must stop him. Before its too late. "

He opened a word processor. He centered the text to the middle of the page and typed one word. &amp;#x200B; JOIN &amp;#x200B; And then they printed hundreds of them. The pages were dispersed, hands were shaken, fists were bumped, laughs were had. &amp;#x200B; The next night in the empty town, the paranoid police now scrutinizing every corner and alley for the senselessness of whatever happened yesterday failed to notice the dozen or so shadows armed with staplers and reams of the message canvassing every block, every building, every sub-street, every message board, every business. A policeman saw a whitely ghost in the distance and shined his search light on it. What was it? He exited his car and got close. Read it. Benign? Probably. Didnt radio in. 5 others had the same experience. Probably one of the local crazies. And by the morning they realized the totality of the message. Do they take they take them down? Someone high up decided to wait it out and watch the local lawbreakers, perhaps theyd find a link. And thus nearly every waking person that day in that town saw JOIN. And many of them were intrigued. &amp;#x200B; They convened on the post office. Again the alarms rang. Again they wore black. They took stamps, I dont know how, they just did. They took envelopes. &amp;#x200B; They still had reams of JOIN. The folding party began. By the end they were guzzling water and trying to rid themselves of the taste of envelope sealant. They stylized them to look like wedding invitations. The return address didnt exist. The sending address were random finds on google searches in surrounding towns. &amp;#x200B; Will it work? &amp;#x200B; I think so. &amp;#x200B; The police were now interviewing locals with a relevant history. That was fine, they didnt have a history. The police were taking down the messages. That was fine too, it was already etched in to the local minds, spoken about in a hushed tone by the rumouresses. Some kind of perverted cyber movement, theyd seen the shows, the movies, some Guy Fawkes mask wearing weirdo on the fringe. Dorothy agreed. &amp;#x200B; An interlude: &amp;#x200B; Dorothy was a hairdresser with a successful businessman of a husband. They drank wine and talked about cruises with friends at dinner parties who replied with talks of Paris and Barthelona. Dorothy and her husband, Frank, replied with an annoying airport anecdote. Friends replied with the Trouble with the Hotel Front Desk in Maui thriller. &amp;#x200B; How awful. &amp;#x200B; Quite. &amp;#x200B; Have you heard the one about our favorite food we ate while we were in Italy? &amp;#x200B; No! Share, please! &amp;#x200B; So they told them about the authenticity of the pasta, and the rich flavors in the sauce, and how theyve never had pasta like that anywhere. And this kind of thing went back and forth. They spoke of House Hunters episodes, true crime, some terrible arty movie they saw with that Phoenix fellow, or was it Wilson? Anyways, it was dreadful. And how were the children? They were fine, Brendas developing in to a proper pianist, Little Timmy is having trouble with math. Everybodys preparing for Christmas. &amp;#x200B; This happens everywhere. You probably talk like this too. Wisps of nothingness, the same boring stories over and over and over. You might as well be jacking everybody off under the table. Even if you think this has some kind of value, you actually enjoy hearing about Barbaras travel hell (that costed her thousands of dollars), let me explain further. &amp;#x200B; As Dorothy is going on about the condition of the road on H Street (when in the hell are they going to fix the potholes?), and her subsequent friendship with local Council member Ms. Pattingly, cringing on the couch in the same room, or maybe one over, or maybe hes upstairs, or in the garage, or outside, or at a friends house theres some kid whose name wasnt mentioned by anybody.

They were becoming real to themselves, stepping out of the cold feeling modernity bestowed on them, like vacuous apparitions, parsed in to qualities, traits, descriptions, each less and less authentic with every birth, every consciousness, describing themselves publicly in an attempt to garner social validation on the most minute level. Each one attempting to coexist with the difficulties of their time, their age, while being forced by some gigantic mass-will to subsist psychologically on the soulless vindication of leading the life of a micro-celebrity, without the fame, fortune, wealth, power necessary to feed the void created by such a framework. Every displacement, abstraction, degrees of separation between an actual action and the mere description of it, or the claim that one would do that, according to their self-described qualities, characteristics, traits, in the public forum.

Things seem to go that way, numbers dont give you increasing variety of possibility because most people are dull and unimaginative, instead numbers give you increasing chance of whatever is already assumed possible happening everywhere, all the time, infinite. Most people are angry, quite frequently, and most people dont know what to do with it. Were always on the verge of ultraviolence, human beings coexisting, an old man that owns the hardware store down the street, the college kid at the coffee shop, the woman that works at the florists, theres nothing in any of it besides sheer will that keeps us on the edge of that monstrous psychical cavern. Violence. Violence. The old man has beat his submissive wife for decades, the woman has never had a successful relationship and subsequently harms herself, the college kid is prone to sexual assault with the use of several sleeping agents and subduing narcotics. Yet we buy their hammers, their roses, their mochas, its all so terribly fatal. Violence. &amp;#x200B; They were young and they were raised in this era where every cause had a flaw, and every cause was owned, played as a pawn in some overarching socio-political schema. There werent any Hitlers or Napoleons, there was no objective evil. Nothing. Violence. The youth of the age seemed to flow in the wind like fallen leaves. Violence. Passionless and static. Violence. Every meaning unto a screen. Violence. Unknowing awesome potential. Violence. Shifts in some invisible plates. Violence. Billions of children. Violence. Look up at us across that deepest cavern.

And were all standing here, kind of huddled. We look around at the others, everybody looks warm and interested. We can see their breath. That guys fucking tall isnt he? Jesus. And now the black of the screen consumes our vision, and it feels like falling in to pure nothingness. And I flip over as Im falling, youre above me.

Of course it did. &amp;#x200B; They entered. &amp;#x200B; They wore black and ski masks with the bit at the bottom up so they could see each other smile. &amp;#x200B; Everyone was smiling. &amp;#x200B; They went to the appropriate aisle and grabbed what they needed. &amp;#x200B; The printer paper was loaded in to green milk crates.

He opened a word processor. He centered the text to the middle of the page and typed one word. &amp;#x200B; JOIN &amp;#x200B; And then they printed hundreds of them. The pages were dispersed, hands were shaken, fists were bumped, laughs were had. &amp;#x200B; The next night in the empty town, the paranoid police now scrutinizing every corner and alley for the senselessness of whatever happened yesterday failed to notice the dozen or so shadows armed with staplers and reams of the message canvassing every block, every building, every sub-street, every message board, every business. A policeman saw a whitely ghost in the distance and shined his search light on it. What was it? He exited his car and got close. Read it. Benign? Probably. Didnt radio in. 5 others had the same experience. Probably one of the local crazies. And by the morning they realized the totality of the message. Do they take they take them down? Someone high up decided to wait it out and watch the local lawbreakers, perhaps theyd find a link. And thus nearly every waking person that day in that town saw JOIN. And many of them were intrigued. &amp;#x200B; They convened on the post office. Again the alarms rang. Again they wore black. They took stamps, I dont know how, they just did. They took envelopes. &amp;#x200B; They still had reams of JOIN. The folding party began. By the end they were guzzling water and trying to rid themselves of the taste of envelope sealant. They stylized them to look like wedding invitations. The return address didnt exist. The sending address were random finds on google searches in surrounding towns. &amp;#x200B; Will it work? &amp;#x200B; I think so. &amp;#x200B; The police were now interviewing locals with a relevant history. That was fine, they didnt have a history. The police were taking down the messages. That was fine too, it was already etched in to the local minds, spoken about in a hushed tone by the rumouresses. Some kind of perverted cyber movement, theyd seen the shows, the movies, some Guy Fawkes mask wearing weirdo on the fringe. Dorothy agreed. &amp;#x200B; An interlude: &amp;#x200B; Dorothy was a hairdresser with a successful businessman of a husband. They drank wine and talked about cruises with friends at dinner parties who replied with talks of Paris and Barthelona. Dorothy and her husband, Frank, replied with an annoying airport anecdote. Friends replied with the Trouble with the Hotel Front Desk in Maui thriller. &amp;#x200B; How awful. &amp;#x200B; Quite. &amp;#x200B; Have you heard the one about our favorite food we ate while we were in Italy? &amp;#x200B; No! Share, please! &amp;#x200B; So they told them about the authenticity of the pasta, and the rich flavors in the sauce, and how theyve never had pasta like that anywhere. And this kind of thing went back and forth. They spoke of House Hunters episodes, true crime, some terrible arty movie they saw with that Phoenix fellow, or was it Wilson? Anyways, it was dreadful. And how were the children? They were fine, Brendas developing in to a proper pianist, Little Timmy is having trouble with math. Everybodys preparing for Christmas. &amp;#x200B; This happens everywhere. You probably talk like this too. Wisps of nothingness, the same boring stories over and over and over. You might as well be jacking everybody off under the table. Even if you think this has some kind of value, you actually enjoy hearing about Barbaras travel hell (that costed her thousands of dollars), let me explain further. &amp;#x200B; As Dorothy is going on about the condition of the road on H Street (when in the hell are they going to fix the potholes?), and her subsequent friendship with local Council member Ms. Pattingly, cringing on the couch in the same room, or maybe one over, or maybe hes upstairs, or in the garage, or outside, or at a friends house theres some kid whose name wasnt mentioned by anybody. The kid doesnt know why everything that drips (thickly) out of his parents mouth is so insufferable, like nails on a chalkboard, why it all seems so suspicious, theres something so fragile about all of it, he just felt that way.

11,cyber-crime,nosleep,Blue Beelzebub (Part 1),1,a41ecm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/a41ecm/blue_beelzebub_part_1/,2018-12-08 03:23:15,"&gt;For years, years, I wondered  why me  you know, you know, kiddo  why me  but there is no why me. What? As if there were, you know, chosens, theres no chosens  theres no allseeing, allknowing powerful nothing. It happened. Thats it. I fell for it. I took its bait  hook, line, sinker. Didnt I do it to myself? Wasnt I the sucker? Theres no why me  and once I realized that, that there was no, that there was no, no any kind of justice what so ever, until I acted, that gave my existence purpose. And now Im gonna fulfill that purpose. I dont want you getting involved. Youre deep enough as it is. Dont be the sucker! &gt; &gt; Bobby Mortaren; famous last words I raced from the house to the hotel, at Walsenburg, where I struggled to make sense of everything that transpired. I poured myself over notes and records that I had brought along. Only my laptops glow illuminated the room. Every so often lights through I-25 swept across the bed. Every so often breezes stirred trees around the perimeter. Soon midnight passed. The world darkened, relaxing as it were into slumber. A knock rattled the door - and I could have shrieked if it werent for what remained of my nerves. All of a sudden, I felt so icy, so cold, that I stood, frozen, uncertain of how to proceed. Who was it? It couldnt be good. Not the FBI. Not the Thules. Ache, already? I balked at chucking my laptop - whoever they were at the door, theyd find it, theyd find it. Its the 21st century; evidence doesnt vanish without a trace. As my heart pounded my chest, I reached that door and cracked it a notch. I braced for the kick certain to follow. It didnt come. The hotels courtyard / lot spread, deserted except for my rented Wrangler. There wasnt anyone - anyone who may have been my visitor. Yet - by my feet - at the edge of the threshold - my visitor had left a box. I poked at it with my pole and turned it over and over. It wasnt postmarked. It wasnt addressed. It had been delivered by hand and, suspecting what it was, I yanked it inside. Leaning onto and drooping against the door, I tore its lid. The box contained two floppies, a CD, and a stack paper. It was Blue Beelzebub - all of it, every part of it. As well as instructions: a How-To-Guide for destroying your future, fetched onto my doorstep, white-glove-style to boot, as promised. It may as well have been a bomb. \### How did Blue Beelzebub mutate into my obsession? Worse - did I expect to find its truth remarked into code from 1996? 1996! There wasnt a lot to the internet way, way back when. But crime was crime no matter its era. Was it crime? And did the game start this way or that way then evolve into crime? Was it crime from its start? The programmer of Blue Beelzebub, a hacker by the avatar ZuZu, claimed to be legit. Their MO had been to create games not scams. Or so it appeared until Blue Beelzebub entered the story. If it were a product of malware, why had ZuZu devoted so much of their effort into its creation? Why had they boasted of the games nitty gritty details during its gestation? Why all of that trouble, if only a fraction of it would have been appreciated by those who played it? Even LVN, when they werent laundering bitcoin, expressed what may be described as passion for that game. Was it a game? By 1996 standards, its demos parlayed atrocious graphics and threadbare mechanics. The way it affected the players rig ensured nobody would be eager to replay it. The game passed every scan available yet it twisted the OS and hijacked the PC to serve as a node, a link into a yet-unknown and yet-unnamed network for purposes every bit as mysterious as the game itself. As I contemplated the reality of the situation, I settled onto the notion that that game may have been a gimmick to cover truly malevolent intentions. That had been the crux of LVNs KickStarter and GoFundMe rackets - they always proposed plausible if lofty projects as if they were real, actual products people buy. However, case after case demonstrated that their pretense unraveled after scrutiny. Could it be, as far back as 1996, the creator(s) of Blue Beelzebub conceived of such a deception? FPS (of the type Blue Beelzebub reported to be) were the rage through the 90s. If so then their MO resembled that of a typical bait-and-switch scheme - bait them with a game, switch them with a virus. Then? What? Profit? \### In the summer of 2017, Czech authorities in conjunction with the EU, arrested LVN at their apartment south of Plzen. They seized the hackers laptop, PC, as well as their twenty thousand CD library. LVN was a hacker-for-fire; evidence presented at their arraignment demonstrated to the court that they had been paid by Russian and other Eastern European actors to pilfer bitcoin wallets. In addition to theft, the court entertained charges connected to a NiceHash heist of 64 million euros earlier that year. It was the breach of NiceHashs security that brought my skills to the EUs attention. For a few weeks, between March and May, I played my part to aid the investigation and the conviction of its mastermind. We discovered that the breach had been directed from inside NiceHash. We split the work: brick and mortar detectives ran interviews and stakeouts while my fellow white-hats and I toiled at the forensics. To meet our end of the bargain, we created a model of that cyber-attack, in order to construct and deconstruct its operation. As we realized how the crime had been executed, we identified the party responsible for it and built the authorities a solid chain-of-evidence - a chain-of-evidence that identified LVN as the perpetrator. LVN masterminded not just that NiceHash heist but a dozen scams at sites like KickStarter and GoFundMe. LVN traded exclusively through bitcoin. Their MO was to sow fake projects then to reap real funds submitted by backers - by backers who aimed to launder money via its exchange into bitcoin. Projects were advertised to those who sought the service; they were fraudulent through and through yet they appeared real enough to fool the maintainers of those sites and the public at large who may have been tricked by the scams. Under the supervision of the investigation at large, I pledged my dollars to a few of LVNs projects, to see what the response would be. Soon, LVN and I exchanged emails. They wanted to speak face-to-face. In front of the experts, I played to type and gained access to a roster of services from that hacker-for-hire. As a result of the communication, the investigation brought into play anti trafficking &amp; exploiting agencies from around the world and accelerated their goal to convict LVN. One of the projects LVN advertised didnt fit into the mold in so far as it felt like a genuine hobby of theirs. LVN sought investors to fund their (re)development of a game, Blue Beelzebub. The project listed at KickStarter - removed but saved to my laptop - included a lightbox of images and demos as well as snippets of code. It discussed such esoterics as: updates to its physics engine and its video &amp; audio renderer; upgrades to its arsenal and its gallery of foes; changing its play - expanding its levels and ditching its linearity. The details impressed me as they perplexed me. Why? I kept asking. Whats the idea? Whats the racket? Why create a game using twenty year old technology? I understood its esoterics perfectly for I came of age during the 90s. So much of what went into Blue Beelzebub felt familiar as it was familiar. An FPS - first person shooter - propelled by a fork of that fabled, 2.5D DOOM engine. Little wonder that its caps parlayed the look and feel of classic 90s PC games! Maybe it was yet another scam? Or - maybe - it was a hobby of a gamer / programmer? Could it be that LVN recalled those early DOS games and wanted to re-create the era? But that wasnt everything. And as I mused &amp; Googled I started to ask myself if there wasnt more about Blue Beelzebub beyond the haze of my nostalgia. I failed to connect the dots although that did not shake the deja vu - somehow, someway, I recognized that game. \### Escape published my article about LVNs conviction. Against the advice of my editor, I stalked its commentary, to see what, if anything, the story drew out of the woodwork. Its aside re: Blue Beelzebub attracted attention. I wasnt surprised, to be honest, as I had inserted it into the text to draw reaction. And my rouse worked! But I wasnt the only one who felt deja vu about the game. A commentator, who asked for anonymity, posted a link to 4CHAN about Blue Beelzebub. LVN had advertized the KickStarter for the game at a group devoted to indie developers. LVN never advertized their work at 4CHAN out of fear of exposure. So that thread where they didnt ask for money confirmed my sense that it wasnt, necessarily, a scam. As I scanned that thread, however, I realized what a rabbit-hole the business would be. After LVNs post, anonymous replies went to and fro as they typically do. Then the tenor of the thread devolved into a war amongst those who were for vs. those who were against what LVN proposed to do with the game. It was a question about credit. At last - somebody revealed a truth I duly suspected of - that Blue Beelzebub wasnt the work of LVN - that the game as it existed predated LVN by twenty years or so. The idea for Blue Beelzebub had floated about USENET c. 1995. The majority of the conversations extracted from the archives suggested that the game was vaporware. Its supporters countered that either a P/C or a DEMO existed and that a play-through had been uploaded to (early) YouTube. Everyone who added their opinion - pro &amp; con - agreed that it was inspired by Satan, took its cues from Crowleys Thelema, and that it included clips replete with ever more corrupt gore and snuff. A self-described player, whose rig they claimed had been totaled by the game, stated bluntly that it contained a Chinese Sandwich. Undeterred by the confusion, I kept at my search, ramming through the archives, pushing my way further back in time, from 1997 to 1995. USENET had been mirrored prior to its collapse yet its content was not indexed completely; a robust query of its posts required force and patience.... In spite of the odds, my effort worked, my persistence located the roots of Blue Beelzebub. It was a posted dated June 15, 1995 written by the games originator, a hacker by the name of ZuZu. According to their missive, they claimed to have produced a proof of concept demo for their latest and greatest game, Blue Beelzebub, and that it was a legit game catering to those who worship and admire Lucifer and everything that stands for. ZuZu listed, point by point, the substance of their creation. I wasnt surprised to see, splattered across that post, the verbiage LVN usurped for their own advert. Except - they werent seeking funding. According to their missive, the game had been bankrolled by entities of a foreign sort, who dont want to be credited. Rather, they were seeking experts willing to alpha &amp; beta test the product. Blue Beelzebub and by extension ZuZu went rouge between 1997 and 2005. Then - October 31, 2005 - ZuZu submitted their last, known public statement. Broadcasted through their usual, over-the-top flamboyance, they wished for their fans to learn and spread the word that they secured an exclusive. They had convinced a devote of indie horror / FPS games to review Blue Beelzebub. The player they had snagged was famous for their day and their name I recognized as I read it. Bobby Mortaren - an internet pioneer par excellence. Mixing reviews and play-throughs together, his format had been lauded as visionary and just as imitated. Tweaked a bit by-the-by it continued to find use. His name, though, hadnt been spoken of for a decade. Games had changed. Tastes had changed. He could have shifted into yet another venture so far as I knew. Mortaren posted his works to YouTube - to YouTube prior to its merger with Alphabet. As I considered the changes that transpired across the years, I wasnt surprised to discover that all of my links to his works were dead. Eerily, though, it was impossible to locate his reviews directly via YouTube. So I tried Google and Bing. No result. Ditto with DuckDuckGo. Ditto with Wiki, SlideShare, BoardReader. Out of desperation I surfed into the remnants of Alta Vista - maybe its database saved the information? No. No. Futile - all of it. YouTubes size was greater than USENETs size. My tasks extent was altogether a colossal order of magnitude. If that which I pursued had not been deleted, then, it would be found ad finem omnia. So to dig further I opted for a quick &amp; dirty hack - a bot. A bot scripted to sift and sort all YouTubes content that matched keywords Mortaren and Blue Beelzebub. I ran it and waited for days then for weeks then for months. \### My extensive search corroborated the fact that Mortaren left the internet c. 200. Assuming they may have continued via pseudonym, I enquired into the matter with colleagues who devoted themselves to games and / or to reviews. Only a few recognized their name; nobody was cognizant of their voice. An editor from ToplessRobot directed my attention to a defunct fansites messageboard where somebody asked why Mortaren vanished without a trace. To my shock, the reply was that Mortaren had been arrested by the FBI c. 2006. I could not fathom why. Nevertheless, if the revelation were correct, then, the resolution to the matter was tantalizingly viable. Arrests - and trials - were public. The LVN / EU case brought my forensic skills to the notice of the DOJ and the Treasury / Secret Service. The FBI, like its European counterparts, wanted to understand everything about bitcoin and how it might (might) be possible to trace transactions to individuals. As part of my freelance work, I already met and debriefed FBI agents re: the Czech hacker. Eventually large talk gave way to small talk amongst us. It was at that juncture that I broached the subject of Blue Beelzebub - namely, that LVN hatched a scheme to defraud investors (via bitcoin) ostensibly by promising to develop an update to that game. They got exposed by players who recognized the games ill-repute, I stated. Apparently, the games infamy started after its reviewer, a fellow by the name of - er - Robby Mortaren? Bobby Mortaren? Well - they got arrested by the FBI. Neither the game nor the reviewer elicited a reply - immediately, anyhow. A (censored) document, summarizing a DOJ investigation, worked its way into my mailbox. Mortaren had been under FBI surveillance from November 2005 to May 2006. Why wasnt stated; just that the FBI obtained search warrants for computers &amp; electronics. A federal judge issued an arrest warrant May 30, 2006; however, the DOJ withdrew the charges after Mortaren agreed to an immunity deal. Mortaren turned star witness at a trial that involved organized crime as well as rackets, cults, ritualized human &amp; civil rights abuses and elements that suggested Satanism. The perpetrator(s) that the DOJ wanted to convict fled either to South America OR Eastern Europe / Central Asia. The trial evaporated; neither the charges nor the perpetrator(s) were detailed. Mortarens immunity deal with the DOJ wasnt negotiable or retractable and included a complete internet ban. The document listed a PO BOX as Mortarens permanent address. &gt;To Mr. B. Mortaren: &gt; &gt;Sir, I apologize. Blue Beelzebub. Were it not for the fact that you may be the only person left to recall that game, I would not have stretched my resources so thin to find you. If you are not able to assist my research, is anyone? &gt; &gt;I was part of an EU investigation re: bitcoin, theft &amp; fraud, as well as trafficking &amp; exploiting vagrants. Through that investigation I came into contact with a hacker; they claimed to be working on Blue Beelzebub; they sought funds to upgrade it. While disturbing to say the least, that game did not strike me as part of the hackers MO. So I pried further into the matter and discovered, to my astonishment, that Blue Beelzebub dated to the mid 90s and that you reviewed &amp; posted the demo at YouTube. &gt; &gt;I am curious about that game. I cannot get it out of my head. Who was the programmer? Who was the developer? Where did they get the money? What were their goals? What was the game about, if the game was about anything? &gt; &gt;A DOJ document summarizing your immunity from prosecution was brought to my attention. I suspected, as I matched the timeframe of the FBIs surveillance and arrest, to the demo, that these matters are related. I was not able to find a link, due to the fact that all records, transcripts, etc., were sealed by request of the FBI. &gt; &gt;If, for any reason what so ever, we cannot communicate about this matter, would it be possible to contact a surrogate or anybody with the information I seek? &gt; &gt;With All Due Respect &gt; &gt;JK \### Due to limits that existed at YouTubes debut, videos posted from 2005 to 2010 were capped to 10 minutes. Both image and sound playback quality were kept low to spare bandwidth. A lack of (accessible) software and hardware to edit video forced vloggers to improvise. Mortaren had always used a webcam and mic from the 90s to shot their videos live, i.e., without edits. YouTube retained the majority of Mortarens content; however, after a check of the dates and the posters IDs, I determined that Mortarens videos had been reposted c. 2006 by another user. If the titles / numbers were correct then there were seven parts to the demo Mortaren recorded for Blue Beelzebub. Of seven, six remained. Specifically, the 5ifth - which must have been filmed as evidenced by the discontinuity between 4ourth and 6ixth - defied my ability to trace. The reposter stated that the 5ifth wasnt part of the review package. Yet, as I perused copies of replies they had saved, commentary that referenced material that doesnt appear anywhere else, I strongly suspected that a 5ifth had been posted for a while and, for whatever reason, Mortaren removed it prior to 2006. **1irst - details facts re: the game: the developer, the programmer, the system requirements, etc.** If your rigs able to run DOOM, Blue Beelzebub works, they state then add: although, prepare yourselves, kiddos, the game takes a very, very long time to install. Passingly, he adds that a fan of his had ditched the game after they experienced a catastrophic system failure that they blamed on either a bug or a virus or both. The executable and its auxiliary files pass every virus and malware checker Mortaren throws at it. **2econd &amp; 3hird - demonstrates the game play or what passes for it.** Mortaren prefers to record his reviews live so that his fans experience the game exactly as he does. His videos contain hints / cheats if they are discovered as he plays. He describes Blue Beelzebub as a DOOM-GUY-ESQUE player who moves through an enshadowed monochromatic maze. Theres no backwards, I, I, I dont believe it! Did they forget to give us backwards? Theres forwards and left, right. Kiddos, you gotta do a circle to go backwards. He continues to berate the game, adding: Yeah, theres only forwards. And you know, I gotta say it, the programmer may think theyre the moneys nuts for it.... But its so weird that going forwards causes the view to bob up and down or side to side. Whatre they trying to do? Are they trying to replicate a players gait? Takes me right out of the game. Let me tell yall why. Like I said, the programmers got to be thinking theyre the monkeys nuts but its that bizarro attention to detail thats so jarring as I consider the lack of detail given to the graphics. Guys. Guys. Guys. You gotta think about what you present. Mortaren piles his criticism of the graphics and the sounds, comparing both unfavorably to DOOM. Especially frustrating is the invariance of the black &amp; white textures throughout the maze. He praises the response of the maze to the player as he notes, while attempting to draw the maze, that its passages shift at random. Then more and more criticisms were strewn at the game, including its lack of weaponry, its lack of powerups / extras, its lack of anything. A game cant be about going through the maze, guys, theres got to be a point - something to do! Finally, he voices the suspicion that he had been duped by ZuZu. **4ourth - the demo gets interesting.** Mortaren finds an area of the maze where the textures differ. The videos pixilation - perhaps due to the webcam - perhaps due to the way the reposter preserved it - masks the bulk of the alteration. I detect a change of shade, though, from black &amp; white to blue. Well it cant be for nothing that the wall is blue. Jeez! As he cracks the joke, to his shock (an explicative slips), the sounds became those of eerie, drone-like notes fading into reverb and the monitor displays a still-shot. Mortaren zooms into the image; I recognize it as coming from the shock-site, ROTTEN. After that alteration, every blue-hued texture Mortaren faces produces other images, increasingly nihilistic and graphic, usually of the dead or the dying, often of celebrities, suicides, accidents, wrecks. **5ifth - ?** **6ixth - the segment starts at an awkward jump.** It must have been split from the 5ifth video and while Mortaren does not state why, explicitly, the tone of the voice suggests that something serious transpired. Sorry, kiddos, I turned the webcam away - a first - I guess this ZuZu accomplished something. When he returns the webcam to the monitor, it is apparent that in addition to tone the substance of the game itself altered. The player stands at the center of a room Mortaren describes as a vault with a hole at its floor. The 2.5D renderer prevents the player from gazing inside the hole. But by directing the player to walk the holes circumference it is possible to catch bits of its contents. A sharp, blue light shoots out of the hole; the way it cast light at the ceiling suggests there might have been water, as if the hole were a well of sorts. What shocks Mortaren is that the room fills with children. The renderings of faces make each of the children unique. However: the ghastliness of the imagery resembles how faces voxilate like with Delta Force games. Further, he notes, after a pause that echoes my own consternation and trepidation, Ive seen these kids. Yeah, Ive seen these kids from those, those photographs the game stopped everything to show us. Jeez! The children stand statue-like as the player walks about them. They serve as obstacles that block movement, otherwise, inert, unresponsive, not that the player interacts with the kids as theres no other keys available except A, W, D. The video continues, then, Mortaren shrieks. The playback jostles as if it were about to stop. When everything resettles, he speaks, calmly and evenly, that theres a kid thats different ... animated. You gotta see it, kiddos, I cant say if its awful because its awful or if its awful because its awful.... The webcam zooms into the monitor; the child rendering appears to show it breathing, haphazardly, with their mouth agape. And then, then the child moves and the player like the viewer alike slip an explicative. I take it back, everything, this is truly and utterly awful. **7eventh - the coda feels like the sets longest but is the shortest.** Right now Im running. I dont have a weapon, jeez! Im running as fast as this keyboard allows but my health is shrinking. Mortaren stops and rotates the player to face backwards. The animated child is behind and striking the player using a technique that resembles Hanna-Barbera laziness - or who knows - who knows, kiddos, it could be part of the style. Just as it is with DOOM, as the players health decreases, the view gets redder and the avatar gets bloodier. Mortaren aims into the maze; there is no exit, there is no weapon, no upgrade to assist, all that exists is the floor where the player drops, dead. The 7eventh adds a post-script recorded after the demo. It shows Mortarens PC, open and split to pieces. The game installed a virus, he declared then described its symptoms. Immediately upon my players death, the PC rebooted. After the BIOS, instead of going into DOS, it starts a telnet session and tries to connect via IP. Of course it doesnt get a reply since my PC uses dial-up. So it freezes, pinging and pinging a server somewhere that it cannot reach. Mortaren concludes by theorizing that if Blue Beelzebub were a virus, it must have been designed to target high-end systems with LAN / Ethernet ports. I jot the IP and attempt to connect to it. Strangely, it will not load yet it will not issue an error of any kind. Chrome, FireFox, Edge, etc., freeze. WHOIS is not able to resolve the owner. Nevertheless, it yields the location of the server, a site approximately 50 miles north east of Trinidad, Colorado. I reject the result; users of tracers already know that they rely on ISP databases to match IP / location - and how often are those databases updated? - and how often are those updates distributed? The decade that passed between today and the video, and between the video and the creation, assures that there must have been a drift re: the location of the IP. \### I will not reveal the particulars of when, where, and how I received the call. The coordinates. Into my ear spoke a voice that my investigation made familiar. Check the coordinates. Coordinates? Blue Beelzebub. Yes, I replied and Mortaren implied wed meet. Mortaren had traced my whereabouts through the blogosphere. He wanted to talk about the game yet feared the government and or others eavesdropping. I admitted off-handedly that as I sunk into my work with the DOJ, my paranoia tipped. Whats the deal with the game, anyway? What do you want on your Chinese Sandwich? My impression settled onto a mixture of intrigue and trepidation. The matter felt so cryptic as to defy credulity. Coordinates? Blue Beelzebub. Chinese Sandwich? Nevertheless, even as we talked (brief as the conversation was) I put together that by coordinates + Blue Beelzebub Mortaren referred to the IP the game telneted."
12,cyber-crime,nosleep,Seoul: The Message,1,9pchcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9pchcx/seoul_the_message/,2018-10-19 06:34:16,"Jin Byong Song hated October. There was something about the electric city of Seoul that propagated the infectious and diseased scum to scrape themselves from the underbelly, during this time of year. Rapes were up 30%. Homicide files stacked on every desk. And what he liked to call ""the ghost files"" were simply stored in a cabinet that will never see an overworked, smoke spewing, detective, pouring over them. Those pages that were stuck between the crisp manila folders will be as uncracked as the spine of a text book belonging to some unnamed future-drop out in a chair, whose green chalkboard writes REMEDIAL MATH in large, white capitalized letters. The ghost files, cold cases without a name. Extraterrestrial sightings. The Slit Mouthed Woman. Shadow People. Most recently Lizard People, due to a popular rise in a global communications mogul whose faceless expressions during a privacy nomenclature with the United States Supreme court has drawn controversy and infamy on the world wide web. &amp;#x200B; A tall, lanky man with slick black hair, rolled with grease, broke Jin out of his deep stare at the storage cabinet near the coffee machine. Mung threw a file onto Jin's desk and then drummed his fingers on the edge, ""Did you see what we've got there?"" Mung noticed Jin staring at the unsolved case files, ""Hey, part, partner. I need you up here buddy. There's some current problems we need to tackle first."" Jin turned to look at the file on his desk. He had already flipped through it earlier, ""Do you think it'll lead to another epidemic?"" Mung sucked in air through his teeth and then sighed, ""Well, you know. The human mind is fragile. One moment we're leading the pack across the Nakdong river, then next thing you know - we're searching for an answer."" He leaned against the desk, ""I tell you what though. Five years ago if you told me we'd be battling some cyber crime, I wouldn't believe it. Cyber crime? I'd tell you it was a joke. Next thing I'm scraping students packs off the floor. Some kid that offed himself because he lost a game, killing himself out of shame. Can you believe that? To kill yourself out of shame. I mean, what has this generation become?"" Mung scratched at the shadow on his chin, it bristled from his jaw and into his ear as white noise. Its somehow always helped him to think. ""I suppose we're going to have to nab this little twit - that put it up in the first place. Endangerment to the community, a blight on public servers. Probably his lawyer will double down on the idea of artistic development or some other bull shit. Who knows. Everyone might just be scrubbed clean for this crime."" He paused, ""What do you think Jin?"" ""I know that it creates death. And whoever it is, should at least be made aware of it. Maybe even a slap on the wrist. Just to show what they've done and how it affects others."" Mung smiled at him weirdly, before breaking out into a full laugh, ""You've always been such a commie,"" he said. ""I just think if we're more aware of things, then we'll do things more differently. Heck, it's worked out for Japan alright."" ""I take it back, you're worse than a commie. You're a damned Jap-lover,"" Mung joked. ""Did someone say Jap-lover,"" a young officer poking his head above his cubicle asked. ""Shut-up Ikki,"" Mung told the newcomer. ""Yes sir!"" the young officer replied with a sheepish grin. The two detectives chuckled half hardily as the young man disappeared back underneath his cubicle, hat and all. And as the smiles smoothed on their faces, a seriousness blanketed their conversation, steadying their words, ""Have you read it yet,"" Mung asked. Jin nodded, ""Have you?"" ""Not yet. Ryouga just pushed it on me as I walked in. Said something about 3 confirmed suicides already. I can't believe it. Was our generation always this impressionable?"" ""Two of the three deaths are from a 32 year old male and a 44 year old woman."" ""What about the third,"" Mung asked. ""She was sixteen."" ""Shit,"" Mung breathed. ""God. Shit. She was just a kid."" Jin pulled up the file on his computer, ""You should really take a look."" Mung shook the words from his mouth, ""Yeah, yeah. I think you're right.""

Since writing the first part to my story I felt a little bit of relief being able to open up with my experience with my neighbor. I have received a lot of feedback and questions which was great to receive. Tonight I want to welcome you to the second chapter in my series Is My Neighbor A Murder? before reading part two be sure to go back and read part one so that you can see of the events unfolded. Part One: [URL A few weeks have passed now since the night that my neighbor came into our home while my parents were gone for the weekend. Since then he and I have exchanged looks each time we see one another in passing. I still have nightmares about that night and now thanks to my dad my neighbor knows that I was home, hiding in the closet as he was intruding in our home. What makes it worse is that he also probably knows I saw him in his backyard that night digging up something, or possibly burying something, or someone. Every night since I look out my window after dark expecting to see something that would help everything make sense. Maybe I am just overreacting and that my neighbor was just doing some late night gardening or something. Maybe the noise I heard that night was someone else in our backyard and maybe he really was just checking on me. All I know for sure is that I need to figure this all out so I can stop sleeping with one eye open. Almost a month has passed now. My parents decide that its okay to leave the house again on weekends. They suggest though that I come with them for the weekend because they dont trust me on my own just yet. I know that there is no winning this argument so I decide to go with the flow and pack my bag for a weekend at the cottage. There isnt any cell service there either so it would be a perfect distraction-free weekend from technology. We pack out bags and load them into the family car and head to the cottage for the weekend. On Sunday when we returned home I was exhausted. I wanted nothing more than to finally shower and then complete my Sunday ritual. My ritual consisted of finishing my homework, watch a movie, and the head to bed. I walk over to my desk and turn on my computer to see what I missed in the cyber world over the weekend. My news feed was filled with normal things. Pictures of the cool kids drinking at some house party, break up post with so and so accusing the other person of cheating, and lastly new relationship status, my favorite. I was caught up on everything in no time. I turned my computer off and decided that it was time to complete my homework. When I looked at my desk I noticed that something was out of place. Matter of fact, not only was it out of place it was gone. My journal had been laying there on the corner of my desk when I had left Friday. I know this because my journal is always on the corner of my desk, its been there that long that there is a dust outline on my desk proving I wasnt crazy. I went downstairs and asked my parents if they had seen my journal. Both of them looked puzzled and swore they never touched it. I told them that it was there when we had left for the cottage on Friday. They told me that maybe I just misplaced it somewhere around the house, it was bound to turn up somewhere. I headed back to my room pissed off that someone had been going through my stuff. My parents dont understand the significance of my missing journal. I write everything down in there. I tried to think back to the last time I wrote in it, then I remembered writing in it the night before we left for the weekend. I was in my bed late writing in it, I remember this specifically because it was around the same time our neighbor had the bright idea to cut his grass at one in the morning like some deranged lunatic. Thats when it crossed my mind, what if he came back into our house? At this point, I was determined to find my journal. I was convinced that my neighbor had to have taken it. The only problem was that I am too afraid to confront him about it. I dont want to make him anymore more suspicious of me and if I flat out accused him of taking my journal he would know for sure that I am on to him. I came to the conclusion that I had to go into his house and look for it. I know it sounded crazy but if he can come up with a far excuse as to why he came into our home, I am sure I can come up with something if I get caught. Technically It's not breaking in if the doors aren't locked, is it? For the remainder of the afternoon, I stood there in my parent's window waiting for the opportunity to present itself. After what felt like hours I see him come out of his home and walk towards his car. I watch as he pulls out onto the street and drives off down the road. Soon as his tail lights were out I sight, I knew it was my time to act. I look around the house before leaving and notice that my parents are in the family room watching television. I quietly went out our back patio door and headed towards our neighbors house. I go to his back patio door and luckily for me it slides open easily. I know that he doesnt have any pets and I listen for a moment and I determine that he doesnt have any alarm. I knew that I had to move quickly. I check the main level first. I walk into his living room first, when I go in the first thing I notice is how bare it is. He doesnt have a television, just a wall full of books and a record player on a shelf. I scan the bookshelf for my journal and I realize it isnt there. I knew it couldnt have been this easy. I headed upstairs and fortunately for me the house isnt that big so I am able to go in and out of rooms rather quickly. At this point when I reach one of the bedrooms, my heart is beating out of my chest. I havent committed a crime before and I start to think that maybe this wasnt such a good idea. If I did get caught there was nothing I could come up with that would get me out of this situation. The room I was standing in must be his, its the only room in the house that looks lived in. As I was standing there looking around I noticed that his bedroom window faces my parents bedroom window, he can see into the room perfectly. I started to think back to that night I was home alone, I wonder did he see me there standing in my parents window? Did he know that I was home alone the entire time?. I felt so vulnerable now and then I think to myself, what would he have done to me if he found me that night? Would I have ended up in the hole he was digging in the cover of darkness? I regain focus and remember that I am on a mission to find my journal. I look around his room again and thats when I see it there hidden under the newspapers on the nightstand. I grabbed it and made my way downstairs. As I am leaving through the back patio door I hear his car pull into the drive. The timing couldnt have been anymore impeccable. I wait for him to go through his front door so that I can hop the fence back into the safety of my yard. Im standing there around the corner of his house only feet away from him. I quickly realized that there were two voices, not just his. I could pick out the voice of my neighbor, but the second voice I heard I never recognized. After listening for a bit longer I realized that the voice was the voice of a female. I heard my neighbor ask her if she wanted to see his backyard garden, I knew I was in shit. I heard their footsteps growing louder and closer to the backyard. I was trapped with nowhere to go but back into the house. I slid the door open quietly and squeezed back into the kitchen. I closed the door behind me with not a second to spare. Soon as the door was closed I could see my neighbor and his female friend through the glass. She was a young brunette who looked to be in her early forties. I assumed that they were on a date which was odd because I never have seen him with a female friend before. The conversation about his garden seemed to have hit a roadblock. He talked about his flowers for way too long. I sort of felt bad for him because even at this distance I could tell he had no social skills. When the conversation finally died I saw them both heading towards the patio door. I walked to the front door and when I got to it I realized that it wouldnt open. It seemed that the knob was broken, it just kept turning but it failed to open. I had to think quick because in a few seconds I would be in a tough situation to lie my way out of. I moved into the living room and slid open one of the windows. It was old and never moved well but I managed to get it open just enough for me to slip out off. Soon as I hit the ground I felt someone move in the room behind me. I stayed low underneath the window and I could hear him above my head breathing heavily. I could tell that he was angry and due to the silence I knew he never saw me right underneath his nose, he was too busy scanning the streets for a sign of movement. The window above me slammed shut. I could hear him walking out of the room and when I heard him talking to his female friend I did my best army crawl towards my house. When I was close enough I got onto my two feet and made a dart for the front door to our home. Soon as I got inside the safety of my home I fell to the floor. I thought for sure I was going to get caught. My mother came walking out of the living room and noticed me collapsed on the floor. This never struck her as odd. I was expecting for her to ask why I was as white as a ghost, but all she said was I see you found your journal, told you it would turn up I was finally back inside my bedroom with my journal in hand. I went through the pages to see what or if anything was missing. Right away I noticed that the entries I made near the back of the book were torn out. This made sense because they were the pages about that night. They were the pages where I wrote about my suspicions about him. I paused in fear knowing that he is now aware that I suspect hes up to something. He probably even suspects it was me inside his house today. All I can ask myself is, what do I do? That night before I go to bed I go around to all the doors and windows and lock them. My parents find it odd since we dont normally lock our doors. They agreed that if it would help me sleep better they would even activate the alarm system that we never used before. That night Im in my bed fast asleep. I hear something outside and I jerk up in my bed. When I come to my senses I realized that the sound wasnt coming from outside. It was coming from my neighbor's house. When I realized what I was hearing that sick feeling in the pit of my stomach came back. The sound I was hearing was someone screaming at the top of their lungs, what was more gut-wrenching is it was a female. I jumped out off bed and reach for my cell phone on my computer desk. I dialed three numbers. # 9-1-1 what's your emergency? To be continued..."
14,cyber-crime,nosleep,"I thought I was just busting a drug dealer, then I found these files",39,85wa1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/85wa1m/i_thought_i_was_just_busting_a_drug_dealer_then_i/,2018-03-21 07:52:50,"Who likes police procedurals? You? Well, it's not all chasing suspects in the streets any more. So much crime has moved online. That's where I come in. Just a low level cop, but young and tech savvy, so I was placed in the cybercrime department. I look at the Dark Web all day for a living. I see the worst of the worst, and pass on any information I can glean from it, so that police can track down identity thieves and online dealers. Sometimes traffickers or those disgusting people who make snuff videos, but mostly just people trying to make an (illegal) buck. It's actually pretty boring. Until today. I've been trying to nail a guy who sells pharmaceuticals and medical supplies. I actually feel a bit bad for him, since I remember taking veterinary antibiotics as a kid when my family didn't have health insurance. To prove it, I've had to hack into his computer. So, there I was, clicking through his price and supply lists, the occasional porn video, and so on, for his personal information. Then I came across a folder labeled ""5135188514325 229451519,"" full of video files with similar file names. The metadata was stripped, but all the files were named with a similar schema. The first I viewed was ""111205 16512209518"". My first thought was this was sex trafficking and these were ""ad"" videos for victims. But something wasn't right. The video showed one female, a teenager, but there was someone else in the room. The camera was just slightly unsteady, so I could tell it wasn't a camera on a tripod. The camera had showed her whole body, then zoomed in to show her from the shoulders up. Recognition burned through me. That girl was missing, had been for about two years now! I remembered her face because she had been from my hometown. Her name was Kate something. The police there hadn't looked long. Most teenagers are assumed to run away, not go missing, and she...even at barely 15, had had reason to. Her family hadn't done the horrible kinds of things I sometimes had to see through my screen, but they...ignored. Didn't seem to have the time of day for her. It was her grandmother that reported Kate missing after three days, and pursued the case. Apparently, it was Kate's peers that were awful. Push her down the stairs, steal her books, shove her tiny frame into lockers. Dyke bitch. Nobody. Faggot. Carpet muncher. Worthless. Kate was a bit taller now, though still tiny for her...she'd be what, 17, now? She was still small, but had packed on muscle, and held her head high. I forced myself back into cyber-analyst mode. Checked her face against an age progressed photo. Perfect match. Kate was standing against a bare concrete wall, and in the background I glimpsed the corner of something painted above her head level, something red, maybe a cross. I heard distant screams throughout the short clip. Not fear, though. Pain. There was no natural light in the video, and what light there was was harsh, making her look washed out. She seemed nervous, and her gaze kept shifting as she began speaking, but her voice was clear. ""If you're seeing this, something's gone wrong. I may need help."" She sighed. ""Anyway, my name is Hannah Michaels. My birthday is March 8, 2001."" I paused the video. That didn't sound right. Why would she say she was someone she wasn't, and the birthdate? I checked the information on her case. Her birthday was actually April 30th, 2001. Pressed play. ""I have EU and Swiss residency. Type AB positive. Allergic to penicillin and eggs. I have an anxiety disorder but no other medical conditions. I'm..."" she paused, ""...gay. I speak fluent English, fairly good French, and a bit of Russian. I have a two-inch, narrow scar on my forehead just below the hairline, and pierced ears."" A voice off camera, young and female, said, ""Cut. Let's get the next person's video,"" and ended it there. That was it. All of the videos were like that. Short clips of kids, giving names, dates, medical and identity information. I thought I recognized a few of the kids as other missings, but their birth dates and names didn't match their actual information either. Some of the kids, the older ones, seemed nervous and added disclaimers like Kate had, that something was wrong if these videos were seen, but the younger ones- they went as young as 4, clearly being coached from off camera, but being recorded alone- seemed bouncy and happy, some even bored. The younger elementary aged kids said, ""this is my video project for school."" After viewing the videos, I did what I had done for Kate's, and checked each against age progression photos in the missing database. Every video matched to somebody's child, often children abducted very young. Only three of them, Kate included, had been taken as teenagers. But with no metadata, no windows, and no recognizable background, these videos can't tell anything, forensically. But why are all these kids still alive, some after more than a decade? Where are they? And what's gone wrong? Who could even hold and raise more than 40 children? And why are they acting so strangely?"
15,cyber-crime,nosleep,Succubus,15,729pk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/729pk0/succubus/,2017-09-25 12:47:08,"There had been three of them at that point in time. They were all single men who lived alone. They had all been found in their bed rooms with multiple stab wounds to the jugular vein. The second time that the police aired information regarding the victim, I scoured the victim's social media platforms. He had facebook, instagram, twitter and tumblr accounts. The third victim had all of these accounts as well. I also found him on OkCupid and Squirt. The first victim's accounts had been shut down before I could investigate. They had all been murdered on a Saturday night. There had been no clues on social media. This is where both the police and I had been stumped. Both of the deceased whom I had researched had been intelligent loners who rarely mentioned friends or family members in their posts or comments. There had been a comment to which both men had replied on facebook. There was a meme of a blow up sex doll with the caption The perfect girlfriend to which victim #1 had simply replied, lol. There was a duplicate picture of the sex toy to which victim #2 made a comment. The caption said, Keep Calm and Feel the Glory. Victim two had replied, Simple Simone, haha. Both of the memes had been uploaded by the same person. Simple Simone is the name of a seedy movie arcade on the outskirts of the city. I knew from personal experience. The private porn viewing rooms all had a small opening to the adjacent room or rooms at waist height in the walls. Perverts like me call these portals glory holes. You can have an anonymous encounter with a stranger in the dark and dirty place without actually being in the same room with the other person. Because of this naughty detail, I considered the dead men's comments as inside jokes. I spent my weekend nights stalking the establishment while waiting for any consistent patrons. While surfing facebook one Friday morning, I saw the same blow up doll picture with a new caption - I'm not a high maintenance bitch. There were two comments. The first one said, Will you marry me? Haha! The second person replied,  ;) . I researched both of their profiles immediately. The first responder was a pimply kid who entertained himself by making crude remarks to catfish with fake pics. The second person was a wait-staffer at a high end lunch and dinner restaurant downtown. I followed all of his links and I cyber-stalked him properly. That night as I watched the patrons go in and out of Simple Simone's smut house, I recognized the man who had replied to the meme. A car door opened on the far side of the parking lot and a lady emerged as soon as he entered the establishment. She had short brown hair and a thin frame. I could see freckles peppering her androgynous symmetrical visage. I remember thinking that she was too pretty to be in this shitty dump. Nevertheless, she walked in her knee high Doc's into the building. After she stepped inside, I considered that she may have been watching me watching the door. I parked my car in a different location. I walked out and got their separate license plate numbers. I then drove home to do more avid research. It seems as though all of my hobbies culminated in this circumstance. I have a drone with night vision capabilities. The government had afforded me skills when I had served time in the U.S. Army. The government also awards me with disability checks and a blind eye to my IT side work income. It was Saturday night and the fourth mark's car was parked in front of his apartment complex. I waited until I witnessed her park and walk around the side of the building. She texted into her phone. Minutes later a stairwell door opened and the waiter opened the door with a smile. He looked around cautiously as she entered. He didn't notice me. This is where my inner novice reared it's boyish head. I had twenty minutes power on my drone. What if she stayed all night? What if they immediately went into the bedroom? Were the other marks clothed when they had died? Only the police knew these answers which had not been leaked to the general public. Fuck it. I powered my drone and I flew it up to his balcony. He was sitting on a chair in his dining room. She was giving him a massage. He was smiling as she walked into the kitchen and removed a beer from the refrigerator. She was speaking to him with an easy demeanor. He answered her with closed eyes and happy cheeks. She returned and resumed massaging his neck and shoulders. He seemed satisfied as he gripped her wrist. He leaned back and he slapped her ass. She appeared to laugh and they both sat on the sofa in the living room. They looked into each others' eyes as though they were deeply in love. My drone's power was low. I resigned the task and I flew the drone back to me. Sadly, I drove home. If there was a murder, I reasoned, I would be at the scene of a crime with only evidence that I had been stalking the latest victim. Sunday morning brought news of a new victim. Bachelor #4 had died at the hands of some unknown assailant. Blood loss was the reason. It was the waiter. My thoughts curdled. My mind began to work against me. I liked the waiter. He was a decent dude who had a vanilla sense of humor. His likes were on the side of sentimental. His comments had been inoffensive yet evidenced a hint of mischief. His life had been an open book on the various social media platforms and this catfish had closed his chapters forever. I wrestled with moral dilemmas for two weeks until my curiosity got the better of me. It was a Monday. I drove to Simple Simone's, but this time I exited my vehicle and I went inside. I walked into an empty booth and closed the door behind me. I put a twenty dollar bill into the dock. The pornographic images and sounds filled the cubicle. Some minutes later I heard a knock on the door. I answered, Yeah? A voice answered with a question, Donation? I answered with a question, Benjamins or Jacksons? She said, Cum, Daddy. I answered, Yeah. I heard the door next to mine close. Grunting and moaning resounded from her booth after she put money into the bill dock. I could see her eye through the glory hole. She stuck her tongue through the opening and curled it upward. I stood and eased my erection into the hole. I pressed my hands against the roughly painted particle bord partition. As I remembered her beautiful face, she handled me like a professional. I grunted like a wild animal when I arrived within her mouth. She swallowed greedily. While I zipped and buckled, a rolled up note fell onto the sticky floor of my booth. It read, Be here Friday. Maybe we can date Saturday. I said, Maybe. Another note dropped. It was the blow up doll picture words were written with a sharpie, Objectify Me. FB Succubus1357. Her voice said, Put in twenty more dollars, let time run out and leave after that. I started another movie as her door closed behind her. I put in an additional twenty as I sat in the glow of the screen feeling purely terrified. Would she be in the backseat of my car? Would she be waiting for me at my home? I had officially been rendered paranoid. There was a dilemma that churned in my mind. I knew the facebook code. I knew that she would return on Friday, but I sure as Hell was not planning to willingly see that psychopath again. At the end of the week her meme was posted. It was the open mouthed blow up doll which had the caption, Objectify Me. I did not respond. I stayed at home as I considered that I may be saving someone's life on the next evening. I tinkered with my drone and I ran personal errands in order to keep my mind occupied that Saturday. On Sunday morning there was no news flash about a murder fitting the young lady's method of operation. I resumed side work as a tech during my days. At night, I abstained from visiting Simple Simone's. A year has gone by and I have seen no notices of a victim #5. I could give the police an anonymous tip. I could make a heroic gesture and show my creeper drone video to the authorities. I can do neither of those things, however, because victim #3 should have been her last. Now I have to live my life aware that I was her silent accomplice . I now live as a recluse. I am afraid of glory holes, anonymous encounters and every bump that I hear in the night. She may not have killed me, but she has drained my joy of living in its entirety. "
16,cyber-crime,nosleep,FreeVidChat!,256,6lgy2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6lgy2l/freevidchat/,2017-07-06 07:00:57,"I work in the wide, wonderful, and worrisome world of online porn. I hope you'll forgive me for being blunt with this bit; but it is important to my story that I get it out of the way first. If this discussion is not the type for you, I would apologize foremost, and kindly suggest you exit in the way which you came. I do promise, however, that if you are willing; the punch is well worth the wait. That was a joke, Mom. ---------------- My office might be a bit different from yours, considering it sits about four feet away from my four post bed in a cramped alcove of my bedroom. I live in a city, the location of which doesn't seem necessary. If you were to look at a postcard of this city, my building would be one of many nestled into the backdrop of the not-too distant horizon. If you had a magnifying glass, you might even be able to see it clearly from the others. I am on the eighth floor - one of thousands of perfectly symmetrical 8x10 windows in neat rows. After living here a while, it's hard not to think of yourself this way; just another ant crawling up and down the hill, praying you are not the one to get stomped. In that little alcove near my bed, I store all the tools needed for my job. There's a reclining chair, and a nice oak desk, and I also keep some other work items in the hutch drawer. The blinds cover my 8x10 window at all times, so I have some artificial Smart Lights in different colors decorating my messy bedroom and stained white walls. There's also a shade disguising my bed, for extra flair. Nevertheless, my horror story began Sunday. In my industry, to say that you *meet a lot of creeps* would be a gross understatement. We live and die by the creeps. Whether you support my life choices at the moment or not, these creeps pay for my groceries and bills. Without them I would be hapless and cramped into my mother's one bedroom boat-house, or on the street with the few friends I have left. Therefore, it is my job to swim the creeps' creepy e-water and siphon them of the few tokens verified by credit cards they managed to nick from their parents' purses, or wherever else. Sounds awful, does it not? A bit judgmental? Unfortunately, you will find anymore sympathy for the consumer here. When my 'career' began, I might have had a little more faith in my customers. Now I am so terrified that writing this, to you, is the only relief that I can fathom. I began Sunday morning in my alcove, reading through the news with a coffee and some Lou Reed. My laptop was propped on the desk documenting the whole thing, as has become custom. My chat was completely empty at the time, save for the usual spam bot advertising her own 'free' chat. Still, my particular corner of the Internet block happens to be one of the most popular. If you're the lucky customer who happens to type ""Free Cams"" or the like into your favorite search engine, you will likely see my employer in the top five. Business always picked up at some point later in the day, but we did get a few usual early birds. Sometime after 11 AM, I was a bit frustrated to find that still, no one had joined. As I got older, this became more common. Even still, I have never been the top (or bottom, I hope) pick of the litter. Some of the other models looked like they had been borne right into a photo-shoot. As the stereotypical runts, some of us have to fight for our fame. In some cases, that included creeping through the 'active' registered users online with the tasty tokens needed for payday. I shamelessly employed this tactic Sunday morning, targeting a likely coveted TJX1000. TJ had thousands of tokens. Folks with that kind of money were almost always regulars, but I did not remember seeing him in the user log any time before. So when I sent him a direct message, I was sure that I was one of tens of models who had already tried to grab his attention. Even still, a big fish was worth the work. I dialed up my go to pick up line and dropped my e-line down the well. **MyUser**: *Hey there, how are you feeling today? ;)* Before I could minimize the window and move on to another, the friendly bloop of a reply filled the room. **TJX1000**: *I was waiting for you to message me.* If hindsight were twenty-twenty, I would claim that this reply threw me a bit. The unfortunate truth is that it did not - I have and continued to see far worse. In fact, I was excited to see TJ was interested in the first place. My fingers thudded against the keyboard anxiously, my excitement visible to the camera. Before I finished my reply, the friendly bloop echoed in my channel once again. **TJX1000** has joined the room. I hit enter to finish my response. **MyUser**: *Well, I did not know if you would be interested in someone like me ;)* My comment was a tug of the line. I had hooked the fish by pulling it into my channel, but if I yanked too quickly I could pull the bait from his mouth altogether. This way, the lock was set just right. It was now up to the fish whether it wanted to bite down or balk. I waited and smiled, posing. This was not unusual. A buyer surveys the product before purchase. Finally; **TJX1000**: *I wouldn't be here if I didn't.* The fish nibbled. **MyUser**: *Tell me how I can help you, baby.* **TJX1000**: *Don't call me baby. Call me baby again and I'll drag you outside like the animal that you are. Would a baby have access to a fucking Mastercard?* I didn't flinch, offering a cute pout to the camera in reply as I typed away. Once again, this type of language wasn't unusual. **MyUser**: *Well now, if you're going to be rude, I can boot you from the channel. But I don't want to do that if you're...* Before I could finish my reply, my company issued buzzer vibrated through the hutch drawer. **TJX1000 has tipped you 25 credits**. I relaxed; stupidly, and gave the camera my best fake grin. **MyUser**: *I think I know how I can help you. Let's go private.* **TJX1000 has invited you to a Private Chat.** I was reeling in now, so I thought. Private Chats charged an absurd 25 tokens a minute - and a small fifteen-percent chunk of that went to the models directly. The one drawback of Private Chat, however, is peer-to-peer video chat. Which, for what it is worth, I will never understand. The user is coming to my employer directly to see the models, but we do not necessarily need to see the customer. Some people like to have some sort of eye to eye consent that could be either psychological or erotic, which I understand. But why have it by default? Nevertheless, judgement is not in the job description. The moment I joined, I heard the crackly static of a radio echo through my speakers. TJ was on video chat, but his monitor was black. Again, not unusual. What was unusual was the song that cackled through his microphone. It took me a moment to realize, but it was the exact same one I was listening to on video. At the exact same part. In surprising unison with my thoughts, TJ spoke in the peer-to-peer chat. **TJX1000**: *I'm sorry I was mean my love. Do you like the song?* **TJX1000**: *Listen to the words.* He played it again, start to finish. I sat silent for the full two and a half minutes thinking I'd just made the simplest $10 of my life. The words were simple, old ones I'd always known and shouted at concerts for years. **TJX1000**: *What a life it would be, if you would come to mine for tea...* I smiled. But after a slow morning, small talk had lost appeal. **MyUser**: *What would you do to me, if I did?* The keyboard on the other side of the video rattled angrily in rhythm with a low grunt. The monitor was still black. **TJX1000**: *Don't fucking talk like that bitch, I told you once.* I hesitated. **MyUser**: *Okay, I am very sorry for that.* **MyUser**: *I can be stupid sometimes. Maybe I need some punishment.* He paused again. I heard the shuffling of feet in the background and a chuckle. **MyUser**: *Is someone with you?* **TJX1000**: *Yes, he's here to fulfill that punishment, Jamie.* Jamie is my real name. I caught my breath as my speakers screeched with feedback. This time, I heard the breaking of glass and a gut wrenching scream. Without warning, a piece of paper was pulled from the video camera. The darkness was replaced by the color red, and it was everywhere. Blood was gushing from a pair of very, very red wrists. I screamed and cut the feed. The first thing I did was call my manager. Paco, as he asked us to call him, was a stubby little Portugese man in his late forties. Corporate considered Paco to be the point contact between talent and themselves, and for all his insecurities he certainly tried to act the part. He wore the same khaki button up shirt, sans top buttom, in any video session I'd had with him, and his slicked black hair was always gelled and sprayed to the thinnest intertwined angle. I knew a few models who had *after-hour*sessions with Paco, but that was left designated to the hush-hush for fear of reprisal. The little guy did have *some* power, after all. The procedure itself is not an unusual one  I wasn't the first model to see something they should not on vidchat, and I won't be the last. It works the same each time, we call Paco; Paco blocks the IP and reports it to the cyber-crimes division we have on speed dial. Every incident we've encountered has started and began there. So on Tuesday morning, when I sat in front of my webcam with a bagel (fuck it) and a coffee, TJX1000 was one thousand miles from my mind. In fact, I already had my sights set on another fish who had just paid my phone bill. But we were interrupted by a new user slightly after eleven. **232315Main has joined the chat.** As in, my home address. I froze in place. Users pinged the room anxiously awaiting my replies, but I could not move. It was something that should be impossible... and with that long an address, was in no way coincidental. I was speechless. After a moment of gaping, I heard the friendly bloop of Instant-Message chat. **232315Main**: *I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go.* I fumbled for my phone off camera, dropping it to the floor like a fool before i pushed the speaker button and muted the mic on my computer. I dialed Paco and the phone rang for what felt like an eternity. **232315Main**: *""I'll pick you up at half past three, and we'll have lasagna.""* Paco finally answered in a half mumbled hello. Paco, please he's back. Block the IP. Block the *fucking IP* Paco! I shouted into the phone. He coughed and asked who. I caught my breath, realizing I was still on vidchat for TJ and everyone else's display. I calmly explained to Paco that the exact same psycho from Sunday was in my channel with a username that was my address. I heard the zip of pants, and Paco mumbled again that he needed to get to his computer. **232315Main has invited you to his video share at the rate of 25 credits per minute**. Fucking auto-agree Paco, block the *fucking feed for TJ!!* The camera or the lights behind it flicked briefly, and within a moment a gagged older man was standing in front of the camera with a knife to his neck. His hands and wrists were covered by what looked to be cotton stuffing from the inside of a pillow. Before I could even force out a scream, the knife ran across his neck and opened it like a cut seam. Paco filled in my breathlessness with a high pitched scream of his own. He was watching on his machine. After what felt like a minute of watching the man die, the IP was blocked and the video cut out. **232315Main has left the chat.** Paco what the fuck is happening? He mumbled frantically that he didn't know, pounding away on his keyboard as he dropped his phone and spoke to the police on speaker. **1271990 has joined the chat** Paco... my birthday... Paco... MOTHERFUCK PACO. **1227990 has left the chat** He screamed that he was trying. Police were on their way. He banned the IPs for every user that joined my channel, but more kept coming. **Digsy has joined the chat**. **Digsy has left the chat**. **JamieIFoundYou232315 has joined the chat**. **JamieIFoundYou232315 has left the chat** **JamieImComing has joined the chat**. After that user, Paco cut the entire Site. 11:15 AM on Tuesday, FreeVidChat went dark. Sometime after 11:30, I quit my job. Not that it mattered, the site will be down for the foreseeable future pending investigation. Last night, I couldn't stand to sleep at my home former office. So last night I put my pride in the trunk and drove to Mom's, which it killed me to do. I did not have many friends in the city, and her boat-house was just across the bridge and a short drive into suburbia. When I got there, the salty air felt like a rush of queasy memories. She ridiculed me about not helping and visiting her as usual, so I made up a story about a surprise visit from the exterminators. In the end, I felt safe rocking back and forth on top of the waves, underneath the roof of a different address and boatyard security system. And I think every person feels a bit safer with their mom sleeping next to them. In the morning, I left for the city feeling rejuvenated, with a plan to clear out my stuff from the apartment and start over somewhere else. When I climbed the steps all the way to the eighth floor I felt more clean that I had in months. So when I went inside my apartment, I didn't see the specks of blood on the door handle, or the slight break in the frame. I must have been in there for an hour, packing up things from my kitchen and living room before I even looked at the work station. If I had, I probably would have seen the knife on my desk, or the note pinned neatly underneath. But it wasn't until later that I picked it up, read it, and saw my mother's home address written in impossibly perfect script. I have called the police, and my former home and former office have become a crime scene in a matter of a week. My Mom took her boat on vacation this morning, and I could not think of a way to tell her what had happened before then. Without any other options, I have decided that I am returning to my apartment tonight, and sleeping there for the temporary future. So Mom, if something happens to me, this explanation is for you. I am telling you now. I love you, and I am sorry for what I did."
17,cyber-crime,nosleep,AGENT MOON,13,5hd1ei,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5hd1ei/agent_moon/,2016-12-09 21:14:10,"AGENT MOON was a code name for a horrific series of events which you won't find recorded in Wikipedia, on account of the fact that reports were necessarily kept out of the press. The events in question occurred almost wholly within the last decade. &amp;nbsp; I doubt the codename will mean anything to ordinary members of the public, like yourself. &amp;nbsp; Perhaps you'll be familiar with other codenames of a more terrestrial nature ; BLARNEY, ECHELON, FAIRVIEW, OAKSTAR, STORMBREW, PRISM. &amp;nbsp; I was on those programs. For over ten years I've worked at the Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia. My name is Private Lance Kelly. &amp;nbsp; Though I now suffer from mild paranoid schizophrenia and occasional psychotics breaks, my psychiatrist says I am improving rapidly. Soon I may be totally independent from the mood stabilisers and permanently released from Bourkekey institution. &amp;nbsp; My past keeps my pride in tow. My employers have included the NSA, the CIA, the AFP and various facets of the military. I've watched you all, (members of the global citizenry), changing your babies diapers, putting lights on your Christmas trees, fucking your mistresses and ejaculating on your girlfriends tits. Yeah, I know, Big brother, George Orwell. Cry me a fucking river. If I told you the Edward Snowden leaks were manufactured, I bet you wouldn't even drop a glass of cold milk in shock. &amp;nbsp; A study in 2011 showed in spite of all the well rehearsed bravado, the average citizen actually feels comforted knowing a Western intelligence agency is spying on them.... Rather than IS or the Chinese. They know that there are worst things in this world than surveillance... I've seen a mighty share of them in my own lifetime. Things a man sees in war changes the meaning of the word horror. But nothing compares to what I learnt during my investigation into the AGENT MOON incidents. &amp;nbsp; Thirteen years ago I was a naive sack of snot like you, and if anyone had of told me I'd be part of a perverse but necessary operation of total global surveillance, i'd probably have laughed, and then shat my pants. That was before I was transferred to Pine Gap. URL &amp;nbsp; I was subordinate to a hard boiled Australian corporal, Reginald D.H Howard. I'd been picked from the military for my astute observation and sharp shooting skills. I thought I could handle a 'no nonsense' environment, but I wasn't in anyway prepared for Pine Gap. We took a urine test every week. Strip searches. Engagement presents melted down, expensive watches and mobile phones smashed, rings melted. Psychological abuse. Insane drills. Solitary confinement. A system perfectly developed and operated out of paranoia. There was physical violence too. In truth, the environment was more like allegations made against factions of Scientology than what you'd expect of the NSA, or the military, and Reginald Howard was my own personal David Miscavage. &amp;nbsp; I took my share of beatings from Howard. But at the end of the day I shut up and I did my god damn job. Protecting the asses of ingratefully molly coddled skeptics like you and your family. Maybe you'll forgive my submissiveness when you understand the precise nature of the case. &amp;nbsp; For me, the incidents (which caused an unprecedented hysteric wave of internal panic and my eventual mental deterioration) started on April 16th 2009. Clearly in official terms they started earlier than this. That was the day when the body of Marina Howard, age 6, was discovered, bound up in a thickly rolled package of aluminium foil, and dumped a kilometre off the base. &amp;nbsp; I won't disclose the full grotesque details of the crime, because no good ear deserves to be spoiled by that abysmal truth, but I'll suffice you the knowledge that the little girl's body was sufficiently mutilated. Part of the invasion had been of a physical, sexual nature. Needless to say the girl suffered. Foil heated the body to a degree that almost cooked the damn thing in the desert sun. &amp;nbsp; Perhaps now, when I tell you that little girl was the daughter of my superior, Reginald Howard, you'll understand my willingness to take more than I should've in the form of physical violence from him, and you won't be surprised to hear that the events affected my day to day life, and work environment on a deeply personal level. The case was handled externally, primarily by the AFP, however American agencies were granted secret jurisdiction on the case, due to their relationship with the base. Early suspicions among my colleagues had flipped from blaming local indigenous groups, to talk of a lone psychopath-- but were expanded in 2010 to the status of 'serial killer' when another body turned up in Alice springs. This time it was an aboriginal girl. &amp;nbsp; She'd been raped and her face was skinned too. Similar MO. But confirmation of a repeat killer only came about when the autopsy report revealed a certain detail. The body of Marina was exhumed, and it was confirmed that there was a crescent moon shaped wound carved into the cranium of both girls. The case seemed to be progressing when Marina's underwear were found in a local river system along with certain identifying clues, which potentially could have vindicated the killer. Me and my colleagues followed the case with cautious fervour, however everything was suddenly shut down on the 5th of March 2010. A hissing and yelling match followed by an eerie silence. &amp;nbsp; I came home with many a busted lip and bruising around the rib cage. Corporal Howard disappeared from duty for over a month, and on returning appeared a changed man, refusing to speak about any details of the case, or his daughter; and he reacted to empathic gestures only with acts of authoritarian violence. All that was known to us on the base, through rumour and speculation was that the case had been linked to an untouchable cold case known as ""AGENT M""...or ""AGENT MOON"", which was highly classified and not open to discussion among anyone on or outside the base. I found the mood changed in Pine Gap, and the ensuing months were darker in emotional bond, Sombre and tense. &amp;nbsp; I found it hard to push the case out of my mind, and I pondered how such secrecy was even possible, given the technology we were using to monitor the entire world. &amp;nbsp; Still, life went on, even as I went through a complicated divorce with my wife Rosie. I remember having a rather frightening dream in August of 2010. In many ways I wish I'd viewed that dream as a prophetic warning to keep myself --far away --from the AGENT MOON case, and just forget it. I don't know if dreams can be prophetic, I only know as terrifying as the dream was at the time, it was nothing compared to things I was soon to learn from my wayward curiosity into forbidden casefiles. &amp;nbsp; In my dream I was staring at a large tower, Victorian and ornate like Westminster Abbey, eroding sandstone walls tarnished from weary years. There was a large green window in the top of the tower, and as I stared at it, something about the colour green began to make me feel uneasy, it was sort of an off chartreuse, like an olive coloured cellophane. But amidst the stained glass I thought I could make out a kind of hominid shape. &amp;nbsp; Then I had looked down to find my fist was clenched, as I realised something was inside my palm.. I slowly opened my fingers. To my absolute disgust and terror I found a bloody pair of children's underwear with a note inside it, although paralysed with sickness, I turned over the note with my thumb... and read the message written in green texta. A delicate handwriting. It was labelled 'POLYPHEMUS' which for some reason my brain interpreted as a code name. Beneath it was written 'THE CYCLOPS WITH THE GREEN EYE STARES DOWN AT THE HERO WHO WOULD EXPOSE HIM. HIS NAME WAS NOBODY.' &amp;nbsp; The next thing I knew I was inside the room in the highest room of the tower. I could tell because I was staring at the stained glass window, and the whole room was an emerald green colour. I remember feeling a sudden pain in my skull, and as I reached up to touch the top of my head, I saw blood on my fingers. Dripping blood. Feeling more rapidly, I found there was a mark carved out of my flesh. I could almost feel my brain throbbing,....then I awoke. &amp;nbsp; At this time, Rosie and I were still living together, and part of the reason the dream stuck with me so profoundly was that when I had walked downstairs - Rosie had left me a note on the dining room table. I recall the fridge was making an offputting low moan amidst the bird songs of summer heat. I approached the note still half asleep, and was jolted to life like a cold shower upon reading the words; 'LOCK BACK DOOR. NOBODY HOME TONIGHT'. Something about the repeat use of the word NOBODY resonated in some frightening way with my dream. &amp;nbsp; I'm not the type to be too distracted by the subconscious world, however during my commute to work I had taken to reading books on Balinese mythology, who's ancient culture managed to escape the harsh suppression of Islamic extremism in other surrounding Indonesian islands, was mildly sinister. The Balinese religion is on the whole a rather frightening mixture of Hindu, Buddhist and ancient paganism which seems to elevate darker gods in its pantheon of deities. Most impressively, the latest chapters I had read had isolated strong beliefs in the connections between prophetic dreams and demonic spirits of the Balinese pantheon. The Balinese believed that dream states opened the individual up to the spirit world and made them susceptible to demonic communication... and sometimes possession. &amp;nbsp; I recall this as a trying time, and the start of my descent into a sullen state of being. They were a relative mundane two months though, when contrasted with my uncovering of the nature of the ""AGENT M"" case upon the third month. I had taken a break from technical management in that period, preferring to distract myself with the more mundane task of monitoring and logging spy footage. I'm not exaggerating to tell you that I've had far too much insight into the real lives of the global public. Not just the public face people post on their social media accounts. I've seen the dark side of your lives, surprisingly it becomes more mundane than you might expect. The amount of time most of you spend just sitting there propped up in front of the computer for instance is one of the more bizzare revelations. It's disheartening to view how much time the average person spends trying to fabricate a more interesting life for themselves to friends and co workers, when in fact most of their time is spent idly clicking windows. It seems like many people would sooner share a photo of themselves on the toilet than behind a keyboard. &amp;nbsp; Watching people masturbate is hilarious but disturbing enough. It's the little traits that are the most embarrassing. The little MO that the individual unavoidably falls into, standing on a couch, using clothing or socks, crying afterwards, suffocating themselves with a pillow, eating whilst masturbating. &amp;nbsp; It was during this time, learning all too much about the general public, I found myself reading too much into scenarios. When you see the in depth puzzle patterns of people's lives, you start to feel like you notice an underlying logic to it all. A patchwork quilt of cause and effect. For instance--- relationships....you watch people's behaviour, the minor patterns which slowly cause deterioration of emotional bonds. It starts with white lies and little factual cover ups. Then subconscious behaviour starts to manifest, instead of sex the guy starts spending way too much time on reddit, the girl takes up crocheting or starts talking to her friends more often on the phone. You can almost foresee the future, just by the map of behaviour people display. Anyway, none of that could help my own situation. Couldn't save my relationship with Rosie, or stop her filing for divorce. &amp;nbsp; There's this trail of red dirt I walk everyday on my way to work. The red dust here in the outbreak can be obliterating at times. Has a haunting, oppressive feeling. I remember thinking about that on the way to work, the day I learnt the truth about the AGENT M case. &amp;nbsp; I don't know how I managed to broach the subject with Jake Finnegan. We were offsite, working in the mines down in Salters Creek. My curiosity had gotten the better of me, and I asked the unaskable. Finnegan seemed to know a lot about the case, turned out he had been working on it years ago, before it became subject non grata. Finnegan is a bristle faced swede. Not emotional. It's as if the nerves in his face have frozen from too many winters. I've never seen the bastard smile. Anyway, for some reason he trusts me. Tells me about an old murder that happened on another base in Perth. That's the capital of Western Australia. Apparently there was an investigation into an explosion on the Perth base in 2008. Three soldiers and personnel were killed, and it was assumed Islamic terrorism was somehow to blame. Finnegan was working the case, and had a bunch of details that were deemed essential to solving it. Then suddenly he found himself in a boardroom with a group of high ranking generals. He handed over all his files. Was sworn to secrecy. Threatened. &amp;nbsp; Of course Finnegan was hesitant to give me much information, and i was sensitive to his anxieties. He told me that he'd prefer not to say anything more about it, but that if I really want to know the truth about ""AGENT M"" then it WAS possible to learn more. There was access available. He could give me the clearance so long as I swore I'd never mention a word of it to him ever again. Stupidly, I took the hook and the bait. &amp;nbsp; I'll outline the process I went through to get the information briefly. But if I preface that by saying it was a lot more complicated and difficult than it's going to sound. Firstly, I had to make contact with the sleeper out of Alice. Finnegan was pretty insistent about that. I had to take the weekend to get out to Reachers Farm, the only backpackers Internet cafe in the Territory. I won't divulge the websites or passwords online. It's pre 1997 internet in Reachers Farm by the way, so the process was tedious, a cauldron-eyed Indian man, staring at me with his onyx eyes the whole while. &amp;nbsp; Statue of the elephant god Ganesh holding his fingers in a devils salute behind him. Incense smoke rolling in dreamy waves. Outside a camel tied up by an old, brown rope. Did you know there is a camel problem in the territory? Yeah... that's a long story you can read about yourself. People only give a shit about the god damn crock attacks ..and viral fist fights between yobbos and kangaroos. &amp;nbsp; I had to drive to another location to pick up the disk. I masked up for the occasion in a standard military issue balaclava. Ran and retrieved the object. It was, by accounts, a delicate silver hard drive in the shape of an old fashioned, decorative key. I returned to Reachers Farm to watch the footage in the only obscurity left on earth. It's actually hilarious how little coverage we have of Alice. Our facility is right in the middle of the most unmonitored region in the Southern Hemisphere. &amp;nbsp; (As an aside, any aspiring terrorists out there, if you want a location to coordinate a terrorist cell, you might want to grab you and your mates a job in a retirement home.) Our agency officially stopped logging footage in care homes in 2014, because it was just too fucking tedious. Now that I've said that, good citizens, if you do find yourself in a home sometime in the future and chance to spy a couple of tanned and bearded jihadist care workers whispering in the hallways or nurses stations, you might want to call crime-stoppers. &amp;nbsp; Finally I had the AGENT MOON case in front of me. But relief was quickly assuaged by a preternatural sense of guilt and terror when I remembered that my initial attraction to the case was the brutal torture, sodomy and murder of a couple of young girls. &amp;nbsp; I began the arduos process of decoding wave after wave of encrypted file. I found the case files confusing, given that there didn't seem to be one particular incident which the files were centred on. Rather, the bulk of the content of the case seemed to revolve around multiple breaches across a wide variety of military bases, over an extended period of time. The breaches were all linked to gruesome crimes that occurred in a similar proximity to each particular breached base, and all of the breaches shared similar circumstances. In each case, a military or agency base was compromised by an unauthorised entry, which generally wasn't witnessed or recorded on film. In each case, the fake login account had bypassed the security mainframe with a binary code, and the fake identity was logged in the system as some similar variation of an alias, such as and including; AGENT M, AGENT MK____, AGENT MOON, AGENT MOON KING, AGENT MOON KEY, AGENT MONKEY, AGENT MONK, AGENT MISSING, AGENT NOKING. &amp;nbsp; It was easy enough to trace the historic leads and make theories. From around 2007 the cases were treated mostly as a linked series of cyber attacks. There was a daunting list of suspects and footage logged in searching for the culprits. Cells of 'Anonymous' hackers, Chinese intelligence agencies, the Mossad, Alkeida. By 2008 a series of money trail tracings had linked the breaches to a multinational corporation called FLATRON seemingly operated out of Malta. But this lead proved fruitless, and as the list of grotesque crimes grew and were subsequently proved linked to the breaches --detective work shifted to other avenues. &amp;nbsp; There was a girl who was attacked and raped in Hawaii, at the same time that a breach occurred in Fort Shafter. It seemed to be linked to the AGENT M network, and amazingly the girl had survived. She identified a man dressed in military attire, wearing a cap over his eyes. A thick ring on his finger...middle aged... as her attacker. &amp;nbsp; Finally there was a lead in the AGENT MOON case, ....but then ....it was shut down internally. I found myself shocked when I read that the earlier case was also shut down by my superior Reginald Howard. &amp;nbsp; Suspicious, I found myself compelled to look more into Howard's past by searching the database using my higher access level. It seems like Howard was an extremely active Agent in the 1990's. Whilst he was stationed at Pine Gap every few years, I notice that he was transferred to various bases around the country, and overseas. In 1996 Howard is in Port Arthur, and according to his write up was involved in PROJECT HANDOVER, where he was listed as 'mentoring' one Martin Bryant. Anyone familiar with Australian history will raise an eyebrow or two at that. URL &amp;nbsp; Although the case list was vague, --I was aware there had long been internal rumours that Port Arthur was a black ops mission to increase popularity for Australia's gun control laws, which were formulated immediately after the massacre... as part of the National Firearms Programme Implementation Act of 1996. The information I was learning seemed to be casting a darker light on my superior even than I had already imagined. Things only got more disturbing. In 2003 Howard was accused of child molestation by several girls in Perth during a period when he was stationed out there. Remarkably, the charges appeared to have been dropped after the mysterious death of one of the accusers, and another girl who claimed threats were made to her, but then subsequently dropped all charges. &amp;nbsp; What's more, I noticed that a large portion of the breaches linked to AGENT MOON happened on or around areas where Reginald Howard had been stationed. &amp;nbsp; The next few weeks at work were entirely bleak. I intuitively gleaned that Howard had begun delivering me cold, unwavering glares...as though he was aware of some change in me. Mutual suspicion feeding on itself. Part of me wanted to blot out everything I had learned, and return to a state of semi blissful ignorance, but this was made even more difficult by the fact that other truth seekers seemed to have discovered me since I logged the AGENT MOON casefiles. I received anonymous emails with further clues to the case. In one instance I received a most unnerving price of evidence which I couldn't verify. The aforementioned document was a piece of CCTV footage, purporting to be from one of the AGENT MOON breaches. I watched it cautiously at home, marvelling as crackled footage seemed to reveal the shadowy figure of Reginald Howard, walking down the corridor of the breached base. With Rosie gone, and frequently less to stay for, and heightened fear... I began formulating a plan of escape. I sorted plans to fly to Hexton in NSW. &amp;nbsp; But I still saw out the next week at Pine Gap. When Howard called me into his office on Wednesday, I knew that he was onto something. I thought about making a run for it on the spot, but there was no way I could leave the base without alerting attention to myself. Sweating and terrified, I bit the bullet and walked into Howard's office. The automatic steel door, closed and locked mechanically behind me. Howard was facing a wall of computers with his back turned toward me. &amp;nbsp; Trying to maintain composure I stuttered 'You called for me sir?'. &amp;nbsp; I could hear Reginald adjusting himself, breathing heavily in a chorus of mild sighs. Finally the voice projected from his lungs like words jumping from a loudspeaker, 'You're in deep Doo Doo aren't you Private?' his words echoed. &amp;nbsp; 'Sir?' &amp;nbsp; He turned now, keeping half his face in shadow from a standard issue military cap. 'I knew you were an inquisitive one Kelly, that's why I hired you.' He picked up a Manila folder next to him, opening it slowly and leafing through the pages with his thumb. 'To be fair sir, it is my job to investigate....things.' Howard scowled; 'You've done your dash with this MOON case Kelly. You should've followed protocol on this one.' Howard seemed to speak about the case as if it was a powerful street drug I was addicted to, I was just wondering how he knew, 'Admit it!' He yelled, 'You've been investigating the MOON case. Is it eating you alive? Is it burrowing into your brain yet Kelly?' I froze, 'I don't know what you're referring to sir' 'Come on Private. What kind of a loon do you take me for? We are spying on 99 percent of the goddamn world, you think your actions are somehow off the grid?' I just gulped, saying nothing. &amp;nbsp; 'I gather you probably think I have something to do with this, don't you private? You probably think I'm going to kill you, now. Don't you? Fortunately for you you're wrong. It's not me you've got to be paranoid about. I may rough you up a little for your own good, but you ought to know I'm not capable of murdering my own..... fucks sake....fffff..... I'm only going to give you this warning once Private Kelly, drop this line of investigation if you value your sanity.' Reginald raised his arm violently, seeming to point outside the room, the look of terror and beads of sweat on his face seemed to authenticate his sincerity; 'That thing out there is just a mind fucker waiting to rape your virgin brain. There's a reason some things are kept from the public private Kelly. That presence you sense, that force, if you keep following it ..... I swear to Christ it will utterly tear your soul apart.' &amp;nbsp; Of course I didn't believe him, but I wanted Howard to think I did. I knew if I could just get out of there alive that afternoon, tomorrow I'd be on a light plane to Hexton, Sydney. I allowed him to debrief me. Confessed to following the AGENT M case out of loyalty to his daughter. I watched him ball his eyes out. If they were puppy dog tears they sure were convincing. Once more Howard took out his rage on me. I left work bruised... but alive. &amp;nbsp; My contact Catherine didn't ask questions about me borrowing her plane. It wasn't the first time I'd used it on account of top secret government business, no questions asked, she knew the score. There was a mild relief at the imminence of my escape, but it was cloaked in anxiety, burdened with confusion. Doubts forming in my mind, from some of the things Howard had said to me during the debrief. About 'riding my own trip'. Then the incident when I had arrived home, .... something had tempted me to watch the CCTV footage again ...before deleting it and leaving. I'd assumed that now Howard was onto me he must have hacked my files, and that would explain the discrepancy. But something about that theory didn't sit right. The video was sitting in the folder I had left it, unwatched, time stamps the same as last I'd logged. The thing is, the video I watched the second time, wasn't the same video I watched the last time. The hallway looked the same, the interference and digital white noise, but there was no footage of Howard walking. In his place was an unidentifiable ghosted image, mildly inhuman looking. Something which hurt the eyes to look at. Some non mathematical logic which didn't sit right with the waking brain. I quickly deleted the video. But now the unknown figure in the hallway began to plague me. What if Howard wasn't the killer? What if the information from the sleeper had been tampered with in the first place? This was the age of doctored information. Without authorisation on information how can we be sure if anything is real or not? &amp;nbsp; The weather held out perfectly for my flight to Sydney, but the unlabelled terror stayed with me. There is something inexplainable that occurs in the mind, between the raw experience of the waking world, and the lucid fluidity of the dream state. Some terrible hand points constantly outward to a paranoid king, sitting in the throne of ones brain. The whisking clouds and lego world below me felt incalculably fake. &amp;nbsp; Hiding out is a difficult task for the confirmed paranoid. Once you know that you're being watched everywhere, where can you hide? Only in dreams. &amp;nbsp; There are days I wonder if I was groomed to release info on AGENT M. That's the way these people operate. &amp;nbsp; I can't quite put into words what compelled me to take the Stanley knife, and cut the skin off my own hand. It is an inner sickness I can acknowledge but cannot expel. I believe maybe I wanted to look at the delicate formation of veins, arteries and muscle tissue wrapped around the knuckles and bones of my own hand. In some ways, to view that grand design, that artful tapestry as it pumped blood around, and spurted pus. Natures art brought me closer to the universal God. &amp;nbsp; Once that most unfathomable moment happened, I suppose there was little regard for the sanctity of the sensory body. &amp;nbsp; It had been in East Hexton where the final cut with reality had occurred. Hiding out disguised with a troupe of filthy homeless men beneath the bridge behind St Marks church. Going out to hunt for food was something I feared and loathed, yet there seemed little option. The incident came as an unexpected nightmare. &amp;nbsp; At first I hadn't recognised the building I looked up at. Then a terrible awestriking fear punched me in the heart. &amp;nbsp; It was the tower from my dream. But it was real. The sandstone gothic structure stood laughing and dominating the skyline. At the top of the turret was the green stain glassed window. Calling out to me. Hexton Town Hall. &amp;nbsp; With a sense of nausea and dizziness, I staggered across the road, J walking, looking up, almost being hit by a bus. The sound of a horn screaming out into the sky. Madness greeted me on the pavement on the other side of the street. &amp;nbsp; The little girl was staring at me, with a knowing look, a look of worry not befitting of a little girl. She couldn't have been older then seven. Her green dress blew in the breeze. Other commuters pushed by me with blind fury, but the little girl seemed to recognise my terror. She had a piece of paper in her hand. As my shadow fell over her, tiny fingers held the page delicately in the air. Gesturing with my hands, i motioned to ask if the picture was for me and the little girl nodded her head. &amp;nbsp; Holding the picture up with foreboding I saw it was a child's picture drawn with crayon. Although the drawings were crude, I could tell what the picture was. There was a tall stick figure, and a small stick figure, then towering above them was a monstrous cyclops with one terrible green eye, scribbled on the page as if... as if the eye was made of fire!! &amp;nbsp; 'Why did you draw this?' I asked the little girl, with a trembling voice. &amp;nbsp; The little girl looked down at her shoes, and spoke as if she was passing on a message from someone else 'It's an imbotation'. Terrified, I tried not to yell at the girl, and take out my anger on her 'From who? Why did you draw this?'. She looked up at me now, her black eyes flickered and her face forged a pained expression. 'The bad men.' She said 'Up in the tower. They want you to go to the green room....' 'What's up there?' I yelled, 'What's in the green room?' The little girl broke into tears, unable to cope with my accidentally threatening voice, finally she stopped sobbing 'That's the....l....that's the brain.....the l....of the giant....have to go...for...the labotomy....for the labotomy....' 'A laboratory?' I asked loudly, 'Are you saying laboratory?' The girl now made another painful face and held her hands between her legs, twisting from side to side 'I need to go to the lavatory' 'The bathroom? Oh....' I said relieved, feeling temporarily restored to normality, 'You want to go to the toilet? Where are your parents? Here let me help you.' I held out my hand to try to take the girl to safety. Suddenly she began to scream, drawing attention from the crowd. She screamed and shook with rage. 'Shhh. Shhh' I tried to comfort the girl, '...don't you want me to help you find your parents?' The girl just kept screaming and it was only then I remembered I was disguised like a urine soaked homeless man. No wonder she was terrified. I knew I was drawing too much attention to myself. Though I wanted to help the girl, I dropped the paper and ran. Ran blindly away, foolishly and wayward towards the door of the tower from my dream. &amp;nbsp; What strange thing had possessed me to enter the tower that day. I know not. I had drifted like a moth to a flame. With suppressed vertigo and madness I had scrambled up the fire stairs, not knowing my destination, only knowing that I had to climb higher. &amp;nbsp; Dashing up flight after flight, losing my breath, as the church bells down in St Marks echoed through Hexton city. Finally like a wild lion, in my ragged clothing I stumbled into the passage way that led to the room beneath the green window. It was dark, but my eyes adjusted as I entered. Fixated upon the roof of the attic, which was painted like an old temple, crackling paint displayed a night sky, with the face of the moon painted above in thick yellow oil paint. &amp;nbsp; Beneath the painted ceiling, in the green tinted room was the big surprise. Nothing inside my imagination had expected the woman to be there. I did not recognise her face, but her expression was one of expectation, as if she knew me. She was erotic in her beauty. Lush brown hair. Gum shoulders. The cotton robes she wore were flung aside revealing the perfect body beneath. Her breasts were tantalising melons, her soft skin rolled about voluptuous curves, her hips invited the taste buds to druel, the jaws begged to bite into the flesh like a ripe green apple. &amp;nbsp; I knew it was a trap. &amp;nbsp; But as the woman spread her legs and pursed herself like some inviting plant, I could do nothing but stagger toward her. I pulled my own clothes off and staggered towards her, falling upon the body, pulsating and erect I penetrated the naked woman. &amp;nbsp; There was a touch of paradise before the true horror began. I should have known the woman was not what she seemed. The green colour took over my mind, filling the void of my soul and dominating me like a terrible symphony. I felt the veins within plucked like the strings of some terrible instrument. &amp;nbsp; Oh please don't make me tell you what happened inside the green room of the tower. Oh please don't make me tell you. The thing is too monstrous to put into words. When you strip back the paint upon the walls everything is vulnerable like the flesh of a vagina. Like the flesh beneath the skin on my hand. &amp;nbsp; Pulsating veins. &amp;nbsp; Interconnected &amp;nbsp; Oh god that sight infects my brain. Writhing. Worms inside my brain. Screams blowing through the trees. Cables howling in the storm. Skyscrapers rock with a low moan. Night time swallows all the day, and the green fire burns inside the heart until it turns black and dies."

I knew I couldnt stay there anymore. It was time to find a different place to live, maybe forever. I grabbed my suitcases from the bedroom closet and started filling them with clothes and personal things. I shoved Bruce rather unceremoniously in his cat carrier along with a stuffed mouse he liked to play with, hoping it would help quell his anger with me. The voices were rising outside of my apartment, but more and more police were arriving downstairs, the sirens reaching high into the air. I looked out of my living room window and saw a large group of people had congregated outside of my apartment building as well. How did all of these people know where I lived? Maybe the police showing up had attracted them? Who knows. My phone had vibrated itself off the table where I had left it following my call to Sgt. Daniels, muffled by the throw rug underneath, but still blasting a steady stream of text message tones and missed calls. While waiting for someone to tell me it was safe to open my door, I started flipping through the text messages. A few of them were from some close family and friends, asking if I was ok and why I hadnt told them anything, statements that read more like betrayal of being left out than concern of the situation I had gotten myself into. My brother and mother had both messaged me, saying to call them as soon as possible. The only one who had seemed genuine in her concern was Grace, who kept asking me to call her back, saying she knew I wouldnt do anything to harm anyone and she loved me. We had never been on love terms but it was the nicest thing anyone had said in a while. I hadnt seen her these last few weeks, because she had been on back to back business trips for her marketing job which took her all over the country. I had kept track of her on Facebook a bit, seen all of the happy, smiling pictures she had posted from her travels; she had even managed to sneak her boyfriend along for some of the trips. I envied her carefree lifestyle, and her freedom. I texted her back to say I was ok and would talk to her soon, that I was sorry and never would have let this happen if I had known what would go on after. She sent me a few other messages saying she would happily put me up for a while, or come and see me when she was back in town, but I refused saying I didnt want to put her in danger. She was incredible; a true friend in the midst of the terrible storm. After what seemed like ages, I heard Sgt. Daniels pounding on my door, asking me to let him in. I walked slowly there and checked the peephole before letting him and Sgt. Elden in, then turning away back to my bedroom to finish packing. Good, Im glad youre already packing, said Sgt. Daniels calmly, as he walked in behind me and offered his assistance. Sgt. Elden snapped the door shut behind him and followed as well, settling into a corner of my bedroom, watching me with a mixture of concern and sadness in his eyes. I couldnt say much to them while we picked through my things to determine what could stay and what should come along. I did point to my laptop, which still had the new message up on the screen from the killer. Sgt. Elden immediately turned to look at it with Sgt. Daniels following closely. Shit, I heard Sgt. Elden say. This fucker is sick. They both came back into my room, where I had finally collapsed on the edge of my bad, staring down into my hands that lay palms up in my lap. Sgt. Daniels knelt in front of me and took my hands in his, waiting for me to look up at him. Tears ran hot down my cheeks as I tried to open my mouth, but my throat was closed too tightly so I couldnt speak. I just stared into his eyes, completely lost with what to say or do. *This was all my fault,* I thought miserably. I couldnt change it, or do enough to fix it. This isnt your fault, Lizzy. You came to us as soon as you recognized him. You did everything you could to inform us of his motives. You could never have known what was going to happen. You were doing the right thing, and have been doing the right thing since the beginning, he looked at me sadly, trying to say all the reassuring things I needed to hear, but I just couldnt believe them anymore. Come on, kiddo, he pulled me up slowly and pulled me close- hugging me like a father would his daughter. I sank into that hug, tears soaking into his blazer while I sobbed into his chest. He held me tightly until I could control my crying, then took my shoulders and gave me a reassuring nod. I asked them to step out so I could change (I had been in my PJs and bathrobe all day, like a bum) and slipped into some jeans, a t-shirt, and a flannel button down on top. I found my big, bug-eyed sunglasses on a closet shelf and a baseball cap. I figured if that crowd was for me, I was going to make myself as downplayed and incognito as possible. I stepped out of the bedroom with my two suitcases and said I was ready to go. They called two patrolmen into my apartment and had them take my suitcases. I picked up Bruce and we made our way into the hall. I stopped to lock my door and found our landlady just outside. She hugged me, which I didnt at all expect, and swore to make sure my apartment remained untouched while I was gone. I thanked her, and was swept away by my escort towards the stairs. Most of the hallway had been cleared of my neighbors, and the few who lingered in their doorways looked at me in different ways: some were concerned, others looked afraid, and a couple even looked angry with me as I walked by. I tried to keep my head down and focus on my feet, but Bruce was making quite a fuss in his kennel and I had to keep shushing him as we walked. Once we got to the stairs, people in the stairwell that I only knew vaguely by sight were calling out to me angrily as I passed, while the police tried to shove them out of the way back into their respective places. How could you do this? My friend was shot at Jingles! one woman screamed at me, and the police moved her along, blocking her view of me as she carried on around them, spewing venom in my direction. I began to respond, to apologize, but nothing came out as I was hurried along down the stairs. Others were silent but stared at me questioningly, suspicious of who I was and if I was really involved with the terrible events striking the city. As we moved, Sgt. Eldens phone went off and he answered immediately, cursing loudly as he listened to whoever spoke on the other end of the line. That asshole released her address to the public. People are swarming here now, theres already a huge crowd out front, he said angrily, his brow pouring with sweat from the descent to the 3rd floor. He turned to me and asked, Is there a back way out of here? Another exit where we can get out without hitting that crowd? No, I said, dejected, the only back exits lead to an alley that loops around to the front. All the exits bring you around to the main street. Damn it, Sgt. Daniels replied. He looked at me and I just nodded. Tears were welling in my eyes again, but I had to suck it up. I knew Id have to face the crowd, and I was trying to mentally prepare myself for seeing hordes of angry people, but nothing really can. We made our way down the stairs to the lobby and I could see multiple officers facing a large crowd that was pushing at them, screaming and yelling wildly while the police worked to hold them back. The officers in my escort encircled me with Sgt. Elden and Sgt. Daniels on either side while we made our way to the double doors. Someone in the crowd saw us coming and pointed accusingly, and the officers started to force them back as we made our way onto the sidewalk towards a patrol car. My ears were blasted with the noise. Angry shouts echoed around me, paper and objects flew toward us while we struggled to the police cards. The 25 feet from the door to the streets edge took an eternity, and I couldnt block out the screams of the crowd around us. LOOK WHAT YOU HAVE DONE! This is all your fault! My sister died because of you! What is your problem?! Youre just as bad as that shooter is! How can you live with yourself?! It went on and on. I just pushed against the officers in front of me and Sgt. Daniels and Sgt. Elden fought through with me, and we finally made it to the police cars. Both sergeants got in on either side of me, my bags were snapped shut into the trunk, and we took off in a motorcade towards the nearest police station. My phone vibrated in my pocket again: 29 missed called and over 40 text messages. Sgt. Daniels noticed me looking at them and slowly took my phone from my hand. Its likely your phone number was released too, and you dont need to see all of that right now, he said calmly. I knew he was right, and I watched him slip my phone into his coat pocket. Bruce was tucked in my lap and he meowed in an agonizing way. I looked into his bright green eyes and wished I could just be my cat. Cats dont have to deal with all this. Cats eat, sleep, bathe, and eat. They have it so easy We finally pulled up to the police station, where news vans and another crowd were being held back by a barricade the officers had set up. Reporters yelled out questions and brandished their microphones like swords at us as we made our way into the precinct. I didnt say anything; what could I have said? They sat me down at Sgt. Daniels desk and he brought me some water. I was told they were looking for a place I could stay for a while. Sgt. Daniels had offered to let me stay at his home outside of the city, and they said it was a possibility if they couldnt locate a suitable location. I felt like it was putting him in greater danger, but he argued it was ideal because he lived alone in a good, gated neighborhood and could keep closer tabs on me. I just wanted to wait and see what they came up with. The entire precinct was in more of an uproar than I had ever seen, but it was the only place where people werent staring at me with looks of disgust, or yelling disparaging comments. They all knew I had been trying to help as much as I could, or at least they didnt let on that they felt otherwise. I again handed my laptop over for them to trace the email, but I assumed it would again lead to a phony identity. I looked around as everyone else was bustling about with their business, and noticed that Sgt. Daniels had put my phone down on the far side of his desk, away from where I sat. I made sure he wasnt around before I picked it up. Some of the messages were from new numbers I did not recognize, and still others were from people I knew but hadnt heard from in ages. I ignored their contents for the most part and instead flipped to my contacts where I found my moms entry and dialed it. She picked up on the first ring. Lizzy? Oh my God, what is going on? Are you ok? Are you hurt? I got a call from your cousin saying you were on the news- youre involved with the shooting investigation everyone has been talking about? She sounded frantic and worried, exactly how any mother would sound if their daughter was linked to a psycho shooter in the big city. I shushed her a few times and finally was able to stop her list of questions so I could respond. Im ok, mom. I semi-meant it. I had taken another of the anxiety meds the doctor had given me when I arrived at the station and it was taking effect beautifully. I was turning the bottle in my hand and noticed I had been granted a few more refills. *Thank God for that doctor,* I thought gratefully. I filled her in on everything that had happened since the bus stop incident, and how I had been working with the police once I recognized him. She believed every word, and kept telling me to come home, stay with them, that I would be safer there, but I wouldnt relent on the matter; I swore I would stay in the city and help with whatever I could. My true motive was that I had no idea how far this man would go to find me, and I couldnt bear to involve my parents. Dad was standing nearby and kept adding in his two cents, even offering to fly to me and protect me himself. I told him absolutely not, they would stay there at home, hundreds of miles away, because I was being moved to a safe location. It took some time, but eventually they conceded and made me swear to keep them informed from that point forward. I promised to call again soon, and we said our I love yous and goodbyes before hanging up. Seconds after getting off the phone, I heard a commotion coming up the hall. I leaned over in my chair to see if I could locate the source, and immediately saw a number of people walking towards me, Sgt. Daniels in the lead. He saw me watching and pursed his lips, brow furrowing deeply as he approached. Before he could get anything out, another man I had never seen before in chic reading glasses and spiked brown hair blurted out excitedly, You just got an email from him. We need you now. I hadnt been paying any attention to my email on my phone, having had a constant stream of texts and calls playing across the screen, but I got up slowly and walked towards the group. Sgt. Daniels stopped me and looked in my eyes before quietly saying, I know youve been through a lot today, but we really need your help on this. Can you handle it? I did the only thing I could do: I nodded my head yes. After all, it had been the biggest reason to stay- finding a way to catch this lunatic that found killing to be a game. I had to end the game as soon as possible, not matter what it took. I was led down the hall swiftly and through a set of double doors labeled Cyber Crime Unit, maneuvering through a labyrinth of computers, wires, and special equipment I had never seen before except in movies. The guy with glasses led me to a desk with my laptop, where a young woman sat gazing intently into multiple monitors, dripping with code and commands with no meaning to me. She typed like lightening, her fingers moving across the keyboard at an insane pace, barely glancing in my direction as she moved aside just enough so I could squeeze in next to her and look at my computer. On the screen was an already opened email from Bulletmania again. The Subject line of the email read **YOUR CHOICE**, but there was no other text. Instead, two pictures displayed next to each other showed the faces of a man and woman I had never seen before. I look at them intently, trying to figure out what there faces should mean to me. Do I know them? The man was maybe middle age, with sandy blonde hair and brown eyes, smiling happily at something off camera. He wore a bright yellow polo shirt and khaki pants, and appeared to be in a park. The woman next to him had shortly cropped black hair set in a pixie style with soft features and blue-green eyes, sipping coffee while she read a newspaper. She seemed to be at a caf, but I couldnt recognize that location either. Techie guy (I dont know what else to call him, since we hadnt been introduced) spoke first. Do you know either of these people? he asked absently as he looked from my computer screen to watch whatever Techie girl was doing. Ive never seen them before, not that I can remember, I replied carefully. The more I stared at the man, the more I thought I might have seen him, but I couldnt be sure, and did not want to say anything out of turn. He finally scrolled down further beyond the pictures, and a few words in tiny print could be seen at the bottom of the email: **One Hour. Choose.** It finally sank in. The killer had chosen his new targets, but they werent locations anymore, they were individual people. My heart was beating a mile a minute as it all became clear, and I looked up at Sgt. Daniels in horror. He, however, was determined and didnt skip a beat. You wont answer, he said to me harshly. Sonya, (Techie girl), run these faces against our drivers license database, see if you can identify either of them, he commanded. It will take too much time, she replied nervously, there are millions of people in that database! I dont give a damn, run it! he shouted angrily. We have to try! She and two others immediately set to work, analyzing both photos and then running them against all pictures in the drivers license database for the city. For all we knew, they werent even registered in the state, but we had to start somewhere. I wanted to try and beg the killer for more time, to respond and ask for a name, or a location, but they told me not to say anything. I watched as face after face barely blipped across the screen as they scanned licenses, but nothing was coming up. The email had been sent 5 minutes before they came to get me, which meant we had only 55 minutes to respond. The database hadnt even been searched 20 minutes before a picture resembling that of the man had been found. Sonya was shocked, thinking there was no chance in hell it would happen for either of them, but I guess we got lucky; Peter Williamson was his name, 45 years old according to his license. They took down his address and sent 4 patrol cars over there while the cyber crimes team continued to search for the unknown woman. Nothing was coming up for her; no one seemed to resemble her in the database as license after license crossed the screen. I could only pray they made it to the mans house in time, as he was across town from the precinct, but Sgt. Daniels reminded me that there were cops all over the city and thankfully he was in a suburb just outside of the city limits that at least one unit wasnt far from. Minutes were passing at an uncontrollably fast pace as we continued searching for the woman and awaited a call about the man. We must have seen hundreds of them by now but nothing seemed to match her picture. Less than 5 minutes before the hour mark was up, we received a call from one of the patrol units- he was almost at Peters house. We knew we would not find the woman in time, but prayed that Peter would be ok In no time, however, the hour was up. My heart was beating so hard against my chest I thought it might burst through my ribcage. Sgt. Daniels was gripping the back of my chair with such force I thought he might snap it in half. We were all staring at the license screen when FINALLY a match for the woman popped up. Cindi Manor, she was in her mid-twenties. A further 4 units were directed to her apartment in the complete opposite direction of Peter Williamsons home- about 40 miles in the other direction. As Sgt. Daniels completed his order to those units, a call came through from an Officer Givens who had arrived at the Williamson residence. Sgt. Daniels answered his phone immediately and I strained to hear anything from his call. Sgt. Daniels face was crestfallen as he listened, and he turned away before slamming his hand repeatedly against a far wall, yelling out in ferocious anger at the top of his voice. GOD DAMN THAT ASSHOLE! he screamed furiously. He didnt have to say anything; I knew what he must have heard. Peter was dead. And I would bet money that Cindi was too. How could he have been in those two places at once? It was impossible! What if I had chosen one? Would they have been spared? Within 15 minutes we received a call about Cindi- cause of death being a gunshot wound to the head, execution style. She had been so young. Both had been too young. Neither had deserved this. Seconds following this revelation, a new email appeared on the screen. Two new pictures, side by side, of two people I had never seen before: a young man with black, scraggly hair and a number of tattoos on his neck and arms, and an elderly man with glasses and a distinctive gold walking cane. Except the Subject line had changed this time, reading Better Choose. The process started all over again, with license pictures shooting rapidly across the screen. The police wasted no more time, preparing a statement for the media advising everyone statewide to lock their doors and windows, and report any suspicious character in their vicinity. I sat helpless, clinging to the desk in front of me and wondering how the hell I could do anything to stop this. What was there to do? How could I possibly stop him from killing more innocent people? Minutes were slipping by like sand between my fingers and I could do nothing. Nothing *Except contact him myself to meet,* I thought. *Make him come for me instead.* I still had my phone in hand. Maybe I could respond to an email without them seeing? I looked at Sgt. Daniels and told him I had to go to the bathroom. He was so busy directing the flow of everything for the cyber crimes team and the patrol units on the road he agreed, telling me to come back immediately after. I had no intention of coming back. This was it, and I was going to stop him now. I slipped my phone in my pocket and made my way out of the Cyber Crimes Unit, passing the bathroom as I slipped down the stairs towards the exit. I grabbed a police jacket from a nearby desk, and pulled my hat low over my eyes; everyone was so busy running around they didnt pay me much mind. I made my way out of a side door and down the alley, passing along the barricade where all focus was on the front main doors. I hustled down the street and made my way to the subway station. I would find him, or he would find me. But I was fairly certain of one thing One of us was going to die tonight. [Final](URL"
19,cyber-crime,nosleep,Project 6,7,36t7n0,http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/36t7n0/project_6/,2015-05-22 08:45:16,"I've been a forensic investigator for about 15 years now...not the bag and tag kind, I specialize in the digital variety. The only autopsy I deal with on a daily basis is a software program that tears apart hard drives, cell phones, and other storage devices. Most of my cases deal with child pornography and drug rings. I typically get evidence after the fact. Our field techs know how to get drives or devices off scene and into my lab, so I never need to actually visit a crime scene as part of the investigation. I found this text log on a drive recently delivered to my lab, it came from another investigators laptop and it is easily the most fucked up thing I have ever read. ROLAND D., UNOFFICIAL SCENE NOTES AND PROCEDURE LOG: TODO: CLEANUP AND TRANSCRIBE TO OFFICIAL The scene was in a pretty shitty part of town and the middle of the night. Boarded up windows, broken glass, cars on bricks, a rundown pizza joint, and what I assumed were gang signs thrown up on every square inch of open brick or wall area. I was led down an alley way to a door thick with caution tape and marked out by orange traffic cones. A chainsaw was laying on its side outside the door. The lead investigator escorted me inside. I was in a long narrow hallway with flickering lights and the stench of old damp moldy basements engulfed me. On the walls were various decorations strewn about...skulls mostly, dark movie posters, video game depictions...it felt like someone wanted this place to feel like home. I could hear activity coming from the end of the hallway and make out that a wide open area existed down at the end. The gallons of blood that had been collected from the poor girl mixed amongst the tangle of tentacles were neatly lined up along the base of a black sheeted bed that sat in the middle of the room. Her body was contorted in ways only an exorcist has likely ever seen. Her mouth was agape and filled with what looked like 7 inch cylindrical metallic shielded electrical wire. Her jaw unhinged. Wires protruded from her naked flesh as if someone had threaded them with a humongous needle - looping through her entire body with the care of a master seamstress. She hung in the air above the bed, suspended in an angelic sacrificial state. But she was breathing. Fucking breathing. My eyes followed the wires to the racks of advanced computing equipment and neatly arranged datacenter in the corner. Stuffed around it were books such as ""Building Embedded Linux Systems"" and ""Linux Clusters"". The racks were fully lit and humming along - I was starting to get the gist of why I was here. As I traced my way back along the wires to the bed, I tried to ignore the fact that no blood seemed to have made its way onto the sheets and that the glass containers filled with the girl's blood were bubbling slowly. But I couldn't escape her eyes. Not dead eyes. Shining. An inner glow. Pale and blue...ocillating and flickering...seeing...all knowing. The lead investigator pointed to the top of her skull where an incision had been made just at the part of her platinum blonde hair with what looked like a USB port protruding from her skull. What in the fuck. I quickly looked around the room and took in my surroundings again. It was like a bad scene out of CSI Cyber...mocked up displays, futuristic animations on monitors that lined the room. Except for one. It scrolled familiar hex for an ASCII encoded string...70 72 6f 6a 65 63 74 20 36 Project 6 My heart, which had been racing on the precipice of cardiac arrest and explosion, felt to have stopped. These words, in various encodings, had shown up in my strangest cases over the years. Sometimes stegged into photos of kids getting fucked in the ass, sometimes embedded in audio meta information, or hidden files named with the words. Mostly though, they showed up in irrelevant techno babble files. In none of the cases did it seem particularly relevant to book the suspect, but I logged the occurence diligently anyways. Back to the girl. Her arms were laden with tattoos...circuitry, skulls, the words ""Cyber Kitten"" written in bad myspace animated gif style, and random adornments that resembled the poster references on the walls in the hallway. And she was fucking beautiful. But my job isn't to deal in physical evidence, so I put down my field kit and started collecting. I went after the racks first which were fairly simple live Linux acquisitions and memory dumps. The medical team had informed me they were not going to attempt to extract whatever device was planted in the girls skull, certain death and whatnot - they were leaving to secure transport. I went rogue. She called to me. The input was standard and my field kit was well equipped to attempt the extraction in live triage mode. The device was fairly standard and Android based. I watched the hex dump, the filesystem, I saw images (memories?), video (dreams?), and URLs (information?) come in to focus...corgies, skeletons, laughing cars, robots, debauchery, pain, pleasure, smiling faces, and miserable death. I look down and see a tortoise...its crawling towards me.... I have woken. Before losing conciousness, my eyes locked onto her magnificent irises. She is just her. Just everything. They stared into my soul - the nexus of life, of all. I questioned the universe and found answers. Pale blue colors shifted as her lips curled into a smile. Time lost meaning. I saw the apocalypse, death dealers, fire raining from the sky. Black flags of the anarchist communes that would rise from the billowing smoke of our smoldering cities. I smelled the burning flesh of my friends and family and heard their screams as they were slowly lowered into pits of red hot coals. I watched as their flesh dripped from their bones and their faces twisted up at me - blaming me, cursing me, tormenting me. I saw the demons and men who would lead the unifying armies, the earth scorching armies. They would annihilate everything and their boots would march upon cracked skulls and burnt flesh. I watched as they lay waste to thousands upon thousands of writhing naked human bodies. Watched as they poured acid from the sky and saw puddles of people form in the streets. I knew somehow that this woman, this girl, this wonder was at the heart of preventing this certainty and she must be protected at all costs. The investigation team is slaughtered and death now surrounds me. Except for the nexus, the center, she lives. She must. I've acquired her conciousness. Her being. Its sitting on my external hard drive, now write blocked. Its seeding through torrents to the world. It must be distributed. It must always exist. My keyboard is stained in blood as I type this. My hands apparently capable of ripping out the throats of those who seek to harm such beauty. Capable of impaling human flesh and ripping tendons. And, thankfully, blockading doorways and entries into my sanctuary. What was once a clean and spotless scene, is now drenched with the blood of my former colleagues. It drips, still wet down the walls and pools beneath my feet. I am bathing in glorious victory. And now they come. Their screams echo in my brain, now cavernous, a single focus. Protect. Survive. Sustain. Steel collisions bellowing and echoing through the concrete walls. They are upon me. END NOTE I've started seeing Project 6 references show up in unallocated space on disks I've been investigating lately. I wanted to post this message before heading to a scene I just got called to (first time in 15 years). They referenced advanced computing equipment and a female victim. Its in a shitty part of town..."
