This has gone on for far too long and we need actual facts to confirm or deny these claims. Some of you may think, why should Jews open themselves to an inquiry to which I will respond with what the government always says ""If you have nothing to hide..."". I think I've personally reached a point where I don't want to think about or be bombarded by reddit about the possibility that Jews are using their protected status to hide organized crime like sex trafficking and pedophilia, engaging in unethical or predatory banking practices, or using the anti-Israel boycott act in conjunction with their association with Israel to not only commit crimes on a global level but also make themselves immune to criticism. Yes, I do know there are many Jews out there that are just trying to live their normal lives and don't want to be condemned if there is any truth to these outrageous claims. But wouldn't you rather everybody know for sure and be free of the suspicion. I personally vote that the International Criminal Court should do the investigation. Yes, I know that they have no authority to convict anyone, but a report would be nice. As an exercise about this matter just want to throw out a couple words and phrases that I keep seeing about this matter. Add your own as well and give your opinion on ones that are present that you think should be deleted. Jews, banks, hollywood, music, TV, athlete, pedophilia, sex-trafficking, Russia, Israel, nuclear, Cyber security... Absolutely no hate speech. Either offer ideas to end suspicion and/or play the wordgame."
1,cyber crime,unpopularopinion,Most people are relatively intelligent.,1,i16hi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/i16hi4/most_people_are_relatively_intelligent/,2020-07-31 22:15:39,"TL;DR: Most people are relatively intelligent, the internet just gives a false negative impression of people. Not exactly sure how unpopular this is, but Ive seen this sentiment *a lot* recently, Id say its *at least* unpopular on Reddit. I completely understand how easy it is to fall into the cynical viewpoint of most people are idiots and I sometimes catch myself thinking that after browsing Twitter or Reddit for over 4 minutes. I understand where it comes from but I just dont think its true. What the internet does is it lets everyone have a voice, every individual with an internet connection, an internet plan, and a device has a voice. In some cases, this can be really good and allows people to connect and communicate with people who they otherwise never would. This is great, but with that comes a lot of bad. Rapid spread of misinformation/propaganda, grooming, cyber crime, a lack of privacy, constant stream of negativity via media, and of course just plain people being assholes for no reason or because you have a belief that differs from theirs, and thats just to name a few. Its very easy to look at social media and the internet and say Wow, people are absolute idiots. But keep in mind, not the entire world uses the internet. I believe last time I checked only 57% of the world? Could be inaccurate. Second of all, a lot of people simply dont post, comment, or really even make their presence known on the internet. Very few Twitter and Reddit accounts actually post, majority are just lurkers, and probably a lot of bots as well. My advice to you is just go outside and talk to people, real individuals face to face, (safely, of course, given the current times) and youll find most individuals are intelligent and good people. The real world and internet world are so completely and vastly different from each-other, Its like comparing Cthulhu to Jesus. Probably should of made the post shorter, but whatever. I aint making it shorter."
2,cyber crime,unpopularopinion,The Internet/Social Media Should Have More Laws,1,gxraih,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/gxraih/the_internetsocial_media_should_have_more_laws/,2020-06-06 23:47:43,"Seriously, the Internet has become something that is of use for every person on earth (unless you're completely out of this internet culture). My problem with it is the fact that the Internet can and is used for evil and prejudice purposes, such as: - Exposing someone online - Recording people and posting it online - The creation of fake profiles - How easy it is to frame someone - The fact that a creep CAN and WILL save your pictures (Facebook and Instagram ex) - Kids being exposed to numerous kinds of information out there (bad ones) Here's one example. It's not uncommon to see videos of people getting angry and rage at someone, then have the video go viral. But here's why this is fucked up. Why is it OK to record someone in a situation like that and post it online? You're going to tell me you never got angry at someone and yelled at them? &gt;Let's make a time-lapse on every person's life and see if they haven't so.&lt; Not to mention the lack of context we see in many videos. They are used to portray someone as bad. In reality, you've cursed at your mom before, you probably cursed at your friend before, you probably road raged before, so... The only difference is that these people got caught on camera. And even if they have been mean, angry, and raged at someone, people do change, and many of them are very good people who just lost their shit. The truth is that this can fuck someone's life up, it can be marked on their life. Secondly, the fact that strangers can save our photos on Social Media. I've seen cases where people will create a fake profile on tinder, and that's really fucked up. I've also seen situations where a person will use someone else's picture and intentionally, pretend to be that person and commit cyber/civil crimes, such as pedophilia, harassment, etc. Pedophiles also have the ability to save pictures of young girls on their phones from Social Media. My solution: Netflix has a mechanism where an user that tries to screenshot/screen record, will be surprised with a black screen, covering all of the content that had been screenshot. We could add that to Social Media profiles, giving the user the option of not allowing people to save their photos, or allowing so. Fake profiles I believe Facebook/Twitter/Instagram/Tinder should in the future, start ask for identification for every user so we stop: the creation of fake profiles and framing people. Accusations and exposing someone on Social Media I also believe that things like this should be a crime. If you want to solve things, do not post someone's name online and then tell your story without context. People forget that Facebook users are not a fucking judge who study their entire life to judge a case. I can EASILY make up a story and post on Facebook accusing my Math teacher of raping me, essentially ruin his life. If this is possible, to ruin someone's life on Social Media, it's because something is very fucking wrong. To close, I just think Social Media and the Internet in general should have stronger laws and policies. Social Media can be good, but it's so fucking new that we haven't thought about the harms of it and how to make it an even safer place for all."

Would you fly on a plane made in China? The rest of the world has sacrificed quality for price. We've overlooked human rights abuse for cost savings. We've overlooked pollution and ecological destruction for cheap toys. China has a long history of using a different model than other 1st world countries. Decades ago, Chinese engineers would tour American factories. And then take information back to China and create similar products but with lower tolerances or weaker parts to lower costs. But this also reduced performance and longevity. They don't respect copyright infringement laws so piracy is rampant there. Google pulled out of China YEARS ago because their servers were getting hacked by the government daily. China does not try for innovation, they try to STEAL ideas and lower costs. Then exploit their large workforce for lower labor costs. They don't respect international rules or regulations. They lie to the world leaders and organizations. They spy, imprison and participate in cyber crime as state sponsored. Chinese people are the rudest on earth, as well as the least charitable as a nation and people. They don't respect others because their government has no respect for their own lives. Remember, this is the country that ran it's citizens over with tanks. and now has scrapped it from their history books. They don't have freedom of speech or movement. They have the most advanced and pervasive surveillance in the world. using facial recognition that is tied to a ""social score"" which in turn is tied to their ability to buy food and goods. This is not science fiction It's real. The Chinese are completely controlled by their government. Hopefully, this current situation wakes people up to the damage that buying any Chinese made product does to the world."
4,cyber crime,unpopularopinion,I wish nave people would stop complaining about Disney+ for a moment.,1,e02hbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/e02hbg/i_wish_na√Øve_people_would_stop_complaining_about/,2019-11-23 02:28:39,"This comes in 3 forms on Twitter. I dont usually like twitter but i _really_ dont like their responses because they dont understand technology &amp; new services well, and are asking the same things: 1) Disney got hacked. Disney did not get hacked. Credential Stuffing (CS) is using information on site X on site Y. This can easily be avoided if you change your email and pass for every site. If you use pass1 for every password, you cant say Disney got hacked because you neglected cyber security and went ahead and used the same information again and again. This is why a lot of companies say suggested password and alphanumerical with 1 special character so that the person who is going to bitch wont be CSed. You neglected to take an extra step and thats your fault. Disney wasnt hacked. If say i use cat@email/pass123 for say WallStreetJournal, and then wall street has been hacked. Its not Disneys problem i used cat@emial/pass123 for their platform. Problem is on the user. [What is Credential Stuffing?](URL 2) sites not working/i want my money back This annoys me even more. When you buy any new game (call of duty, NBA, FIFA, etc.) the server 99/100 is down. This happens usually because they dont expect such a turnout, and the server cant handle it. There is usually a hotfix and patch update soon after to fix this. You couldnt wait to play, so you bought it before it was stable. Thats kinda on your fault again. You jumped the gun by not waiting until its day 1 problems were fixed, and you complaining about it isnt really helping. For you to say i want my money back because i didnt understand that a service would have problems on day 1 is a dumb thing to say. You bought something before it was stable and ready. You gambled. And lost. Another one about this is i wasted 2 free trial days again, you used your trial when the platform isnt stable. You took the risk, and you lost. Thats not really on Disney for you to make the choice of using your trail days. Id say, Xbox gets hacked, you dont message Microsoft saying i want an extra 3 days on my Xbox gold/live so there seems to be a misunderstanding. Why are users doing it to X &amp; not Y? Its either both or none, not pick and choose. 3) they should have known about X No. You can speculate, but no. You can try as hard as you want to predict the future, but you cant. You can say well if the server has issues with 10 people in beta, then it wont be ready for 1M so they go back, fix to their best and retry. If they say okay, i _think_ that if this works for 100 people, it should work for 1,000 and thats not always the case. They tested it on a group, group game back successful, so you can _infer_ that this would work for more people. A different example is: if 10 people like the color red, then 1M should. No. You can speculate that, but unless you ask 1M people, you wont know. How do you fix a problem on Millions of people if you dont present it to the millions of people? It has to exist before you can see the problem areas. Laws work like this as well. You could speculate that having marijuana legal is going to lead to more crime but unless that policy exists, you wont know. You wont know that a law having more tax is going to hurt (CA) you wont know the full extent unless it exists. You can then go back and tweak it, but if you dont ask, you wont get an answer. If you dont roll it out, you wont know the risks and effects. Between these 3 arguments, people dont understand how things work at all. A new site will have problems. Its reasonable to assume that. These people didnt really take proper judgement and then complain why isnt it working? Its hard to tell someone that a lot of this issue is on you and NOT Disney. YOU used the same information, thats not Disneys fault. YOU knew that the platform is new and hasnt been updated yet. Its a little bit of Disneys fault for not making the platform stable quick enough, but YOU knew that it was going to be new and have risks/bugs to come with it. YOU saying they should have known.... is saying that the employees shouldve predicted the future. No one can predict the future accurately. It happens. I however didnt buy Disney+. I dont watch tv, but i also knew it was going to have Launch problems. Every company usually does. If you want to play the game of they shouldve known about X then you shouldve known that most companies have ALOT of problems within the first month. So why arent you to blame in your poor decision making and instead a companys employees are? Yes they need to fix it, but you knew the risks, or you should have known the risks, before handing money over to it. Sorry, this is all on you. Not the company."

Most forums already have a ""Report"" button, but I don't think it's enough of a deterrent. On the other hand, there are police cyber crime divisions irl, but that's for when shit has gotten so serious as to bleed into your real life. I think there needs to be something in the middle, some sort of law enforcement online that is more severe than just being suspended from one forum. Somehow, I think it has to *stick*. I don't have good proposals in mind though. Let me be clear: I'm all for privacy and keeping the internet free, but there's no real danger of losing that right now. In fact, I think things are a little too lassez faire on the internet at the moment. A little regulation will make the internet a safer place."

Their writing style is terrible and they sound like an AI saying ""X law bad."" I was hugely disappointed when Obama didn't get to sign a law that would have brought RICO into the CFAA and made members of hacker groups liable for every crime ever committed by that group simply for running a DDoS tool. I support DDoS being a felony. Saying it's ""a form of protest"" is like pointing a gun and someone and saying it's harmless protest because you didn't shoot anyone. I saw rotten, spoiled snot nosed kids complaining that they made themselves felons under DDoS law and they completely deserved it. They should be prohibited from using or owning a computer for the rest of their lives. That should be a law for any computer felon. Accessing a site with dox should be considered on par with accessing a child porn site and doing it once should result in loss of computer access for life, along with any other computer felony. In addition to adding anti doxxing statutes, we should beef up the CFAA to a mandatory 10 to life. We put rapists in prison for life and computer crime is digital rape. No apologies. Anyone who disagrees has obviously never dealt with a survivor of computer crime. I helped a group of people recover from doxxing several years ago and their information has been scrubbed from the internet and it wasn't even that bad all things considered, and they still have a lasting mental fog that has never gone away. I'm fucked up just from dealing with it. When you have to deal with pure evil in that kind of way, it changes you. Aaron Schwarz was not innocent. He was a self entitled marxist who hacked a computer network. I don't feel bad for all these ""researchers"" who are worried about ""muh chilling effect"" because they spoof their mac addresses. Spoofing a mac address is like grinding the serial number off of a military style assault rifle. Cyber attacks and online hate mobs are a bigger threat to free speech then any government could ever possibly hope to create. Computer criminals rank with drug cartel members and pedophiles and we need to start locking them up and throwing away the key."

(I'm not attacking a specific country or party, but Zuckerberg speaking to congress really showcased how uneducated some of these people are) With Fake News, Cyber Crime and many other digital threats in the world today, knowing the basics of how technology and social media works should be a requirement for being able to represent the country.

I can even say Ive fallen victim to it. However, some take it too far, and drive the victim to suicide. If this happens, the attacker needs more than just a slap on the wrist type of punishment. They need to be held more responsible. It needs to be a serious crime, like a felony. Normally, Im against making things felonies, but this is one of very few exceptions I will make. They need to face serious punishments, like, at minimum, a huge fine of 10000 USD, and at least, 10 years in prison, and even once they are released, they still need to be banned from use of social media for another 5 years. For a second time offender, they get double of what a first time offender gets, so a $20000 fine, 20 years in prison, and a 10 year social media ban. However, if someone offends this for a 3rd time, then give life in prison. The bottom line being, that cyber bullying needs to be taken more seriously, and there needs to be severe punishments put in place if the attacker drives their victim to suicide, and if it takes huge fines and imprisoning the attacker to stop them, than so be it.

I think if youre convicted and sentenced to death, it should be a relatively quick procedure. Fine, you can get an appeal to try and prove your innocence or earn a lighter sentencing, but if you fail that one appeal, I would say you have six months from the final sentencing. We live in a world where you dont have to wait for advancements in criminal justice technology. So theres no real reason to have these long drawn out things where they spend a decade in prison waiting for the appeal process to finally run out, living on taxpayer money. I say convict them of the crime, let them appeal it once, and then fry them as soon as possible. I also think that the death penalty should apply to so many more Crimes than just homicide or treason. I think pedophiles, rapists, repeat violent offenders and cyber terrorists should all get the chair as well. Also, and this is more of a voluntary option, but I think life sentence offenders should also be given an option for the death penalty. What kind of life is prison? How long can you honestly justify continuing on if your existence is a room the size of a broom closet and the constant threat of violence? This would be a pretty effective way of clearing out prisons, deincentivising serious crimes, and freeing up taxpayer money for better prisons and reform in the prison system. "

Other crime like theft, drug trafficing, etc have a huge risk from both law enforcement and gangs. But due to the way the internet works, there is little risk in cyber, especially if targetting non-extradition countries. Even if you get busted, you'd little jail time and you'll be able get a decent legal job because you have this experience. Unlike robbing someone at gunpoint, hacking takes a lot of skill and is a very intellectually fun field. There is both a legal side and an illegal side, and the skills transfer completely. Because of that you can be proud of your trade craft. Stuff like fraud isn't something that would transfer easily to a legit business. Furthermore, if you're an ethical kind of person, you can just target the rich and steal from them. This makes hacking more ethical than other forms of crime that harm regular people. I don't encourage anyone to commit crime, but from an objective standpoint, hacking is the best way to make money illegally. "
