1,cybercrime,Scams,Do not trust people online,1,higp2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/higp2v/do_not_trust_people_online/,2020-06-30 15:00:49,"I had made the mistake of seeking extramarital affairs, but only with the intention of cyber affairs and never wanting to go any further than that. From the website (which people say was legit), I had a woman who had shown interest in me. She had persisted on texting and asking for my number, but I was resilient at first. However, after she had sent me another photo of herself and she gave me a name, I caved. Then over text, she wanted to do more explicit photos and asked to see more. Of course, I did it without even realizing that they would in turn use it to immediately threaten me with sending everything to my wife (whose name and photos they had out of nowhere) unless I was complicit in sending them money in the form of online gift cards. I have since contacted my local police and ignored the person. Of course, I also had to come clean to my wife about this whole thing as to not have her safety jeopardized and its definitely put a strain on things. Someone suggested that I potentially contact the FBI and see if they can potentially launch a cybercrime investigation. Please tell me how I go about trying to fix this or if I can be okay by just ignoring them"
2,cybercrime,Scams,Scam on a freelance website,1,gljcc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/gljcc2/scam_on_a_freelance_website/,2020-05-18 03:23:39,"Hi, So I have a friend and she wanted to make some income during this daunting time to lessen the burden on her parents. However, there is this ""woman"" from the UK who happens to be a lawyer apparently asked her screenshots of [whatismyip.com](URL and she gave it (faceplam) and afterwards ""lawyer"" asked her to make accounts on Neteller and Skrill so that they can get 25gbp from her to prove that she is trustworthy to the ""system"" they have. Also, lawyer made her post a Healthy Life ad on Facebook which was approved by Facebook after review. Now, I told her to quit this because it is obviously a scam. That ""lawyer"" is now accusing her of cybercrime. As in, the fact that the lawyer made her open a Neteller and Skrill account means she is gambling online. Another thing is, lawyer also says the fact that she ran weight loss ads on Facebook is a crime. I am really not sure if that ""lawyer"" can sue this girl overseas for this? Obviously she is scammed. I know this so called lawyer's linkedin, twitter, facebook accounts by now. A quick reversal showed her workplace as well. They don't seem real, even if they are is it actually possible to sue this girl? What kind of horrible people are out there?? TLDR; my friend was on freelancer, was asked to make Neteller and Skrill accounts to pay 25gbp trust fee to the employer, was asked to run an ad called Healthy Life. Now that she wants to quit because it is sketchy, employer accused her of cybercrime because Neteller and Skrill are used for gambling (she doesn't do that) and she ran a weight loss ad on Facebook. However, Facebook approved the ad after review. Her freelance employer account is deleted when she told her that she will report her to the administration of the portal."

Out of fear, I contacted the police in case I was in danger. They said it was most likely a scam. I found it odd. Id expect scams to ask for money or some form of payment. Should I be concerned? Or am I just paranoid?"
5,cybercrime,Scams,/r/Scams Common Scam Master Post,1,g8k5lw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/g8k5lw/rscams_common_scam_master_post/,2020-04-27 05:00:01,"Hello visitors and subscribers of r/scams! Here you will find a master list of common (and uncommon) scams that you may encounter online or in real life. Thank you to the many contributors who helped create this thread! ##**If you know of a scam that is not covered here, write a comment and it will be added to the next edition.** Previous threads: URL **Blackmail email scam thread: URL Some of these articles are from small, local publications and refer to the scam happening in a specific area. **Do not** think that this means that the scam won't happen in your area. #Spoofing **[Caller ID spoofing](URL It is very easy for anyone to make a phone call while having any number show up on the caller ID of the person receiving the phone call. Receiving a phone call from a certain number does not mean that the person/company who owns that number has actually called you. **[Email spoofing](URL The ""from"" field of an email can be set by the sender, meaning that you can receive scam emails that look like they are from legitimate addresses. It's important to never click links in emails unless absolutely necessary, for example a password reset link you requested or an account activation link for an account you created. **[SMS spoofing](URL SMS messages can be spoofed, so be wary of messages that seem to be from your friends or other trusted people. #The most common scams **[The fake check scam](URL (Credit to /u/nimble2 for this part) The fake check scam arises from many different situations (for instance, you applied for a job, or you are selling something on a place like Craigslist, or someone wants to purchase goods or services from your business, or you were offered a job as a mystery shopper, you were asked to wrap your car with an advertisement, or you received a check in the mail for no reason), but the bottom line is always something like this: * The scammer sends you a very real looking, but fake, check. Sometimes they'll call it a ""cashier's check"", a ""certified check"", or a ""verified check"". * You deposit the check into your bank account, and within a couple of days your bank makes some or all of the funds available to you. This makes you think that the check is real and the funds have cleared. However, the money appearing in your account **is not** the same as the check actually clearing. The bank must make the funds available to you before they have cleared the check because that is the law. * For various and often complicated reasons, depending on the specific story line of the scam, the scammer will ask you to send someone some of the money, using services like MoneyGram, Western Union, and Walmart-2-Walmart. Sometimes the scammer will ask for you to purchase gift cards (iTunes, Amazon, Steam, etc) and give them the codes to redeem the gift cards. Some scammers may also give you instructions on how to buy and send them bitcoins. * Within a couple of weeks, though it can take as long as a month, your bank will realize that the check you deposited was fake, and your bank will remove the funds that you deposited into your account and charge you a bounced check fee. If you withdrew any of the money from the fake check, that money will be gone and you will owe that money to the bank. Some posters have even had their bank accounts closed and have been blocked from having another account for 5 years using ChexSystems. **General fraudulent funds scams** If somebody is asking you to accept and send out money as a favour or as part of a job, it is a fraudulent funds scam. It does not matter how they pay you, any payment on any service can be fraudulent and will be reversed when it is discovered to be fraudulent. **[Phone verification code scams](URL Someone will ask you to receive a verification text and then tell you to give them the code. Usually the code will come from Google Voice, or from Craigslist. In the Google version of the scam, your phone number will be used to verify a Google Voice account that the scammer will use to scam people with. In the Craigslist version of the scam, your phone number will be used to verify a Craigslist posting that the scammer will use to scam people. There is also an account takeover version of this scam that will involve the scammer sending a password reset token to your phone number and asking you for it. **Bitcoin job scams** Bitcoin job scams involve some sort of fraudulent funds transfer, usually a fake check although a fraudulent bank transfer can be used as well. The scammer will send you the fraudulent money and ask you to purchase bitcoins. This is a scam, and you will have zero recourse after you send the scammer bitcoins. **[Email flooding](URL If you suddenly receive hundreds or thousands of spam emails, usually subscription confirmations, it's very likely that one of your online accounts has been taken over and is being used fraudulently. You should check any of your accounts that has a credit card linked to it, preferably from a computer other than the one you normally use. You should change all of your passwords to unique passwords and you should start using two factor authentication everywhere. **[Boss/CEO scam](URL A scammer will impersonate your boss or someone who works at your company and will ask you to run an errand for them, which will usually be purchasing gift cards and sending them the code. Once the scammer has the code, you have no recourse. **Employment certification scams** You will receive a job offer that is dependent on you completing a course or receiving a certification from a company the scammer tells you about. The scammer operates both websites and the job does not exist. **Craigslist fake payment scams** Scammers will ask you about your item that you have listed for sale on a site like Craigslist, and will ask to pay you via Paypal. They are scamming you, and the payment in most cases does not actually exist, the email you received was sent by the scammers. In cases where you have received a payment, the scammer can dispute the payment or the payment may be entirely fraudulent. The scammer will then either try to get you to send money to them using the fake funds that they did not send to you, or will ask you to ship the item, usually to a re-shipping facility or a parcel mule. **General fraudulent funds scams** The fake check scam is not the only scam that involves accepting fraudulent/fake funds and purchasing items for scammers. If your job or opportunity involves accepting money and then using that money, it is almost certainly a frauduent funds scam. Even if the payment is through a bank transfer, Paypal, Venmo, Zelle, Interac e-Transfer, etc, it does not matter. **[Credit card debt scam](URL Fraudsters will offer to pay off your bills, and will do so with fraudulent funds. Sometimes it will be your credit card bill, but it can be any bill that can be paid online. Once they pay it off, they will ask you to send them money or purchase items for them. The fraudulent transaction will be reversed in the future and you will never be able to keep the money. This scam happens on sites like Craigslist, Twitter, Instagram, and also some dating sites, including SeekingArrangement. **[The parcel mule scam](URL A scammer will contact you with a job opportunity that involves accepting and reshipping packages. The packages are either stolen or fraudulently obtained items, and you will not be paid by the scammer. [Here](URL is a news article about a scam victim who fell for this scam and reshipped over 20 packages containing fraudulently acquired goods. **[The Skype sex scam](URL You're on Facebook and you get a friend request from a cute girl you've never met. She wants to start sexting and trading nudes. She'll ask you to send pictures or videos or get on webcam where she can see you naked with your face in the picture. The scam: There's no girl. You've sent nudes to a guy pretending to be a girl. As soon as he has the pictures he'll demand money and threaten to send the pictures to your friends and family. Sometimes the scammer will upload the video to a porn site or Youtube to show that they are serious. What to do if you are a victim of this scam: You cannot buy silence, you can only rent it. Paying the blackmailer will show them that the information they have is valuable and they will come after you for more money. Let your friends and family know that you were scammed and tell them to ignore friend requests or messages from people they don't know. Also, make sure your privacy settings are locked down and consider deactivating your account. **[The underage girl scam](URL You're on a dating site or app and you get contacted by a cute girl. She wants to start sexting and trading nudes. Eventually she stops communicating and you get a call from a pissed off guy claiming to be the girl's father, or a police officer, or a private investigator, or something else along those lines. Turns out the girl you were sexting is underage, and her parents want some money for various reasons, such as to pay for a new phone, to pay for therapy, etc. There is, of course, no girl. You were communicating with a scammer. What to do if you are a victim of this scam: Stop picking up the phone when the scammers call. Do not pay them, or they will be after you for more money. **[Phishing](URL Phishing is when a scammer tries to trick you into giving information to them, such as your password or private financial information. Phishing messages will usually look very similar to official messages, and sometimes they are identical. If you are ever required to login to a different account in order to use a service, you should be incredibly cautious. **[The blackmail email scam](URL The exact wording of the emails varies, but there are generally four main parts. They claim to have placed software/malware on a porn/adult video site, they claim to have a video of you masturbating or watching porn, they threaten to release the video to your friends/family/loved ones/boss/dog, and they demand that you pay them in order for them to delete the video. Rest assured that this is a very common spam campaign and there is no truth behind the email or the threats. [Here](URL are [some](URL news [articles](URL about [this](URL scam. **[The blackmail mail scam](URL This is very similar to the blackmail email scam, but you will receive a letter in the mail. **[Rental scams](URL Usually on local sites like Craigslist, scammers will steal photos from legitimate real estate listings and will list them for rent at or below market rate. They will generally be hesitant to tell you the address of the property for ""safety reasons"" and you will not be able to see the unit. They will then ask you to pay them a deposit and they claim they will ship you the keys. In reality, your money is gone and you will have no recourse. **[Craigslist vehicle scams](URL A scammer will list a vehicle on Craigslist and will offer to ship you the car. In many cases they will also falsely claim to sell you the car through eBay or Amazon. If you are looking for a car on Craigslist and the seller says anything about shipping the car, having an agent, gives you a long story about why they are selling the car, or the listing price is far too low, you are talking to a scammer and you should ignore and move on. **[Advance-fee scam](URL also known as the 419 scam, or the Nigerian prince scam. You will receive a communication from someone who claims that you are entitled to a large sum of money, or you can help them obtain a large sum of money. However, they will need money from you before you receive the large sum. **[Man in the middle scams](URL Man in the middle scams are very common and very hard to detect. The scammer will impersonate a company or person you are legitimately doing business with, and they will ask you to send the money to one of their own bank accounts or one controlled by a money mule. They have gained access to the legitimate persons email address, so there will be nothing suspicious about the email. To prevent this, make contact in a different way that lets you verify that the person you are talking to is the person you think you are talking to. **[Cam girl voting/viewer scam](URL You will encounter a ""cam girl"" on a dating/messaging/social media/whatever site/app, and the scammer will ask you to go to their site and sign up with your credit card. They may offer a free show, or ask you to vote for them, or any number of other fake stories. **[Amateur porn recruitment scam](URL You will encounter a ""pornstar"" on a dating/messaging/social media/whatever site/app, and the scammer will ask you to create an adult film with her/him, but first you need to do something. The story here is usually something to do with verifying your age, or you needing to take an STD test that involves sending money to a site operated by the scammer. **Hot girl SMS spam** You receive a text from a random number with a message along the lines of ""Hey babe I'm here in town again if you wanted to meet up this time, are you around?"" accompanied by a NSFW picture of a hot girl. It's spam, and they'll direct you to their scam website that requires a credit card. **[Identity verification scam](URL You will encounter someone on a dating/messaging/social media/whatever site/app, and the scammer will ask that you verify your identity as they are worried about catfishing. The scammer operates the site, and you are not talking to whoever you think you are talking to. This type of scam teases you with something, then tries to make you sign up for something else that costs money. The company involved is often innocent, but they turn a blind eye to the practice as it helps their bottom line, even if they have to occasionally issue refunds. A common variation takes place on dating sites/dating apps, where you will match with someone who claims to be a camgirl who wants you to sign up for a site and vote for her. Another variation takes place on local sites like Craigslist, where the scammers setup fake rental scams and demand that you go through a specific service for a credit check. Once you go through with it, the scammer will stop talking to you. Another variation also takes place on local sites like Craigslist, where scammers will contact you while you are selling a car and will ask you to purchase a Carfax-like report from a specific website. **[Multi Level Marketing or Affiliate Marketing](URL You apply for a vague job listing for 'sales' on craigslist. Or maybe an old friend from high school adds you on Facebook and says they have an amazing business opportunity for you. Or maybe the well dressed guy who's always interviewing people in the Starbucks that you work at asks if you really want to be slinging coffee the rest of your life. The scam: MLMs are little more than pyramid schemes. They involve buying some sort of product (usually snake oil health products like body wraps or supplements) and shilling them to your friends and family. They claim that the really money is recruiting people underneath you who give you a slice of whatever they sell. And if those people underneath you recruit more people, you get a piece of their sales. Ideally if you big enough pyramid underneath you the money will roll in without any work on your part. Failure to see any profit will be your fault for not ""wanting it enough."" The companies will claim that you need to buy their extra training modules or webinars to really start selling. But in reality, the vast majority of people who buy into a MLM won't see a cent. At the end of the day all you'll be doing is annoying your friends and family with your constant recruitment efforts. What to look out for: Recruiters love to be vague. They won't tell you the name of the company or what exactly the job will entail. They'll pump you up with promises of ""self-generating income"", ""being your own boss"", and ""owning your own company."" They might ask you to read books about success and entrepreneurs. They're hoping you buy into the dream first. If you get approached via social media, check their timelines. MLMs will often instruct their victims to pretend that they've already made it. They'll constantly post about how they're hustling and making the big bucks and linking to youtube videos about success. Again, all very vague about what their job actually entails. If you think you're being recruited: Ask them what exactly the job is. If they can't answer its probably a MLM. Just walk away. ##**Phone scams** You should generally avoid answering or engaging with random phone calls. Picking up and engaging with a scam call tells the scammers that your phone number is active, and will usually lead to more calls. **Tax Call** You get a call from somebody claiming to be from your countries tax agency. They say you have unpaid taxes that need to be paid immediately, and you may be arrested or have other legal action taken against you if it is not paid. This scam has caused the [American IRS](URL [Canadian CRA](URL [British HMRC](URL and [Australian Tax Office](URL to issue warnings. This scam happens in a wide variety of countries all over the world. **[Warrant Call](URL Very similar to the tax call. You'll get a phone call from an ""agent"", ""officer"", ""sheriff"", or other law enforcement officer claiming that there is a warrant out for your arrest and you will be arrested very soon. They will then offer to settle everything for a fee, usually paid in giftcards. **[Legal Documents/Process Server Calls]** Very similar to the warrant call. You'll get a phone call from a scammer claiming that they are going to serve you legal documents, and they will threaten you with legal consequences if you refuse to comply. They may call themselves ""investigators"", and will sometimes give you a fake case number. **[Student Loan Forgiveness Scam](URL Scammers will call you and tell you about a student loan forgiveness program, but they are interested in obtaining private information about you or demanding money in order to join the fake program. **[Tech Support Call](URL You receive a call from someone with a heavy accent claiming to be a technician Microsoft or your ISP. They inform you that your PC has a virus and your online banking and other accounts may be compromised if the virus is not removed. They'll have you type in commands and view diagnostics on your PC which shows proof of the virus. Then they'll have you install remote support software so the technician can work on your PC, remove the virus, and install security software. The cost of the labor and software can be hundreds of dollars. The scam: There's no virus. The technician isn't a technician and does not work for Microsoft or your ISP. Scammers (primarily out of India) use autodialers to cold-call everyone in the US. Any file they point out to you or command they have you run is completely benign. The software they sell you is either freeware or ineffective. What to do you if you're involved with this scam: If the scammers are remotely on your computer as you read this, turn off your PC or laptop via the power button immediately, and then if possible unplug your internet connection. Some of the more vindictive tech scammers have been known to create boot passwords on your computer if they think you've become wise to them and aren't going to pay up. Hang up on the scammers, block the number, and ignore any threats about payment. Performing a system restore on your PC is usually all that is required to remove the scammer's common remote access software. Reports of identity theft from fake tech calls are uncommon, but it would still be a good idea to change your passwords for online banking and monitor your accounts for any possible fraud. How to avoid: Ignore any calls claiming that your PC has a virus. Microsoft will never contact you. If you're unsure if a call claiming to be from your ISP is legit, hang up, and then dial the customer support number listed on a recent bill. If you have elderly relatives or family that isn't tech savvy, take the time to fill them in on this scam. **[Chinese government scam](URL This scam is aimed at Chinese people living in Europe and North America, and involves a voicemail from someone claiming to be associated with the Chinese government, usually through the Chinese consulate/embassy, who is threatening legal action or making general threats. **[Chinese shipping scam](URL This scam is similar to the Chinese government scam, but involves a seized/suspicious package, and the scammers will connect the victim to other scammers posing as Chinese government investigators. **[Social security suspension scam](URL You will receive a call from someone claiming to work for the government regarding suspicious activity, fraud, or serious crimes connected to your social security number. You'll be asked to speak to an operator and the operator will explain the steps you need to follow in order to fix the problems. It's all a scam, and will lead to you losing money and could lead to identity theft if you give them private financial information. **Utilities cutoff** You get a call from someone who claims that they are from your utility company, and they claim that your utilities will be shut off unless you immediately pay. The scammer will usually ask for payment via gift cards, although they may ask for payment in other ways, such as Western Union or bitcoin. **[Relative in custody](URL Scammer claims to be the police, and they have your son/daughter/nephew/estranged twin in custody. You need to post bail (for some reason in iTunes gift cards or MoneyGram) immediately or the *consequences will never be the same*. **[Mexican family scam](URL This scam comes in many different flavours, but always involves someone in your family and Mexico. Sometimes the scammer will claim that your family member has been detained, sometimes the scammer will claim that your family member has been kidnapped, and sometimes the scammer will claim that your family member is injured and needs help. **General family scams** Scammers will gather a large amount of information about you and target your family members using different stories with the goal of gettimg them to send money. **[One ring scam](URL Scammers will call you from an international number with the goal of getting you to return their call, causing you to incur expensive calling fees. ##**Online shopping scams** **THE GOLDEN RULE OF ONLINE SHOPPING: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.** **Dropshipping** An ad on reddit or social media sites like Facebook and Instagram offers items at huge discounts or even free (sometimes requiring you to reblog or like their page). They just ask you to pay shipping. The scam: The item will turn out to be very low quality and will take weeks or even months to arrive. Sometimes the item never arrives, and the store disappears or stops responding. The seller drop-ships the item from China. The item may only cost a few dollars, and the Chinese government actually pays for the shipping. You end up paying $10-$15 dollars for a $4 item, with the scammer keeping the profit. If you find one of these scams but really have your heart set on the item, you can find it on AliExpress or another Chinese retailer. **[Influencer scams](URL A user will reach out to you on a social media platform, usually Instagram, and offer you the chance to partner with them and receive a free/discounted product, as long as you pay shipping. This is a different version of the dropshipping scam, and is just a marketing technique to get you to buy their products. **[Triangulation fraud](URL Triangulation fraud occurs when you make a purchase on a site like Amazon or eBay for an item at a lower than market price, and receive an item that was clearly purchased new at full price. The scammer uses a stolen credit card to order your item, while the money from the listing is almost all profit for the scammer. **Instagram influencer scams** Someone will message you on Instagram asking you to promote their products, and offering you a discount code. The items are Chinese junk, and the offer is made to many people at a time. **Cheap Items** Many websites pop up and offer expensive products, including electronics, clothes, watches, sunglasses, and shoes at very low prices. The scam: Some sites are selling cheap knock-offs. Some will just take your money and run. What to do if you think you're involved with this scam: Contact your bank or credit card and dispute the charge. How to avoid: The sites often have every brand-name shoe or fashion item (Air Jordan, Yeezy, Gucci, etc) in stock and often at a discounted price. The site will claim to be an outlet for a major brand or even a specific line or item. The site will have images at the bottom claiming to be Secured by Norton or various official payment processors but not actual links. The site will have poor grammar and a mish-mash of categories. Recently, established websites will get hacked or their domain name jacked and turned into scam stores, meaning the domain name of the store will be completely unrelated to the items they're selling. If the deal sounds too good to be true it probably is. Nobody is offering brand new iPhones or Beats or Nintendo Switches for 75% off. **[Cheap Amazon 3rd Party Items](URL You're on Amazon or maybe just Googling for an item and you see it for an unbelievable price from a third-party seller. You know Amazon has your back so you order it. The scam: One of three things usually happen: 1) The seller marks the items as shipped and sends a fake tracking number. Amazon releases the funds to the seller, and the seller disappears. Amazon ultimately refunds your money. 2) The seller immediately cancels the order and instructs you to re-order the item directly from their website, usually with the guarantee that the order is still protected by Amazon. The seller takes your money and runs. Amazon informs you that they do not offer protection on items sold outside of Amazon and cannot help you. 2) The seller immediately cancels the order and instructs you to instead send payment via an unused Amazon gift card by sending the code on the back via email. Once the seller uses the code, the money on the card is gone and cannot be refunded. How to avoid: These scammers can be identified by looking at their Amazon storefronts. They'll be brand new sellers offering a wide range of items at unbelievable prices. Usually their Amazon names will be gibberish, or a variation on FIRSTNAME.LASTNAME. Occasionally however, established storefronts will be hacked. If the deal is too good to be true its most likely a scam. **Scams on eBay** There are scams on eBay targeting both buyers and sellers. As a seller, you should look out for people who privately message you regarding the order, especially if they ask you to ship to a different address or ask to negotiate via text/email/a messaging service. As a buyer you should look out for new accounts selling in-demand items, established accounts selling in-demand items that they have no previous connection to (you can check their feedback history for a general idea of what they bought/sold in the past), and lookout for people who ask you to go off eBay and use another service to complete the transaction. In many cases you will receive a fake tracking number and your money will be help up for up to a month. **Scams on Amazon** There are scams on Amazon targeting both buyers and sellers. As a seller, you should look out for people who message you about a listing. As a buyer you should look out for listings that have an email address for you to contact the person to complete the transaction, and you should look out for cheap listings of in-demand items. **Scams on Reddit** Reddit accounts are frequently purchased and sold by fraudsters who wish to use the high karma count + the age of the account to scam people on buy/sell subreddits. You need to take precautions and be safe whenever you are making a transaction online. **Computer scams** **[Virus scam](URL A popup or other ad will say that you have a virus and you need to follow their advice in order to remove it. They are lying, and either want you to install malware or pay for their software. ##**Assorted scams** **[Chinese Brushing / direct shipping](URL If you have ever received an unsolicited small package from China, your address was used to [brush](URL Vendors place fake orders for their own products and send out the orders so that they can increase their ratings. **[Money flipping](URL Scammer claims to be a banking insider who can double/triple/bazoople any amount of money you send them, with no consequences of any kind. Obviously, the money disappears into their wallet the moment you send it. ##**Door to door scams** **As a general rule, you should not engage with door to door salesmen. If you are interested in the product they are selling, check online first.** **[Selling Magazines](URL Someone or a group will come to your door and offer to sell a magazine subscription. Often the subscriptions are not for the duration or price you were told, and the magazines will often have tough or impossible cancellation policies. **[Energy sales](URL Somebody will come to your door claiming to be from an energy company. They will ask to see your current energy bill so that they can see how much you pay. They will then offer you a discount if you sign up with them, and promise to handle everything with your old provider. Some of these scammers will ""slam"" you, by using your account number that they saw on your bill to switch you to their service without authorization, and some will scam you by charging higher prices than the ones you agreed on. **[Security system scams](URL Scammers will come to your door and ask about your security system, and offer to sell you a new one. These scammers are either selling you overpriced low quality products, or are casing your home for a future burglary. **They ask to enter your home** While trying to sell you whatever, they suddenly need to use your bathroom, or they've been writing against the wall and ask to use your table instead. Or maybe they just moved into the neighborhood and want to see how you decorate for ideas. They're scoping out you and your place. They want to see what valuables you have, how gullible you are, if you have a security system or dogs, etc. ##**Street scams** **[Begging With a Purpose](URL ""I just need a few more dollars for the bus,"" at the bus station, or ""I just need $5 to get some gas,"" at a gas station. There's also a variation where you will be presented with a reward: ""I just need money for a cab to get uptown, but I'll give you sports tickets/money/a date/a priceless vase."" **[Three Card Monte, Also Known As The Shell Game](URL Unbeatable. The people you see winning are in on the scam. **[Drop and Break](URL You bump into someone and they drop their phone/glasses/fancy bottle of wine/priceless vase and demand you pay them back. In reality, it's a $2 pair of reading glasses/bottle of three-buck-chuck/tasteful but affordable vase. **[CD Sales](URL You're handed a free CD so you can check out the artist's music. They then ask for your name and immediately write it on the CD. Once they've signed your name, they ask you for money, saying they can't give it to someone else now. Often they use dry erase markers, or cheap CD sleeves. Never use any type of storage device given to you by a random person, as the device can contain malware. **[White Van Speaker Scam](URL You're approached and offered speakers/leather jackets/other luxury goods at a discount. The scammer will have an excuse as to why the price is so low. After you buy them, you'll discover that they are worthless. **[iPhone Street Sale](URL You're approached and shown an iPhone for sale, coming in the box, but it's open and you can see the phone. If you buy the phone, you'll get an iPhone box with no iPhone, just some stones or cheap metal in it to weigh it down. **[Buddhist Monk Pendant](URL A monk in traditional garb approaches you, hands you a gold trinket, and asks for a donation. He holds either a notebook with names and amounts of donation (usually everyone else has donated $5+), or a leaflet with generic info. This is fairly common in NYC, and these guys get aggressive quickly. **[Friendship Bracelet Scam](URL More common in western Europe, you're approached by someone selling bracelets. They quickly wrap a loop of fabric around your finger and pull it tight, starting to quickly weave a bracelet. The only way to (easily) get it off your hand is to pay. **Leftover sales** This scam involves many different items, but the idea is usually the same: you are approached by someone who claims to have a large amount of excess inventory and offers to sell it to you at a great price. The scammer actually has low quality items and will lie to you about the price/origin of the items. **[Dent repair scams](URL Scammers will approach you in public about a dent in your car and offer to fix it for a low price. Often they will claim that they are mechanics. They will not fix the dent in your car, but they will apply large amounts of wax or other substances to hide the dent while they claim that the substance requires time to harden. **[Gold ring/jewelry/valuable item scam](URL A scammer will ""find"" a gold ring or other valuable item and offers to sell it to you. The item is fake and you will never see the scammer again. **[Distraction theft](URL One person will approach you and distract you, while their accomplice picks your pockets. The distraction can take many forms, but if you are a tourist and are approached in public, watch closely for people getting close to you. ##General resources## Site to report scams in the United Kingdom: URL Site to report scams in the United States: URL Site to report scams in Canada: URL Site to report scams in Europe: URL FTC scam alerts: URL Microsoft's anti-scam guide: URL URL URL URL URL"

9,cybercrime,Scams,Port-Out Scam,1,fbpv89,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/fbpv89/portout_scam/,2020-03-01 16:58:41,"Today I just became the victim to a port-out scam. This morning, I got a text from my phone service provider saying they've received a request to transfer my telephone number to another service provider. Since I have received numerous scam texts impersonating my carrier in the past, I thought nothing of it, since I figured, oh! If someone's going to transfer my phone to another carrier, I've got to at least receive a call or a legit email from carrier, right? Wrong. Apparently all it took for them to gain access to my phone is my full name, address, and postal code (I spoke to 2 customer service reps from my carrier today, both of whom relied on that bit of info to authenticate me). If I don't contact the carrier and say, ""I have a problem with you changing my carrier info!"", then the change is going to take place pretty much immediately. From there, by taking over my phone number, the scammer gained access to my email and online banking. They first hooked up my account with Western Union (why does it always have to be western union smh) and transferred a sum of around $1000 CAD. They found a recipient listed in my online banking that has my email, which they then sent the remaining funds on my account to. They logged onto my email, used that link to deposit money into their account (it's a lot of money). I woke up around the time they were just finishing up and managed to cancel one transaction. I also got in touch with my bank's cybercrime investigation service within the hour of the deposit. I am currently using one of the biggest phone service providers in Canada, and it is truly disappointing that their lack of authentication competence has caused their customers to be targeted, their personal information compromised, and is somehow generating income for criminals."
10,cybercrime,Scams,Romance scam - worth telling the police?,2,dsif8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/dsif8g/romance_scam_worth_telling_the_police/,2019-11-07 03:10:04,"Hello guys, I got in contact with a girl claiming to be from Eastern Europe. In her first message she even informed me about scammers, so I went for it and asked for a proof. She then sent me a short video of herself speaking Russian. I couldn't understand anything beside my name, so the video seems legitimate. I got curious, because I always thought that scammers avoid video chats and can't provide legitimate proofs as the pictures they use are stolen somewhere and they won't ever get a video with that person proving anything. (I know they sometimes use unrelated pre-recorded videos and then claim to have technical problems). Her mails have all the obvious signs of romance scam. Beautiful girl, many pictures in each mail, sad story and a lot of text. She has very good English skills, but her style is totally different from any other Eastern European women I know. She claims she never left her country, so it's unlikely she learnd it by being abroad for some time. Either way, I checked the IPs from where the mails where sent out. It's almost always an VPN endpoint in her alleged country. But the mail with the short video had an IP from a Western European country. So the video must somehow really show the person trying to scam. Or she at least works as an endless source of beautiful pictures and perfectly faked proofs, while others do the tedious work. Now taking into account, that this person might be real and is somehow involed in a scam and that she maybe unintentionally revealed her real IP... is it worth reporting it somewhere? I haven't lost any money, so no crime was commited so far. I could contact her ISP if there is already some investigation going on or ask some European cybercrime unit, but I don't want to get involed deeply in any juridical stuff. I could simply confront her with my findings, but that would only help them to improve their tactics. What would you do?"
11,cybercrime,Scams,/r/Scams Common Scam Master Post,5,doh6kd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/doh6kd/rscams_common_scam_master_post/,2019-10-29 10:12:56,"Hello visitors and subscribers of r/scams! Here you will find a master list of common (and uncommon) scams that you may encounter online or in real life. Thank you to the many contributors who helped create this thread! ##**If you know of a scam that is not covered here, write a comment and it will be added to the next edition.** Previous threads: URL Some of these articles are from small, local publications and refer to the scam happening in a specific area. **Do not** think that this means that the scam won't happen in your area. #Spoofing **[Caller ID spoofing](URL It is very easy for anyone to make a phone call while having any number show up on the caller ID of the person receiving the phone call. Receiving a phone call from a certain number does not mean that the person/company who owns that number has actually called you. **[Email spoofing](URL The ""from"" field of an email can be set by the sender, meaning that you can receive scam emails that look like they are from legitimate addresses. It's important to never click links in emails unless absolutely necessary, for example a password reset link you requested or an account activation link for an account you created. **[SMS spoofing](URL SMS messages can be spoofed, so be wary of messages that seem to be from your friends or other trusted people. #The most common scams **[The fake check scam](URL (Credit to /u/nimble2 for this part) The fake check scam arises from many different situations (for instance, you applied for a job, or you are selling something on a place like Craigslist, or someone wants to purchase goods or services from your business, or you were offered a job as a mystery shopper, you were asked to wrap your car with an advertisement, or you received a check in the mail for no reason), but the bottom line is always something like this: * The scammer sends you a very real looking, but fake, check. Sometimes they'll call it a ""cashier's check"", a ""certified check"", or a ""verified check"". * You deposit the check into your bank account, and within a couple of days your bank makes some or all of the funds available to you. This makes you think that the check is real and the funds have cleared. However, the money appearing in your account **is not** the same as the check actually clearing. The bank must make the funds available to you before they have cleared the check because that is the law. * For various and often complicated reasons, depending on the specific story line of the scam, the scammer will ask you to send someone some of the money, using services like MoneyGram, Western Union, and Walmart-2-Walmart. Sometimes the scammer will ask for you to purchase gift cards (iTunes, Amazon, Steam, etc) and give them the codes to redeem the gift cards. Some scammers may also give you instructions on how to buy and send them bitcoins. * Within a couple of weeks, though it can take as long as a month, your bank will realize that the check you deposited was fake, and your bank will remove the funds that you deposited into your account and charge you a bounced check fee. If you withdrew any of the money from the fake check, that money will be gone and you will owe that money to the bank. Some posters have even had their bank accounts closed and have been blocked from having another account for 5 years using ChexSystems. **General fraudulent funds scams** If somebody is asking you to accept and send out money as a favour or as part of a job, it is a fraudulent funds scam. It does not matter how they pay you, any payment on any service can be fraudulent and will be reversed when it is discovered to be fraudulent. **[Phone verification code scams](URL Someone will ask you to receive a verification text and then tell you to give them the code. Usually the code will come from Google Voice, or from Craigslist. In the Google version of the scam, your phone number will be used to verify a Google Voice account that the scammer will use to scam people with. In the Craigslist version of the scam, your phone number will be used to verify a Craigslist posting that the scammer will use to scam people. There is also an account takeover version of this scam that will involve the scammer sending a password reset token to your phone number and asking you for it. **Bitcoin job scams** Bitcoin job scams involve some sort of fraudulent funds transfer, usually a fake check although a fraudulent bank transfer can be used as well. The scammer will send you the fraudulent money and ask you to purchase bitcoins. This is a scam, and you will have zero recourse after you send the scammer bitcoins. **[Email flooding](URL If you suddenly receive hundreds or thousands of spam emails, usually subscription confirmations, it's very likely that one of your online accounts has been taken over and is being used fraudulently. You should check any of your accounts that has a credit card linked to it, preferably from a computer other than the one you normally use. You should change all of your passwords to unique passwords and you should start using two factor authentication everywhere. **[Boss/CEO scam](URL A scammer will impersonate your boss or someone who works at your company and will ask you to run an errand for them, which will usually be purchasing gift cards and sending them the code. Once the scammer has the code, you have no recourse. **Employment certification scams** You will receive a job offer that is dependent on you completing a course or receiving a certification from a company the scammer tells you about. The scammer operates both websites and the job does not exist. **Craigslist fake payment scams** Scammers will ask you about your item that you have listed for sale on a site like Craigslist, and will ask to pay you via Paypal. They are scamming you, and the payment in most cases does not actually exist, the email you received was sent by the scammers. In cases where you have received a payment, the scammer can dispute the payment or the payment may be entirely fraudulent. The scammer will then either try to get you to send money to them using the fake funds that they did not send to you, or will ask you to ship the item, usually to a re-shipping facility or a parcel mule. **General fraudulent funds scams** The fake check scam is not the only scam that involves accepting fraudulent/fake funds and purchasing items for scammers. If your job or opportunity involves accepting money and then using that money, it is almost certainly a frauduent funds scam. Even if the payment is through a bank transfer, Paypal, Venmo, Zelle, Interac e-Transfer, etc, it does not matter. **[Credit card debt scam](URL Fraudsters will offer to pay off your bills, and will do so with fraudulent funds. Sometimes it will be your credit card bill, but it can be any bill that can be paid online. Once they pay it off, they will ask you to send them money or purchase items for them. The fraudulent transaction will be reversed in the future and you will never be able to keep the money. This scam happens on sites like Craigslist, Twitter, Instagram, and also some dating sites, including SeekingArrangement. **[The parcel mule scam](URL A scammer will contact you with a job opportunity that involves accepting and reshipping packages. The packages are either stolen or fraudulently obtained items, and you will not be paid by the scammer. [Here](URL is a news article about a scam victim who fell for this scam and reshipped over 20 packages containing fraudulently acquired goods. **[The Skype sex scam](URL You're on Facebook and you get a friend request from a cute girl you've never met. She wants to start sexting and trading nudes. She'll ask you to send pictures or videos or get on webcam where she can see you naked with your face in the picture. The scam: There's no girl. You've sent nudes to a guy pretending to be a girl. As soon as he has the pictures he'll demand money and threaten to send the pictures to your friends and family. Sometimes the scammer will upload the video to a porn site or Youtube to show that they are serious. What to do if you are a victim of this scam: You cannot buy silence, you can only rent it. Paying the blackmailer will show them that the information they have is valuable and they will come after you for more money. Let your friends and family know that you were scammed and tell them to ignore friend requests or messages from people they don't know. Also, make sure your privacy settings are locked down and consider deactivating your account. **[The underage girl scam](URL You're on a dating site or app and you get contacted by a cute girl. She wants to start sexting and trading nudes. Eventually she stops communicating and you get a call from a pissed off guy claiming to be the girl's father, or a police officer, or a private investigator, or something else along those lines. Turns out the girl you were sexting is underage, and her parents want some money for various reasons, such as to pay for a new phone, to pay for therapy, etc. There is, of course, no girl. You were communicating with a scammer. What to do if you are a victim of this scam: Stop picking up the phone when the scammers call. Do not pay them, or they will be after you for more money. **[Phishing](URL Phishing is when a scammer tries to trick you into giving information to them, such as your password or private financial information. Phishing messages will usually look very similar to official messages, and sometimes they are identical. If you are ever required to login to a different account in order to use a service, you should be incredibly cautious. **[The blackmail email scam](URL The exact wording of the emails varies, but there are generally four main parts. They claim to have placed software/malware on a porn/adult video site, they claim to have a video of you masturbating or watching porn, they threaten to release the video to your friends/family/loved ones/boss/dog, and they demand that you pay them in order for them to delete the video. Rest assured that this is a very common spam campaign and there is no truth behind the email or the threats. [Here](URL are [some](URL news [articles](URL about [this](URL scam. **[The blackmail mail scam](URL This is very similar to the blackmail email scam, but you will receive a letter in the mail. **[Rental scams](URL Usually on local sites like Craigslist, scammers will steal photos from legitimate real estate listings and will list them for rent at or below market rate. They will generally be hesitant to tell you the address of the property for ""safety reasons"" and you will not be able to see the unit. They will then ask you to pay them a deposit and they claim they will ship you the keys. In reality, your money is gone and you will have no recourse. **[Craigslist vehicle scams](URL A scammer will list a vehicle on Craigslist and will offer to ship you the car. In many cases they will also falsely claim to sell you the car through eBay or Amazon. If you are looking for a car on Craigslist and the seller says anything about shipping the car, having an agent, gives you a long story about why they are selling the car, or the listing price is far too low, you are talking to a scammer and you should ignore and move on. **[Advance-fee scam](URL also known as the 419 scam, or the Nigerian prince scam. You will receive a communication from someone who claims that you are entitled to a large sum of money, or you can help them obtain a large sum of money. However, they will need money from you before you receive the large sum. **[Man in the middle scams](URL Man in the middle scams are very common and very hard to detect. The scammer will impersonate a company or person you are legitimately doing business with, and they will ask you to send the money to one of their own bank accounts or one controlled by a money mule. They have gained access to the legitimate persons email address, so there will be nothing suspicious about the email. To prevent this, make contact in a different way that lets you verify that the person you are talking to is the person you think you are talking to. **[Cam girl voting/viewer scam](URL You will encounter a ""cam girl"" on a dating/messaging/social media/whatever site/app, and the scammer will ask you to go to their site and sign up with your credit card. They may offer a free show, or ask you to vote for them, or any number of other fake stories. **[Amateur porn recruitment scam](URL You will encounter a ""pornstar"" on a dating/messaging/social media/whatever site/app, and the scammer will ask you to create an adult film with her/him, but first you need to do something. The story here is usually something to do with verifying your age, or you needing to take an STD test that involves sending money to a site operated by the scammer. **Hot girl SMS spam** You receive a text from a random number with a message along the lines of ""Hey babe I'm here in town again if you wanted to meet up this time, are you around?"" accompanied by a NSFW picture of a hot girl. It's spam, and they'll direct you to their scam website that requires a credit card. **[Identity verification scam](URL You will encounter someone on a dating/messaging/social media/whatever site/app, and the scammer will ask that you verify your identity as they are worried about catfishing. The scammer operates the site, and you are not talking to whoever you think you are talking to. This type of scam teases you with something, then tries to make you sign up for something else that costs money. The company involved is often innocent, but they turn a blind eye to the practice as it helps their bottom line, even if they have to occasionally issue refunds. A common variation takes place on dating sites/dating apps, where you will match with someone who claims to be a camgirl who wants you to sign up for a site and vote for her. Another variation takes place on local sites like Craigslist, where the scammers setup fake rental scams and demand that you go through a specific service for a credit check. Once you go through with it, the scammer will stop talking to you. Another variation also takes place on local sites like Craigslist, where scammers will contact you while you are selling a car and will ask you to purchase a Carfax-like report from a specific website. **[Multi Level Marketing or Affiliate Marketing](URL You apply for a vague job listing for 'sales' on craigslist. Or maybe an old friend from high school adds you on Facebook and says they have an amazing business opportunity for you. Or maybe the well dressed guy who's always interviewing people in the Starbucks that you work at asks if you really want to be slinging coffee the rest of your life. The scam: MLMs are little more than pyramid schemes. They involve buying some sort of product (usually snake oil health products like body wraps or supplements) and shilling them to your friends and family. They claim that the really money is recruiting people underneath you who give you a slice of whatever they sell. And if those people underneath you recruit more people, you get a piece of their sales. Ideally if you big enough pyramid underneath you the money will roll in without any work on your part. Failure to see any profit will be your fault for not ""wanting it enough."" The companies will claim that you need to buy their extra training modules or webinars to really start selling. But in reality, the vast majority of people who buy into a MLM won't see a cent. At the end of the day all you'll be doing is annoying your friends and family with your constant recruitment efforts. What to look out for: Recruiters love to be vague. They won't tell you the name of the company or what exactly the job will entail. They'll pump you up with promises of ""self-generating income"", ""being your own boss"", and ""owning your own company."" They might ask you to read books about success and entrepreneurs. They're hoping you buy into the dream first. If you get approached via social media, check their timelines. MLMs will often instruct their victims to pretend that they've already made it. They'll constantly post about how they're hustling and making the big bucks and linking to youtube videos about success. Again, all very vague about what their job actually entails. If you think you're being recruited: Ask them what exactly the job is. If they can't answer its probably a MLM. Just walk away. ##**Phone scams** You should generally avoid answering or engaging with random phone calls. Picking up and engaging with a scam call tells the scammers that your phone number is active, and will usually lead to more calls. **Tax Call** You get a call from somebody claiming to be from your countries tax agency. They say you have unpaid taxes that need to be paid immediately, and you may be arrested or have other legal action taken against you if it is not paid. This scam has caused the [American IRS](URL [Canadian CRA](URL [British HMRC](URL and [Australian Tax Office](URL to issue warnings. This scam happens in a wide variety of countries all over the world. **[Warrant Call](URL Very similar to the tax call. You'll get a phone call from an ""agent"", ""officer"", ""sheriff"", or other law enforcement officer claiming that there is a warrant out for your arrest and you will be arrested very soon. They will then offer to settle everything for a fee, usually paid in giftcards. **[Legal Documents/Process Server Calls]** Very similar to the warrant call. You'll get a phone call from a scammer claiming that they are going to serve you legal documents, and they will threaten you with legal consequences if you refuse to comply. They may call themselves ""investigators"", and will sometimes give you a fake case number. **[Student Loan Forgiveness Scam](URL Scammers will call you and tell you about a student loan forgiveness program, but they are interested in obtaining private information about you or demanding money in order to join the fake program. **[Tech Support Call](URL You receive a call from someone with a heavy accent claiming to be a technician Microsoft or your ISP. They inform you that your PC has a virus and your online banking and other accounts may be compromised if the virus is not removed. They'll have you type in commands and view diagnostics on your PC which shows proof of the virus. Then they'll have you install remote support software so the technician can work on your PC, remove the virus, and install security software. The cost of the labor and software can be hundreds of dollars. The scam: There's no virus. The technician isn't a technician and does not work for Microsoft or your ISP. Scammers (primarily out of India) use autodialers to cold-call everyone in the US. Any file they point out to you or command they have you run is completely benign. The software they sell you is either freeware or ineffective. What to do you if you're involved with this scam: If the scammers are remotely on your computer as you read this, turn off your PC or laptop via the power button immediately, and then if possible unplug your internet connection. Some of the more vindictive tech scammers have been known to create boot passwords on your computer if they think you've become wise to them and aren't going to pay up. Hang up on the scammers, block the number, and ignore any threats about payment. Performing a system restore on your PC is usually all that is required to remove the scammer's common remote access software. Reports of identity theft from fake tech calls are uncommon, but it would still be a good idea to change your passwords for online banking and monitor your accounts for any possible fraud. How to avoid: Ignore any calls claiming that your PC has a virus. Microsoft will never contact you. If you're unsure if a call claiming to be from your ISP is legit, hang up, and then dial the customer support number listed on a recent bill. If you have elderly relatives or family that isn't tech savvy, take the time to fill them in on this scam. **[Chinese government scam](URL This scam is aimed at Chinese people living in Europe and North America, and involves a voicemail from someone claiming to be associated with the Chinese government, usually through the Chinese consulate/embassy, who is threatening legal action or making general threats. **[Chinese shipping scam](URL This scam is similar to the Chinese government scam, but involves a seized/suspicious package, and the scammers will connect the victim to other scammers posing as Chinese government investigators. **[Social security suspension scam](URL You will receive a call from someone claiming to work for the government regarding suspicious activity, fraud, or serious crimes connected to your social security number. You'll be asked to speak to an operator and the operator will explain the steps you need to follow in order to fix the problems. It's all a scam, and will lead to you losing money and could lead to identity theft if you give them private financial information. **Utilities cutoff** You get a call from someone who claims that they are from your utility company, and they claim that your utilities will be shut off unless you immediately pay. The scammer will usually ask for payment via gift cards, although they may ask for payment in other ways, such as Western Union or bitcoin. **[Relative in custody](URL Scammer claims to be the police, and they have your son/daughter/nephew/estranged twin in custody. You need to post bail (for some reason in iTunes gift cards or MoneyGram) immediately or the *consequences will never be the same*. **[Mexican family scam](URL This scam comes in many different flavours, but always involves someone in your family and Mexico. Sometimes the scammer will claim that your family member has been detained, sometimes the scammer will claim that your family member has been kidnapped, and sometimes the scammer will claim that your family member is injured and needs help. **General family scams** Scammers will gather a large amount of information about you and target your family members using different stories with the goal of gettimg them to send money. **[One ring scam](URL Scammers will call you from an international number with the goal of getting you to return their call, causing you to incur expensive calling fees. ##**Online shopping scams** **THE GOLDEN RULE OF ONLINE SHOPPING: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.** **Dropshipping** An ad on reddit or social media sites like Facebook and Instagram offers items at huge discounts or even free (sometimes requiring you to reblog or like their page). They just ask you to pay shipping. The scam: The item will turn out to be very low quality and will take weeks or even months to arrive. Sometimes the item never arrives, and the store disappears or stops responding. The seller drop-ships the item from China. The item may only cost a few dollars, and the Chinese government actually pays for the shipping. You end up paying $10-$15 dollars for a $4 item, with the scammer keeping the profit. If you find one of these scams but really have your heart set on the item, you can find it on AliExpress or another Chinese retailer. **[Influencer scams](URL A user will reach out to you on a social media platform, usually Instagram, and offer you the chance to partner with them and receive a free/discounted product, as long as you pay shipping. This is a different version of the dropshipping scam, and is just a marketing technique to get you to buy their products. **[Triangulation fraud](URL Triangulation fraud occurs when you make a purchase on a site like Amazon or eBay for an item at a lower than market price, and receive an item that was clearly purchased new at full price. The scammer uses a stolen credit card to order your item, while the money from the listing is almost all profit for the scammer. **Instagram influencer scams** Someone will message you on Instagram asking you to promote their products, and offering you a discount code. The items are Chinese junk, and the offer is made to many people at a time. **Cheap Items** Many websites pop up and offer expensive products, including electronics, clothes, watches, sunglasses, and shoes at very low prices. The scam: Some sites are selling cheap knock-offs. Some will just take your money and run. What to do if you think you're involved with this scam: Contact your bank or credit card and dispute the charge. How to avoid: The sites often have every brand-name shoe or fashion item (Air Jordan, Yeezy, Gucci, etc) in stock and often at a discounted price. The site will claim to be an outlet for a major brand or even a specific line or item. The site will have images at the bottom claiming to be Secured by Norton or various official payment processors but not actual links. The site will have poor grammar and a mish-mash of categories. Recently, established websites will get hacked or their domain name jacked and turned into scam stores, meaning the domain name of the store will be completely unrelated to the items they're selling. If the deal sounds too good to be true it probably is. Nobody is offering brand new iPhones or Beats or Nintendo Switches for 75% off. **[Cheap Amazon 3rd Party Items](URL You're on Amazon or maybe just Googling for an item and you see it for an unbelievable price from a third-party seller. You know Amazon has your back so you order it. The scam: One of three things usually happen: 1) The seller marks the items as shipped and sends a fake tracking number. Amazon releases the funds to the seller, and the seller disappears. Amazon ultimately refunds your money. 2) The seller immediately cancels the order and instructs you to re-order the item directly from their website, usually with the guarantee that the order is still protected by Amazon. The seller takes your money and runs. Amazon informs you that they do not offer protection on items sold outside of Amazon and cannot help you. 2) The seller immediately cancels the order and instructs you to instead send payment via an unused Amazon gift card by sending the code on the back via email. Once the seller uses the code, the money on the card is gone and cannot be refunded. How to avoid: These scammers can be identified by looking at their Amazon storefronts. They'll be brand new sellers offering a wide range of items at unbelievable prices. Usually their Amazon names will be gibberish, or a variation on FIRSTNAME.LASTNAME. Occasionally however, established storefronts will be hacked. If the deal is too good to be true its most likely a scam. **Scams on eBay** There are scams on eBay targeting both buyers and sellers. As a seller, you should look out for people who privately message you regarding the order, especially if they ask you to ship to a different address or ask to negotiate via text/email/a messaging service. As a buyer you should look out for new accounts selling in-demand items, established accounts selling in-demand items that they have no previous connection to (you can check their feedback history for a general idea of what they bought/sold in the past), and lookout for people who ask you to go off eBay and use another service to complete the transaction. In many cases you will receive a fake tracking number and your money will be help up for up to a month. **Scams on Amazon** There are scams on Amazon targeting both buyers and sellers. As a seller, you should look out for people who message you about a listing. As a buyer you should look out for listings that have an email address for you to contact the person to complete the transaction, and you should look out for cheap listings of in-demand items. **Scams on Reddit** Reddit accounts are frequently purchased and sold by fraudsters who wish to use the high karma count + the age of the account to scam people on buy/sell subreddits. You need to take precautions and be safe whenever you are making a transaction online. **Computer scams** **[Virus scam](URL A popup or other ad will say that you have a virus and you need to follow their advice in order to remove it. They are lying, and either want you to install malware or pay for their software. ##**Assorted scams** **[Chinese Brushing / direct shipping](URL If you have ever received an unsolicited small package from China, your address was used to [brush](URL Vendors place fake orders for their own products and send out the orders so that they can increase their ratings. **[Money flipping](URL Scammer claims to be a banking insider who can double/triple/bazoople any amount of money you send them, with no consequences of any kind. Obviously, the money disappears into their wallet the moment you send it. ##**Door to door scams** **As a general rule, you should not engage with door to door salesmen. If you are interested in the product they are selling, check online first.** **[Selling Magazines](URL Someone or a group will come to your door and offer to sell a magazine subscription. Often the subscriptions are not for the duration or price you were told, and the magazines will often have tough or impossible cancellation policies. **[Energy sales](URL Somebody will come to your door claiming to be from an energy company. They will ask to see your current energy bill so that they can see how much you pay. They will then offer you a discount if you sign up with them, and promise to handle everything with your old provider. Some of these scammers will ""slam"" you, by using your account number that they saw on your bill to switch you to their service without authorization, and some will scam you by charging higher prices than the ones you agreed on. **[Security system scams](URL Scammers will come to your door and ask about your security system, and offer to sell you a new one. These scammers are either selling you overpriced low quality products, or are casing your home for a future burglary. **They ask to enter your home** While trying to sell you whatever, they suddenly need to use your bathroom, or they've been writing against the wall and ask to use your table instead. Or maybe they just moved into the neighborhood and want to see how you decorate for ideas. They're scoping out you and your place. They want to see what valuables you have, how gullible you are, if you have a security system or dogs, etc. ##**Street scams** **[Begging With a Purpose](URL ""I just need a few more dollars for the bus,"" at the bus station, or ""I just need $5 to get some gas,"" at a gas station. There's also a variation where you will be presented with a reward: ""I just need money for a cab to get uptown, but I'll give you sports tickets/money/a date/a priceless vase."" **[Three Card Monte, Also Known As The Shell Game](URL Unbeatable. The people you see winning are in on the scam. **[Drop and Break](URL You bump into someone and they drop their phone/glasses/fancy bottle of wine/priceless vase and demand you pay them back. In reality, it's a $2 pair of reading glasses/bottle of three-buck-chuck/tasteful but affordable vase. **[CD Sales](URL You're handed a free CD so you can check out the artist's music. They then ask for your name and immediately write it on the CD. Once they've signed your name, they ask you for money, saying they can't give it to someone else now. Often they use dry erase markers, or cheap CD sleeves. Never use any type of storage device given to you by a random person, as the device can contain malware. **[White Van Speaker Scam](URL You're approached and offered speakers/leather jackets/other luxury goods at a discount. The scammer will have an excuse as to why the price is so low. After you buy them, you'll discover that they are worthless. **[iPhone Street Sale](URL You're approached and shown an iPhone for sale, coming in the box, but it's open and you can see the phone. If you buy the phone, you'll get an iPhone box with no iPhone, just some stones or cheap metal in it to weigh it down. **[Buddhist Monk Pendant](URL A monk in traditional garb approaches you, hands you a gold trinket, and asks for a donation. He holds either a notebook with names and amounts of donation (usually everyone else has donated $5+), or a leaflet with generic info. This is fairly common in NYC, and these guys get aggressive quickly. **[Friendship Bracelet Scam](URL More common in western Europe, you're approached by someone selling bracelets. They quickly wrap a loop of fabric around your finger and pull it tight, starting to quickly weave a bracelet. The only way to (easily) get it off your hand is to pay. **Leftover sales** This scam involves many different items, but the idea is usually the same: you are approached by someone who claims to have a large amount of excess inventory and offers to sell it to you at a great price. The scammer actually has low quality items and will lie to you about the price/origin of the items. **[Dent repair scams](URL Scammers will approach you in public about a dent in your car and offer to fix it for a low price. Often they will claim that they are mechanics. They will not fix the dent in your car, but they will apply large amounts of wax or other substances to hide the dent while they claim that the substance requires time to harden. **[Gold ring/jewelry/valuable item scam](URL A scammer will ""find"" a gold ring or other valuable item and offers to sell it to you. The item is fake and you will never see the scammer again. **[Distraction theft](URL One person will approach you and distract you, while their accomplice picks your pockets. The distraction can take many forms, but if you are a tourist and are approached in public, watch closely for people getting close to you. ##General resources## Site to report scams in the United Kingdom: URL Site to report scams in the United States: URL Site to report scams in Canada: URL Site to report scams in Europe: URL FTC scam alerts: URL Microsoft's anti-scam guide: URL URL URL URL URL"

Recently I have been building a new PC. I found on Amazon an i7 9700K processor for 300. The seller on Amazon was: URL No mention of aria PC online on the seller page, but today I noticed the order invoice that came with the CPU (noticed today but have had the CPU for 10 days) was from Aria pc and the value noted was Total GBP Excl VAT: 296.15 VAT: 59.23 Total GBP incl. VAT: 355.38 The reason for this background information was because this week I received a letter from ARIA PC stating we write to you regarding your recent order(s) on the Aria PC website.

14,cybercrime,Scams,Australian website scam - Technoforce,1,a3n51m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/a3n51m/australian_website_scam_technoforce/,2018-12-06 22:25:27," I know someone that tried to purchase an iPhone off this website and I've been trying to help them with this. It's 100000% a scam. A very sophisticated scam. They have a long-registered ABN, an ANZ bank account which has been verified, and the guy running the business, ""Courtney Luke"" always answers the phone and emails and seems very professional and friendly. But hes a straight up dog and a shifty criminal and the deeper you look into this URL website, things don't add up. Courtney first claimed that hes in VIC, but then after calling the real estate agent that manages the warehouse they operate from it didn't add up. Doing background IP checks on the website and domain everything leads to the USA. He then later ""admitted"" that hes in Florida in the USA but has a distribution warehouse in VIC. This is why his Australian phone number diverts to the US and its a static connection. When I asked about his funny accent (Asian) he said he was born and raised in Florida...... The way the scam works is you place an order through the website and everything seems legit (secure website, order number, confirmation email). But the next day you get an email from the business saying their payment system is down and they suggest to direct deposit the amount into their bank account to ensure the order isn't delayed. When my friends called the number about the email, Courtney, explains that they're having technical issues with the website. He says if you want to wait for the system to get back online you can use PayPal or credit card later but if you do decide to direct deposit he can process right away. He apparently never pushed for direct deposit too much or came on too strong which is unlike other scams you hear about. But because everything seems right and his customer service seems helpful it gives you false reassurance. Anyway, as you can imagine, if you make that direct deposit payment, its gone. But funnily enough, the outstanding customer service continues. He answers the phone, chases up you order number, answers questions and acts genuinely surprised when you mention scams to him. But the next level effort comes from the tracking number he provides, which is links to a more obvious fake logistics website (URL The company doesn't exist. The tracking number brings up all your info and says the item is shipping for USA but its all fake. We looked up the so-called CEO of this logistics company and the identity of the guy turns up in the obituaries in USA and died years ago. The most priceless part of this investigative journey was when I told Courtney that he is a scam artist and we will report him to the police and he had the balls to call me a criminal and say that I'm trying to scam him! We have told all this to the bank and reported to the cybercrime police but at this stage I don't see any hope of my friend recovering their money. The world can be a cruel place. Technoforce = Bad. I hope other people see this and it can prevent them being scammed by this bastard."

Last night was chatting with a girl on OkCupid. We started texting, and she says she's horny and wants to video chat. Fast forward, I'm naked on webcam beating it. Noticed she's typing with no hands, and I knew I was pwned. The scammer starts threatening to send the vid to my family etc, cause I stupidly give them my facebook account name. So I started shitting my pants, didn't want my poor sister seeing my dick. Also don't want this shit getting to my employer. Decide to meet the demands, ended up wiring 700 in two seperate payments. Well guess what, they kept harassing me. Looked online and the posts with this type of scam said to just ignore/block them, they probably won't post shit. So I blocked them, and I'm feeling better now that they aren't spamming me in broken english. Anyway, I'm going to my local NYC police station later to report this as a cybercrime. They probably won't do shit but it's worth a shot. I do have some basic information on them like the phone # they were texting me from, financial transaction info, and they mentioned they are a Rutgers student. Moral of the story, don't be a fuckhead like me XD"
17,cybercrime,Scams,Just got scammed selling my tablet on Amazon,21,2v9yge,http://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/2v9yge/just_got_scammed_selling_my_tablet_on_amazon/,2015-02-09 17:30:35,"I recently sold my tablet on amazon via Paypal due to me needing to pay my credit card bills and I barely use it anymore. Well, I received a request last week via Amazon from someone who wanted to buy the tablet. I went through with them and sent them an invoice via Paypal to pay the amount of $250 so I can ship them the tablet. I began receiving emails from Paypal saying I had to give them the tracking number first so that no one would be scammed throughout the transaction. I was given the address and everything via the Paypal email. I ended up shipping it to Malaysia on Friday and paid $80 to ship it which was included in the payment. Afterwards, I reply to the Paypal email with the tracking number and it confirms that I shipped so it said that it's processing the funds into my account. I also talked to the buyer and she claimed that she received a notification about it but I never gave her the tracking number. Then today, I receive another email from Paypal saying that it already ended up in Malaysia and claims that it was stopped at customs. Then, it said I had to go buy a $200 moneypak card to get it out of customs. Then and there, I knew I was being scammed. I called Paypal only to be told they cannot do anything about it because the payment actually never went through and the transaction ID was fake. They referred me to contact the cybercrime government agency to file a complaint. Which I did. I just contacted amazon and the post office about trying to get it back before it leaves the US. I sold the tablet for $250 and paid $70 shipping out of my own pocket so I am now pretty much broke after this weekend. I hope this gets settled somehow, this is not how I wanted to start my week. TLDR; Don't respond to Paypal E-Mails ever. Use the Paypal site. "
