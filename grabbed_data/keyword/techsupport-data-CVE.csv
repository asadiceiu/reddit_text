I've been having this problem and it's been stumping me. A few weeks ago these BSODs started happening for no reason. &amp;#x200B; I wish I had any kind of dump file on hand, but everytime a BSOD happens it just crashes in the middle of the BSOD. My laptop either shuts down during the BSOD or it just gets stuck at 0% Complete. &amp;#x200B; I've done everything I could think of to try and fix this issue and nothing seems to be pointing me in the right direction. I've tried: 1) Stress testing my SSD for one and a half hours to try and check for errors via HPs recovery utility. No errors found. 2) chkdsk. No errors found 3) sfc /scannow. No errors found 4) Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth. No errors found. 5) Full hardware test from a HPs recovery utility. No errors found. 6) Full virus scan. No viruses found. &amp;#x200B; I've had 4 BSODs so far. 1-3 happened about a week apart from each other. Here's what happened during these BSODs: 1) I sent a message on Discord, then immediately the screen started flickering. Programs started closing by themselves. The screen went black, followed by a BSOD. This was a ""CRITICAL""..? I couldn't read the rest of it because my laptop shut down in the middle of the BSOD. I can only assume it was ""CRITICAL\_PROCESS\_DIED"". My laptop restarted and I was greeted with a message saying the computer couldn't find my boot drive. I restarted my laptop and everything works perfectly. &amp;#x200B; 2) Tried to launch Eclipse, sudden BSOD. I couldn't read the error for this one because it shut down right as the "":("" displayed. I turned off automatic restart on BSODs after this happened. &amp;#x200B; 3) Mouse started lagging like crazy, and everything froze. The screen went black for 30 seconds followed by the BSOD. This was a ""CRITICAL\_PROCESS\_DIED"", and it was stuck at ""0% Completed"" for half an hour before I just decided to turn the laptop off. &amp;#x200B; 4) I was using Google Chrome, it suddenly went black. I was able to bring up other programs I had open like Discord, but not for long. It suddenly froze and an ""UNEXPECTED\_STORE\_EXCEPTION"" error happened. This one was stuck at ""0% Completed"" as well. &amp;#x200B; Temps were perfectly fine throughout all of these events. I wasn't running anything intensive (Discord, Google Chrome, Google Docs). My BIOS and drivers are updated to the latest version. I've had this laptop for less than a year so I would be surprised if it decided to kick the bucket this early. It's a HP Spectre x360 2018 Vega. &amp;#x200B; I've also tried poking around in Event Viewer to try and find any problems, but nothing obvious sticks out. I've noticed this log has appeared twice right before a BSOD occured: ""The hypervisor did not enable mitigations for CVE-2018-3646 for virtual machines because HyperThreading is enabled and the hypervisor core scheduler is not enabled. To enable mitigations for CVE-2018-3646 for virtual machines, enable the core scheduler by running ""bcdedit /set hypervisorschedulertype core"" from an elevated command prompt and reboot."" Though I'm not sure if this means anything in this situation. &amp;#x200B; If anyone has any kind of advice that would help me narrow down the problem, it would be greatly appreciated. I'm just stumped."

7,CVE,techsupport,A way to be sure I've been spoofed???,1,a46075,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/a46075/a_way_to_be_sure_ive_been_spoofed/,2018-12-08 11:43:37," Today I was unassumingly checking my school Outlook e-mail and was taken aback by the following, ""Hello, I am a spyware software developer. Your account has been hacked by me in the summer of 2018. I understand that it is hard to believe, but here is my evidence (I sent you this email from your account). The hacking was carried out using a hardware vulnerability through which you went online (Cisco router, vulnerability CVE-2018-0296). I went around the security system in the router, installed an exploit there. When you went online, my exploit downloaded my malicious code (rootkit) to your device. This is driver software, I constantly updated it, so your antivirus is silent all time. Since then I have been following you (I can connect to your device via the VNC protocol). That is, I can see absolutely everything that you do, view and download your files and any data to yourself. I also have access to the camera on your device, and I periodically take photos and videos with you. At the moment, I have harvested a solid dirt... on you... I saved all your email and chats from your messangers. I also saved the entire history of the sites you visit. I note that it is useless to change the passwords. My malware update passwords from your accounts every times. I know what you like hard funs (adult sites). Oh, yes .. I'm know your secret life, which you are hiding from everyone. Oh my God, what are your like... I saw THIS ... Oh, you dirty naughty person ... :) I took photos and videos of your most passionate funs with adult content, and synchronized them in real time with the image of your camera. Believe it turned out very high quality! So, to the business! I'm sure you don't want to show these files and visiting history to all your contacts. Transfer $971 to my Bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet: 1Q35Tr3ccKWVJjt3yXDuFFD7FRnqCx2UxU Just copy and paste the wallet number when transferring. If you do not know how to do this - ask Google. My system automatically recognizes the translation. As soon as the specified amount is received, all your data will be destroyed from my server, and the rootkit will be automatically removed from your system. Do not worry, I really will delete everything, since I am 'working' with many people who have fallen into your position. You will only have to inform your provider about the vulnerabilities in the router so that other hackers will not use it. Since opening this letter you have 48 hours. If funds not will be received, after the specified time has elapsed, the disk of your device will be formatted, and from my server will automatically send email and sms to all your contacts with compromising material. I advise you to remain prudent and not engage in nonsense (all files on my server). Good luck!"" Some other info: as you may ascertain from the subject, the sending address was to my own. Whenever I check my sent box, nothing shows up. No only that, but my school requires MFA with every login, and I haven't got any texts or anything that hint at someone trying to log on to my account. I'm not terribly worried about the ""hard funs,"" or whatever that is. In fact, if I'm worried about any surveillance being distributed, I find the prospect of people seeing me stuff my face with Cheetos while crying to Netflix's holiday rom-com attempt (God, it's terrible) far more concerning. My general grossness being exposed is also more disturbing than whatever this e-mail is referring to. But since this portion seems to be a scam, and I'm super broke, I'm not cracking open the ol' piggy bank. However, what of the ""hacked"" e-mail? Is there anything in the message details that would reveal this to be spoof? I noticed this ""Authentication-Results: spf=softfail (sender IP is 35.174.145.124) smtp.mailfrom=yahoo.jp;"" and this ""Received-SPF: SoftFail (protection.outlook.com: domain of transitioning yahoo.jp discourages use of 35.174.145.124 as permitted sender)"" Does this mean anything? Is there really no way to detect a rootkit or RAT such as this? I have ran the standard MalwareBytes and their anti-rootkit beta. Nothing was found. Oh, and finally, what the heck is with this cisco router thing? My home router is netgear. But I may have used a cisco on campus or somewhere else. Should I be concerned?"

Usually to bypass this problem I would've turned off power supply and after running it back again I would spam F12 to get the boot menu and manually select my SSD , but now if that doesnt work and I can't get the menu at all so my desktop stuck at a boot loop , I tried cleaning CMOS again and removing all the usb devices except keyboard but nothing seems to work . I sent a support ticket to gigabyte 4 days ago but from what I've read they tend to ignore tickets with this problem , heres the ticket I sent ""I purchased my machine late 2014 , everything worked great until the beginning of 2016 when this problem occurred (like shown in the video) URL I tried many things including : 1.

15,CVE,techsupport,Was that ASUS Router AiCloud vulnerability ever patched?,1,4rqhai,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/4rqhai/was_that_asus_router_aicloud_vulnerability_ever/,2016-07-08 05:38:00,"So I've been messing with my ASUS Routers cloud functionality. And while trying to find a way to make multiple accounts so I don't have to give my family the Admin Account and Password. I noticed people talking about a gaping hole in how AiCloud handles security. I have a RT-N66R (its basically a RT-N66U), I'm using the latest firmware 3.0.0.4.380_3264 at least according to the update settings. I don't use the default login and password. I don't even as so much let the account be Admin. CVE only list vulnerabilities for lower version of the firmware. But I can't find any info as to if the vulnerability was patched or not or if I'm safe using non default login info. Thanks in advanced. And if I am safe does any one know if the latest version of the firmware supports 4TB externals using ext3 or ext4, the compatibility list only shows 3TB using ext3."

Family member's computer. I'm using it temporarily. CPU was running really high (70+%) without any applications open. Checked and it was SVChost/System hogging up resources. After backing up data manually, I tried to run Updates but that failed for a reason I have yet to figure out. It ran updates, failed at the end. OS didn't boot when I turned machine back on, went to rotating colors. Powered down and it went through the Update Failed, Reverting Windows. I then ran MSE and it discovered the following: -Exploit:Java/CVE-2010-0840 -Exploit:Java/Midesq.A -TrojanDownloader:Java/OpenConnections.OS -TrojanDownloader:Java/OpenConnections.OU I removed the items with MSE, then ran Malwarebytes and no threat was detected. CPU is back down to normal levels, which is great but still obviously worrisome that it was so high in the first place while an infection was active. This is where I'm at now, any advice on how to proceed from here would be greatly welcomed and appreciated. EDIT: Just checked and computer is running Java vs SIX. Updated it. "
20,CVE,techsupport,Strange Wi-Fi problems - Disconnects and Slowdowns,8,3l7nxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/3l7nxu/strange_wifi_problems_disconnects_and_slowdowns/,2015-09-17 05:58:41,"Hello /r/techsupport, I'm about to become desperate. Our home WiFi has several problems and I can't even tell if they are related. We have a 50mbps Internet connection with a Hitron CVE-30360 and every device is connected via WiFi. At prime time there are up to 8 devices (max) connected per WiFi (3Laptops, 2PCs, 3 Smart-phones mostly with 2,4ghz receivers). Wired connections are sadly no option. When using 802.11 b/g/n the WiFi is quite unstable but fast. (~1 Disconnect every 1-2 hours but still up to 45-50mbps) When only using 802.11 b/g the WiFi is really stable but slow. (no Disconnects but only up to ~10-15mbps) (Speed was tested when only 1 PC was connected to the network) (A disconnection here stops the Internet connection but the connection to the router stays active) I know that the max transfer rate of b is about 11mbps but we should normally be fine with g which transfers up to 54mbps. But I can't tell why n results in an unstable Internet connection. Our WiFi channel is automatically set by our router. I ran some tests and the channels it took were fine and not to much overcrowded. One PC in our network showed from time to times notifications about IP-conflictions. Our router is set to automatically assign IPs, so we tried to solve the problem by using static IPs on our main machines, didn't really solve the speed or stability problems. Another problem occurs when connecting my laptop to the Network. When I connect it via WiFi it slows the speed of every machine in the network. While testing it a few minutes ago it slowed the network speed of my PC from 14mbps to 0,1-1mbps, while the laptop itself only got 0,1-1mbps as well. (shown in Windows taskmanager while starting random YouTube videos and downloads at both machines) Connecting the Laptop via cable to the network does not result in a slowdown of the network. Using a WiFi stick instead of the onboard WiFi card didn't change much. I'm really frustrated by now and I really hope you can help me here. Thanks in advance for your efforts! (Disclaimer: I'm not a native speaker and therefore apologize for every wrong used idiom or similar. Suggestions for improvements are welcome.) EDIT: I maybe should add that the the slowdowns caused by my laptop occurred on Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 (witch I upgraded to with the option to wipe everything)"

This server has access to the Internet. I don't know if it is coincidence or a potential attacker but the very next afternoon (9/23), I found an event in the application event log for Symantec logged at 11:20am saying ""OS Attack: GNU Bash CVE-2014-6271 attack blocked. Traffic has been blocked for this application: SYSTEM"". Nervous, I stopped the RAS service and confirmed I could no longer VPN I to the network. This afternoon (9/24) I checked the event log again and the same event occurred at 11:01am today. What could this be? It worries me as it only started after setting up VPN, I saw no other instances in my event log prior to these or prior to setting up VPN. It seems to be happening around 11am, I did not see any system scheduled jobs at that time except for Google update which kicked off only at 11:07am. What remediation steps should I take? Should I be really concerned? Also, how can I make it so that VPN connection requires a client certificate in addition to a network username/password. Does Windows server have this capability? Thank you all in advance. "
