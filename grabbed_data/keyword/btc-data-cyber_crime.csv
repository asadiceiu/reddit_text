The Treasury Department has expressed very serious concerns that Libra could be misused by money launderers and terrorist financiers. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have been exploited to support billions of dollars of illicit activity like cyber crime, tax evasion, extortion, ransomware, illicit drugs, human trafficking... **This is indeed a national security issue**. &gt; &gt; The United States has been at the forefront of regulating entities that provide cryptocurrency. We will not allow digital asset service providers to operate in the shadows, and will not tolerate the use of the cryptocurrencies in support of illicit activities. Treasury has been very clear to Facebook, bitcoin users, and other providers of digital financial services, that *they must implement the same anti-money laundering and countering financing of terrorism (known as AML/CFT) safeguards* as traditional financial institutions. **Money transmitters** of cryptocurrency must comply with the relevant bank secrecy act obligations (known as BSA), and register with the financial crimes enforcement network, known as FINCEN. &gt; &gt; **Many people are not familiar with FINCEN.** It is a bureau of the US Department of Treasury. *FINCEN's mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit use, combat money laundering, and promote national security through the dissemination of financial intelligence.* Last year alone it collected over 20 million BSA reports, and has collected over 300 million in the last 11 years. FINCEN implements the bank secrecy act's regulation and has **federal regulatory, supervisory, and enforcement authority** over money service businesses and banks. &gt; &gt; The rules governing money service providers apply to physical and electronic transactions alike. As money service businesses, *cryptocurrency money transmitters* are subject to compliance examinations just like every other US bank. To be clear, FINCEN will hold any **entity** that transacts in bitcoin, Libra, or any other cryptocurrency, to its highest standards. &gt; &gt; I also recently established the Financial Stability Oversight Council's Working Group on Digital Assets. This FSOC group enables US financial regulators, such as FINCEN, the Fed, OCC, CFTSC, CFPB, SEC, and other key stakeholders to work together to combat risks posed by cryptocurrencies. &gt; &gt; As the president has said, bitcoin is highly volatile and based on thin air. We are concerned about the speculative nature of bitcoin and will make sure that the US financial system is protected from fraud. Given the international nature of cryptocurrencies we are also going to great lengths to ensure that effective regulation does not stop here at the US border. &gt; &gt; Last month, led by the United States, the Financial Actions Task Force, known as FATF, the global standards-setter for AML/CFT, adopted comprehensive measures on how countries must regulate and supervise activities and providers in this space. This was a major step toward harmonizing international regulations concerning cryptocurrencies. We have also had extensive work at the G20, and I will be addressing this again this week at the G7 finance ministers in France. &gt; &gt; To be clear, the US welcomes responsible innovation, including new technologies that may improve the efficiency of the financial system and expand access to financial services. That being said, with respect to Facebook's Libra, and other developments in cryptocurrencies, *our overriding goal is to maintain the integrity of our financial system* and protect it from abuse. &gt; &gt; **Treasury takes very seriously the role of the US dollar as the world's reserve currency, and will continue our efforts to protect our country and secure the US and global financial systems.** &gt;"

Since then, I have not seen my money. Several emails to them just gave me canned responses (""we are busy, we will get to you in time""). I posted on r/cexio and got some bs reply from their rep (u/cex_io), that ""we are busy, other exchanges are busy too (whataboutism)"". According to their [post](URL the company is not facing liquidity problems. However, in the eyes of the law, this is a moot point. CEX.IO Ltd is a private limited company incorporated in the UK. Pursuant to [section 123(1)(a)](URL of the Insolvency Act 1986, a company is deemed insolvent as long as they *for 3 weeks thereafter neglected to pay the sum or to secure or compound for it to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor*. You make your own judgement. Details of the company - URL A look at their latest financial report (found in the link above) shows that their fixed assets are currently located in a warzone. it also shows that the company has been making a loss. Frankly, I don't even wish to make this post, if cex.io could just tell me where my money is and when I can expect to get it back, it would have been fine. But the stonewall is concerning and I had to resort to such measures. u/cex_io, please give me a reply, my ticket is #543006. I will be more than happy to edit/take down my post if i receive a satisfactory reply.

4,cyber crime,btc,Editorial on Peter Todd and the BU Client Vulnerability,5,5zfz18,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5zfz18/editorial_on_peter_todd_and_the_bu_client/,2017-03-15 11:01:02,"_Preface_ I am tired of the debate between Core and other clients. I, personally feel that the disclosure of the bug from someone like Peter Todd is more likely to be a political act over disclosing a bug. If it was at least reported through proper channels, I'd rather have seen a Github issue created with Peter Todd linking to it. _Returning to my editorial_ Peter Todd, a contributor to Bitcoin Core has recklessly disclosed a bug that knocked 75% of Bitcoin Unlimited nodes. Bitcoin Core has a very apparent way to disclose a critical bug like this, as shown below, however Peter Todd used this finding for political motivation. Now, I understand that Bitcoin Unlimited doesn't have a webpage with key developers and PGP keys, however if the tables were turned and a Bitcoin Unlimited developer released a bug for Bitcoin Core taking down 75% of the nodes, there would be chaos in the Bitcoin community, likely with [involvement with cyber-crime agencies](URL around the world. But since this was a client that ""violates consensus rules"", all is fine. To sum it up, a Bitcoin contributor and a fairly large name in the Bitcoin community has, in my mind, irresponsibly released a [bug on Twitter](URL all for political gain. I believe that a responsible developer, regardless of political alignment or beliefs, should responsibly report _critical_ bugs like this one through the proper channels. Now I don't care if you support Core or Unlimited, but please, responsibly disclose bugs like this through private channels. I guarantee taking five minutes out of your day and tracking down a dev on IRC is worth it, we all believe in Bitcoin, so why don't we act like it? _Post Rant Addendum_ Also, I do notice [this comment](URL so there was the chance that this was the bug simply to catch media attention. I don't know what to believe, as I am neither a developer for Core nor Unlimited. Maybe we need more people to scour the code of all clients and ensure they are safe on the network. [Link to BitcoinCore Bug Reports](URL &gt;Responsible disclosure &gt; &gt;bitcoin-security@lists.sourceforge.net &gt; &gt;If you find a vulnerability related to Bitcoin, non-critical vulnerabilities can be emailed in English to any of the core developers or sent to the private bitcoin-security mailing list listed above. An example of a non-critical vulnerability would be an expensive-to-carry-out denial of service attack. Critical vulnerabilities that are too sensitive for unencrypted email should be sent to one or more of the core developers, encrypted with their PGP key(s).

5,cyber crime,btc,Is this article correct about the BitGo XL Insurance Policy?,3,4w234r,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4w234r/is_this_article_correct_about_the_bitgo_xl/,2016-08-04 11:31:50,"A user called Venomspike posted this on Steem: What sets apart the policy that BitGo secured is the broad coverage. The following describes the coverage secured under XL Group: ""The customized insurance product, exclusive to BitGo, was structured in collaboration with XL Group and Innovation Insurance Group, LLC. It is a robust cyber and professional liability policy that goes well beyond narrow crime policies previously adopted by some bitcoin vault providers. BitGo customers who opt-in to the program are protected from acts, errors, or omissions of BitGo technology, processes, and employees, including external hacking incidents and employee theft. Both hot wallets and cold storage are eligible for coverage in the policy. In the event of a covered loss, the policy would reimburse BitGos customer, as a direct loss payee, for the value of the lost or stolen bitcoins, subject to the terms and conditions of the insurance policy with XL Group. "" Keyword here is ""external hacking incidents and employee theft"". Based on the language here it would appear that the policy should cover the theft of funds, even if it was due to negligence on behalf of a BitFinex employee. The full announcement can be found here: URL Some customers on BitFinex were large players and had funds in excess of $1m. This was evident during market events where large bid walls or sells walls in excess of 1000 btc were placed. These larger customers will not be reimbursed their full amount based on the $250k coverage limit. We can assume that at minimum $20m of the hacked funds is ineligible for coverage, meaning an estimated claim of $50m would need to be paid. Lastly, can the insurer bear the burden of such a large claim? XL Group is a publicly traded company with a market cap in excess of $9b. They have roughly $8b net of premiums and can sustain a claim of $50m. URL "
6,cyber crime,btc,The truth about Igot.com and Rick Day,9,3z472b,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3z472b/the_truth_about_igotcom_and_rick_day/,2016-01-02 18:18:39,"I have opened an account with Igot.com more than one year ago in the UAE after hearing about them in the national (local paper) through Vignesh Raja who was managing their PR in the UAE. They claimed to be locally based in the UAE and had a local bank account. I deposited smaller amounts first until depositing a total of 16k USD within the same month. I kept trading for a whole year -or perhaps so I thought- and had circa 10 USD remaining which I opted to withdraw on October 26th 2015. Since I sent my request I have discovered the following: A. Communication: The only way to reach Igot is through a support ticket after logging into your account or through emailing Igot or 'rick day', and they usually redirect you back to the support ticket. The only catch here is that their response to either tickets or emails is sporadic and basically just promises which are unfulfilled. B. Legal info regarding Igot and their affiliation with Australia: while Igot claims to operate in many countries including UAE, and also claim to be Australian , they used to have an entity in Australia which was affiliated with Igot brand historically back in March 2015, but no longer is, more info on that can be found here: URL , furthermore, their India affiliate which has Anshuman Dayma -AKA 'Ansh' as referred to on the Igot.com website- as one of the directors is called Igot Tech Solutions, more info on them can be found here: URL In their terms and conditions they refer to Beaumont Ventures who is based in Hong Kong, and has the following bank account Bank in HK: Bank Name Hang Seng Bank Account Name Beaumont Ventures Limited Account Number 288-570856-883 Branch Hong Kong City Hong Kong Swift code HASEHKHH Beneficiary Address Suite 1101, 11/F, Supreme House 2A, Hart Avenue, TST, Kowloon, HongKong Bank Email hello@igot.com Bank Phone 0420392214 More details on their legal structure and to know more you can follow this link: URL C. Igot Team: One year ago the Igot team had several other people, including 'Dan' who was in charge of their social media communication. now it's only ""Rick Day"" and ""Ansh"". Both are brothers and their real names are ""Raghav Dayma"" and ""Anshuman Dayma"". D. Igot has informed me that they have closed their UAE bank account and do not seem very bothered that I'm upset that my withdrawal has exceeded 2 months, or that I am raising this matter to the authorities. E. So what can you do when Igot does not honor your withdrawal requst? Here are a few ideas: 1. Social Media: Twitter, Reddit, Facebook and make sure you tell all the people Igot are following on twitter about your experience, a lot of them are possibly potential investors who will be more than interested to know about how 'Rick' is not honoring his agreements 2. Your local newspapers and media, in the case of the UAE, I did a search over all the media channels they used for advertisement and told them about my story, usually they would like to know if they were unknowingly advertising for a potentially questionable business. It's also important to note all the spokes people they used be it direct employees or PR because when you raise a case later, if you do need to, they will be accomplices in advertising false information, regardless of the terms mentioned on Igot's website. 3. Talk to your local authorities, this includes financial regulators, licensing authorities, consumer protection and central banks. Once you're done with that you can move on to the other countries where Igot is operating and share your experience. 4. Talk to the Australian authorities including ACORN who are in charge of monitoring Cyber Fraud, here are a few links: URL (Make sure you mention Rick Day, and his real name, as well as Ansh and his real name in your report, you can always refer to their Australian entity. URL Make sure you mention Igot technologies and you can get all needed info from the link above URL Complain to the central bank in Kenya who is currently investigating the legitimacy of bitcoin companies such as Tagpesa who was recently acquired by Igot URL Monetary authority in Singapore, their entity there is : igot Singapore 51 Goldhill Plaza Singapore 308900 Singapore As for the location where Rick Day is currently based, you can report him to the following authorities: URL FBI Internet crime investigation F. After demanding from 'Rick' to return my money, I was blocked from their twitter account. I will post other ways to report Igot soon. I already informed Igot that I will be taking action against them, because I really worked hard for my money and will not sit around with my fingers crossed hoping they have a change of heart. "
7,cyber crime,btc,DDOS and Occam's Razor,3,415bi8,https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/415bi8/ddos_and_occams_razor/,2016-01-16 08:54:24,"I have spent the last few years in read-only mode on all things BTC on Reddit, mostly through the ZeroBlock app. First time poster. I was aware of some DDOS activity on XT nodes, but was not fully educated on the matter until the Hearn departure with mic drop. From the New York Times article: *""The hacker responsible for the attack, who appeared to be based in Russia, told Mr. Hearn in an online exchange that someone payed me for killing XT  though he declined to say who was responsible.""* It is obvious that the DDOS attacker had no interest in Bitcoin at all. He has a skill that he is selling on the Dark Markets and anonymous parties pay him with BTC for targeted attacks. The r/bitcoin censorship only slightly irritated most of us casual observers, but DDOSing XT nodes and bringing down ISP's and data centers is a whole new level of censorship. Who is truly responsible for these attacks? When there are competing explanations, the simpler one is usually correct (Occam's Razor). Questions you have to ask yourself: Who had the financial means to pull this off? Who had the technical expertise to know this would work? Who had the motive? Who dropped out of the heated discussion? People were calling for Peter Todd's head over his $10 example. Where is the outrage over the international cyber crime of DDOSing US based nodes? Gregory Maxwell should get a knock on the door by the FBI. His Blockstream and r/bitcoin buddies will pull the same tactics on Bitcoin Classic or any other implementation that takes power away from his Core power trip. When Maxwell is viewed as the criminal he is, the rest of his buddies will turn their back on him and Bitcoin improvements have a chance. As an aside, I entered a support ticket to ZeroBlock with the suggestion of changing their Reddit pointer to r/btc. If you guys know of any other apps that default to r/bitcoin discussion, help join the good fight by requesting a pointer change away from the evil censorship team."
