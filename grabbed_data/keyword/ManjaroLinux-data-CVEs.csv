Maybe if I get lucky this system will continue to run for quite a while without breaking down? :) I'd been running Ubuntu since 6.06. Unfortunately Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS (as of HWE Kernel 5.4) still had random lockups for Ryzen 3000 CPU. To my surprise Manjaro just worked out of the box! Overall I get far fewer issues with Manjaro than with Ubuntu. Two years ago I ran the architect installer in virtual machine for a minimal installation of Manjaro Gnome. It was a tracked experiment to see how frequently Manjaro breaks, so that I can decide if I can use it for production. To my surprise, it had issues only if I tried to update a one-year-old system. Even those 3-months-old systems just updated fine. I've also noticed that when Arch update requires manual intervention, Manjaro usually takes care of it without manual intervention. This is a huge bonus for those who don't have much time to follow Arch news like onlookers of scary Windows 10 updates for non-LTSC versions. (Arch users feel free to downvote. I do respect those investing efforts into maintaining vanilla Arch; but for some people, time is a luxury to have, due to commitments in life.) I like the idea that Manjaro pushes updates about 3 days after Chromium releases updates for CVEs. This is quite a good balance between security and stability. After all, attack surface is still mostly about the web browser. I appreciate dev's efforts on fast-tracking of security updates. While Manjaro is still not the best perceived, I do hope this distro will thrive. Take Ubuntu as an example: a good leader specialised in business looks like a good start :D URL"

I want to keep all the other packages on the stable branch, I don't want pacman to complain about the packages being ahead of the repos, and I want the packages to keep inline with the latest updates (like the version in the main Arch repos). What are my options here?"
