0,cyber crime,NoStupidQuestions,"Is it wrong for me to support Non-Offense Pedophiles as they need help, as well as constantly stopping people from misusing between the Term Pedophile and Child Molestor?",1,i9295n,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/i9295n/is_it_wrong_for_me_to_support_nonoffense/,2020-08-14 01:44:50,"Prior to this, I've always wondered why the term Pedophile is so misused, just incase if there's people doesn't know the actual definition, I'm posting it here Souce: URL URL Pedophile : A person that's having a sexual attraction to children Child Molestor: An act child abuse in which an adult or older adolescent uses a child for sexual stimulation. I would like to also state the fact I FULLY SUPPORT NON-OFFENDING PEDOPHILES, but I'm COMPLETELY AGAINST the act CHILD MOLESTING. The number one difference between both of them being Pedophile is a desire, thoughts. While Child Molesting is an action. Being attracted to children, is not wrong. Its just how you think. Instead, what you do with those thoughts is what matters. Many believe the false stereotype that all pedophiles are intent on molesting children, which is nowhere near true and People who stigmatize them would realize that we're not all bad if they had a look at the reserved and malice-free attitude of non-offending pedophiles, Who intend no harm to children and would only ever pursue romantic ideals with them, that means inappropriate touching and sexual compliments would be out of the question. Its not illegal to be attracted to someone, have a desire for anything. Even laws that made it illegal to be gay didnt try to figure out who was secretly having an attraction to the same sex. Actions are illegal; not desires. Sexual abuse of children is illegal; pedophilia is not. At the same time, PEDOPHILLIA isn't a choice a person can made, it's likely to be born with it. Which is why I support Non-offending Pedophiles, they had to control their impulses for the whole life. The pedophile is not automatically going to sexually abuse a child, just as a gun is not automatically going to shoot and kill a human. If desire's a crime, lust's would be a crime too. As I've stated above, people nowadays always believed that Pedophile = Child Molesting I sympathize with Pedophiles because they had to control their impulses for their whole life. Which is why from my perspective, having people stop misusing the term would give non-offending Pedophiles a better place. Not all pedophiles are child molesters and not all child molesters are pedophiles, in fact, most child molestors are Situational Offenders I honestly don't know if I'm being too nerdy for this, since the internet had always misused the internet slang. Sure, as long as it doesn't harm any groups. But in this case, Non-Offending Pedophiles are getting their reputation ruined worldwide just because majority missued the term, causing them to hesitant to get help. I thought what I've been doing is going to clear the misunderstanding, as well as an act for non-offending Pedophiles restoring their reputation. At least that's what I thought perviously. Yesterday, in a certain community, an infamous figure that's related to our community has came back. He's done Cyber Child Molesting before, which is why majority resented his return. I'm personally neutral to the case, but I've used the opportunity to stop people from misuing, as well as voiced my statement that I fully support non-offense pedophile but against child molestor thingy. Which leads me to being called out, that leads to tons of harassment, to the point if majority calling me a Pedophile, and later, presumed permanently muted me from the server. I did sent proofs of my statement, yet still all ended in vain, harassment to this very day. Since then, I found out that majority of the user that corrected other users for misusing the term Pedophile or similar words faced the same harassment as I am. Mostly along the lines of stating the user is a Pedophile. Then I've realized, is it because that I am thinking too much to the point of I'm being seen as an pedophile aplogist to everyone? Is it because of the coincidence that the infamous figure has came back? or should I really just follow the internet slang? All of this are my point of view, I'm honestly don't know what should I do at this point, and I need your guys help to answer my question."
1,cyber crime,NoStupidQuestions,Wasnt sure where else to post this. Trumps 100 day plan from 4 years ago. How did he do?,1,ii0t6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/ii0t6a/wasnt_sure_where_else_to_post_this_trumps_100_day/,2020-08-28 14:47:55,"Below is the 100-day plan Trump's campaign released in October, called ""Donald Trump's Contract With The American Voter."" What follows is my 100-day action plan to Make America Great Again. It is a contract between myself and the American voter  and begins with restoring honesty, accountability and change to Washington Therefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC: * FIRST, propose a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress; * SECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health); * THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated; * FOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service; * FIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government; * SIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. On the same day, I will begin taking the following 7 actions to protect American workers: * FIRST, I will announce my intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205 * SECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership * THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator * FOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately * FIFTH, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars' worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. * SIXTH, lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward * SEVENTH, cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix America's water and environmental infrastructure Additionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law: * FIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama * SECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States * THIRD, cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities * FOURTH, begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that won't take them back * FIFTH, suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting. Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration: Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate. End The Offshoring Act. Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free. American Energy &amp; Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to give parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-side childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families. End Illegal Immigration Act Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars. Restoring National Security Act. Rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester and expanding military investment; provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice; protects our vital infrastructure from cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values Clean up Corruption in Washington Act. Enacts new ethics reforms to Drain the Swamp and reduce the corrupting influence of special interests on our politics. On November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government. This is my pledge to you. And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people."

I know that shady people use VPNs to commit crimes and to attempt to circumvent detection, but this whole practice of claiming ""no logs"" then leaking logs to the government is crazy. On one hand, advertising a ""no logs"" policy but not abiding by it is false advertising. On the other hand, developing a service that can easily be used to facilitate cyber-crime can either lead to VPN provider having to keep logs ""in the down-low"" or to be outright banned in some countries.

The presenters or even just people in the audience have this snarky demeanor about them and would rather point the finger at the victim instead of the people who actually committed the crime."
7,cyber crime,NoStupidQuestions,IS this a known scam? My wife's credit card was used to buy something - but they sent it to us. (self x-post from r/personalfinance),3,be8qj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/be8qj0/is_this_a_known_scam_my_wifes_credit_card_was/,2019-04-18 00:54:13," I'm having trouble wrapping my head around why this happened. It's clear someone got a hold of my wife's personal information. We've talked to Amazon and the credit card issuer and now know these things happened: * Using my wife's first and last name, they created a new email account. * They then used that email address to create a new Amazon account. * They used my wife's credit card information to purchase a \~$100 item. * However, they selected the ""Make this a Gift"" option so there would be a gift receipt (no note was included), and had it sent to *our address.* Obviously, we've contacted the credit card issuer to close that account and receive a new account number. We've also contacted the authorities to report the cyber crime / possible identity theft. What we can't understand is why the thieves only made one purchase, and sent it to *us.* Obviously, as soon as we received something we didn't order, we looked into it, and had the credit card and Amazon accounts closed down. So the thieves were only able to purchase one thing with the card, but now we own the item, not them. What happened here? Is this ""Part One"" of a longer scam? Wouldn't credit card thieves typically try to make a big purchase, or a series of hard-to-detect smaller purchases, and keep the stuff? It crossed our minds that it may have been someone local who wanted it delivered to our address so that they could pick it off of our porch, and wouldn't have to use their own address, but the package sat on our porch for an entire day without being disturbed. Also - why use the Gift Option, then?"

Im sure none of that existed in the 1800s. So what happened when the first person committed cyber crime and there was no law against it? Were they just able to walk away with it?

(Doxing, online threats, hijacking other people's accounts, etc) What's the appropriate course of action a parent should take in this situation? I don't know about ""appropriate"" but the course of action I was thinking of was to take a laptop elsewhere, use a VPN and create a few anonymous accounts and bait my kid/local kids into threatening me, where I would then proceed to wreak havok on my childs various gaming accounts and social media (with info/passwords that I as a parent would and SHOULD have this whole time) along with a few anonymous threats of my own, and sending physical mail to my kid and local friends of my kid who are involved with a simple message that says something like ""I know where you live. -AliasUserName"" My main question, is do you think in Canada anything I listed above would/could be considered illegal? Would it be violating any laws if it were done in other countries? I know we have pretty sketchy laws when it comes to cyber crime here in Canada so I don't think I'd be doing anything illegal by just trying to put a bit of fear into my hypothetical kids that I don't have. (not that I'd ever expect anyone to connect any threats I made back to me anyways) Anyway, this is the kind of random stuff I daydream about. It just sucks when you hit a technical snag in the middle of a daydream and have no idea how something would legally play out. Then you imagine a bunch of scenarios and then something you made up pisses you off and you're in a really bad mood for the rest of the day."
