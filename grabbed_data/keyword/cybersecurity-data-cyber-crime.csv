0,cyber-crime,cybersecurity,Cert question for guy in forensics with offer for training funding by employer.,1,i9t391,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/i9t391/cert_question_for_guy_in_forensics_with_offer_for/,2020-08-15 05:59:33,"I'm currently a forensic science instructor (think evidence and law enforcement, not cyber) learning linux and building cybersecurity knowledge with udemy. Certification should have strong application to forensics in electronic media. I'm aware of and interested in compTIA security+, but have an opportunity for significant funding for professional development through work that would provide incentive going a bit deeper (into pockets and knowledge). Basically, I've looked GIAC offerings, CCE, and various other certs catering to digital forensics. GIAC?- definitely in budget with work/study which I am told I am highly eligible. Seems legit, but overpriced and highly marketed. CCE?- seems dated and has an odd sketchy link (on a cybersecurity organization website?; insurance-tek). Directly related to my current professional content. Expensive. What else is there? Is a GIAC worth it if paid for by employer? Is GIAC too specific for an entry level guy, there are several certs that cater to my current field and I cannot get funding for mutliple? Any advice appreciated, looking for ways to enrich my skills at current job and likely poise for a move that takes me out of my current role to something more directly applied. Employer really enjoyed hearing that I thought our content was behind and we need to offer better instruction for electronic crime/evidence, to be up to date. I want a training that is mostly worth it's value and carries some professional weight and credibility."

Comparing scenarios of the probable eliminates the need for scare tactics and enables well-informed decisions: the true drivers of effective risk management. But are we covering all of the major information risks? *Digital ad fraud may be one major information risk not being analyzed.* **Marketing Spends As Many Dollars On Digital As IT** Background: you may remember from several years ago, [talk that the CMO would exceed the CIO in terms of budget control](URL The actual situation isnt clear because worldwide IT spending is $3.7 trillion while worldwide advertising spending is only $560 billion. However, surveys show [IT spending ranges from 1.2% to 11.2% of revenue](URL vs. a [Gartner 2018 CMO survey](URL which says that the marketing spend averages 11.2% of revenue. Within the marketing budget: the estimated global spend on digital advertising  the target of digital ad fraud  is $330 billion per year. CMOs in the US, for example, spent $197 billion on advertising in 2018. Lets put this $197 billion in context: the FBI estimates cyber crime losses in 2019 were $3.5 billion in the US based on data from their Internet Crime Complaint Center ([URL If digital ad fraud is 1.8% of US advertising/marketing spend, these losses would be greater than all of the FBIs IC3 cyber crime losses. Whether it is cloud, servers, or ads  dollars spent on Digital Tech all have associated cyber risk. **There Is Likely A Lot of Digital Ad Fraud** But how much digital ad fraud is there? Dr. Augustine Fou is a Gerson-Lehrman Expert Witness in Digital Marketing and an Anti-Ad fraud consultant with Marketing Science Consulting Group. In a recent article titled [Is Ad Fraud 9% or 90%](URL he described the known and unknowns of digital ad fraud: &amp;#x200B; * The total cost of ad fraud is debated: TrafficGuard/Juniper set it at **$34 billion**, predicting it will increase to **$87 billion** by 2022; most of this will be lost in the APAC region \[Asia Pacific\], with the current $19 billion set to rise to $56 billion * The WFA predict ad fraud will become the biggest market for organised crime by 2025, worth **$50 billion** * On the other hand, White Ops Inc. And the Association of National Advertisers state that only **$6.5 billion** was lost to ad fraud in 2017, down from $7.2 billion in 2016 * **21.3% of iOS** app and **26.9% of Android** app installs are fraudulent, according to Interceptd * **28% of web traffic** comes from non-human actors, says Adobe (thus setting the overall cost of ad fraud at **$66 billion** according to one commentator) * Interceptd stats show that in Q4 2018, device farms accounted for 25% of ad fraud, incent abuse for 20%, bots/emulators for 18%, SDK spoofing for 13%, click spamming for 9%, click injection for 8%, and other sources for 7%; * [MarTech Advisor](URL peg levels for the same quarter at 57% click injection, 24% click spam, 11% SDK spoofing, and 8% fake users/bots; levels vary across the year in both estimations * TrafficGuard/Juniper stats show that of **$25.8 billion** lost to the three most-prevalent forms of ad frauds, app install farms/SDK spoofing account for 42%, click injection for 30%, and click spam for 27% * SDK spoofing can **siphon off 80% of ad budgets**, warns MarTech advisors Michael Paxman * In response to the rising cost of ad fraud, in January 2018, Procter &amp; Gamble announced it was planning to **save $750 million** by cutting its ad budget, and halving the number of agencies (from 2,500 to 1,250); this was to be followed by a **further $400 million** cut * In 2017, JPMorgan Chase reduced the number of sites it advertised on **from 400,000 to 10,000** (and saw no change in business outcomes) Dr. Fou then examines data points specific to digital ad fraud, including: &amp;#x200B; * **In 2017**, Judy malware, and Fireball malware was discovered using humans' devices and fake devices to generate **billions of fake ad impressions per minute**; Hyphbot was also disclosed, another botnet targeting highly lucrative video ad inventory. * **In 2016**, Whiteops unmasks Methbot, a botnet that targeted high-CPM video ad inventory and disguised itself by using residential IP addresses, remaining hidden for years, stealing $2 billion (annualized) * **In 2014**, ""Kraft Says It Rejects Up to \_\_**85%**\_\_ of Ad Impressi"" [URL * **In 2013,** [URL and we already had stats that show that about two-thirds of the traffic on the internet is not human. It's not necessarily fraud, but there are both good bots (e.g. search engine crawlers) and malicious bots that do a ton of stuff online and cause a ton of the traffic on the internet. A last data point: a graph from Dr. Fou showing the internet activity vs. digital advertising, also including mobile activity. Note the divergence that starts around 2012: URL This isnt necessarily a smoking gun, but it certainly is worth thinking about: If this graph is accurate, ad spend has outpaced human internet activity by a factor of 4! Or in other words, there needs to be 400% more ads and/or more expensive ads per unit of human activity to account for this divergence. Particularly given the spread of ad blockers, this seems suspicious... **If half of the divergence between ad spend vs. human activity is fraud, ad fraud would be 30% of all digital advertising spending!** In any case, Dr. Fou argues that we dont have enough data to quantify the total digital ad fraud loss, but it certainly seems probable that the amount of ad fraud is at least 15%. At 15% fraud, the global losses would be $50 billion a year - 14 times more than the sum of all FBI/IC3 reported cyber criminal proceeds in the US. It isnt as much compared to the $1.5 trillion overall cyber criminal economy as [reported by Dr. Michael McGuire](URL but is far more than ransomware, BEC, identity theft and all other consumer level crimes, combined. **Why Could There Be So Much Digital Ad Fraud? Its The System** Systemic reasons have enabled ad frauds omission from information risk focus, despite the large numbers in question. Marketing spend is typically the CMOs domain and thus apart from information security. Structurally, the digital ad platform owners  principally Google and Facebook  directly benefit from this ad fraud. This is not to say they aid or abet it  Im fairly sure they dont  but 50% of every dollar spent on an ad platform goes to the platform owner. If digital ad fraud is 15%, then removing it would cause 7.5% of revenue loss, platformwide. The platform owners are not the only conflicted parties. Agencies and marketing departments are often use it or lose it: budget not deployed this year is likely to become budget not allocated the next. And then there are the affiliate marketers  which Ive personally seen could be directly participating in it. From my own experience, I have worked on cases where there was clear digital ad fraud occurring. One case involved an engineer at the customer org working on a new analytics capability for their web site. He was monitoring the analytics algo performance by sending queries from his own computer and reviewing the incoming traffic on the web site; he noticed that his own queries were coming back marked as 3rd party referred. URL This is interesting because 3rd party referred is normally due to affiliate marketing efforts redirecting in traffic from 3rd party sites  but is clearly inappropriate here since the traffic originated from the same domain as the web site. Due to a complete lack of logging at multiple levels  the customers web site as well as the commercial ecommerce hosting platform  it was not possible to definitively determine how this fraudulent labeling occurred. The most probable method was through a javascript injection  potentially via the orgs external marketing companys analytics tie-in to the web site in question. And yes, there was a financial relationship between the partner marketing firm and the 3rd party affiliate marketer  not unusual but also a motive, means and opportunity intersection. It seems clear that digital ad fraud committed upon an organizations marketing budget could be a very significant problem  if so, this raises many questions: **You Need To Address Digital Ad Fraud In Cyber Risk Analysis** Are digital ad fraud scenarios being taken into account as information risks at all, much less a major information risk? Is any part of the present information risk organization responsible for digital ad fraud? Should these loss scenarios be addressed by marketing? The infosec organization? Some other group like the risk committee? How should digital ad fraud be treated in FAIR? While the asset is clear in this case  the digital ad budget  it seems that the body of work done on the threat events, threat community and susceptibility is potentially far less well understood. More importantly  while FAIR is a tool to direct data gathering and to inform security and information risk controls, how should data gathering be accomplished to address digital ad fraud risk?"

Read on to see how this ties up to the topic of Cybersecurity :) When I was a little kid everything was perfect... for me at least. My parents eventually separated when I was 8 years old and from there everything became a living nightmare. My mom had to pick up two jobs to get us by. There were 4 little shits she had to take care of and considering she is nothing close to educated, she mainly worked long hours for shitty pay at warehouses and manufacturing plants of some sort. Me and my brothers spent A LOT of time alone without a sign of proper parenting around. I am the oldest and therefore the one to take not only blame for the things that I did wrong like breaking a table or somehow breaking something else, but I also took a whooping for whatever my brothers broke too. It was a shitty accountability problem I never signed up for. My mom did the best she could along the way. She made a lot of mistakes. She chose the wrong guys. I remember the time I spent locked in my room, against my will of course, for a total of two years, only allowed to go to school and back when I was maybe 11 or 12 years old by her abusive partner at the time. Let me add that my ""room"" was empty, and only contained pictures I drew and hung up on the wall on college ruled paper, a blanket, and one of those stereos from the early 90s where they integrated a record player and a tape player. I only had one tape. It was Eminem's ""Marshall Matthers LP"". Man I loved that tape and still listen to it once in a while today. I made a lot of mistakes myself. Nothing crazy. I never believed in hurting people, mostly myself. Until one day I got a bright idea. I wanted a dog. We moved around a lot from ghetto to ghetto but I was rasied mostly in Los Angeles in a crazy city named Pomona. So it made sense that I did not only want a dog, I wanted a big scary-looking Rotty or a huge, brawn-muscular standing Pit Bull. I wanted to walk around my ""hood"" with my big ass dog showing everybody I was tough and shouldn't be fucked with... at least I thought I did. So I think you'll understand my dissapointment when my brother beats me to it and walks into the apartment one day with the smallest fucken Yorkie I had ever seen. I mean as far as dogs go, I was hoping to get about 100x more dog than what my brother brought home that day. ""What the fuck is that!?"" I asked, ""It's a puppy!"" my dumbass brother replied. ""I know it's a puppy. I wanted an actual dog where's the rest of it!?"" He seemed confused. Typical, he was the dullest we had available in a row of brothers. The little shit stayed cause he couldn't take him back where he got it from. I vowed to not take care of it! It wasn't my dog! I said I wanted a big tough dog not a snack for it. The little dude walked by me once in a while throughout the day. I looked down at him. H elooked up at me with the same ""fuck you too"" face I had on myself. I didn't bother him. He didn't bother me. Things remained balance that way. I started to notice my brother wasn't feeding him though. His bowl was empty a lot and his water bowl was dirty. I guess I could lend the little shit a hand this one time, JUST THIS ONE TIME! He wouldn't eat it in front of me cause fuck me I guess. He had spunk man I givem that. Hungry as shit but proud lol. He became my dog. I fucken fell in love with him. All of my pain and all of my anger and all of the dissapointment that had riddle my little ignorant head was finally asleep and all I could see was this little, 1 pounder running around. Man, as far as being understood goes, the little guy did a better job than anybody else ever did. And then I lost him. He got sick and it was my fault. I let him out and he got sick. And I gave the vet all of my money wich was $500 dollars and he gave me vitamins and sent me home knwoing there was nothing that was going to save him. I was heartbroken. For a short moment I had everything that I ever needed and I wasn't deserving of it. I destroyed it. I had never felt that type of pain before. And I had never felt it since. I wasa piece of shit no more. I wanted to know everything about the veterinary field that I could. I was hurt, pissed, and ready to wreak havoc upon the field to find my peace. I spent hours learning. I went to protests against whaling, animal abuse, circuses. I signed petitions. I wanted to become a veterinary technician. And I did. It's what I do now at an animal emergency and neurology hospital. I did everything that I could to get here. I came into the field pissed off. I cam in and absorbed it all. I became really fucken good at it. Its been almost 10 years. I've done a lot of good. I've saved a lot of pets. I've contributed to the field and I have remained by my core beliefs even when the bigger fish dissagreed with me. My fight has concluded. Little dude. I will always remember you. Because of you I stopped fighting myself and fought for you instead. I have always been alone in this. Since before you, and after you. Everything that I have ever needed has been lost in my dark and twisted childhood forever, or it exists here in the world of cyberspace. Which leads me to why I'm here in this subreddit in the first place. My purpose has always been to be a positive force in the universe. I have always, even in my lonely world, cared for other people. And because of that I want to pick a new fight where what I do helps those who can't help themselves. I want my work to matter. I am looking for meaning. A new fight I can fight alongside others. A place where I can help push against those who steal, destroy, and corrupt. I think Cybersecurity is a place like that. I love the way this community feels about the field. I like that it takes hard work, it takes actual passion, and it leads to good things. I like that there is a fight to be fought. That's where I belong. In a fight. Which leads me to the conclusion of all of this. I am here beginning a new venture. Picking up what I can online with courses and articles and Youtube videos. But I feel I am missing inspiration and that's okay I just need to dig deeper. Inspiration comes in all sorts of channels. I ask that you tell me your story below. Tell me why you're fighting here. Tell me why you bother to get up in the morning to do this job. Tell me why it is important you show up. Tell me who the fuck are we fighting? Why are they doing what they're doing and why does that matter to you? Who is affected by cyber crime? I'm looking for inspiration. I'm looking for meaning. thank you!"

If there are any keywords that you don't know, just **Google** the keywords: ""Define virtual private network"" **Who are cybercriminals?** There are international crime syndicates operating in Every Country from Every Ethnicity from Every Gender from Every Age Group from Every Occupation. We cant read human thoughts. People turn into crime for economic survival. **Reasons why cybercriminals do what they do?** 1. Disrupt work systems to reduce their own work or destroy their promotion competitors. 2. Seek vengeance for not receiving financial rewards by business for their hard work. 3. Plan on leaving so they want to steal data that will be valuable in their next job. **Human\_Errors - What are the examples of human errors that reduce cybersecurity effectiveness?** You accidentally delete info, accidentally mis-configuration of your computer systems thus disabling security technologies, &amp; accidentally, infect a computer with viruses. **Sources of Viruses &amp; Malware:** Malware is a term for any malicious software that can be installed on your computer or other devices including viruses, spyware, ransomware, trojan horses and keystroke loggers. Malware is commonly delivered by email and can appear to be from legitimate sources, such as your utility provider, a government agency or even the police purporting to issue a ne. Dont click on the link or open any attachments that you arent absolutely sure about. You may be downloading malicious software instead. These scams target both individuals and businesses. Keystroke loggers and spyware allow scammers to record exactly what you type on your keyboard to nd out passwords and bank details or access personal information and send this anywhere they want. Once installed, scammers can control your email and social media accounts and grab whatever information is on your device, including passwords. They can also use your accounts to send more scams to your friends and family. Ransomware is another type of malware that encrypts or locks your device to prevent you from using it until a payment is made to unlock it. Paying up doesnt guarantee it will be unlocked or be free from hidden viruses, which can also spread and infect other computers or devices on your network. **The Internet** The majority of malware is spread over the Internet. Malicious applications can end up on your computer: * By visiting a website that contains malicious code. For example, you could fall victim to a drive-by attack. * By downloading malicious applications that are disguised as ordinary applications. * By downloading files via peer-to-peer networks (for example, torrents). **Email** Malware can be found in the body of an email or in the attachments. When opening such emails or saving the attachments, you can infect your computer. You can also receive phishing and spam messages in your email inbox. **Software vulnerabilities** Software vulnerabilities allow hackers to remotely access data on your computer, as well as network resources and sources of confidential information. **External storage drives** Malware can be stored on external drives and in network folders. If you run a malicious application on an external drive, it could spread a virus to all the disks of your computer and wipe your data. **Other users** Another person using your computer may cause it to become infected without realizing it.

Having gained their target's trust, they then request sensitive information or items which allow them access to their target's bank accounts - things your bank would never request themselves, such as: * Your 4-digit PIN * Credit or debit cards, chequebooks or cash * Online banking codes or passwords * Transfer of funds to a different account for ""safekeeping"" **Vishing** Fraudsters call out of the blue claiming that a fraud has already happened, or may be imminent. They may already have some information about you, and may pose as bank staff, the police and other officials or companies in a position of trust. The fraudster will then try to persuade you to: Transfer money to another account for ""safekeeping"" or ""holding"" Withdraw cash and hand it over ""for investigation"" Divulge private information, which can then be used to gain access to your finances In many cases, these cold callers will suggest you hang up the phone and call them back on another number. However, it is easy for them to keep the connection open and intercept the call, so all the information you think you're giving to your bank is actually going to them. It's important to remember: Be wary of unsolicited approaches by phone, especially if you are asked to provide any personal information. If you are suspicious or feel vulnerable, don't be afraid to end the call and refuse requests for information Fraudsters can use ""call spoofing"" to deliberately falsify the telephone number relayed on your caller ID to show as a genuine bank number The bank will never call you to ask you to generate a Secure Key code or ask for your PIN number Never share your security details with anyone else Criminals may already have some basic information about you (name, address, account details); don't assume a caller is genuine because they have these details or because they claim to represent a legitimate organisation. **Smishing (SMS Phishing)** Be wary of suspicious text messages sent by fraudsters that look like they have come from your bank to trick you into giving over your personal and financial information (by calling a number or clicking a link). It's important to remember: Bank will never ask you for your full PIN or password Bank will never text you a link that takes you directly to our login page Fraudsters can use ""text spoofing"" to deliberately falsify the telephone number to appear as ""XYZ Bank"" to seem like a genuine bank text Never share your security details with anyone else If you have suspicions regarding a text message from Bank, call the Bank on a known number (e.g. number on the back of your card) to check before acting on it If you suspect a text is Smishing, please call the Bank Genuine emails from banks and other financial organisations will address you by name. Some scammers send out emails in bulk, addressing them only with Dear customer or Hi. Rather than containing a link to log-in your account, the company gives you the steps to log in. There is a phone number listed in the email. You can cross-reference this against the banks real phone number by searching for the company's website and checking the number listed there. Alternatively, you can also check the phone number listed on the back of your ATM or credit card. **Phishing** Be wary of unsolicited emails that appear to be from your bank and contain links to websites urging you to provide confidential, personal or financial information. The emails may appear to come from a legitimate site and often warn that your account may be shut down unless you take some action. These emails are designed to steal your personal information and use it to access your accounts.Do not reply to or, click on a link from any email that you are not sure is genuine. Instead contact the company, using an authenticated telephone number. A scammer contacts you out of the blue via email, phone, Facebook or text message pretending to be from a legitimate business such as a bank, phone or internet service provider. They direct you to a fake version of the businesss website asking for your personal details to verify customer records due to a technical error. They may call imitating a luxury goods retailer claiming that someone is trying use your credit card.They advise you to contact your bank but they dont hang up from their end and keep the line open. When you try to call the bank, you are still talking to the scammers who simulate a real call, imitate bank staff and ask for your account and security details. In either case, the scammer captures whatever information you give them and then uses it to access your accounts. Phishing emails typically: Warn you of some sudden change in an account which requires you to verify that you still use the service Use poor spelling and grammar Request confidential or security information such as your internet banking details, passwords, account numbers or PINs Include instructions to reply, complete a form or document attached to the email or click through to a website in order to verify your account. Don't open attachments or click on links if you suspect they may not be genuine.If you receive a suspicious-looking email purporting to be from the bank - call the bank. Delete the email and empty your deleted items. **Survey** 1. Scammy Survey sites sell you other services and products and take your financial information so you pay to get surveys. 2. Where do scammers hack to get your personal and bank details &gt;&gt; They hack hospitals, businesses, banks, your home, everywhere. 3. Never pay to join survey sites. Never give your real personal details, home address and financial information. Look for a privacy policy. Dodgy sites email you from Gmail, Yahoo or other free email accounts. Never be a mule and take a big payment of any kind where you have to pay some of it back. If it sounds too good to be true, its too good to be true. Set up a ""survey only"" email address. Check the company Australia Business Number via Google ""ABN look up"" 4. Don't do surveys. Fake surveysScammers offer prizes or rewards such as gift cards to well-known retailers in return for completing an online survey. **Taking online quizzes scam** Those online quizzes and Facebook questions that claim they can tell you your favorite breakfast food based on your mother's maiden name, or that ask you who your favorite teacher was in high school aren't quite as innocuous they seem. Rather, scammers ""use this data to hack your accounts or open lines of credit in your name,"" the Sutton Police Department said on Facebook. The survey requires you to answer a range of questions including disclosure of important identication or banking details. PART 1"

19,cyber-crime,cybersecurity,Is a password manager (like LastPass) more secure/convenient than Chrome Password Manager?,1,dw1yyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/dw1yyi/is_a_password_manager_like_lastpass_more/,2019-11-14 12:23:45,"I am a hardcore Google fan. I use a Pixel and Google Chrome. I use strong, unique passwords (random alphanumeric/special character strings of 16+ characters) for all of my accounts. I also turn on 2FA wherever possible. I sign onto chrome on my phone, laptop, and desktop and sync passwords between all of these devices using Chrome Password Manager. Very rarely, I will sign onto Chrome on a public computer, but I am always very careful to log-out and remove all of Chrome's data (history, passwords, etc.) when I am done. Is something like Lastpass more secure than what I am already doing? The biggest security flaw of what I am currently doing (that my research suggests) is OS access on one of my trusted devices. If someone can log into my phone, desktop, or laptop, they can view all of my passwords. To counteract this, I have a password on all of my devices and restrict physical access to them. This [blogpost](URL from Lastpass suggests the following major advantages of a stand-alone password manager. ### Anytime, Anywhere Access With LastPass, your data is not stored in a single ecosystem (such as your browser). Rather, LastPass syncs all of your data across every browser and device on which youre accessing LastPass. When you use a browser to store your passwords, you can only access the data on that browser. What about when you need that password on your phone or tablet? Youre out of luck. And should your computer crash or your smartphone go for a swim, everything youve stored in LastPass is securely backed up. You can even log in to your account when you dont have Internet access. Youre never without the information you need. **But Google syncs and backs everything up for me already.** ### Security Model Your LastPass account is protected by a master password that only you have. The master password is never sent to our servers and can only be retrieved by you. LastPass requires you to log in to your account before gaining access to the passwords and data stored in the vault. Some browsers require a log in, but not always, and not by default. Weve built LastPass with AES 256-bit encryption, widely recognized as one of the strongest encryption standards available. Encryption and decryption happens locally on your device. Our zero-knowledge architecture ensures that we never have the master password, and therefore never have the key to your data. We strengthen the master password and encryption key against large-scale, brute-force attacks by slowing down guesses with salted hashing and PBKDF2 implemented with SHA-256. Browsers also encrypt their passwords (though the Opera browser [suffered an attack](URL in mid-2016) but details beyond that are hard to find. LastPass and other password managers make their security model readily known for users. **My Google password is a master password. Lastpass has also been prone to attacks.** ### Whats the Password Again? How many times per week are you asked whats the password for by your spouse, kids, or even friends? Probably more than you like to admit! With your browser, you do not have a way to share those passwords at all. Password managers like LastPass allow you to share not just passwords (think household bills and streaming media), but also important information like medical IDs, your AAA number, and passport numbers. Not only is it simple to share these in LastPass, but also safe because all data is encrypted and decrypted locally. **I can just orally tell my trusted friends/family my passwords. This is definitely less convenient, but it is hard to justify spending money for/switching to another service just for this convenience.** ### More than Just Passwords The term password manager is a little misleading at this point because most tools do much more than manage your passwords. They also autofill those passwords for you, as many browsers do as well, but they do SO much more. * **Password generator**: LastPass allows you to generate strong, unique passwords right from the new password field or your browser extension, whichever is easier. * **Payment cards &amp; addresses:** Especially during a busy shopping season, its a hassle to enter your credit card and shipping address over and over again. With LastPass, securely store those in your vault and you can fill them in a few clicks when you need them. * **Two-factor authentication**: With Google Chrome, you can add [2FA](URL to your Google account, but we know [most people dont](URL do that. Make sure you take this extra step when youre using a password manager! * **Security Challenge**: Put your passwords to the test with the Security Challenge and find any weak, duplicate, and potentially-insecure passwords. **Google has a built-in password generator and can store payment and address information. Google also scans leaked passwords and has 2FA.** Sure, letting your browser save your passwords is easy. We get it. But so is using a password manager! With LastPass, just [download the extension](URL for your browser of choice and youll be able to take advantage of LastPass asking you to save passwords  just like Chrome or Firefox  but without the security shortcuts. Password managers are just as easy to use and they offer even more features to protect your digital life  all without comprising your security. &amp;#x200B; **Is there something I'm missing?**"

23,cyber-crime,cybersecurity,Healthcare Cybersecurity: The Solution is Security &amp; Operations Center (SOC),0,dfuhq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/dfuhq2/healthcare_cybersecurity_the_solution_is_security/,2019-10-10 18:27:05," In recent years, many cyberattackers targeted the healthcare industry. It exposes the tens of millions of customers data including identities. Due to this it possess a loss of more than $1 billion USD. So the security of data becomes one of the most serious issues. Cyberattacks in healthcare field causes the exposure of personal information, vital personal medical information and also a persons identification information. Sometimes customer using the same email id as that of his working email id. Cyberattacks causes the information leakage of working station. Also the identification details got stolen due to which cyber crime increases. Cyberattack causes the alteration of personal medical information. And hence, the medical treatment goes wrong way resulting in the loss of human life and sometimes dead. Therefore Healthcare Cybersecurity is important. The solution to these problems is Security and operations center(SOC). Let us see what is SOC? ### What is Security &amp; Operations center(SOC)? Healthcare cybersecurity has a solution to eliminate the chances of cyberattacks. And the solution is SOC. SOC is not a new concept. It has been a part of a nations military and national security departments from many years. A security operations center is a team of experts and cybersecurity analyst and also trained engineers. It detects, prevents, investigates, responds to and analyses cyber threats. SOC team is dedicated to high- quality IT security operations. SOC uses both the latest technologies and best practices with procedures to keep organizations cybersecurity up to date. It has the ability to monitor all systems continuously without hesitation of shift work of employees. It continuously monitor the logging activity. Team uses a multiple computer programs and specialized security processes that analyzes the weak point of companys virtual infrastructure and protect the company from occurring an intrusion or theft. ### Importance of Security &amp; Operations center(SOC)- SOC offers a complete data security to the organizations data. With the help of SOC, an organization can go to the deep of network to discover the weaknesses and build an active detection system. SOC allows security functions to work more broadly and faster. SOC is able to detect when something wrong activity occurs with the network and handle that situation appropriately according to the security concern. ### How Security &amp; Operations center(SOC) works? The initial phase in setting up an associations SOC is to plainly characterize a procedure that consolidates business- explicit objectives from different offices just as information and backing from administrators. As strategy has been developed, the infrastructure required to support that strategy must be implemented. The exemplary SOC infrastructure has firewalls, IPS/IDS, break detection solutions, probes and security data and also event management system. Technology collects data via data flows, packet capture, telemetry, syslog and other methods so that data activities can interact and analyzed by SOC team. The SOC monitors networks and activities to protect important and sensitive data. ### How to build SOC? 1. Develop a strategy to build SOC. It includes identifying your key business objectives and real time capabilities. 2. Start SOC with the core functions. These include monitoring, detection, response and recovery. Delay the non- core functions until your core functions are mature. 3. Keep SOC design firm to the foundation. Start with some critical use cases and design the initial solution for those use cases. 4. Define your functional requirements based on your business objectives. Then choose a SOC model based on these technical requirements. Design the technical architecture for your SOC. This would include defining workflows, figuring out the areas for automation and also identifying the business and information systems to be integrated. 5. Ensure that the SOC staff devices are completely protected and require verification. Also, make sure that remote access mechanisms are in place for both SOC staff and outsourced staff, if any. 6. Verify log management infrastructure, onboard a minimum collection of data- critical resources and onboard your security analytics and automation capabilities. At last, start deploying end-to-end use cases from threat detection to response and recovery. Interoperability of the system is critical. 7. Consolidate threat intelligence feeds and automated inputs from different sources. This will help to improve your SOC detection capabilities. As a result, this directly improves the performance. 8. You can start with the implementation as you set up your technology and deployed the capabilities. Test all use cases comprehensively, especially to some shifts and in between changes. Try to make the reliability and security of the solution as possible. 9. Finally, check that you dont leave the SOC on autopilot once it is operational. It requires continuous fine- tuning and maintenance to keep it running. This also includes tuning to improve detection capabilities, integrating other systems as inputs or outputs, and periodically reviewing the SOC staff, model and requirements. ### Benefits of having SOC- Actions performed by SOC has significant effect on business outcomes. Cybersecurity is increasingly crucial, brands that embrace more protective measures and keep them ahead. SOCs can give positive results due to focus and expertise. Some benefits are as follows. #### Centralizing the display of assets- Real time use of software and processes helps organizations to ease the problem detection as they occur sooner. Centralized and continuous visualization SOC monitoring is more advantageous in maintaining the smooth operations. #### Increase the employee and clients trust- Clients and employees want their information to be safe because it was given to the company. Applying security procedures prevents data loss and so is the best way to improve brand integrity. #### Collaborating across departments and functions- SOC are a team having highly trained engineers which offers security to the organizations. As they work with cybersecurity incidents, so require other departments to work parallely to solve a problem with efficiency. It requires to coordinate and communicate with organizations. #### Increasing the awareness, Decreasing the cost- Most important advantage of SOC is, it increases the ability to control all systems and reduce the loss of data and prevents the financial loss. SOC helps to maintain the secrecy of sensitive information and saves money due to avoiding cyber-attacks."
24,cyber-crime,cybersecurity,Why isn't EthicalHacking/Cybersecurity as popular in mainstream schooling?,39,dp26df,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/dp26df/why_isnt_ethicalhackingcybersecurity_as_popular/,2019-10-30 15:58:11," I've wondered this for a while now, because from the way I see it, with the rise of our dependence on technology, and the rise of cyber crime in recent years, shouldn't the cyber security industry be a super hot market to be in right now? And if so, why isn't this trickling into our mainstream schooling system. I went to a decently well known university in canada and out of all my years there, not once have I heard of anyone wanting to get into cybersecurity or hacking. The only time I hear about it is through the internet. Am I missing something here. Is there not as much money in the industry in comparison to some of the other tech jobs out there? I ask this because I've always been intrigued and have considered diving into this industry multiple times now. I am naturally curious and love problem solving. I'm considering diving head first into this world but only if it is worth it in the end. It is something I could be passionate about, but at the same time I want to make sure it can earn me a decent living. To me it seems like a very lucrative opportunity for intellectuals, but it just bugs me that it hasn't become mainstream and whether or not there's a reason why that is."
25,cyber-crime,cybersecurity,Just started going to my local community college for cyber security. Are there any good books relating to the subject?,4,cqq5kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/cqq5kj/just_started_going_to_my_local_community_college/,2019-08-15 23:55:38,I just got an audible account since I basically have my headphones on 10 hours a day at my current warehouse job. Im on the prowl for new books and I was thinking I should find a good book relating to the subject of cyber security that might familiarize me with some vocabulary Im going to be running into in my near future. Obviously nothing written for engineers but if theres a true crime book dealing with aspects of cyber security I think that would hold my attention and help me learn some of the basics of the field. Thanks everyone
26,cyber-crime,cybersecurity,Local PD's role in Cyber Crime,10,cv7pn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/cv7pn6/local_pds_role_in_cyber_crime/,2019-08-25 22:08:11,"Hey all, I started thinking about to what degree my local PD will deal with cybercrime before kicking it up to the feds. I looked around online for some info, a particular line to report cybercrime locally, an office, pretty much anything but didn't see much. I stumbled upon a document from a national police assocation about how they need to improve their knowledge and ability to handle these things on a local level. Things like using private companies, recruiting from local colleges, etc. I decided to swing by the headquarters rather than call to see if I can get some answers. The initial answer I received from a gentlemen at the front desk was ""I've been here 2 years and never heard one mention of cybercrime unfortunately"", the other dude thought I was trying to report a crime and when he realized I wasn't he didn't have much to add. After them trying to figure it out for a few mins a voice form the back yells out that they sometimes will have cybercrime detectives in the building. This gentlemen had a little more knowledge but not much and just knew they existed and dealt with mostly revenge porn, stalking and financial crimes like CC fraud etc. None of them could find a contact for one of these detectives or knew when they might be there. It was Saturday so I didn't expect anyone there that day, thought I could maybe pull a direct phone number from them. Basically it ended with them asking me to come back Monday when more people were available. They never asked my name or for me to identify myself in anyway, gave up a lot of unnecessary information and are clearly not trained in any meaningful way on social engineering etc. I am going to go back tomorrow and see what else I can find out, maybe talk to one of these detectives. I don't know if anyone else is interested in this but I found it pretty revealing and concerning at the same time. My intention is to find out how they contract out work to private companies and what kind of services they look for. If there is any interest I'll post an update. Has anyone else looked into this locally or have more info about it? Thanks."
27,cyber-crime,cybersecurity,What if our government(s) provided third-party verification?,3,cdlxsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/cdlxsg/what_if_our_governments_provided_thirdparty/,2019-07-16 05:11:47,"We keep hearing about election interference, fake news and accounts trying to game the system. Facebook alone has something like 30,000 people trying to keep fake accounts etc. in check but it's a losing battle because with every new security measure, bad eggs eventually find a way around it; it's a never-ending battle that's never going to be won. This is just Facebook, we also have all kinds of scams (i.e. email scams etc.). The internet is only going to play an increasingly large role in our lives going forward and hence become an increasingly large security risk. As nations evolve their ""cyber warfare"" this is only going to be compounded. Currently, police forces already seem very powerless to combat these issues. It should really be the government's responsibility to keep people safe/enforce the rule of law AND make sure our elections etc. are not vulnerable to foreign influence. It seems highly irresponsible to look to individual companies to make sure these problems don't exist. I'm wondering if it would be feasible for government to set up a third party verification system and what the benefits and drawbacks would be? Let's presume you were given a number similar to a social security number/social insurance number (let's call it an internet security number ISN for now). Then, if you wanted to sign up for a Facebook, Twitter, email account or steam, these services could include a bit of code where you enter your ISN and it would take you to a secure government site where you could verify your identity. Government wouldn't have access to any of the data associated with the account(s), the only real information they would gain is knowing which apps/services citizens use, which might actually be useful in ensuring their online safety. The internet as a whole would essentially remain unchanged; i.e. if desired, you could remain anonymous unless you commit a crime. If nations collaborated on this (think NATO first), any accounts not verified would be prevented from posting/go into spam OR be identified as unverified. If someone does commit a crime (i.e. scam) the person against whom the crime was committed can report the offending account and provide any evidence at which point police could look into the matter and charge the appropriate party if necessary. It would also make it far easier for entities such as Youtube or Facebook to deal with fake news/accounts etc. Once an individual has been sufficiently been identified as a perpetrator of such offences, they could be banned from the platform and, most importantly, prevented from making new accounts etc. I guess since this doesn't exist, is it a bad idea and if so, why? What are the drawbacks I'm overlooking?"

Why? Fraudsters are becoming more sophisticated at identifying targets and crafting messages that evade traditional secure email gateways. And humans, despite an avalanche of warnings and millions spent on security awareness training, continue to make flawed decisions about what is trustworthy and what simply is not. ## Zero Trust Does Not Work Zero Trustthe security principle that everything inside and outside a network needs to be validated before gaining accesscan harden systems against external and internal attacks that lead to data breaches, embezzlement, fraud, and other malicious activities. In terms of machine interaction, its effective. But add people to a system and things change. Criminals know that people are the weakest point in most systems, so they go after them. Last year, there were more than [22 phishing attacks sent every minute ](URL every day. These organized fraudsters also know that security is always evolving, so they continuously adjust their techniques to avoid detection by SEGs and appear more convincing to their targets. So in a world full of headlines about scams and cons, why are people so trusting? Stanford business professor Roderick M. Kramer wrote in the Harvard Business Review that not only do we come into the world hardwired to trust the people around us, but most of us go on to [treat trust as a one-time decision](URL which we dont revisit when we get new information. If weve decided to trust emails from the CFO, we keep on trusting them, even when an urgent request to make a secret wire transfer seems a little off. Once weve decided to trust the emails sent from our Director of Human Resources, it takes something big to make us change our mind. The same can be true of third-parties youve worked with in the past and big-name brands you know and love. This drive to trust can, and often does, override anti-phishing training, which is why [30% of trained recipients will still open a malicious email](URL Not only do many people fall for phishing even after training, but they also mistake a lot of legitimate messages for fraud. Our [own survey](URL recently found that worldwide, over half of phishing reports sent by employees to SOCs are false positives. Triaging each false positive report eats up nearly six hours of SOC analyst time. Cybercriminals are taking advantage. Millennialsnow the largest generation of workers and consumershave the most confidence that they can spot phishing attempts. Unfortunately, theyre also [more than twice as likely as older adults to get phished](URL So long as deceptive messages make it into inboxes, phishing attacks will succeed, and SOC teams will spend hours triaging both legitimate and false alarms. Clearly, the traditional approach is not working. ## Phishing Fallout Beyond Direct Losses The [average loss per successful BEC attack](URL is $1.3 million. And because 96% of data breaches now start with a malicious email according to the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report, there is also the potential for higher breach-related losses stemming from phishing. Lets not forget the potential loss of employment for executives deemed responsible, loss of shareholder value, and loss of money by consumer victims of brand-impersonation attacks. When customers get scammed, they often take their business elsewhere, driving up churn rates and customer acquisition costs. In financial services, a popular target for phishing and account takeover scams, [28% of customers leave their bank ](URL unauthorized account activity. For all industries, Deloitte projects a [30% rise in customer attrition after a company has a cybercrime incident](URL with above-normal attrition rates for the next three years. Theres harder to quantify relationship damage too, as brands involved in email scams experience the kind of press that simply cannot be considered good press. Consumers who see new stories about data breaches or warnings from the FTC may avoid those brands going forward. Making matters worse, email can see a drop in ROI if customers stop opening messages because they cannot trust the safety of them. ## A Smarter Approach to Email Security Relying on end-users to decide who to trust in the inbox is a setup for costly losses.

I got blackmailed and I immediately went to the local authorities (Cyber Crime Department) to deal with him. The moment I explained to the investigator what happened, he was able to know immediately the criminal's nationality. I was surprised how he knew that fast and told me you're not the first victim. He asked for the false account he created of me to take it down. I also reported the account for impersonation to Instagram and they responded quickly and took it down. Still, I don't feel safe knowing that this monster exists and still in the loose. Lucky, I was able to find his Instagram account that he used to trick me. It is still active and can be found if you search it. I immediately reported the account to Instagram. Sadly, they responded with this: ""While we reviewed the account you reported for impersonation and found it does not violate our Community Guidelines, reports like yours are an important part of making Instagram a safe and welcoming place for everyone."" Does that make any sense? I didn't give up and I've used their official form to report the blackmail threat and explained the story in the comment section. Let's just wait and see what they'll have to say about that once they read what happened with me. As for the Cyber Crime Department, I told the investigator why do you guys let this monster continue feed on his victims. Why don't you stop him. He told me (in a cold way) that we can't do anything, because he's not with us in our country. You want to report him, go fly to his country and contact their authorities. Can you guys believe that? Is this supposed to be the guy I should feel safe and comfortable with? God! I still didn't want to give up hope and I'll do everything within my power to bring him down and destroy his miserable life the way he destroyed others. I've contacted their embassy we have in our country. The woman told me write down an official letter explaining to us what happened with any evidence you have of the crime and we'll see what we can do about it. I feel like this is the lamest excuse to investigate a crime and I don't know how long it will take them or if they will really pursue the criminal.

Obviously, youd take your time to prepare for it. There are many reasons to prepare for that job interview. First, you want to show the interviewers that you have what it takes to be given that job. Also, you want to sell yourself to the interviewers for you to beat other interviewees. But what about when you have received an invitation to attend a specific conference or when you decide to attend a conference of your desire, what would you do about it? You just play by the old rules and prepare for it. Just as the speakers in the conference prepare to give their talks, the attendees also need to prepare for that talk. There is usually something crucial that is being discussed in that conference means that you should be ready to gain as much as you can from it. Well, June 1st and 2nd will be days for the International Conference on Cyber Crime and Legal Compliance. In this conference, a lot of topics will be discussed to help business owners and institutions stay safe from the threats and attacks from cyber crimes. So, if you are planning to attend, you will need to be ready for it. In this article, we will be talking about the things that will help you be well prepared for the cybercrime and legal compliance conference. Without wasting any time, lets jump right in, shall we? **Getting Ready for the Conference** **1.** **Prepare in Advance** Too many times, people make the wrong mistakes because they fail to plan in advance. If you want to get the best of the conference on cybercrime and legal compliance, youll need to start planning as soon as now. If you already planned to attend it, you are on the right track. One thing that you need to know about this conference is that it has a limited attendee number of only 300 people. This number includes students and regular visitors. This is an international conference; so many people will be attending it. You can imagine the whole world is invited, but only 300 people will get seats at the conference. You dont want to wait until the eve of the conference so that you can try booking a seat. Without any doubt, all the seats will be sold out at that time. The world is well dominated by technology, so IT is an important topic in most organizations and businesses. You dont know how many institutions will send reps to that conference. Therefore, you need to buy the tickets to the conference as soon as now. [Click here](URL to buy the tickets online. The site is in Georgian Kartuli Ena, but you can use the Google translate feature to translate the entire page. For the record, a ticket for regular attendees is 350GEL, which is approximately $129. On the other hand, students will need to pay 200GEL that converts to around $78. When you have your ticket ready, you stand a better chance of attending the conference without any failure or disappointment. **2.** **Consider Your Priorities/Why Do You Want to Go?** It is one thing to book a ticket for the conference and another to have a reason for going. Some plan to go so that they can learn about cybersecurity and how to curb the common cybercrimes. Others consider going for the sake of learning legal compliance. Still, there are others who consider attending a conference a hobby. Such people would never want to miss any conference regardless of what it is about. The conference freaks are usually knowledge hungry, and they just want to learn something new. They dont need to apply it anywhere, but they want to stock up their knowledge library with new content. Be sure of why you want to go to the conference before you even pay that ticket. **3.** **Consider What Your Business /Institution Needs** Do you manage a specific institution or business? What are the challenges you are facing that youd like the conference to help you fix them? In this case, you will need to highlight the challenges of your institution or business. Is it common malicious attacks from online activities? Does your system keep on being hacked by unknown people? Does your institution or business short of data security? Have there been data breaches in your business? Maybe you just want to educate your IT team and make them understand the cybersecurity better. It could also be for your personal gain. You must be able to determine the challenges facing your business or institution based on IT or legal compliance. When you find these issues, you can know how you will benefit from the conference. The conference will touch on many things including the sensitive issues for data protection security, the regulations, risks, and norms of cybersecurity. You will also know how to prevent data breaches, economic sanctions, and cybercrime from attacking your business or institution. Ensure that you consider the challenges of your business and how the conference will solve them in the end. **4.** **Prepare Your List of Questions** Well, you should know that this international conference will have a question and answer session with the main speakers. At this point, you can ask the speakers whatever questions that relate to internet security and legal compliance. In this case, you can start writing down the questions that youd ask the main speakers. Write as many questions as you want, but ensure that they are related to IT and legal compliance. This will help you prepare for the conference and also ensure that you go back with enough information from the conference. **5.** **Contact Any Person You Want to Meet Before the Conference** Okay, you are not going for a meet-and-greet event. However, there is always that person or people that youd love to meet at the conference. In this case, you can try contacting them ahead to time to meet them before the conference kicks off. If it is a prominent person, it would be better to reaching out to them ahead of time. During the conference, it is always difficult to meet them and have a one-one conversation because they will be busy sharing what they have with the attendees. Whether you have a mutual connection with the person, blood relation, or you just want to meet them for being notable people in the industry, ensure that you meet them before the conference. Luckily, there are three or so weeks left to the event; so you have enough time to plan for a meeting. **6.** **Finish Your Work Early/Delegate** If you want to get the most of the international cybercrime and legal compliance conference, you will need to be focused enough. Suppose you have a junk of work, try to finish it early to avoid having to work as you attend the conference. Today, business persons use their phones to work, which lets them get the business going using their mobile phones. When you are at the conference, you might want to keep your phone away and focus on what is being taught at the conference. The only time you will be using the phone is when you want to connect online with the other attendees and experts there. By the way, there will be a chance to network with IT and law experts at the conference, where you can connect with them online and learn more from them. But you can use the phone to record an audio or even video. However, you will need to confirm if it is okay to record, especially the video recordings. If you are allowed to record videos, use that chance to record the conference for future references. You can even use the Facebook Live feature to host the conference to your team back in the business/institution. But since this is a paid conference, you might not be allowed to do so. Either way, it never hurts to ask. **7.** **Be Open-Minded** One of the reasons for going to the international conference for internet security and legal compliance is to learn something new. For this reason, you will need to have an open mind. Get ready to be challenged by other people there. Even if you are an IT guru, dont go to the conference with the aim of showing everybody else how knowledgeable you are. Suppose the speaker states something that you had a different opinion on, do not cut her short and show other attendees how wrong the speaker is. Here is why you should meet the speaker earlier before the conference starts. If you specifically are there for the cybercrime needs, dont just stay in that circle. Instead, you can try to learn something else from other attendees at the conference. For instance, you can share your management skills with someone else who runs a business or institution. Keep in mind that there might be other attendees, even students, who know something that can benefit you and your business. **8.** **Remember Why You Are There** This point connects to the first and the seventh points. You already know why you are going to the conference. Mostly, it is because you want to learn something from the speakers and the other attendees. You are NOT THERE TO COMPETE. Therefore, dont go with an aggressive attitude or else you will end up not learning what is taught at the conference. Be friendly, share ideas, and pick up useful points that you would apply back in your business or institution. **9.** **Utilize Any Promising Moment** Well, this conference will attract 300 people from different places. Out of the 300, you can be sure of meeting some that you will automatically connect. If you happen to find yourself in a moment that you get the chance to develop a friendship, utilize it to the maximum. That friendship that you despise might lead to a future relationship. Here, you can even meet to start something that can lead to international success. If it is starting an IT company together to joining heads to better an existing institution or business, ensure that you utilize the chance to the maximum. **10.** **Consider the Aftermath** How do you see your business will be after the conference, what do you plan to do after the conference? Will you connect with one of the students at the conference and hire them in your company? Do you plan to share the knowledge with your team when you get back and teach them all that you learned at the conference? How do you plan to solve the existing challenges in your business with what you were taught at the conference on cybersecurity and legal compliance? Consider all these factors and be sure of how you will handle it all after you get back. Regardless of what you want to do, ensure that you benefit to the fullest after the conference is over. Always have a plan of what you want to do after the conference. **11.** **Understand the IT \[and law\]Terms** Im not saying that you should start taking a course in IT. But, you need to have a clue about the common IT terms. You see, there will be two main speakers at the conference. One speaker is a former Head of the Public Defender Service of England and Wales (Gaynor Ogden Sutton), who will talk about legal compliance. The other main speaker is a co-founder of CySec (cybersecurity) Cyber Educational Center (Maka Petriashvili), who will be speaking about cybersecurity. These experts will regularly use IT and law terms, so you should be familiar with them before you attend the conference. Above all, you can learn some Georgian Kartuli Ena because the conference will be held at the Old Tbilisi Hotel, Tbilisi. You might find it helpful to learn a few basic phrases of the local language. Also, ensure that you have the local currency when going to the conference. Have enough money that you will use for accommodation, dinner, and breakfast. The conference only offers lunch.

So, Ive decided I want to go back and finish a second BSc in Cyber Security, my first BA was in Political Science focusing on International Relations, specifically counter terrorism. I now work for the Feds in America. Ive fallen in love with the cyber training Ive received from basic security to crypto, and my personal favorite network security. I want to get my degree in Cyber, and Im already working on getting my Sec+ later next month. My question is, is the degree worth it? Work pays for a good amount of school, but I would still need to take 5-8k in loans to finish. My undergrad resulted in no debt, so I have nothing really in the debt department. I want to work in this sector, since Im noticing a trend in crime moving to the cyber infrastructure at work. I wanna get ahead of it, and maybe transfer to a job working in Cyber. Do you guys think the degree is worth it? Thanks!"

I have wanted to know how to do this since i was a little kid, but... i am also very lazy. so i enjoyed learning it in a class. He mentioned that the legality of lockpicks in the US is fuzzy and handled state-by-state, meaning some states it's illegal to even own them, in some states it is legal, and some states it is legal to own them, but having them on you is considered ""intent to commit a crime"". i am in a state that falls into that last category. so how would i go about buying and owning a lockpicking kit safely? Is ther i (long term) get a lockpicking license? what is the experience of the lockpickers here that live in one of these states in the US? "

41,cyber-crime,cybersecurity,Top Cyber Attack Vectors of 2018?,5,832yqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/832yqa/top_cyber_attack_vectors_of_2018/,2018-03-09 12:35:16,"In 2017, Natural Disasters costed the Global Economy $300 Billion, while Cyber Crime closed in on $4 Trillion. In the same period, Global Cyber Security Spend was $86.4 Billion. Many organizations facing a data-security incident struggle to understand how or why their organization was targeted in an attack. Most simply believe they are too small or too obscure to be targeted by malicious cyber actors. Even larger, well-known businesses are lulled into complacency, mistaking years without a major incident as evidence that their business is an unlikely target, or believing that a small corner of their business, perhaps the new cloud instance theyre testing, will go unnoticed. They believe With bigger or more prominent fish in the ocean, our relative obscurity is a strong line of defense. But this reasoning catastrophically misunderstands how victims of cyber attacks typically become victims, and how easy it is for attackers to find and compromise soft targets across the internet. While some victims are targeted for specific purposes, especially by nation-state actors, the vast majority are not. More often, they are opportunistic victims or victims of collateral damage directed at others. Understanding how attackers target victims is critical to proper network defense and to accurately assessing an organizations risk. Targets of Opportunity We will highlight four common ways attackers find their victims: phishing campaigns, watering hole attacks, malvertising, and mass internet scans for vulnerable or open systems. Knowing how these techniques find victims is key to understanding that every organization with internet-accessible systems and data is a target. 1. Phishing Campaigns will be the leading attack vector for the #1 cause of business bankruptcy in 2018  Wire Transfer and Equipment Purchase Fraud. Phishing campaigns blanket the internet with emails containing malicious attachments or links. They target individuals and organizations of all sizes, and often worm their way from one victim to the next using victims compromised accounts and address book contacts to spread, making the phishing campaign that much more effective because malicious messages arrive from a trusted or known source. The purpose behind many of these attacks is to harvest users credentials for sale or use in follow-on attacks. Other phishing campaigns with malicious attachments install ransomware; malware that collects banking details, credentials or other sensitive data; or remote access tools, signaling to the attacker when a catch is on the line.Despite increased awareness and training, this attack method remains popular because it works, and our experience demonstrates that any organization can fall victim to these attacks. 2. Watering Hole Attacks are where attackers compromise a legitimate website (the watering hole AKA YOUR website), inject malicious code into the site and then wait for victims to visit it. When a victim arrives at the site, the injected code checks the visitors browser and plug-ins for vulnerabilities and exploits them in the background. These attacks sometimes target specific industries or categories of individuals (targeting government contractors, for example, by compromising a site covering a related subject), but they also often target the general population by compromising widely visited pages like news sites. Victims are often surprised to learn these attacks can compromise a users system as soon as the victim visits the compromised site. The user doesnt have to click on a link, download anything or take other action  when a user visits the compromised site with a vulnerable browser or plug-in, the attack is complete. Adobe Flash is a well-known plug-in with a history of serious and frequent vulnerabilities. Despite these known vulnerabilities and plans to retire the plug-in next year, we see frequent examples of attackers targeting this plug-in to compromise users systems. 3. Malvertising (malicious advertising) is a close cousin of the watering hole attack, but instead of compromising the site that unsuspecting victims visit, the attacker compromises advertising space on the legitimate site and populates the space with malicious code. When the malicious advertisement loads into a users vulnerable browser, the code compromises the users system behind the scenes, again with no additional action by or notice to the user. 4. Mass Internet Scans are perhaps the most opportunistic way attackers find victims on the internet is through mass scans of the entire internet for publicly exposed vulnerabilities. Although internet-wide scans may sound impractical or sophisticated, several tools and services automate the process, making it easy for even unsophisticated attackers. There are many tools available for this attack vector  most of them automated to find cloud storage locations like Amazon S3 buckets, your WordPress website, or even your home Linksys router that you never changed the admin password on. The scenarios described above create serious financial, legal, and reputational risk.

I have post across a number of similar subreddits. Over the coming weeks/months I will be conducting a research project (around 15-20k words) to conclude my information security masters. At present I have a few high-level ideas of subjects that interest me, mainly surrounding either cyber/info sec risk management or cyber crime. I dont however know how I could build on them to the depth of 15k+ words and what exact hypothesis/avenue to take. I have quite thoroughly browsed pages such as this and popular blogs, but am still lacking that direction I need. Below are a few ideas, I would welcome any further suggestions or expansions. Please note, I do not have a strong technical background. Thanks! - The idea that cyber risk management needs to move away from a compliance based approach (such as outdated frameworks and un-agile working) to a more pro-active approach (that approach I am not entirely sure on!) - The need for risk management to become automated e.g. dashboards and real-time metrics to allow an enterprise level understanding of threats and risks. Meaningful data and information, rather than bloated paper based inefficiency. - The motivation behind young people becoming cyber criminals (although this may be more of a criminology / psychology subject rather than info sec) - The idea that cyber crime is undermining the digital economy (erosion of trust in, and growing fear of, digital technology) - Understanding your supply chain and the complex connectivity - Blockchains potential impact on security &amp; privacy (however my limited technical knowledge may be an issue) "

Decryption doesn't work even if you pay** It looks like [this Mac ransomware](URL is spreading by posing as a software license crack in torrents.

W2 scams are no joke and really mess with the employees. Please be careful when handling this sort of info. &amp;nbsp; **Do You Know What Your Cyber Insurance Really Covers?** This is just a reminder to be aware of what is and isn't covered by your cyber insurance. I highly recommend that you speak with an agent and do a review of the coverages BEFORE it hits the fan. I recently learned that while notification can be the most expensive part of a breach, it's often not covered by default in the policy. To add to that, cyber insurance is still in its infancy, so coverage is rarely standardized. Don't blame the insurance companies for this as it's a very new type of risk, it's your job to know, with their help, what you are paying for. [Take for example the P.F. Chang's breach](URL The $1.7 million cost of defense against customer lawsuits were covered, but the roughly $2 million in fees and fines imposed by credit card issuers to pay for notifications to cardholders, reissuance of credit cards, and other costs was not.

The sad part is, you can protect yourself pretty well with basic ""security 101"" stuff like segmenting the network, ""least privilege"" access, weapons-grade backups and [quality awareness training/simulated phishing](URL You don't need to burn money to protect yourself. * 85 percent of those infected had systems forced offline for at least a week * 1/3rd of cases resulted in data being inaccessible for a month or more * 15 percent found that their data was completely unrecoverable * 63 percent of orgs have no official ransomware policy in place * About 50 percent of victims paid more than 3000 ($3700) in ransom * SMBs usually paid between 500 ($621) and 1500 ($1864) &amp;nbsp; **Roxana Police Department is done cleaning up after ransomware attacks** I swear, [small town police departments](URL can't wait to get hit by ransomware. I keep seeing it over and over again. In this case, ""the work of sophisticated hackers who seek out vulnerabilities in digital networks, enter computer systems and encrypt important data..."" (a.k.a. a piece of malware sent in a phishing email) was inconvenient rather than crippling. Based on the article and the lack of desire to share any info, along with the sensationalizing of the attack above, I'd say they are pretty embarrassed about it. &amp;nbsp; **Madison, WI Requires Unique Locking Devices On Gas Pumps Due To Skimmers** I can't say that I like a lot of government involvement and additional regulations, but I appreciate that [they are trying to stop the issue](URL It's far too easy for folks to install skimmers and while this doesn't solve the issue or counter skimmer overlays, it does take a step to help.

No, I dont mean your customer banks details or copyright music or state secrets. I am, of course, referring to the International Standard for Information security ISO 27001.

The controls have been assembled into a unified framework so that they can be more easily addressed and reviewed. All terribly dull and awful of course. But wait! In the right hands, these standards are extremely useful and one would assume that the goal would be to distribute them to the IT Community as quickly as possible so that their recommendations might be implemented. Distributed not only in their raw (and ghastly) PDF format, but in CSV or Excel format which a security professional might actually be able to use. Not a bit of it. The guys at The International Standards Organisation (ISO) have apparently got the wrong end of the stick and have done their damnedest to ensure that it is nye on impossible to get a hint of the content of these standards without putting ones hand in ones pocket. The ISO27001 documents appear to be the only documents in the world protected by every single one of the bloody ISO27001 controls even right down to: If you try to google it you get a millions companies trying to flog you something before you find any meat about the standards themselves. In my experience, many companies have a go at IT security and end up with poorly written controls and incomplete coverage. By the time the control text reaches the techy it is frequently gobbledegook. A simple solution would be to make these standards free too everyone. What is frustrating is that the work to devise a solid control framework has been done; the text exists and is owned by the International Standards Organisation. They will argue that it is reasonable that they, and their associated companies, charge for copies of standards as they need to be maintained and updated but, given the prevalence of cyber-crime and the threat posed to everyone, one might be forgiven for thinking that this is an emergency and copies of ISO 27001 in useable formats should be made available for free download on the ISO web site.
