I obviously keep an ear to the ground for big CVE notifications, and patch accordingly along with keeping all of our systems up to date, and secured with varying brands of endpoint security (I work for an MSP, so we're talking about multiple client sites). I always feel we should be doing more, and it's not through a lack of trying. Others in my organisation install endpoint security and then consider that machine ""secure"". I've been aware of the basics for a little while and have them deployed at most if not all of the sites I handle, stuff like renaming VSSAdmin to a random filename, avoiding local admin rights at all times, stopping files executing from user profile locations and temp directories etc... I'm keen to find articles covering the bare essentials for things like locking an environment down to make ransomware and other malicious software have a harder time should it get onto any of the networks. Is there any sort of cheat sheets out there, or good repositories of knowledge for this sort of thing. At the moment a lot of the hustle and bustle has subsided, we're still working remotely, so I've got some time to learn and test new things and deploy it out to clients."

So, I decided to pose an open ended discussion around this topic. **Please remain civil, and remember that your threat model is not my threat model, and other Org's threat model may not even compare to yours. Just because something has always been a certain way doesn't mean it is always right.** **So, hopefully, we can have an actual discussion around this topic, if not mods feel free to delete, but know I came into this with the intent to have an actual professional discussion on this topic.** For my last several jobs, local admin rights has been a low risk, and accepted. I work in high tech, and have for the past decade or so. Before that I did SMB/retail tech, and some government work (also had a consultant side biz for a couple years too). So, my point of view will be from a tech company. We give everyone local admin, on Windows and macOS. We do put in full UAC controls on win10 so it matches the experience on macOS, where anything that needs elevated permissions will prompt for admin creds. We do this because we want to enable teams to do their jobs, install their own solutions and software and self manage their environments. This reduces IT headcount, it reduces help desk tickets, and it is overall a much better employee experience. with IdP and SAML auth, with forced trusted devices and forced MFA, local admin does not get you much in terms of data exfiltration, as your access has to be granted and is controlled on the back end. We deployed RATs and had an external red team try to exploit the local admin, and while yes access to some local data happened, access to our cloud solutions did not. They were unable to bypass MFA. This doesn't mean it is bullet proof (there was a big SAML CVE recently), but what it does mean is that we have so many layers of compensating controls around data, that local admin doesn't really matter. I understand that this model does not work for every type of Org. If you are in Fintech or K-12 EDU you probably won't give local admin rights to things. If you are in high tech you probably will. So, it varies from Org to Org, but also from industry to industry. My professional opinion will be to focus on better data, security and compensating controls over local admin."

I manage the IT department at a large school in Australia, I've recently setup a Honeypot on the BYOD wireless network to identify if any students are doing something they shouldn't. Within about 20 minutes I got two hits; Something was scanning the entire network and accessing ports 80, 443, 445, 1900, 2869 and 3389. Not only were they scanning, they were actively probing for vulnerabilities and delivering malicious payloads to the Honeypot server. In one instance CVE-2012-0152 was used in an attempted RDP DDoS attack. After some panic and investigation I discovered that Avast has a ""feature"" called Wi-Fi Inspector. This basically scans the users wireless network and tests for vulnerabilities, this feature is on by default but can be disabled. We have over 3000 students with BYOD devices, many with Avast installed scanning the network at least once per day. This is creating a huge overhead on our wireless network and seems like Avast is acting like a virus itself, especially seeing that the thing is crafting payloads and actively accessing resources it's not authorised to access. IMO this is a malicious practice and constitutes as a cyber security incident.

I was recently considering some monitoring software from a vendor, but it seems they are new... new to the point I would call them a startup. They're only mentioned online in two websites, one being their own and the other is a seemingly a shitty website that I suspect they brought up as well to give themselves more credibility. Their tech actually seems pretty useful. It charts software vulnerabilities, how quickly you update after a CVE is released, monitors port events, permission changes, and security group changes. My last company utilized a similar software but it looks like this has a better UI in addition to more monitoring capability. They also have some Governance, Risk and Compliance framework that would go nicely to bring our an org we just acquired up to code. I have been scouring the internet, just trying to find a track record for the company, but like I mentioned, they are have very little presence online besides their own website. When I asked for references, they seemed to stumble and say they would ask some current customers if it was okay if they shared that info and would get back to me. I haven't heard anything yet. I would like to do a technical demo, but am having trouble justifying loading any software onto my servers without it being thoroughly vetted. I am new to my System Administrator role and would love some advice from some resident experts. Thanks in advance, I appreciate any help."

Users might not notice, but with so much of an emphasis on work from home these days it's probably worth checking on. MS Remote Desktop Gateway (2016 and 2019) can be configured to use UDP connections for a dramatic improvement in user experience. (if you are not yet allowing UDP 3391 to your RD Gateways -- you should look into it). We have a bunch of these configured to use UDP and it's been great! As you may also know, MS recently released a patch to update a couple of vulnerabilities CVE-2020-0609 and CVE-2020-610. We have noted on a number of servers (a dozen or more so far -- all that we have checked) that these patches seem to break the use of UDP transport via the gateway and it requires some manual intervention to begin using UDP transport again. We have observed, and I believe that after the MS patches are applied and the server is rebooted: * The RD Gateway comes up and back on line and clients can connect (https) -- but UDP is never used * If clients don't check the connection quality from the banner -- there is no indication on the client side that UDP is not in use, but connection performance is noticeably diminished * On the server the Monitoring under the RD Gateway shows connections negotiated ""transport"" as HTTP (not HTTP AND UDP connections per user * When opened, Remote Desktop Gateway Manager shows the error message banner that an SSL Certificate is not installed (but it is installed and it is working for http connections) * The banner message is the same message you see before you install the SSL on a newly configured server that says ""SERVERNAME is not yet fully configured as a RD Gateway server. To access the settings required to complete RD Gateway configuration, click the link provided in each configuration task."" And ""A server certificate is not yet installed or selected"" * If you REINSTALL the RD Gateway SSL certificate -- all connections going forward WILL connect and negotiate UDP and client performance returns to normal! This has led to a huge bump in performance and increased user experience as we manually go back and make this change. I am interested to hear if this helps anyone else."

Specifically, an deserialization flaw exists in the bind_ace2() function of the pulmonary/alveoli.c component when the cell replication software fails to verify unauthenticated protein message codes. The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to send crafted oxygen packets containing serialized mRNA objects via respiratory protocol to inject shellcode, triggering remote code execution on the cellular application level. Successful exploitation may lead to local escalation of privilege and lateral movement to other hosts on the same broadcast address. In certain cases where system uptime is greater than 2147483648 seconds (~68 years), a denial of service (resource exhaustion) may occur in the immunity subsystem due to excessive cytokine requests, leading to system hangs or unrecoverable crashes. Mitigations: There is no known security patch available at this time. Workarounds: Limit external access by firewalling the front and back door ports. If WAN access is mandatory, it is advised that /95 or greater subnet mask be worn."

For a long while, we ran our own vulnerability scanner to scan clients sites/firewalls/servers and provide security reports to them etc (part of our MSP offering basically). This ran the older OpenVAS scanner, and older GVM versions. When I set that up years ago, I remeber having a very hard time getting the SCAP/.CVE/NVT/CERT data updated (and keeping it up to date). Recently, the old scanner version in use on that server was causinga load of issues, mostly that scans were now bugged out, and 80% of them would have the status ""Stopped at 1%"" for no reason, and I'd be unable to re-scan that target. The only way to fix, was to upgrade to the latest GVM and OpenVAS scanner versions. So I did that, but it's a destructive upgrade, it doesnt retain scan/target/task/schedule data. In light of that, I blew the entire system away and reinstalled the latest GVM and OpenVAS scanner components. Everythigns working fine, new scanner is faster, GVM is less glitchy, but I have one issue... The method of updating SCAP/CVE/NVT/CERT data is unreliable. The initial setup stages (running gvm-setup at console) did the initial data sync, and from there Feed Status said it was up to date. Great. Now I'm 3 days on, and I have alerts saying there are 200 new NVT's and 40 new CVE's, Feed Status says 3days old. I run: `/usr/sbin/greenbone-scapdata-sync` `/usr/sbin/greenbone-certdata-sync` ...these run, and I can see in ps aux that there are tasks running relating to the resync of data: `gvmd: Syncing SCAP` `gvmd: Updating NVT cache` `gvmd: Reloading NVTs` The SCAP one takes some 50minutes.. And then completes, as do the others. But I go back to Feed Status, and it still says 3 days old. I've restarted GSAD, and GVMD, yet the Feed Status still says out of date. Anyone have any suggestions on how to update the vuln data without needing to run gvm-setup again? INFO: `OpenVAS Scanner v6.0.0` `GVMD v8.0.0` `GSAD v8.0.0`"

Here's the summary and a link with more info. Yay, my day turned into a patching day... meh. &amp;#x200B; The NSA has discovered a critical vulnerability (CVE-2020-0601) affecting Microsoft Windows cryptographic functionality. The certificate validation vulnerability allows an attacker to undermine how Windows verifies cryptographic trust and can enable remote code execution. **The vulnerability affects Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016/2019** as well as applications that rely on Windows for trust functionality. Exploitation of the vulnerability allows attackers to defeat trusted network connections and deliver executable code while appearing as legitimately trusted entities. Examples where validation of trust may be impacted include: * HTTPS connections * Signed files and emails * Signed executable code launched as user-mode processes The vulnerability places Windows systems at risk to a broad range of exploitation vectors. NSA assesses the vulnerability to be severe and that sophisticated cyber actors will understand the underlying flaw very quickly and, if exploited, would render the previously mentioned platforms as fundamentally vulnerable. The consequences of not patching the vulnerability are severe and widespread. Remote exploitation tools will likely be made quickly and widely available. Rapid adoption of the patch is the only known mitigation at this time and should be the primary focus for all network owners. &amp;#x200B; Additional information about this vulnerability can be found here: [URL"

Before anyone asks why this wasn't picked up in testing - we can't afford a production environment. So - onto the mad-arsed problem. So we use Remote Desktop Services to access a bespoke Azure application. This morning it couldn't be accessed. The error varied on the browser, but they were all variations of This site isn't trusted. Also, our AV endpoint software was flagging the sites as category 'Unknown' (which are blocked by default unless exempted), which it wasn't doing on Friday. So I spent ages adding exemptions for all the URLs that needed to be accessed, resyncing workstations and servers, and still nothing worked, and the URLs still kept getting flagged. Turns out the fix was to also add all these URLs into the Safe Zone for the Servers via GPO \[Windows Components/Internet Explorer/Internet Control Panel/Security Page/Site to Zone Assignment List\] A GPupdate /Force and a reboot of the RDS servers later, and everything was running fine.

We set it up in July two years ago, free for unlimited devices, etc. They gave us a ""free"" license for unlimited seats 365 days at a time. I assumed that it was free because we were essentially beta testers and the product was limited in features in the beginning. I will say it had grown into a somewhat impressive suite for a free product and switching to a paid model was inevitable. Their ""Advanced Endpoint Protection"" and other services are what were supposed to cost if you decided to use them which we did not. So apparently at the end of 2019 they decide they are going to start billing for their ""Endpoint Manager"" (RMM) service for accounts over 50 devices. 0-50 are now free however once you go over 50 devices you pay for all devices at $.80/ endpoint/month. I thought because in my portal I had a ""free"" license good thru July I was golden and could either seek funding or find another solution. Their sales team reached out to me at the end of January saying I need to enter billing information because I would soon be billed for usage. I went back and forth explained that we should be good thru July, he seemed to have no idea what I was talking about. I sent screenshots of our portal and the license good thru July. The sales guy agreed we should be good and he wasn't sure why I was on his list to call. We hung up and I thought I had until the end of June to get something budgeted for remote desktop. Cool, I can do that... A few hours later they send an invoice to my email! I'm thinking WTF! I login to the portal and they have yanked the free license from my account with a balance due for the devices in January! In my eyes this is a terrible business practice. I understand they are changing their pricing structure and need to make money. That's cool and all but to just take away licenses, regardless if they were free, seems to be a terrible business practice. Grandfather us in and honor what you gave out. This makes me want to no longer do business with them regardless as to how low their price point is.

I've had a support case open towards Symantec for 5 months now regarding this issue and it's affecting 8K workstations running SEP with SEPM in pull mode, It's my belief that this is an issue affecting more customers and I'm reaching out to try to get this confirmed or denied. If more happen to have the same issue(s) Im hopping this will result in more support ticket's to Symantec. The issue is causing frequent short bursts of High file I/O, CPU load and an high amount of unnecessary web requests. It's possible that yous, like our environment are able to handle this additional load fairly well and that the issue has gone unnoticed, but it's clear that something is wrong when you dig down to it. Based on Windows performance recordings, this is caused by ccSvcHst.exe. From the looks of it it's reading definition files very frequent which is causing the issue. (~2-3 times a minute) On some rare cases, the issue can only be seen once an hour (Same as our normal SEP heartbeat interval) File I/O and CPU utilization from windows performance recording: [URL It happens 2-3 times a minute and is only active for about 4 seconds each time. So not constant load. With the specs i5-6300U/16GB RAM/SSD, CPU load reaches 25-32% for SEP. Looking at the cve-actions log which writes information at the same time as the issue occurs.

The 469 response is regarding ATP which is a service we do not use with SEP. log location: C:\ProgramData\Symantec\Symantec Endpoint Protection\SEP_VERSION\Data\Logs To me, it looks like Symantec is running in a constant accelerated heartbeat. According to Symantecs own documentation: *Due to corrupt definitions, SEPM cannot create delta definitions for the SEP clients. The ""Content Pending"" message is sent by SEPM to SEP clients when it is preparing a Delta definition set for the client. When a SEP client receives the ""469"" code, it will put itself in an accelerated heartbeat mode, waiting for SEPM to finish the creation of the Delta.* *Source: URL *The SEP client heartbeat interval is normally controlled by communications policies set at the Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager (SEPM). In certain situations, the SEP client will decrease its heartbeat interval to a value between 0 and 60 seconds. The SEP client can enter an accelerated heartbeat period for several reasons:* 1. While waiting for content to be prepared by the SEPM for download 1. When the client's configuration has changed 1. When the client has resumed from hibernation 1. After the SEP client's profile is updated 1. After an Internet exception occurs while trying to get an updated index2.xml file from the SEPM *Source: URL According to Symantec themselves, there should be a build in hardcoded bypass for the ""pending content / 469 responses"" we get, but it seems like it's either isn't working or something else is causing the accelerated heartbeat. According to Nexthink monitoring software, high file I/O warnings can be seen in the same interval which entries is generated in the cve-actions log.

I have a coworker who I feel has demonstrated what would be considered either a willful ignorance or straight up gross negligence and in doing so, undermines my ability to do my job. Allow me to provide context, this looks like a novel but covers two incidents. Apologies, but I need guidance here and there really is no TL:DR for the kind of negligence I feel this is. Last year I came on board as a member of a small I.T team servicing about 200 users and a rather large network of devices. I work as the Network Administrator but also provide some desktop support and interact with some systems outside the usual ""Network"" admin type role. My co-worker is classified as a Database administrator but may be classified better under a DevOps type role and our boss is much in the same. My issue comes from the fact that this year we have experienced two very serious incidents which, without hyperbole, posed a threat that could have crippled the business for weeks on end. Potentially killing the business itself. Sounds serious, right? Well, during these incidents the DBA mentioned above has done nothing but essentially attack me, undermine me and drag his feet. ------- **Incident 1** The first was a security incident in which a banking virus and crypto-malware tag teamed our network. I will skip the gory details for another time but the end result was we made a full recovery and everything was saved, we didn't lose a single system. ""We"" is a strong word though, because during this process while I lead the recovery effort full force the DBA was incredibly unhelpful. You might ask ""Well why is the DBA involved anyways?"" The answer is because our boss said so and we are as I said, a small team. During morning briefings on the situation, the DBA would openly and repeatedly question my ability to handle the situation, he stated that he felt I was being ""alarmist"". When I explained that I was in fact certified to handle this exact situation he scoffed and dropped it finally. On another day, in response to one of my reports giving details as to how the Virus threat worked he stated during a meeting &gt; ""why are you using big words? Your words don't make any sense."". The words in question, which I had him point out, were the virus name, ""advanced malware"", ""propogate"" and finally ""attack vector"". In fact, in that same meeting when I provided a CVE report, based off a sample of the virus I had collected, that detailed the virus and my suggestions for how we can best tackle it, he openly stated &gt; ""You're wrong, we have no way of knowing this is the virus in question. It's actually **other** virus. This isn't even a big deal."" Despite having direct evidence in front of him that was corroborated by multiple sources. I at one point after this meeting tried to walk him through the process personally, explaining my findings, my steps taken and everything else so he would be able to work with me. Halfway through he threw his hands up and walked out of my office exclaiming &gt;""This isn't a movie, virus attacks like this don't actually happen like you think."" I'm serious, that's a real quote. Beyond this he offered no help during this situation beyond criticism and then when the final post mortem process occured, he again criticized me for ""taking this whole thing too seriously."" I don't really understand which part of losing all of our business and bank accounts wasn't serious for him, but alright. My boss who usually is incredibly helpful and supportive has never responded to anything concerning this besides telling me afterwards. ""He is not equipped to handle these situations. You are."" I'm sure that was meant to make me feel better but I felt bitter that while my boss and I worked 70 hours two weeks in a row, the DBA left on time every day and came in no earlier than usual. I felt cheated somehow. He had offered no assistance in any form but escaped without issue. Everything above occurred over the course of two weeks and there is plenty more left out, but I at the time wrote it off as a stressful incident for all involved. Until yesterday. ------ **Incident 2** Four months after this last incident, we arrive at this week. If you check my post history you will see that last night I had to do an emergency RAID array rebuild. This RAID array contained every single VM and service we have. No failover device. No backups. 2 of 4 disks inside the RAID10 array had failed and the stripes were all that remained. But I digress. Upon discovery of this issue earlier this week, I stepped forward to lead the response as this was now *written into my job duties* as a result of my work last time around. The DBA did not seem enthused about this. Our boss was (and is) out of the country on vacation in a remote area with reception that he only gets once or twice a day. As it stands I have been the fill in while he's out. I looked at the issue as critical, if any further disks failed in the array then we were looking at a total business loss. Potentially for weeks or months. This was the sort of disaster scenario we had warned management about months ago but they said the chances were too low to pass funding. But I digress. Taking in mind the seriousness of the situation, I assessed that we did not have enough on hand spare drives to rebuild the array and that the one drive we had was from the same batch as the failing ones. I managed an emergency call to our boss who instructed me to immediately drive two hours away to make a direct pickup from a vendor warehouse so we could do an emergency rebuild right away and not risk any further data loss. I want to make a quick note. &gt;The DBA understood I would be gone a minimum of 4 hours and the building would be without on hand help for at least 2 1/2 of those if he left as scheduled. Our team policy is the building cannot be without support. We signed on with the understanding there would be late hours, we will be on call and all that involved. Instead of covering the building, he left. I can't fault him for working his shift hours, but this just brought back up the same bitter taste I had from the last time around. I couldn't help but feel I was left pulling the weight of the team. Before I left, the DBA made a comment to me that it was pointless to go tonight and we were... &gt;""...really under no risk, the stripes are fine, it's no worse that two disks failed than if one had failed. I told CTO the same, so why are you driving?"" When I attempted to walk him through (see last time I did this) the map showing how we had no backups or failover left if the RAID failed. He began yelling loudly that this was ridiculous. Finally he walks out and very loudly exclaimed to the whole office... &gt;""I'm sick of this alarmist bullshit."" And that's what he stuck with. He sent multiple emails to the management team, including the CTO, explaining there was ""negligible risk"" that ""these actions are only the result of the vendors advice, but not necessarily needed."" and then that the cause of the problem was extremely minor and not cause for concern. He flatly lied, in fact he included fake results he made up in the email. I'm serious, he actually wrote ""the system has experienced very small amounts of errors (&lt;25)"" which completely ignores the fact in reality there were 67 current errors and that they were progressing in *exponential* fashion. The drives had moved from critical to failing *in less than a few hours that same day.* Here he was emailing management, when he isn't even leading the response. I was furious, I felt management was being mislead for no reason, why would we tell them it's all OK when it's not? Regardless, I left and got the drives. The rebuild didn't happen that night though as I couldn't get authorization when boss lost reception before I could get back. The drive gave me time to cool down. That brings us to yesterday. I get in a few minutes past the usual time and the DBA immediately finds me and begins to badger me about the rebuild. &gt;""Why haven't you started the rebuild?"" He has full access to our team slack, he knows full well. Regardless, I inform him I never received authorization. &gt;""Well, why not just start it now?"" He's fully aware of the risks. Regardless, I inform him that the stress of the rebuild could crash our system before at least 1 more business day is finished and we don't know how much it will slow down everything else. &gt;""What risks? You keep saying that, but what risks are you talking about? Where does it say anywhere that the system could crash during a rebuild or that it could slow down?"" I tried to explain to him exactly what I had yesterday but he waved me away and walked off. I'm not going to lie, it was really difficult to keep my cool at this point. Hours later, I did the rebuild. It was a scary but greatly educational process. It went smoothly. I wrote a detailed report (purely professional, no mention of the arguments / issues that took place.) explaining everything that had happened to the systems and sent it off to my boss and the CTO. But then much to my dismay my boss began congratulating the both of us. I was shocked, considering the DBA had done nothing but mislead, drag his feet and criticize me again. It felt incredibly aggravating to see credit for my hard work thrown to him. My report, with logs, screenshots and everything attached quite literally contradicted nearly half of what the DBA had written. I made sure never to even come close to mentioning this, I figured folks could draw their own conclusions from this but it just seems shocking. ----------------------- And so that's it. Twice now we've faced critical situations and the DBA, who is involved for whatever reason, is incredibly negligent in response, incredibly unprofessional and downright rude. I just am at a complete and total loss for how to handle this. I suppose I could keep watching him crash and burn and maybe it finally blows up on him, but I can't help but feel mocked in the meantime. I really need guidance in how to handle this, I'm sick of him mocking me in front of everyone and nothing be done here."

Top developers of MySQL called it a day and began creating a fork of MySQL. This fork later came to be known as MariaDB and was officially made available to the Opensource community in 2009 under the GNU license. Since then, MariaDB continues to grow as more and more companies continue to migrate to MariaDB. With declining popularity of MySQL database and a massive shift to MariaDB, you may wonder what made MariaDB such a huge success since its inception. In this section, we will focus on some of the key improvements and features that have propelled MariaDBs growth and consequent popularity. To start off, MariaDB does not require a license especially when it comes to production / commercial environments. Since its takeover by Oracle, MySQL now requires a license for commercial purposes. This move compelled thousands of developers to opt for MariaDB. XAMPP, a popular web server stack even ditched MySQL for MariaDB in its LAMP stack. With no license being required for its deployment, MariaDB is thus considered a true opensource RDBMS - Relational Database Management System. MariaDB comes with an inbuilt and powerful clustering feature known as Galera Cluster with the ability to offer master-to-master and master-to-slave replication. It provides automatic node joining, row-level parallel replication, and synchronous replication with read &amp; write capability to any of the nodes in a cluster. Additionally, you can afford to lose a node(s) in your cluster without having to worry about interruptions in cluster operations and without deploying complex failover plans. MariaDB also comes with inbuilt robust storage engines and useful plugins. Cassandra storage engine provides support for NoSQL which accommodates both SQL and NoSQL systems. Theres TokuDB which facilitates processing of big data and is ideal for high performance and resource intensive environments. Other cutting-edge storage engines include Aria and XtraDB which have replaced the old and tired MyISAM and InnoDB respectively in MySQL. Other new and super cool features that come inbuilt in MariaDB include ColumnStore engine which is tailored specifically for data warehousing, CONNECT storage engine built for facilitating access to local and remote data by MariaDB, MyRocks which is an LSM database that provides a superb compression ratio, SEQUENCE engine for creation of sequences (whether ascending or descending from a given point of reference or starting value) and Spider engine to mention a few. MariaDB boasts better performance not only in query optimization but also in other functionalities as well. There are fast speeds when clients connect to MariaDB with more improvements added from MariaDB 10.1 &amp; 10.2 alike. This makes MariaDB a more preferred choice to MySQL. With the ever-increasing cases of cyber threats and vulnerabilities, MariaDB developers make regular security announcements and avail patches and upgrades. Also, their release notes contain all the latest CVE identifiers. This is a far cry from MySQL whose security announcements are less frequent and have been termed as vague, making patch management a difficult task to implement. Moreover, a huge disparity exists between the CVE identifiers listed in release notes and those currently in existence. Its important to also mention that there is better testing for MariaDB which contributes to fewer bugs in compilation warnings and errors. This has mainly been due to the large community of contributors, and developers whose sole aim is to improve the database system. All the source code is released under the General Public License (GPL) and all closed source modules found in MySQL are present in opensource MariaDB. This makes MariaDB a true Opensource Database System. Finally, MariaDB is a drop-in replacement for MySQL and migrating to MariaDB from MySQL is a matter of executing a few commands. If you have a few MySQL database instances running, all that is required is to remove/purge MySQL packages and install MariaDB. Settings will automatically be migrated making it a smooth and cool upgrade! Conclusion MariaDBs growth will remain undeterred largely due to its vibrant and opensource community that fosters maintenance of a better and cleaner code. The database System is also replete with a ton of useful features promising immersive experiences. In the next few years, we are likely to witness more companies making the shift to MariaDB as applications get more complex requiring more robust , stable and secure database systems."

This vulnerability is actively being exploited and allows an attacker to run code, as the current user, on a system that connects to a malicious web site. Microsoft has classified the vulnerability as Critical on workstation operating systems and Moderate on servers. **Bold**Workarounds Microsoft has reported a workaround that involves removing privileges from the jscript.dll file for the Everyone group. This is not expected to negatively impact functionality as IE uses a different file by default. This may be a good step for anyone that deems the risk of this vulnerability to be high, but are not able to patch systems. See the first referenced article for more details. **Bold**Recommendation Since this vulnerability is being actively exploited, CCL recommends testing and pushing out the patch to user workstations through your emergency out-of-band patching processes, as soon as possible. For servers, we recommend that you assess the risk this vulnerability poses to your environment, considering any existing controls to mitigate the risk of a web-based exploit on servers.

They were like, okay lets work with what we know. People don't update what they can't see or forget about. What if every custom application that uses custom libraries sat in they're own vm container. Companies usually contract for coding, and that coding usually revolves around an existing code/application/library/code platform and tend to tie it to specific attributes of usage of that specific version. Making it hard to upgrade underlying software. Most of the time when the code is written the contract doesn't include updates due to security issues or monitoring. They expect the company to keep a inventory of underlying requirements by their own security staff. Which a lot of companies say they do, but don't. So the company ends up with customize containers that don't conformer to some basic template that can be automatically updated or monitored. Because most do everything on cost, and time. So before long a company may have upwards of 100 containers with out-of-date underlying/supporting software un-patched and vulnerable to numerous known exploits. That are never updated and forgotten about. Most likely completely un-watched other than the dream that their packet inspection appliance will catch everything. By George I think we have something here. Lets call it something blatant like the Hacker Dick Docker..... Nah lets just call it Docker so we can laugh when everyone says it. Now you may be thinking sure! There's AWS with docker and security applications to watch and monitor suspicious activity and scanning! This is garbage! You don't know what your talking about you idiot!!! #@@#$# 1. Most companies are not going to have a docker/AWS specialist on staff. Don't forgot local Docker on Windows 2016.... yeah that exist. Local Cloud Weeeee! Sigh.... 2. People do whatever is the fastest and the cheapest. 3. Contract programmers work by the hour, and close a ticket. 4. If you said you want your new application in a docker container because you love buzz words that's exactly what youre going to get and nothing else. 5. Most companies that manufacture products or customer software will have custom built containers that do not conform to standards laid out by hosting providers. Lovely scanner and suspicious activity monitoring is great.... If it knows what it's actually looking at..... 6. How many companies really keep an inventory of all software used in a container? Then have someone that constantly runs a CVE checks against all of it? 7. How many things are going to break when you do update, how much is it going to cost to fix? Is someone going to pay, add it to project planning, or will it just be put off.... Yeah that's right put off. Until oops.... So in the end after converting your applications in to a new buzz word what do you have.... Docker. A massive attack vector surface area for most of the companies out there.

I'm a developer who works for a digital agency, we have a couple of developers and we are not really at the size where we can afford or justify a dedicated sysadmin, so at the minute we rely on our hosting provider for everything. Our existing level of service has been shocking, a couple of quick examples are.. * When asked to install an SSL certificate on one site, they took down all of our staging sites. * Stated that our server was not vulnerable to CVE-2016-5195. I had to demonstrate, using a PoC, that it was easy to get root privelages! * When I asked for an IP to be whitelisted, the server firewall was simply disabled. * Their monitoring service has failed to notice that websites have been down overnight. * Their back up service was down for a couple of months without us having any idea! * When we transferred our existing SSLs over to them, they didn't notify us when they expired. These are just the tip of the iceberg. This is ongoing and we often end up being humiliated in front of clients due to their mistakes We all have basic skills - enough to get a staging environment up and do the odd few tasks - but we lack the skills for a production environment, especially if something is happening that requires a quick resolution or indepth knowledge of Linux, and also we don't work out of hours which means that we need someone we can trust when we are not in the office. Our requirements mean that PaaS hosting doesn't quite fit - for example we would ideally like to recompile nginx with the pagespeed module - which is something that even Rackspace won't support under their managed hosting! Ideally we would like to work with someone who understands Ansible, as we use this internally with Vagrant and ideally would like to integrate this into our hosting instead of just our local development environments. We've also had to recompile to support HTTP2 as our existing hosts were running an old version of OpenSSL (the details there might be inaccurate but it was something along those lines). Are there hosting companies out there with really good sysadmins, who can do these kinds of tasks for us? Alternatively, are there any other solutions you would recommend - 3rd party managed AWS? sysadmins on a retainer? Budgets are an important consideration, but I realise that you do have to spend to get quality. What is the most cost effective solution across multiple clients? We have a number of clients, none of them are on particularly powerful hosting - generally they are on virtual machines with up to 16GB ram, and up to 8 cores, so I'm sure that will be a factor in the type of setup that we can get for this.

According to information exclusively available to c't, researchers have already found eight new security holes in Intel processors. The vulnerabilities known as Spectre and Meltdown shook the IT world to its foundations: researchers proved that there is a fundamental design flaw in all modern processors with serious repercussions for system security (see c't issue 3/2018). After several patches were released, it seemed everything would be fine after all, although some experts warned that more revelations could follow. But the hope remained that the manufacturers could solve the problem with a few security updates. As it turns out, we can bury that hope. A total of eight new security flaws in Intel CPUs have already been reported to the manufacturer by several teams of researchers. For now, details on the flaws are being kept secret. All eight are essentially caused by the same design problem  you could say that they are Spectre Next Generation. c't has exclusive information on Spectre-NG, which we have been able to verify in several ways  we double and triple checked all the facts. Nonetheless, we will not publish technical details as long as there is still a chance that manufacturers will get their security updates ready before the details of the flaws become public. However, we will use our information to report about future releases of patches and provide background information. Eight new security flaws Each of the eight vulnerabilities has its own number in the Common Vulnerability Enumerator (CVE) directory and each requires its own patches. It is likely that each vulnerability will receive its own name. Until then, we will jointly call these flaws Spectre-NG in order to distinguish them from the previously uncovered issues. So far we only have concrete information on Intel's processors and their plans for patches. However, there is initial evidence that at least some ARM CPUs are also vulnerable. Further research is already underway on whether the closely related AMD processor architecture is also susceptible to the individual Spectre-NG gaps, and to what extent. Intel is already working on its own patches for Spectre-NG and developing others in cooperation with the operating system manufacturers. According to our information, Intel is planning two waves of patches. The first is scheduled to start in May; a second is currently planned for August. Knowing that Google Project Zero discovered one of the Spectre-NG flaws gives us an idea of when to expect the first patch. Googles elite hackers are scrupulous about observing the 90 day deadline that is meant to give companies time to address flaws after they have been notified  but they have no qualms about going public when the deadline ends, even if a patch has yet to be released. Time will run out on May 7  the day before the next Windows patch day. Intel itself expects that information about a second flaw could be published any day now. Therefore, we can expect to see patches for these two vulnerabilities sooner rather than later. There are signs that Microsoft is also preparing for CPU patches. Originally the Redmond based company expected the problems would be solved through microcode updates. Now it seems the fixes (or mitigations) will be distributed as (optional) Windows updates. PC manufacturers are simply taking too long to provide BIOS updates. Microsoft is also offering up to $250,000 in a bug bounty program for Spectre flaws. Linux kernel developers are continuously working on hardening measures against Spectre attacks as well. More dangerous than Spectre Intel itself classifies four of the Spectre-NG vulnerabilities as ""high risk""; the remaining four are rated as ""medium"". According to our own research, risks and attack scenarios at Spectre-NG are similar to those at Spectre  with one exception. One of the Spectre-NG flaws simplifies attacks across system boundaries to such an extent that we estimate the threat potential to be significantly higher than with Spectre. Specifically, an attacker could launch exploit code in a virtual machine (VM) and attack the host system from there  the server of a cloud hoster, for example. Alternatively, it could attack the VMs of other customers running on the same server. Passwords and secret keys for secure data transmission are highly sought-after targets on cloud systems and are acutely endangered by this gap. Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX), which are designed to protect sensitive data on cloud servers, are also not Spectre-safe. Although attacks on other VMs or the host system were already possible in principle with Spectre, the real-world implementation required so much prior knowledge that it was extremely difficult. However, the aforementioned Spectre-NG vulnerability can be exploited quite easily for attacks across system boundaries, elevating the threat potential to a new level. Cloud service providers such as Amazon or Cloudflare and, of course, their customers are particularly affected. Still, the concrete danger for private individuals and corporate PCs is rather small, because there are usually other weak points which are easier to exploit. Nevertheless, they should be taken seriously and the upcoming Spectre-NG updates should be installed quickly after their release. However, if the past is any indication, things won't go so smoothly in practcice. Even when the Spectre updates were made available, there were several glitches, despite a lead time of more than six months. In addition, some patches reduce performance and some companies refuse BIOS updates for computers that are only a few years old. All this will get worse rather than better with Spectre NG. A fundamental security problem Overall, the Spectre-NG gaps show that Spectre and Meltdown were not a one-off slip-up. It is not just a simple gap that could be plugged with a few patches. Rather, it seems that for each fixed issue, two others crop up. This is the result of the fact that during the past twenty years, safety considerations have only played second fiddle to performance in processor development. An end to patches for hardware problems of the Spectre category is not in sight. But a never-ending flood of patches is not an acceptable solution. You can't shrug off the fact that the core component of our entire IT infrastructure has a fundamental security problem that will keep leading to more problems. Of course, Intel needs to fix the current weaknesses as quickly as possible  and that's what is happening. At the same time, however, the CPU design needs to be fundamentally rethought. Werner Haas of the German company Cyberus Technology and one of the co-discoverers of Spectre/Meltdown, considers it quite possible to equip high-performance processors with a solid security design. However, this would require security aspects to be taken into account in the architecture right from the start. Paul Kocher, who was also involved in unveiling Spectre, suggested implementing additional, specially secured CPU cores. And with methods such as threat modeling, risky techniques can be implemented in such a way that security remains controllable. Intel made the promise of ""security first"" at the beginning of January. Now the company must provide more transparency and, for example, publish risk analyses of potential weak points. So far, Intel has been acting more along the lines of ""We are the experts, we're doing it right"", relying on technologies such as the Intel Management Engine and the Software Guard Extensions. We should no longer be fobbed off with vague promises when it comes to central components of our IT infrastructure. URL"

Second of two posts today. This one is very important to understand as it could potentially impact the way that you access (or can't access) your systems via RDP. Yes yes, I know, you should use PowerShell or Windows Admin Center to manage your machines, but we know that you still like good ole RDP.. Without further ado! Article Link: URL &gt; # CredSSP, RDP and Raven &gt; Welcome to another addition of AskPFEPlat, this is Paul Bergson and [Graeme Bray](URL bringing up the topic of CredSSP when in use with the Remote Desktop Protocol. This topic became an internal discussion around Premier Field Engineering and customers like you as to how this would impact accessing systems via RDP starting in May. This discussion kind of aligns itself with an experience I recently had with my Miniature Schnauzer, Raven. You might be asking yourself what could Raven possibly have to do with IT maintenance? &gt; Being a Premier Field Engineer I end up traveling and my backpack is my carryon of choice when I board a plane, so I always carry some snacks in the event I get hungry. A couple of months back I returned from a trip presenting Protecting Against Ransomware to a customer and upon my return I left a half-eaten bag of candy in the side pocket of my backpack. This was just a regular size bag, but sugar isnt good for dogs. I kept telling myself, I should remove the bag, but I wanted to ensure I had something in the event of a candy emergency. So, my urge for sweets beat my common sense that Raven would ever find the half-eaten bag in my backpack. &gt; So, I get home late with my wife, a couple of nights ago and Raven races to the door to greet us, but she quickly decides to race around the house just to run. All I could think was what got into her??? As I entered the living room (she went zooming by) I see the candy wrapper from my backpack strewn all over the carpet. All I could do was think, that I knew better and wasnt happy with myself. &gt; Raven didnt get sick, but it was a lesson to me to follow my instincts and not put Raven in this situation. This could have easily been prevented but I just convinced myself, Dont worry, things will be fine when in fact I was aware of the risk and ignored it anyways! &gt; So, with that in mind, I wanted to call to your attention a Microsoft, May 2018 tentative update that could impact the ability to establish remote host RDP session connections within an organization. This issue can occur if the local client and the remote host have differing Encryption Oracle Remediation settings within the registry that define how to build an RDP session with CredSSP. The Encryption Oracle Remediation setting options are defined below and if the server or client have different expectations on the establishment of a secure RDP session the connection could be blocked. There is the possibility that the current default setting could change from the tentative update and therefore impact the expected secure session requirement. &gt; With the release of the March 2018 Security bulletin, there was a fix that specifically addressed a CredSSP, Remote Code Execution vulnerability (CVE-2018-0886) which could impact RDP connections. &gt; An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could relay user credentials and use them to execute code on the target system. &gt; URL &gt; Besides both the client and server being patched, there is the requirement that a new Group Policy setting be applied to define the protection for the CredSSP configuration, currently the setting will default to Vulnerable. The recommendation is to define a group policy to set it to either Force updated clients or Mitigated on both client and server. &gt; If you review the options of the group policy settings, you will see that there are 3 states in which the registry setting can exist on the clients and servers. Engineers will also want to consider devices in an unpatched state as seen in the table at the end of this document. &gt; Note: Ensure that you update the Group Policy Central Store (Or if not using a Central Store, use a device with the patch applied when editing Group Policy) with the latest CredSSP.admx and CredSSP.adml. These files will contain the latest copy of the edit configuration settings for these settings, as seen below. &gt; URL &gt; ##Group Policy &gt; [Go to the article to see this table](URL &gt; The Encryption Oracle Remediation Group Policy supports the following three options, which should be applied to clients and servers: &gt; [Go to the article to see this table too](URL &gt; A second update, **tentatively** scheduled to be released on May 8, 2018, will change the default behavior from ***Vulnerable*** to ***Mitigated***. &gt; Note: Any change to Encryption Oracle Remediation** requires a reboot**. &gt; URL &gt; From the policy description above and with the tentative update and default registry setting coming in May, it is best that you plan a policy to ensure there is no loss in connectivity to your servers from RDP connections. &gt; [To see the rest, please continue at the article link.](URL **Please, please, PLEASE take a few minutes to read and understand this article and the potential impact that you could see.

Today's post is one that I talk about often with all of my customers, just in a general Windows Server hygiene conversation. I strongly recommend that everyone take a gander at this article and see where you can start to implement some of these solutions, such as on your new Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 deployments. Article Link: URL Without Further Ado! &gt; # Retire Those Old Legacy Protocols &gt; Hello Paul Bergson back again, and I wanted to bring up another security topic. There has been a lot of work by enterprises to protect their infrastructure with patching and server hardening, but one area that is often overlooked when it comes to credential theft and that is legacy protocol retirement. These legacy protocols were built when there wasnt the understanding of security requirements that our modern enterprises need today. &gt; To better understand my point, American football is very fast and violent. Professional teams spend a lot of money on their quarterbacks. Quarterbacks are often the highest paid player on the team and the one who guides the offense. There are many legendary offensive linemen who have played the game and during their time of play they dominated the opposing defensive linemen. Over time though, these legends begin to get injured and slow down do to natural aging. Imagine a quarterback at the peak of his career, making over $10 million in salary being protected by a legendary offensive line that was 10 years beyond their prime. If you think of these older protocols like offensive linemen that are protecting the operating system and its data, they need patches (injured) and they get old &amp; slow (weak encryption, etc). Unfortunately, I see all too often, enterprises running old protocols that have been compromised, with in the wild exploits defined, to attack these weak protocols. No General Manager would ever risk the safety/security of his investment in his key offensive player(s), neither should the teams responsible in protecting the safety and security of their IT enterprise. &gt; Attack Surface Reduction can be achieved by disabling support for insecure legacy protocols. &gt; * TLS 1.0 &amp; 1.1 (As well as all versions of SSL) &gt; * Server Message Block v1 (SMBv1) &gt; * LanMan (LM) / NTLMv1 &gt; * Digest Authentication &gt; The SSL protocol is broken and can no longer be fixed, threats such as POODLE still exist (see cve-2014-3566) SSL protocol should be retired. TLS 1.0 is no longer considered secure and as of June 30, 2018 the PCI board has set for a deadline for disabling all SSL and TLS 1.0 with the recommendation to use TLS 1.2. ****1*** &gt; The WannaCrypt ransomware attack, worked to infect a first internal endpoint. The initial attack could have started from phishing, drive-by, etc Once a device was compromised, it used an SMB v1 vulnerability in a worm-like attack to laterally spread internally. ****2*** &gt; A second round of attacks occurred about 1 month later named Petya, it also worked to infect an internal endpoint. Once it had a compromised device, it expanded its capabilities by not only laterally moving via the SMB vulnerability it had automated credential theft and impersonation to expand on the number devices it could compromise. ****3*** ****4*** &gt; Both WannaCrypt and Petya are just two of many assaults that leverage SMBv1. With LanMan and NTLMv1 there are open source tools readily available to capture and crack credentials. This is why it is becoming so important for enterprises to retire old outdated equipment, even if it still works! &gt; The rest of this document covers details of the protocols and how they can be removed from the enterprises environment. &gt; Ned Pyle wrote a great blog on the retirement of SMB1 that I have borrowed from. This is a great article that you will want to read if you havent already. The link to his article can be found in the References below. &gt; ## Server Message Block v1 (SMBv1) &gt; With SMB1 you dont have access to modern security features that SMB 3 provides. ****5*** &gt; Updated security features are found below &gt; * Pre-authentication Integrity (SMB 3.1.1+) &gt; &gt; * Protects against security downgrade attacks &gt; * Secure Dialect Negotiation (SMB 3.0, 3.02) &gt; &gt; * Protects against security downgrade attacks &gt; * Encryption (SMB 3.0+). Prevents inspection of data on the wire, MiTM attacks &gt; &gt; * In SMB 3.1.1 encryption performance is even better than signing &gt; * Insecure guest auth blocking (SMB 3.0+ on Windows 10+) &gt; &gt; * Protects against MiTM attacks &gt; * Better message signing (SMB 2.02+) &gt; &gt; * HMAC SHA-256 replaces MD5 as the hashing algorithm in SMB 2.02, SMB 2.1 and AES-CMAC replaces that in SMB 3.0+ &gt; &gt; * Signing performance increases in SMB2 and 3 &gt; ## SMB1 is Very Inefficient When Compared to SMB 3.0 *5 &gt; * Larger reads and writes (2.02+) &gt; &gt; * More efficient use of faster networks or higher latency WANs &gt; &gt; * Large MTU support. &gt; * Peer caching of folder and file properties (2.02+) &gt; &gt; * Clients keep local copies of folders and files via BranchCache &gt; * Durable handles (2.02, 2.1) &gt; &gt; * Allow for connection to transparently reconnect to the server if there is a temporary disconnection &gt; * Client oplock leasing model (2.02+) &gt; &gt; * Limits the data transferred between the client and server, improving performance on high-latency networks and increasing SMB server scalability &gt; * Multichannel &amp; SMB Direct (3.0+) &gt; &gt; * Aggregation of network bandwidth and fault tolerance if multiple paths are available between client and server, plus usage of modern ultra-high throughout RDMA infrastructure &gt; * Directory Leasing (3.0+) &gt; &gt; *Improves application response times in branch offices through caching &gt; ## Use Cases Where SMB1 is Still Required &gt; * Still running XP or WS2003 (Or older) &gt; &gt; * Out of support (Unless there is a custom support agreement in place) &gt; * Old management software that demands admins browse the network neighborhood master browser list &gt; * Old network storage device &gt; * Old multi-function printers with old firmware in order to scan to share &gt; The above listed services should all be scheduled for retirement since they risk the security integrity of the enterprise.

I haven't been able to find much from google with regard to more details around the specifics of reading PDF's, just that generally malicious PDF's might be crafted more for Adobe Reader rather than Chrome. After failing my searches, I tried to compile the CVE releases and fixes implemented by both Adobe and Chrome, but Chrome has like double the amount of vulnerabilities -- but that doesn't necessarily translate into the PDF problems that adobe might face.

While programs are typically not permitted to read data from other programs, a malicious program can exploit Meltdown and Spectre to get hold of secrets stored in the memory of other running programs. This might include your passwords stored in a password manager or browser, your personal photos, emails, instant messages and even business-critical documents. URL Looks like this is the official information release of the CPU bugs discussed over the past few days. Academic papers and Q&amp;A are provided in the link. Official CVEs: * CVE-2017-5715 * CVE-2017-5753 * CVE-2017-5754 **Meltdown Abstract** &gt; The security of computer systems fundamentally relies on memory isolation, e.g., kernel address ranges are marked as non accessible and are protected from user access. In this paper, we present Meltdown. Meltdown exploits side effects of out of-order execution on modern processors to read arbitrary kernel-memory locations including personal data and passwords. Out-of-order execution is an indispensable performance feature and present in a wide range of modern processors. The attack is independent of the operating system, and it does not rely on any software vulnerabilities. Meltdown breaks all security assumptions given by address space isolation as well as paravirtualized environments and, thus, every security mechanism building upon this foundation. On affected systems, Meltdown enables an adversary to read memory of other processes or virtual machines in the cloud without any permissions or privileges, affecting millions of customers and virtually every user of a personal computer. We show that the KAISER defense mechanism for KASLR [8] has the important (but inadvertent) side effect of impeding Meltdown. We stress that KAISER must be deployed immediately to prevent large-scale exploitation of this severe information leakage. **Spectre Abstract** &gt; Modern processors use branch prediction and speculative execution to maximize performance. For example, if the destination of a branch depends on a memory value that is in the process of being read, CPUs will try guess the destination and attempt to execute ahead. When the memory value finally arrives, the CPU either discards or commits the speculative computation. Speculative logic is unfaithful in how it executes, can access to the victims memory and registers, and can perform operations with measurable side effects. &gt; Spectre attacks involve inducing a victim to speculatively perform operations that would not occur during correct program execution and which leak the victims confidential information via a side channel to the adversary. This paper describes practical attacks that combine methodology from side channel attacks, fault attacks, and return-oriented programming that can read arbitrary memory from the victims process. More broadly, the paper shows that speculative execution implementations violate the security assumptions underpinning numerous software security mechanisms, including operating system process separation, static analysis, containerization, just-in-time (JIT) compilation, and countermeasures to cache timing/side-channel attacks. These attacks represent a serious threat to actual systems, since vulnerable speculative execution capabilities are found in microprocessors from Intel, AMD, and ARM that are used in billions of devices. &gt; While makeshift processor-specific countermeasures are possible in some cases, sound solutions will require fixes to processor designs as well as updates to instruction set architectures (ISAs) to give hardware architects and software developers a common understanding as to what computation state CPU implementations are (and are not) permitted to leak."

For more information, please refer to this article posted on Intels website. URL Rest assured we are working diligently with Intel and others in the industry to address the issue. We highly recommend you bookmark the following pages where we will be publishing the latest information on affected Dell / Dell EMC products including BIOS updates as they are available. Dell Client URL Dell Enterprise (Dell Servers, Storage and Networking) URL RSA (customer login required) URL Dell EMC Storage &amp; Data Protection (customer login required) URL Dell EMC CPSD (customer login required) URL In addition, Dell recommends customers follow security best practices for malware protection to protect against possible exploitation of these analysis methods. These practices include promptly adopting software updates, avoiding unrecognized hyperlinks and websites, and following secure password protocols. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we work to mitigate this vulnerability. Common FAQs Is my 12G System also impacted? - Yes, 10+ passed years systems are impacted. - For 14G and 13G Dell has already received the microcode fix from Intel and has released the proper BIOS versions to fix the issues. - 12G microcode should be provided next week by Intel, so Dell release will be by next week or two. - 11G microcode should be provided at the end of the month by Intel, so Dell release should be early February. What about older generations? - There is no plan at the moment for previous generations (10G/9G). Support EOL is well passed at this stage. - In addition from an OS perspective platforms like 9G supports only OS versions that are also EOL, and OS vendors have no plan at this stage to release fixes on these versions. Why Dell website is talking of enhancement and not fix? - Ex : URL - Enhancement to address CVE-2017-5715 (URL details to be published January 2018. - Updated the Intel Xeon Processor E5-2600 v4 Product Family Processor Microcode to version 0x0b000025. - Updated the Xeon Processor E5-2600 v3 Product Family Processor Microcode to version 0x3B. - NOTE: The wording is currently being worked to get it more explicit. However, the BIOS update is not a fix by itself as the Software layer is also involved in the resolution of the issue. BIOS is fixing the Hardware layer of the issue. OS patches will have to be applied to fix the Software layer of the issue. Why only CVE-2017-5715 is listed into the new BIOS release? - The BIOS release is the only one scheduled for the 3 CVE fixes (CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715 - Spectre, CVE-2017-5754 -Meltdown). What is the performance impact? - From a BIOS perspective there is no measurable impact. - From an OS perspective, it may vary a lot depending of factors like OS type, workload and the portions of the overall fix you enable (OS specific). - As a general statement there might be some performance impact at software level anyway as there is mechanisms being implemented which should add some latency on some workloads Dell EMC continues to investigate this issue to identify any potential impact to products and will continue to update the above Knowledge Base Articles with information as it becomes available, including impacted products and remediation steps.

291,CVE-,sysadmin,Get details for multiple CVE Identifiers at once?,0,7cz9cp,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7cz9cp/get_details_for_multiple_cve_identifiers_at_once/,2017-11-15 09:10:06,Some vendors put just CVE identifiers in their release notes with no other details. With 20+ CVE ids in the notes for a single release looking each up individually to get the details and impact score is a big hassle. Ideally I could just pull the details and impact scores for all the list of CVE ids at once and either display them on a single website or just dump them into a single document for review. Does anyone have a site or other advice on how to pull details for multiple CVEs based on a list of CVE ids?

I am in need of some explanation for a few things. To start, the business is a help desk for local small business and residents. We take credit cards through a small card reader connected to the ethernet and do not store any card info locally. We have two locations that are connected via a site to site Cisco VPN (RV042G) and I believe it may be causing some of the failures. Listed below are all of the failure points reported by Trustwave: Block cipher algorithms with block size of 64 bits (like DES and 3DES) birthday attack known as Sweet32, CVE-20162183 SSL Certificate Public Key Too Small SSLv3 Supported TLSv1.0 Supported SSL version 3 protocol padding oracle attack (POODLE), CVE2014-3566 SSL/TLS Weak Encryption Algorithms, CVE-2013-2566 CVE-2015-2808 I have been doing research for days on what these are and how to fix them but have gotten nowhere. Our two stores are being charged monthly for these failures and I have been tasked with the job of becoming compliant. I have seen the suggestion for adding another phone line for the credit reader but that would increase our monthly cost, which is not an option. It was suggested to use the provided fixes from Trustwave but I could not find anything that resembled a fix for any of the vulnerabilities. I have read many fixes on forums for some of these vulnerabilities but nowhere do they specify where I am actually making these fixes. I have 3 Windows workstations at my office and there are about 6 workstations and 2 servers at our other location. In my office, I have an ISP provided modem converting the cable to an off the shelf wi-fi AP. I can update this post with the networking hardware for our other location as it has been over a year since I have been there. Our server is used or Quickbooks and OSticket but we ran a scan with them turned off and we still failed. (The listed failures are strictly for my office and not the second location.) My first plan has been to set up two PFSense firewalls containing our out of data VPN in a form of a DMZ so that the external scan would not see the issues. But learning the software has been a bit of a hurtle. I'm sure with time I will get the hang of it but for now, I just wanted to make sure I am not wasting my time. As far as Windows vulnerabilities I always make sure all workstations are all updated, and I am always up to date on infosec twitter to make sure none of our customers/office has any open 0days. I considered myself pretty technical but these vulnerabilities have been kicking my ass so any input would be greatly appreciated. If anybody needs any more information let me know. Thanks again."

For disclosure purposes, I'd like to intentionally keep this as vague as possible while expressing just how serious this is. OK so earlier today, one of my client's web application servers ground to a complete halt. Upon investigating, I stumbled upon something pretty serious: A *very commonly* used web server goes totally poo-flinging apeshit and basically somersaults, fork bombs and then segfaults itself 60 feet into the ground when it receives a packet crafted in a relatively generic but unexpected way. From a single packet. Checking CVE and changelogs, there's no mention of this glitch. Additionally, the web app server is running the most recent version. I'm pretty sure this is a 0day. Fortunately, this client is *extremely* proactive and diligent when it comes to infosec, and as such, I have very verbose access and error logs shoved right into an elasticsearch cluster. Additionally, I was incredibly lucky in that this somehow matched some random obscure Snort IDS rule, and it actually logged the entire offending packet! Actually, I was able to log several packets, each with basically the same payload, and the same result. The first thing I did was set up a rule to block traffic that matched this pattern. Maybe a bit dumb, as in retrospect, I could have probably played with this a bit :) They tried this once more time, and naturally, Snort blocked the offender. They never tried again. Fortunately, no information was actually leaked through this process. The web application server sits behind CloudFront, and the requests were made directly. The server is also configured to send back [our version of this](URL if the Host: header is invalid or empty, so I'm pretty certain these guys don't even know who runs this server. OK, so what are the next steps? The software is open source, so I'd like to submit this information in as confidential a way as possible. I actually don't work much with open source communities, so I'm completely at a loss as to how to submit this report without 40 other contributors seeing the same thing. Reddit, wat do?"

Also when I try to wget the latest version, and do the make/make install it doesn't update even after a reboot. Next, I went into nginx and apache (somehow the server utilizes both) and made sure that the deprecated ciphers aren't being used. I figured I was good at this point... They just re-tested the site using TrustWave, and Sweet32 is still coming back as a FAIL status. I'm kind of unsure of where I should go from here... do any of you have any ideas or information that may point me in the right direction?

A lot of spam was sent from his email account and the hosting company said he likely got hacked because he's using an outdated CMS. I'm trying to help him migrate to an updated version of the CMS and get rid of malware, if there is any. But first I need to understand what's going on. How is it possible for the hacker to send spam after hacking the main website? The SMTP server is separate from the main server (smtp.hostingprovider.com), and presumably requires my friend's username and password to the smtp server (basically his Microsoft Outlook login), right? In theory, it should be separate from any passwords used on the website, correct? So the attacker shouldn't have been able to send mail via the SMTP server...? My current best guess is that maybe there was a file on the website that had the SMTP login in it. I remember there was an emailing app on the website once, so maybe the app had the login, so that it could connect to the SMTP server. If that's true, then I should be able to simply ask the hosting provider to change the login of the SMTP and maybe the attacker won't be able to send spam anymore, while I fix the vulnerabilities. Am I correct, or is it not that simple? Edit: It's probably not that simple, is it? He runs a small website making business, and not only his website is compromised, but also his clients' websites are compromised (or at least, they have also been sending spam). I'd like to know how you think the attacker did this. My only guess right now is that maybe there was a list of logins on the main site for every one of his clients. But I don't really know. *** Also, what's the best way of making sure there aren't any shells on the webserver after I upgrade it? I couldn't find any malicious files, but there might still be malicious code somewhere (although, I guess the hacker doesn't really need a shell on the website. He could have just connected directly to the SMTP server through his own computer, right?). For example, [this exploit](URL would have left the exploit code inside the Joomla database, if I've understood correctly. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

331,CVE-,sysadmin,Check your linux boxes folks,184,4x8lt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/4x8lt5/check_your_linux_boxes_folks/,2016-08-12 01:37:57,"EDIT: CVE-2016-5696 OVERVIEW: A recently discovered Linux security flaw lets hackers remotely inject malware into downloads, HTTP connections, launch denial-of-service attacks, and more. The flaw, present in the open-source kernel since version 3.6 and higher, can be exploited by an attacker to confirm whether any two systems are talking to each other over a network. Furthermore, it can be abused to break connections or insert malicious code and data into their communications if the exchange is not properly encrypted. In other words, you can hijack HTTP with this. You do not need to be a man-in-the-middle attacker to pull this off; you do not need to be eavesdropping on a network. You can be off to the side, firing the right packets at both ends to compromise their exchanges. You have to know the IP addresses of both sides of the connection, and you have to be able to send spoofed packets to them. And that's about it. The security weakness was discovered by researchers at the University of California, Riverside. It's buried within the Linux implementation of RFC 5961, which was published in 2010 and has been supported in the kernel since 2012. This standard was supposed to make internet communications more secure  but quite the opposite has happened. More information about the flaw can be found here: URL A demonstration of the attack can be found here: URL RISK LEVEL: HIGH SYSTEMS AFFECTED: Networked systems running Linux kernel 3.6 or higher. MITIGATION OPTIONS: As a workaround while patches to fix the problem are prepared and distributed, you can raise the rate limit on your Linux machine or gadget to make it more difficult for an attacker to be successful, by appending the following to the /etc/sysctl.conf file on a system running Linux (Kernel v3.6+): NOTE: You need to be root to do this. net.ipv4.tcp_challenge_ack_limit = 999999999 Execute sysctl -p to activate the new rule.

A Windows Update KB for each of the MS16s referenced can be found in one of the monthly Windows 10 cumulative updates (CU). Microsoft states that each monthly CU includes the fixes from each previous CU. When a CU is applied, it appears in Windows Update under its own KB heading, and does not list the various patches rolled into it. After several months of applying the most recent CUs, the vulnerabilities still appear in LanGuard. Example: One vulnerability refers to MS16-047. The fix for this vulnerability is Windows Update KB 3148527. For Windows 10 version 1511, this was included in the April 2016 CU (KB 3147458). The computer in question has the CU from July 2016 (KB 3172985). In theory, this vulnerability should be patched. Yet the vulnerability appears when the computer is scanned. This example is one of around 20 that follow a similar pattern. My question is twofold: 1) When scanning for these vulnerabilities, is LanGuard simply checking for the presence of a vulnerability-specific KB, or is it actually looking into the code for whatever setting/entry needs to be changed? 2) If it's only looking for a vulnerability-specific KB, and is not looking for the CUs, is there a way to verify that the vulnerability has been taken care of? None of the KBs for these vulnerabilities have a registry key for verification."

He is a webhosting + email reseller, currently using GoDaddy. He's being using a single CentOS 6 VPS with cPanel &amp; WHMCS and keeps getting pwn3d in various ways. I haven't had the time to investigate how the breaches have been happening, and it may be hard at this time considering how the hackers seem to keep getting in through backdoors they've left themselves and the machine is clearly rooted considering the kernel running on it was compiled in 2014 among much more evidence. I do know that one of the more recent hacks was due to someone exploiting a WHMCS vulnerability he took two days to install the patch for. Why this wasn't auto-updated like the rest of the software on his server--I can't say. What I can say from briefly looking through WHMCS source code is that it looks like shit. They're making direct calls to the shell in many places to perform tasks they should be using the PHP libraries to write functions for. Haven't looked at cPanel really, but seems to have a lengthy CVE track record. Anyway, while I would never run these myself, my dad does need GUI management/ billing software because he doesn't know how to use a shell. So one of the other problems with the setup of his server is that he gives his customers FTP (I haven't confirmed it's SFTP only, but I hope so) to their own home directories, so they can manage their sites. I'm not sure whether he's using fail2ban or some type of throttling or IP blacklisting techniques. Keys would be a better alternative to passwords as well. It does seem like Wordpress is being kept up to date and I'm not sure whether or not customers can run their own Wordpress plugins. It's my intention to make sure these things I just mentioned get taken care of because they will prevent a break-in in the first place. Still though, he needs to have some defenses in place to ensure a break in to a non-privileged account doesn't lead to a root. That's where I really need suggestions.

Started my own local MSP for residents and small businesses to teach myself about issues common (or uncommon, or downright terrifying) in an IT-related field. Wound up working for a professional, larger-grade MSP, then on-contract for one of the larger school districts in the state, then Texas DOT (oh my god - never again), then Hewlett-Packard, and finally, where I am today. Today, while primarily Windows-based, I don't have a problem with learning something new, or gradually tackling a larger task that requires a skillset that I'm not-yet a veteran of. **How it all started** It all started with SSL certs. You know those tricksy little devils. Generate the CSR, buy your cert, plug in the info, spit out the key, throw it where you need it from a cert repository. We have a slew of websites - both internal and externally facing (internal we use self-signed from a root CA we've got; external we use a vendor) - that utilize them on both Linux and Windows-based platforms. Since the infrastructure team is sort of small and the workload of our senior guys is pretty heavy, I get tasked with a ticket to help one of our other departments install a new SSL cert on a server they're spinning up in Rackspace using CentOS. Then, a few weeks later, another. Then a few days later, two or three more certs. Then to help trouble-shoot logging issues. It goes on and on until I realize the entire reason why this was all suddenly falling in my lap was that there was this backlog of work these external, Linux-based systems required, and the company (about 3-4k people) did not in fact have a Linux admin. Even upon this realization, I do what I can with what research hours I can spare in helping shore up some issues, and finally get comfortable enough after dicking around with a test-bed to finally act on issues that the security guy has been blasting email about every month : SSL and cipher suite vulnerabilities. We have a staggering amount of servers that are still utilizing weak Diffie-Hellman suites, RC4, MD5...vulnerable to CRIME/BREACH/BREAK/POODLE, pretty sure theres a few that are probably vulnerable to HEARTBLEED. This, obviously, scares the shit out of him, and by proxy, me, since this is now suddenly my baby. Skip ahead to this week. Infosec, after about a month of investigation of employees (internal) and clients (external) getting Cryptowall/locker, puts it down to a 99% probability that the company website is the culprit handing out malware. Further investigations show that, utilizing our weaknesses against a variety of webforms and cipher suites, whoever did this planted a backdoor in the root directory that was actively handing out the files necessary to kick off our Crypto-ware outbreak.

To make this work, the internal caches must not be vulnerable and must also not return UDP responses &gt; 512 bytes. I'm already running djb's dnscache internally and I know that dnscache doesn't use glibc for name resolution. I'm less sure about the response size limitation. From the dnscache docs: When the answer section is truncated by UDP length limits, it is eliminated entirely. Per the RFC, the DNS packets are limited to 512 bytes but UDP is theoretically limited to 65,536 bytes. Can anybody confirm whether this is true for dnscache?"

Heres a pastebin since it doesnt seem to paste well on reddit URL After searching for a file, I figured out that this is a result of some new proftpd bug or exploit, CVE-2015-3306 -- URL All in all, it looks like the attacker didn't get far and gave up It looks like proftpd fixed it, URL , but my issue is that Ubuntu has not fixed it.. URL and URL I do understand that proftpd apparently comes from the ""universe"" repository on ubuntu.. which is community maintained but the thing is, years ago I used to download and manually compile everything, which became so so tedious and such a hassle.. that when I discovered that I could just start installing packages from the OS distribution, i.e using apt-get, I started using debian, then later moved on to Ubuntu I'd really like to not go back to my previous life of downloading and compiling each and every package I have on my combination of dozens of virtual machines/physical servers.. but i still want to be secure too.. Sure, i could have and should have set up firewall rules on port 21 so that only certain IPs or ranges can ftp in, but still.. I run ubuntu on all my servers/vms.. because of all the things i listed above, w/ the whole ease of doing things. Sure, I could just run debian instead but i fear this same kinda thing would happen again I also can't just say screw the universe repository and other community maintained ones since wouldn't that limit me severely on what packages I can install? I wouldn't be able to install proftpd or other things that are useful to me What would you do if you were me, but still wanted to keep the ease of things going? Am I asking too much? 1. Should I switch to a new OS? If so what? I wonder what version of proftpd arch linux supplies **2. Just use a different ftp server and keep using ubuntu?** 3. Should I go and start using Debian instead? Since they apparently fixed it.. yet ubuntu has not 4. Is there another secure OS that still has a lot of stuff? I typically need apache, mysql, openssh, and sometimes proftpd, but also php etc. I've gotten really used to setting up boxes/vms with say apt-get install apache2 , php5, mysql, etc Then being able to enable php mods, with php5enmod (modname) I really like the structure of things like /etc/php5/mods-available /etc/apache2/conf-available /etc/apache2/mods-available /etc/apache2/mods-enabled /etc/apache2/sites-available /etc/apache2/sites-enabled a2ensite a2dissite Then i also need libapache2-mod-suphp I've just really gotten used to the way the way things are. The more I write this post, the more I feel like I just should maybe.. stick with ubuntu, start I guess just being more aware of security holes for things I specifically run So maybe just ill just sign up for mailing list for proftpd ? and then anything else I run, and then keep running ubuntu? Or is there another OS that I could run that is a bit more up to date with things I couldn't figure out if things like proftpd on debian are a community maintained repository or not.. I guess the only real issue is just for services/programs I am running that are facing the internet or that people can access.. So maybe I just need to cut ubuntu some slack and be more aware of the secruity issues? I signed up for the proftpd announce mailing list but im not sure if something like this would be announced there Is there any other mailing list thats good that I should sign up for? What would you do if you were me? "

351,CVE-,sysadmin,OpenSSL's LogJam (CVE-2015-4000) fixes break SMTP email delivery,13,3ay2ez,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/3ay2ez/openssls_logjam_cve20154000_fixes_break_smtp/,2015-06-24 22:38:58,"TLDR; OpenSSL's DH key size changes can break SMTP delivery against older servers when encryption is used. For sendmail (and maybe others?) grep your mail server logs for ""dh key too small"" for errors while delivering and ""alert handshake failure"" for errors while receiving. Recent RHEL/CentOS 6 OpenSSL package (and maybe other distributions) now require Diffie-Hellman (DH) key size of at least 768 bits for TLS connections. In the future it will be raised to 1024 bits. Older servers (for example CentOS 5 default sendmail) by default provides 512 bit DH key. This change breaks SMTP's opportunistic encryption because OpenSSL refuses connections to SMTP servers which support encryption and provide 512 bit DH key. At least sendmail doesn't try to deliver again without encryption (and that is good I think :). CentOS 6's sendmail with OpenSSL logs this error while trying to send: STARTTLS=client: 5269:error:14082174:SSL routines:SSL3_CHECK_CERT_AND_ALGORITHM:dh key too small:s3_clnt.c:3331: And CentOS 5's sendmail with OpenSSL logs this error while trying to receive: STARTTLS=server: 23688:error:14094410:SSL routines:SSL3_READ_BYTES:sslv3 alert handshake failure:s3_pkt.c:1092:SSL alert number 40 How to fix this error: Awareness must be raised. SMTP admins need to hear about this issue. Many organisations might not realise they have 512 bit DH key configured and thus can't receive emails from some senders. The key size should be increased to at least 1024 bits (see OpenSSL's blog below). 4096 bit and bigger size causes other problems (at least with Java), but I don't go there now... Administrators might have to downgrade their OpenSSL package or recompile to be able to support 512 bit DH for email delivery. Or tweak supported cipher suites to eliminate the use of DH. This problem is not specific to OpenSSL. If GnuTLS or any other TLS implementation does the same thing and require certain size of DH key, then the same issue happens. This problem is also not specific to SMTP. Everything using TLS is affected if the connecting end is OpenSSL and server has 512 bit DH. However, SMTP problems might be well hidden.

I'm running Nessus on a virtual machine and I used it to scan my home lan. The problem is that Nessus fails to find vulnerabilities to report. The home lan consists on user-end PCs and Macs, plus a cheap router from the ISP. For testing purposes, I also turned on a computer I had laying around with Debian Lenny (yes, that freaking old and unpatched), and Nessus failed to find vulnerabilities in every host. I also know for a fact that my Mac is vulnerable to the shellshock bug for example, however, I don't think it can be remotely exploited with my current settings. I'm using Nessus Home version 6.2, with the basic scan setting. The scan output reports some vulnerabilities (like the router's configuration webpage is vulnerable to a SSL/TLS Renegotiation handshake), but won't report any CVE vulnerabilities, for example. I'm planning to deploy Nessus on my work network (which I'm responsible for), for regular scans, but if I'm not finding vulnerabilities in a network I'm sure I have them (the debian box, for example), I'm probably doing something wrong. Can anyone help me debug this? I've manually updated the plugins to no avail. Thanks! EDIT: On Nessus, under Policies -&gt; Plugins, all plugin families are enabled."

361,CVE-,sysadmin,OpenSSL Multiple Vulnerabilities,0,2x05zh,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/2x05zh/openssl_multiple_vulnerabilities/,2015-02-25 03:46:06,"Okay, this may be a bit winded but I'm attempting to be as detailed as possible to get some good feedback here. I'm working within vulnerability remediation efforts to resolve a shit ton of backlogged old vulns within my environment. I keep coming across the aforementioned vulnerability (QID 38602 for those who are familiar with Qualys). It's being shown as vulnerable to the following CVE's: * CVE-2010-5298 * CVE-2014-0076 * CVE 2014-0195 * CVE-2014-0198 * CVE-2014-0221 * CVE-2014-0224 * CVE-2014-3470 Now, the thing is, being an OpenSSL vuln, I initially assumed it was outdated openssl installed, thus made packages for the latest and greatest ,etc. Tested installs, ran another scan... still vulnerable. Now with all my digging, the only commonality with all these servers having this vuln is an outdated version of Splunk...which of course is coupled with OpenSSL (0.9.8p). I've been trying to get splunk updated and test to see if this resolves but I have a feeling some will still linger thus still give me a headache. The kicker though, is with the raw qualys scans I get the port which the vuln was found on. They vary WIDELY. Anyone else deal with anything similar or better yet this exactly? Without openssl explicitly installed, why would they be vulnerable to that? Is it more a protocol thing as opposed to the actual libraries/software? Worth mentioning, these are all windows machines.

I ran a recent IVA against it and it came back as having a vulnerability CVE-1999-0169. The remote system is running an NFS server which is configured in such a way that it allows unauthenticated users to manipulate the file system using unverified credentials. This can be accomplished by spoofing the user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) values in NFS RPC call packets. **Impact:** An unauthenticated network-based attacker can leverage this misconfiguration issue to access and modify sensitive files that are present on the remote system with super user privileges. This level of access typically results in a complete compromise of the vulnerable system. * /vol/vol0 -sec=sys,rw,root=192.168.1.0/24:10.0.9.0/24,nosuid * /vol/san01_nfs1 -sec=sys,rw,root=192.168.50.0/24,nosuid * /vol/san01_isos -sec=sys,rw,root=192.168.50.0/24,nosuid * /vol/san01_s0 -sec=sys,rw,root=192.168.50.0/24,nosuid * /vol/san01_t0 -sec=sys,rw,root=192.168.50.0/24,nosuid * /vol/san01_t1 -sec=sys,rw,root=192.168.50.0/24,nosuid URL I personally believe it's my exports.

Re: URL Does anyone know if a fix in the works for this? Microsoft hasn't even acknowledged the CVE from December (CVE-2014-8730) that started all of this. A [single forum post](URL can be found, but it is incorrect anyways stating that only F5 is affected, when they were thought to be the only ones. Granted, I could be assuming the Qualys test is valid. It may not be and is just seeing the specific cipher suites in question."
366,CVE-,sysadmin,Best practice for managing security vulnerability lists?,1,2u7kx9,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/2u7kx9/best_practice_for_managing_security_vulnerability/,2015-01-31 03:32:55,"I'm trying to improve the vulnerability and patch processing at my company and I'd appreciate any advice from people who feel like they have a good system. Basically, I want to track when vulnerabilities are announced by vendors (Microsoft, Cisco, EMC, VMware, etc) to make sure that they are not missed. Here's what I have in mind: 1. Regular sysadmin scheduled task to check vulnerability lists. 1. Insert vulnerability into some type of system to track status (Excel?). 1. Update status to include list of vulnerable vendors and correlate to our installed systems. 1. Identify patched version numbers. 1. Track when individual systems are patched. 1. Roll-up statuses to make sure things aren't missed. **Do you guys just track them all by CVE number, or do you just handle each vendor separately?** It gets tricky when a company like VMware has their security advisories tied to patch releases. For example, [this advisory](URL covers 6 different CVE entries. Of course, this is even more trouble when you have a big CVE like ShellShock that covers dozens of vendors. **Do you have some tool to track them or are you just using Excel, Access or Plain Text?**"
