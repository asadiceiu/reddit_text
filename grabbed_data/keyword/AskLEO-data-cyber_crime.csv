0,cyber crime,AskLEO,"[LONG] Jurisdictional nightmare - Crime was committed electronically and in three states, two PDs could easily have jurisdiction, but feel like things are going super slow",1,i69nc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLEO/comments/i69nc6/long_jurisdictional_nightmare_crime_was_committed/,2020-08-09 10:01:09,"My question won't make much sense without some context, so I'm going to give the quick(ish) background, then ask a few questions. Parties: Myself (Josh) My businesses (Biz 1 and Biz 2) Former friend (Suspect) Around the end of last year I gave the then friend, now suspect, access to my personal email address which was linked to a lot of online services, including my banking. He was appointed as the CFO. At the time, I was having some health issues and he had the chance to do a few hours of work a day for a few weeks and could have solved my problems. If he needed any help or didn't want to help, that would have been fine. What ended up happening was he embezzled over $27,000, stole copies of databases and other intellectual property, and transferred the customer base of a well established business to his business, effectively robbing me. Fast forward, I talk to attorneys, file a law suit in Virginia. I say Virginia, because that is where Biz 1 and Biz 2 have conducted business, paid taxes, etc. Under VA embezzlement laws jurisdiction is established by where the funds would need to be returned to, so in this case, a Virginia business so they have jurisdiction. Independent of that, he remotely accesses servers physically located in Virginia and altered the networks of the same. Based on his cyber trespass, according to VA code, that says they also get Jursidiction. In an attempt to downplay his theft, he filed a civil law suit in Utah slightly before I filed mine in Virginia. The Virginia suit is for over $15 million, the Utah suit he filed against me was for $50k. Him and his attorneys have all veritably lied to the court. At a hearing this week the Virginia court, at the request of the suspects attorneys, abstained from the case and dismissed it without prejudice on the grounds that since there was already litigation pending in Utah, it wouldn't effectively be fair to try the same case in two different courts. So back in March I filed a report with the Fairfax county, VA police and they have been working the case. I appreciate the work they've done and they have stayed engaged with it, which I really appreciate. However, the suspect living in Utah does create some logistical issues (I presume), despite there being solid legal standing for Virginia to have jursidiction. The suspect has sworn under perjury that not only they did take the files and money, but also stated that they did it from either California or Utah, and since the beginning of this year they have been living in Utah. Frankly, I don't really care what court holds him accountable for theft, but I'm confused because what I'm looking at is a pile of claims I made stating he stole from me along with committing other crimes, he confesses to it under penalty of perjury and through his attorney, so I have a slam dunk criminal case against him, but for some reason he is still actively using the courts to further his embezzlement. &amp;#x200B; So, of course, I don't expect officers to take my word for it, but I have statements the suspect has filed in the civil case admitting to the actions which were criminal. I've forwarded it to both the VA and the Utah police. Since the Virginia courts have abstained from the civil case, I have another hearing in Utah in about 10 days. The Utah courts may very well abstain and it may get sent back to Virginia (which, given the facts I think would be the appropriate venue), but until that happens, as it sits now, a Virginia court has said this is a Utah issue. &amp;#x200B; I'm extremely frustrated. At this point would I have the option to make a citizens arrest? Should I contact a watch commander? Should I just patiently wait for what feels like nothing to happen? I would understand the delay better if there wasn't both concrete verifiable evidence and confessions from him, but it just feels like the inaction is coming from perhaps the jursidictional issues? &amp;#x200B; Any suggestions or feedback would be appreciated. &amp;#x200B; Thanks for reading!"
1,cyber crime,AskLEO,Why is there so much overlap for investigation duties for US federal law enforcement agencies?,1,i8vdj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLEO/comments/i8vdj1/why_is_there_so_much_overlap_for_investigation/,2020-08-13 17:15:13,"I was doing a bit of research on the FBI, ATF, DEA &amp; ICE-HSI i noticed all 4 agencies have overlap in their duties. FBI: - domestic and international terrorism - foreign counterintelligence - cyber crime, public corruption - civil rights - organized crime/drugs - white-collar crime - violent crimes And a lot more DEA: - Investigation and preparation for the prosecution of major violators of controlled substance laws operating at interstate and international levels. - Investigation and preparation for prosecution of criminals and drug gangs who perpetrate violence in our communities and terrorize citizens through fear and intimidation - Seizure and forfeiture of assets derived from, traceable to, or intended to be used for illicit drug trafficking. ATF: - Conducting investigations of violations relating to explosives, firearms, firearm trafficking, arson, and alcohol and tobacco diversion. ICE-HSI - Financial crimes, money laundering and bulk cash smuggling; - Commercial fraud and intellectual property theft; - Cybercrimes; - Human rights violations; - Human smuggling and trafficking; - Immigration, document and benefit fraud; - Narcotics and weapons smuggling/trafficking; - Transnational gang activity; - Export enforcement; and, - International art and antiquity theft Is the reason for overlap in HSI duties due it being under the DHS while FBI, ATF &amp; DEA under the DOJ? or is HSI a catch all agency?"

3,cyber crime,AskLEO,Are law enforcement related masters programs really that helpful for federal agencies?,1,hebciy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLEO/comments/hebciy/are_law_enforcement_related_masters_programs/,2020-06-23 19:16:50,"Im 20 years old and entering my senior year as a history major. The plan is to graduate next spring. Originally, I had planned on going local PD out of college (Ive taken the exam but cannot go forward with the hiring process until Im 21), but Im almost positive Id like to continue my education. Ive been doing quite a bit of research regarding federal agencies and what they look for in applicants. The agency Ive been the most interested in is the FBI. And everywhere Ive read, it states the FBI does not have a required major, but the FBI does has a preference for those that have studied: Financing, accounting, language or computer science. Which of course makes sense. While having a history degree is technically still acceptable. I feel as if it makes me a weak candidate in the future. Therefore, Ive been considering completing my masters in something law enforcement related. Not just CJ, but potentially homeland security, cyber security. One program that interested me was international crime and justice. The program description reads Graduates of the program will enter the job market equipped with advanced, substantive knowledge and the analytical and research skills necessary to pursue careers in Comparative Policing, Counterterrorism, Environmental Criminology, Criminal Analysis, International Human Rights, Financial Crimes/Financial Compliance, Anti-Money Laundering, and Anti-Corruption among others. While selecting my current major, I was told not to choose anything law enforcement related which is why I chose history. I regret it. And I think about it every day. Anyway, will the programs I mentioned above really give me more of a chance to be competitive? Or would it still not be as practical/competitive for federal LE as a STEM would?"
4,cyber crime,AskLEO,Interesting developments - what to expect from an informal interview?,1,deo5mo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLEO/comments/deo5mo/interesting_developments_what_to_expect_from_an/,2019-10-08 06:13:31,"A while back, I posted here about considering a career in law enforcement - particularly, in cyber-crime. Several weeks ago, I was in the middle of a live-hacker situation at work - I own an IT company. Regional police got involved and sent a detective over from the cyber unit. 12 hours later, I gave him a package with logs, user information and OSINT pointing to a specific person with a geolocated IP address - the works. That has lead to a significant development in that event. Hopefully soon, an arrest. Fast forward to last week - I'm sitting down with the detective for coffee. I've advised him I was in fact looking to chase a career as a cyber LEO. Among other details in the conversation, he's mentioning that I'm hitting a lot of the boxes they look for - community involvement, fitness and such. He mentions he wants to set up a meeting with the recruiters and maybe the cyber team. Texts me later saying his boss wants to sit down - TOMORROW - for coffee. What should I expect from a meeting like this?"

I would like to share screenshots here of some things I have screen shotted, but more come every hour. He is a lifeguard and talks about having sex with people at the pool, including saying he deserves head from a specific girl he helped/saved in the pool last week. He also talks about killing/shooting people. I dont know for sure what town he lives in to report to his local police. I know he has been sent away to psychiatric hospitals in the past and is probably supposed to be / may take medication for mental illness, but it clearly is not working. He is in a position of power over the public as a lifeguard and Im very afraid he will rape someone, soon. He talks all the time about how things like innocence should be taken at a younger age and how women should give him sex just because. I thought of maybe reporting him to FBI but not sure if this is a cyber crime? I really just think he needs to be on a watch list and Im not sure if hes actually committed a crime by saying these things, but he shouldnt be a lifeguard or have any job with a power dynamic over others. If I can I will share screen shots of his Facebook posts."

I find myself in prison most of the time, and the other part of the time in the field whenever police equipment goes down. Anywhere that I'm needed. My question is very serious. Even though I am not LEO I see and hear horrible traumatic things. Some of them pictures/videos if I'm working on specific equipment that involves evidence collection for cyber crimes. Or crime scene photos and all the normal things Officers deal with every day. The other part of my job involves listening and overhearing the evil vile things inmates have done. I've heard all the stories in the book. Graphic murder details that if I shared would haunt your dreams and keep you up at night. As I'm sure many of you know full well. I am technically a civilian but have active roles in both departments. I'm finding it harder and harder to deal with the things I see and overhear. Especially things involving children. I can only block out so much and become hardened to it. There are things I've seen I'll never forget, things that dominate my psyche. My question is what are some tips to deal with these things besides therapy? I find it hard talking with anyone in my line of work because it comes across as weakness. It's also impossible to speak about these things with the family or people outside of work for obvious reason. Any suggestions? I know this is a very hard subject and everyone here that is an officer has seen horrible things and maybe wrestles or had wrestled with this topic at some point"

I sent my local police office an online tip. What else should I do? I need this information taken down. Associating my real life name with false accusations is one thing, but she posted so much of my personal information. Will anything be taken to make her take this down, at all? She's not in the same state as me, and I'm worried the police office won't take this seriously if I say, walk in tomorrow, and provide evidence. I'm in Arkansas.
