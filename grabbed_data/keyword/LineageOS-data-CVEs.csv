Is this the upstream kernel for onyx? Is it the kernel that the default installation of lineage for onyx uses? And are the kernels listed under ""oneplus"" that say msmXXX usable for my phone?"

I definitely don't like seeing ""May 5"" in my device settings but knowing it's actually more like a March patch level for the kernel and stuff based on the CVE tracker."
