I am 18+ and every person and character involved with this rp must also be 18+. &lt;PARTNER SEARCH&gt;. 1. Human knight and elf: so with this Idea, I was thinking of something along the lines of a elf being held captive by the enemy side(the humans) and I'm one of his guards. We can expand this out or make it fully lewd, up to you. 2. Humanxfurry: For this scenario, the world has allowed humans and furries to live together as one and allowed to crossbreed. Now we're just your average college couple who live in a small apartment together. Also it doesn't matter who plays the furry but usually im the one who is the furry. I sometimes do a poly with this but usually I play as 2 characters. 3. Android partner: this one is pretty simple, I build you with parts I find in an abandoned android shop so that you may be.. a helper of sorts. 4. Anything you want!: im into most scenarios like fantasy, sci-fi, games, interracial, FNAF, ect. 5. 3 person rp: for this we can try maybe having an extra sub but it'll go along with any of the role plays I have listed 6. Monster girl island: I run a resort where all kinds of monster girls come to reside and relax! 7. Pokemon- For this I would be the trainer and I'd go out into the world to find pokemon and ""train"" them ;) 8. Ghost boyfriend- For this scenario, I'd lose a bet and have to spend the night at a haunted house and find out that there's a lovely ghost girl living there. 9. Cyber punk scenario- for this I was thinking that we'd be in our own crew of sorts, we can discuss the name of is on kik, and we've been partners in crime for years but over time we eventually become more than just friends My kik is Gypsy452 and I hope to see you there"
