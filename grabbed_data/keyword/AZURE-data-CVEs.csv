I have currently enabled Standard Security Center tier for ACI which means my images are being scanned within 10 minutes after being pushed to the registry, this is done by Qualys. I am able to make this process work flawlessly. More info here: [URL &amp;#x200B; I however wanted to know if anyone knows if there is a way to re-scan images afterwards? My issue is that some images we have are not updated for a while, that means that an image might be OK at time of scanning, but months or years later that same images might already have one or more CVEs and my security recommendations in Security Center won't let me know because it wasn't rescanned by Qualys. &amp;#x200B; So basically I wanted to know if there is a way to rescan images autoamtically (periodically), or if the only way to do this is to re-push the same image at a later point in time whenever I want to check for vulnerabilities? &amp;#x200B; Thank you!!"
