0,cyber crime,computerforensics,Is college required for computer forensics in government?,1,i4g6km,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerforensics/comments/i4g6km/is_college_required_for_computer_forensics_in/,2020-08-06 09:15:29,"My plan is to be self taught... I don't have a college degree. Certainly it might be harder to get the job without a college degree but I just want to know if it's even possible to get a government job **without** having to pull strings from higher ups. Also, if this requirement exists, would this requirement apply for companies that work with the government? Like for example, a nonprofit company that works with law enforcement to fight cyber-related crime. Would I need a college degree for this company?"
1,cyber crime,computerforensics,Would you have some suggestions about breaking into the industry considering my experience and interests?,1,hpdnbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerforensics/comments/hpdnbk/would_you_have_some_suggestions_about_breaking/,2020-07-12 03:11:43,"Hello! Would you have some suggestions about breaking into the industry considering my experience and interests? I earned an unrelated Bachelor's degree some years ago. It looks like paths to break in to the industry involve going back to school, taking relevant courses, and/or self-study (or a combination of all of the above). I have no forensics experience but I do have IT experience that I think is transferable. Picking some topics: networking, hard drive recovery, configuring VMs, remote access like Telnet, basic PC security/privacy, and more. I'm not too keen on 2-4 years of university if I don't necessarily need it (I work full-time), but I am willing to take the necessary path(s) of study. Knowing the information I presented above, what education path would you suggest? I'm also wondering how the education path I pick would impact my future employment prospects? I have some details below about what work I'm looking to target. I've been thinking about what kind of work within forensics I'd like to target. Based on what I've been reading I know more about what type of work I would like to *avoid*. I do not want to view violent crime footage like murders or illicit pics (CP) so I don't think working full-time for law enforcement would be for me. Therefore I'm thinking about aiming for private sector work or perhaps government cyber work not involving the aforementioned crimes. I've been reading the FAQ and have a book on the way to get started with educating myself in this area. Thank you very much for your advice!"
2,cyber crime,computerforensics,Question about computer forensics career,1,hh6rar,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerforensics/comments/hh6rar/question_about_computer_forensics_career/,2020-06-28 12:34:51,I wanted to ask those who work in this field. What is your day to day? I read about those who work in the computer forensics fields and so far it seems like they: - retrieve and recover data through the use of software and troubleshooting techniques to get the data out - look through the data to see the evidence that legal is asking for - look through logs and analytics to try to find patterns about Cyber crime - document the hell out of everything - testify in court - be really good at exploiting tech and being a really good techie Is that all? Am I missing? How much of your day is troubleshooting and solving technical problems? Are you looking at trends and analyzing and researching technical information? Just wondering because I like the idea of investigating stuff. But I hate troubleshooting and find tech to be a very boring subject and really freaking annoying to work with

CompTIA A+, off-the-books IT experience, working on GCIH. Prioritize getting more DF certs or bite the bullet and go back to college?** I currently work as a law enforcement intelligence analyst at the local level. I had never had any formal computer training when I started, but as the most tech-savvy guy in the room I got assigned to cyber threat intelligence and IT liaison work (documenting our unit-specific computer configurations, talking to vendors about new products, etc.) Since being assigned to this area two years ago, I've sought out whatever training I could get through work, and paid my way to an A+ cert (currently studying for my Network+ on my own dime). Since getting my A+, my tasks have evolved to more project management related (working as a go-between for our law enforcement units and IT program development team) and providing more PC tech support (working to document everything with the help desk so we don't evolve a ""shadow IT""). As I've been studying computer and cyber courses, I've become more and more obsessed with learning digital forensics. I recently completed the free Autopsy 8-hour class, and convinced my bosses to send me to SANS for their SEC504 / GCIH class. However, my job description (and pay) is still as a junior crime analyst even as my actual role has evolved to more of a LE tech-services role. I have 10 years in the agency (switched a couple years ago from 911 dispatch), and a bachelors degree in criminology. I've talked to people at my agency's computer crimes unit, but it's entirely sworn law enforcement and they are wary of bringing in civilians considering the most common criminal subject matter and government agencies are generally change-averse. My question is - As someone who would like to transition into a more digital forensics role, am I best off trying to get more certifications or going back to school for a 2nd bachelors or a masters? I hope to have my Network+ in the next couple months (currently prepping for SANS which, due to the spent cost, is a much higher priority at the moment), and figured I would go for the Security+ after that just to finish the CompTIA triad. But I've got a family and a mortgage - and unless I get reassigned to a role with higher pay I can't afford to pay out of pocket for training or a degree that won't benefit me financially in the medium term. I'd like to stay with my agency if I can get that kind of role, and given that I still have 20+ years to my pension I would hope to convince them in the investment, but the role I'm looking for doesn't currently exist and would likely be a hard-sell. I'd like to strengthen my case as much as possible, while also being aware that I likely need a lot more training and experience to be qualified as an examiner. Thank you for any insight you can offer."

9,cyber crime,computerforensics,I think I experienced a cyber crime while employed in a major sports league and need help understanding what happened.,0,8xn02z,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerforensics/comments/8xn02z/i_think_i_experienced_a_cyber_crime_while/,2018-07-10 18:31:11,"This turned out longer than I initially planned -- sorry in advance for the essay. The main reason I'm posting this story is because I want to figure out what really happened. I still have the system logs, network activity, Slack conversations, and several screenshots from the night I mention. I don't know how much of it is relevant, but if there's something in there that someone with iOS or network security can decipher, I would want to talk to them, if only for my own sanity. There are things that happened here that are my own fault, and due to my technical naivety. I'm just looking for advice on what my options are and to understand the situation, not a reprimand for the poor decision-making. About 2 years ago, I was working at a media/tech company under the umbrella of a major sports league when this happened. The league's tech side (~2000 people) acquired the software company I worked at (~50 people) in fall 2015. This was my first job right after college in summer 2015 and I was officially hired as the merger was announced. I work in UI design, and my software and IT knowledge was lacking at the time. I was bringing my personal macbook to the office, and doing most of my work through there for a few months. After the company was acquired, I continued to do so. My work laptop was several years old and too slow for Adobe software that I was using daily. Around late spring of 2016, I started noticing unusual behavior on my work laptop. Recent searches appearing that I never typed, new Spotlight search recommendations like Activity Monitor and Network tools, apps accessed that I never use, files opened that I rarely access. One example is with the Dropbox app - my personal account was connected to my work computer, and I noticed my selective sync settings kept changing to sync my personal folders, which I explicitly made sure to exclude. I had to keep changing them almost daily. I ended up staying late one Friday night to try to fix it. I thought changing my work computer permissions would stop it, and surprise, it stopped working after that genius idea. I still had my personal computer with me, which I started using at that point. I pinged a coworker on Slack who confirmed that the company does indeed have remote access to our machines through Meraki, and that he uses Little Snitch to block access. He sent me the link to it and I downloaded it. He suggested I boot the work laptop into single user mode to fix those permissions and sent some links to help. At this point, it's 9pm and there's a dev who's also staying late. I tell him what's going on with the permissions and all and he sends me other links, and tells me to run those commands to fix it. None of them work or really change anything. I attempt to call our company 24/7 IT support but it goes to voicemail. I message a few more people on Hipchat, but no one can really help. Eventually, I drive directly home. Once I get home, I see this Little Snitch tool constantly pinging me on my personal machine, but can't recall what the notifications said. I changed some of the settings, which might've have opened some kind of door. Windows start popping on my screen for system settings and I hear that apple lock sound open, which I quickly click to counteract. Essentially, I go into panic mode and start defending my computer against all these attacks which are happening seconds apart. Notifications that looked inauthentic and almost like a fake Apple UI with blurry icons keep popping up requesting my password, which I try to exit from (relevant later). At some point in the night, I booted into recovery mode and saw what looked like another drive, or some kind of connection, that was accessing to my computer. I could see their recently viewed files and saw that my Dropbox folder was being viewed. The only folder I was was able to see in their directory before they disconnected was called Power Management. I tried to create a Firmware password but I think it was too late at that point. The password I setup wasn't even letting me in. When I called Apple after the Firmware lockout, they asked me if my operating system was bootleg, and doubted the authenticity of my operating system. I end up taking it to the Apple store that day and I remember the CS agent sounding genuinely concerned on the phone. I have no idea why they would think my operating system was inauthentic and I can't really explain how that would happen. I got in the office late that following Monday and was really distraught after messing up both my work and personal computers. The IT guy gave me a loaner machine to use in the meantime. I am still seeing the activity I saw on my original work machine that prompted my suspicion in the first place like the recommended Spotlight searches of network activity files and Activity Monitor that never came up in the past. I end up looking into system logs and console activity and not really understanding what I'm looking at, but I still save it. It starts getting really late at this point, like 2 am and I am there alone. And this is the really fucked up part when I start to hear noises throughout the office. Two women talking to each other like they're having a conversation. They're whispering to each other, and I can't make out what they're actually saying, but it's loud enough that I can hear it. I start walking around the office trying to find where it's coming from, but I can't find the source, as I'm the only one there. After going back to my computer, I realize what's going on right now is that there is someone actively mirroring my display and viewing my screen via an Apple TV or other possible connected devices. At just the right moment, I'm able to change settings and see their their desktop, completely different from mine. It quickly goes back to my screen as they disconnect. I also realize there's a remote connection via a Mac Mini, and I was able to view their widgets screen. None of this would ever on this computer before. As I walk back to my desk, I see one of the employees walking away in the distance towards his house, the same guy who sent me links on changing permissions. At this point it's 7am and the receptionist is making coffee. I start to hear people talking again coming from an office near the main door. As I walk towards this office, the receptionist enters through the main door, and is walking towards me in the opposite direction. There is a burst of laughter, very loudly and clearly, from that office I'm about to walk into. The receptionist and I both look at each other and I say explicitly, ""You heard that, right?"" and she confirms that she did and we both see no one there. I go back to my desk and see the first dev arrive. When I walk away from his area, I hear the first voices I heard of the women. This time, I can clearly hear her say, ""Is she gone?"" and when I approach, the dev is just standing over someone's empty desk responding when there's no one else there. Like he's speaking into a mic or something. I wonder if this was all just a sick prank and if this all of those sounds were being sent on some kind of speaker. There is much more that happened afterwards regarding HR, an attempt to escalate the issue, and verbal harassment until I had no choice but to quit. All of this raises some very disturbing questions... although management is allowed to monitor employees, at what point does it become malicious behavior? And who was it that kept viewing mirroring my display when I was there that night? I believe what was happening in my situation was malicious. What I'm asking in this post is how would one go about proving this in various system logs, what do I need to show, who would I even talk to to confirm this? For instance, when I saw the screen change to the mirrored desktop, is there a specific process I can look at in system logs to show this was happening? It seemed like whoever was remotely connecting was not part of the IT or management, who I assume would have those types of privileges. And even then, I doubt how ethical it is to cast someone's screen on an Apple TV, as opposed to using the proper software. To me, this seems like a crime, and I want to know how to prove that. I'm not sure if this is the proper subreddit for this story, and looking for all the help I can get, so I'll be posting to similar channels as well. TLDR: While working at my former job, I experienced remote connections to my computer. I saved log files and online conversations and want to understand on a technical level what happened and who I can talk to about this."

15,cyber crime,computerforensics,[cx posted /r/cscareerquestions] Advice needed: lawyer transitioning to to computer forensics investigator/expert witness,2,3t31ye,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerforensics/comments/3t31ye/cx_posted_rcscareerquestions_advice_needed_lawyer/,2015-11-17 10:27:34,"Hello, I'm looking for advice. I'm a practicing attorney with a focus on civil litigation (mostly IP - both hard and soft, but also some cyber investigation work). I'm fairly new in the field and I am paid well but I don't think I am as happy as I could be. The best part of my job is tracking bad people down online: coming up with an investigation plan, issuing subpoenas, digging through complicated layers of digital evidence and just generally using metadata to put together the puzzle that identifies the author of anonymous content online in a way that would be admissible at trial. I'm good at this, and it's the kind of work I'm willing to spend 60 hours a week doing. I don't like the more ""lawyer"" part of my job: writing long memos on complicated/theoretical questions of law and thinking about problems that seem academic. (E.g. please write me a memo that analyzes the legal meaning of the word ""sale"" in New York). I hate this part of my job, and its what most attorneys spend 60 hours a week doing. I don't know how much longer I can do this part of my job without wanting to jump off a building. With that in mind, part of me wants to transition into computer forensics, and either work for law enforcement or as an expert witness. Here are my questions: * I am self-taught (and learning more every day) regarding computer forensics/hacking/cyber crime. I think I need more formal training to transition in a different career -- such as a degree in computer science. Do you agree or disagree with my assessment? Is there something else you would suggest? * If do need more formal training, would I need to go back to school and get a second bachelors in computer science, or would it be possible to get an advanced degree in a related field? I don't want to spend a bunch of money to do this the wrong way. (FWIW, my undergraduate degree is in Political Science from a state university and my law degree is from one of the top law schools in the U.S. I have a high GPA for both, if that matters for admissions.) In some ways, getting a bachelors feels like going backwards. * What schools do you recommend? What schools should I avoid because they are scams? * Am I being unrealistic? Do you have any other suggestions? Thank you so much! "
