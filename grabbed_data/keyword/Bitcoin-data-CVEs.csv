They've taken everything we had, not just from us, from our fathers and from our fathers' fathers. **Stan**: And from our fathers' fathers' fathers. **r/Bitcoin**: Yes. **Stan**: And from our fathers' fathers' fathers' fathers. **r/Bitcoin**: All right, Stan. Don't labour the point. And what have they ever given us in return? **Xerxes**: Scalability fixes for bitcoind? **r/Bitcoin**: Oh yeah, yeah they gave us that. Yeah. That's true. **Masked Activist**: And headers-first synchronization? **Stan**: Oh yes... headers-first, Reddit, you remember what block downloads used to be like! **r/Bitcoin**: All right, I'll grant you that the scalability fixes and the headers-first are two things that the core devs have done... **Matthias**: And the 24 CVEs... **r/Bitcoin**: *(sharply)* Well yes obviously they patched the security issues... the 24 CVEs go without saying! But apart from the scalability fixes, headers-first synchronization and the 24 CVEs... **Another Masked Activist**: Serialization cleanups... **Other Masked Voices**: libsecp256k1... Merged thousands of pull requests... S-Value mutability... **r/Bitcoin**: Yes... all right, fair enough... **Activist Near Front**: And the levelDB error handling... **Omnes**: Oh yes! True! **Francis**: Yeah. That's something we'd really miss if the core-devs left, Reddit. **Masked Activist at Back**: Hierarchical wallet seeds! **Stan**: And it's safe to backup your wallets now, Reddit. **Francis**: Yes, they certainly know how to keep bitcoins secure... *(general nodding)*... let's face it, they're the only ones who could in a place like this. *(more general murmurs of agreement)* **r/Bitcoin**: All right... all right... but apart from HD wallets and levelDB error handling and S-Value mutability mitigations and thousands of merged pull requests and libsecp256k1 and serialization cleanups and a headers-first-synchronization and scalability work and security fixes... what have the core-devs done for us? **Xerxes**: libbitcoinconsensus! **r/Bitcoin**: What!? Oh... *(scornfully)* libbitcoinconsesus, yes... shut up! *[ Stolen gratefully from Monty Python's Life of Brian and URL ]*"
