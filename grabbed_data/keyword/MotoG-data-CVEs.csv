0,CVEs,MotoG,[INFO] LineageOS CVE Tracker for Moto G devices,6,713vbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotoG/comments/713vbr/info_lineageos_cve_tracker_for_moto_g_devices/,2017-09-20 01:49:33,"**What is this?** The CVE tracker is a manual way for maintainers to keep track of the patch status of CVEs for the kernels used in official devices. **What's a CVE?** Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. These are security holes which could be used by an attacker to get access to your data. Due to other security measures in the Android OS like SELinux, most of these vulnerabilities can't be exploited and are just theoretical. **The kernel for my device is only at x%, why is it so insecure?** Please note that the tracker needs to be manually updated by each device maintainer and it does not necessarily represent the real patch status of the kernel. &amp;nbsp; Codename|Device|Patched Vulnerabilities| :--|:--|:--| athene|Moto G4 / G4 Plus|29%| harpia|Moto G4 Play|90% merlin|Moto G Turbo|90%| osprey|Moto G3|90%| thea|Moto G2 LTE|97%| titan|Moto G2|97%| peregrine|Moto G LTE|97%| falcon|Moto G|97%| &amp;nbsp; **TL;DR** Moto G4 Plus is the least secure among all Moto G phones when it comes to security patches updates on LineageOS. The security patch level that you see in Settings &gt; About Phone is misleading. The LineageOS maintainer for your device has to manually patch it himself. &amp;nbsp; **Source**: URL"

Two of those red CVEs are apparently the original vulnerabilties, so wtf: &gt; and brought this to Google's attention on August 15. In response, Google assigned CVE-2015-3876 and CVE-2015-6602 to the pair of reported issues and started working on a fix. [Source](URL ). Is this a failure of this detector app?
