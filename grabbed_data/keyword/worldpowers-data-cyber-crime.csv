As per the order of the Director of the Armed Forces with final approval from the National Champion, all necessary measures are to immediately be taken to ensure the defense of Canada's sovereignty and the security of the Canadian and now American People. Amendments should be based on the internal knowledge of US operations based on [OPERATION WATCHING EYES](URL which is an intelligence gathering operation initiated under Defense Plan Hope Not.""* -------------- **Situation Report** &gt;The United States Federal Government, now considered the ""Rebellion"" has repeatedly launched genocidal and war-crime level attacks on it's own people. It is clear that this reign of terror must come to an end and this sentiment is [heavily supported](URL by both the media and [Canadians as a whole](URL &gt;As such the People's Federation of Canada has **recognized the American Republic** both as a **sovereign state** and as the **successor to the United States of America**. This recognition marks the **first major** recognition by a foreign power of the American Republic, and is expected to be a floodgate-esque event. Furthermore the People's Federation of Canada has pledged itself to ensuring the safety of the American people and prevention of any further terrorist-styled events. &gt;The United States Federal Government is surrounded on all sides, in the Great Plains and Deep South the US-FEDs are fighting a losing battle. It was therefore the plan of the United States Federalists to reinforce and [secure](URL the State of Alaska. However when the United States [initially began building for a Fortress Alaska](URL they neglected many **key points and areas**. Furthermore the entirety of [US Alaskan capabilities](URL have all but been destroyed following a significant military strike by the Pacific Republic. This includes the airports of Kenai, Fairbank, Kodiak, Homer, Juneau, Bethel, Ketchikan, and Sitka (but is not limited to). This has left the **war-criminal federal government** highly vulnerable in a number of key areas, listed below. &gt;&gt;**FOOD:** For one, the issue of food, as the State of Alaska simply does not have the fertile land to produce enough food for it's population to live beyond a substance lifestyle, let alone 200,000 American Soldiers who require a much heartier and healthier diet. This meant that logistics would have to had included plans for food shipments to occur within the logistical train to Alaska, which relied on access to the US Pacific be it Hawaii or the CONUS. This they have lost, and as 85-90% of Alaska **relies partially or fully on a subsistence based lifestyle** the food-situation is highly fragile for American forces. Therefore it is believed that the **rural populations** will be suffering greatly as their foodsupplies dwindle due to USFORCES requirements. Furthermore the Dutch Forces which had been transited into the area as part of the effort to support **war criminals**, will continue to drain on the food-supply of what remains of the **skeleton US Federal forces**. &gt;&gt;**MUNITIONS:** The US munitions situation is not much better, as the US Feds lost most of their munition factories to either the American Republic or to the other two secessionist forces. And with the war continuing to rage on, the inability for Federalist forces to resupply will begin to strain and break the Federalist war effort. Furthermore while the US Feds built multiple marine docks for constructing large scale vessels, they never built major munitions factories. The same can be said for the US Federal Fuel Supply. &gt;&gt;**MORALE:** Alaska is a harsh and brutal landscape, it's people are hearty and the environment can be sinister. For American forces still deployed in Alaska to Bases Wainright, Elemendorf-Richardson, and other bases as part of the existing deployment (any IRL stuff), morale will be **extremely low**. With uprisings on all sides, and the **regular people of Alaska** refuting the war and **the Federal Government** in droves, it is clear that the population of **only 800,000 or so** truly do **not want war**. &gt;&gt;**ISOLATION:** Ultimately the State of Alaska is isolated, and as the US Feds neglected to beef up cyber and communication capabilities in CONUS, the same can be seen in their Alaska preparations which focused more on simply building shelters to live in and installing minor THAAD equipment. This isolation leaves US Forces with very few ways to evacuate. &gt;It is clear that the situation in Alaska is fragile and set to break. We must avoid creating a ""Alaskan ISIS"" and therefore our ROE must remain controlled and precise. Furthermore we must recognize that the people in rural Alaska either **don't know about the war, or don't care** as they maintain their subsistence based lifestyles. Additionally those in ""urban Alaska"" generally are in the same boat, ""*Unrest in Alaska began to grow afterwards, as the strikes hammered home the reality of the war and the local population began to resent that the Federal fortress state in Alaska had made them a target.""* ~ Report on the War of Two Empires &gt;With this in mind, WAR PLAN - HOPE has now been initiated. ---------------------------- ##**OPERATION - WE ARE HERE** **Note: OPERATION - WE ARE HERE will start just as Canadian Forces begin entering Alaska by land/sea, and as aircraft are within 10 minutes of target destinations** **SITUATION AND INFORMATION** &gt;**Situation:** With the US Federal Government largely destroyed in CONUS, the 7th Army failing to reach Alaska to support the Fortress State, and **large-scale unrest within the Alaskan Populace**, it is time to initiate our WAR PLAN in support of the American Republic. OPERATION - WE ARE HERE is therefore our attempt in ensuring a **peaceful ceding** of power from US Federal authorities in Alaska, to Canadian Officials. **Involved Units** &gt;&gt;**The People's Government of Canada** &gt;&gt;**The Cyber-warfare Center of Canada** **OPERATIONAL INFORMATION** &gt;**OPERATIONAL REVIEW:** The Canadian Government in cooperation with the Cyber-warfare center of Canada will be attempting to see a peaceful resolution to this conflict, before it even starts. By launching a series of requests for **unconditional surrender** not to the **war-criminal - terrorists of the ECC** but to the **commanding officers of the various military bases** and to the **cities of Alaska** as a whole. &gt;**WE ARE HERE** &gt;&gt;As Canadian Forces begin rushing through Alaskan territory, and as the **aircraft are within 5 minutes of their targets** contact will be made with the commanders of the target-bases and of the mayors, governors, and **general populace** of the major Alaskan cities of Fairbanks, Anchorage, and Juneau. The message is simple and will consist of a single message to avoid confusion or interference. (Note that the 10 minute count-down is specifically for the immediate communication, additional time is provided for the lights, however if they act in bad faith - total destruction will occur) &gt;&gt;""Surrender, lay down your arms, the Canadian Forces are entering to ensure peace and the removal of the **war criminals of the ECC**. The ECC has brought this war to the mountains of Alaska, the people of Alaska can **end this war.** &gt;&gt;To the Soldier, lay down your arms, surrender completely. Canadian aircraft and forces are already within reach. Canadian Satellites, Radars, and reconnaissance aircraft already are locked onto **all bases and locations of Alaska**. Submit via the confirmed communication cable - an unconditional surrender and light your runway or open area (parking lot, whatever) in a plus sign, in addition to responding to this message. This will confirm your surrender and you will be met with a Canadian force to cede control of the base, followed by entering Canadian captivity for debriefing from this war, before being permitted to return to **wherever your home might be**. As we have **total eyes** on your movements and actions, we will be aware if **anything beyond this is conducted**. Should you **fail to respond to this message** within 5 minutes, Canadian aircraft will destroy the base. Should you fail to light up the area in a plus sign, Canadian forces will strike the base. **Should vehicles or other types of equipment or personnel** attempt to leave or otherwise move within the base, **the base will be destroyed. You are outnumbered, and unlike the US Federal forces, we come bringing food, medical supplies, and other essentials for the Alaskan people and for you** &gt;&gt;To the Individual (cities), Canadian forces will be momentarily taking control of your cities and towns, please cooperate fully as we **distribute humanitarian aid, food, and other essentials** to ensure the **survival of All Alaskan People during this winter**. We seek no conflict with the **civilians of Alaska**, our issue remains solely with the **war criminals of the ECC** that have **allowed the American People to burn in CONUS**."" ~ Full Message &gt;This message will be distributed to **all Alaskan military installations** and to **the major cities and towns of Alaska**. -------------- ##[**OPERATION - WINGS OF FREEDOM**](URL *Note: All operations are occurring concurrently* **SITUATION AND INFORMATION** &gt;**Situation:** With news that the US Federalists are attempting to eliminate and destroy the Pacific Republic and American Republic the Canadian Forces has deemed it important that the threats to our immediate allies and ourselves are eliminated efficiently while minimizing civilian casualties. &gt;**Timing:** Forces under OPERATION WINGS OF FREEDOM will be within 5 minutes of targets, should the US bases fail to surrender, they will be destroyed. &gt;**Involved Units** &gt;&gt;**Tactical Air Group Three ""Wings of Freedom"":** Consisting of one of 4 premier F-35A Battle Groups, and accompanied by 5 Mosquito-wingmen Battle Groups, the Air Tactical Group 3 is primarily based out of CFRH Vancouver and secondarily out of CFRH Whitehorse for command purposes, with access to a multitude of Canadian Pacific Bases and locations. &gt;&gt;3rd Battle Group ""Red Eagle"" &gt;&gt;11th Mosquito Battle Group &gt;&gt;12th Mosquito Battle Group &gt;&gt;13th Mosquito Battle Group &gt;&gt;14th Mosquito Battle Group &gt;&gt;15th Mosquito Battle Group &gt;&gt;**Tactical Air Group Four ""Flying Victory"":** Air Tactical Group Four consists of one of 4 premier F-35A Battle Groups and 5 Mosquito wingmen Battle Groups, and is primarily used on rotation depending on operation. As it pertains to Operation Wings of Freedom, ""Flying Victory"" will be primarily operating out of CFRH Vancouver (for administrative purposes) and multiple Canadian bases in the [Pacific Region of CFAR.](URL &gt;&gt;4th Battle Group ""Soaring Falcon"" &gt;&gt;16th Mosquito Battle Group &gt;&gt;20th Mosquito Battle Group &gt;&gt;**The Canadian Aerial Hotshots ""Pacific"":** The Canadian Aerial Hotshots are the premier aerial firefighting unit of Canada, comprising [20 CL215/CL415](URL They are primarily based out of CFRH Vancouver, and utilize Canadian Forces locations in the Pacific CFAR. &gt;&gt;**The Canadian Aerial Hotshots ""Prairies"":** The Canadian Aerial Hotshots are the premier aerial firefighting unit of Canada, comprising [20 CL215/CL415](URL They are primarily based out of CFRH Edmonton and utilize Canadian Forces locations in the Prairie CFAR region. &gt;**The Canadian Aerial Communications Warfare Group:** The Canadian ACWG is the premier Electronic Warfare, Early Warning, SEAD, units, taking part will be the CFAR Pacific Units. &gt;**Strategic Air Group One ""Dark Angels"":** Are one of two premier strategic long-range strike units operated by the Canadian Air Force, and including a variety of strategic bombers. &gt;**Munitions** &gt;&gt;**MUNITIONS USED:** AAM-125(125km air to air/surface missile active secondary SEAD), AAM-52(125km air to air missile active secondary SEAD), SDB II(GBU-53/B)(110km Bomb, 110kg warhead), AGM-158C( Long range anti ship missile). Munitions obviously varying per mission, and we won't use anti-ship missiles on land based targets, obviously. Note the AAM-125 is a dual air-to-air and air-to-surface missile, and as it is carried by all forms of aircraft, including F-35, Mosquito D.2 etc, it can be used to kill SAM locations. The AAM-52 will be used to destroy larger targets (anything larger than a fighter). **OPERATIONAL INFORMATION** &gt;**OPERATIONAL REVIEW:** The Canadian Air Force has been tasked with eliminating the entirety of US Federalist war-waging capabilities in Alaska. Given the previously outlined situation of the US forces, and given the [Dutch deployment](URL won't be helping matters when it relates to supplies, we believe strongly that the US Alaska forces can and will be crippled following a first strike. Orders have been given to eliminate all US Forces capabilities in Alaska, alongside an operation to alleviate the Pacific Republic and it's fight against the Federalists. &gt;**First Strike of the Dark Angels** &gt;&gt;The Strategic Air Group One ""Dark Angels"" will take off from CFB Whitehorse and CFS Prince Rupert and will launch first-strikes against the US Federalists, raining down hail and brimstone. Equipped with previously listed munitions (based on mission), the Dark Angels will destroy crucial targets including but not limited to, &gt;&gt;[**Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson Alaska:**](URL Total Destruction of infrastructure and operational capabilities, destruction of all US Navy/marine dock capabilities, destruction and targeting of American Airfields within the Joint Base (that includes Elmendorf AFB). Focus is also being placed on the total destruction of US Forces Assets based in the area, with specific focus being placed on the destruction of the vast majority of **American-Dutch** equipment and of the bases operational capabilities in both acting as an ECC headquarters and as a potential location for an exiled US Federal government. &gt;&gt;[**Wasalia-Palmer-Anchorage Bridge:**](URL The WPA-Bridge is the only connection that the city of Anchorage has to the greater continent. The destruction of the bridge will prevent any American Forces from escaping. Furthermore the smaller land masses will also be destroyed to prevent an immediate rebuilding of the bridge. Additionally strategic areas of the highway between Anchorage and the Bridge will also be destroyed (remote areas eliminating the risk of civilian casualties). **NOTE THIS IS THE ONLY LOCATION BEING DESTROYED REGARDLESS OF THE SURRENDER NOTICE RESULTS** - this is largely due to the Canadian Forces deeming that a potential breakout of US forces from Anchorage (which most US forces in Alaska had moved to beyond Wainwright) to reinforce the mountains (akin to Afghanistan) would be far to great a risk. &gt;&gt;[**Anchorage-Portage Highway Area:**](URL The Anchorage Portage Highway links the city of Anchorage to the last route that leads to any form of escape, the highway along this remote and uninhabited stretch of road will be destroyed to prevent the mass-use of escape. &gt;&gt;**Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport &amp; Merill Field Airport :** It is presumed and likely that additional airfields and airports will and would be used by Federalist forces to launch counter attacks. Therefore the airstrips of these airfields will also be destroyed in the first strike. &gt;&gt;**Fort Wainwright:** Destruction of airfields and operational capabilities, alongside the targeting of US Soldiers. &gt;&gt;**Eareckson Air Station:** Airfield and operational capabilities (saving the Radar). &gt;&gt;[**Eielson Air Force Base**](URL Destruction of stored aircraft, airfields/runway capabilities. &gt;&gt;**Fairbanks International Airport**: Destruction of the airfield as a basing and operations location for US Federalist forces.

(Primarily striking to prevent it's use/repair following Pacific Strikes) &gt;&gt;**Allen Army Airfield:** Destruction of the airfield as a basing and operations location for US federal forces. &gt;&gt;**Kodiac Air Station and Base:** Destruction of the airfield as a basing and operations location for US federal forces. (Primarily striking to prevent it's use/repair following Pacific Strikes) &gt;&gt;**Ketchikan Navy Range/Base:**Destruction of the airfield as a basing and operations location for US federal forces. (Primarily striking to prevent it's use/repair following Pacific Strikes) &gt;&gt;**Valdez Station:** Destruction of the location as a basing and operations location for US federal forces. &gt;&gt;**Sitka Air Station:** Destruction of the airfield as a basing and operations location for US federal forces. (Primarily striking to prevent it's use/repair following Pacific Strikes) &gt;&gt;**Clear Base (NORAD):** Is not a TARGET &gt;&gt;Secondary targets will be provided as the operation continues, provided by the WARMIND - EDEN in conjunction with Canadian War-time planning officials. &gt;Note: Aircraft will be provided missions based on range, capabilities, and munitions. &gt;**The Wings of Freedom** &gt;&gt;Concurrently with the Dark Angels, the Wings of Freedom alongside their loyal wingmen will begin launching operations from CFRH/CFB Whitehorse, CFBs Comox, Esquimalt, Kelowna, and CFSs Cassiar, Prince Rupert, Winter Harbor, Ulukhaktok, and Eagle Plains (along with other regional CFAR-CFS stations). These forces will work to secure **total air superiority and domination** of the skies enforcing a **no-fly zone** over the entirety of civilized Alaska. Furthermore they will begin mobile harassment and targeting of American equipment on the move to create defenses, and additionally will cover Canadian Army and naval personnel. They will also begin to establish a no-naval entrance zone over the Knik Arm and greater bay utilizing previously listed anti-ship missiles. They will also immediately begin SEAD, EW, and other similar operations (many munitions have secondary SEAD functions) and will attempt to completely disable the American Federalists capability to wage an air campaign, or to receive further supplies. Finally they will defend Canadian airspace and bases from attack. Once air superiority is secured, they will focus on enforcing the no-fly zone, destroying straggling US Federalist forces, and supporting the ground and naval operations. &gt;&gt;Note: Targets remain largely the same, however with more freedom to choose targets as they appear in regards to THAAD and other installations/equipment. Strict adherence to the ROE to minimize civilian casualties is being put in place. &gt;&gt;Note: The Wings of Freedom will be dropping Whaitiri Multi Purpose Drones into the waters (around Anchorage), which can act both as mines and depth charges/anti-mines. Additionally they will be dropping pamphlets (after securing air superiority) to the various non-Canadian controlled cities, that still have American Forces presence (presuming a no-surrender scenario) instructing that if they surrender, food and other resources will flow from the vaults of Canada to support the hurting populace. Note: Should Canadian aircraft somehow fail to make the first strikes, fallback strikes will be initiated hitting the roadways between Anchorage and Fairbanks, Fairbanks and Yukon, and etc. The goal being then to prevent a surge of American forces. (Assuming a no-surrender) &gt;**Soaring Victory** &gt;&gt;Alongside the Wings of Freedom, units from the Soaring Falcons will immediately begin cooperating with American Republic and non-war time deployed Canadian air units to establish a defense of Canada, her bases, and air space. Soaring Victory will also begin initiating an air superiority campaign in support of the Pacific Republic, harassing the limited air power of the US Federalists along the border of the Pacific Republic and American Federalists and will cooperate and interface with American Republic aircraft to avoid any issues. Additionally Soaring Falcon Units utilizing previously listed anti-ship missiles and other munitions will run coastal defense of both Canada and Washington+Oregon+California (whatever is in range). (Operations only on the Pacific/Western Prairies regions of CFAR) &gt;**The Cascades on Fire** &gt;&gt;After Air superiority has been ensured over the remaining Great Plains/Pacific West, units of the Aerial Hotshots will begin attacking and destroying the fires set by Donald Trump. Furthermore they will take proactive steps to soak areas of Canadian forests to prevent spread. -------------- ##[**OPERATION - DAY OF BLACK SUN**](URL *Note: All operations are occurring concurrently* **SITUATION AND INFORMATION** &gt;**Situation:** With news that the US Federalists are attempting to eliminate and destroy the Pacific Republic and American Republic, alongside the building up of forces located **solely** [**within the Anchorage Area**](URL we must begin to break down the fabric of Federalist Forces, uprooting them from their mountain castle and bringing them to their knees. (Assuming US Forces fail to surrender) &gt;**Involved Units** &gt;&gt;**Canadian Cyber-warfare Center:** Located and based in the Vermillion, the Canadian Cyber-warfare Center is the premier cyber-warfare division of the Canadian Forces. &gt;&gt;**EDEN + CONSTRUCTS** &gt;&gt;[**COVERT OPERATIVES (SECRET/CLASSIFIED)**](URL &gt;&gt;**Mobile Task Force 4 ""Black Hats""**: MTF-4 ""Black Hats"" are the special operations cyber force, excelling in hacking and precision decapitation strikes, the MTF-4 expands upon the cyber-warfare capabilities of Canada, which can be seen throughout the specific Cyber-warfare division, within the army, etc. &gt;&gt;**Mobile Task Force 5 ""Smoke""**: MTF-5 is specifically designed to create a smoke-screen for Canadian operations at home an abroad. Another ""digital"" special force, they are capable of operating both in and away from the field during active combat to create ""confusion and disaray"" within Enemy lines and communication networks. Thus providing a major level of security to all precision operations by the Canadian Forces. &gt;&gt;**Mobile Task Force 6 ""Mirrors""**: MTF-6 ""Mirrors"" works in tandem with MTF-5, but has a very different mission objective. The MTF-6's goal is to replicate and mirror the styles and patterns of cyberwarfare of hostile forces. Using Lion_CONSTRUCT analysts and human professionals, they can observe and then replicate hostile cyber-warfare and digital signatures and patterns of enemy forces, conducting operations under these guises. This is especially interesting in that they can mirror attacks back upon the hostile forces, by replicating the same patterns creating disruption within enemy attacks. **OPERATIONAL INFORMATION** &gt;**Operational Review:** As [Defense Plan - Mother (classified)](URL continues to remain in affect, (but presumably is winding down now), the Canadian Cyber-warfare center alongside new units and EDEN will launch a wide-sweeping cyber-warfare and information warfare campaign against the US Federalists in Alaska. (Assuming US Forces fail to surrender) &gt;**Solar Eclipse** &gt;&gt;EDEN and a large number of her constructs (ANT/managed by Spiders, and Dogs) will begin launching a total blackout attack on US Federalist Communication and Networks in Alaska, with the intent to completely inhibit and or outright destroy the Federalist's capability to coordinate a counter-attack of any kind. They will also begin immediately launching a Deepfake attack based on the successes through MOTHER and the American Republic's own operations to begin creating additional confusion within the American Federalists forces. &gt;&gt;Furthermore EDEN in conjunction with the Cyberwarfare Center will launch an information-campaign geared towards the civilians within Alaska who have access to social media, TV, etc, by broadcasting commercials, ads, and social media posts/videos to showcase the Canadian Forces in a positive manner, standing alongside the American Republic to save the citizens from a **genocidal and Trump-Terrorist supporting** Federal Government. &gt;&gt;Emphasis will be placed on the showcasing of US Federal forces supporting Trump and also conducting actions which completely harmed and hurt the American people. The goal being not to lie but to showcase the simple fact that the US Federalists supported a genocidal maniac. [TV Stars from the hit Alaskan TV Show](URL will also be used in spreading the message to rural Alaskans and those who are fans of the show. &gt;&gt;EDEN and the Canadian Cyberwarfare Center will also be utilizing our high-quality satellites (taken from the UCR) to ensure **all operations remain up to date with information**. This includes the Canadian Positioning Satellites, NOVASAR, and others. &gt;&gt;Mobile Task Force 4 ""Black Hats"" who specialize in decapitation strikes, will also launch cyber-warfare attacks against US Federalist Forces in an attempt to decapitate the ECC leadership based out of Alaska. The Black Hats which specialize in hacking and precision decapitation strikes will focus their efforts alongside the broader attacks of EDEN and the Canadian Cyberwarfare Center. &gt;**False Sun** &gt;&gt; Mobile Task Forces 5 and 6 will be utilized in providing confusion among the US Federalist forces. MTF-5 ""Smoke"" will be utilized to create a smoke-screen for Canadian Army and Naval personnel pushing into the Alaskan frontier, preventing US Federalist forces from pinpointing operation areas, objectives, and Canadian forces movements. They as part of the JTF-2 and specializing in this form of warfare, will most likely excel at such operations to create confusion and disarray within the enemy lines of communication, (including social media). Whereas MTF-6 ""Mirrors"" will work in tandem with MTF-5 but with the goal of completely eroding and destroying US Federalist trust in their own communication networks and with each other. By replicating US Federalist communication patterns, styles, and cyber-warfare patterns, we will effectively cripple the US Federalists as they **turn on each other, suspecting one another of being traitors**. This will of course include the need for the MTF-4 Black Hats and MTF-6 to work together in creating social-engineering of the paranoid, underfed, and demoralized American forces. Additionally it will build distrust within the Commanders of important equipment, so that if they receive orders that may destroy the world as we know it, they would consider ignoring the order as they cannot be sure of its verification. -------------- ##[**OPERATION - COLD WATERS**](URL *Note: All operations are occurring concurrently-This operation will begin regardless of Alaskan operations* **SITUATION AND INFORMATION** &gt;**Situation:** With news that the US Federalists are attempting to eliminate and destroy the Pacific Republic and American Republic the Canadian Forces has deemed it important that the threats to our immediate allies and ourselves are eliminated efficiently while minimizing civilian casualties.

Evasion and stealth will become the key to ensuring the safety of the Canadian Pacific Fleet, however with this new and **fully equipped and armed** fleet facing off against a USN that has **almost 0 supplies at this point**, we believe fully that our chances are good. Decy Missiles and Jammer missiles (SEAD as listed in the air-campaign) will be utilized to full effect. Additionally the 1st Canadian Submarine Group will begin working in tandem with the Pacific Republic's own submarine forces in both safeguarding the SSBNs and eliminating USN surface vessels and submarines in the Pacific. Furthermore one of the submarines will safeguard the Army forces assaulting Juneau. &gt;&gt;The secondary objective of the Pacific fleet is maintaining control of the Alaskan Islands (Aleutians) to prevent a hostile takeover of said islands, retaining them strongly within Canadian control. Naval Tactical Operations Group will be tasked with securing the various islands supported by the Canadian Navy as a whole. &gt;**Bottleneck** &gt;&gt;The USN has created itself a bottleneck within the Mediterranean sea. [We are aware that a large number of USN vessels have retreated to the Crete naval base, additionally rumor has it that some submarines also went](URL Therefore the 2nd Canadian Submarine Group will form a hunting party waiting just outside the mouth of the Mediterranean Sea, (and far enough away from Ascension Island (UCR Base and the Gibraltar Base) to ensure that we can fire into the sea and kill anything attempting to flee. Once we fire, we will begin another cat and mouse game in the Atlantic, the USN will be drained of it's supplies slowly but surely. The Canadian Atlantic Fleet will also at this time be remaining in Brazilian bases, which should make it legally difficult to attack, however if we even think a threat may be possible, we will break out into the Atlantic and begin a cat and mouse game. It should be known we are aware of all current **UCR bases** and will be staying well away from range. &gt;&gt;Additionally the Atlantic Fleet will assist in protecting the American Republic's coastline and begin protecting the flow of international goods. While also beginning in preparation for naval-air operations against US - SOUTHERN forces. &gt;**Little Boat** &gt;&gt; Utilizing the 3rd Canadian Patrol Group, we will begin dumping large numbers of Whaitiri Multi-purpose Drones into the waters around Juneau and the Canadian Pacific Islands.

The three members of [**the Squad**](URL slammed PRC interference in the evolving Texan secessionist crisis, which continues to slow the treatment of wounded and infirm patients across the continental United States. The denial of service and ransomware attacks leveraged against US Health Services have left dozens dead in Texan Hospitals, and the number is expected to climb as disruptions continue.

Given the death toll and the fact these attacks have already undermined our national security, the PRC must be condemned for these actions. Omar has explicitly demanded that Washington trigger NATO Article 5 against China, citing the [**NATOs declaration on cyberattacks**](URL as a threat to collective defence. The Congresswoman has also pointed out that a lack of strong response would only reinforce popular sentiments that President Wohl is in bed with China, and has willfully compromised our sovereignty to protect his own personal interests. &gt;Finally, Rashida Tlaib has called on the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Protection and Promotion of Medical Neutrality for the investigation of Chinese cyber-activity, citing the [**Medical Neutrality Protection Act of 2011**](URL as legal basis for these investigations.

3,cyber-crime,worldpowers,[EVENT] Brazil invests in energy,1,dyeizs,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/dyeizs/event_brazil_invests_in_energy/,2019-11-19 14:09:07,"The Bolsonaro family at large has always been interested in alternative forms of energy. Deputy Renan Bolsonaro, also notable for owning a massive PMC, has submitted a large bill to the Chamber of Deputies to see Brazil's energy production increase. First is traditional alternative energy, solar panels. The government of Brazil will fund the creation of a large number of solar panels. One of those solar panels will be placed on an offshore platform, this will test the viability of offshore solar platforms. The offshore platform will be ten miles offshore and thirty meters by thirty meters wide and ten meters above sea level. All equipment on the platform will be water proof to prevent big waves from damaging it. A long cable will connect the offshore platform to the mainland so the power can travel to where it will be used. Alongside the solar panels a weather station will be built on the platform. In Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeio a working class communities that are predominantly home to members of labor unions will also have solar panels built. a number of the houses in these neighborhoods will be bought out through eminent domain, the working class union households will be provided with plenty of compensation to move to one of the communities on the outskirts of the town. This will ensure that the working class union members maintain high labor mobility, economists in the past have found that low labor mobility leads to low growth of labor income, while also providing a test case for renewable energies in our cities. Second, will be some land reform. Currently in Brazil it is hard to know who owns some of the land. We will work to distribute the land, not too those who can't properly work it like many foolish leftist governments do, instead selling off the land to those who can work it most productively. The effect of this will likely see a lot of land in Amazonas, Para, and Mato Grosso consolidated into major logging, mining, energy extraction, and farming companies. Those who are squatting on the newly clarified lands will be assisted in moving to one of Brazil's many cities were they will have better opportunities to make a living. While it isn't an intention of this bill this will likely have the effect of forcing many of the Venezuela sympathetic farmers and natives in Amazonas to move to major cities like Salvador, Brasilia, and other cities further south. In cities the Police Pacifying Unit keeps the peace, unfortunately their is not currently a similar unit for the rural areas of the country, that will be changed. As part of the Agriculture Department we will establish the Land Reform Enforcement Patrol. LREP will be made up of 10,000 officers, all of whom will receive high training in jungle warfare in case radicals commit violent or property crime against the changes in land ownership. This program will greatly increase production of biofuels, petroleum, and food(fuel for people). Third, we will work to create carbon neutral energy source by investing in energy that takes advantage of how the smallest building blocks of matter interact. This energy source isn't new to the world or even new to Brazil but in these new investments into it we will maintain pressure in the place where the reactions take place and use deuterium oxide as the coolant. Facilities of this nature will be built in Salvador, Recife, and Natal and all will have the highest security imaginable. Each facility will have two of the reaction chambers and will provide a lot of power for the nearby states. Any waste materials will be carefully stored in case they can ever be used later and to prevent harm from coming to anyone through exposure to their decay. Fourth, the many Dams of Brazil will be hardened making them less likely to fail and many measures, such as artificial lakes will be created down stream of them so that if they fail the water loses much of it's energy quickly and does no damage to down river settlements. Next, Brazil's power grids will see many more connections between plants and cities built in, establishing a reliable national power grid with many built in redundancies. Wires will be insulated to stop graphite bombs from causing electrical disruptions. Cyber security will be greatly increased preventing cyber attacks from damaging our power grid. This bill is expected to get easy support from the PSL, mixed support from the CDP, and minimal support from the WP."

India is also the largest democracy within the Commonwealth of Nations, yet while they have [actively worked against Communism and Socialism](URL we on our part failed to recognize this fight. The Union State, despite being a former supplier of arms to the Indian government has taken a turn for the worse. Already their arms sales to your nation have all but ceased, leaving India vulnerable diplomatically and militarily. Moreso than this however, is the fact [**they threatened the entire world**](URL with **nuclear war and attack** should they come into conflict not only with the Union State, but **any Union State Ally**. This places India at direct odds against **the Union State** who supports **Pakistan** a nation which is feared to be heavily involved in the [Bangladeshi Crisis](URL which brings unbelievable instability to your nation. Furthermore you now remain at grave threat of attack should the Union State deem your actions against Pakistan or Bangladesh to be perceived as hostile. The Union State no longer respects the rule of law, this has been made clear. Furthermore their dedication to their allies remains at best minimal, as is showcased by them dropping you as an ally the minute Pakistan showed more willingness to kiss the hand of the Union State. With the United States crumbling and long-standing disputes between China, India must find allies. The Union State is not a feasible option for the reasons we have previously listed. This is where the United Commonwealth Realms comes in. ---------------------- **The United Commonwealth Realms** has had a long history with the Indian subcontinent and with the proud nation of India. We have battled together twice in the fields of Europe, and have fought around the world in the name of Honor and Glory. While the Indian relationship with the British Empire was at times tumultuous, India's relationship with the Commonwealth stood fast and strong. India remains today as one of the strongest and proudest members of the Commonwealth of Nations, which represents equality, peace, and unity. The United Commonwealth Realms represents and embodies all of this as we work to bring prosperity, equality, and peace to the world. In [Timor-Leste](URL we have built new hospitals and educational institutions, in [Guyana we are actively fighting crime and **human trafficking**](URL these are but a few instances of the work we do to bring peace to the world. Additionally, the Indian and Commonwealth peoples worked together during the Indonesian crisis, ensuring stability and freedom. We now approach the Indian People, the Indian Nation, the India that we know, to discuss kindling a new relationship, beyond the **friendship and brotherhood** that we already share. We would like to enter into the same agreement that we entered with our allies such as Guatemala, Honduras, and others which includes, * **Economic:** There has been no time more important than now, in which the largest economies of this world must come together and ensure the survival of our economies. The USA in civil war, a **Union State threatening Nuclear War**, and a mess of other crises threatens the world and our economies. India has worked hard to build up its economy, as has the Commonwealth. Combined we control a large share of the world's trade. We would like to begin discussing the possibility of an FTA or Trade Barrier Lowering Agreement, or a limited FTA on select goods. Additionally with the **world oil crisis** continuing, prices skyrocket. The Commonwealth has invested heavily in ensuring it's oil capabilities, and would be willing to export to India at reduced rates so they are no longer scammed by the controlling OPEC. * **Other Goods:** India still produces a large amount of textiles and other such goods, we would like to become one of India's main sources to export such goods. They would be subject to ensure quality control as is standard Indian policy of course. * **Consideration regarding Trade Union:** We would like to invite India to the Commonwealth Trade Union which includes the UCR one of the largest economies in the world. It would see economic cohesion programs put in place to ensure that cultural and policy differences do not impede on trade. It would also allow for port standardization between the Commonwealth and India, for increased trade. It would also continue to ensure the **safety of our economies** as India has few international allies at this point economically. * **Political:** While we offer entrance into the United Commonwealth Realms, we **don't expect a yes at this time**, potentially India could consider a **prospective member position** in which they can observe and interact without committing whatsoever so they can observe the inner-workings. We would also like to consider singing a **Mutual Cooperation Agreement** which would see India support UCR interests and vice versa. It would also allow for a **network of joint-intelligence** as covert operations by opposing nations only continue to increase. With a Union State threatening any nation who comes in their way, it becomes all the more important we work together. * **Military:** The Union State has threatened India, by threatening anyone who would interfere against it's allies. These where not simple threats of conventional means, instead it was **Nuclear Attacks** being threatened. Despite a semi-peace being signed between India and Pakistan, the crisis in Bangladesh/Pakistan continues to stoke flames on the fire, and as seen in the Ukraine, **the Union State is fully willing to nuke even people it calls its own.** We therefore would like you to consider the following, * **Joint Military Training:** As is being conducted, nations from all over the Commonwealth of Nations, United Commonwealth Realms, and other non-commonwealth related allies are training together [in the established Officer Training Program](URL we would like to invite India into this program, to continue building upon India's long-founded professionalism as a military power. This would also provide opportunities for India to interact globally with new found friends and allies. Additionally we would like to begin holding large-scale exercises (paid for by us) which will see massive cooperation with India, these can occur in the Commonwealth and in India. * **Joint Military Cooperation:** For 15 years, India has remained dormant in it's development. It lacks the modern equipment needed on the battlefield, the Union State providing only piecemeal equipment before leaving you to the wolves. We would like to change this, by working towards a revitalization of the Indian military industry and Armed Forces. We currently have a large number of high-end yet reasonably priced equipment which we can produce for the Indian government, and we can completely modernize and **Standardize** India's small arms **free of charge** as we have done with Brazil. This would continue to build on the professionalism of the Indian Army. * **Joint UCR-India Base:** We would be interested in working with India to set up **anti-ICBM and anti-missile** systems, the threats by the **Union State to nuke anyone who threatens them even conventionally** places us all at risk. We as your ally will never **allow you to fall from a hostile and aggressive force** and wish to work with you in constructing a significant defensive system. This would necessitate some bases in India. Additionally we would like to establish a joint Commonwealth-India Cyber-security and Intelligence Task Force. Actions by Pakistan in Bangladesh and actions by the Union State in Ukraine/China in Texas have showcased the devastating effect that cyber-attacks can have. India which lacks proper security systems over it's entire infrastructure which provides necessary daily materials for over a billion people is **extremely vulnerable**. A joint-task force to ensure the security of our nations **and especially the Indian infrastructure** would be most positive. * **Defense Agreement:** Such talks have existed in the past, for such relations. However with a **Union State threatening nuclear war** and the USA **crumbling**, it seems now that more than ever a relationship between our nations of a defense related nature is paramount. The UCR can offer anti-ICBM security systems, anti-air, and anti-naval systems, along with a wide variety of equipment. Signing a defense-agreement in which we would swear to defend each other, would be most suiting for the world climate at this time. ------ **Final Note:** The Indian People cannot stand alone and the Commonwealth does not intend to let that happen. We have proven our loyalty, standing by nations such as Brazil, Guyana, Timor-Leste since the 20s when their various crises had reached boiling points, and we continue to do so now. Should India agree to enter as a **Prospective Member** or agree to become a **Transitional Member** which both lead to becoming a Core Realm, (just starting at different stages), it would open a wide-range of new and life-saving technologies. From AI that can assist and care for elderly and state security, to a Quantum Network that thus far remains unshaken by the world of cyber-terror. All these and more regardless of India's decision lay available, **but an alliance between The United Commonwealth Realms and India** remains vital to **global security, peace, and prosperity**. We Stand By our Allies, as they stood by us in the fields of France, the Rhineland of Germany, in the sands of Egypt and Savannah of South Africa. We hope, India will stand together with us now. And regardless of India's decision, we will remain your loyal friend and ally."

With many governments struggling to contain the spread of addictive substances such as metafent, unofficial reports indicate that the PSA has become involved in the fight. A hacktivist vigilante group called ""Los Sunatras"" (Sufridos por el narcotrfico - suffered from drug trafficking) has been engaged in targeting the cartels in the cybersphere. Seemingly frustrated by the lack of action on the parts of the United Provinces of America and Mexico, Los Sunatras have gone after some of the most notorious organized crime groups in history. Their actions have ranged from cyber espionage, publicizing contacts with other crime organizations and even legitimate officials, and taking down computer systems with methods such as DDoS attacks. Sources familiar with the group's activities and international cyber warfare capabilities have suggested that the group's operational methods resemble those typically associated with Pacifican intelligence, suggesting a tie. Pacific States officials have rejected involvement, denying a request for additional comment. The accusations have been supported by a familiar to mask the source of these attacks, which was initially masked as emanating from the United States but revealed to be from computers in the Pacific States of America; however, the government's role remains unclear. The vigilantes were able to show for limited successes, but only revealed the involvement of minor players in the drug trade. The ""cyber scare"" has led the cartels and other trafficking organizations to double down on security and some have speculated that this could lead to a return to non-digital methods of communication. Still, the panic has caused a not-insignificant disruption for the criminal leaders. It remains to see if Mexican law enforcement will move to arrest the deanonymized collaborators. Were it not for the major cyber offensive on the cartel, harassment of the drug trade in Somalia would not have been attributed to intelligence agencies of the Pacific States. However, the timing has been interpreted as a a coordinated entrance into the drug war. Suspected espionage activity has been uncovered in Somalia, with officials there pointing fingers at several citizens of the Pacific States who they believe to have been acting on behalf of the government. The foreign citizens whose names were not published by the Somalis were accused of monitoring metafent production in the country. The local embassy in Mogadishu has confirmed, however, that no citizens of the Pacific States of America are under arrest in the country. It is suspected that they were investigating ties between Chinese (FRC) and Somali entities involved in the drug trade."

However, the previous association between the government and the group has left some believing that this is a belated cover-up. Logical attempts to ""connect the dots"" have run into one big problem: the Pacific States of America has arguably the best encrypted systems in the world and elite cyber intelligence.

Attacks on the mob in the United States, Yakuza in Japan, and Triads in both the People's Republic of China and Federal Republic of China have emerged into the public sphere. Attributed to Las Sunatras, some have jumped to their own conclusions about who was behind the attacks. The risk was not without reward. While continuing to operate, sources say that the Triads have been unable to coordinate their highly-internationalized operations. Law enforcement following the group say that the Triads have ""gone dark"" for the time being. Several minor players in [The Commission](URL have been revealed publicly thanks to Las Sunatras efforts. Italian criminal organizations are believed to have taken a severe blow to their accounting operations, important as the civil war in that country allowed them to greatly expand their influence. It is unclear what sort of effect the operations had against other groups, with these types of organizations obviously not releasing information to the public. Plausible deniability on the part of the PSA government has minimized greater retaliation. However, in jurisdictions already unfriendly to the advanced North American state, security sources report that operating as normal may be unsafe. The embassy in Chongqing has taken precautions on its own to warn employees about possible provocations from the Triads. The threat to Pacifican citizens in the United States is unclear. In Italy and Japan, friendly relations and the competency of law enforcement mean that even if the criminal organizations attempt to retaliate, diplomats are likely safe. _______ **Pacific States Domestic Situation:** Fearful of other historical examples where American diplomatic missions abroad have been attacked, a discussion has been started in political circles whether Sacramento should take measures to pull back its representatives where they are in danger and if the government's actions have put its officials at risk."
9,cyber-crime,worldpowers,[ROLEPLAY] See The Bright Side,4,bjkymg,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/bjkymg/roleplay_see_the_bright_side/,2019-05-02 04:55:15,"# [Le Devoir](URL ## In Face of Political &amp; Economic Instability: Qubcois Choose to be Happy La LaRue *** As the American-Canadian war flared further with info about Canadian strategies given to the public, and tensions rise between Quebecs closest allies, Quebecs people see the bright side. A sense, a stigma of optimism has infected Quebecs popular culture. This tone began when Quebec discovered Canadas experimentation with nuclear weapons and rose to notoriety in the past years. This large optimism is in Quebecs music, Quebecs already popular pop and rap artists no longer sing of a struggle or heartbreak, but enjoying what life gives you. A new pop band has also spurred, their sounds echo off of Kero Kero Bonito and sunshine pop, called Harmonie(stylized hArmoni3) The group sings exclusively in French and blend synth beats, nostalgic video game sound effects, and positive messages. Harmonie sings about the beauty of nature in Tournesol; the joy of daydreaming in Esprit; and the satisfaction of listening to music you love in Sons uniques. Another artist has spurred, the acoustic musician of Claire Dubois. Claire unlike Harmonie chooses to use the sound of a soft guitar to ignite confidence. She still gives off a small time musician vibe even after making it to stardom. She sings not about the small things in life but to inspire the listener to take charge in their life, and spark confidence. While rap has had its fair share of optimistic songs, and albums there has yet, or yet to be a well-known rap artist dedicated to this kind of music. While rap has been known to show its singers take of societal issues including racial prejudices, crime, and breaking other societal bounds, Qubcois rappers show their soft side. The up and coming rapper Enzo Allemand has blended bubblegum and happy beats with his deep, overbearing voice. Allemand uses rap not to tell his listeners about the problems faced by many Quebecois, but to tell them how to fix these problems. Music is not the only thing that has changed during this optimist revolution fashion has changed to become simplistic. Quebecs largest fashion designers have been inspired by 1940s fashion, especially female fashion. The 1940s frock has returned with a simplistic pastel palette of soft pinks and dainty yellows. Fashion has overall gotten simpler with patterns being replaced with flat colors and at most three materials in a piece. The Peter Pan collar has made a return, with tabloids saying the dress of the season is a pastel pink frock, with no belt and a white Peter Pan collar. Mini skirts have practically disappeared from Quebecois fashion, being replaced by lower thigh height, just above the knees or under mid-thigh. Male fashion has gotten more formal, with eggshell white and pastel colors dominating male shorts and polos. Large jackets dominate winter clothing with their baby blues blending into the temperature. Formal clothing has gone the same way with men trading in their deep navy blue and black suits with light greens and blues. Womans clothing has mostly stayed the same but more simple with more woman choosing to accessorize with a belt rather than have a detailed, complex dress. Quebecs most popular social media site Clique has also changed dramatically, the entire cyber-ambiance has been given a dose of dopamine. Cloques Story of the Day feature, which used to highlight important political and economic news from around the globe, is now cluttered with feel-good stories. Quebecois advertisers have used Buzzwords to play into this development. Words like joy, happiness, family, and motivate, are used by countless advertisers to attract these customers. Quebec has not undergone a massive political, nor economic change, but a cultural one. A culture of soft pastel outfits, and positive posts running rampant within social media sites. To create a sense of safety from political and economic instability Qubcois have chosen to see the bright side."

From an undisclosed location in Eastern Europe, the massive cybercriminal organization has conducted a campaign of terror-for-hire across the world. No target has been off-limits, from the classified databases of intelligence agencies, to encrypted military communications, to the most secure bank vaults. However, there is an inherent risk in their operations. The 404 Force, if discovered, could be nearly wiped out if its fortified compound was raided and taken over by the authorities. Nobody's come close to pinning down their location yet, but some day they will. Therefore, more branches are needed - both as ways to increase the size of the organization, and provide backup headquarters and teams in case the leading one goes down. Two targets have been identified as useful for this, in locations with significant access to the critical digital infrastructures needed to carry out these operations: The Netherlands, and Italy. ###The Penose More ecstasy is exported by Dutch criminal organizations than any other in the world, with these same organizations leading Europe in the cocaine and cannabis markets. The *Penose* already have a history of cooperation with other foreign criminal organizations, with their extensive links to British drug syndicates and Colombian cartels in the exportation of cocaine and ecstasy, and then Moroccan and Pashtun drug lords for hashish. The 404 Force has noted the recent [rise of illegal operations in the Bijlmer areas](URL - they would be interested in setting up shop, taking over one of these large buildings and converting it into a center of cyber operations across the world, stationing a large amount of our staff in it. In exchange for Penose protection, we'd conduct some fundraising operations for your organization in the form of bank raids. We'd also hack and destroy police files incriminating your organization, in order to delay criminal investigations. ###'Ndrangheta With operations in dozens of countries worldwide, and a high-profile defeat of the Sicilian Mafia in the late 1990's/early 2000's that cemented its status as the premier Italian crime organization, 'Ndrangheta unquestionably leads the pack when it comes to the criminal underworld of Europe. No other organization possesses the kind of resources, experience, and power that 'Ndrangheta has. From your base in Calabria, you have overseen a truly impressive rise to power. We respect power when we see it. The 404 Force would be highly interested in establishing a base in Calabria, where in exchange for full 'Ndrangheta protection from authorities, it would conduct continued cyber operations and fund-raise for 'Ndrangheta by raiding banks' digital vaults. We'd also work with 'Ndrangheta to hinder international criminal investigations into your organization by destroying digital legal records."
11,cyber-crime,worldpowers,[EVENT] Masdar II District in Al Dammam,1,7tg82k,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/7tg82k/event_masdar_ii_district_in_al_dammam/,2018-01-28 09:46:57,"**Al-Dammam**[-](URL In the interest of sustainable development and diversification from oil, the Municipal Government of Al-Dammam along with the Provincial and Federal governments have agreed to give the green light to the Masdar II project. This project is expected to bring in additional income from tourism, while improving upon efforts to move towards green energy. *The Project* The $30 Billion dollar project will over an 8 year project create a 10 km^2 district filled with high rises and shopping malls that will turn Al Dammam into a Jewel in the Arabian Gulf. The district will be powered primarily by solar power as well as by the nuclear plants currently being built by the Columbians. The objective would be to allow this city to run on purely clean energy as well as improve upon the aging infrastructure in the City of Dammam. The funding for this city will come primarily from individual investors but also from the city's large oil wealth fund. *Transportation Infrastructure* The City of Dammam will receive a new metro system that will connect all relevant districts and will greatly improve the inter-connectivity. The trains themselves will be electrical to allow for it to be powered by alternate energy. The objective is for the trains to eventually reach a point where it runs on 100% solar energy. In the Masdar II district, greater attention will be given to sustainability with regards to the vehicles that can be used there. Much like Masdar City in Abu Dhabi, vehicles from the outside will be forbidden from entering and 100% clean and automated [PRT Pods](URL will be used for transportation within the city. Furthermore, all roads in the city will feature bicycle lanes to allow for ease of access. There will also be bicycle storage units placed at the entrance of the city as well as in each office building to further encourage cyclists. *High Rises and Shopping Centres* Masdar II will feature several high rise buildings to increase the prestige of Al-Dammam as well as to conserve space. All high rises will have to achieve at least Silver LEEDs Certification to ensure that they are environmentally friendly. Special emphasis will be made on green spaces that will help reduce the city's carbon footprint, particularly green roofs. Due to the desert climate, several buildings will utilize protective skin systems of glass elements that automatically open and close depending on the intensity of sunlight such as those used in the [Al Bahr](URL [Towers] (URL Furthermore, the district will also feature a medium sized mall with a surface area of 28,000 m^2 which will allow for goods and services to be provided to the inhabitants of the new district as well as making it a potential shopping destination. Finally, the district will also contain a new hospital and several schools allowing it to sustain itself. The High rises themselves will be 40% residential and 60% office space and will hopefully attract numerous foreign companies, particularly Korean companies looking to invest abroad to move their funds away from Korea to avoid it from being nationalized. It is believed that numerous companies will choose to set up their regional headquarters in this high tech, environmentally friendly city. *Security* A city such as this will be a target for any foreign funded terrorists or cyberterrorists. It is for that reason that the UKA Armed Forces' Cyber-security units will work hard to develop a secure system to prevent a hacker from creating chaos. Furthermore, dense areas in the city will feature intelligent metal and bomb detectors to prevent an attack from devastating the city. Cameras will also be installed around the city to monitor it for crime. This will be supplemented by [robots that will patrol the city](URL to ensure compliance with the law and also to assist tourists with finding directions. Any infractions will be reported to the local police department. The district shall also feature its own firehall with state of the art [jetpacks similar to those used in Dubai](URL that will be used to fight fire in high and difficult to reach places. *Energy Concerns* The city itself will be powered primarily by a new solar plant located in the nearby desert, with the difference being made up for by several nuclear plants located along the coast. The new solar plant with a combined output of 400 MW shall be contracted to Indian companies and shall cost $3b, capitalizing on India's growing solar panel industry that has allowed for drastic reductions in the cost of production. With this in mind, it is hoped that the city will be fully sustainable and will help us move away from our reliance on petroleum."

As such, the **DIS**, with approval from the high minister and all the lower ministers, has created a new subsection of its command, called the **Internal Peace Keepers** The **IPK** will work in two groups, one called the physical force and one called the media force. The **Physical force** will contain 1,000 agents, who will work to ensure that no one is too rowdy on the streets. As such, they will have jurisdiction over any person seen to be an 'enemy of the confederation' and will work to ensure they are taken care of. For now, this will not include assassinations. Dressed as ordinary police officers, should they find a person who is determined to be an 'enemy of the confederation' they will gain a forged arrest warrant for a perceived crime this person has committed. All forged arrest warrants will have legitimate signatures and will contain believable crimes which will allow these people to be arrested and then sent to jail. The Physical Force will also montior those who are of suspicion but not truly a problem yet. Meanwhile, the **Media Force**, containing 500 people, will work to ensure all forms of internal media do not show much criticism of the Confederacy. They will be allowed to bribe media officials, be they TV, Newspaper or Radio, to ensure their loyalty to the Confederacy, though threats will also be used if the need arises. At the same time the Media force will work with the **Cyber-forces** of the DIS to take down or slow sites found to be critical of Danubia and based within Danubia. Should the IPK be found out, the official comment given will be that the DIS is simply working to protect the Confederacy and the new IPK is simply there to ensure the safety of the people by fighting off those who are seen as dangerous individuals within the Confederacy. Any allegations of the exact nature of the Physical and Media force will be blown off as Conspriracy and the individuals who have stated these things monitored closely. Overall, the IPK will be given a budget of 500 mil per year and will consist of 1500 individuals, with the amounts specified above given to each force."

With funding and expertise from the UKA, three forces shall be trained: * The Republic of Yemen Armed Forces * Regional Yemeni Police Forces * Yemeni Paramilitary Force [UKA and Yemeni government involvement is secret] **Republic of Yemen Armed Forces** The Yemeni Armed Forces established in 1990 acted as the main defense force of the nation. After more than ten years of war, its current capabilities are significantly diminished and it currently possesses roughly 43,500 men, a significant number down from its 2012 numbers at 65,000. [As it stands, the Yemeni people still seem to have a greater loyalty to their tribe than to their nation. It is for this reason that high ranking members of the Yemeni Armed Forces shall be mostly selected from members of the current president's tribe and allied tribes]. The UKA shall provide the Yemeni Armed Forces with training, expertise, and new equipment. It shall also assist with recruitment and performing background checks on individuals to ensure they are not loyal to the Saleh regime or are ex-Houthis. [Shias will not be granted high ranking positions and shall be purposefully mixed with mostly Sunni troops to prevent a coup or mass defections from happening again.](Secret) Yemen currently has an available manpower of 8 million, therefore it can be expected that up to 100,000 men may be qualified and will join the armed forces if recruitment goes well. This number is expected to be reached in anywhere between 3 and 6 years. The UKA Armed Forces are now well experienced and drilled in the art of counterinsurgency and counter-terrorism warfare and shall train the Yemeni armed forces in these fields. The UKA shall also provide equipment to the Yemeni armed forces that rely on older soviet equipment. The newest tank in the Yemeni army's inventory is the T-80 which is from the 70s. This is not acceptable. Until the UKA begins to produce its EDIC Saladin tanks, the UKA will transfer 300 M1A2S tanks to the Yemeni armed forces inventory and shall contact the United States to procure additional equipment destined for the Yemenis including modern standardized small arms such as the M16, M4, etc., 200 M113s and two f-16 aircraft squadrons *16 aircraft total). Although small, this will allow the Yemeni Armed Forces to gain an edge over Iranian backed militias and jihadist groups. We would also like to request assistance from the U.S in training this new force in maintaining regional stability. Finally, the UKA and Yemen have agreed to establish two small permanent UKA base on the outskirts of Aden and the outskirts of Ibb which shall each feature 2 MIM-Patriot batteries manned by UKA to protect Yemeni airspace from potential threats. A small naval presence will be maintained in the port of Mocha to guard the Yemeni coast from pirates and other potential terrorists. However, since the war is not yet over and AQAP is yet to be defeated, the temporary bases in the nation shall remain until further notice. **Yemeni Police Forces** The Emirati police are known to be one of the most effective police forces in the world with incredible response time and expertise in the fields of cyber security and counter-terrorism. The UKA shall assist Yemen with creating strong police forces across the nation to combat the growing threat of terrorism as well as maintain law and order in a country that knew chaos for so long. The goal is to ensure that laws can indeed be enforced and arms will no longer be smuggled into the nation. This force will be established with the following goal: * To ensure state and governorate law prevails over tribal laws * To protect the public from extremists * To prevent hostile factions from arming themselves * To maintain law and order in the nation * To prevent hostile factions from smuggling in personnel, arms, or illicit substances * To monitor the cyberspace for potential threats A separate border patrol force will be established with elements of the UKA security apparatus to ensure this. Furthermore, the police force, being regional, will be able to establish connections with local communities to fight crime and make the nation safer in general. It will also intervene to stop extrajudicial punishments stemming from extremism. **Yemeni Paramilitary Force/National Guard** (Involvement and Sunni-Dominance Secret) The Yemeni crisis was sparked when individuals loyal to the ex-president's tribe rose up and assisted the Shia minority in starting an armed revolt. With the revolt crushed, it is time to ensure that such a conflict never happens again. The UKA will secretly begin funding a paramilitary force which will act as a tribal defense force with the purpose of safeguarding and protecting the current government. This force will join the National Guard and will act as a counter to potential coups in the nation, much like the SANG in Saudi Arabia. However, what will not be made public is that the national guard will be composed solely or overwhelmingly of Sunni members loyal to certain tribes to ensure that it is impossible for them to go through with a coup. The UKA will provide the National Guard with older equipment available and training via proxies. The objective is to have a tribal militia of 71,000 men, roughly the same amount as Yemen had pre-war. We expect to reach these numbers within 3 years of recruiting citing unemployment pressuring people to join the National Guard."

IT TOOK DEDICATION BUT I AM DEDICATED TO MY ART ALWAYS. JUST GLAD I DIDNT ACTUALLY START TO BELIEVE ANY OF THE CRAP I WAS SPEWING. The Bookhouse Boys, as they were now surely known, stood there in amazement at the betrayal they had just witnessed. **MATRIZIANO:** So *you* were the guy on the inside all along! What about Mandela, surely he was in on it, too? **LYNCH:** OH, NO, MISS, IM AFRAID THE MADIBA IS AN ARDENT LE FOLL SUPPORTER AT HEART. REAL SHAME ABOUT THAT GUY, I WAS STARTING TO LIKE HIM A GREAT DEAL. I WONDER WHERE HE IS NOW? That question would never be answered. Laurent Le Foll, bloodied and and half-crippled, had managed to crawl to the edge of the edge of the stage while the 1789 Club were standing around in awe of Lynchs complete domination of Le Foll. Instead of falling off the stage into the baying crowd, Le Foll collapsed into the arms of his co-President, Camille Lemoine, who rapidly carried Le Foll into the back of a Security Brigade van which had been on stand-by in case that either President had to make a hasty retreat. **KONSTANTIN:** Shit! We let that great big dickhead get away! We almost had him, there! **ARTYOM:** I blame Nelson Mandela for this, personally. **LYNCH:** HE MIGHT NOT BE HERE, BUT HE CERTAINLY HASNT GOTTEN AWAY. LE FOLL WILL SURELY BE HEADING TO THE ELYSEE PALACE NOW. As the group debated the reasons behind Le Folls escape, a [curious thing](URL happened, unnoticed by any of the People's National Liberation Army Navy save for Pierre Soult. A glowing yellow light came from the body of Mandingo Chuck, the fallen Supreme Pontiff, and floated, like wisps of smoke on the wind, over to Soult. As he inhaled the energy, Soult instantly felt reinvigorated and stronger than he had done in many decades. **SOULT:** To the Elysee, then, quickly! **KONSTANTIN:** You heard the man, lets fucking go, then! We have some unsettled business with Le Foll! **ARTYOM:** You know, I think Ill hang back a while. Dont worry thought, Ill catch up to you in a bit, if you guys dont mind. **KONSTANTIN:** Are you fucking joking? Of course we mind! I mean, realistically speaking, this is *it.* I dont see Le Foll getting away again, thats just bad writing! Do you really want to have to tell people sat out the final boss fight like some sort of I dont even know. **ARTYOM:** Theres just something I have to do, man, trust me. I dont think Ill have another chance at this if I dont do it right here, right now. **KONSTANTIN:** Well, alright, if you insist, but just know Im not telling them to save any goons for you beat up when you show up late! **ARTYOM:** Well, good buddy, thats a risk Im willing to take if it means I get to finally accept something that was bestowed upon me long ago. Artyom said this as he stared out at the still-gathered crowd of people who had been forced to endure several hours of Le Folls self-aggrandizing rock opera with a rather queer grin on his face. By this point, the residents of Paris were so demoralized and beaten down they probably could have sat through another hour of two blue whales raping each other. **ARTYOM:** Ladies and gentlemen, say hello to your next president As Artyom Atomic Antonovich prepared to give his inaugural address to the people of the Geneva Convention, the rest of the National Peoples Gang hurriedly left the stadium and stepped out into the nearly-deserted streets of Paris. **SOULT:** I never actually considered the logistics of *how* we would get to the Elysee. Suddenly, a high-tech supercar limousine pulled up beside the Diamond Dogs. The driver got out of the side, and motioned for them to enter. **MATRIZIANO:** Modern convenience! **SOULT:** Just who are you, boy? **DRIVER:** Philippe, sir. I work for the Dassault-Leonardo group, Mr. Dassault told me to come pick you guys up, he said you might need a lift to the Elysee Palace? **SOULT:** Well, Ill be fucked, thats the most Napoleons contributed thus far. I must say Im impressed! The five-man-band (including Artyom, who had by now rejoined the team) hurriedly entered the glorified taxi service, and sped off to the Elysee Palace, where they arrived not ten minutes later. Already outside the Elysee were several dozen mercenaries, as well as Napoleon Dassault and Cyrano Anastos, who were clutching large cardboard boxes. **DASSAULT:** Enjoy the ride? Dassault-Leonardos trying our hand at tapping into the growing ride sharing market, as you can tell. Step aside, Uber, this town isnt big enough for the two of us! **SOULT:** You couldnt get anyone to share a ride with you if you roofied them, Napoleon. No matter, though, how shall we proceed with this? I suppose you want to do something involving these hired guns? **DASSAULT:** Oh, these guys? Dont tell anyone, but theyre uh, theyre just here to get shot and beaten in lieu of us when we go up against Le Foll. **SOULT:** Le Foll wont be beating anyone today, I think, not after what our friend here did to him. **LYNCH:** YEAH I TOOK CARE OF THAT PROBLEM, SO YOU DONT HAVE TO USE THESE FINE FELLAS AS HUMAN SHIELDS ANYMORE. At this, several of the mercenaries turned around and muttered amongst themselves, realising that they were just there to die. **DASSAULT:** Ignore this madman! Youre here to win! **ANASTOS:** Win bigly! Tremendous wins, folks! **DASSAULT:** Yes, what he said! Rally the troops, my loyal friends! Half of the mercenary taskforce, the half that could actually understand French, however, were long gone by now, having overpowered a random taxi driver heading away from Le Foll's concert. The rest of them, a motley bunch of Chechens and Ugandans with several charges of war crimes between them, stood at the ready. **SOULT:** For some reason, Im not sure that sending a 30-something-strong bunch of foreign mercenaries into the Elysee in the middle of broad daylight to the kill the president, no matter how horrid and fascist he may be, is the best move, considering the effect it may have on our overall popularity. **KONSTANTIN:** Hold on, are you not the guy who just sneak-attacked that same President live on TV, and then got completely brutalised by him for half an hour? **ARTYOM:** I think he is, buddy! I think he's that guy! Or was that Dassault? I dont know anymore. **MATRIZIANO:** As much as it pains me to say it, I think Konstantins right. I think were a little past caring about public opinion polls at this point. **SOULT:** Sure, you might think that, but itll be a different story when your approval ratings crash to 3%! Thats Hollande territory! **DASSAULT:** Dont besmirch Hollandes name! He died saving hundreds of people in the Toulouse Chocolate Landslide of 2043! Hes a hero! 3%?! More like 300%! **ANASTOS:** Sad! Heroic Hollande is the greatest man of the 21st century, folks! **ARTYOM:** I dont know, I think Karl was a pretty swell guy. Karls the greatest man of the 21st century, and also the greatest martyr. **SOULT:** Karl? Karl who? Karl Marx? **ARTYOM:** No...Karl! Like, Karl Karl! Karl with a K, Karl - Before Artyom could finish his incredibly poor explanation of who Karl was, the mercenary war criminals had moved into the Elysee Palace, and were busy clearing the first floor of any random Security Brigade gimps that were trying to defend the rule of Laurent Le Foll, and also presumably loot the French Presidential Palace for any valuable jewels and gems that might go down well back in their impoverished home countries. **KONSTANTIN:** Theyre taking an awful long time in there. You think they ran into any trouble? **DASSAULT:** That or theyre trying to figure out how to get Piaro Doots *Moonlight Desire* to fit through a door frame. The Chechens and Ugandans arent prided on their intellect, you see. **SOULT:** Perhaps our foreign friends could use some help in there, then? **LYNCH:** I THINK SO. MAYBE WE COULD GIVE THEM A HAND. **DASSAULT:** Someone must tell me, sometime, how this senile loon got involved in our third assassination attempt. **SOULT:** Unless were trying to wait for Le Foll to bleed out, I think that weve stood around here long enough. Whats in the boxes? **DASSAULT:** Oh, these? Its a surprise for our dear friend Laurent. As you say, onwards and upwards! The George W Bush 2000 Transition Team, as they had come to be known in recent hours, continued on into the halls of the Elysee, which had been stripped of most of their artwork and furnishings and were littered with the corpses of various Security gimps and the occasional Ugandan. **KONSTANTIN:** Say what you will about their view on human rights, but damnit if those Chechens arent good at what they do! **ARTYOM:** You can say that again, good buddy! I wish I was born a Chechen! Allahu Akbar indeed! **KONSTANTIN:** I thought you were over that Islam stuff? **ARTYOM:** Oh, huh, yeah. I guess it was just a reflex. **DASSAULT:** Something feels off about this all. Why cant we hear any gunfire? **SOULT:** Unless our friends decided to run off with their newfound riches **ARTYOM:** I take it back, I take it all fucking back, I hate Chechens! Scum, cockroaches, bastards!! **KONSTANTIN:** If the mercs ran off, shouldnt there still be some security fags left for us to rough up? After a few more minutes of this, the Dead Poets Society decided to press on with their mission before stopping once again at a large set of wooden doors. **SOULT:** Well, this is it, the grand hall. If Le Foll and co. are hiding out anywhere in this place, its in here. **MATRIZIANO:** Shall we? Not quite sure what to expect, the Lords Resistance Army walked into the grand hall, a spacious chamber with multiple entry points and a large, stained-glass window to the courtyard outside. It was there that they were greeted by a severely crippled Le Foll and Camille Lemoine, who appeared to be alone. At the sight of the two fascist dickheads, the group drew their weapons. **LEMOINE:** Well, it appears you have ol Laurent and me surrounded. So, what are you to do with us, then? **KONSTANTIN:** Oh, Ive got some ideas! **SOULT:** No, fuck this, this is way too easy. I dont know what sort of tricks you have up your sleeve, Camille, but I dont particularly like whatever queer situation youve dreamed up! **LEMOINE:** Tricks? Oh, youve always been such a paranoiac, Pierre. Cant you just accept the fact that youve bested us? **LYNCH:** SOMETHING TELLS ME HE ISNT TELLING THE TRUTH. **DASSAULT:** Yes, Im getting that impression, too **LEMOINE:** Oh, Im afraid hes right. MPs, lets make an example of these globalist stooges! **LE FOLL:** Holy shit, someone end my suffering! As Lemoine reveled in his own queer villainy, the entire Genevois parliament emerged from the shadows. It was clear from their blank, almost robotic expressions that they were under the control of Genevas Big Brother-esque, crime-fighting AI, Arcangelo, that had ironically been commissioned during the late Thomas Bangalters rule. **KONSTANTIN:** Im not sure we have enough bullets between us to take down this many of them. **SOULT:** I dont even want to imagine the polls after word of this gets out! **MATRIZIANO:** Forget the polls for one second and tell me how the fuck were going to get out of this alive! The rapidly-advancing horde of mind-controlled politicians formed a tightening circle around the Order of the Phoenix, who struggled to think of a way out of this predicament. **DASSAULT:** Vietminh, stand at the ready! The great mass of former National Directory Deputies, Senators, and other-such men of import surged towards the Harlem Hellfighters, who braced themselves for further combat. One of the MPs, Philippe Durand, the representative of Calais East, lunged towards the Dynamic Duo, however Artyom dispatched him with a shot to the head. This appeared to be the starting bell signalling for the rest of the MPs to begin attacking their foes, however before any such grisly gang-bang could occur, a rotund figure on a motorbike crashed through one of the colossal windows surrounding the hall, bringing the action to a halt. **LEMOINE:** Who the fuck **KONSTANTIN:** RAJESH, BABY! Rajesh, a sepoy handy-man and the best friend of the Dynamic Duo, had somehow rode to their aid. The vastly overweight Bombay bad-boy was dressed like Meat Loafs character from the Rocky Horror Picture Show, Eddie, and had a saxophone slung over his back. **LE FOLL:** Camille! The...darkie...has somehow figured out the secrets of Arcangelo! He knows that the politicians are compelled to act out scenes from Rocky Horror! I had it installed for a laugh! **RAJESH:** I didnt, but thanks man. Rajesh hammered on his motorbike, causing the onboard radio to begin playing a [backing-track](URL **RAJESH:** Whatever happened to Saturday Night, when you dressed up sharp and you felt alright? It dont seem the same since cosmic light came into my life, I thought I was divine.. Just then, one of the female MPs, apparently having been broken free from Arcangelos mind-control by the musky power of rock n roll, burst out from the crowd and threw herself around Rajesh, fulfilling the role of Colombia in the original screenplay. **RAJESH:** I used to drive around a chick whod go, listen to the music on the radio. A saxophone was blowing on a rock n roll show...you climbed in the backseat, really had a good time!! Between each line from the song, the morbidly-obese Indian would dispatch several MPs with his saxophone, which doubled as some sort of elephant gun. While singing, Rajesh would perform with a powerful rock n roll vocal which rivalled that of Laurent Le Foll, displaying a previously unknown talent for tunes. **RAJESH:** Hot Patootie, Bless My Soul! I really love that Rock and Roll! Rajesh began to dry-hump the random chick that had charged out towards him, before the brainwashed Republican and Socialist-Democrat MPs, who were getting slaughtered by the Indian, joined in with him. **ALL:** HOT PATOOTIE, BLESS MY SOUL! I REALLY LOVE THAT ROCK AND ROLL!, HOT PATOOTIE, BLESS MY SOUL! I REALLY LOVE THAT ROCK AND ROLL! HOT PATOOTIE, BLESS MY SOUL, I REALLY LOVE THAT ROCK AND ROLL! Rajesh then unleashed an almighty sax solo, causing many of the MPs to have fatal heart-attacks due to its power. **RAJESH:** My head used to swim from the perfume I smelt, my hands kinda fumbled with her white plastic belt, I'd taste her baby pink lipstick and that's when I'd melt...she'd whisper in my ear tonight she really was mine. Rajesh then stalked up to Pierre Soult and Alessandra Matriziano, gazing upon them with the fatherly benevolence of a God. **RAJESH:** Get back in front put some hair-oil on, Buddy Holly was singing his very last song, with your arms around you girl you try to sing along. You felt pretty good, really had a good time! **ALL:** HOT PATOOTIE, BLESS MY SOUL! I REALLY LOVE THAT ROCK AND ROLL! HOT PATOOTIE, BLESS MY SOUL, I REALLY LOVE THAT ROCK AND ROLL! Rajesh then leapt back onto his motorbike, displaying awe-inspiring agility for a man of his size, and sped off towards Laurent Le Foll and Camille Lemoine. **LE FOLL:** Holy shit, the seppos coming for us! Run, Camille! Carry me to safety! He has power! **LEMOINE:** I told you doing the Time Warp was a bad idea, Laurent! I told you that opening *that* door was a bad idea! We didnt know the power we were trifling with, what wed loosed on the world! **RAJESH:** HOT PATOOTIE! **ALL:** HOT PATOOTIE, BLESS MY SOUL! **RAJESH:** BLESS MY SOUL! **ALL:** HOT PATOOTIE, BLESS MY SOUL! **RAJESH:** HOT PATOOTIE! **ALL:** HOT PATOOTIE, BLESS MY SOUL! **RAJESH:** I REALLY LOVE THAT ROCK AND ROLL! With Rajesh as some kind of hell-hound coming for their souls, Lemoine and Le Foll (being supported by Lemoine) sped off into the distance, Rajesh harrying them all the while. Eventually, they escaped his grasp (by going up a flight of stairs) and the new-age Maharaja returned to a stunned British East India Company. **KONSTANTIN:** Good god, Rajesh, that was actually the greatest thing Ive ever seen! Just because of that, Im going to name my first born after you. Of course, hell grow up with much better hygiene and hopefully not develop such poor eating habits, but hell carry the torch for you, buddy! Ive got to ask though, howd you know we were in trouble? **RAJESH:** Its a funny thing, you see. An old friend of mine rang and told me some cool cats in Paris could use a hand. **KONSTANTIN:** How did you know to do Rocky Horror, then? **RAJESH:** Buddy, you rang me like...six hours ago, and told me Le Foll made you do the Time Warp, I wanted to be prepared in case he captured me and I had to do it as well. Do you not remember this? **KONSTANTIN:** Its been a long night. **ANASTOS:** Pathetic Le Foll running at the first sign of trouble, sad! **LYNCH:** I DONT THINK WE SHOULD LET LE FOLL GET AWAY AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP RINSESH. **KONSTANTIN:** I dont suppose you want to tag along with us and finish Le Foll off once and for all? **RAJESH:** You know me, Id love to, but I think this lovely lady and I are going for a joyride on my HOG. I wish you all luck, though, and if it gets to be too much, dont hesitate to give me a call. Maria, lets ride! Rajesh rode off into the distance. **SOULT:** Hes a fucking hog! I cant fathom the size of that bastard! **KONSTANTIN:** I love you, you big, repulsive bastard **MATRIZIANO:** Le Foll is probably getting away right fucking now! **KONSTANTIN:** Yes, but I imagine hes probably pure shaken after that whole ordeal. **MATRIZIANO:** I dont care to talk to you. The Matterhorn Appreciation Society took off after Le Foll and Lemoine, who had last been seen heading up the stairs to the Big Circle, that famed room that Marine Le Pen had installed simply to say that she had created one. In the center of the dark room was a boxy, vintage television set that seemed rather out of place in the late 2050s. **SOULT:** Where on earth are they at? I swear to God, if Le Folls escaped, I will personally whip that Rajesh creature to death! **KONSTANTIN:** Hey, dont throw Rajesh under the bus like that; I dont know if you remember that far back in time, but he kind of saved our collective ass back there! **SOULT:** My apologies, perhaps I should show a little bit more gratitude to our brown-skinned saviour for all hes done for us. **DASSAULT:** I dont remember this TV being here before. Le Foll and Lemoine are probably trying to leave some queer message for us.or, it could be a trap. Say, Artyom, why dont you go over there and turn that TV on? I bet that would be fun. **ARTYOM:** Sure thing, pa- oh, wait a second, I know what youre doing here, you sly dog, you. You want old Artyom to be the hamster in your little experiment. **DASSAULT:** I think the term youre looking for is guinea pig, but aside from that, yes, Id say thats pretty accurate. **ARTYOM:** Cool beans. Thinking he had (somehow) just bested Napoleon Dassault, Artyom swaggered over to the TV and pressed the on button. Seeing that he hadnt died, the rest of the Lance Armstrong Doping Agency made their way over and huddled around the television, where a large amount of static was obscuring the picture. **ANASTOS:** Pathetic Le Foll schlonged by opposition again. Awful signal, just awful. Suddenly the screen burst into GLORIOUS TECHNICOLOR, and the viewers were treated to a [video](URL of Laurent Le Foll and Camille Lemoine, clearly recorded just minutes beforehand, which made them long for the static to return. They stood there dumbfounded for the duration of the video, mouths agape at the queerness they were witnessing. This situation continued for at least five minutes following the end of the video, until Napoleon Dassault broke the ice. **DASSAULT:** I just cant believe nobody in this country of over blank millions noticed how fucking similar to Mick Jagger that gimp Lemoine looks! I mean, I suppose its because hes a fairly irrelevant figure and Mick Jaggers been dead for decades, but its jarring nonetheless! **SOULT:** And is it just me, or does Le Foll look just like Bowie? **KONSTANTIN:** Thats because he is Bowie! Ronald Reagan told us that, and then this magical Irish dude confirmed it. **SOULT:** Ronald Reagan and a magical Irishman. But of course, Konstantin, but of course. **MATRIZIANO:** What are we to make of this incredibly shit performance, anyway? **SOULT:** I think we can extrapolate that Le Foll and Lemoine are gay together? **MATRIZIANO:** Well, that much has been clear to us from the beginning. But why this video, and what are they trying to tell us? **KONSTANTIN:** Hes going to Rome. **DASSAULT:** Yeah, Im sure you can tell that and all. **ANASOS:** Stupid! **SOULT:** You know, Konstantin, you really must stop thinking that youre intelligent. Youre not, in fact, youre plainly a dipshit. Stop just going around making up unsubstantiated rumours about Laurent Le Foll and Camille Lemoine jetting off for Rome! Just fucking stop it! **KONSTANTIN:** It literally says here on this laptop theyve left behind cheapest flights from Paris to Rome. **DASSAULT:** Jesus, its worse than we thought. Le Foll Isn't just a morally corrupt bastard, hes a scrooge! Or poor! **SOULT:** I said, and youll all surely remember this, I said back at the very beginning that I thought Le Foll could be a self-hating Jew! If hes miserly, than he must be! Oh, how right I was, like always! **KONSTANTIN:** No way, man. Le Folls not a Jew. When I used to shill for Russia and various other right-wing groups online, we had a secret forum dedicated to the Jewishness of politicians. Le Foll was one of only three politicians with a Jewishness rating of below 5%, the other two were Geert Wilders and that guy from Star Wars who later became the Governor of California. **MATRIZIANO:** No Star Wars actors were ever the governor of California. **KONSTANTIN:** So what, are you trying to tell me that Andy Schwarzenegger was never Californian governor?? I know my facts! Your Jew rating is 69%! Thats the highest you can get without actually being Jewish! Thats the same as Clinton! Who else could I be talking about? Boss Nass? Meesa no think so, sister! **SOULT:** If Le Foll has gone to Rome, he must surely be heading to Arcangelo, perhaps to activate the Christopher Nolans *Inception* protocol! **DASSAULT:** If thats correct, that would be quite...bad. **LYNCH:** DO ANY OF YOU FELLAS WANT TO FILL ME (and the reader) IN? WHAT THE HELL IS THE CHRISTOPHER NOLANS *INCEPTION* PROTOCOL? **SOULT:** It is the protocol whereby the sitting President of the Geneva Convention, in a time of national emergency, can upload themselves into the Arcangelo supercomputer, and simultaneously exist as both man and some kind of...cyber-God. **LYNCH:** THAT SOUNDS BAD, JACK. I WONDER HOW THAT GOT APPROVED! **SOULT:** Yes, ahem, I do too...now, yes, it sounds bad, but it gets worse. You see, as a nearly omnipotent Artificial Intelligence, Arcangelo has to *agree* with the President to allow the protocol to happen, and it wont agree. If Le Foll tries this, theres every chance that Arcangelo could upload a copy of itself into Laurent Le Folls body, and rule as Supreme Leader of Geneva. As bad as Le Foll is, the Arcangelo AI system in charge of this country would be much worse, like the difference between typhoid and ebola. We need to hurry, I fear. **DASSAULT:** Say no more, my friend, I'll call young Philippe and have him swing by and take us to the airfield. "
15,cyber-crime,worldpowers,[NEWS] Geneva at the Half Century: Crime and Law Enforcement,6,6k3npe,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/6k3npe/news_geneva_at_the_half_century_crime_and_law/,2017-06-29 07:12:55,"^Previously: ^[**1**](URL ***** A great deal of crime-fighting in Geneva has been delegated to the Arcangelo supercomputer system, an enormous data trawler and processor that scrapes information from social media sites, government databases, police inputs, and an eclectic host of other sources. In some ways, the processing capabilities of the Arcangelo supercomputer, which have grown and been upgraded over the decades the system has been active, are almost reminiscent of those of the urban artificial neural networks. Throughout its lifespan, the supercomputer has been responsible for the breakdown of countless criminal organizations, most notably La Camorra in the 2020s. The Arcangelo supercomputer was the digital frontier for the predictive policing algorithms that dominate much of the law enforcement work in Geneva. A common urban legend regarding Arcangelo, often told to new inductees at police academies, is that the supercomputer actually achieved some small degree of self-awareness in the mid-to-late 2040s, a result of the push towards the amalgamation of machine learning and crime-fighting. Some third-party studies have carefully analyzed the way that Arcangelo interacts with urban neural networks, with the most interesting result being that Arcangelo's task executions would sometimes be comparable to the way that urban neural networks would report and analyze criminal activity shortly after Arcangelo had performed a deep engagement with local police forces of the city that the UNN belonged to. For some, this is clearly indicative of the fact that Arcangelo is capable of learning and imitating others. This, in turn, is the subject of intense debate, as a system with the security access and data collection and analysis capabilities held by Arcangelo, combined with the ability for free thought could ultimately act as an enormous threat to any nation's domestic security. Especially if it has learned to hide that it is capable of independent thought. Government agencies on nearly every level have denied that this is the case, and that Arcangelo is solely a tool, albeit a very flexible one. This hasn't abated lengthy online discussions, where many speculate that while Arcangelo is almost certainly an AI, the government has managed to restrain it, or otherwise ""convince"" it to act benevolently. Then there are those that hold the belief that every politician in Geneva is mind-controlled by Arcangelo, which is simply the latest Rothschild proxy. Either way, the predictive algorithms in use by Arcangelo have been instrumental in stopping crimes often before they happen - lining up purchases, call records, social networks, and video monitoring to identify the likelihood of an imminent criminal activity. Oftentimes, officers will wait for the crime to start before intervening - this has resulted in some criticism when it results in damages, or quite rarely deaths, because police didn't intervene sooner. However, the alternative is an arrest on charges of suspicion of intent, which becomes very difficult to prove, and in the time that Arcangelo or one of its subsidiary networks is able to discover that the perp has in fact committed a crime by combing through heaps of information, an attorney is often able to produce a capable defence. More often than not, when a criminal arrested in this way is released, they are shortly after picked up for some other crime, assuming that they are hidden or otherwise immune to the vast information-collection network of the Genevois police forces. The vast majority of Genevois crimes are white collar crimes, and the vast majority of white collar crimes are contracted by still-extant mafias. With automation playing an enormous role in near every sector of the Genevois economy, standard crimes are no longer effective. Smuggling in Naples, for instance, no longer necessitates a large number of enforcers, but instead a group of hackers capable of making self-driving trucks ""disappear"" from the grid, or getting autonomous container ships to state they've unloaded something without actually unloading it. The few enforcers that the mafia employs are often drawn from the heavily prosthetic population. For most organ or body part replacements, Genevois hospitals are able to grow a replacement [*discussed later*], but before this technology was widespread, prosthetics were extremely common, and became increasingly advanced, capable of enormously enhancing the strength of those that wear them. Mafia enforcers are either individuals loaded up with prosthetics and cybernetic implants, or using old haptic exoskeletons, like those often used by military police or Carabinieri. When up against a police force that uses autonomous drones alongside battlefield computers to coordinate raids, criminals have tended to stick to their monitors, and those that have to do physical work are typically well-prepared, biomechanically speaking. Police drones are among some of the most controversial pieces of equipment in use by the Carabinieri and other police forces. While small-scale, energy-dense supercapacitors have allowed for advanced electroshock weapons to often supersede lethal weapons, it's not always enough when faced with a mafia bodyguard with adrenal autoinjectors and carbon-fiber reinforced prosthetics. Autonomous drones capable of using pinpoint microwave weapons to short out personal cybernetics or prosthetics, capture images from various angles, or deploy electroshock weapons are one of the most-used police assets. Nevertheless, programming failures can result in accidental targeting of civilians - catastrophic for police PR, not to mention often the cause of a substantial hole in police funding. Most crimes are conducted over the internet, and few major face-to-face confrontations happen anymore. The largest organized criminal groups in Geneva are the Corsican Mafia, La Cosa Nostra (absorbed and defeated the Stidda in the 2030s), the 'Ndranghetta (which has worked to fill the power vacuum following the dissolution of La Camorra with limited success), and Sacra Corona Unita (which has taken advantage of the explosion in Adriatic shipping to position itself as a major player in Southern Italy). Other organized crime exists with loosely-affiliated French Maghrebi criminal syndicates, and the Greek Mafia (which has fallen in capability after the Genevois legalization of marijuana but still maintains some influence over the vast shipping industry of Southern Europe). Admiration of criminals is still an observable phenomenon in Geneva, no longer focused on the generic, romanticized gangster-type that was so heavily-featured in American film, but instead an appreciation for those few notorious cybercriminals that operate outside of the framework of Geneva's various mafias. One such cybercriminal, identified only as ""3rmanno"", possibly an obscure reference to Ermanno Sangiorgi, a police officer noted for this 19^th and early 20^th century reports on the emergent post-unification mafia, has obtained notoriety for being a ""benevolent"" cybercriminal. In 2049, at the opening times of several Genevois stock exchanges, a large number of commands were rapidly executed from computers across the country, which resulted in the bankruptcy of several construction companies, and the creation of 3 new millionaires before nearly anyone could react. These were all construction companies long thought to be fronts for Southern Italian mafia groups, and the immediate collapse of their share prices, before immediate purchase by a shell corporation of questionable ownership, has been viewed as one of the major blows against Genevois organized crime performed by a civilian. The subsequent investigation revealed that many months beforehand, key data leaks and company registrations had laid the groundwork for the collapse of a substantial portion of the mafia-owned construction industry, and its subsequent purchase by companies that were owned by a maze of false identities and corporate fronts. The only identifying information that popped up was the username ""3rmanno"". While copious evidence of tampering with stock exchange protocols was discovered, there was little that could be done beyond plugging the holes and upping Euronext Geneva's security. There are other instances of cybercrimes that have hit national headlines, but none have captured public enthusiasm quite like 2049 Lightning Buyouts. The reality is that these are not the cybercrimes that the Genevois police focus on. Automated embezzling networks, cellular credit skimmer worms, and corporate cyber-warfare are all far more prevalent, and concerning to near every police force. Substantial advancements in cybercrime-fighting have helped to massively reduce the amount that organized crime pulls from the Genevois economy, but the largest, and most effective, efforts are those that are near-impossible to see - one program set up in 2031 had been siphoning fractions of pennies from hundreds of thousands of supermarket purchases, making titanic profits every month. It was finally shut down in 2043. Police forces have become increasingly advanced, but criminals follow closely behind. As surveillance expands and data collection grows, some claim that crime will be made entirely obsolete. There are rumors of entire mafia groups seeking to legitimize themselves before inevitable capture. It's hard to say which would be worse - a criminal organization attempting to survive at all costs, or a company with access to all the tools that the mafia has to carry out its operations. Some say that they'd fit right in to the corporate community."

Coincidentally, he is also the last remaining member of Hamas left after 30 years of education and liberalization by Israeli authorities in the autonomous Palestinian territories. He had no budget, no resources, none of the illustrious fame and glory once held by Hamas members. Remember the good old days, he would often begin to those he met on the streets of Gaza, where you could slaughter Jewish pig occupiers and still have enough time to go home to your goat-wife at night for dinner? However, this method of advertising, quite surprisingly, failed to net Hamas any members for quite some time. However, everything changed when Yusuf was approached by a group of wealthy Jordanian officials, and his life changed forever. The Jordanians showered him with cash (30, mostly in 1 and 2 coins) as well as resources (a 45-year old desert eagle handgun and 3 rounds of ammunition), and suddenly the future looked bright. Armed with these resources, he made a massive investment in recruitment, and before he knew it, Hamas membership had been increased by 100%! Now, there were TWO members of the terrorist organization, ready to take on Israelis - even if they had to share the handgun. Phoenicia is aware of this. --- In one of the worlds largest ever mass defections, 75,000 Palestinian Arab troops of the Israel Defence Force have either laid down their arms or begun internally fighting with the Jewish and loyalist Arab portions of the IDF. This has caused mass chaos within the ranks of the IDF, as well as causing an estimated 1,689 casualties so far. While being rapidly subdued, this has severely hampered the Israeli offensive operation into the West Bank which has been left facing understrength, infighting divisions and brigades all along the lines. Everyone is aware of this. --- The Jordanians, while perfectly capable at other things seem to have a spectacular lack of ability when it comes to the field of cyber warfare. The Jordanian attempt to penetrate Israels nuclear network consisted of a hastily written email; &gt;Dear Comander of jewkes, &gt;We are about to fite a war against the glorious arabs! As evil jews, we must be using the jewclear weapons we has to fite them even better. we need the jewke coads to fite them. Please giv the coads by replying this email. &gt;thanks [fellow kikes](URL &gt;prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu Mossad were easily able to trace this email back to first an obvious Hamas proxy, then back to the Jordanian government. This comes alongside similar, but intensely more competent, attacks to the Israeli military communications network and the Israeli air defence system. Israels computer systems remain un-compromised in the face of these attacks. The Israelis and Phoenicians are aware of this. --- Nearly 90,000 Israelis protested across the nation of Israel this past week in cities like Tel Aviv, Haifa, West Jerusalem, and Ashdod, demanding a cessation of hostilities immediately with such slogans like Dont gas the Arabs, race war never and GET THE HELLicopters OUT OF JORDAN, to moderate success. While the protests are relatively large, affecting transportation and traffic in some cities, they fail to significantly change Israeli public opinion and completely fail to change the aims of the Israeli government. Everyone is aware of this. --- The Phoenician Sahm-V system is supposedly an upgraded Arrow 4 anti-ballistic missile missile system. Or, it was. Production facilities of the missile across Phoenicia were struck by heavy sabotage and destruction through the utilisation of what has been identified as plastic explosives. The engineering documents for the Sahm-V have also been heavily damaged due to a corresponding cyber attack, leaving the Sahm-V production ground to a halt until the missile designs and the production centers are reconstructed from their fractured current state. Phoenicia and Israel are aware of this. --- 5 Mossad agents have been captured by Phoenician counter-intelligence in association with attempting to locate and destroy Phoenician ballistic missile launch sites. These agents are now in Phoenician military custody, to do with as they so want. So far, they have all remained silent in the face of conventional interrogation tactics, and do not look likely to budge from this position. Phoenicia and Israel are aware of this. --- The Arabian government is informed by their air defence command that Arabian surface-to-air missile defense systems successfully intercepted and destroyed two aircraft attempting to enter Arabian airspace. While the aircraft went unidentified, their stealth character indicates a fifth generation fighter. A further small number of fighter signatures was also detected by Arabian radar, but these peeled off after the destruction of the initial two fighters. Arabia is aware of this. --- Genevan fighters and bombers launched a comprehensive strike against Iraqi goat farms this morning; while identified as Genevan early on in the strikes, their choice of targets was questionable to say the least. The Iraqi goat population has been cut in half, with many men reportedly mourning over the loss of their third wives to this horrendous attack. One local man, Jaff ar-Keak, said that this was despicable, unacceptable and absolutely inconceivable. Another, Barack al-Bama, denounced it as a horrifying war crime in every way. A few Iraqi ICBM sites were hit by a likely stray missile, destroying 3 Al-Nusar I and 5 Al-Nusar II missiles, a small amount of damage compared to the possible millions of goats that were incinerated by overwhelming ballistic barrages. Everyone is aware of this. --- The [SR-72](URL is a technological marvel. Super fast, intensely cool looking and capable of taking lots of spy pictures while going fast it is an extremely advanced UAV. While intended to gather huge amounts of highly valuable strategic intelligence thanks to its advanced technology, the spy plane suffered a malfunction upon entering Iraqi airspace and, to the surprise of both its operators and the Iraqis below, slowed down and landed quite calmly on the runway of an Iraqi airbase. Originally thought to be a sign from Allah or perhaps the return of Muhammad, the plane was initially hailed as a holy object and had already attracted quite a following of holy men and had become a popular location for a sort of half-assed Hajj. Cooler heads prevailed however and the plane was brought to Iraqi military HQ for investigation after reports surfaced of soldiers fellating the plane seeking the blessings of Allah before our jihad. Iraq is aware of this. --- [M] Rather large backlog, here y'all go. Co-written by /u/Vertci"

One of these is hereby described. --- The Polish are well known for being good at many things. Plumbing toilets. Picking potatoes. Being partitioned. Secret operations throughout an Iraqi state wherein the government prepared for war with the majority of the West, you shall likely note, is not on this list; especially where missiles and similar heavy explosives are concerned. The plan to eliminate Iraqi infrastructure, while also a war-crime, was based around the utilisation of civilian airliners to escape after the damage had been done. Of the 200 missiles deployed in Iraq, 40 suffered catastrophic failure due to poor maintenance in the hot desert conditions of Iraq, resulting in the deaths of 300 Polish personnel. Of the remaining 160 missiles launched at various Iraqi targets, 60 suffered mid-air failure and crashed harmlessly into the Iraqi desert. Being anti-ship missiles, the remaining 100 might have done considerable damage against targets that floated. Like ships. However, the Polish had opted to target roads, radar, other infrastructure and docks. The roads got what could probably be described as rather large potholes put in them, that could easily be driven around. The radar installations were damaged - but as it was a hole punched through the radar array dishes, rather than complete destruction, functionality was not removed only reduced. The docks suffered the most damage, as a variety of small dinghys and such suffered from the extreme power of a cruise missile. Ten Iraqis are reported to have died while fishing in harbours. There were now 700 Poles left - of which, in the heavily militarised state of Iraq, 450 were instantly shot and killed after launching the missiles. These remaining 250 quickly initiated phase 2 of the plan - stealing civilian airliners. Nevermind the heavy war-zone in the region, these Polish men and women were doing as they had been ordered! Only 170 survived the Iraqi air defence, on their way to Bahrain. They have all refused further involvement with the Polish Armed Forces. "

So far, there have been no great victories, only low points. That's why it is important to go out on the streets now, and gauge the people's opinion. After all, our grandchildren will someday ask us what we did during the war. What will we say? What do regular Americans think about the war effort. How has the war affected them so far? So, to get answers to these question, CBS News asked three normal Americans about their feelings in the war. A stockbroker from New York City, a car salesman in Nebreska, and an interior designer from Irvine, California. These are their stories: ##**52 William St, New York City, New York** **Who are you and what do you do? :** I'm Jim Karrey, like the old actor but with a K.

Modern stockbrokers would never do stuff like that. I live and work in New York City, the greatest city on the planet, in the greatest country on the planet. I've been in this business for 23 years and I'm quite good at it. Good enough to go on vacations to places like Forcados in the winter and Venice in the summer. I have a wife and two sons. Is that enough? **How has the war affected you? :** My firm does a lot of business on the respective New York stock exchanges. Those exchanges have been the target of Chinese cyber-attacks. I believe NASDAQ was down for almost fifteen minutes. Can you believe that? Anyway, the economy is not doing well. And that usually means work is not as fun as it when the economy *is* doing well. Still, we're kinda used to it right now. Sure, this war is a major event, something we haven't really seen before, but still. During my time as a stockbroker I've seen the flu, the reemergence of the Soviet Union, a war between France and the United States, North Korea blowing up, and China going from ChiCom to ChiDem and back. And I'm not the only one who has seen stuff like that. The market has seen it too, and it kinda gets used to it. My granddad was a stockbroker too. He told me that on September the 17th (red: reopening of the stock market after the 9/11 attacks) , the DJIA fell 684 points. At the end of the week it had become the largest one-week point drop in history. Now, that record has been absolutely shattered by 2024. The impact of those bombs falling on Long Island or whatever was negligible compared to the impact on the DJIA. My point is that yes, the economy is in a bad shape, but it hasn't affected me as much as it would have if this war had happened twenty years ago. We've been through so much crazy shit, trust me when I say that we can handle a little more. **Do you know anyone currently in the military? :** My brother in law has a shipping firm. All his ships got requisitioned by the Merchant Marine. Due to lack of certified captains, he has to take to the seas too. That's not really being in the military, but it's something. ##**408 West 2nd Street, Paxton, Nebreska** **Who are you and what do you do? :** I'm Logan Kazlauskas. I'm 32 years old and I am the very proud owner of Kazlauskas Cars. It might not look like much, but this shop has been continuously up and running since 2018. That might not seem like much, but in the autobranche not many businesses stay open for 29 years (red: 27 years). My dad opened this shop, and I inherited it in 2035. I used to live in Omaha, but live there was too fast for me. I like it here, its more down to earth. Im single, no children but I dont know why you need to know that. **How has the war affected you? :** Most people reading this are probably either from the East or the West Coast. Theyll think: What can some hillbilly car salesman from bumfuck Nebraska possibly have noticed of the war? (***Expletive***) those people! They come over the I-10 with their oversized family SUVs or caravans, acting all shocked when I tell them I dont have a charging station for their fancy Tesla Model 681013XDD or whatever. We dont sell that kind of cars here. If you want ecological family car, you can go to a car shop in SF or something like that. We sell real cars, not fairy mobiles. Anyway, as you may know Offut Airbase got hit by an ICBM during the ChiCom first strike. I was in Omaha visiting a colleague. It was a harrowing experience. These old air raid sirens went on, probably leftovers from the Cold War. Then the tornado warning sirens went on too. Probably because someone panicked and thought, (***expletive***) it. The missile came in at a weird angle, I dont know why, but it went straight over Omaha. I thought it was going to explode right there, over our heads. But it went over us, headed south and exploded at Offut. I later learned the Chinese hadnt even bothered to properly target the Strategic Command facilities. The missile just exploded above the runway and hangars. There was some damage but most of it was fixed within two days. That was my first real war experience. The other experience is in my wallet. You might not have expected it. But for me, this war is an absolute goldmine. Guess what, your fancy Tesla has electronic parts from Japan, Korea and China. And to add insult to injury, the electronic grid suffers from outages after the Chinese attacks. Suddenly this environmental raping Ford Fanto isnt that bad anymore. Im not going to lie to you, business has been though. But now, people coming from as far as Des Moines want to look at my collection. People want the reassuring sound of a hybrid, gas or sometimes even diesel engine. Fuel is plenty, high techy techy is not. No shipping company is going to risk traversing the Pacific right now, thats just suicide. But I bet the ones with the big enough balls, those not already in the Merchant Marine, willing to cross that ocean filled with submarines, mines, and who knows what, those are the guys who will get stinking rich. Because lets face it: Suburban America cant live without its newest Apple device or their smart homes. Thats just the way it is. **Do you know anyone currently in the military? :** One of my buddies from Omaha is in the National Guard. I heard they were prepping to deploy, dont know where to. Im a reservist, so Im kinda in the military, but so far I havent been called in. If that does happen, I might have to close up shop. That would be disappointing. ##**32 Del Pelatto, Irvine, California** **Who are you and what do you do? :** Hi, Im Latisha Durant. Im 36 years old and I live in Irvine California. I work at Durant Interior Experts, along with my two sisters. I have a husband, no children yet, but we do have an adorable dog, which is basically the same thing as having kids, except that kids talk. Our company does interior design, but we also do exterior design and renovations. At a fair price, of course. We won the 2041 Wheeler Award (red: Award for best design company in Southern California), Ive lived in California since 2025. Before that I used to live near Ann Arbor, Michigan, with my sisters and parents, but we left after the flu was over. There wasnt much there for us anymore. That area is doing great right now though. Detroit has really benefited from all the activity around the Great Lakes, with the car industry and all that coming back again. Ive mused about going back there someday, but thats a story for another time. I like it here in LA and Irvine, especially the weather. **How has the war affected you? :** Well, of course business has not been good. These are uncertain times. The Chinese might bomb us again, the economy is not in a good shape, and were not sure how the war is going right now. During times like this, not many people feel the need to redecorate their living room. But we understand that, I think everybody does. Especially in this community. Us black folks have been through a lot. But that goes for everybody in America. I lived in the Detroit area before we moved to the West Coast. I spend my youth there and I saw a lot of wrong. A lot of crime and a lot of poverty. Then the flu came, and we all know what happened then. What that city did to itself Thats why we moved. My father never admitted it, but I knew we went away because he could no longer look his neighbors in the eye. I wish we all banded together and rode out the storm. But God knows it didnt went like that. Poor people always suffer the most in times of crisis. And back then a lot of blacks were poor. And that flu swept through the black community like a tornado. We were absolutely decimated. We were the poorest, so we were also the hungriest. And because of that we were the weakest, and thus we got hit hardest by the disease. Everybody has lost someone back then, a colleague, a distant relative, maybe even a son or a wife. But a lot of blacks lost everyone. All their acquaintances, their church groups, their colleagues. All gone. Right now, people barely remember how it was in America. They dont remember the crime, the racial tension, and the police shootings. More people were killed in one week in the Southside of Chicago than in a year in the entirety of Norway. That was how it was. Nowadays were doing fine. In fact, we top the list of ethnics groups by household income. But no black man or woman will say that it was worth it. Hip-hop, the blues, Ebonics. A lot less common nowadays, and I think thats a shame. My point is that we lived through all of that, so we dont care if the newest Samsung phone isnt in stock anymore. No eggs? Well just buy something else then. This generation of Americans wont riot because of an absence of goods. Thats because we are the children of the people that bashed each others heads in for a piece of bread during the dark days. We watched all that happen and were determined to never let it happen again. So, business might be though but thats just how things are. **Do you know anyone currently in the military? :** My nephew was on the Martin Luther King Jr. It was asking for bad luck, naming a ship after Dr King. He made it though. My nephew is a hard boy, a good boy. He swam for two hours before he was rescued. And thats quite an achievement, since most of us still dont swim that good. Hes on another carrier now, not sure which one. He is still in the fight. We all are. "

I'll have your scalp cut off you whore!"" &gt; ""... What have I done?"" &gt; *Slap!* &gt; ""I aologize for my crimes... "" &gt; *Slap!* ""I need your character, I need your charm. Talk like your addressing Mekong. I need you to act like *you.* &gt; ""... Can you please just tell me why I am here? I haven't done anything against the CPMU, I was trying to resolve the protests-"" &gt; *Slap!* ""You undermined Socialism, you undermined the Chairman, you undermined the people."" *** &gt; Today in Bangkok, protests broke out after the arrest of Sinee Nik, with the protestors storming police forces. The Head of Thailand, Dok-Phi-Sua, claimed support for the Flower Revolution, calling for change in Mekong. The CPMU has yet to comment thoroughly on the situation in Thailand, and the rebellion in Malaysia, yet says that everything is under control and the protests are a minor nuisance. We can attest to the opposite, as our press headquarters in Kuala Lumpur before being raided by the police, stated that the coup was still undergoing. Reports of Fighter Jet combat, tanks, and machine gun fire have all continued to pour out of Kuala Lumpur and Johor. ~ *The New York Times* *** Elements of the THOT patrol that have joined the Revolution will be tasked to fight their former comrades. It is unknown where Sinee Nik's location exactly is, but it is suspected that she is being tortured and forced to state dogma of the CPMU. This is, not only a crime against humanity, but a crime against Mekong. This cannot be allowed to continue, and the people must be put first. Not the party, not the Chairman, but the will of the people. A beginning phase of intelligence gathering will begin the operation. Elements loyal to the Nikist Party within enemy ranks will leak all information that can possibly be gathered on Nik's whereabouts, however it is suspected that she has been moved from Malaysia to an unkown location in the sea. Possibly a ship, or Oil Rig. Therefore, information gathering will focus on troops currently within the sea, including the movement of politicians and enemy THOT members. After enough intelligence is gathered, Phase 2 will begin. After the location of Sinee Nik has been pinpointed, a coordinated raid will begin. Cyber warfare will ensure that all communications on site will be disconnected from the external world, silencing the base. There will be an estimated reaction time of twenty minutes to an hour before CPMU forces realize that the base has stopped responding and is under attack. THOT forces will, in coordination with one another, assault the base using the following insert methods; &gt; 1. A squadron of stealth-fighters will be tasked to nuetralizing anti-aircraft facilities on sight, if any. This is the riskiest phase of the operation, therefore purely kinetic missiles will be used that do not detonate, yet hit AA installations at such speeds that it is destroyed. The explosives of the missiles will be removed for the operation. &gt; 2. THOT forces will be inserted to the Oil-Rig/Ship through Helicopter and Parajumping, it is suspected that the sudden onset of troops will confuse and disorient enemy forces. Enemy forces will be nuetralized, and Sinee Nik will be escorted out by THOT forces. Time is of the essence, and focus will be put on getting Sinee Nik and providing an escape corridor. &gt; 3. Sinee Nik will be escorted out through Helicopter, THOT forces will provide support to the escaping helicopter before retreating themselves. *** [M]Anything below an average of a 10 is a failure. "

If passed this bill would allow for the creation and funding of a deradicalization program, along with community support and outreach systems (many at the state and local level) to help ensure that the influence of any potential recruiters is minimal at best. This bill would also authorize money to be appropriated to the recreation of a cyber command, along with reaching out and incentivizing companies to block, trace, and prosecute radicals who recruit over the internet and post Pro-Radical content. The deradicalization bill specifically would appropriate $500 (Mil.) to outreach services and hire psychiatrists among others to help victims of this crime. Implementation would be over the course of a year. Long term rehabilitation and job placement services for deradicalized men and women will be offered to help them rejoin society in a positive way. The Cyber Command will be established at several [REDACTED] locations and will also receive an office in the Pentagon. $2 (Bil.) from the military budget will be dedicated the first year, $1 (Bil.) for every following year to help recruit, train, and implement cyber protection over government files and critical infrastructure. The private companies in order to fully shut down an account in the proposed partnership with Cyber Command analysis would have to obtain a warrant to shut down an account. If an account that can be proven to be run by the same person, but under a different false-flag name appears the warrant is still valid, however it is not a general warrant."

The maximum sentence shall be 40 years in prison, with no chance of parole. President Castro has said the internet has allowed these acts of crime to garner more support and that action must be taken to stop these criminals. After the sources of the video are removed from the internet, the new Cuban Technological Protection Force will crack down on other sources of child pornography, terrorism, the black market, and other items that are commonly found on the deep-web. Any citizens found using the TOR network or other routers to access said deep-web will be tried for illegal black market activity, drug charges, child pornography, or other charges based on the suspect's usage of the deep-web."
