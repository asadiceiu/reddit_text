This is NOT confirmed with Ned himself but more so evidence that seems logical to which if ends up true, I will post updates at the end of the post. The vulnerability itself although not 100% confirmed at this stage has had its unique CVE reserved on December 18th 2019 accessible [here](URL The reason I am including the link is interesting to the point this could be the date or there around when the vulnerability was reported to the vendor, why is this important? A quote from Ned Williamson on Twitter stating: &gt;Excited to start the new year with CVE-2020-3842 :) It's a fun one and unlike the other bugs I reported so far so I'm looking forward to (responsibly) disclosing it. The key word here is ""responsibly"" although we don't know for sure when the vulnerability was disclosed to the vendor, the link provided above is an interesting find as to why the CVE was even reserved in December if it wasn't discovered yet. # Possible Release: Inline with Project Zero's 90 days policy, all newly discovered vulnerabilities reported to the vendor in 2020 by default have to wait the full 90 days before the bug becomes publicly available to everyone to research. If the issue CVE-2020-3842 was reported in December the policy becomes invalid and reverts to 90 days or if fixed, whichever comes quicker. However what I think may happen is Ned will wait the full 90 days regardless of the fix already present in iOS 13.3.1 due to that being a responsible time to do so, or the bug was discovered and reported in January 2020 and per the new policy that was what would happen anyway, but why the CVE would get reserved in mid December is confusing to say the least. My speculations are below; * Vulnerability discovered in December 2019 &amp; reported. * Patched in iOS 13.3.1 January 28th - security advisory [here](URL * Ned will release the vulnerability and write-up 90 days from report date/issue fixed.

A majority of vulnerabilities Apple patched this month reside in its web rendering engine WebKit, which is used by many apps and web browsers running on the Apple's operating system. According to the [advisory](URL just opening a maliciously crafted web content using any vulnerable WebKit-based application could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, disclose sensitive user information, bypass sandbox restrictions, or launch universal cross-site scripting attacks on the device. Among the WebKit vulnerabilities include a consistency issue (CVE-2019-6222) that allows malicious websites to potentially access an iOS device microphone without the ""microphone-in-use"" indicator being shown. A similar vulnerability (CVE-2019-8566) has been patched in Apple's ReplayKit API that could allow a malicious application to access the iOS devices microphone without alerting the user. &gt;""An API issue existed in the handling of microphone data. This issue was addressed with improved validation,"" Apple says in its advisory briefing the ReplayKit bug. &amp;#x200B; Apple has also patched a serious logical bug (CVE-2019-8503) in WebKit that could have allowed malicious websites to execute scripts in the context of another site, allowing them to steal your information stored on other sites or launch a wide-range of online attacks. Besides WebKit issues, the advisory also revealed the existence of a critical flaw in earlier iOS versions that could lead to arbitrary code execution just by convincing victims into clicking a malicious SMS link. The SMS vulnerability, identified as CVE-2019-8553, appears to affect iPhone 5s and later, iPad Air and later, and iPod touch 6th generation devices. Apple has also patched a total of six vulnerabilities in iOS kernel, of which CVE-2019-8527 could allow a remote attacker to crash the system or corrupt kernel memory, CVE-2019-8514 could be used to elevate privileges, and rest allow malicious apps to read memory layout. The technical details and proof-of-concept code for the newly patched flaws are yet unavailable. :( &amp;#x200B;"

Every day without jailbreak makes me angry about this stupid limited stock iOs not doing the things I want but the things Apple wants.

Sadly my perfect 6S (128) on 9.3.3 caught a bootloop back in December and had to be updated to 11.2.6 to work at all (now gave it to my mum) and the 7 (256) already shipped with 11.2.5, so I updated it some time ago to 11.2.6 as there were some CVE for this version. But I missed the 11.3.1 signing window and got invalid 11.3 blobs (chose Global instead of GSM and was only able to save 11.3 Beta 6 Blobs). Got some guy on Ebay with the same 7 (256) on 11.1.2, but he took out the listing and wanted to jailbreak himself.

I'm just curious about what people think of their security of their devices whilst being jailbroken or staying on the lowest firmware whilst awaiting on a jailbreak. According to URL there have been 46 Medium &amp; High remotely executable vulnerabilities addressed within iOS over the years. These include the most recent in ios 11.2: CVE-2017-13903 (and more) - Homekit vulnerability allowing acccess to IoT devices (door locks etc) CVE-2017-13879 - ios &lt;11.2 - IOMobileFrameBuffer execute arbitrary code in a privileged context CVE-2017-13876 - iOS &lt;11.2 - execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges CVE-2017-13870/CVE-2017-13866 - ioS &lt;11.2 - maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution CVE-2017-13867 - iOS &lt;11.2 - execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges More high profile is: CVE-2017-11120 - ios &lt;11 - This is a pretty scary one, POC code has been released which allows read/write access to the broadcom firmware remotely. CVE-2017-13861 - ios &lt;11.2 - Async_wake which as we can see once ran gives full root access to the entire filesystem CVE-2017-7047 - iOS &lt;10.3.3 - Access to userland privileges, but someone has written a cred stealer. Given we have so much of our life on our devices between finance app, work emails and social networking our devices are a pretty big target. So my questions are: * 1: Do you worry that being jailbroken or staying on old firmware could leave you open to attack? * 2: Do you think that we will see patches for major issues rolled out by developers on cydia. Back in the day when a fairly serious SSL trust issue was found (CVE-2014-1266) a cydia package was created (SSLPatch) which solved the issue. I know personally the security of my device is a big concern, given that my device can be compromised via a malicious website(CVE-2017-13870/CVE-2017-13866) or a backdoored IPA (tripple fetch/async_wake). I would hope that we would see something like SuperSU on android which detects when something is requesting higher privileges as a way of balancing having a jailbreak and being secure. "

At this point it is possible to jailbreak by patching more functions, the ones related to sandbox and code signing  Pangu did it but only for 64-bit devices. Anyway, I wanted to share the code with everyone to help understanding what's in Lookout paper, I posted the link on [my twitter](URL a few minutes ago: [GitHub repository](URL Note that it only exploits CVE-2016-4655 and CVE-2016-4656 (kernel vulns) via a crafted app. Enjoy!"

29,CVE,jailbreak,[Discussion] Jailbreaking iOS 9.1 and 9.2,0,434if7,https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/434if7/discussion_jailbreaking_ios_91_and_92/,2016-01-29 05:12:44,"It's been frustrating waiting for Pangu and/or TaiG to announce an official jailbreak since 9.1 came out and broke Pangu's jailbreak. I totally understand why the like to keep silent (as to not stir up drama, to keep exploits secret, etc.), and I also understand why they play the waiting game (I believe it's because they want to make sure they release the jailbreak at a time where a maximum amount of people can get it since they are being paid for this). However, it has come to my attention that a glaring exploit has just been patched in iOS 9.2.1 (and actually OS X 10.11.3 as well, since the 2 platforms are not all that different under the hood). In particular, I am referring to CVE-2016-1722, which was briefly discussed on Apple's security page giving the updates about what 9.2.1 has patched: URL CVE-2016-1722 is listed as a vulnerability in syslogd, a program that is part of both iOS and OS X. On Apple's website, the ""impact"" of the exploit is that ""a local user may be able to execute arbitrary code with root privileges"". I decided to do some more digging on the matter and found that the security team who discovered the exploit posted a blog entry with a much more detailed explanation, pointing to the specific source code that is affected: URL Now, I've just recently learned C, but the exploit they pointed out here is quite a classic case of how to write unsafe software in C (which is also an inherently unsafe language since it has direct access to a computer's memory). It's basically just a PEMDAS screw up; they forgot to put the parentheses around the right numbers! Anyways, I digressed a little, but my point is that this exploit is clearly available on iOS 9.1 and 9.2, it seems like a solid way to jailbreak devices, so maybe instead of just waiting for TaiG and Pangu to jailbreak 9.3 (or whatever will be next), maybe it is possible to use this exploit to jailbreak it without an ""official"" jailbreak release. I am not an expert in security testing nor do I (currently) know how to jailbreak an iDevice once a vulnerability has been discovered, but I was hoping that maybe /r/jailbreak had some input on the idea of developing some kind of ""community jailbreak"" so for those of us waiting patiently on 9.1 and 9.2 can jailbreak again. So, does anyone here know how to proceed when such a vulnerability is found? Do you guys like this idea of trying to put together a jailbreak for 9.1 and 9.2? Let me know what you all think. TL;DR: there's a gaping vulnerability in 9.1 and 9.2 and no JB tool released, lets JB it ourselves!"
