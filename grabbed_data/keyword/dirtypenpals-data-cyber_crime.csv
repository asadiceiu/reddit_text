If you're like me, you've probably been keeping up with the video-game known as Cyberpunk 2077. I've always, even before it's announcement, enjoyed the Cyberpunk genre and have played it in before; It has been a long time since, but I'm interested in playing a cyber prostitute that was raped and dismantled for her cyborg parts and left for dead somewhere. I'd like for someone to save her and restore her to her former glory, after which she'll want to take revenge on those that crossed her. She discovers that the men that ""killed"" her dedicated themselves to target prostitutes, so she takes it upon herself to seduce them and kill anyone involved. Nothing more bad ass and sexy than a broken woman that reclaims her sexuality even after being raped. I thoroughly enjoy the challenge of playing the victim. Now, where do you come in? It really depends what you're feeling - want to be the one to destroy her life? Want to be the one who saves her? Feeling like you can play both? Go ahead. I encourage you to play multiple characters. We can anywhere you want, with the savior finding her barely conscious and naked, without arms, without legs, without her precious technology, her lifeline, her business. Let me know what you think and, please, don't feel restricted EVER to this prompt since I can play as other characters as well if YOUR ideas are good enough or expand furthermore on the original one I planted. My kinks here are: rough sex, incest, age-play (a younger woman, older man; older woman, younger man), deepthroating, sloppy bjs, choking, BDSM, consensual, non-con, dub-con, sex for money, slapping, smacking, spitting, light beating, being whipped or branded, gangbangs, helpless situations, slow-burn (short fuze tho), forced prostitution, public play, being caught. . .and many more as well (just check my post history) My limits are not many, just no scat or vore/gore. You can also ask me if you're unsure it's a kink of mine. Message me privately (orange envelopes) if you're interested in any of these scenarios or SUGGEST me your own for some bonus points."
1,cyber crime,dirtypenpals,[F4M] Cyberpunk High-Class Prostitute; Prostitutes and Crime Syndicates (Discord) (3rd) (High-Lit),1,iedz7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/iedz7v/f4m_cyberpunk_highclass_prostitute_prostitutes/,2020-08-22 17:01:23,"*In the upper quadrants of the paradisiac city of Lukunna, district of the wealthy, of the fortunate ones, resided those born in nursery beds of gleaming, golden satin sheets, with pillows of sandy silver smidgeons that molded and melted harmlessly around the heads of newborns that knew never of any inconvenience. In the stratums of this expensive, addicting Paraiso, everything and everyone was easily disposable; inconveniences were pawns, players over the chess table, knocked away by bright, distorted and lavender-colored fingernails.* *In the sky-walk dawdled a woman, her comfort shielded by the existence of this great tunnel between the two greatest buildings of the city she had sworn herself to reach; behind her was a wall of windows with a view of a skyline so unparalleled to the rest of the world, the shroud of the night upon them.* *The floor was made as if of tangent clouds, floors of marble so transparent that it allowed sight beneath the woman, the entire hall composed with an architecture so sharp and sophisticated it seemed as if only greedy pigs and obedient, cunning sluts walked in its ambience of opulence.* *Yet, the woman contrasted with the excessive whiteness, sporting a dress of reflections that hugged her body hungrily, red stilettos mottled with blotches of black for shoes, her skin pale and tinctured in alabaster beneath the attire, her curves professed to the man she was expecting at this instance - Mr. Rodonellio, her newest client. She'd been waiting there for far too long, tapping her left heel as a luxurious ship, elegant and rotund, passed suddenly behind and above her, streaking its lights past and through the bridge, the intense whites contrasting with the clouds, illuminating the entirety of the hall for a split second, her golden locks shimmering as light was cast on it. Annie was startled by her own spectacle, a shiver running through her, the golden plating over her cheeks - what she called golden freckles - were silenced after the darkness came again.* *""That must be you, late as always,"" she voiced through her communications, the auricular installed in the canals of her ear, lifting not a finger to dial Mr. Rodonellio, freely scorning him.* *""Who do you think I am? You're 30mins late, Mr. Rodonellio. I am not a common slut, not those fuckin' stupid harlots from the lower quadrants in Velenal. My time is money; I have thirty other clients waiting and you have the nerve to allow me to wait this long? I'm at at the stupid bridge. You best send your bodyguards to pick me up,"" she angrily continued, yapping, her voice one of dominance and authority, a rampant money-maker, greed ever by her side, eyeing the ship above her as it landed with the fat, Italian bastard, member of nothing, simply a man with money, aiding others and enjoying his life of tranquility, a married man elsewhere, a whore addict here.* *\*\*\** Greetings there!

2,cyber crime,dirtypenpals,"29[F4A] Seeking long term RP partner(s). Multiple RP hooks within. Prefer Fantasy / Sci-fi settings. Or down to earth, slice of life with gender and orientation play (Open to suggestions here.)",1,gxry3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/gxry3i/29f4a_seeking_long_term_rp_partners_multiple_rp/,2020-06-07 00:27:14,"Good Morning fellow dirty pen pals, wonderful to see youve stopped by Are you interested in partnering up with a salaciously minded, sexually adventurous and experienced roleplaying partner? If so, you are in the right place! Hope to meet you soon. Oh! You can call me Ana by the way. Seems like it is one of those days again - the days when I just can't help myself. Days where filthy indulgences and scandalous desires beg for satisfaction and are all that fill my mind. These days arn't too uncommon for me, often I find myself driven by lust so potent my imagination cant help but run wild. I regularly entertain daydreams the like of which would see an otherwise unassuming woman like myself branded slut or nymphomaniac should the more prudish among us discover their true breadth and daring. Perhaps it is a brand I deserve but if so it is one I would wear with pride. I embrace my sexuality and with that admission know that I am looking for someone similarly aware of their own lascivious nature. I seek someone to share my unfettered sexually sensuous self with; lust laden dalliances and all. A like-minded partner that is creative, capable and carnal of mind. Think you might be the one? I sure hope so! Before we strike up a conversation together, however, there are a few things you might like to know. Here are a few quick tidbits in no particular order: I am an avid, experienced role player that prefers multi-paragraph but flexible posting from the third person point of view. I fancy myself sapiosexual first and pansexual second. I am a voracious reader, aspiring writer, terrible gamer, all-encompassing nerd, insatiable floozy and proud pervert. I have a predisposition for exotic settings and equally exotic characters, pulling inspiration from nearly every genre of literature and the weird landscape of my own mind. Finally, I possess a veritable armada of fantasies and fetishes each of which I so dearly wish to poke and prod at. Know that I am not easily shocked and appreciate blunt honesty when sharing any and all of your deep seeded carnal instincts. Very few limits will impede our shared sexual exploration and deviance. Still interested? Good! Know that of all the things I seek in a partner the ability to be fearlessly creative is the single trait I value the most. Know that I have many settings, characters and plot hooks I can offer freely to spark us off, but, also know that I thrill in discovering anothers deep seeded fantasies. Furthermore, know that I adore world building and would be happy to spend my afternoon doing just, crafting an idea from a spark to a blaze; after all what we build together with passion and flare will undoubtedly lead us towards a splendidly messy finale. Of course who am I to post here without a few ideas of my own? I'd still love to hear your own ideas, but, here are a few plot hooks that might be of interest: &amp;#x200B; &gt;**The Long Haul** &gt; &gt;*Possible Erotic Themes  Incest, Seclusion, Transhumanism, Enhancement, Corruption* &gt; &gt;Hook  The infinite gulfs of black between the motes of light that illuminate our Galaxy require a toll of time to traverse, a lonely endeavor. Payload Inc. is an innovative, interstellar logistics operation. A family oriented enterprise captained by a father, daughter duo. Genevieve Kavanagh and her Daddy make a team like no other, natural born spacer stock through and through. Together, alone, the Kavanagh family livelihood brings seclusion and cramped spaces, the pair oft spending weeks or months on end braving the solitary reaches of deep space. With civilization all but a distant memory and not a pair of eyes to judge for hundreds of billions of kilometers in any direction it is easy to lose ones selves to burgeoning desire born of claustrophobic confines. It wont be long until the spark of mutual lusts ignite passions as quick to burn out of control as a rampaging brush fire, wanton need escalating beyond the bounds of the taboo. A shared sexual awakening certain to change the lives of this daddy, daughter team. Settling in to the new paradigm of their relationship the taboo couple might just discover what one might consider the best possible use of their Companys profits, a top-end suite of his and her body improvements exploring the realms of genetic manipulation, cyber-ware, cutting edge organic enhancements and enthusiast implants. &gt; &gt;**Goblin Games** &gt; &gt;*Possible Erotic Themes: Interracial of the Fantasy variety - Alcohol + Drugs - Prostitution* &gt; &gt;Minxi is the sole proprietor of The Dragon's Dalliance Drinkhouse, one of the most popular watering holes in the Lotus Kingdom's capitol city. A successful woman by any measure, as a Goblin her achievements are almost unheard of. Minxi is a greedy and gregarious green Goblin Goddess that is as gorgeous as she is graceful. Penelope Puzzle is Minxi's firecracker of a sister that owns a brothel just across the street. The sisters are competitive to a fault and will do anything to one up the other. Some say that they have a high stakes bet going between one another, winner takes all and that their rivalry started when they were but girls when one stole the other's boyfriend; though who stole whose is uncertain. Their businesses have found a comfortable and lucrative home in the city's red light district. A raucous and bawdy bar that serves all manner of prurient patron and an indecorous brothel worked by waif and wench, and everything from Goblin to Elf. &gt; &gt;**Mindfuck** &gt; &gt;*Possible Erotic Themes: Mind Control - Virtual Avatars - Body Swap - Body Modification - Gender Manipulation - Reprogrammed Personality - Group Sex - Public Sex* &gt; &gt;Hook  With the advent of full dive virtual reality and the digitization of the Human mind a new and insidious category of crime has emerged. Despite developers claiming the iron clad security of their networks the mind can be vulnerable to the ingenious predator when one invests their consciousness so completely into a computer simulation. Those with the skill to pull off a Mind Hack are exceedingly rare for the Human mind remains incredibly resilient to tampering even with the sensorium all but hijacked already by a world seeming as real as any other. At least one person has devised a way burning down the safeties to access the raw melange of code that makes up the greater whole that is the digital mind. Such access would allow unprecedented power over a person, ther veritable ability to rewrite a Human being, modify memory, tweak even an established personality and even assume control of motor function. This individual scours the net seeking that one perfect victim to make their plaything, their internet doll. &gt; &gt;**Yumi's Yummies: Confectionery and Cream** &gt; &gt;*Possible Erotic Themes  Loss of Innocence, Corruption, Otaku, Incest, Prostitution.* &gt; &gt;Hook  This is the tale of a young Japanese womans decent into depravity. Yumi Shinozaki finally took the plunge! She had always dreamed of travelling somewhere exotic, so in the run up to high school graduation she applied to a half dozen North American universities. Finally! A prestigious campus in Canada accepted her! It had all worked out perfectly, her Uncle even lived in the city and had a spare guest room she could rent to save some money. Of course Karlys Mother protested the choice stating she was not comfortable with Karly living anywhere near that man. Karlys new host turns out to be quite the pervert and between an Otaku Uncle and the temptations of University life Karly finds herself upon a lascivious crash course of sexual awakening. Taking a job at an Ice Cream Parlour to pay her own way the newly minted nympho is quick to mix business and pleasure. &gt; &gt;**The Scarlet Second** &gt; &gt;*Possible Themes - Aliens, Mega Constructs, Hyper Technology, Transhumanism, Prostitution, Interspecies relations, Sexual Freedom, Drugs, Party Lifestyle, High-tech sex toys, Exhibitionism.* &gt; &gt;Hook - The Scarlet Second is the Milky Way Galaxys preeminent, prurient paradise, a tourist destination like no other. A Ring World of gargantuan proportions the infamous Scarlet Second offers temptation and excitement sure to seduce even the most discerning and exotic of Galactic species. This is an entire artificial world, forged from the component molecules of hundreds of infant planets, built to fulfill the singular purpose of getting the collective rocks of the Milky Ways vast and varied inhabitants off. From posh pubs to legendary parties, lascivious amusements and the Galaxys most exquisite prostitutes The Scarlet Second has anything and everything one might desire. And dont forget, as one old Earth saying goes, What happens on The Scarlet Second stays on The Scarlet Second! &gt; &gt;**Dangerous Days** &gt; &gt;*Possible Erotic Themes  Psuedo NonCon, Corruption, Size Differences, Transformation, Addiction.* &gt; &gt;Hook  Cheesy, 1980s B-grade science fiction in all its gawdy glory. Think Escape from New York fucks Heavy Metal magazine, this is their baby. All big hair, leather and latex fashion and overt sexualization all wrapped up with b-movie ridiculousness. The Ever Night has dawned, darkness swallowing our planet whole. The failing electric light of Humanity's greatest cities and the sombre blood red glow of our eclipsed sun the final light that will touch our Earth. Brutish things stalk the deepest shadows to drag men and women to the darkness where ill fates and new twisted beginnings await. Those taken are changed never again able to find solace or pleasure in the arms of another Human again; Only the Dark Ones will serve. &gt; &gt;**Double Dipping** &gt; &gt;*Possible Erotic Themes - Cuckold, Domination, Lengthy Seduction, Cheating, Polyamorous Relationships* &gt; &gt;Hook  A bisexual dominatrix separately seduces the Husband and Wife of a classic nuclear family thus kicking off a sordid tale of love, lust and infidelity that climaxes in our intrepid anti-heroine bringing the couple together, same place, same time, same purpose, just to watch the sparks fly. So, are you interested? If my eccentricity has not chased you away let us enjoy an adventure, or many, together, ones of sexual deviance, exotic wonder, dazzling extremes and so much more. Drop me a red letter in my box and let's indulge."
3,cyber crime,dirtypenpals,"[M4F] Quarantined in California, Bored and Seeking to Write Smut (Mulitple Prompts Inside)",1,fynlbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fynlbn/m4f_quarantined_in_california_bored_and_seeking/,2020-04-11 06:06:05,"# Lockdown Well, the city is on quarantine, I am on paid work leave, and I find myself sitting in front of the PC because my gym is closed and nothing on Netflix appeals to me. My inspiration to write stories has solely been attached to how exciting my partner is. Lackluster, unmotivated, and uninspired players make me feel empty and bored while chatting. I hope to meet someone who excites me. # About Me This is a quick reference for me so you know who you're talking to and can get to know me better. Anything I missed feel free to ask me over Discord if/once we start chatting. * **Straight(ish)** \- I consider myself straight IRL, however, in a story when writing with a FEMALE partner, I am willing to write plots where my character is bisexual. I am pretty much always a top in such stories making the occasional shemale I fuck my sub or any femboy characters suck my cock. * **Dominant** \- I am pretty much always the dominant in my stories. I can get switchy and let a female take control but 99% of the time it will eventually lead me to being in control again. We can discuss this further. * **Looks** \- I am over 6 feet tall, dark brown hair, nice thick beard, green eyes (w/ glasses), broad shoulders, thick arms/legs, and sturdy core, yes, I have abs. I am 34 which means I got some salt in my beard/hair but besides that I got a young face to save the smile lines off the corner of my eyes. Doesn't hurt I have a nice big cock to boot. My only regret is my fair skin and wishing I was taller. I mean... I am bigger than most guys but who wouldn't want to be 6'6? * **Political** \- I Majored in Political Science, Minored in History. I am a political person and in these trying times, I have very little patience for people with MAGA hats or anyone who denies science or newspapers. If you're a Trumpublican, I am not the person you wanna be playing with. P.S. Please vote Democrat, no matter who. * **California Native** \- Knowing this will let you know who my people are and more importantly where my timezone is. It's a pretty fucking awesome state to live in with Surfing and Snowboard a days drive from each other. Not sure why this is important. * **Geeky** \- I love video games, build my own PC, read various books, and collect comics. I just got my first 3D Printer and started to make a proton pack piece by piece. Appeal to my geeky nature if you want my affection. * **Hyper Creative** \- I been writing plots for over 20 years now and a hundred profiles, dozens of characters and thousands of plots. I don't mean to sound braggy but I got a great creative/dirty mind. # About You Consider this a checklist of what I am looking for in a female roleplay companion. Note the top part of the list is a must and the bottom portion is optional. * **Creative** \- Gotta have a creative bone in your body to roleplay. If you cant ask story-related questions then you better be able to answer them. Having a picture of a hot girl as your avatar doesn't mean much to me. * **Geeky** \- Girls who love books, comics, video games, sci-fi/fantasy shows, and more are the best. I love athletic girls but I will take a nerdy girl any day of the week. * **Perverted** \- A cornerstone of a great roleplay is kinky mind. If you got flexible kinks then you're going to do well with me. If you wanna know more about my dirty side let me know I got an F-list for ya. * **Funny** \- I love a person with a sense of humor. Wit goes a long way with me. Spamming a bunch of random memes, however, is not a sign of being witty. * **Progressive** \- I am a progressive and I will be voting for the Democratic nominee (so should you) no matter who it is. If you're a Republican/Trump supporter. It's best we don't play because if/when I find out, I will go off on you for voting for the idiots... I mean Conservatives. * **Friendly** \- I won't ask for personal info (ever) or your name. That said no descriptive info like A/S/L and personal questions like you're favorite music, passions, and dislikes will likely come up. I hope this can grow into a friendship. * **Discord Play** \- It's the only chat worth using. Since you can edit posts, post character pics and make mini servers. * **Multiple Characters** \- My stories often have a cast of characters. We will, of course, have our lead characters but if you only play one female then you're a one-trick pony and that's boring. * **Brainstorming** \- You have to be willing to work with me on building stories. Its a quick turn off when I am answering my own questions, finding all the pics, and making the world/NPC's all by myself. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female that won't cut it for me. If your trans, you can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling it or not. Thanks for understanding * **Picture Sharing (Optional)** \- Not pics of ourselves but character pictures for our story using hentai or real-life models as references. I hope you have a fun porn collection. * **Voice Chat (Optional)** \- I write most of my erotic stories but sometimes planning them goes quickly with a voice chat. It's not mandatory and I won't pressure you but it does move things along and I do have a sexy voice. * **Video Gaming (Optional)** \- I been pairing video games with roleplays lately. Playing a bit of Stardew Valley and then doing a story about two horny farms building a home together. Playing Conan Exiles and then writing a story about two barbarians capturing slaves and building an empire. Inquire if you like. # Original Stories &amp; Characters A list of originalish stories that I have built up over the years. Some come from erotic fiction I read in the past, others I just developed on my own. I kept the descriptions short for easy digestion of the mind. **The 13 Kingdoms** \- A complex fantasy setting taking fables/fairy tales and applying them in a complex/dark setting.

Familiar women become victims. **The Andromeda Initiative** \- Thousands of women are sent to a different galaxy to colonize it for humanity. **Around the World in 80 Lays** \- Classic story only this time focused on a scientist/adventurer trying to prove that humanity is equal regardless of skin color. A wholesome pervy raceplay plot. **Ay Papi** \- A Latina convinces her white husband to bed her and her mature daughters. Welcome to the open family. **B1M8O Flu -** Bimbo flu is a randomized virus with multiple outcomes after exposure. Humanity is adapting to this disease and it is treated like any other seasonal disease. **The Backpacker** \- A lucky backpacker travels the world and encounters exotic beauties from the four corners. **Bad Dog (Anthro Plot)** \- A basic anthro setting about a big black wolf with a bad reputation and some beautiful vixen who decides he isn't all that bad and slowly makes him into her boyfriend. **Beefy Beasts (Anthro Plot)** \- A gym dedicated to fit studs and toned women getting it on. Normally this is anthro story, however, it can be easily tweaked to have human characters. **Big Cock Bully (Character)** \- A character type with a mean bully type stealing away beautiful women from another man. I have various sub-personalities that click into this character to change the type of bully he is. **Body Shifters Universe** \- Shapeshifting alien females that can look like anyone woman come to earth to live on our world. Did I mention they live solely off cum? Shits gonna get crazy. **Breaking A Super -** Super Heroine gets in over her head and captured and broken by someone.

He is best suited in a college or Olympic setting. **Castaways** \- A plot where athletes, actresses, models, or whatever get stranded on a tropical island with no chance of escape. I have a few islands with fun tweaks for me to tell you about. **Castaways: Longshot** \- Same idea as above only its a crashing spaceship on an alien world. This has a bigger scifi twist on it and deserves being noted. **Caveman Complex** \- A virus is regressing a man into a brute himbo caveman. His urges will be taken out on those around him for sure. **Celestial City** \- A Sailor Moon-like setting with mature Magic Girls losing to villains and receiving bad ends where they are fucked, corrupted and sometimes impregnated by their enemies. **Chronicles of Mareth** \- A Corruption of Champions story where a hero(es) are turned into deviants the longer they stay in this world. I have many subplots for this setting. **Clipped** \- A strange alien item is attached to a person and has strange effects. **The Collector: Waifu Harem** \- A impossible plot about a man who can travel between worlds and collect the hottest of women to become his personal harem. **Conques &amp; Corruption** \- A generic fallen castle story where a Kingdom (usually full of women) falls to an enemy force of brutal hung warriors who use them after the battle is over. **Cryptozoology** \- A fun setting where we explore a group of scientists/explorers who find hidden beasts across the world. Google the term if you don't know it. **Curse of the Wicker Mills Witch -** A Halloween plot of a witches curse that turns people into their costumes. **Daddy Was A...** \- A series of incestuous what if plots that explore a father being various things such as Alien, Super Hero, Time Traveler, Assassin, Bully, Etc. **Daddy Was A Porn Star** \- My favorite variation of the plot with a college-age daughter discovering her father was a porn star before she was born with the name McIroncock as his porn name. Needless to say he is huge and people soon start finding out. **Dagen Darkmane (Character)** \- A muscular dad bod like orc who fucks elves, humans and other fantasy girls until they are happy breeders for his growing tribe. **Dawn of the Breasts** \- A virus turns people into zombimbos. We follow a group of survivors trying to avoid this sexual virus and slowly get picked off/infected one by one. Its like a zombie movie only more erotic and no gore. **Dawn of the Breasts: The New Strain** \- The infection wiped out most of humanity save a few colonies that built massive walls. We fallow a 'survivor' who has been infected but still has sanity and mind unlike the infected. He is a new kind of infected perhaps something better than the zombimbos or humanity. **Domesticated Princess -** Spoiled Princess of a fallen kingdom finds refuge with a former warrior who doesn't take her shit. A stronger focus on romance. **Dream Dad (Character)** \- Your everyday sexy daddy character for you to use. Can also come in Uncle and Big Brother flavor. **End of All Things** \- An end of the world plot focused on demons and angels laying waste to Earth. The lines between good and evil are blurred and humanity suffers. This is a detailed plot with less smut then other plots. **Fall Of An Angel -** Angel is corrupted by a demon in disguise by the time she realizes what he is, her halo is now collar on her neck. **Fallen Hero** \- Generic good man turning bad storyline. Input any favorite character or superhero you love to see become a pervy dom. Restrictions may apply. **Family Camping Trip** \- A family gets away to the remote camping site. Relationships are about to dramatically change. **The Farm: Hucows &amp; Studs** \- A pervy TF plot where people are turned into cows or studs to produce milk on a barn. I know you Hucow girls are out there. **Foxtrot** **(Anthro Plot)** \- Furry characters in Scifi setting where they are space marines fighting a war. Kind of like Starship Troopers, ODST, and Starcraft with anthros. **Fertile Valley** \- A story about a secluded community with tainted water supply by the Church. The more people drink the bigger they get. Men will be hung like horses and women busty like fertility goddesses. **Fertile Valley: Second Cumming** \- A part two-story where a former resident of Fertile Valley starts it all over again only this time the changes come from his altered DNA passed on through his chemically laced cum. **Freeze -** Time stopping watch is to toy with frozen people. The potential is endless. **From The Mist -** Strange supernatural mist covers a small town. Something is inside it. Ask for more details. **The Great White Stud (Character)** \- A dominant white male character for Latinas, Muslims, Asians, Indians, Native Americans and Black girls (White girls too). Lots of fun raceplay plots in her but please be warned if you seem like a racist IRL; KKK, Trump Voter, Neo-Nazi, or \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Supremacist. I will fucking block you. **Holiday Plots** \- Holiday plots come once a year. Ask about Christmas, Easter, and Halloween stories. I have plots for almost every holiday. **Howlin For You** \- Werewolf stories and plots for you to enjoy. You're welcome. **I Love Puazi** \- Orange skinned alien girls with goat eyes migrate to earth. Little do they know how attractive humans are and how addictive cum is for their species. **Infinity Wishes: My Personal Gennie** \- A guy gets a sexy genie and she is now his personal slave/lover/companion. That and she grants unlimited wishes. It's like I Dream of Jeanie only with fucking. **La Resistance** \- A World War 2 story about a resistance group made up of women taking it to the Nazis. It's like Charlie's Angels only in WW2 and there is some fucking between them. Inquire within. **Lost in Space -** A twist on the lost in space setting where a family is stranded in space or on an alien world. Very plot-driven with heavy themes of SciFi. Incest does play into the story eventually. **Man With All The Gifts** \- A man with various emerging abilities becomes a god in his community and potentially the world. Basic male powertrip fantasy but we can always spread out the powers and put limitations. **The Master PC** \- A reality-altering program that allows the user to type in a name and make changes to them in real-time. Now comes in APP form for your smartphone. **Meow Meow** \- A human male living with a few furry females who want to fuck his brains out. Kinda plays out like a sexy/funny sitcom. **Michael Silvermoon (Character)** \- A big bad wolf with a big bad cock. This character is the primary lead for most anthro plots. **Michael McEquus (Character)** \- A big bad horse with even bigger bad cock. This character is a secondary anthro for my anthro stories. **Mistress of the Guard -** Noble female knight (can be a different class/character) is broken down and turned into breeder with soft curves. She starts to enjoy her new life. **My Little Succubus** \- A fun slice of life story about a normal guy living with his demonic girlfriend. Its supposed to be both sweet and perverted.

4,cyber crime,dirtypenpals,"[M4F] Quarantined in California, Bored and Seeking to Write Smut (Mulitple Prompts Inside)",1,g4x83d,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/g4x83d/m4f_quarantined_in_california_bored_and_seeking/,2020-04-21 03:32:24,"# Lockdown Well, the city is on quarantine, I am on paid work leave, and I find myself sitting in front of the PC because my gym is closed and nothing on Netflix appeals to me. My inspiration to write stories has solely been attached to how exciting my partner is. Lackluster, unmotivated, and uninspired players make me feel empty and bored while chatting. I hope to meet someone who excites me. # About Me This is a quick reference for me so you know who you're talking to and can get to know me better. Anything I missed feel free to ask me over Discord if/once we start chatting. * **Straight(ish)** \- I consider myself straight IRL, however, in a story when writing with a FEMALE partner, I am willing to write plots where my character is bisexual. I am pretty much always a top in such stories making the occasional shemale I fuck my sub or any femboy characters suck my cock. * **Dominant** \- I am pretty much always the dominant in my stories. I can get switchy and let a female take control but 99% of the time it will eventually lead me to being in control again. We can discuss this further. * **Looks** \- I am over 6 feet tall, dark brown hair, nice thick beard, green eyes (w/ glasses), broad shoulders, thick arms/legs, and sturdy core, yes, I have abs. I am 34 which means I got some salt in my beard/hair but besides that I got a young face to save the smile lines off the corner of my eyes. Doesn't hurt I have a nice big cock to boot. My only regret is my fair skin and wishing I was taller. I mean... I am bigger than most guys but who wouldn't want to be 6'6? * **Political** \- I Majored in Political Science, Minored in History. I am a political person and in these trying times, I have very little patience for people with MAGA hats or anyone who denies science or newspapers. If you're a Trumpublican, I am not the person you wanna be playing with. P.S. Please vote Democrat, no matter who. * **California Native** \- Knowing this will let you know who my people are and more importantly where my timezone is. It's a pretty fucking awesome state to live in with Surfing and Snowboard a days drive from each other. Not sure why this is important. * **Geeky** \- I love video games, build my own PC, read various books, and collect comics. I just got my first 3D Printer and started to make a proton pack piece by piece. Appeal to my geeky nature if you want my affection. * **Hyper Creative** \- I been writing plots for over 20 years now and a hundred profiles, dozens of characters and thousands of plots. I don't mean to sound braggy but I got a great creative/dirty mind. # About You Consider this a checklist of what I am looking for in a female roleplay companion. Note the top part of the list is a must and the bottom portion is optional. * **Creative** \- Gotta have a creative bone in your body to roleplay. If you cant ask story-related questions then you better be able to answer them. Having a picture of a hot girl as your avatar doesn't mean much to me. * **Geeky** \- Girls who love books, comics, video games, sci-fi/fantasy shows, and more are the best. I love athletic girls but I will take a nerdy girl any day of the week. * **Perverted** \- A cornerstone of a great roleplay is kinky mind. If you got flexible kinks then you're going to do well with me. If you wanna know more about my dirty side let me know I got an F-list for ya. * **Funny** \- I love a person with a sense of humor. Wit goes a long way with me. Spamming a bunch of random memes, however, is not a sign of being witty. * **Progressive** \- I am a progressive and I will be voting for the Democratic nominee (so should you) no matter who it is. If you're a Republican/Trump supporter. It's best we don't play because if/when I find out, I will go off on you for voting for the idiots... I mean Conservatives. * **Friendly** \- I won't ask for personal info (ever) or your name. That said no descriptive info like A/S/L and personal questions like you're favorite music, passions, and dislikes will likely come up. I hope this can grow into a friendship. * **Discord Play** \- It's the only chat worth using. Since you can edit posts, post character pics and make mini servers. * **Multiple Characters** \- My stories often have a cast of characters. We will, of course, have our lead characters but if you only play one female then you're a one-trick pony and that's boring. * **Brainstorming** \- You have to be willing to work with me on building stories. Its a quick turn off when I am answering my own questions, finding all the pics, and making the world/NPC's all by myself. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female that won't cut it for me. If your trans, you can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling it or not. Thanks for understanding * **Picture Sharing (Optional)** \- Not pics of ourselves but character pictures for our story using hentai or real-life models as references. I hope you have a fun porn collection. * **Voice Chat (Optional)** \- I write most of my erotic stories but sometimes planning them goes quickly with a voice chat. It's not mandatory and I won't pressure you but it does move things along and I do have a sexy voice. * **Video Gaming (Optional)** \- I been pairing video games with roleplays lately. Playing a bit of Stardew Valley and then doing a story about two horny farms building a home together. Playing Conan Exiles and then writing a story about two barbarians capturing slaves and building an empire. Inquire if you like. # Original Stories &amp; Characters A list of originalish stories that I have built up over the years.

5,cyber crime,dirtypenpals,[GM4A] 2084,1,g6it0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/g6it0z/gm4a_2084/,2020-04-23 18:12:07," The new millennium felt like it had started well, but it quickly turned downhill. Troubles in the middle east and the resultant major attacks in several western countries was the first major blow, leading to some nasty little wars... the main conflicts finished almost embarassingly quickly, but the core issues lingered with no end in sight. Economies weakened, nationalist and xenophobic political platforms became more successful, trade wars intensified and silent 'cyber wars' became almost commonplace. Covid-19 arrived and the cracks widened. The Inter-African Conflicts followed, and then the Tibetan Escalation. It probably would have turned into world war three, but EBV-32 appeared and the world found out just how nasty viruses could get. The 'Resource Riots' flared up in almost every major country with suspicious coordination, which at least helped to bring a lot of the war efforts to a halt, but they did leave most countries in some level of civil war... That was when the 'Global Alliance' appeared, starting as a humanitarian organisation that funneled desperately needed supplies and medical assistance to hot spots across the globe. Security was of course a problem so they first contracted to various mercenary-like organisations with a seemingly bottomless purse... And then the GA drones appeared. This was a new level of sophistication. The world had already seen weaponised drone aircraft and even some work on robotic pack animal-like assistants for soldiers, but these were something new; fast and effective ground combat systems that were humanoid in shape and could standard rifles and other soldier-borne equipment. Nobody knew quite how they worked, as no enemy force were ever in a position to capture one once they were deployed. The Global Alliance became a political entity, and were instant king-makers in every country they had their eye on. Funding, political support, or even overt military action got them into power and it wasn't long before the jokes about how the 'GA are running things now' became simple truth. Laws started to change. Slowly in some countries, almost instantly in others, things steadily became more draconian. Social media companies were shut down, replaced by the local government's own brand of social media and of course carried by the new government-run telecommunications company... services conveniently provided by GA. Traditional police forces, most of which were already in disarray, vanished and were replaced by GA-supplied policing systems. Power systems, water supplies, transport networks, they all suddenly seemed to have the GA logo at some point in the vital chain. By 2075 the world was at peace again, but nobody from the beginning of the century would recognise it. Most people lived in massive tower blocks, squeezed into tiny apartments. Many people were unemployed, existing on government-provided supplies. Drones patrolled the streets, but there was no need for the old stereotype of being stopped for an ID check... cameras were *everywhere*, and the city security system knew who you were and where you were at all times. It wasn't a good idea to make a fuss. There was a curfew at night, but people who dared to peer out of their little windows might spot one of the black vans that silently sped through the early morning streets. Anyone who stepped out of line would be gone the next day, with someone perhaps whispering to a friend about having seen one of the black vans waiting in the street outside. Of those who *were* employed, there were two kinds. Most working people were 'contractors', typically spending their days in warehouses watching bewilderingly complex machines produce hydroponically grown food, or machine components, or unfathomable black boxes. Pay was generally minimal. The other kind was the 'GA Employee'. They were the new elite, the people you didn't argue with lest you get a black van visit. They had better apartments, they had access to things like cars, they could even command the security drones to a certain degree. There was a hierarchy amongst them as well, of course... roles like 'Building Managers' and 'Contractor HR' being the lowest of the pile, and upper positions like 'Senior Managers' wielding significant power. There were stories and rumors about GA 'Executives', tales of how they lived absolute luxury in massive mansions and had instant life and death control of anyone around them, but few people had seen anyone that might match the claims. People were moved around, usually for completely opaque reasons. A black van might just appear one night, security drones marching in to grab some poor unfortunates, and then they would be delivered somewhere else, in a new apartment usually in a completely different city. Some even claimed to have been *changed* in some way, waking up to signs of surgery on their body, possibly even with their appearance significantly altered. People learned to quietly adapt... the Black Vans were waiting for anyone who complained. In 2080 the War began. There was no official statement about it, nothing in the tightly controlled media, but people were aware of the increased security in the streets, and the surge in manufacturing, and the tension in the faces of the senior GA Employees. Nobody seemed to have any idea of who the enemy might be, or where any fighting was actually taking place. Still, in theory the world was a better place. Everyone was fed, everyone was housed, crime was practically nonexistant, medical services were impeccable, and the entertainment system built into the wall of every apartment provided all the distractions one might need. Yes, *in theory* life was improved, but there was an old adage that still applied... Who watches the watchmen? \--- ""Cassie! Oh *Cassie!*"" Cassandra froze, her heart sinking, her hand still on her apartment door handle. She knew that nasal and smugly imperious voice, everyone did... it was Patrick, the building manager. ""Come here, girl, I have a present for you!"" She turned and walked towards him with heavy resignation. He was an almost stereotypical 'Building Manager'... short, plump, balding, fussy, his GA Employee badge polished to a fine gleam. Not that there was anything wrong with those attributes in particular, she knew lots of very nice men who looked the same... It was what he did with his power that was the stereotypical problem. ""Hello dear,"" he said somewhat greasily, holding out an object wrapped in glossy packaging.. ""Here, look... chocolate! It came in the latest Employee package. I'm sure you'd like some, wouldn't you?"" She knew better than to reject the offering, holding out her hand for it, but as predicted he quickly drew it away, smiling at her. ""I think one good turn deserves another, don't you? I mean I thought of you the moment I saw the chocolate. I was hoping for one of your *kindnesses* in return. How is your father, by the way? Feeling better?"" The threat was clear. Do what he wanted, or her father might be the next person visited by security late at night. Everyone knew what a 'kindness' meant. She nodded wordlessly, gaze lowered, and then got down on her knees. The unzipping of his trousers was loud in the hall, and she didn't hesitate before leaning in to take his cock in her mouth. His hands immediately went to her head and she had to concentrate on breathing and not gagging as he thrust himself into her throat and started humping. There was the click of another apartment door opening, and she desperately tried to identify the owner of the footsteps that passed, but she couldn't tell. Patrick ignored the other person, breathing heavily as he approached his climax. Finally he pulled out of her mouth, fingers tight in her hair as he forcefully tilted her head back. The soft splat of his cum streaking her face made her flinch briefly, but she otherwise remained carefully still with her eyes closed until he let go. ""Very good dear,"" he said breathlessly. "" I have more treats waiting if you ever feel like visiting and doing me another kindness. Here..."" The wrapped chocolate was dropped on the ground in front of her. ""Yes, that definitely looks good on you. Don't wipe it off. I'm sure everyone will like to see how kind you are."" He chuckled and turned away, heading back to his own larger apartment. She didn't move until his footsteps faded, then grabbed the chocolate and clambered to her feet. She kept her head down as she hurried towards the stairs. She could feel the cum dripping from her chin, but she didn't dare wipe her face until she was well away from the building's own security cameras. It was horribly humiliating, but anyone who saw her would probably understand. The new world was full of people like Patrick... or worse. \---\~\~\~\*\*\*\~\~\~--- *Wanted: Someone to explore a mysterious and darkly corrupt dystopian future.* *For the aesthetic, imagine a blend of something like HalfLife 2, and just-pre-collapse USSR, perhaps a hint of Papers Please, a dash of Equilibrium and smattering of V for Vendetta.* *I'm looking for complex and interesting characters, particularly with an idea of where their progression should go.

6,cyber crime,dirtypenpals,"[M4F] Quarantined in California, Bored and Seeking to Write Smut (Mulitple Prompts Inside)",1,g7h3yt,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/g7h3yt/m4f_quarantined_in_california_bored_and_seeking/,2020-04-25 07:32:15,"# Lockdown Well, the city is on quarantine, I am on paid work leave, and I find myself sitting in front of the PC because my gym is closed and nothing on Netflix appeals to me. My inspiration to write stories has solely been attached to how exciting my partner is. Lackluster, unmotivated, and uninspired players make me feel empty and bored while chatting. I hope to meet someone who excites me. # About Me This is a quick reference for me so you know who you're talking to and can get to know me better. Anything I missed feel free to ask me over Discord if/once we start chatting. * **Straight(ish)** \- I consider myself straight IRL, however, in a story when writing with a FEMALE partner, I am willing to write plots where my character is bisexual. I am pretty much always a top in such stories making the occasional shemale I fuck my sub or any femboy characters suck my cock. * **Dominant** \- I am pretty much always the dominant in my stories. I can get switchy and let a female take control but 99% of the time it will eventually lead me to being in control again. We can discuss this further. * **Looks** \- I am over 6 feet tall, dark brown hair, nice thick beard, green eyes (w/ glasses), broad shoulders, thick arms/legs, and sturdy core, yes, I have abs. I am 34 which means I got some salt in my beard/hair but besides that I got a young face to save the smile lines off the corner of my eyes. Doesn't hurt I have a nice big cock to boot. My only regret is my fair skin and wishing I was taller. I mean... I am bigger than most guys but who wouldn't want to be 6'6? * **Political** \- I Majored in Political Science, Minored in History. I am a political person and in these trying times, I have very little patience for people with MAGA hats or anyone who denies science or newspapers. If you're a Trumpublican, I am not the person you wanna be playing with. P.S. Please vote Democrat, no matter who. * **California Native** \- Knowing this will let you know who my people are and more importantly where my timezone is. It's a pretty fucking awesome state to live in with Surfing and Snowboard a days drive from each other. Not sure why this is important. * **Geeky** \- I love video games, build my own PC, read various books, and collect comics. I just got my first 3D Printer and started to make a proton pack piece by piece. Appeal to my geeky nature if you want my affection. * **Hyper Creative** \- I been writing plots for over 20 years now and a hundred profiles, dozens of characters and thousands of plots. I don't mean to sound braggy but I got a great creative/dirty mind. # About You Consider this a checklist of what I am looking for in a female roleplay companion. Note the top part of the list is a must and the bottom portion is optional. * **Creative** \- Gotta have a creative bone in your body to roleplay. If you cant ask story-related questions then you better be able to answer them. Having a picture of a hot girl as your avatar doesn't mean much to me. * **Geeky** \- Girls who love books, comics, video games, sci-fi/fantasy shows, and more are the best. I love athletic girls but I will take a nerdy girl any day of the week. * **Perverted** \- A cornerstone of a great roleplay is kinky mind. If you got flexible kinks then you're going to do well with me. If you wanna know more about my dirty side let me know I got an F-list for ya. * **Funny** \- I love a person with a sense of humor. Wit goes a long way with me. Spamming a bunch of random memes, however, is not a sign of being witty. * **Progressive** \- I am a progressive and I will be voting for the Democratic nominee (so should you) no matter who it is. If you're a Republican/Trump supporter. It's best we don't play because if/when I find out, I will go off on you for voting for the idiots... I mean Conservatives. * **Friendly** \- I won't ask for personal info (ever) or your name. That said no descriptive info like A/S/L and personal questions like you're favorite music, passions, and dislikes will likely come up. I hope this can grow into a friendship. * **Discord Play** \- It's the only chat worth using. Since you can edit posts, post character pics and make mini servers. * **Multiple Characters** \- My stories often have a cast of characters. We will, of course, have our lead characters but if you only play one female then you're a one-trick pony and that's boring. * **Brainstorming** \- You have to be willing to work with me on building stories. Its a quick turn off when I am answering my own questions, finding all the pics, and making the world/NPC's all by myself. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female that won't cut it for me. If your trans, you can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling it or not. Thanks for understanding * **Picture Sharing (Optional)** \- Not pics of ourselves but character pictures for our story using hentai or real-life models as references. I hope you have a fun porn collection. * **Voice Chat (Optional)** \- I write most of my erotic stories but sometimes planning them goes quickly with a voice chat. It's not mandatory and I won't pressure you but it does move things along and I do have a sexy voice. * **Video Gaming (Optional)** \- I been pairing video games with roleplays lately. Playing a bit of Stardew Valley and then doing a story about two horny farms building a home together. Playing Conan Exiles and then writing a story about two barbarians capturing slaves and building an empire. Inquire if you like. # Original Stories &amp; Characters A list of originalish stories that I have built up over the years. Some come from erotic fiction I read in the past, others I just developed on my own.

Normally this is anthro story, however, it can be easily tweaked to have human characters. **Big Cock Bully (Character)** \- A character type with a mean bully type stealing away beautiful women from another man. I have various sub-personalities that click into this character to change the type of bully he is. **Body Shifters Universe** \- Shapeshifting alien females that can look like anyone woman come to earth to live on our world.

I have many subplots for this setting. **Clipped** \- A strange alien item is attached to a person and has strange effects. **The Collector: Waifu Harem** \- A impossible plot about a man who can travel between worlds and collect the hottest of women to become his personal harem. **Conques &amp; Corruption** \- A generic fallen castle story where a Kingdom (usually full of women) falls to an enemy force of brutal hung warriors who use them after the battle is over. **Cryptozoology** \- A fun setting where we explore a group of scientists/explorers who find hidden beasts across the world.

Its like a zombie movie only more erotic and no gore. **Dawn of the Breasts: The New Strain** \- The infection wiped out most of humanity save a few colonies that built massive walls.

He is a new kind of infected perhaps something better than the zombimbos or humanity. **Domesticated Princess -** Spoiled Princess of a fallen kingdom finds refuge with a former warrior who doesn't take her shit. A stronger focus on romance. **Dream Dad (Character)** \- Your everyday sexy daddy character for you to use. Can also come in Uncle and Big Brother flavor. **End of All Things** \- An end of the world plot focused on demons and angels laying waste to Earth. The lines between good and evil are blurred and humanity suffers. This is a detailed plot with less smut then other plots. **Fall Of An Angel -** Angel is corrupted by a demon in disguise by the time she realizes what he is, her halo is now collar on her neck. **Fallen Hero** \- Generic good man turning bad storyline.

Kind of like Starship Troopers, ODST, and Starcraft with anthros. **Fertile Valley** \- A story about a secluded community with tainted water supply by the Church. The more people drink the bigger they get. Men will be hung like horses and women busty like fertility goddesses. **Fertile Valley: Second Cumming** \- A part two-story where a former resident of Fertile Valley starts it all over again only this time the changes come from his altered DNA passed on through his chemically laced cum. **Freeze -** Time stopping watch is to toy with frozen people.

Ask for more details. **The Great White Stud (Character)** \- A dominant white male character for Latinas, Muslims, Asians, Indians, Native Americans and Black girls (White girls too). Lots of fun raceplay plots in her but please be warned if you seem like a racist IRL; KKK, Trump Voter, Neo-Nazi, or \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Supremacist. I will fucking block you. **Holiday Plots** \- Holiday plots come once a year. Ask about Christmas, Easter, and Halloween stories. I have plots for almost every holiday. **Howlin For You** \- Werewolf stories and plots for you to enjoy. You're welcome. **I Love Puazi** \- Orange skinned alien girls with goat eyes migrate to earth. Little do they know how attractive humans are and how addictive cum is for their species. **Infinity Wishes: My Personal Gennie** \- A guy gets a sexy genie and she is now his personal slave/lover/companion. That and she grants unlimited wishes. It's like I Dream of Jeanie only with fucking. **La Resistance** \- A World War 2 story about a resistance group made up of women taking it to the Nazis. It's like Charlie's Angels only in WW2 and there is some fucking between them. Inquire within. **Lost in Space -** A twist on the lost in space setting where a family is stranded in space or on an alien world. Very plot-driven with heavy themes of SciFi. Incest does play into the story eventually. **Man With All The Gifts** \- A man with various emerging abilities becomes a god in his community and potentially the world. Basic male powertrip fantasy but we can always spread out the powers and put limitations. **The Master PC** \- A reality-altering program that allows the user to type in a name and make changes to them in real-time. Now comes in APP form for your smartphone. **Meow Meow** \- A human male living with a few furry females who want to fuck his brains out.

7,cyber crime,dirtypenpals,"[M4F] Quarantined in California, Bored and Seeking to Write Smut (Mulitple Prompts Inside)",1,gbk3ku,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/gbk3ku/m4f_quarantined_in_california_bored_and_seeking/,2020-05-02 01:23:05,"# Lockdown Well, the city is on quarantine, I am on paid work leave, and I find myself sitting in front of the PC because my gym is closed and nothing on Netflix appeals to me. My inspiration to write stories has solely been attached to how exciting my partner is. Lackluster, unmotivated, and uninspired players make me feel empty and bored while chatting. I hope to meet someone who excites me. # About Me This is a quick reference for me so you know who you're talking to and can get to know me better. Anything I missed feel free to ask me over Discord if/once we start chatting. * **Straight(ish)** \- I consider myself straight IRL, however, in a story when writing with a FEMALE partner, I am willing to write plots where my character is bisexual. I am pretty much always a top in such stories making the occasional shemale I fuck my sub or any femboy characters suck my cock. * **Dominant** \- I am pretty much always the dominant in my stories. I can get switchy and let a female take control but 99% of the time it will eventually lead me to being in control again. We can discuss this further. * **Looks** \- I am over 6 feet tall, dark brown hair, nice thick beard, green eyes (w/ glasses), broad shoulders, thick arms/legs, and sturdy core, yes, I have abs. I am 34 which means I got some salt in my beard/hair but besides that I got a young face to save the smile lines off the corner of my eyes. Doesn't hurt I have a nice big cock to boot. My only regret is my fair skin and wishing I was taller. I mean... I am bigger than most guys but who wouldn't want to be 6'6? * **Political** \- I Majored in Political Science, Minored in History. I am a political person and in these trying times, I have very little patience for people with MAGA hats or anyone who denies science or newspapers. If you're a Trumpublican, I am not the person you wanna be playing with. P.S. Please vote Democrat, no matter who. * **California Native** \- Knowing this will let you know who my people are and more importantly where my timezone is. It's a pretty fucking awesome state to live in with Surfing and Snowboard a days drive from each other. Not sure why this is important. * **Geeky** \- I love video games, build my own PC, read various books, and collect comics. I just got my first 3D Printer and started to make a proton pack piece by piece. Appeal to my geeky nature if you want my affection. * **Hyper Creative** \- I been writing plots for over 20 years now and a hundred profiles, dozens of characters and thousands of plots. I don't mean to sound braggy but I got a great creative/dirty mind. # About You Consider this a checklist of what I am looking for in a female roleplay companion. Note the top part of the list is a must and the bottom portion is optional. * **Creative** \- Gotta have a creative bone in your body to roleplay. If you cant ask story-related questions then you better be able to answer them. Having a picture of a hot girl as your avatar doesn't mean much to me. * **Geeky** \- Girls who love books, comics, video games, sci-fi/fantasy shows, and more are the best. I love athletic girls but I will take a nerdy girl any day of the week. * **Perverted** \- A cornerstone of a great roleplay is kinky mind. If you got flexible kinks then you're going to do well with me. If you wanna know more about my dirty side let me know I got an F-list for ya. * **Funny** \- I love a person with a sense of humor. Wit goes a long way with me. Spamming a bunch of random memes, however, is not a sign of being witty. * **Progressive** \- I am a progressive and I will be voting for the Democratic nominee (so should you) no matter who it is. If you're a Republican/Trump supporter. It's best we don't play because if/when I find out, I will go off on you for voting for the idiots... I mean Conservatives. * **Friendly** \- I won't ask for personal info (ever) or your name. That said no descriptive info like A/S/L and personal questions like you're favorite music, passions, and dislikes will likely come up. I hope this can grow into a friendship. * **Discord Play** \- It's the only chat worth using. Since you can edit posts, post character pics and make mini servers. * **Multiple Characters** \- My stories often have a cast of characters. We will, of course, have our lead characters but if you only play one female then you're a one-trick pony and that's boring. * **Brainstorming** \- You have to be willing to work with me on building stories. Its a quick turn off when I am answering my own questions, finding all the pics, and making the world/NPC's all by myself. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female that won't cut it for me. If your trans, you can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling it or not. Thanks for understanding * **Picture Sharing (Optional)** \- Not pics of ourselves but character pictures for our story using hentai or real-life models as references. I hope you have a fun porn collection. * **Voice Chat (Optional)** \- I write most of my erotic stories but sometimes planning them goes quickly with a voice chat. It's not mandatory and I won't pressure you but it does move things along and I do have a sexy voice. * **Video Gaming (Optional)** \- I been pairing video games with roleplays lately. Playing a bit of Stardew Valley and then doing a story about two horny farms building a home together. Playing Conan Exiles and then writing a story about two barbarians capturing slaves and building an empire. Inquire if you like. # Original Stories &amp; Characters A list of originalish stories that I have built up over the years.

8,cyber crime,dirtypenpals,"[M4F] Quarantined in the Bay Area, Bored and Seeking to Write (Mulitple Prompts Inside)",1,fod75l,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fod75l/m4f_quarantined_in_the_bay_area_bored_and_seeking/,2020-03-25 08:06:36,"# Lockdown Well, the city is on quarantine, I am on paid work leave, and I find myself sitting in front of the PC because my gym is closed and nothing on Netflix appeals to me. My inspiration to write stories has solely been attached to how exciting my partner is. Lackluster, unmotivated, and uninspired players make me feel empty and bored while chatting. I hope to meet someone who excites me. # About Me This is a quick reference for me so you know who you're talking to and can get to know me better. Anything I missed feel free to ask me over Discord if/once we start chatting. * **Straight(ish)** \- I consider myself straight IRL, however, in a story when writing with a FEMALE partner, I am willing to write plots where my character is bisexual. I am pretty much always a top in such stories making the occasional shemale I fuck my sub or any femboy characters suck my cock. * **Dominant** \- I am pretty much always the dominant in my stories. I can get switchy and let a female take control but 99% of the time it will eventually lead me to being in control again. We can discuss this further. * **Looks** \- I am over 6 feet tall, dark brown hair, nice thick beard, green eyes (w/ glasses), broad shoulders, thick arms/legs, and sturdy core, yes, I have abs. I am 34 which means I got some salt in my beard/hair but besides that I got a young face to save the smile lines off the corner of my eyes. Doesn't hurt I have a nice big cock to boot. My only regret is my fair skin and wishing I was taller. I mean... I am bigger than most guys but who wouldn't want to be 6'6? * **Political** \- I Majored in Political Science, Minored in History. I am a political person and in these trying times, I have very little patience for people with MAGA hats or anyone who denies science or newspapers. If you're a Trumpublican, I am not the person you wanna be playing with. P.S. Please vote Democrat, no matter who. * **California Native** \- Knowing this will let you know who my people are and more importantly where my timezone is. It's a pretty fucking awesome state to live in with Surfing and Snowboard a days drive from each other. Not sure why this is important. * **Geeky** \- I love video games, build my own PC, read various books, and collect comics. I just got my first 3D Printer and started to make a proton pack piece by piece. Appeal to my geeky nature if you want my affection. * **Hyper Creative** \- I been writing plots for over 20 years now and a hundred profiles, dozens of characters and thousands of plots. I don't mean to sound braggy but I got a great creative/dirty mind. # About You Consider this a checklist of what I am looking for in a female roleplay companion. Note the top part of the list is a must and the bottom portion is optional. * **Creative** \- Gotta have a creative bone in your body to roleplay. If you cant ask story-related questions then you better be able to answer them. Having a picture of a hot girl as your avatar doesn't mean much to me. * **Geeky** \- Girls who love books, comics, video games, sci-fi/fantasy shows, and more are the best. I love athletic girls but I will take a nerdy girl any day of the week. * **Perverted** \- A cornerstone of a great roleplay is kinky mind. If you got flexible kinks then you're going to do well with me. If you wanna know more about my dirty side let me know I got an F-list for ya. * **Funny** \- I love a person with a sense of humor. Wit goes a long way with me. Spamming a bunch of random memes, however, is not a sign of being witty. * **Progressive** \- I am a progressive and I will be voting for the Democratic nominee (so should you) no matter who it is. If you're a Republican/Trump supporter. It's best we don't play because if/when I find out, I will go off on you for voting for the idiots... I mean Conservatives. * **Friendly** \- I won't ask for personal info (ever) or your name. That said no descriptive info like A/S/L and personal questions like you're favorite music, passions, and dislikes will likely come up. I hope this can grow into a friendship. * **Discord Play** \- It's the only chat worth using. Since you can edit posts, post character pics and make mini servers. * **Multiple Characters** \- My stories often have a cast of characters. We will, of course, have our lead characters but if you only play one female then you're a one-trick pony and that's boring. * **Brainstorming** \- You have to be willing to work with me on building stories. Its a quick turn off when I am answering my own questions, finding all the pics, and making the world/NPC's all by myself. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female that won't cut it for me. If your trans, you can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling it or not. Thanks for understanding * **Picture Sharing (Optional)** \- Not pics of ourselves but character pictures for our story using hentai or real-life models as references. I hope you have a fun porn collection. * **Voice Chat (Optional)** \- I write most of my erotic stories but sometimes planning them goes quickly with a voice chat. It's not mandatory and I won't pressure you but it does move things along and I do have a sexy voice. * **Video Gaming (Optional)** \- I been pairing video games with roleplays lately. Playing a bit of Stardew Valley and then doing a story about two horny farms building a home together. Playing Conan Exiles and then writing a story about two barbarians capturing slaves and building an empire. Inquire if you like. # Original Stories &amp; Characters A list of originalish stories that I have built up over the years.

The story has themes of strategy, blackmail, mind control, and harem play. **Only We Remain** \- A zombie story where the infected are infested by a fungal virus (like the Last of US).

Insanely hard to roleplay and serves best as inspiration. **Serial** **~~Killer~~** **Fucker -** A villain is running around town 'killing' coeds.

My inspiration to write stories has solely been attached to how exciting my partner is. Lackluster, unmotivated, and uninspired players make me feel empty and bored while chatting. I hope to meet someone who excites me. # About Me This is a quick reference for me so you know who you're talking to and can get to know me better. Anything I missed feel free to ask me over Discord if/once we start chatting. * **Straight(ish)** \- I consider myself straight IRL, however, in a story when writing with a FEMALE partner, I am willing to write plots where my character is bisexual. I am pretty much always a top in such stories making the occasional shemale I fuck my sub or any femboy characters suck my cock. * **Dominant** \- I am pretty much always the dominant in my stories. I can get switchy and let a female take control but 99% of the time it will eventually lead me to being in control again. We can discuss this further. * **Looks** \- I am over 6 feet tall, dark brown hair, nice thick beard, green eyes (w/ glasses), broad shoulders, thick arms/legs, and sturdy core, yes, I have abs. I am 34 which means I got some salt in my beard/hair but besides that I got a young face to save the smile lines off the corner of my eyes. Doesn't hurt I have a nice big cock to boot. My only regret is my fair skin and wishing I was taller. I mean... I am bigger than most guys but who wouldn't want to be 6'6? * **Political** \- I Majored in Political Science, Minored in History. I am a political person and in these trying times, I have very little patience for people with MAGA hats or anyone who denies science or newspapers. If you're a Trumpublican, I am not the person you wanna be playing with. P.S. Please vote Democrat, no matter who. * **California Native** \- Knowing this will let you know who my people are and more importantly where my timezone is. It's a pretty fucking awesome state to live in with Surfing and Snowboard a days drive from each other. Not sure why this is important. * **Geeky** \- I love video games, build my own PC, read various books, and collect comics. I just got my first 3D Printer and started to make a proton pack piece by piece. Appeal to my geeky nature if you want my affection. * **Hyper Creative** \- I been writing plots for over 20 years now and a hundred profiles, dozens of characters and thousands of plots. I don't mean to sound braggy but I got a great creative/dirty mind. # About You Consider this a checklist of what I am looking for in a female roleplay companion. Note the top part of the list is a must and the bottom portion is optional. * **Creative** \- Gotta have a creative bone in your body to roleplay. If you cant ask story-related questions then you better be able to answer them. Having a picture of a hot girl as your avatar doesn't mean much to me. * **Geeky** \- Girls who love books, comics, video games, sci-fi/fantasy shows, and more are the best. I love athletic girls but I will take a nerdy girl any day of the week. * **Perverted** \- A cornerstone of a great roleplay is kinky mind. If you got flexible kinks then you're going to do well with me. If you wanna know more about my dirty side let me know I got an F-list for ya. * **Funny** \- I love a person with a sense of humor. Wit goes a long way with me. Spamming a bunch of random memes, however, is not a sign of being witty. * **Progressive** \- I am a progressive and I will be voting for the Democratic nominee (so should you) no matter who it is. If you're a Republican/Trump supporter. It's best we don't play because if/when I find out, I will go off on you for voting for the idiots... I mean Conservatives. * **Friendly** \- I won't ask for personal info (ever) or your name. That said no descriptive info like A/S/L and personal questions like you're favorite music, passions, and dislikes will likely come up. I hope this can grow into a friendship. * **Discord Play** \- It's the only chat worth using. Since you can edit posts, post character pics and make mini servers. * **Multiple Characters** \- My stories often have a cast of characters. We will, of course, have our lead characters but if you only play one female then you're a one-trick pony and that's boring. * **Brainstorming** \- You have to be willing to work with me on building stories. Its a quick turn off when I am answering my own questions, finding all the pics, and making the world/NPC's all by myself. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female that won't cut it for me. If your trans, you can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling it or not. Thanks for understanding * **Picture Sharing (Optional)** \- Not pics of ourselves but character pictures for our story using hentai or real-life models as references. I hope you have a fun porn collection. * **Voice Chat (Optional)** \- I write most of my erotic stories but sometimes planning them goes quickly with a voice chat. It's not mandatory and I won't pressure you but it does move things along and I do have a sexy voice. * **Video Gaming (Optional)** \- I been pairing video games with roleplays lately. Playing a bit of Stardew Valley and then doing a story about two horny farms building a home together. Playing Conan Exiles and then writing a story about two barbarians capturing slaves and building an empire. Inquire if you like. # Original Stories &amp; Characters A list of originalish stories that I have built up over the years.

Insanely hard to roleplay and serves best as inspiration. **Serial** **~~Killer~~** **Fucker -** A villain is running around town 'killing' coeds.

My inspiration to write stories has solely been attached to how exciting my partner is. Lackluster, unmotivated, and uninspired players make me feel empty and bored while chatting. I hope to meet someone who excites me. # About Me This is a quick reference for me so you know who you're talking to and can get to know me better. Anything I missed feel free to ask me over Discord if/once we start chatting. * **Straight(ish)** \- I consider myself straight IRL, however, in a story when writing with a FEMALE partner, I am willing to write plots where my character is bisexual. I am pretty much always a top in such stories making the occasional shemale I fuck my sub or any femboy characters suck my cock. * **Dominant** \- I am pretty much always the dominant in my stories. I can get switchy and let a female take control but 99% of the time it will eventually lead me to being in control again. We can discuss this further. * **Looks** \- I am over 6 feet tall, dark brown hair, nice thick beard, green eyes (w/ glasses), broad shoulders, thick arms/legs, and sturdy core, yes, I have abs. I am 34 which means I got some salt in my beard/hair but besides that I got a young face to save the smile lines off the corner of my eyes. Doesn't hurt I have a nice big cock to boot. My only regret is my fair skin and wishing I was taller. I mean... I am bigger than most guys but who wouldn't want to be 6'6? * **Political** \- I Majored in Political Science, Minored in History. I am a political person and in these trying times, I have very little patience for people with MAGA hats or anyone who denies science or newspapers. If you're a Trumpublican, I am not the person you wanna be playing with. P.S. Please vote Democrat, no matter who. * **California Native** \- Knowing this will let you know who my people are and more importantly where my timezone is. It's a pretty fucking awesome state to live in with Surfing and Snowboard a days drive from each other. Not sure why this is important. * **Geeky** \- I love video games, build my own PC, read various books, and collect comics. I just got my first 3D Printer and started to make a proton pack piece by piece. Appeal to my geeky nature if you want my affection. * **Hyper Creative** \- I been writing plots for over 20 years now and a hundred profiles, dozens of characters and thousands of plots. I don't mean to sound braggy but I got a great creative/dirty mind. # About You Consider this a checklist of what I am looking for in a female roleplay companion. Note the top part of the list is a must and the bottom portion is optional. * **Creative** \- Gotta have a creative bone in your body to roleplay. If you cant ask story-related questions then you better be able to answer them. Having a picture of a hot girl as your avatar doesn't mean much to me. * **Geeky** \- Girls who love books, comics, video games, sci-fi/fantasy shows, and more are the best. I love athletic girls but I will take a nerdy girl any day of the week. * **Perverted** \- A cornerstone of a great roleplay is kinky mind. If you got flexible kinks then you're going to do well with me. If you wanna know more about my dirty side let me know I got an F-list for ya. * **Funny** \- I love a person with a sense of humor. Wit goes a long way with me. Spamming a bunch of random memes, however, is not a sign of being witty. * **Progressive** \- I am a progressive and I will be voting for the Democratic nominee (so should you) no matter who it is. If you're a Republican/Trump supporter. It's best we don't play because if/when I find out, I will go off on you for voting for the idiots... I mean Conservatives. * **Friendly** \- I won't ask for personal info (ever) or your name. That said no descriptive info like A/S/L and personal questions like you're favorite music, passions, and dislikes will likely come up. I hope this can grow into a friendship. * **Discord Play** \- It's the only chat worth using. Since you can edit posts, post character pics and make mini servers. * **Multiple Characters** \- My stories often have a cast of characters. We will, of course, have our lead characters but if you only play one female then you're a one-trick pony and that's boring. * **Brainstorming** \- You have to be willing to work with me on building stories. Its a quick turn off when I am answering my own questions, finding all the pics, and making the world/NPC's all by myself. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female that won't cut it for me. If your trans, you can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling it or not. Thanks for understanding * **Picture Sharing (Optional)** \- Not pics of ourselves but character pictures for our story using hentai or real-life models as references. I hope you have a fun porn collection. * **Voice Chat (Optional)** \- I write most of my erotic stories but sometimes planning them goes quickly with a voice chat. It's not mandatory and I won't pressure you but it does move things along and I do have a sexy voice. * **Video Gaming (Optional)** \- I been pairing video games with roleplays lately. Playing a bit of Stardew Valley and then doing a story about two horny farms building a home together. Playing Conan Exiles and then writing a story about two barbarians capturing slaves and building an empire. Inquire if you like. # Original Stories &amp; Characters A list of originalish stories that I have built up over the years. Some come from erotic fiction I read in the past, others I just developed on my own.

It's like Charlie's Angels only in WW2 and there is some fucking between them. Inquire within. **Lost in Space -** A twist on the lost in space setting where a family is stranded in space or on an alien world. Very plot-driven with heavy themes of SciFi. Incest does play into the story eventually. **Man With All The Gifts** \- A man with various emerging abilities becomes a god in his community and potentially the world. Basic male powertrip fantasy but we can always spread out the powers and put limitations. **The Master PC** \- A reality-altering program that allows the user to type in a name and make changes to them in real-time.

The story has themes of strategy, blackmail, mind control, and harem play. **Only We Remain** \- A zombie story where the infected are infested by a fungal virus (like the Last of US).

It's to complex to explain in a note so ask for more details. **Only We Remain: Reclamation** \- Zombie survival plot but focused on Celebs being saved by soldiers and then used sexually by said soldier studs. I can elaborate more. **Pandora's Reckoning** \- A randomizing curse that alters people into strange bodies IE Centaurs, Anthros, Elves, Nagas, Etc. **The Raven Manor** \- A mansion full of monster girls protected by human steward who cares for all of them.

Insanely hard to roleplay and serves best as inspiration. **Serial** **~~Killer~~** **Fucker -** A villain is running around town 'killing' coeds.

Having a picture of a hot girl as your avatar doesn't mean much to me. * **Geeky** \- Girls who love books, comics, video games, sci-fi/fantasy shows, and more are the best. I love athletic girls but I will take a nerdy girl any day of the week. * **Perverted** \- A cornerstone of a great roleplay is kinky mind. If you got flexible kinks then you're going to do well with me. If you wanna know more about my dirty side let me know I got an F-list for ya. * **Funny** \- I love a person with a sense of humor. Wit goes a long way with me. Spamming a bunch of random memes, however, is not a sign of being witty. * **Progressive** \- I am a progressive and I will be voting for the Democratic nominee (so should you) no matter who it is. If you're a Republican/Trump supporter. It's best we don't play because if/when I find out, I will go off on you for voting for the idiots... I mean Conservatives. * **Friendly** \- I won't ask for personal info (ever) or your name. That said no descriptive info like A/S/L and personal questions like you're favorite music, passions, and dislikes will likely come up. I hope this can grow into a friendship. * **Discord Play** \- It's the only chat worth using. Since you can edit posts, post character pics and make mini servers. * **Multiple Characters** \- My stories often have a cast of characters. We will, of course, have our lead characters but if you only play one female then you're a one-trick pony and that's boring. * **Brainstorming** \- You have to be willing to work with me on building stories. Its a quick turn off when I am answering my own questions, finding all the pics, and making the world/NPC's all by myself. * **True Female Players** \- It should be noted I prefer female players. If you're a male playing a female that won't cut it for me. If your trans, you can ask and I will let you know if I am feeling it or not. Thanks for understanding * **Picture Sharing (Optional)** \- Not pics of ourselves but character pictures for our story using hentai or real-life models as references. I hope you have a fun porn collection. * **Voice Chat (Optional)** \- I write most of my erotic stories but sometimes planning them goes quickly with a voice chat. It's not mandatory and I won't pressure you but it does move things along and I do have a sexy voice. * **Video Gaming (Optional)** \- I been pairing video games with roleplays lately. Playing a bit of Stardew Valley and then doing a story about two horny farms building a home together. Playing Conan Exiles and then writing a story about two barbarians capturing slaves and building an empire. Inquire if you like. # Original Stories &amp; Characters A list of originalish stories that I have built up over the years.

It's like Charlie's Angels only in WW2 and there is some fucking between them.

The story has themes of strategy, blackmail, mind control, and harem play. **Only We Remain** \- A zombie story where the infected are infested by a fungal virus (like the Last of US).

It's to complex to explain in a note so ask for more details. **Only We Remain: Reclamation** \- Zombie survival plot but focused on Celebs being saved by soldiers and then used sexually by said soldier studs. I can elaborate more. **Pandora's Reckoning** \- A randomizing curse that alters people into strange bodies IE Centaurs, Anthros, Elves, Nagas, Etc. **The Raven Manor** \- A mansion full of monster girls protected by human steward who cares for all of them.

Insanely hard to roleplay and serves best as inspiration. **Serial** **~~Killer~~** **Fucker -** A villain is running around town 'killing' coeds. By killing I mean stalking, chasing, ravaging and fucking them so hard their brains go bye bye. Kind of a weird take on the horror movie genres. **The Sleepover -** A bunch of college girls have a sleepover and begin to fantasize about the men of the house. **Spells R Us** \- A small magical shop selling items with weird sexual curses. Some help people, others teach the person a valuable lesson.

12,cyber crime,dirtypenpals,[GM4FFF]Cyber Punk Space Role-play [multiple players],1,ekxfw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/ekxfw9/gm4fffcyber_punk_space_roleplay_multiple_players/,2020-01-07 04:45:01,"Male GM looking for 2-4 female players who would like to roleplay a sort of sexy space crew adventure (like Firefly or the Mandolorian, but with more sex). This is for a long term role-play. Set in a cyberpunk future in the outskirts of the galaxy, where the law isn't as pervasive and things like sex, gambling, and drugs are everywhere. You could be a group of bounty hunters, smugglers, prostitutes or a heist crew or a mixed up grab bag of women just trying to make it to the next job. I'm ideally wanting to do this over discord, via voice chat preferred, but we can also do it over text. I'm thinking meeting once a week or once every two weeks (whatever we can work out given schedules). I am on central time so maybe thinking playing Mon-Thrus during the evening for me most likely times, but it would all depend on when everyone is free. Kink/limit wise I am thinking since there will be a lot of people to keep it more vanilla (sexy outfits, domination, submission, exhibitionism, light bondage etc being okay while incest, ageplay, beastiality and toilet stuff are out), though because of the criminal and drug use aspect I am thinking of dub con/non con being part of it but again that will be dependent on who joins. Also since this is a crew of women who might want to connect with each other, possibly being okay with male and female partners for sex scenes might be your best bet (but not required). Also for the sake of trying to make something that can include a lot of people I'm leaving aliens off the table, so everything will be human characters and sex scenes. This roleplay will also have some simple stat systems for things like physical, mental, social, and sexual abilities (I might make it more complex depending on the players wishes) and ship stats as well. If you are interested (it might take me a little while to get back to you if you message me) message me with the following: -what character roles you would be interested in playing -what time zone you are in -what days of the weeks/times would be best for you -if you want to do this over text or voice on discord -any issues with the kinks/limits I talked about above (and if there is any kink or limit you particularly want included or not included) -if you are okay with both male and female partners for sex scenes or only prefer one or the other If you are interested here are some possible ideas for character roles, feel free to pick one, make up your own or expand upon any idea I offer (the main thing is I am thinking no matter what you choose that it be you are just starting out at it, not already established, so if you pick a bounty hunter you are a fairly new one not the universe's best bounty hunter) Possible Roles you can play (or feel free to make up one or combine some together) The Fighter - a mix of MMA fighting and oil wrestling, the fights are one of the most popular events to watch and wager on. Serious fighting with a dash of sexual spectacle combine to entertain fans and gamblers alike. Youll have a stage persona and will work your way through amateur matches to the big leagues. Expect to have offers to throw fights from local crime lords, the occasional obsessed fan, and your uniform to not make it through every fight in one piece. The Enforcer - bodyguard for hire, leg breaker for loansharks, or simple mercenary. Youre job is to have the muscle and big guns. Expect to be the lead in gunfights, be protector of the crew, and chase down anyone who might owe money. The Gambler - maybe youre a card sharp, maybe youre a bookie, maybe youre just a degenerate who blows through your credits faster than you can earn them. You are a mainstay at the race tracks, card tables, gambling dens, and oil fights. Youll tend to know where the action is and maybe who to bet on. If you are lucky you might keep the crew afloat, if not you might be the reason that loansharks are hounding you from system to system. The Pusher - you are a simple drug dealer, selling depressants, stimulants, and hallucinogens at hugely marked up prices. Expect to start small before working your way up to wholesale. Some systems are strict on drug trafficking, others more lenient, so you may have to be extra careful depending where you are. Whether you make it a habit to go back to your customers homes and share the goods you just sold them is up to you. The Racer - hover bike racing is the other big draw for gamblers and fans across the universe. Start in the beginners circuits and work your way to the big time if you can get a fast enough bike that is. You can earn quite a bit betting on yourself if you are fast enough, but many races will pit you against members of local hover bike gangsand they tend not to like losing. The Seductress - the oldest trade is alive and well in space and business is booming. You might be a prostitute who dreams of starting her own brothel, a stripper who hopes to have her own club one day, or a simple hustler, seducing marks while you skim casino chips from their piles or drugging them and lifting their wallets. Whatever your trade, your body is your best asset. The Arms Dealer - pistols, shotguns, rifles, if it shoots you are looking to sell it. Weapons are a hot commodity in the circles you run, just look out for double crosses, youd hate to get robbed with the merchandise you just sold someone. Hope to team up with a good smuggler or have a ship with a secret cargo-hold as authorities dont take kindly to what you traffic. The Smuggler - guns, drugs, slaves, even untaxed goods, all are in high demand and all are very illegal. Luckily for you that means you can earn a hefty sum if you know how to move things unnoticed. Get a fast ship, learn who to bribe, and figure out the best routes to avoid local militia and get your goods safely to their rightful owners. The Pirate - extensive travel has taught you it is easier to simply take what you want rather than earn it. The economy of the universe is rich and that means plenty of shipping to raid and pillage. Take what you want from giant corporations and criminal organizations as long as your ship and crew and strong enough. Just watch out for bounty hunters sent from those youve robbed. The Bounty Hunter - some parts of the galaxy are lacking in law enforcement. Some crime lords need an extra hand keeping the riffraff in line. Some people just want petty revenge. Bounties solve all these problems and you are there to collect them. Travel the galaxy hunting down some of the worst scum and turn them in for a sizable rewarddead or alive. The Thief - you may be a simple pickpocket, a stick-up artist, or hoping to put together your own heist crew to take down huge scores. Whatever you are, you steal. Look to do everything from sticking up bookies, to robbing strip clubs, to hijacking hover cars and bikes. With nimble fingers and knowledge of who the local fence is, you can quickly turn anothers property into a mountain of credits. The Slicer - safe cracker, lock picker, hacker, and/or security expert. You can get past almost any alarm, firewall, or lock. Maybe you sell your services to the highest bidder. Maybe you steal from corporate accounts. Maybe you blackmail with the information youve stolen. Either way you are a tech junkie extraordinaire that no one wants to be on the bad side of. I can also help craft a backstory for your character if you need help or want some ideas (say if you want to have an enemy or a bounty on your head or be deep indebted to someone, etc) or simply to try and make a good combined backstory for you and the other players.

This is for a long term role-play. Set in a cyberpunk future in the outskirts of the galaxy, where the law isn't as pervasive and things like sex, gambling, and drugs are everywhere. You could be a group of bounty hunters, smugglers, prostitutes or a heist crew or a mixed up grab bag of women just trying to make it to the next job. I'm ideally wanting to do this over discord, via voice chat preferred, but we can also do it over text. I'm thinking meeting once a week or once every two weeks (whatever we can work out given schedules). I am on central time so maybe thinking playing Mon-Thrus during the evening for me most likely times, but it would all depend on when everyone is free. Kink/limit wise I am thinking since there will be a lot of people to keep it more vanilla (sexy outfits, domination, submission, exhibitionism, light bondage etc being okay while incest, ageplay, beastiality and toilet stuff are out), though because of the criminal and drug use aspect I am thinking of dub con/non con being part of it but again that will be dependent on who joins. Also since this is a crew of women who might want to connect with each other, possibly being okay with male and female partners for sex scenes might be your best bet (but not required). Also for the sake of trying to make something that can include a lot of people I'm leaving aliens off the table, so everything will be human characters and sex scenes. This roleplay will also have some simple stat systems for things like physical, mental, social, and sexual abilities (I might make it more complex depending on the players wishes) and ship stats as well. If you are interested (it might take me a little while to get back to you if you message me) message me with the following: -what character roles you would be interested in playing -what time zone you are in -what days of the weeks/times would be best for you -if you want to do this over text or voice on discord -any issues with the kinks/limits I talked about above (and if there is any kink or limit you particularly want included or not included) -if you are okay with both male and female partners for sex scenes or only prefer one or the other If you are interested here are some possible ideas for character roles, feel free to pick one, make up your own or expand upon any idea I offer (the main thing is I am thinking no matter what you choose that it be you are just starting out at it, not already established, so if you pick a bounty hunter you are a fairly new one not the universe's best bounty hunter) Possible Roles you can play (or feel free to make up one or combine some together) **The Fighter** - a mix of MMA fighting and oil wrestling, the fights are one of the most popular events to watch and wager on. Serious fighting with a dash of sexual spectacle combine to entertain fans and gamblers alike. Youll have a stage persona and will work your way through amateur matches to the big leagues. Expect to have offers to throw fights from local crime lords, the occasional obsessed fan, and your uniform to not make it through every fight in one piece. **The Enforcer** - bodyguard for hire, leg breaker for loansharks, or simple mercenary. Youre job is to have the muscle and big guns. Expect to be the lead in gunfights, be protector of the crew, and chase down anyone who might owe money. **The Gambler** - maybe youre a card sharp, maybe youre a bookie, maybe youre just a degenerate who blows through your credits faster than you can earn them. You are a mainstay at the race tracks, card tables, gambling dens, and oil fights. Youll tend to know where the action is and maybe who to bet on. If you are lucky you might keep the crew afloat, if not you might be the reason that loansharks are hounding you from system to system. **The Pusher** - you are a simple drug dealer, selling depressants, stimulants, and hallucinogens at hugely marked up prices. Expect to start small before working your way up to wholesale. Some systems are strict on drug trafficking, others more lenient, so you may have to be extra careful depending where you are. Whether you make it a habit to go back to your customers homes and share the goods you just sold them is up to you. **The Racer** - hover bike racing is the other big draw for gamblers and fans across the universe. Start in the beginners circuits and work your way to the big time if you can get a fast enough bike that is. You can earn quite a bit betting on yourself if you are fast enough, but many races will pit you against members of local hover bike gangsand they tend not to like losing. **The Seductress** - the oldest trade is alive and well in space and business is booming. You might be a prostitute who dreams of starting her own brothel, a stripper who hopes to have her own club one day, or a simple hustler, seducing marks while you skim casino chips from their piles or drugging them and lifting their wallets. Whatever your trade, your body is your best asset. **The Arms Dealer** - pistols, shotguns, rifles, if it shoots you are looking to sell it. Weapons are a hot commodity in the circles you run, just look out for double crosses, youd hate to get robbed with the merchandise you just sold someone. Hope to team up with a good smuggler or have a ship with a secret cargo-hold as authorities dont take kindly to what you traffic. **The Smuggler** - guns, drugs, slaves, even untaxed goods, all are in high demand and all are very illegal. Luckily for you that means you can earn a hefty sum if you know how to move things unnoticed. Get a fast ship, learn who to bribe, and figure out the best routes to avoid local militia and get your goods safely to their rightful owners. **The Pirate** - extensive travel has taught you it is easier to simply take what you want rather than earn it. The economy of the universe is rich and that means plenty of shipping to raid and pillage. Take what you want from giant corporations and criminal organizations as long as your ship and crew and strong enough. Just watch out for bounty hunters sent from those youve robbed. **The Bounty Hunter** - some parts of the galaxy are lacking in law enforcement. Some crime lords need an extra hand keeping the riffraff in line. Some people just want petty revenge. Bounties solve all these problems and you are there to collect them. Travel the galaxy hunting down some of the worst scum and turn them in for a sizable rewarddead or alive. **The Thief** - you may be a simple pickpocket, a stick-up artist, or hoping to put together your own heist crew to take down huge scores. Whatever you are, you steal. Look to do everything from sticking up bookies, to robbing strip clubs, to hijacking hover cars and bikes. With nimble fingers and knowledge of who the local fence is, you can quickly turn anothers property into a mountain of credits. **The Slicer** - safe cracker, lock picker, hacker, and/or security expert. You can get past almost any alarm, firewall, or lock. Maybe you sell your services to the highest bidder. Maybe you steal from corporate accounts. Maybe you blackmail with the information youve stolen. Either way you are a tech junkie extraordinaire that no one wants to be on the bad side of. I can also help craft a backstory for your character if you need help or want some ideas (say if you want to have an enemy or a bounty on your head or be deep indebted to someone, etc) or simply to try and make a good combined backstory for you and the other players. All level of players are welcome (even newbies who havent really done role-play or group role-play). This will be my first time being storyteller for a group of players (only done one on one before) so dont feel like you arent experienced enough. It will be a learning process for all."

Then once you have a way in, you work your magic slow then you ramp it up, understand?"" In a dark room, illuminated by a dozen computer screens, a man in a hoodie sits hunched over a keyboard. ""If she figures it out too soon, she'll panic, and do something stupid, like go to a hospital or police station."" He pulls a device out of the side of his computer and spins in his chair. Three other men in hoodies stand in the centre of the room. They have black, flat masks that cover their faces simply. The man leans back in his chair. ""We test out our software tonight. If we have a positive reaction, then we'll initiate the hack next week."" He puts his mask on too, smiling, then looks up at his group. ""Ready boys?"" -------------------------------------------------- In the year 2077, human beings are fitted with cybernetic enhancements to the brain that allow for people to be constantly interacting with the net. All your thoughts are uploaded to a highly encrypted cloud, along with everything you see and feel, in case you ever need to be ""backed up."" The way we approached the world changed as well. We were no longer limited to our physical bodies, and so society in general, improved exponentially. Racism, sexism, every kind of prejudice was slowly eliminated, as people could literally walk a mile in anyone else's shoes. It was a utopia. As a way to curb sexual crime, and also to liberate the minds and libidos of the world, people upload approximations of their physical selves to the net so that strangers may have ""cyber sex"" with their avatars. Cybersex is for all intents and purposes the exact same as real life sex, except for tiny, minute differences. There's a *slight* uncanny valley. Imagine the freedom. Have a crush on a girl at the office? Find her profile, and get nasty! Girlfriend broke up with you? Watch her get gangbanged into submission by twelve of your virtual clones. Always wanted to be with a famous singer? Just download her and spend every lonely night with Katy Perry! All avatars are downloadable by anyone from a database, and can be used interchangeably, to live out any sexual situation imaginable. **But then again. Nothing beats the real thing.** While in large part, this has drastically reduced sex crime, as basically all sexual desires can be acted out in cyberspace, it has had the unfortunate effect of creating a small subculture of ""Bodyjackers"" - hackers who seek to find their sexual conquests physical forms in real life, and hack their cybernetic implants to coerce them into engaging in sexual acts. Since so much sex is now virtual, these Bodyjackers relentlessly pursue the real thing. And you've become their next target. They will use every tool in their arsenal to hack your life. Taking over your body and mind and using you how they wish. Will you be able to fight back? ------------------------------------------------------------------ *I'm looking to tell a long-form story with a creative partner who would like to explore a cyberpunk setting akin to* **Ghost in the Shell.** *A group of evil hackers have set their sights on you, and want to ""hack"" you into fucking them.* *This is a dark scenario that will involve mind control, literal body control, coercion, transformation, group, gangbang, humiliation, dom/sub and many many more. It will be CYOA, however, and I want it to play out like a bit of a game. You CAN defeat the evil hackers and take back your life. Or it can have a ""bad ending""... that's up to us.* *Message me with a solid character backstory. Tell me about her life in this cyberpunk world. What she looks like (a few choices of celebrity face claims are a good idea) and tell me your kinks. I myself am open to literally everything for this RP, I want to test my limits. And most importantly, I want this to tell a really fucking cool story.* *Im also really open to collaborating with more than one person on this story - we could all work together to tell a story collaboratively. Let me know if that works for you.*"

It was never quiet here, but the weather was enough to clear the sidewalks a bit. Bronze hated it, but she hated everything. When Ilia glanced up through the clear plexiglass overhead, the high projected holograms of Zentile rotated like splotchy watercolor. It was one of the few times the District actually looked pretty, in her opinion, and the crush of bodies that usually teemed wasn't something she missed, even if she would catch hell for a slow night. Raking her fingers back through an icy blonde pixie cut, Ilia glanced sidelong at her companion. Company girls always traveled in pairs, at least until one was picked up. There were plenty of microlounges through the streets to disappear into that were far safer than traveling with a John to a second location, and it kept you close to your partner if you weren't both scooped up. Bronze talked a good talk, but at the end of the day she played by the rules and often pulled in a decent number of chits. It helped that she was a statuesque thing of beauty, with long, dark hair interspersed with glowing extensions of purple and blue, mile-long legs, big tits. She'd also been doing this since she was a teen and had a pussy that could milk cum from a cock. ""Right. Because Cooper is just going to let you transfer to some other pimp."" Ilia scoffed and leaned back against the wall behind her with her hips pushed out, emphasizing the smooth plane of her bared abdomen. She, by comparison, was small with a bad attitude, her body elfin with firm little tits and a tiny waist. Her face would have looked too innocent for the job, if not for the dissilusionment in her dark eyes and the quirk of her lips. She took the give-no-shits-skimpy approach, with fishnets, tiny shredded shorts that didn't quite cover her ass entirely, a mesh shirt that clearly showed a purple bra beneath, and combat boots. Curling tattoos crawled down the backs of her thighs, only slightly obscured by the fishnets. It was a wonder she was taken on as a company girl at all for the mouth she had on her, but there was always someone who liked to put a pretty, sassy little thing in her place. ""Besides, everywhere is just about the same as here, B. What's the point of just finding *new* bullshit?"" A cab drove past, beeping at a drunk stumbling across the street while headed deeper into the District.

Ilia lunged forward, arms outstretched to Bronze. The confident figures cleared the shadows of the alley to step into the wash of colors illuminating the street from the huge advertising screens lining the buildings above. And one had a shoulder-fired rocket launcher. Was it too much to ask to just be able to peaceably whore on a corner without your street getting blown up? Ilia's lean little body coiled and sprung, leaping at her companion and smacking hard into her body as the two of them fell to the ground. Bronze started cursing, but less than a breath later heat seared overtop of their heads and the glass of the storefront they were loitering in front of shattered as shrapnel from the car crashed through it.

I am looking for a story that involves some danger and intrigue. I have ideas, but I would like a partner who brings ideas for the story to the table to make it a shared piece. I'm looking for a bit of a darker tone considering the setting. Who your character is is completely open. Gang member/leader? Politician sneaking into the seedy underbelly of the city?

Or we can get into the choking, spanking, rough, animalistic sex, or kinky BDSM rope play, or... I have a lot of kinks. I would say try me. You'll make me swoon if you like crafting intense, passionate, dark, conflicted relationships between broken characters like I do. If you're interested, I would like you to write something for your character so I can get a sense of him, and you. I'm happy to talk about the story as well, but I would like to start with that.

18,cyber crime,dirtypenpals,[F4M] Cyber punk-ish prostitute in a dark city of crime and troubles (long-term story with lots of options),1,e3wt8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/e3wt8x/f4m_cyber_punkish_prostitute_in_a_dark_city_of/,2019-12-01 01:08:13,"""I should move to New San Fran or something. This weather is bullshit."" A thin mumble of rain soaked the slick pavement, illuminated red in the eponymous lights of the District like droplets of neon. It was never quiet here, but the weather was enough to clear the sidewalks a bit. Ilia couldn't help but smirk at the complaint. Her companion, Bronze, hated the city's gloomy weather, but then again she hated everything. When Ilia glanced up through the clear plexiglass overhead, the high projected holograms of Zentile rotated like splotchy watercolor. It was one of the few times the District actually looked pretty, in her opinion, and the crush of bodies that usually teemed wasn't something she missed, even if she would catch hell for a slow night. Raking her fingers back through a real blue pixie, Ilia glanced sidelong at her companion. Company girls always traveled in pairs, at least until one was picked up. There were plenty of microlounges through the streets to disappear into that were far safer than traveling with a John to a second location, and it kept you close to your partner if you weren't both scooped up. Better than being out alone. Bronze talked a good talk about getting out and all that, but at the end of the day she played by the rules and pulled in a decent number of chits because she didn't stick her neck out, unlike Ilia. She was a good partner, really. It helped that the woman was a statuesque thing of beauty, with long, dark hair interspersed with glowing extensions of purple and blue, mile-long legs, big tits. She'd also been doing this since she was a teen and had a pussy that could milk cum from a cock. It added an air of legitimacy to their duo, as far as Ilia was concerned. ""Right. Because Cooper is just going to let you transfer to some other pimp."" Ilia scoffed and leaned back against the wall behind her with her hips pushed out, emphasizing the smooth plane of her bared abdomen and the twin hills of her iliac crest. She, by comparison, was small with a bad attitude, her body elfin with firm little tits and a tiny waist. Her face would have looked too innocent for the job, if not for the dissilusionment in her dark green eyes and the quirk of her lips. She took the give-no-shits-skimpy approach to her attire, with fishnets, tiny shredded shorts that didn't quite cover her ass entirely, a mesh shirt that clearly showed a purple bra beneath, and combat boots. Curling tattoos of blue-scaled fish swam down the backs of her thighs to her ankles, only slightly obscured by the fishnets. In fairness, her attire warned of her tongue enough, she thought. It was a wonder she was taken on as a company girl at all for the mouth she had on her, but there was always someone who liked to put a pretty, sassy little thing in her place. ""Besides, everywhere is just about the same as here, B. What's the point of just finding *new* bullshit?"" An unmarked white sports car drove past, beeping at a drunk stumbling across the street while headed deeper into the District. They were only a couple of blocks in, still accessible to the more civilised parts of the population without requiring business bros to travel through the layers of seedy underbelly that stacked on one another the further in you went. Ilia glanced down from the plexiglass to look at the back of the car just in time for her eyes to go wide. ""Oh for *fuckssake*!"" Bronze hadn't noticed the cluster of individuals striding purposefully from an alley toward the car from the opposite direction, but she didn't have Ilia's ocular augmentations either. Everything seemed to happen at once. The car screeched to a halt, a figure popping out of a sun roof wearing a gaudy purple suit and wielding two oversized pulse pistols. Ilia lunged forward, arms outstretched to Bronze. The confident figures cleared the shadows of the alley to step into the wash of colors illuminating the street from the huge advertising screens lining the buildings above. The bottom half of their faces were covered with scaled half-masks. And, of *course*, one had a shoulder-fired rocket launcher, because one easy night was just too much to ask. Couldn't you justpeaceably whore on a corner without your street getting blown up? *This fucking city.* Ilia's lean little body coiled and sprung, leaping at her companion and smacking hard into her body as the two of them fell to the ground. Bronze started cursing, but less than a breath later heat seared overtop of their heads and the glass of the storefront they were loitering in front of shattered down over them as shrapnel from the car crashed through it. The explosion rocked the block and caused alarms to go off around the street. Though she was much smaller, Ilia curled protectively over Bronze, cupping her hands over the woman's head and hissing ""Mother fucking *Dragons*, can't they go to minutes without fucking something up?"" ------- Thanks for sticking through that! At this prompt's most basic level, I want to play a plucky prostitute in a distopic, cyber punk kind of setting. This is a vignette of a day (well, night) in her life, and if you want to play a member of a gang/syndicate, we can go from here, or you can choose someone else and we can pick a different place to start from. I am looking for a story that involves danger, violence, intrigue, and romance. I have ideas for where to take it, but I would like a partner who brings ideas for the story to the table to make it a shared piece. I'm looking for a darker tone considering the setting. Who your character is is completely up to you. Gang member/leader? Politician sneaking into the seedy underbelly of the city? Detective walking the beat? Serial killer? Mechanic with a heart of gold? You don't need to choose any of those, but what I'm getting at here is I'd like you to pick something you find interesting. He can be nice, he can be a dick, he can be a casanova, hell, he could be clairvoyant or secretly immortal. Sky's the limit. As far as kinks and limits go, I'm not into scat, vore, celebrities, and one-dimensional relationships. I am willing to take the kinks this story anywhere. If you want your dude to just be looking for hot vanilla sex that will emotionally confuse our main female character, I'm cool with that! Or we can get into the choking, spanking, rough, animalistic sex, or kinky BDSM rope play, or... I have a lot of kinks. I would say try me. You'll make me swoon if you like crafting intense, passionate, dark, conflicted relationships between broken characters like I do. If you're interested, I would like you to write some intro for your character so I can get a sense of him, and you. I'm happy to talk about the story as well, but I would like to start with that. I also only use Reddit PMs, I don't use Reddit chat. If it takes you a little bit to craft a reply, that's totally ok, feel free to send it over even if this has been up a while. Thanks!"

I was relaxing near the bar trying to carve out a space among the throng of people. When a young looking guy approached me in a trench coat, with a blue Mohawk, ,and two bottle-cap looking cyber-eyes that glowed off color to the vibrant lights of the club. He slammed a small shrink rapped looking pill on the counter and slid if over to me. The pill was bright pink with a little circuit board engraved into the surface of the bill. ""First ones free!"" He yelled with a snicker and disappeared back into the crowd. I grabbed the small package on the bar ""What the hell"" I thought and ripped it open and swallowed the pill. I felt strange almost instantly, but that quickly wore off and I proceeded to go dance off the drug. I came to strapped to a table in a grimy dark room with a large unlit medical lamp overhead. A short looking man was washing his hands in a rusted sink. When he turned around I saw him in a heavy green medical apron with fresh latex gloves. ""Don't worry my love"" he cooed ""we are just...upgrading you"" he said with a heavy German accent. I woke up sometime later in a small strange room with a glass wall down the middle and a fancy looking camera on the other side. A speaker on the other side sounded ""Cyber Girl Auction starts in 10 miniatures, please start to peruse the merchandise"" And then I saw it my body, almost indistinguishable from myself. I could see small black lines on my synthetic skin. I also noticed that I was naked, and that my breasts were many sizes bigger as my hips were also wider. I went to scream but found myself unable. I went to punch the glass in front of me but was unable. I had become a cyborg slave. ] ----- So here is my prompt your own cyborg slave!"

I seek someone to share my unfettered sexually sensuous self with; lust laden dalliances and all. A like-minded partner that is creative, capable and carnal of mind. Think you might be the one? I sure hope so! Before we strike up a conversation together, however, there are a few things you might like to know. Here are a few quick tidbits in no particular order: &amp;#x200B; I am an avid, experienced role player that prefers multi-paragraph but flexible posting from the third person point of view. I fancy myself sapiosexual first and pansexual second. I am a voracious reader, aspiring writer, terrible gamer, all-encompassing nerd, insatiable floozy and proud pervert. I have a predisposition for exotic settings and equally exotic characters, pulling inspiration from nearly every genre of literature and the weird landscape of my own mind. Finally, I possess a veritable armada of fantasies and fetishes each of which I so dearly wish to poke and prod at. Know that I am not easily shocked and appreciate blunt honesty when sharing any and all of your deep seeded carnal instincts. Very few limits will impede our shared sexual exploration and deviance. &amp;#x200B; Still interested? Good! Know that of all the things I seek in a partner the ability to be fearlessly creative is the single trait I value the most. Know that I have many settings, characters and plot hooks I can offer freely to spark us off, but, also know that I thrill in discovering anothers deep seeded fantasies. Furthermore, know that I adore world building and would be happy to spend my afternoon doing just, crafting an idea from a spark to a blaze; after all what we build together with passion and flare will undoubtedly lead us towards a splendidly messy finale. &amp;#x200B; Of course who am I to post here without a few ideas of my own? I'd still love to hear your own ideas, but, here are a few plot hooks that might be of interest: &amp;#x200B; &gt;**The Long Haul** &gt; &gt;*Possible Erotic Themes  Incest, Seclusion, Transhumanism, Enhancement, Corruption* &gt; &gt;Hook  The infinite gulfs of black between the motes of light that illuminate our Galaxy require a toll of time to traverse, a lonely endeavor. Payload Inc. is an innovative, interstellar logistics operation. A family oriented enterprise captained by a father, daughter duo. Genevieve Kavanagh and her Daddy make a team like no other, natural born spacer stock through and through. Together, alone, the Kavanagh family livelihood brings seclusion and cramped spaces, the pair oft spending weeks or months on end braving the solitary reaches of deep space. With civilization all but a distant memory and not a pair of eyes to judge for hundreds of billions of kilometers in any direction it is easy to lose ones selves to burgeoning desire born of claustrophobic confines. It wont be long until the spark of mutual lusts ignite passions as quick to burn out of control as a rampaging brush fire, wanton need escalating beyond the bounds of the taboo. A shared sexual awakening certain to change the lives of this daddy, daughter team. Settling in to the new paradigm of their relationship the taboo couple might just discover what one might consider the best possible use of their Companys profits, a top-end suite of his and her body improvements exploring the realms of genetic manipulation, cyber-ware, cutting edge organic enhancements and enthusiast implants. &gt; &gt;**Goblin Games** &gt; &gt;*Possible Erotic Themes: Interracial of the Fantasy variety - Alcohol + Drugs - Prostitution* &gt; &gt;Minxi is the sole proprietor of The Dragon's Dalliance Drinkhouse, one of the most popular watering holes in the Lotus Kingdom's capitol city. A successful woman by any measure, as a Goblin her achievements are almost unheard of. Minxi is a greedy and gregarious green Goblin Goddess that is as gorgeous as she is graceful. Penelope Puzzle is Minxi's firecracker of a sister that owns a brothel just across the street. The sisters are competitive to a fault and will do anything to one up the other. Some say that they have a high stakes bet going between one another, winner takes all and that their rivalry started when they were but girls when one stole the other's boyfriend; though who stole whose is uncertain. Their businesses have found a comfortable and lucrative home in the city's red light district. A raucous and bawdy bar that serves all manner of prurient patron and an indecorous brothel worked by waif and wench, and everything from Goblin to Elf. &gt; &gt;**Mindfuck** &gt; &gt;*Possible Erotic Themes: Mind Control - Virtual Avatars - Body Swap - Body Modification - Gender Manipulation - Reprogrammed Personality - Group Sex - Public Sex* &gt; &gt;Hook  With the advent of full dive virtual reality and the digitization of the Human mind a new and insidious category of crime has emerged. Despite developers claiming the iron clad security of their networks the mind can be vulnerable to the ingenious predator when one invests their consciousness so completely into a computer simulation. Those with the skill to pull off a Mind Hack are exceedingly rare for the Human mind remains incredibly resilient to tampering even with the sensorium all but hijacked already by a world seeming as real as any other. At least one person has devised a way burning down the safeties to access the raw melange of code that makes up the greater whole that is the digital mind. Such access would allow unprecedented power over a person, ther veritable ability to rewrite a Human being, modify memory, tweak even an established personality and even assume control of motor function. This individual scours the net seeking that one perfect victim to make their plaything, their internet doll. &gt; &gt;**Yumi's Yummies: Confectionery and Cream** &gt; &gt;*Possible Erotic Themes  Loss of Innocence, Corruption, Otaku, Incest, Prostitution.* &gt; &gt;Hook  This is the tale of a young Japanese womans decent into depravity. Yumi Shinozaki finally took the plunge! She had always dreamed of travelling somewhere exotic, so in the run up to high school graduation she applied to a half dozen North American universities. Finally! A prestigious campus in Canada accepted her! It had all worked out perfectly, her Uncle even lived in the city and had a spare guest room she could rent to save some money. Of course Karlys Mother protested the choice stating she was not comfortable with Karly living anywhere near that man. Karlys new host turns out to be quite the pervert and between an Otaku Uncle and the temptations of University life Karly finds herself upon a lascivious crash course of sexual awakening. Taking a job at an Ice Cream Parlour to pay her own way the newly minted nympho is quick to mix business and pleasure. &gt; &gt;**The Scarlet Second** &gt; &gt;*Possible Themes - Aliens, Mega Constructs, Hyper Technology, Transhumanism, Prostitution, Interspecies relations, Sexual Freedom, Drugs, Party Lifestyle, High-tech sex toys, Exhibitionism.* &gt; &gt;Hook - The Scarlet Second is the Milky Way Galaxys preeminent, prurient paradise, a tourist destination like no other. A Ring World of gargantuan proportions the infamous Scarlet Second offers temptation and excitement sure to seduce even the most discerning and exotic of Galactic species. This is an entire artificial world, forged from the component molecules of hundreds of infant planets, built to fulfill the singular purpose of getting the collective rocks of the Milky Ways vast and varied inhabitants off. From posh pubs to legendary parties, lascivious amusements and the Galaxys most exquisite prostitutes The Scarlet Second has anything and everything one might desire. And dont forget, as one old Earth saying goes, What happens on The Scarlet Second stays on The Scarlet Second! &gt; &gt;**Dangerous Days** &gt; &gt;*Possible Erotic Themes  Psuedo NonCon, Corruption, Size Differences, Transformation, Addiction.* &gt; &gt;Hook  Cheesy, 1980s B-grade science fiction in all its gawdy glory. Think Escape from New York fucks Heavy Metal magazine, this is their baby. All big hair, leather and latex fashion and overt sexualization all wrapped up with b-movie ridiculousness. The Ever Night has dawned, darkness swallowing our planet whole. The failing electric light of Humanity's greatest cities and the sombre blood red glow of our eclipsed sun the final light that will touch our Earth. Brutish things stalk the deepest shadows to drag men and women to the darkness where ill fates and new twisted beginnings await. Those taken are changed never again able to find solace or pleasure in the arms of another Human again; Only the Dark Ones will serve. &gt; &gt;**Double Dipping** &gt; &gt;*Possible Erotic Themes - Cuckold, Domination, Lengthy Seduction, Cheating, Polyamorous Relationships* &gt; &gt;Hook  A bisexual dominatrix separately seduces the Husband and Wife of a classic nuclear family thus kicking off a sordid tale of love, lust and infidelity that climaxes in our intrepid anti-heroine bringing the couple together, same place, same time, same purpose, just to watch the sparks fly. So, are you interested? If my eccentricity has not chased you away let us enjoy an adventure, or many, together, ones of sexual deviance, exotic wonder, dazzling extremes and so much more. Drop me a red letter in my box and let's indulge."

I am a 32 yo redhaired English woman and for those that are really bothered 145lbs, 5ft 8, 38d, UK size 14 which pretty much makes me the curvy type fair skinned with freckles, so you get the picture. Whilst I class myself as bi-sexual I am much more drawn to other women these days and fell happier in their company both in and out of the bedroom!! I have been on here on and off for a while when I am not travelling Because of my lifestyle my private life can be pretty non-existent so I like to retreat to the online world for fun and adventure when I get the chance. Particular turn ons are kidnapping, older younger relationships but NOT age play. I do however enjoy playing out a mother/daughter fantasy with the daughter around 20 and the 40/50 something conservative mother. I also enjoy the thought of lactation seduction pentration with foreign objects or plants, photo shoots, voyeurism and public sex acts. I'm not into gore, scat, non consensual or extreme violence. I have also always said I am not into BDSM either but never say never ...hey. Looking for someone similar who would like to explore their boundaries with me and would like to get creative building up characters motivations and situations, not just a quick cyber sex session!! Although I want the sex to be really hot when it comes up....not much to ask for then!!!!! Anyway if you think you fit the bill say hello nd tell me what you would like to do with me. Thank you for looking xxxx"

Always wanted to be with a famous singer? Just download her and spend every lonely night with Katy Perry! All avatars are downloadable by anyone from a database, and can be used interchangeably, to live out any sexual situation imaginable. **But then again. Nothing beats the real thing.** While in large part, this has drastically reduced sex crime, as basically all sexual desires can be acted out in cyberspace, it has had the unfortunate effect of creating a small subculture of ""Bodyjackers"" - hackers who seek to find their sexual conquests physical forms in real life, and hack their cybernetic implants to coerce them into engaging in sexual acts. Since so much sex is now virtual, these Bodyjackers relentlessly pursue the real thing. And you've become their next target. They will use every tool in their arsenal to hack your life. Taking over your body and mind and using you how they wish. Will you be able to fight back? ------------------------------------------------------------------ *I'm looking to tell a long-form story with a creative partner who would like to explore a cyberpunk setting akin to* **Ghost in the Shell.** *A group of evil hackers have set their sights on you, and want to ""hack"" you into fucking them.* *This is a dark scenario that will involve mind control, literal body control, coercion, transformation, group, gangbang, humiliation, dom/sub and many many more. It will be CYOA, however, and I want it to play out like a bit of a game. You CAN defeat the evil hackers and take back your life. Or it can have a ""bad ending""... that's up to us.* *Message me with a solid character backstory. Tell me about her life in this cyberpunk world. What she looks like (a few choices of celebrity face claims are a good idea) and tell me your kinks. I myself am open to literally everything for this RP, I want to test my limits. And most importantly, I want this to tell a really fucking cool story.* *Hope to hear from you!* "

And that may be true. For inner systems. But out here on the edge of the treaty zone just outside the Pirate controlled quadrant on the Asteroid City, it's the furthest you could get. Three hundred square miles of rock in space, like New York City if it had three sides and a hollowed out center for mining operations. Owned by a rich Silvarian mining family. And it's like no Human city on Earth there ever was. Skyscrapers engulfed in smog and unregulated chemical fumes--making for a rain-like condensation, thousands of billboards, vid-screens, and holograms advertising strip-clubs and every kind of porn. Homelessness at 13%. Wages averaging 5 credits an hour. It's ground zero for drugs, crime, and hit-men of all species. Alien nightclub owners like Brolzak or gangsters like Varo Goldhand rule the rock with their potent drugs that get you high, horny, or easily manipulated. And Asteroid Security (A-Sec)--dubious enough on their own, is in their pockets. Who'd rather space you than deal with the paperwork, or sell any inconvenient people next time a Slaver ship from Pirate space makes dock. It's a hopeless, impoverished, grimy, crime ridden hell. But, it's [**your**](URL home. Guess the closest thing you can compare yourself to is Earth's mythological hero ""Batman"". Orphaned as a child, devoted the remainder of his life training to fight crime in all forms, empowered with some inheritance for the latest technology, weapons, and armor. Also, getting on the bad side of every grotesque villain this side of the Asteroid. From the Paghi A-Sec officers ""Pigs"", Maraxxian genetic pirates ""The Hive"", cyber criminal gangs, pimps like Varo Ironhand. The list goes on. Tonight's just another night of cleaning the gutter, as you sit perched on a rooftop overlooking some fine gentlemen unloading crates of red crystalline substances. And from the bribe they passed over to the Pig earlier, it's definitely stronger stuff than salt. --- Hello, I'm Sadistic Dreamer, and I will be your Game Master and guide throughout your adventure on this tainted ass methed up Alien Chicago that makes Mos Eisely look like Disney World full of relentless gangsters, fratty crooked Cops, and a whole world of worse.

33,cyber crime,dirtypenpals,[A4A] Meet the Superheroes and Supervillains of New Central City!,1,8a4ogo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8a4ogo/a4a_meet_the_superheroes_and_supervillains_of_new/,2018-04-06 09:31:13,"(As long as this prompt is still here, it's open.) **Introduction:** *Meanwhile, somewhere on the East Coast of New America...* Men rush by with clipboards under their arms, each one as well dressed and suited as the other. The day was not particularly important, far from it actually, just another day working at the G.A.C. Government Assisted Control, codeword for the watchmen who watched over the watchmen. The hero police, to put it simply, those simple mortals whose power was nothing in comparison to the great heroes (and villains) of New Central City, and as such, could only spectate and try to give them rules to follow by. Their other role was to assist as well, and the G.A.C. central tower, found right smack in the centre of the city, served as something of a stronghold to the heroes. It was about mid-day time, and everyone was in a panic to try and get enough coffees out as they could to please all the guardians of the city. But more important was that, was the Map, a virtual overlook in the middle of the command centre which allowed the G.A.C. to observe where crimes were happening, in real time, and get the heroes to work on it. Today wasn't too different to the others. Bank robbery on Lincoln Street, a Hostage situation in one of the many hospitals, and the Great Eastern Bay was under siege again. For most cities, this would be a panic, a shock even, something of a great crisis. But New Central City was anything but a normal city. Around ten times the size of New York City, and holding a population of one hundred million citizens, a third of the entire country, crimes which were catastrophic in other cities were the norm here. A new era brought about new problems. Mutants, Super Villains, hostile aliens, enhanced criminals. Twenty years ago, a decision was made. To bring about a civilian battle force to fight back against these evil forces. That was when the Super Heroes Association Guild was formed. S.H.A.G. From the very first to the very last, the G.A.C. kept an extensive database on all of the heroes in the city, as well as the villains too. This information contained everything from birth names, powers, their relationships and images for their appearances, but much was left blank for those heroes or villains of which their history was a mystery. The database contained two large files, one for heroes, and one for villains, predictably, though not all of said powerful individuals were quite in one or the other. For example, a mercenary who served her own purpose, would she be a villain? What about sibling rivalry? Could a hero truly be a hero even if they used brutal tactics? And so on. Still, Chief Commander McGibbons liked to check over the database everyday, preferably with a large cup of coffee, just to keep track of all these crazy, spandex wearing lunatics. The list seemed to keep getting bigger and bigger each day, though it was good for the Commander to focus on the top 20 heroes, and top 20 villains as well. Logging onto the huge computer which was centred in the middle of the Command Centre, the Commander puts his glasses on, and begins to read. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Heroes:** Here are the Super Heroes of New Central City. Coming from locations far and wide, from the city itself, from all the way from outer space and even those who are ancient beings. These individuals risk their lives every day to save the city they love, and for that, we are forever in their service. **Amazing Ace:** Dubbed ""Mother of all Heroes"", Samantha Riggs a.k.a. Amazing Ace was and still is the first superhero chosen by the city. A former U.S. soldier, she gave up her normal life when she took on the G.A.C.'s Civilian Enhancement program to genetically modify her into a super human. Now in her mid 50's, but still looking in her early 30's due to the serum, Amazing Ace serves the city with pride, and is considered the leader of all the heroes. She has light blonde hair, bright blue eyes and pale skin, with a voluptuous build, average height and toned body. Amazing Ace is the mother of Survivor and Elastica, as well as Ex-Wife to super villain The Master, who happens to be her Arch-Nemesis. Her powers include super strength, super speed and flight. **Jelly Boy:** A hyperfeminine and friendly young guy, Jelly Boy, real name unpronounceable by human tongues, is a sweet and courageous super hero who uses his slimy powers to protect citizens. Born in a mystical forrest, far, far away, he and his older brother, Slimeball, were raised on the streets of New Central City. But where as Slimeball took a path into crime, Jelly Boy decided to use his powers for good. Being a Slime, who doesn't really have a gender, Jelly Boy, known as Jelly to his friends, can stretch his body in any shape, increase and decrease his size and transform his body into an desirable object or feature. Where as his brother's body is more slime based, Jelly has more of a 'solid' body, so to speak, which allows him to stay in form and look relatively human, despite being blue and semi-transparent. His arch nemesis is his brother, Slimeball, but this is due more to sibling rivalry more than anything. **Cyber Girl:** Cyber Girl (real name Celestia Zhu) was a nobody, a long time ago. Diseased and disabled, as well as orphaned and poor, she struggled on the mean streets of New Central City, making her living by fixing various computers and robots for thugs and other criminals, all at the tender age of 8. A secret girl genius, she was found and 'repaired' by her caring but evil foster parent, Tin-Man, who took pity on her, have a great sense of empathy for things that are 'broken'. However, she soon turned against him when she realised his villain status, and defected to the Heroes, where she has served ever since. A genius with computers and technology, and being a cyborg herself, Cyber Girl is the technological expert for the heroes. She is slender with pale skin, Asian in appearance, One of her legs and one of her arms are entirely mechanical in purpose, as well as other parts of her body, being some 75% robotic. Despite this, Cyber Girl is a deeply caring and kind person, with a beating, human heart of gold. Her arch nemesis is Tin-Man, though she could never bring herself to truly hurt him due to their Father-Daughter relationship. **Iron Rod:** A former factory worker, Anton Kuznetsov was working late in his company's factory, where an experimental and new type of metal was accidentally poured over him. Intense pain followed, but after that was not death like he expected, but a new body, with even greater powers. He had found his entire body turned to steel, head to toe, giving him immense and incredible strength, the most physically powerful of the heroes. He now uses his power for good to stop villains, and has a particular soft spot for the poor workers of the city. His Arch-Nemesis is Rage, more so due to her obsession with him more than anything else, but also because he is disgusted with her use of power. Iron Rod is around 8 feet tall, and was an already imposing man before gaining his power. He is fully steel, head to toe, and is incredibly muscular. **Milk Tank:** A loveable if absent minded hero, Milk Tank comes from a far away land where her people, the Bovians, being that of half cattle and half human, sent her away to better help the rest of the world. She is incredibly strong, similar to other heroes like Iron Rod, but has more stamina over strength, and is capable of fighting upon hours and hours. Milk Tank, named her 'unique abilities', does have some weaknesses though, her high sex drive being one, her need to mate at various times of the year and her involuntary lactation, which she has sometimes used as a weapon rather than an hindrance. She can be taken advantage of because of these problems, though, standing at 6 foot and with an incredibly curvy and toned body, few men feel they could 'handle' her, so to speak. Her Arch-Nemesis is Temptress, due to their races often being at conflict with each other on their home continent, though the two have often been playful and even flirtatious with each other on occasion. **The Hunter:** As cunning as much as he is a loner, The Hunter comes from a long line of expert hunters, and that didn't change when he came to the city. Raised in the wild countryside of New America, John Rivers was raised to be a hunter, to take on the greatest predator he could find, and win. However, he soon learned of the evil that lurked in the world, and found this to be an adequate target for him to hunt. A lean and built man of ambiguous ethnic backgrounds, John rarely shows his face to others, hiding under his costume instead. A man of few words, his Arch Nemesis, and total opposite, is that of Bombshell, whom share an equally begrudging respect for each other due to their mastery with weapons. The Hunter's main powers is of that of heightened alerts and reflexes, peak physical condition and excellence in weaponry, though he prefers his bow. **Magenta:** An ancient wizard from a civilisation that time forgot, Magenta's main purpose in life is to protect the good of the world, and destroy the evil. Though thousands (if not older) years old, she still maintains the appearance of a woman in her late 20s, young enough to be deeply attractive but old enough to appear wise. The wisest and calmest of the Heroes, her wisdom and guidance have kept the heroes stable since it's inception. Her powers include advanced mastery of all magics, as well as the ability to fly, amongst others. She has the appearance of a tall, curvaceous woman with brown skin, hinting that of Indian or Middle Eastern, bright purple hair (hence the name) and deep crimson eyes. She is arch-nemesis to Kraken, the evil monster of the sea, who she has sworn to defeat, time and time again. **Jax:** Jax, like his older sister, Zev, is a shapeshifting alien from a planet that once existed, but soon destroyed itself through nuclear war. Sent to earth as a small child, Jax grew up on the mean streets of New Central City with best friend Viper. Where as his sister is haughty, and believes her kind to be superior to humans, Jax considers them equals, and fights for the rights of all living beings. His powers, as describe, allow him to shape-shift, himself limited into shape shifting into various beasts and animals, whilst his elder sister, the more powerful of the two, can change her form into that of another sentient being, or a human. Jax, unlike his sister, is 'stuck' in his default appearance, bright green skin, pointed ears, obsidian black eyes and long black hair. He is slender and short, somewhat feminine in appearance but is also toned, capable of holding a fight himself. His arch-nemesis is Zev, his sister, out of rivalry and also out of huge differences in views. **Jungle Julie:** From the jungles of the Amazon itself, Julie, or 'Jungle Julie' as she is known, as a combat-loving tribal warrior, standing at 7 foot tall, intensely curvy and wearing very little other than her animal furs and large club. She, unlike the other heroes, is more interested in fighting rather than protecting the innocent, though she does care for them regardless. Though her limited speech and mannerism would indicate she is of lesser intelligence, she has a warrior's cunning that is unmatched by many of her peers. Still, Julie does have her mind focused on quite primal desires, such as eating, fighting, and fucking. She has long green hair, teal eyes and tanned skinned, a common feature of her tribe. Her arch nemesis is The Mighty Python, a rival from a warrior tribe, the two nether the less show a romantic interest in each other. **Shining Light:** An long living hero since the Medieval era, Shining Light, his true name unknown, a knight who strives in God's light, and to destroy all that is evil from the earth. A paladin of immense strength and stature, who uses his energy sword, shield, modernised power armour and mastery over holy magic, all which is evil should cower near him. His appearance is of that of someone in early 50's, maybe even later due to his long beard and grey hair, but his physical body is still vigour and healthy enough to fight. His arch nemesis is Miss Sanguis, and the two have been at battle for hundreds of years. Still, there are rumours of a deep and intense sexual tension between the two, perhaps even past experiences, though neither will admit it. **Doctor Lovegood:** Sister of Samantha Riggs, Amazing Ace, and Aunt of Survivor and Elastica is the well loved and equally eccentric Nancy Riggs, a.k.a. Doctor Lovegood. The medic and resident doctor of the heroes, Doctor Lovegood is the wildly weird yet fun Doctor of the group, who helps heals her teammate's injuries as much as she uses her medicine and her notorious Needler gun as weapons against evil. A curvaceous woman, few years younger than her sister, with long brown hair and deep brown eyes, but pale skin also. She is a former student of the great Doctor O'Reily, a.k.a General Rubber who unfortunately had a mental breakdown and became the twisted villain he is today. As such, he is her arch-nemesis, though she believes with the right medication, she can bring back to his sense. **Viper:** A ragamuffin mutant who was born on the harsh streets, Viper a.k.a Bradley Jr. Ridley is nether the less the most friendly and warm member of the group, and that's saying something. A charitable and welcoming young man with a heart of gold, his mutant genes meant he was born with venomous fangs, razor sharp claws, altered skeletal scripture and his iconic scales and tail, resembling that of a man fused with a lizard. Due to this, he has often felt stigmatised and outcasted all of his life, though he still dedicates himself to helping and saving the citizens of the city. Tall, strong and broad with large muscles, by physical strength alone Viper is intimidating, but when you add his super fast speed and reflexes, as well as natural poison, he's a born-killer turned hero. His arch nemesis is the dreaded Shadow, due to her attempt on his life multiple times. But on who's orders? **Elastica:** Jessica Riggs, Sister of Survivor and daughter of The Master and Amazing Ace, was born with mutated abilities due to her mother's own enhanced ones, mainly, that of being able to stretch body to any size, great or small, long or short. As a result, she has decided to use her own powers to become a hero like her mother and brother, looking up to both as the youngest. Her appearance is similar to her mother's, albeit thinner and shorter. Due to her power and ability to 'out-strech' an opponent, The Master decided to pit Replicator against her. After all, if one man can't handle her, then why send just one? **Survivor:** Brother of Jessica Riggs, son of The Master and Amazing Ace, Survivor, birth name James Riggs, takes much of both personalities. The heroism and courage of his mother, but also the broody and dark nature of his father. His special ability is of that of being able to change to whatever his surroundings are, wether that be deep underwater, high in the sky or even deep in space. As such, he is near invincible in most situations, though whenever he 'adapts' to one element, he is weak to another, so he must be careful. Due to his power, he is able to survive any surrounding, and as such, has worked as an elite trooper in many militaries amongst the world, before finally taking the mantle of Super Hero like his aunt, mother and sister. He is considered arch-nemesis by the Counsellor, who wishes to learn a way to control and harness his power, by any means necessary. **Chipmonk:** The pint-sized ninja that goes only by the name of ""Chipmonk"" is something of a mystery to the rest of the heroes, but is still considered a hero regardless. A strange woman, young in age, and appearance resembling that of a squirrel like girl dressed in the garbs of a ninja or a samurai, she is honour bound, both to protect innocents and to battle great evil. She is a master of stealth, chi manipulation, but is more commonly known for her prowess with dual katanas. Her arch-nemesis is King Koruption, an enemy so foul that she considers to be the most evil being on the planet, and won't rest until dead. **Solar:** Twins Solar and Lunar represent old gods worshipped long ago by the two aztec tribes. One worshipping the sun, and adoring all that is good in the world, while the other worshipped the moon, and worshipped darkness and evil. Two boys, twins with parents from different tribes, were sacrificed to said gods to become their representatives on Earth. Despite this happening thousands of years ago, the brothers maintain the appearance of that of young, attractive men, androgynous and beautiful. Solar, capable of flight and having complete control of the power of the sun, is arch-nemesis to his brother, though the two love each other dearly, they are destined to fight to the death. Solar has golden orange skin, bright blonde hair and glowing yellow eyes, with a slim body. **Miss Information:** A strange eccentric, follower of the occult and general odd person. Professor Dubois, more commonly known as Miss Information, serves as the hero's advisor in all things paranormal, especially that of ghosts, the undead, and cults. A former cultist herself, Miss Information turned her back on her wicked ways in order to use her knowledge and powers for good. Her powers, given to her by years of studying magic, include banishing the dead, mediumship and telepathy. She is the arch-nemesis of Banshee, a monster she accidentally helped release onto the world, as is committed to sending the undead queen back to her grave, one way or another. Miss Information is a woman of voluptuous stature, average sized, with dark black hair and bright grey eyes, pale in skin. **Alexander:** Every two thousand years, a great individual is chosen by the Pantheon to be their representatives on Earth, a being of enhanced strength, leadership, charisma and intelligence, as well as the divine magic of lightning, and this being is known as Alexander. In our history, however, they have been known as various names. Alexander the Great being one, but also Napoleon, Jesus Christ and Julius Caesar. The current Alexander, who simply goes by his chosen name rather than birth, decided to use his power for good, and to serve the people rather than to conquer them. A powerful and handsome man with glowing blue eyes, his arch nemesis is the dreaded Medusa, an ancient Gorgon who seeks to enslave all men. **Blueberry:** Coming from a distant plant, deep within the Milky Way, Blueberry, as she is known amongst her hero friends, is a powerful but friendly Alien being with exaggerated curves, strengths and looks. She is something of the teaser of the group, romantically vicarious and promiscuous as well, she does her best to protect the people regardless. Her skin ranges from purple to bright blue, hence her nickname, and she stands tall for a female, around 6ft or over, with heavy breasts and a juicy round rear, making her amongst the curviest and most sexually attractive of the heroes. Her arch-nemesis is considered Insectoid, who considers her prime material to mate with, even if against her will, and this is a goal he is obsessive to achieve. Her powers include super strength, speed, agility and endurance, but she also commands the power of psionics, like all her race do, and can lift objects with her mind alone. **Voodoo:** Cursed with the gift of immortality, Voodoo, birth name Jean Baptiste was a former slave on the Haitian colony during the 1700s, before revolting and overthrowing the French colonisers. This victory was short, however, as the young general one day ventured into the jungles of Haiti, attempted to loot from the ancient crypts there and was soon cursed with both great and terrible abilities. Now half dead and half living, he is a living avatar for the Loa, and is in a constant battle to fight this evil within and to use the powers given to him for good. His powers are wide ranging, including control over the dead, power of dark spells and immortal life. His Arch-Nemesis is Pharaoh, a similar undead being, who he considers to be evil and immoral. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Villains:** Whilst the heroes used their great powers to protect the city, Villains use their power selfishly, either to improve their own lives or to conquer over others. All top 20 villains are considered extremely dangerous and should only be apprehended by their hero counterparts. Be warned. **Temptress:** A dreaded and loved creature in equal measure. Somewhere between a spider and that of a human, Temptress uses her ability of charm and seduction to lure innocent victims into her lair, where they are either used as food for her children or captured for their sperm for her to make more of her spiderlings to spread across the city. Highly hypnotic and powerful, she is equally beautiful as she is deadly. Her arch-nemesis is Milk Tank, though the two are rather flirty with each other. She is curvaceous, with dark blue hair and obsidian black eyes, with many glowing red irises. **The Mighty Python:** A former, wimpy tribe member of a war-like tribe deep in the heart of Africa, Mamadou's life forever changed when he was bitten by the horrific Mighty Python, a snake which grants the user great power, but great curses as well. A noble warrior who is forced to be driven by his urges, he soon took his weak tribe and transformed it into a powerful mercenary company which operates across the world. In the day time, he is the respectable CEO of said business, but when night comes, he is driven into his alter ego, The Mighty Python, driven to a violent lust and desire to conquer all. His arch-nemesis is Jungle Julie, who was once a member of the nearby tribe, a tribe which has constantly defeated Python's tribe again and again. Despite this, the two warriors have great respect, and attraction, to each other. Python's powers include incredible physical strength, charisma, regeneration and speed, as well as massive stamina. He is extremely tall, muscular and dark skinned, with long flowing hair that is braided. **Miss Sanguis:** An evil being dated back to medieval times, Miss Sanguis is something of that of either a demoness or a vampire, or perhaps both. Beautiful as she is deadly, her mastery of both unholy magic and physical combat makes her something to be deeply afraid of. Curvaceous, with jet black hair, glowing red eyes and crimson skin, She is the arch-nemesis of her long-term enemy, Shining Light, though there is great sexual tension between the two, and perhaps even forbidden romance. **General Rubber:** Perhaps the most demented and insane of all of the super villains, General Rubber, a.k.a. Doctor O' Reily was once a great and respected scientist, but one day, a mishap with a new material was inventing caused a dire mistake which caused both a mental breakdown within his mind and also a physical dependence on this new material. This new material, similar to that of latex, but *living*, attached itself to his body, giving him super strength, speed and even more intelligence, at the cost of his sanity and morals. Now a demented pervert who rules over a 'Rubber Army', he kidnaps victims across the city to be transformed into his dolls and soldiers. His arch-nemesis is his former student, Doctor Lovegood, who he plans to turn into his own 'Rubber bride' to rule the city with, much to her displeasure. He is a tall, powerful figure, the material re-arranging his previous weakly body into a powerful man. **Rage:** Daughter of King Koruption and member of an alien race of beings, Rage is very similar to her brethren and sisters, in the fact that she has immense physical strength and stamina, near limitless, which is only fuelled further by intense rage. However, despite her villain status, it could be argued that Rage is more of a brat or simple thug than anything else, a rebellious young woman who simply wishes to live her life free of the influence of her father and also free of her angry emotions, she is nether the less someone to be careful around, especially when she's angry. Her skin is a light red when in her neutral state, and bright red when angry, the same goes for her hair and eye colour. Her build is slender and curvy but short-ish, but grows to immense size (both in strength, height and curves) when angered. Her arch-nemesis is Iron Rod, a man she is admittedly in love with due to his strength, as she could only love a man who could beat her in physical combat. Rage escaped the wars of her home planet to get away from her father, who soon followed after her. **The Master:** The Master is the leader of all the villains, and is something of the brains of the team. Evil to the core, or seen as such, he is a cruel Social Darwinist who believes the weak are only good as slaves and that the strong deserve to rule. Real name Richard King, and long ago, whilst still hiding his life, he was the husband of Amazing Ace. He desired to slowly corrupt her to side of evil, however, she soon found out his criminal side, and left him, as well as taking his two children. His only weakness, as such is his family. His powers aren't really powers at all, he is a 'simple' human who pushes his abilities every day, pushing his body to peak strength, his mind to peak intelligence, and so on. His wealth is perhaps the greatest sign of his strength, and his many businesses (fronts to his evil nature). He also hold a huge slave army to do his bidding, each one fully broken under his command. His arch-nemesis is his counter-part leader and ex-wife, Amazing Ace. The Master has long dark hair, has somewhat tanned skin but an otherwise gloomy and gothic look, his son, James Riggs, taking much of his appearance. **Bombshell:** A feisty and eager young, small woman, perhaps of either Dwarven or Gnomish history, Bombshell, true name unknown, is an explosives obsessed mercenary who will work for anyone for the right price. Her cheery and friendly behaviour matches her childish and immature personality, as well as total lack of morals. Despite this, she is an excellent former soldier of physical excellent and mastery of all weapons, especially that of explosives. Her arch-nemesis is The Hunter, the two respecting each other's skills as soldiers, though they would never admit it. She is rather curvy for a short girl, a shortstack so to speak, and has ginger pigtails and bright green eyes. **Kraken:** Kraken is perhaps one of the most powerful villains in the city, and is amongst their most ancient. A being as old as time itself, Kraken is a monstrous being, not human at all, but an ancient alien hidden deep beneath the sea, who now walks amongst land. He has incredibly physical strength and intelligence, but is more known for his master of the dark arts. Resembling that of a fish-like being, he has various forms, his 'human' one resembling some freakish human with diseased, watery skin and ice like cold blood. His forms only get more grotesque, however, his second being that of a human body put an octopus for a head, and his final is this beast but far larger, a god amongst men even. His arch-nemesis is Magenta, who is dedicated to stopping the foul beast throughout time. **Shadow:** A shadowy figure, hence her name, gifted with the mutations of invisibility and heightened reflexes, Shadow is amongst the most notorious assassins in the world, and no job is too cruel or immoral for her. A former high born member of society, Shadow soon turned her life on that world when she was rejected for her developing mutations. As revenge, her first contract was that of her whole family, which she was happy to take. Burning her family home to the ground, Shadow headed to New Central City, where she has made a lucrative lifestyle for herself. Her arch-nemesis is Viper, being hired to kill him a few times. Her anger only increases when he keeps getting away. Perhaps she was *allowing* him to get away, and perhaps she even held attraction for this man? Who knows. It is hard to say what she truly looks like, but she is believed to be incredibly beautiful, with long jet black hair and sparkling blue eyes, and a slender but curvy body. **Tin-Man:** Teased as a child for his severe case of Polio, 'Tin-Man', a.k.a Doctor Zhu is an elderly man, an immigrant from China during the second World War. He was mercilessly bullied by the people at school, his teachers, his peers, even his own family, which caused him to withdraw from society and focus on his love in life, Electronics, but more importantly, Robotics. However, Polio got the better of him, and was soon about to kill him. Trying one last experiment, Doctor Zhu transported his brain into that of an immensely powerful and intimidating robot, and, much to his own surprise, it succeeded. Now a brain in a jar connected to a robotic body, Doctor Zhu took his school nickname and made it his title, the Tin-Man, the heartless monster who would take revenge against a world so cruel to him. He would hide his brain between two bodies, one, Tin-Man, and two, a recreation of his youthful body, to hide amongst the public as a caring doctor. Despite his vengeful nature, he still holds a deep sympathy for those who bullied, or 'broken' as he was long ago. Case in hand, his adopted daughter, Celestia, who he 'fixed' and raised from a young girl to a teenager. When she found out about his evil nature, however, she casted him aside and joined the heroes. Likewise, she is his arch-nemesis, but the two are truly unable to hurt each other due to their fatherly-daughterly relationship. **The Counsellor:** A former therapist and psychological expert, The Counsellor, also known as Robin Banks, found more power in using her power of mind manipulation for evil, rather than good. She's done every role from interrogator, to brainwasher, to even therapist to the villains (hey, everyone needs one), but she is only truly in it for her own power and wealth. Holding no powers of her own, she is still someone not to trust or to underestimate by any means, her manipulation and use of powerful medicine is great, and she is capable of controlling even the most powerful heroes to bend to her will. The Counsellor's arch-nemesis is that of Survivor, more so out of her own scientific interest of his power, and attempts to turn him into her personal servant. She is incredibly beautiful, which she uses for her advantage, and has a highly fertile and beautiful body as well. **Slimeball:** Elder brother of Jelly Boy, where as Jelly is friendly and thoughtful, Slimeball is mean and selfish. He's a typical bully, a thug, in it for himself only and cares little for others. Rather than use his power for good, he uses it to get what he wants, running an organised but lowly group of thugs in the sewers for various schemes. His own powers, much like his brothers, allow him to warp and change his body. Whilst his brother's substance is more 'solid', so to speak, Slimeball is more slimy (surprisingly so), leaving a trail behind him much like a snail would. Many fear to touch him and find him rather repulsive, no doubt adding to his anger of them. His arch-nemesis is his brother, though it is more out of sibling rivalry than anything else. **Banshee:** Once a tyrannically and evil queen of some European country long ago, so evil that she was stricken from the records, Banshee, real name unknown, is the wrathful spirit and body of said queen, awakened from her eternal slumber to strike revenge on the world. Awakened by accident by a clumsy Miss Information, Banshee desires to bring this world to an end due to her intense hate of it. Banshee hold's two forms, that of a beautiful and seductive woman, much like she was when alive, and that of a hallowed out near-dead decayed body, horrifying to observe. Her powers include control over the dead, her terrifying screams and dark magic. Her arch-nemesis is Miss Information, who she wishes to award for waking her from her sleep and freeing her. With the gift of death, of course. **Lunar:** Lunar, being the twin brother of Solar, matches his appearance totally before their sacrifice. The two are still identical, save for some changes. Where as Solar has golden skin, Lunar's is silver like the moon. His hair is a bright white, and eyes are also silvery in tone. Whilst his brother has the power of sunlight, Lunar commands darkness, even the shadows itself. He is not evil per se, though he revels in darkness and feeds of the negative emotions of people. As such, he has his own cult dedicated to him, which captures and inflicts pain on others to give their dark god more strength. As guess, his arch-nemesis is Solar, two polar opposites despite their twin status. **Medusa:** The ancient monster of times long before, Medusa is a Gorgon who is capable of petrifying both men and women alike. She is capable of not just turning them to stone, but controlling them too, as well as in control of powerful magic and physical abilities. The old time enemy of Alexander and his predecessors, she is dedicated to destroying him and enslaving all men and women alike under her evil reign. She is a voluptuous female, with grey skin, dark eyes and snakes for hair, much to the terror of those who see her. As guessed, her arch-nemesis is Alexander. **Insectoid:** A twisted being from another planet, Insectioid, his real name too difficult for humans to say, is a bloodthirsty insect like monster (Similar to that of a Praying Mantis) who has gone as far as to add cybernetics to himself to increase power. Always referring to himself in third person, Insectoid is rather basic in his desires, allowing him to be easily manipulated. Despite this, his strength and abilities, such as flight, venom and razor sharp claws, make him something to fear. He desires, first and foremost, to mate, at an almost constant need, to add more of his children to the world, which make up as his own soldiers. As such, his ideal goal, his obsession even, is with the alien Blueberry, who he strongly desires to breed with, even if it's against her will. **Zev:** Sister to Jax, like his brother, Zev is a shape shifting alien, capable of changing her appearance to any of that of a 'sentient' being such as a human, which she uses often to manipulate and control people, as well as to infiltrate and seduce. Something of a personal spy to The Master, Zev is an arrogant alien who looks down on most of humanity, and believes it to be her right, and that of her people, to conquer earth for her ravaged home planet in hopes to bring back the glory days of her people. She is very attractive, curvy in all the right places, and like her brother, possesses deep green skin, obsidian eyes and jet black hair. Understandably, her arch-nemesis is her brother, who she considers a brat more than an enemy. **Replicator:** A arrogant and narcissistic young mutant man, Alfred Russo uses his powers of 'replication' to make copies of himself at will, each as physically powerful and as clever as he is. Because of this, Replicator rarely needs his own gang members, often using his own 'men' to do his dirty work. He is a tall, good looking male in every way, very fit and dark haired with dark eyes. His arch-nemesis is Elastica, due to his boss, The Master, ordering him to take her own, his unique ability able to subdue her elastic powers. **Pharaoh:** Born into the Egyptian aristocracy, Pharaoh, birth name not given, was an Egyptian priestess who used her own position for power, lust and dark, forbidden magics. She planned to over throw her brother to take the kingdom for herself, but was soon stopped. Cruelly, her punishment was a fate worse than death, to be mummified *alive* and locked inside hidden pyramids until the end of time. Luckily for her, a recent earthquake broke her free, and she soon set course for the biggest city on the planet to start her new reign. Despite her grizzly 'demise', she maintains the appearance of a beautiful, young Egyptian woman, ample and curvy despite her mummy-like threads. Despite her cruelty, she is a warm and humorous woman, and holds a close friendship to Banshee due to their similar origins. Her arch-nemesis is Voodoo, who made it his personal mission to stop her goals. **King Koruption:** Finally, there is King Korruption, the most physically powerful of all the villains, father of the angsty Rage. Where as his daughter rejects her heritage and seeks for more in life, King Korruption revels in violence and war, especially hand to hand combat, and has managed to keep himself in a near state of rage, causing near-deafness to those who have put up with his screaming for so long. Around the size of 12 foot, he is a mammoth of a sentient being, his skin burning red like the fires of hell. As his name implies, he is the king of his people, and came to Earth to bring back his daughter, but soon found a new world to conquer. His arch-nemesis is the puny Chipmonk, who seeks to stop his destructive war at every step he makes. --------------------------------------------- The commander logged out of the screen, it must've took him a few hours to read each one in-depth. ""I'm getting too old for this shit."" ------------------------------------------------ Hey there, thanks for reading so far! This prompt is something of an 'introductory' prompt to the series of them I plan to make, each one episodic, so to speak. To summarise, the city of New Central is massive, like *really* big, so big that many villains rise in the gaps of power to control the city. Who else would be needed but super heroes to stop said menaces? I've left the plot rather vague for now, I want people both to get an idea of the characters, either picking one or two to play or even making their own (that'd be super interesting!) and then we can think of an idea together for a story. Though I sexualised a few of the heroes, I like the idea of a lot of them being non-sexualised. That's not to say they aren't *sexual* but it is to say it adds some 'realism' (so to speak) to the prompt instead of ""he he my super power is big boner"", though some of the heroes and villains are a bit like that... I added the nemesis part to each character in order to both give a sense of relationship and also maybe for some ideas of where to start. Of course, it doesn't have to be 'Good guy vs Bad guy' each time. Why not explore the dynamics between two heroes? Or two villains? Why not have it so one 'good guy' turns bad, and vice versa? **Likewise, I'm very open to the idea of gender swapping the characters, so if you like the character's powers/description but not their gender, we can swap it round, no big deal!** It goes without saying (due to A4A tag) that I am happy to play either characters, female or male, though I should say I heavily prefer playing the submissive role over dom. I'd love to hear people's ideas for stories and what not, but don't worry, I have a few in mind. It's more important you decide which characters you wish us to play with, really. In terms of my expectations, people who can write are obviously something of a must, one-lined sentences need not apply, though I value creativity and quality over pure length. Likewise, though I am very kinky, vanilla people aren't barred, as I feel the setting is interesting enough to have some fun. Below is the link to my DPP profile, where you can find my kinks, limits, etc. Hope to hear from you soon! URL"

Remember a few years back when they had cameras on every street corner and all these shitty green-blue holograms shimmering in front of everything? And the *static* in the VR systems, and what chucklefuck decided that bringing back CRT monitors would be a *good* thing? Thank *fuck* we're a lot more sensible now - the governments and megacorps seem to have got the memo that a swingin' society is a safe and spendthrift society, and so our world today is just plain *groovy.* Come, take a wander into my abode - the melodious drift of some old-school Barry White drifts from the holo-record player spinning like rich molasses in the corner, and wood-paneled, smooth-swept neoplastic furniture *everywhere* atop the faint sway of a decadently plush shag carpet. The shag walls and shag ceiling might be a bit much, but that's what the cleaning drone's for, really. Anyway, you're probably asking yourself, ""what's this impossibly-suave gent in a crisp suit and paisley tie wanting? Just *who* is he looking for?"" Sidle on over into this alcove, where the mirrored ball spins enticingly overhead - true, we don't *need* holograms playing over its surface, but it's *cool* like that.

I'm looking for a partner in crime to go on a ... a run, let's say. Someone equally at home in the flow of bits and *using* her bits, someone to help me solve a *mystery*. I can't say much more before we take the first full-dive together, but I'm not picky - a street-smart young punk longing for something a little *more*, if you know what I mean, is just as welcome as a surprisingly-sentient sex-synth in a waist-zipped catsuit.

I have a predisposition for exotic settings and equally exotic characters, pulling inspiration from nearly every genre of literature and the weird landscape of my own mind. Finally, I possess a veritable armada of fantasies and fetishes each of which I so dearly wish to satiate. Know that I am not easily shocked and appreciate blunt honesty when sharing any and all of your deep seeded carnal instincts. Very few limits will impede our shared sexual exploration and deviance. Still interested? Good! Know that of all the things I seek in a partner the ability to be fearlessly creative is the single trait I value the most. Know that I have many settings, characters and plot hooks I can offer freely to spark us off, but, also know that I thrill in discovering anothers deep seeded fantasies. Furthermore, know that I adore world building and would be happy to spend my afternoon doing just, crafting an idea from a spark to a blaze; after all what we build together with passion and flare will undoubtedly lead us towards a splendidly messy finale.

It wont be long until the spark of mutual lusts ignite passions as quick to burn out of control as a rampaging brush fire, wanton need escalating beyond the bounds of the taboo. A shared sexual awakening certain to change the lives of this daddy, daughter team. Settling in to the new paradigm of their relationship the taboo couple might just discover what one might consider the best possible use of their Companys profits, a top-end suite of his and her body improvements exploring the realms of genetic manipulation, cyber-ware, cutting edge organic enhancements and enthusiast implants.

40,cyber crime,dirtypenpals,"21 [F4A] Hey babe, take a walk on the weird side! (Lots and lots of scenes/prompts inside!)",5,6cbqcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6cbqcz/21_f4a_hey_babe_take_a_walk_on_the_weird_side/,2017-05-21 03:59:50,"Hey there! Female with strange username here. I've been around RP's for a while, talking to people, having some great scenes but ultimately, they fall apart. They tend to be too.. normal, too realistic, in some part. After all, without sounding too judgemental, if you can do a scene online, why not in person? I came to the conclusion, that the ideas, scenarios, whatever you want to call them, that I love the most are the ones you just couldn't do in real life. Where fantasy meets eroticism, this interests me most! So, as my name implies, i'm looking for more 'out there' partners, stories that can be long and detailed, or short and intense, female or male, as long as the idea is something more 'unusual', i'm interested. Hence, the username. Let Dr Bizarre (yes i'm aware I spelt my username wrong) take you into her weird little world, a perfect mixture of kinky and imagination (come with me.. and you'll see..) Bit about me. I'm 21 years old, from the U.K., but that's all not THAT important (unless you like cuckolding..) generally speaking, within reason, I love playing a wide range of ages (legal of course), and etc etc. I'm kinky as Sodom and Gomorra, but not totally turned off at romanticism! (Vanilla though? Blegh..) I looove darker scenes, but light-hearted ones can be a joy also. In terms of writing style, I tend to adapt who I talk to. The more 'storied' the scenario the more I write. I'm not going to write 5 paragraphs about how the curtains were a curious shade of crimson as a penis pumps into me, likewise though, i'm not going to write a simple one sentence reply, or at least try not to, I try to maintain somewhere between these two. **What i'm looking for:** So generally speaking, i'm looking for fun, kinky and open minded people who love trying out (or showing me!) new ideas and stories. People who are comfortable writing but at the same time realise that this isn't an essay, and fun should still be at the heart of it! A paragraph to three paragraphs is plenty for a reply, a super long intro (or even outro) is pretty normal too so that's fine also! I myself write between this much, sadly I feel i'm much better of thinking of ideas than executing them.. doesn't stop me though. I loove a good plot/story, something that'll keep me coming back even when i'm not horny! At the same time though, I admit there's a few ideas on here (i.e. most) that are just always dirty, and are more about how kinky can you be rather than plot! INCOMING LIST OF KINKS (I really need to do a kink list..): BDSM, bondage, latex, humiliation, degradation, piss/scat, petplay, non-con/dubcon sex work, ageplay (the legal kind, DDlg, diapers, pacifiers, etc), anal, rimming, face sitting, lingerie, high heels, leather, body worship, gang bangs/group sex, femdom (gentle and heavy), public, feet, bimbo/bimbofication, scent-play, ass worship/ass sniffing, stepfordication, misogny/misandry, interracial, raceplay, force feeding, body mod, lactation, tattoos, piercings, branding, cheating/cuckolding, breeding, incest, unrealistic body sizes, inflation (note huge), cuckold, breeding/impregnation, lactation, piercings, branding, tattoos, cumplay, forced orgasm/orgasm denial, sex machinery, and so on. My limits are gore, vomiting, vore, messy play, necrophilia and blood. I'm sure i've missed out some kinks, please let me know yours so I can add some to my future list! So, without further ado, here's my ideas. I'm going to put them in categories because there's so many right now, and will probably be more in the future. As said early, i'm looking for something a bit more 'unusual' and story based too. I'm not a fan of 'normal' RPs (offices, mom and neighbour's son, teacher and student.. done them to death, to be honest) nor am I fan of scenarios based on existing fiction, which i'm never that much to grips with (although I don't mind stuff *influenced* by said things, as you'll find I have in my ideas below) Some of these ideas can fit into more than one category, and please, if you want to mix any of them up, let me know. **Fantasy/Medieval** Fantasy World: Generic as FUCK but we love it. Sort of basing more on World of Warcraft world/LotR sort of thing, bit of D&amp;D why not, but sort of something on it's own too, let's world build together! No specific ideas for this in mind, this is a very open ended scenario. Orcs on elf girl? Sure? Humans on orc girls? Why not? A war? Forbidden romance? Nymphs? Dwarves? (hint: I ain't playing a fucking female dwarf) Demons? Angels? Centaurs? Goblins? Trolls? Orges? (GET OUT OF MY SWAMP) Satyrs? Let's go crazy with this one. Prince/Princess: A bit of a standard one, but who doesn't want to be a princess/prince every now and then? This is one I could see easily working either roles (Me Princess or serving a prince), and many ideas spring from this. Prince/princess buys a slave, or they get kidnapped by state enemies, or they willingly fall into a secret fetish cult, etc etc! Hell: Yes, actual hell! Demons, perhaps Monsters of some kind! The idea of someone being in hell *when they shouldn't be* is even more fun, although for those with a heart of gold, doing something sadistic to someone who perhaps deserves it may relieve some stress off of your mind! Fallen Angel: A take on the prior idea, perhaps? An angel who has been casted out of Heaven (or similar in likeness). Perhaps they had left willingly, after their own naivety. Despite there powers, they may find the physical plane more difficult than thought. Rule of the 'Beastmen': So i'll get this of my chest. I'm not much of a furry person, although I don't judge others for liking them. Especially stuff like the fur suits. But, Beastmen? On a human? That's kind of fucking hot.. This idea panders more the idea of maybe kidnapped human, or a kingdom under siege by beastmen, etc etc. For those of you who don't know, Beastmen are basically furries lol but TOUGH and MEAN and SCARY and shit. Vampires, and Werewolves, and Vampires!: Doesn't have to be the two together, just saves me some extra text lmao. So yeah, vampires, sort of a common staple in teenage fan-fiction (fuck twilight), not the biggest turn on of mine, but something i'd try out! I've always liked the more traditional, evil-but-charismatic sort of vampires (Bram Stoker, Ann Rice, Folk Lore, Vampire: The Masquerade, even Legacy of Kain) rather than the sparkled up pretty guys. The idea of being kept as a vampire's feeding slave is pretty hot won't lie. Werewolves a sort of similar thing, verging on furries at times but not really? Brutal, savage, pretty hot if also totally fucking dangerous. Sure we can think of a few ideas with both of these. Set in the past, set in modern era, etc etc. Amazonian Tribe: Didn't know wether to put this as historical or fantasy but the Amazonian are *mythical* and not real, so.. But yeah, who doesn't love giant, curvy powerful women who could not the living shit out of any man? Does anyone else sense a sort of femdom idea here, or is that just me? Maybe a lost explorer is taken by the tribe to be a loving husband for a wife.. sounds fun. Cult of Zod: Occultism, Satanism, sounds like a jolly good time to summon some demons and/or procure some dark magic! Okay real talk I love occultism in real life so this is a cool one with me. Also who doesn't find the whole sex cult look such a turn on? Robes, piercing, esoteric tattoo, demons, I did say it was 'out there'. Evil Wizard: Hiding in their tower, the evil Wizard plots cruel, magical plans for the poor victims of the hamlet/city/castle below. Maybe they plan on transforming their victim? Or setting their new 'pet' on them? Think Mad Scientist, but with *m a g i c* The Witches Coven: Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn, and caldron bubble! A secret gathering in the woods, an underground movement, maybe even a secret elite amongst the female nobles of said world, this one's all about witches. Could be they are find out and sent to the 'interrogator' but I was thinking more about the Witches/Witch getting their way.. bit more of a femdom one this, gentle or hard. The Bluebeard Baron: Not a nice guy, Bluebeard. A rich noble in a french folk legend, he would continuously marry young girls, and they would somehow go missing.. only to be found under the cellar of his castle. A pretty dark story, but this one is a little.. uh, lighter. I mean, they'll be no murder, but the idea of a rich, cruel (maybe magically inclined) Baron having his pick of girls for his own purposes? Sounds delightfully dark. The Holy Inquisitor: One of the highest of your order, or a new fledgling Paladin, you take immense pride in your job, ridding the world of demonic evil, and it's magical remains. Wether by force, or well, force, you'll do anything to help a fellow in need of eradicating dark forces from the planet. You're next assignment is no different than another. But do you do take more spoils home than you should this time? Or do you give in to your temptation, as the foul demoness in front of you did not seem so foul at the time.. **Sci-Fi:** It came from Outer Space!: Ooooh, aliiiieeens! I've always been a firm believer in aliens (I WANT TO BELIEVE) and this and that, although I admit, from a sexual point of view, i'm more fond on the more *humanoid* aliens rather than Za-glob, the mass tentacles of blobs from Planet 718 and that sort of thing. Maybe a UFO crash (thinking Roswell sort of thing here, 50's America), or human abducted for a space zoo, or perhaps for a pet, that sort of thing. Can I keep him?: Okay, maybe we can do tentacles too! It's not something I used to like, but grown into a little. I was thinking for this, as the title implies, a girl finds a little alien on her way back to her home (or an egg, that looks normal at the time..) wanting to keep it as a pet. Little did she know just how big these things can get. Maybe it's a mindless beast that simply acts on it's hormones, maybe it's a sentient being that's looking for a 'Queen', which will be able to plant many eggs! Forced is workable here, but the term 'constentacles' is just too cute not to be used here either! Maybe she keeps *him* *because* of that reason. Space Pirates: Man, who doesn't love space pirates. They're pirates.. In space! That's so fucking cool. Can do either roles for this one, either Space Pirate and their hostages, a sort of space cops n' robbers scenario, maybe some romance between the captain and a crew member, it's the love boat but *set in space!* City XOX: G e n e r i c s c i - f i n a m e but in all seriousness I quite like the idea of the Shadowrun, Neuromancer cyber-punk world, it's an interesting niche within it's own. Sci-fi *and* dystopias? Sign me the fuck up. Can do a lot with this one, more based on setting than ideas, really. I think this one would go well mixed with a few other ideas or kinks listed already, so go crazy. Fall of the Super-heroine/Superhero: So, i'm not a big Marvel kind of girl, or DC, in fact, except from a few comics, i'm not a big comic person really (batman is cool though). But I love the idea of a fallen superhero, one who was the pride of the city, or nation, only to be trapped by her arch nemesis and degraded each day by him. Can do this vice versa of course, must be so fun being a supervillian, muhahahah. Can be a fallen supervillian as well! For those who prefer their punishment to be a bit more on the 'justice' side than 'perverted'. Post-Apocalyptic: Straight out of a Fallout of this. A world ravaged, many years passed, etc etc, blah blah. This one can be pretty dark, i'd imagine, with no law, and every man for himself in the ruthless, barren wasteland. Of course, it could be more consensual, could be there's more law and the world's not so fucked up, but let's go with what you like. A vaults? Seems pretty fun to me also. Slut in the Shell: Not too subtle of a reference there. Sexbots, Androids, Gynoids, Cyborgs, let's go really tech-y with this one. A world where anyone can have any body they desire, but it is *really* there body? It may feel like skin, but if it doesn't bleed, is it human? And then there's the risks of being hacked.. or the people people who are forced into their new robotics bodies. Of course, instead of cyborgs, we can do Androids, built for many purposes, but can they be human? Getting **deep** here, duuuude. Enlightened Species: A long forgotten powerful species recently discovered by humans, in space or on earth? Or maybe you're a delegate to meet with an outer species for the first time. Perhaps we, the Enlightened, have come hoping to help humanity. Perhaps he have come with less benevolent goals.. A tasty idea for this one would be the corruption of a said person of the Species, maybe my spaceship crashes near a strip club, only for the humans to take advantage of me. Can I fuck it?: For those Mass Effect fans out there, this one will be following in the footsteps of the intergalactic casanova, Shepard, with the same question at hand. If there's an alien species, can you fuck it? Perhaps your a strapping rogue, seducing innocent alien princesses, or a space commander with a cold heart only your alien subordinate can warm. Or perhaps your a space pimp, looking for only the finest of women across the whole universe to serve in your harem! **Historical/Geographical:** 'Exotica' (Orient, Middle East, Africa, South America etc): Kind of a basic one? I don't know where I was going with this.. But I was thinking tourist maybe, maybe a diplomatic delegate, a holiday resort, that sort of thing. A little bit on the vanilla side, but i'm sure we can spruce it up a bit. Western World: HOWDY Y'ALL now i've never been hugely into cowboys and what not, although it's a pretty interesting history, and I think we can do a few things with this. Outlaw on the run, the little whore house, a vicious gang versus a lawmaker, that sort of thing. Doesn't have to be set in the past either, if we want to get a bit sci-fi with it we can always go for that sort of Borderland/Firefly vibe A Gentleman's Maid: Victorian era, probably one of the most aesthetically stunning and important eras yet so god damn shitty for so many people. Still, it did bring us something we all love and know. Maids! Who doesn't love a traditional Victorian or French maid with their sexy outfits, demure manners (or not so demure..) and willingness to serve *any way they can*? Can be on the light hearted side this one, or way dark. Forced into the Tribe: So this one is a bit similar to the amazonian tribe idea, and the exotic idea, except the shoe will be on the other foot now. Be it a wandering tourist off the beaten path, or an intrepid explorer, in the past or modern era, either sounds good. The idea of being the chief's wife is such a turn on, although the tribe's fucktoy doesn't sound bad either.. Antiquity (Roman Empire, Greece, Persia): THE BEST ERA YOU CAN'T DENY IT I love the Roman Empire so much, it's so interesting to me, i've always been a big fan even as a kid. And now, as a perverted adult, I can appreciate just how perverted these guys were. Orgies, Sex gods (Greece), slaves, excess wine, what's not to love? The Harem: Thinking more of a Middle-Eastern/Turkish/North African idea with this one, the Prince or wealthy merchant and his large harem, lots of fun, quite literally in this case. Of course, can be reverted, a princess and her harem, perhaps? Rare, and pretty much never happened in history (as far as i'm aware, except with Catherine the Great probably) but could be fun! The Crusades: Ahhh, controversial scenario time. The Crusades are and were pretty bloody, pretty horrific on both sides, but pretty interesting also (considering how many there were). Still, could be fun idea for a scene. You a crusader, me a wife of your slain enemy, or me an innocent nun, you one of Saladin's men.. you get the idea here. Dark, but doesn't have to be really. Horsemen: Also known as the Mongols, the Scythian, pre-ottoman Turks, the Huns, a generally wide group of people often attributed as 'Horsemen' through out history. A migrating tribe and empire, could be you have just sieged my city, looking for new plunder, or perhaps vice versa. For this perverted, Pony play comes to mind.. Pirates: Do what you want cause a pirate is free! I've loved Pirates since I was a child, such an interesting period in a time where ideas such as Liberty and Free Will were being chucked around, only to be endorsed by absolute, but loveable, scoundrels. A neat mix of cultures too. Chinese pirates? Pirates off the coast of America? The Caribbean? Barbary? Can do a lot here! Viking's Whore: So how are Vikings *not* pirates again? But anyway, for those of you who want to play the thor-worshipping, europa-pillaging, mead-drinking beasts of Northern Europe, this would be a good chance! I was thinking a recent victim of a viking pillage, who was thought to make a better slave or wife than held for ransom, would be interesting. New World Tribe: I was thinking a sort of Aztec-y vibe with this one, with either myself as an explorer who discovers this lost people, or you the in the same capacity, myself a high priestess in my people's religion. And you'd do anything to get yourself away from the sacrificial pyramids.. Samurai and Ninjas: Edo period, also known as the Shogun era, or the rise of the Bushido. Be it a hyper-realistic setting, or maybe an alternative take in which females could be Samurai as well (maybe a different world all together..) I don't have that many specific idea for this one, nor do I admit to having lots of knowledge about Japanese history, but always willing to learn, and of course, have fun! And don't forget the ninjas too. **Modern/Just plain Dark:** Organised Crime Lords: Cosa Nostra, Yakuza, Triads, Russia Mafia, Mexican Cartel.. What makes organised crime such an interesting subject? Is the illusions of civility behind such barbaric and often cruel acts? Is it the lust of greed? Is it the strong sense of brotherhood? Maybe this idea could be two rival bosses, a kidnapped member of a rival gang, or simply someone getting involved with a guy they really shouldn't have.. Kidnapper and his 'Collection': The standard ""Kidnapper and Victim"" has been a staple of mine for quite a while, and even though I love it, it gets a bit bland. For this one, I was thinking something amongst the lines of a 'Collector' a kidnapper supreme, a serial rapist at large but has yet to be caught. He treats young women simply as things to be 'collected', for the variety, each one he can do different perverted things to.. 'Farm' based: A classic, if I say. Another idea i've done often and is a bit of staple, but one I never stop loving! I looove hucow (shame I don't have the breasts for milking..) pony-play, and general petplay, especially when taken to the *extreme* as this idea suggests. Can be a creepy stalker and his little ranch out in the woods, or maybe it's a 'farm' on a huge, industrial scale? Is it fully illegal, or has a law been passed that allows certain (or all) women to be made into 'pets'? The choice is yours. Bimbo Factory: Bimbos, something a lot of people will admit to hating in public, but also admit to loving in private. Bleached hair (often), blue eyes (again, often), fake tits, fake ass, fake lips, fake fake fake, and stupid as hell. For this idea, I was thinking of a factory, of sorts, where women are turned into bimbos. Much like the previous idea, made it's a law, and women have far less rights. Maybe certain women are taken and are 'sponsored' by wealthy would-be owners, who love to see them transformed against their will. Doctor's Madhouse: Very similar to the Evil Wizard idea, but set in the present, who needs magic when you have **science**! I love the idea of an asylum, one built for those who aren't quite mad.. or mad at all, but soon will be from the horrors that will be inflicted on them. Did someone say full latex bodysuit with gas mask and straight jacket? Yes please Sex Club (from Hell): So i've always liked the idea of a sort of sex club mega-structure, a strip club, fetish club, brothel and swinger's club all mixed into one perhaps, maybe it's in plain sight and is very, very popular, or more likely, it's underground *literally* where the most wealthy and down right perverted are invited to play with the workers.. of which only a few willingly work there. Espionage: Spies! Spooks! G-men! A certain niche that exists mostly in fiction.. or do they? The problem with real life spies is that, more often than not, they *don't* want you to know they're spies. For this idea I was thinking perhaps some seduction, maybe a spy is caught and interrogated, or like wise, maybe a spy is trying to get some information out of a target by any means necessary.. Add to this as you wish. Latex Wonderland: I fucking love Latex. It's probably in my top three fetishes of all time. The smell, the look, the feels, and the heavy objectification that comes with it is all so perfect. Anything revolving around latex purely for a scene instantly get's my attention. Wether it's a latex salesman who imports and exports (Vandelay! Vandelay!) or perhaps a specific club for the rubber lovers. Taking a step further, a world where latex is enforced on certain people.. mmmmm. Something else to add to this, a sort of 'sub-set' of an idea if you will is the idea of ""Rubber Dolls"", heavily fetishised and in constant latex, these 'Dolls' are more treated as such than a human being. Not allowed to orgasm maybe, or speak, or see, or hear, every again in their lives. Maybe an even worse fate awaits them as a living, rubber chair? As you can tell, i'm pretty huge about the latex fetish.. The Stepford Wife Law: What's a stepford wife? Basically a bimbo, but matured, not quite slutty, but still fake looking, almost.. unnerving, in a way. Think the tranquil suburbia of 50's America, but this time, it's not so tranquil. Maybe all women are forced by law to begin having to dress in this fashion, unable to get jobs (unless they're serving men) and forced to become dutiful housewives. I won't lie, I have a bit of a weird fetish of being a wife.. WW3: You know what they say about World War 3, and how World War 4 will be played with sticks and stones. Let's get wild here. Europe and US versus China and Russia! America versus everyone! Rogue states united against 'the free world'! An unloving general and her obsessed second in command, a prisoner of war, hazing, interrogation on soldiers, let me know what you can think of with this one.. Forced into Porn: Kind of a dark one, but after all, don't we just love *convincing* acting? Call it a quasi-snuff, women kidnapped (or men..) and forced to 'preform' on screen, or else a terrible punishment. Of course, to tone it down a bit, it can be blackmail instead. Turns on the blackmail-ee prefers her new job. Slave to the Fame: So this is one of those kind of scenes that sort of break my heart a little. Nothing worse than depressing hentai (fuck it makes me cry) and this idea is a little based of that. So I was thinking something amongst the lines of a pop star, or coming up pop star, who, in a desperate bid to keep her fame, must serve her higher ups so they'll allow her to succeeds. It starts with a blowjob, then sex, then she becomes a private sex slave for the elite of the music industry, all while keeping that smile on stage, her soul breaking inside. Former Athlete, Future Whore: Similar to the one before, i've always had a weird fetish about athletes being taken and forced into sex slaves, toys, breeding cows, yada yada (the irony of a horse rider becoming the pony is *delicious*) I don't know why, maybe it's jealous on my part because I suck at athleticism lol, but think it'd be something worth trying out, be it kidnapping, blackmail, maybe willing. The Manor: I know that you're thinking, it's basically the maid idea, which is right, but *fucked up*. I was thinking a group of wealthy elites (or just the, y'know, one dude or his family) who own a manor way out in the wilds, far from civilisation, fit for the purpose of one thing. Perverted sex. Girls (and guys) are taken all over the world to serve these men (and women!) fulfilling any of their desires. Treated less than human, they are forced into accepting their position as just someone else's fuck toy. BDSM Cruise: Say Doctor, how is this any different than the previous. Well it's not much, but now, it's set on a cruise! (It's the looove boat). For a fun twist, maybe a couple is let on by mistake, thinking it was just an average fun cruise, only to quickly realise their horrors, and constantly led to temptation into giving in to their inner desires. Pervert's Resort: And where better to go after a cruise than to a resort? Okay, the two don't have to be linked, but it's fun ;) Here we would have men on staff to provide intense pleasure to females, tropical women ready to serve any perverted act at any time, special suites for those with a more 'esoteric' taste, cabaret, strip clubs, gambling with high stakes, all under one resort on a beautiful island. The Cruelest Show: A bit of a play on the previous ones about fame. For this strange idea, I was thinking of a tv show, ran on the dark net, for a very high amount of money. Contestants come in and are told the rules. If they last longer than a certain amount of time, they win, and get $1000000! If they lose however, they have to serve as 'helpers' on the show for the rest of their lives. And the purpose of the show? Why, to see who can last the longest in a game of sexual torture and degradation! Think of Battle Royale.. with Rape. Can be set on a large survival based like island too. Contestants have to last a whole week, without 'breaking' or in this case, going insane. Not for the light hearted.. Abducted by ISIS: Yes, yes, I know, pretty dark and taboo, but it's a weird turn on of mine.. Of course, it goes without saying, I don't endorse any action made by said group etc etc. Now, onto the fun bit. Can do a variety of roles for this. Girl kidnapped from country and sent to ISIS controlled lands for specific purpose? (Daughter of a politician, perhaps) Journalist caught in the conflict? A nun 'taught her lesson'? Very interested also not just in the sexy sexy bit but maybe the after part too? Adjusting to life as a Jihadi's wife perhaps? Could be fun! Rent-a-Sweetie: So this one is heavy ageplay based (the legal kind), diapers, DD/lg, pacifier, cribs, etc, a kink i've got into just recently after being put off by it for a while and actually finding it such a turn on! My idea for this scene would be something amongst the line's of an older couple who are unable to have kinds deciding to 'adopt' one of their own, an attractive young female who would make the perfect Daddy's girl. Of course, that's not to say she'd be willing to do it.. I think forced/non-con works better with this scene, but consensual could be done to, maybe a girl who offers her 'services' as a rent-a-baby, or something to that effect? **Alternative History:** These are more kinda story focused than dirty, but i'm sure *we* can make them dirty! Axis/Central Powers Won: Yup, getting even darker here, with the same ""I don't endorse any action"" blah blah blah. But yeah, in this timeline, the Axis won, and World Domination ensues.. (The Man in the High Castle comes to mind) I have to admit, this one is probably even too edgy for me, so I think the Central Powers (WW1) winning might be a more 'tolerant' timeline, perhaps. Roman Empire still exists: Can be any other Empire if you wanted instead, really (like the previous before, or British, etc) but I really like the Roman Empire history so there you go! But for this idea, the Empire never faltered, and exists still today, maybe with even more control of Europe than before (all of it?) 'Scramble for Africa' never existed: In this timeline, Africa was left well enough alone, no colonisation occurred, kingdoms continued and so on and so forth. Did trade and technology advances too happen? Was there, perhaps, a new war on the world set by a united African Empire? Your guess is as good as mine. Eurabia: No, I don't mean that in an right-wing way or anything like that. In this timeline, instead of a distinct line between the Christian Europe and Islamic Arabia, and instead of Muslim conquerers taking only southern Europe (and parts of Eastern) it instead extended to *all* or Europe, from the tip of Scandinavia to the British Isles. Go with how you feel with this one, 'religion-play' as I call it is a interesting taboo I enjoy to play with. Can be set in more modern times, or just after the conquest (so around the Medieval era or so) In Soviet Russia..: So, the Cold War, it can be argued that democracy and capitalism won, that the west won the cultural war and etc etc. But what if it was the opposite? What if the East won, and the majority, if not all the world, was a united people's republic, either under Russia's rule or not. This is one for the workers of the world! ~ **Description:** I usually use a description of myself, but more than happy to play someone else you'd like me to play also. I have a black bob cut with fringe, jet black, and dark brown eyes, perky small breasts (32 B), somewhat pale skin but a little darker (Half Chinese and Half English here), pouty full lips, a roundish head with slight jaw, and high, prominent cheekbones. I stand at 5ft 2, have fairly long legs for my height, with a full figured, round, thick ass (probably my proudest *ass*et lol sorry for the pun), thick thighs, mostly flat stomach, small waist, smooth skin all over, thin arms, petite feet, 112 pounds. (Measurements are 32-26-40), yeah I know i'm a thicc gnome basically) Hope that's enough to go on for you guys, as i'm not much of a kik or pic person, sorry! ~ Note: Yes, I write pretty formally, but don't worry, i'm not cold or calculating, I like to think i'm pretty friendly and fun! You can probably tell from a lot of these prompts is that i'm a bit of a geek. A history geek, a movie geek, a fantasy/sci-fi geek, book geek, huge video game geek also. I try to reply as fast and as often as I can, but uni work, social life and part time jobs tend to catch up with me (as well as um cough gaming.) Hope to hear from you soon, don't resist the urge to give me your own ideas too! Fairly boring ones will be, well, not considered, so try to be a little unique and interesting! Second Note: Even though I love a lot of history, I wouldn't say i'm a buff, although i'm always trying to improve on my knowledge and history also! So please let me know if i've come off as ignorant on any of my ideas, or just generally help to update any info if i've got any of it wrong. Third Note: Sorry for all the constant references i'm such a fucking nerd I can't stop it help me. Fourth Note: LAST ONE NOW if you want to use any ideas here, go ahead! Just *please* let me know first. More than happy to spread them around."
41,cyber crime,dirtypenpals,21 [F4A] Dr Bizzare's Perverted Emporium for the Lustfully Inclined (Huge list of scenarios inside!),4,6bkoog,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6bkoog/21_f4a_dr_bizzares_perverted_emporium_for_the/,2017-05-17 08:21:18,"Hey there! Female with strange username here. I've been around RP's for a while, talking to people, having some great scenes but ultimately, they fall apart. They tend to be too.. normal, too realistic, in some part. After all, without sounding too judgemental, if you can do a scene online, why not in person? I came to the conclusion, that the ideas, scenarios, whatever you want to call them, that I love the most are the ones you just couldn't do in real life. Where fantasy meets eroticism, this interests me most! So, as my name implies, i'm looking for more 'out there' partners, stories that can be long and detailed, or short and intense, female or male, as long as the idea is something more 'unusual', i'm interested. Hence, the username. Let Dr Bizarre (yes i'm aware I spelt my username wrong) take you into her weird little world, a perfect mixture of kinky and imagination (come with me.. and you'll see..) Bit about me. I'm 21 years old, from the U.K., but that's all not THAT important (unless you like cuckolding..) generally speaking, within reason, I love playing a wide range of ages (legal of course), and etc etc. I'm kinky as Sodom and Gomorra, but not totally turned off at romanticism! (Vanilla though? Blegh..) I looove darker scenes, but light-hearted ones can be a joy also. In terms of writing style, I tend to adapt who I talk to. The more 'storied' the scenario the more I write. I'm not going to write 5 paragraphs about how the curtains were a curious shade of crimson as a penis pumps into me, likewise though, i'm not going to write a simple one sentence reply, or at least try not to, I try to maintain somewhere between these two. INCOMING LIST OF KINKS (I really need to do a kink list..): BDSM, bondage, latex, humiliation, degradation, piss/scat, petplay, non-con/dubcon sex work, ageplay (the legal kind, DDlg, diapers, pacifiers, etc), anal, rimming, face sitting, lingerie, high heels, leather, body worship, gang bangs/group sex, femdom (gentle and heavy), public, feet, bimbo/bimbofication, stepfordication, misogny/misandry, interracial, raceplay, force feeding, body mod, lactation, tattoos, piercings, branding, cheating/cuckolding, breeding, incest, unrealistic body sizes, inflation (note huge), cukcold, breeding/impregnation, lactation, piercings, brandings, tattoos, cumplay, forced orgasm/orgasm denial, and so on. My limits are gore, vomiting, vore, messy play, necrophilia and blood. I'm sure i've missed out some kinks, please let me know yours so I can add some to my future list! So, without further ado, here's my ideas. I'm going to put them in categories because there's so many right now, and will probably be more in the future. As said early, i'm looking for something a bit more 'unusual' and story based too. I'm not a fan of 'normal' RPs (offices, mom and neighbour's son, teacher and student.. done them to death, to be honest) nor am I fan of scenarios based on existing fiction, which i'm never that much to grips with (although I don't mind stuff *influenced* by said things, as you'll find I have in my ideas below) Some of these ideas can fit into more than one category, and please, if you want to mix any of them up, let me know. **Fantasy/Medieval** Fantasy World: Generic as FUCK but we love it. Sort of basing more on World of Warcraft world/LotR sort of thing, bit of D&amp;D why not, but sort of something on it's own too, let's world build together! No specific ideas for this in mind, this is a very open ended scenario. Orcs on elf girl? Sure? Humans on orc girls? Why not? A war? Forbidden romance? Nymphs? Dwarves? (hint: I ain't playing a fucking female dwarf) Demons? Angels? Centaurs? Goblins? Trolls? Orges? (GET OUT OF MY SWAMP) Satyrs? Let's go crazy with this one. Prince/Princess: A bit of a standard one, but who doesn't want to be a princess/prince every now and then? This is one I could see easily working either roles (Me Princess or serving a prince), and many ideas spring from this. Prince/princess buys a slave, or they get kidnapped by state enemies, or they willingly fall into a secret fetish cult, etc etc! Hell: Yes, actual hell! Demons, perhaps Monsters of some kind! The idea of someone being in hell *when they shouldn't be* is even more fun, although for those with a heart of gold, doing something sadistic to someone who perhaps deserves it may relieve some stress off of your mind! Fallen Angel: A take on the prior idea, perhaps? An angel who has been casted out of Heaven (or similar in likeness). Perhaps they had left willingly, after their own naivety. Despite there powers, they may find the physical plane more difficult than thought. Rule of the 'Beastmen': So i'll get this of my chest. I'm not much of a furry person, although I don't judge others for liking them. Especially stuff like the fur suits. But, Beastmen? On a human? That's kind of fucking hot.. This idea panders more the idea of maybe kidnapped human, or a kingdom under siege by beastmen, etc etc. For those of you who don't know, Beastmen are basically furries lol but TOUGH and MEAN and SCARY and shit. Vampires, and Werewolves, and Vampires!: Doesn't have to be the two together, just saves me some extra text lmao. So yeah, vampires, sort of a common staple in teenage fan-fiction (fuck twilight), not the biggest turn on of mine, but something i'd try out! I've always liked the more traditional, evil-but-charismatic sort of vampires (Bram Stoker, Ann Rice, Folk Lore, Vampire: The Masquerade, even Legacy of Kain) rather than the sparkled up pretty guys. The idea of being kept as a vampire's feeding slave is pretty hot won't lie. Werewolves a sort of similar thing, verging on furries at times but not really? Brutal, savage, pretty hot if also totally fucking dangerous. Sure we can think of a few ideas with both of these. Set in the past, set in modern era, etc etc. Amazonian Tribe: Didn't know wether to put this as historical or fantasy but the Amazonian are *mythical* and not real, so.. But yeah, who doesn't love giant, curvy powerful women who could not the living shit out of any man? Does anyone else sense a sort of femdom idea here, or is that just me? Maybe a lost explorer is taken by the tribe to be a loving husband for a wife.. sounds fun. Cult of Zod: Occultism, Satanism, sounds like a jolly good time to summon some demons and/or procure some dark magic! Okay real talk I love occultism in real life so this is a cool one with me. Also who doesn't find the whole sex cult look such a turn on? Robes, piercing, esoteric tattoo, demons, I did say it was 'out there'. Evil Wizard: Hiding in their tower, the evil Wizard plots cruel, magical plans for the poor victims of the hamlet/city/castle below. Maybe they plan on transforming their victim? Or setting their new 'pet' on them? Think Mad Scientist, but with *m a g i c* The Witches Coven: Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn, and caldron bubble! A secret gathering in the woods, an underground movement, maybe even a secret elite amongst the female nobles of said world, this one's all about witches. Could be they are find out and sent to the 'interrogator' but I was thinking more about the Witches/Witch getting their way.. bit more of a femdom one this, gentle or hard. The Bluebeard Baron: Not a nice guy, Bluebeard. A rich noble in a french folk legend, he would continuously marry young girls, and they would somehow go missing.. only to be found under the cellar of his castle. A pretty dark story, but this one is a little.. uh, lighter. I mean, they'll be no murder, but the idea of a rich, cruel (maybe magically inclined) Baron having his pick of girls for his own purposes? Sounds delightfully dark. **Sci-Fi:** It came from Outer Space!: Ooooh, aliiiieeens! I've always been a firm believer in aliens (I WANT TO BELIEVE) and this and that, although I admit, from a sexual point of view, i'm more fond on the more *humanoid* aliens rather than Za-glob, the mass tentacles of blobs from Planet 718 and that sort of thing. Maybe a UFO crash (thinking Roswell sort of thing here, 50's America), or human abducted for a space zoo, or perhaps for a pet, that sort of thing. Space Pirates: Man, who doesn't love space pirates. They're pirates.. In space! That's so fucking cool. Can do either roles for this one, either Space Pirate and their hostages, a sort of space cops n' robbers scenario, maybe some romance between the captain and a crew member, it's the love boat but *set in space!* City XOX: G e n e r i c s c i - f i n a m e but in all seriousness I quite like the idea of the Shadowrun, Neuromancer cyber-punk world, it's an interesting niche within it's own. Sci-fi *and* dystopias? Sign me the fuck up. Can do a lot with this one, more based on setting than ideas, really. I think this one would go well mixed with a few other ideas or kinks listed already, so go crazy. Fall of the Super-heroine/Superhero: So, i'm not a big Marvel kind of girl, or DC, in fact, except from a few comics, i'm not a big comic person really (batman is cool though). But I love the idea of a fallen superhero, one who was the pride of the city, or nation, only to be trapped by her arch nemesis and degraded each day by him. Can do this vice versa of course, must be so fun being a supervillian, muhahahah. Can be a fallen supervillian as well! For those who prefer their punishment to be a bit more on the 'justice' side than 'perverted'. Post-Apocalyptic: Straight out of a Fallout of this. A world ravaged, many years passed, etc etc, blah blah. This one can be pretty dark, i'd imagine, with no law, and every man for himself in the ruthless, barren wasteland. Of course, it could be more consensual, could be there's more law and the world's not so fucked up, but let's go with what you like. A vaults? Seems pretty fun to me also. Slut in the Shell: Not too subtle of a reference there. Sexbots, Androids, Gynoids, Cyborgs, let's go really tech-y with this one. A world where anyone can have any body they desire, but it is *really* there body? It may feel like skin, but if it doesn't bleed, is it human? And then there's the risks of being hacked.. or the people people who are forced into their new robotics bodies. Of course, instead of cyborgs, we can do Androids, built for many purposes, but can they be human? Getting **deep** here, duuuude. **Historical/Geographical:** 'Exotica' (Orient, Middle East, Africa, South America etc): Kind of a basic one? I don't know where I was going with this.. But I was thinking tourist maybe, maybe a diplomatic delegate, a holiday resort, that sort of thing. A little bit on the vanilla side, but i'm sure we can spruce it up a bit. Western World: HOWDY Y'ALL now i've never been hugely into cowboys and what not, although it's a pretty interesting history, and I think we can do a few things with this. Outlaw on the run, the little whore house, a vicious gang versus a lawmaker, that sort of thing. Doesn't have to be set in the past either, if we want to get a bit sci-fi with it we can always go for that sort of Borderland/Firefly vibe A Gentleman's Maid: Victorian era, probably one of the most aesthetically stunning and important eras yet so god damn shitty for so many people. Still, it did bring us something we all love and know. Maids! Who doesn't love a traditional Victorian or French maid with their sexy outfits, demure manners (or not so demure..) and willingness to serve *any way they can*? Can be on the light hearted side this one, or way dark. Forced into the Tribe: So this one is a bit similar to the amazonian tribe idea, and the exotic idea, except the shoe will be on the other foot now. Be it a wandering tourist off the beaten path, or an intrepid explorer, in the past or modern era, either sounds good. The idea of being the chief's wife is such a turn on, although the tribe's fucktoy doesn't sound bad either.. Antiquity (Roman Empire, Greece, Persia): THE BEST ERA YOU CAN'T DENY IT I love the Roman Empire so much, it's so interesting to me, i've always been a big fan even as a kid. And now, as a perverted adult, I can appreciate just how perverted these guys were. Orgies, Sex gods (Greece), slaves, excess wine, what's not to love? The Harem: Thinking more of a Middle-Eastern/Turkish/North African idea with this one, the Prince or wealthy merchant and his large harem, lots of fun, quite literally in this case. Of course, can be reverted, a princess and her harem, perhaps? Rare, and pretty much never happened in history (as far as i'm aware, except with Catherine the Great probably) but could be fun! The Crusades: Ahhh, controversial scenario time. The Crusades are and were pretty bloody, pretty horrific on both sides, but pretty interesting also (considering how many there were). Still, could be fun idea for a scene. You a crusader, me a wife of your slain enemy, or me an innocent nun, you one of Saladin's men.. you get the idea here. Dark, but doesn't have to be really. Horsemen: Also known as the Mongols, the Scythian, pre-ottoman Turks, the Huns, a generally wide group of people often attributed as 'Horsemen' through out history. A migrating tribe and empire, could be you have just sieged my city, looking for new plunder, or perhaps vice versa. For this perverted, Pony play comes to mind.. Pirates: Do what you want cause a pirate is free! I've loved Pirates since I was a child, such an interesting period in a time where ideas such as Liberty and Free Will were being chucked around, only to be endorsed by absolute, but loveable, scoundrels. A neat mix of cultures too. Chinese pirates? Pirates off the coast of America? The Caribbean? Barbary? Can do a lot here! Viking's Whore: So how are Vikings *not* pirates again? But anyway, for those of you who want to play the thor-worshipping, europa-pillaging, mead-drinking beasts of Northern Europe, this would be a good chance! I was thinking a recent victim of a viking pillage, who was thought to make a better slave or wife than held for ransom, would be interesting. **Modern/Just plain Dark:** Organised Crime Lords: Cosa Nostra, Yakuza, Triads, Russia Mafia, Mexican Cartel.. What makes organised crime such an interesting subject? Is the illusions of civility behind such barbaric and often cruel acts? Is it the lust of greed? Is it the strong sense of brotherhood? Maybe this idea could be two rival bosses, a kidnapped member of a rival gang, or simply someone getting involved with a guy they really shouldn't have.. Kidnapper and his 'Collection': The standard ""Kidnapper and Victim"" has been a staple of mine for quite a while, and even though I love it, it gets a bit bland. For this one, I was thinking something amongst the lines of a 'Collector' a kidnapper supreme, a serial rapist at large but has yet to be caught. He treats young women simply as things to be 'collected', for the variety, each one he can do different perverted things to.. 'Farm' based: A classic, if I say. Another idea i've done often and is a bit of staple, but one I never stop loving! I looove hucow (shame I don't have the breasts for milking..) pony-play, and general petplay, especially when taken to the *extreme* as this idea suggests. Can be a creepy stalker and his little ranch out in the woods, or maybe it's a 'farm' on a huge, industrial scale? Is it fully illegal, or has a law been passed that allows certain (or all) women to be made into 'pets'? The choice is yours. Bimbo Factory: Bimbos, something a lot of people will admit to hating in public, but also admit to loving in private. Bleached hair (often), blue eyes (again, often), fake tits, fake ass, fake lips, fake fake fake, and stupid as hell. For this idea, I was thinking of a factory, of sorts, where women are turned into bimbos. Much like the previous idea, made it's a law, and women have far less rights. Maybe certain women are taken and are 'sponsored' by wealthy would-be owners, who love to see them transformed against their will. Doctor's Madhouse: Very similar to the Evil Wizard idea, but set in the present, who needs magic when you have **science**! I love the idea of an asylum, one built for those who aren't quite mad.. or mad at all, but soon will be from the horrors that will be inflicted on them. Did someone say full latex bodysuit with gas mask and straight jacket? Yes please Sex Club (from Hell): So i've always liked the idea of a sort of sex club mega-structure, a strip club, fetish club, brothel and swinger's club all mixed into one perhaps, maybe it's in plain sight and is very, very popular, or more likely, it's underground *literally* where the most wealthy and down right perverted are invited to play with the workers.. of which only a few willingly work there. Espionage: Spies! Spooks! G-men! A certain niche that exists mostly in fiction.. or do they? The problem with real life spies is that, more often than not, they *don't* want you to know they're spies. For this idea I was thinking perhaps some seduction, maybe a spy is caught and interrogated, or like wise, maybe a spy is trying to get some information out of a target by any means necessary.. Add to this as you wish. Latex Wonderland: I fucking love Latex. It's probably in my top three fetishes of all time. The smell, the look, the feels, and the heavy objectification that comes with it is all so perfect. Anything revolving around latex purely for a scene instantly get's my attention. Wether it's a latex salesman who imports and exports (Vandelay! Vandelay!) or perhaps a specific club for the rubber lovers. Taking a step further, a world where latex is enforced on certain people.. mmmmm. The Stepford Wife Law: What's a stepford wife? Basically a bimbo, but matured, not quite slutty, but still fake looking, almost.. unnerving, in a way. Think the tranquil suburbia of 50's America, but this time, it's not so tranquil. Maybe all women are forced by law to begin having to dress in this fashion, unable to get jobs (unless they're serving men) and forced to become dutiful housewives. I won't lie, I have a bit of a weird fetish of being a wife.. WW3: You know what they say about World War 3, and how World War 4 will be played with sticks and stones. Let's get wild here. Europe and US versus China and Russia! America versus everyone! Rogue states united against 'the free world'! An unloving general and her obsessed second in command, a prisoner of war, hazing, interrogation on soldiers, let me know what you can think of with this one.. Forced into Porn: Kind of a dark one, but after all, don't we just love *convincing* acting? Call it a quasi-snuff, women kidnapped (or men..) and forced to 'preform' on screen, or else a terrible punishment. Of course, to tone it down a bit, it can be blackmail instead. Turns on the blackmail-ee prefers her new job. Slave to the Fame: So this is one of those kind of scenes that sort of break my heart a little. Nothing worse than depressing hentai (fuck it makes me cry) and this idea is a little based of that. So I was thinking something amongst the lines of a pop star, or coming up pop star, who, in a desperate bid to keep her fame, must serve her higher ups so they'll allow her to succeeds. It starts with a blowjob, then sex, then she becomes a private sex slave for the elite of the music industry, all while keeping that smile on stage, her soul breaking inside. Former Athlete, Future Whore: Similar to the one before, i've always had a weird fetish about athletes being taken and forced into sex slaves, toys, breeding cows, yada yada (the irony of a horse rider becoming the pony is *delicious*) I don't know why, maybe it's jealous on my part because I suck at athleticism lol, but think it'd be something worth trying out, be it kidnapping, blackmail, maybe willing. The Manor: I know that you're thinking, it's basically the maid idea, which is right, but *fucked up*. I was thinking a group of wealthy elites (or just the, y'know, one dude or his family) who own a manor way out in the wilds, far from civilisation, fit for the purpose of one thing. Perverted sex. Girls (and guys) are taken all over the world to serve these men (and women!) fulfilling any of their desires. Treated less than human, they are forced into accepting their position as just someone else's fuck toy. BDSM Cruise: Say Doctor, how is this any different than the previous. Well it's not much, but now, it's set on a cruise! (It's the looove boat). For a fun twist, maybe a couple is let on by mistake, thinking it was just an average fun cruise, only to quickly realise their horrors, and constantly led to temptation into giving in to their inner desires. The Cruelest Show: A bit of a play on the previous ones about fame. For this strange idea, I was thinking of a tv show, ran on the dark net, for a very high amount of money. Contestants come in and are told the rules. If they last longer than a certain amount of time, they win, and get $1000000! If they lose however, they have to serve as 'helpers' on the show for the rest of their lives. And the purpose of the show? Why, to see who can last the longest in a game of sexual torture and degradation! Think of Battle Royale.. with Rape. Can be set on a large survival based like island too. Contestants have to last a whole week, without 'breaking' or in this case, going insane. Not for the light hearted.. Abducted by ISIS: Yes, yes, I know, pretty dark and taboo, but it's a weird turn on of mine.. Of course, it goes without saying, I don't endorse any action made by said group etc etc. Now, onto the fun bit. Can do a variety of roles for this. Girl kidnapped from country and sent to ISIS controlled lands for specific purpose? (Daughter of a politician, perhaps) Journalist caught in the conflict? A nun 'taught her lesson'? Very interested also not just in the sexy sexy bit but maybe the after part too? Adjusting to life as a Jihadi's wife perhaps? Could be fun! **Alternative History:** These are more kinda story focused than dirty, but i'm sure *we* can make them dirty! Axis/Central Powers Won: Yup, getting even darker here, with the same ""I don't endorse any action"" blah blah blah. But yeah, in this timeline, the Axis won, and World Domination ensues.. (The Man in the High Castle comes to mind) I have to admit, this one is probably even too edgy for me, so I think the Central Powers (WW1) winning might be a more 'tolerant' timeline, perhaps. Roman Empire still exists: Can be any other Empire if you wanted instead, really (like the previous before, or British, etc) but I really like the Roman Empire history so there you go! But for this idea, the Empire never faltered, and exists still today, maybe with even more control of Europe than before (all of it?) 'Scramble for Africa' never existed: In this timeline, Africa was left well enough alone, no colonisation occurred, kingdoms continued and so on and so forth. Did trade and technology advances too happen? Was there, perhaps, a new war on the world set by a united African Empire? Your guess is as good as mine. Eurabia: No, I don't mean that in an right-wing way or anything like that. In this timeline, instead of a distinct line between the Christian Europe and Islamic Arabia, and instead of Muslim conquerers taking only southern Europe (and parts of Eastern) it instead extended to *all* or Europe, from the tip of Scandinavia to the British Isles. Go with how you feel with this one, 'religion-play' as I call it is a interesting taboo I enjoy to play with. Can be set in more modern times, or just after the conquest (so around the Medieval era or so) ~ I usually use a description of myself, but more than happy to play someone else you'd like me to play also. I have a black bob cut with fringe, jet black, and dark brown eyes, perky small breasts (32 B), somewhat pale skin but a little darker (Half Chinese and Half English here), pouty full lips, a roundish head with slight jaw, and high, prominent cheekbones. I stand at 5ft 2, have fairly long legs for my height, with a full figured, round, thick ass (probably my proudest *ass*et lol sorry for the pun), thick thighs, mostly flat stomach, small waist, smooth skin all over, thin arms, petite feet, 112 pounds. (Measurements are 32-26-40, yeah I know i'm a thicc gnome basically) Hope that's enough to go on for you guys, as i'm not much of a kik or pic person, sorry! ~ Note: Yes, I write pretty formally, but don't worry, i'm not cold or calculating, I like to think i'm pretty friendly and fun! You can probably tell from a lot of these prompts is that i'm a bit of a geek. A history geek, a movie geek, a fantasy/sci-fi geek, book geek, huge video game geek also. I try to reply as fast and as often as I can, but uni work, social life and part time jobs tend to catch up with me (as well as um cough gaming.) Hope to hear from you soon, don't resist the urge to give me your own ideas too! Fairly boring ones will be, well, not considered, so try to be a little unique and interesting! Second Note: Even though I love a lot of history, I wouldn't say i'm a buff, although i'm always trying to improve on my knowledge and history also! (next prompts coming, the Aztecs, the Chinese Empire, WW2, Samurais and Ninjas!.. Alternative Histories also?) so please let me know if i've come off as ignorant on any of my ideas, or just generally help to update any info if i've got any of it wrong. Third Note: Sorry for all the constant references i'm such a fucking nerd I can't stop it help me. Fourth Note: LAST ONE NOW if you want to use any ideas here, go ahead! Just *please* let me know first. More than happy to spread them around."
