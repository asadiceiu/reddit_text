I'm a mid 20s guy who first dropped acid two months ago, and I had previously tried cannabis. Cannabis was a very negative experience for me because of how I'm wired. I accidentally ate it at a party and spent the rest of the night crying and huddling in a corner thinking the world was ending. It put me off trying drugs for a while. I first was offered the opportunity to try acid by a friend of mine. I accepted and he gave me three hits of blotter. I took them and felt the effects about 30-45 mins into taking them (they tested positive for LSD, so I know I didn't take RCs or nbomes). The first trip was intense as fuck. I saw the walls warp and bend, the clouds outside swirling and making all sorts of shapes, and the cramps. Oh the cramps. My arms, legs and face all cramped super hard, reminded me of trismus after I had my wisdom teeth yanked. Once I hit the peak I got used to the effects of the drug and began to relax. Then it happened. I blacked out and my memories began flooding into my mind. I had an intense period of self reflection in which ended in me experiencing an episode of losing track of who I was, what I was doing and such. I do not know if this is ego death, but it sure felt like I was forced to face my own shortcomings. I snapped back to reality and my friend looked at me concerned. I insisted I was fine, and for the next few hours I began to enjoy the ride again until the comedown began. I had intense nausea and cramps so I took a single etizolam, and managed to get some fruit down. Seriously I don't recommend eating crackers or anything that will form crumbs in your mouth. After that trip I noticed serious positive effects on my psyche. I felt less inclined to judge people for their faults. I also felt less egotistical, and I notice I don't feel depressed as often. I consider that a huge improvement. I dropped a single hit (100 mcg) on NYE to see how one hit affects me. Much to my surprise I found the trip much more manageable, less intense and I was able to sit down and ask myself more hard questions about my life. I spent a good hour seeing Mayan glyphs in my carpet, went for a walk and marveled at how I was able to see so much beauty in something as mundane as a Japanese maple tree. Came back inside and sat down listening to the Symphony of the Night soundtrack, especially enjoying the effects it had on my CVEs. Noticed that the nausea was much less intense and that the trip made seltzer water taste amazing. Changed rooms and went into my living room which has cherry blossom wallpaper and I sat and watched as the cherry blossoms bloomed, withered and died just to start all over again. Drank an insane amount of seltzer to keep me hydrated, ate some persimmons which tasted interesting, slightly metallic yet pleasantly sweet. Came down around 4AM, slept until 8 and got up feeling like a million bucks. Absolutely recommend LSD to anyone facing depression."
