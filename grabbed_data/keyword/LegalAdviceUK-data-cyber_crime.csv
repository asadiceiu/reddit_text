0,cyber crime,LegalAdviceUK,An individual is actively trying to ruin a very serious legal case that is currently being investigated by police.,1,hh57z5,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/hh57z5/an_individual_is_actively_trying_to_ruin_a_very/,2020-06-28 10:46:17,"Hi everyone. I am currently involved in a police investigation which is based around allegations of sexual abuse and harrasment. There are over 20 people involved who are all making statements about one individual who committed the offenses. A man on facebook decided to involve himself into the case and try to help 'expose' the criminal. We all warned him not to get involved as it may jeopardise the case. Some things were said in a group chat about him possibly ruining our chances of taking this man down as he was publicly posting things and planning to go to the police himself on behalf of people when we told him not to. Somebody in the chat sent him the messages and he is now reporting us all for cyber bullying. He said openly on messages that he is hoping to ruin the case for us and other things along those lines. If he does report us for cyber bullying could it affect our original case? We didn't harass, threaten or target him. We simply told him his involvement could ruin our case and asked him to stop getting involved as it had nothing to do with him. We are all terrified as the crime we reported is extremely serious and we can't have anything ruining the case at all."
1,cyber crime,LegalAdviceUK,"U.K.: looking for recommendations of a solicitor specialising in things like revenge porn (we arent the victims but have been accused of creating revenge porn of my partners ex), stalking, harassment, basically jealous ex partners. Urgent.",1,hinill,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/hinill/uk_looking_for_recommendations_of_a_solicitor/,2020-06-30 23:38:36,"ENGLAND My partners ex (he hasnt seen her for over 6 years but shes been trying to ruin his life since he broke up with her) has accused him of all sorts - all lies. Its frightening. Its ruining our life. This isnt the first time she has done this - he was NFAd years ago due to no evidence. We are now being accused of setting up social media accounts from our home, using intimate photos of her (which we apparently stole from her boyfriends computer) as the display picture, and sending her threatening messages from these accounts. The police showed us screenshots showing 3 images and 2 messages, but thats the only evidence we have ever been shown. We havent been shown any proof it came from our IP, just their word. It was 11 months ago we were arrested. As of last week, shes now accused my partner of theft too. It never ends- I am so depressed and I know its going to make him ill too if this goes much further. We want a family together but I am too scared to get pregnant in case she finds out somehow and gets triggered again and does something even worse to us. Its very sad. I have never met or spoken to this girl but she sent me horrifically cruel Facebook messages in the past (6 years ago) which I never answered, and just blocked her. The last time my partner spoke to her was then, to tell her to please leave me alone. Looking for a solicitor specialising in things like cyber crime/hacking/revenge porn/stalking (I reckon shes been keeping tabs on us for years from afar). He doesnt have any social media but I for one am sick and tired of feeling scared of posting ANYTHING online for fear of triggering her and her making more false allegations purely because shes jealous. We assume this is what this is all down to. I am close to erasing myself from the internet completely but still think this wouldnt help anything at this stage. Im reluctant for him to use a solicitor not specialising in anything like this so recommendations are most welcome - thanks in advance."

When the DBS check is processing? Or right at the end when I sign the contract that will most likely say I need to make them aware of active investigations and previous convictions (I have none)?

He's got a long history with saying the wrong thing and being attacked for it on there. It has verged on cyber bullying in the past (apparently he got called a pedophile for writing baby fetish fan fiction a few years back) and as a result he took time away from interacting with fellow fans and people on that site. We all thought he'd grown out of it, but I've just seen his story on Instagram where he's boasting about how he's rejoined the site and is back to his old tricks. Posting things that he knows will likely inflame situations and encourage folks to come at him hard again. He knows what he's doing, but he's called out his former ""bullies"" in this Instagram video today and told them that he believes if anyone was to attack him in a post online now, that he'd have the upper hand because he's autistic (not diagnosed) and it would be a hate crime and the ""internet police"" would get involved. He is utterly convinced that he could have people from other countries arrested by ""the internet police"" and that he'd be able to take them to court, thus ruining their lives and him gaining compensation and stuff etc. I have no idea where he's got this idea from. He really does seem to think that there's some kind of law out there that's given him a free pass to go around saying whatever the hell he likes online and provoking trouble for himself and upsetting other people, because he believes he's got somewhere to run to now (from a legal standpoint) if the heat gets too hot as it did in the past. I think he's an idiot and he's asking for trouble or likely to get doxxed, so I'd like to be able to tell him exactly WHY he's an idiot for thinking he's safe to go around annoying people online and acting like a general tool. He's clever because he's not clearly trolling people (obviously so he can play the victim at some point in the future if need be) but he knows what will inflame situations and provoke reactions and is encouraging it cleverly. Would he really have a leg to stand on if some fan of the video games/tv show he likes came after him and started calling him names and saying nasty things about him again? Would it matter that he'd been provoking people for reaction and actively returned to a website he had a history with just to stir stuff up again? He needs to grow the hell up and honestly, and I would really like to be able to tell him what the law actually is and what power he actually has to challenge anyone he feels has attacked him, because I think he's got a majorly over inflated idea of what the police would actually do, or what he could challenge in court, should he end up being dragged through the mud as a result of his own actions online. Any help/advice would be useful, thanks!"

Were in England. My brother is 11 and he was playing up yesterday so I decided to block all his games on the computer and on the Xbox yesterday. This morning he asked if Id logged into his email, he was informed by yahoo that there was suspicious activity from North Weald/Epping Forrest, England. Couldnt have been me because were both living in London and I said I dont hack into anyones account. A few minutes later, he asked if I could unblock this game Unturned and he kept saying hed get into trouble. I got him to explain further and basically hes been talking to this person via the in-game text and this person was telling him all about how theyd been in prison and hacked computers, was threatening my brother and basically told him to log into the game daily or else. I dont know if this person is actually dangerous or is just saying this stuff but what hes been saying sounds frightening and manipulative to me and my brother is scared. Also it reminded me of Breck Bednar, this 14 year old boy who was murdered by someone he met whilst online gaming. I asked my brother a bunch of questions and he said hed not told the person his name, where he lived or anything. The only thing the person knows is his username thing. Ive explained to him that this person was likely lying about being in prison and all that because he was trying to manipulate him. This person is not who they say they are and theyre a predator. He said he never told them his age but I cant imagine he is also 11, as my brother is. It seems like an older teenager or an adult who is preying on a child. I think this person is from North Weald/Epping Forrest or they used a VPN to try and access my brothers email account because he has not been online on Unturned. So Ive been going through his emails and deactivating or deleting anything linked to his email or his username so this person cannot contact him again. And then I will delete his email and set up a child one linked to my gmail account, one that I can also access. Hes got one really good friend hes had for 3 years who hes spoken to over Discord and Roblox before this. I assumed because my brother was using his mic that this other person was also but hes just told me the other person just responded using text. Ive been away at uni for most of these past 3 years but Ive not seen or heard him act in a strange way with him. They seem quite close and hes there talking and laughing a lot with him. I just asked him if this person he speaks to is anything like the guy from Unturned but he says no and he really doesnt want me to delete his discord because of this friend of his. I dont think this person is bad, but Im still a bit wary. I think I might set up a new discord for him and then have him send his I feel like an absolute clown. Im partly to blame for this because I think I couldve done more to prevent something like this or paid more attention to him online. I have parental controls on the Xbox, he could not talk to anyone not on his friend list up until a few weeks ago when I bought him Overwatch. Hes not had any problems so far on Overwatch. I also have parental controls on the computer and I can monitor what he searches on chrome but I cant monitor the things he does on the applications on the computer so I cant see anything on his PC games. Its not enough, does anyone know anymore I can do? I dont think this is something I can take to the police. I learnt a bit about cyber crime at uni and it is very difficult to police because of the online scope of it. And he says there is no evidence of the chats on the game."

Sister is with an abusive boyfriend who has hinted that he has her house bugged (no visible evidence but he definitely knows about conversations she has when hes not around). He also has access to every social media account, can see her phone screen remotely and always seems to know her location. They dont live together, but he has complete control over every life decision, who shes friends with and what conversations she has with people because shes scared hell hear. Hes never physical (as far as were aware) and Ive never seen marks. The abuse is emotional and having a profound effect on her life and well-being. Multiple family members have tried conversations with absolutely no phones or access to anything he could listen to, she claims to love him so at times weve had to leave her to it. BUT, recently shes hinted about him having something on her so I believe she is being blackmailed to stay with him. Is there anything I can do to alert the police with no real evidence?

I will give some background on what happened, please don't say how silly she was to fall for the scam, we are both aware of this. I think if I was with her at the time I would have realised something was up, and to be honest I think in most cases she would have too, but it just came at the perfect time and slipped past her for a second until it was too late. She is really sad and embarrassed about it. Basically, we moved into a new house 4 days ago (our first mortgage) and she had one of those fancy beds with the TV at the bottom in her old house. It was too heavy to take with us so she put it on Gumtree for 400. Someone offered to buy it but said they would pay 700 via paypal so that she could pay 300 to a courier. That seems suspect straight away because why couldn't they just pay the courier themselves, but like I said she was in a rush to get rid of the bed, and excited about the prospect of the Christmas presents she could buy people with the extra money, and all this happened over a few minutes so it just didn't even enter her head to be suspicious. So then she gets an email from ""paypal"" saying that she's received 700 and it has a note from the sender reminding her to pay the courier (and some bank details). So she transfers the 300 to the account given, then obviously realises there is no money in her paypal and the email was fake. Called the bank, they said they'd look into it and update us, but basically said if the person removed the funds from their account straight away, there's nothing they could do as it can't be traced to whatever account they sent it to next (which is dumb in itself, all digital money is traceable and most ATMs are seen by a CCTV camera). It's been 24 hours since we called the bank and I assume if the money was in the account they would have called back by now so it looks like the bank can't help at all. Contacted Fraud UK next who are supposed to investigate these things, but they haven't called back either. I know it could have been avoided with a little more caution but my girlfriend is a really hard working mental health nurse and just a generally incredible person, and she was SO happy when she thought she'd sold that bed, just to buy some better Christmas presents for people since we're both broke after moving. The idea of someone doing this to her makes me rage out so bad. She's just plain sad and embarrassed. What finally seemed to put the nail in the coffin of hope was, I googled the email address of the person that scammed her and he/she's been doing this to people successfully since 2009, including on websites intended for selling useful equipment and aids to disabled people. If they have done it on the same email address for that long, I assume it's because they have absolutely zero fear of reprisal. I wonder if anyone knows of any further steps we can take outside the bank and Fraud UK? Are there international groups/police hotlines to investigate this sort of thing? We have emails and everything to prove it, as well as the details of the bank the money they went to, so it surely shouldn't be hard for the police to find who the person is? That seems wishful thinking based on how long this scammer seems to have been operating, but I mean, it wouldn't be hard for the police to find somebody if they had proof they had stolen something and the only information they had on that person was there bank account details right? And we have those details and that proof so...."

22,cyber crime,LegalAdviceUK,"My eBay account was hacked in 2010 - I now owe eBay 23,494.87 and increasing each week",14,38ej4m,http://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/38ej4m/my_ebay_account_was_hacked_in_2010_i_now_owe_ebay/,2015-06-04 04:12:44,"I had a business on eBay selling refurbished antique furniture back in 2003, my business did really well and would often average around 15,000 in sales each month. In 2007 I stopped selling on eBay due to health issues and the spiralling eBay seller fees. In late November of 2010 I got a letter from iQor debt collection agency demanding I pay 19,003.01 to them as they were acting on behalf of ""eBay Market Place"". Wondering how I owed this sort of money I tried to log into my eBay account however the password had been changed. Since I had created the eBay account using a business domain that expired I had no way of recovering the account so I contacted eBay to tell them that I feared my account had been compromised and eBay say they would lock the account until they establish the real owner. I gave my email address and phone number and some personal details so they could contact me with the results of the investigation. I was also told to ignore the debt collection letters for now. January of 2011 I get an email from eBay saying they found I was the real owner and gave me a link to reset my password. After resetting my password and logging back into the eBay account I found that somebody had been selling items and not posting them resulting in my eBay account being charged with the reversal fees. The money was going into a PayPal account these hackers were using so I was wondering why I am liable for the money since it was going into somebody else's PayPal account? I contacted eBay again to ask why I was still getting letters from iQor and was told it's because I still owe the money! It doesn't matter my account was hacked and the money was going to someone in France, I had to pay up or get taken to court! I contacted the police and reported that my account had been hacked shortly after that conversation with eBay. The police officer took down my details and passed it on to a cyber crime unit down in London. I gave iQor the crime reference number I was given by the police. iQor said they would pass the case back to eBay since they couldn't do much with it as it was a ""disputed debt"". May of 2011 and I get a letter from iQor again for the first time in a few months saying that eBay has given them the case back and now they have sufficient evidence I am the account holder I will have to pay the money owed. At this time the police were still investigating so I ignored any correspondence from iQor. In December of 2011 the police send me a letter explaining that they are closing the case as unresolved as eBay/PayPal would not assist them in their investigations. Fast forward to today and I owe eBay exactly 23,494.87. iQor are now known as Akinika and they still continue to send me letters and bailiffs to my door. I want this to stop but I'm told it's a valid debt and have to pay it. I've had threats by 11 different legal firms to take me to court to recover the debt also. I don't know what to do any more and despite reporting this to the police eBay say it's my account and I am responsible for the security - not them and I must pay them the outstanding balance. Does anyone know what I can do? "
