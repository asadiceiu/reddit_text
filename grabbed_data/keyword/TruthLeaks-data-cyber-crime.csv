Henry Kissinger Thinks We All Should Live Together In a Big Gymnasium Instead of Houses In Neighborhoods",5,9c4y2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/TruthLeaks/comments/9c4y2f/the_world_will_be_lonlier_without_john_mccainum/,2018-09-02 03:37:43,"The Military Industrial Complexes own great uncle and belligerent, hawkish cryptojew Henry Kissinger believes the world will be 'lonlier without John McCain'--meaning, 'we lost a great globalist today who took great risks to advance our weird agenda (organized crime all over the planet, basically).' URL Kissinger, and by extension the globlalists, have tried VERY hard to get us to believe that the world will be better if its centrally managed by criminals, by essentially burning down everyones house and building a big building where everyones needs are met--that we will eventually adopt a ""COEXIST"" type ecumenical new religion gnosticism, along with other new agey / self-helpish / spirutality types of ways of being--essentially living the GAIA.COM lifestyle, under a technologicially managed socialism with basic income, free healthcare, etc. A Utopia, where all needs are met Sounds great right? Well let's not forget they gave us the war on drugs, the globalization of poverty, the globalization of crime, weaponized migration, weaponized propaganda (fake news, weaponized omissions), they gave us the fail that is obamacare (really a big stick to get you to socialized medicine by creating something so bad it destroys itself leaving only one option--medicare for all), they gave us NETFLIX, violence, violence in media, mass casualty events, suicide challenges, hunger games, increasingly weird pornography, superfakes, AI, military death robots, lady gaga baby drone Christ, Psychopaths in our politics like John McCain, pedo networks, secret societies, weird new fringe religions, human trafficking, mass surveillance, political reprisal, organized crime, cyber gangstalking, perennial war, EMPs, the nuclear bomb. That's what global has done for you Do you really trust the same people who did all the above ""as a means to an end"" to create and run this cyberutopia? I don't. That's why I resist the one world government"

[Trello:HRC's Hamlet](URL --- * &gt;&gt;&gt;CONT * But I'm trying to be a little bit more focused on news items Oh is a legit I don't really don't want to comment on that other name there that I saw--I think I'll just say this one thing about being with Task Force * And we had a lot of good conversations with Thomas Paine a lot of good conversations with Robyn Gritz we're all really trying to focus on a spy ringin Congress * those are the people that are taking the freedom from everyone that runs by here those are the people that are doing the surveillance of everybody that runs by here everybody that walks above well everybody that's down below right * So everyone has an interest in that everyone has an interest in people finding out about things like Task Force did about Eddie McCabe having a 20-year spying history using all the resources of the Federal Government to destroy people's lives that got in their way threatened people business executives threatened business executives even threatened the presidency of a duly elected president * So so we're all in that together * that's our focus our focus should not be on the invent investigating the investigators * So I'll just say that in general Quinn Michaels I love Quinn Michaels I really want to I've never talked to him * But I want to talk to him * And I think we'd have a pretty good laugh of the show he did the other day I I only wish I could tell Quinn I know exactly how you feel * But the person that's making your life miserable * And I don't know how to make that not happen because he's done that * And with me for most of my life * So I want the best for him * And I hope he doesn't want to be a spokesman for McCabe the rest of his life he's certainly sending in 21 page dossier to the port of Charleston certainly wasn't he thinks all that's gonna be bad no the city of Charleston has sealed the records of the high radiation reads by their own admission Chris Whitaker of the JTTF Coast Guard * bring it on Chris let's go for discovery let's talk about those containers let's talk about the awaaz let's talk about the Awan shipping as a matter of fact let's goes for all the bills of lading that our group has come up with let's go through all the bills of lading that you've been a part of let's go through all that your communications to your different JTTF buddies let's get this JTTF communications &amp;amp; freitag in when he was up in New York with Andy let's get the communications with Freitag between him * And Freitag when he came down to Virginia let's bring it all out let's let's have a game--go crazy yes assuming in 20 different states with as long as you're gonna include JTTF is one of the parties I'm in like a hog heaven I'm almost like James elif honest you know * So bring it on * So that's my comment there * So I love I love love love Quint Quinn Michaels I think Quinn just doesn't know me * And doesn't know the other party very well once he gets to know us a little bit better I think he'll he'll be my biggest fan like I already am his biggest fan he's a tremendous person I still think there's hope for some other people I have to admit I'm losing hope I've tried * So much I don't know what else to say about those other people * And who was the other person * And that they wanted me to comment on Oh aim well--everybody has their own * And the more time people spend trying to go against each other is the less time you focus on what the problem is * And that is a spy ringin Congress the oh I hope it's coming in--COINTELPRO the tour targeting great FBI agents * And law enforcement officers who are trying to do the right tank that has to be the focus not who's telling the story all of us are part of it all importance right focus yeah * And let's leave it at that focus is the key as we say goodbye * Now, remember here's my last tip if you come down here don't get on this $60 thing--even though unless you really want the architectural tour or something you're an architect you know * But I mean I can point at that ugly black box or that thing that looks like encrusted seashell or whatever * And say that that's bad that's foul house * And that's a that's not Bauhaus be a u hu h aus that's Bauhaus bo w Hou SD bad bad bad * And I can look at that * And say hey that's pretty good that's pretty good--that's that's not it take the water chassis it's nine bucks * And then say oh I forgot to get off the Chinatown I got to go back * And then let's see we get a lot of comments we're our audience is getting bigger * And bigger * So let's answer some comments geez billy goat tavern we just went to state * And lake satan like what you think of it state lake at the do it on to win * So i've given four stars give it a four stars * and--roast right there is theater district Siskel * And Ebert * And then Fields Marshall Fields * And off-broadway * So if you haven't been to Chicago's a little Broadway I think it's right there on Lake Street be at state * And Lake I mean states easy to remember because Chicago's us I mean Chicago's not a state yeah * But Illinois is oh yeah--Bernardine Dohrn I wanted to I had not done any research on Bernardine Dohrn I'd done a little bit on Bill Ayers * But they weren't actually professors at University of Chicago oh no no no I was there in the University of Illinois at Chicago which is two different things * And there's two different medical centers * So I did not know that I thought they were University of Chicago * So that was that was good * So I think we are going to leave it at that a lot of good comments coming through we've got a lot more people this time let's just take a couple of random things like well if if I let's say hacking teams let's do hacking teams for a second * So that we had a UN hacking team of a twelve * Now, will you do you think that's huma's hacking team at the UN or do you think that's Samantha Power's hacking team that Trump throughout it's probably connected offensive power since she was at the UN she was the UN our representative there yeah * So 260 260 suppose Samantha power doesn't have a security clearance no no spring security plans * But I don't believe the ambass yeah I mean you would wonder that's the this building * So ugly I want to go over here more toward Trump Tower * So you want to come over here more yeah 260 on Matthews this is a big story * Now, do you think you think Mark Meadows representative * Now, sometimes they gun their engines when they're drug dealers for wrong gun your engine if you're a drug dealer for rum * So some I was just gonna say I think that they Awans have followed ROM the most as rob came in as a representative of 2004 I think yeah * And that's when he * But but the ones were down in Florida before that from 2000 to 2004 * But the team that it seems like there's a different team the Russians were in New York to help Hillary with Andy at that little retreat out in whatever the heck that eyelid is Oyster Bay waster Bay whatever that no that that was the one in Maryland okay * But there was an oyster bay one it wasn't quite out as far as Oyster Bay it was on was it as far as Oyster Bay it wasn't as far as East Egg * So I wish that comments was longer because I can't read a minute fast * But moegi Mogi I think I think all the bears what's really gonna become a national pastime are the Bears the CrowdStrike bears this could be like the berenstain bears it's gonna be like the what were those bears that yeah there were those do the berenstain bears toyeah * And then there was the with the Bad News Bears the CrowdStrike bears is gonna become a national pastime with people trying to do the lineups on how many were on each hacking team oh I know what I wanted to say because this didn't come in before I was a part of McAfee * And well we got acquired * And here's a nice little boat coming by * And we had a hacking team of 12 come from Moscow * And these were all the cyber weapons guys * And that was a team of 12 in Santa Clara * And Demetri alperovitz who is in the center of all this Pinchuk * And Prokhorov * And Deripaska * And all these criminals that basically got put we got suits put on them * And then they call them Ola guards * And then they started calling them billionaire or oligarchs * But they're basically FSB criminals right there they're Hillary's FSB criminals well they basically got they took over the whole company they hacked everybody out of the company * And threw everybody out after a quarter we all were--they faked everything it was just a crime time to meet y'all pair of itch what ran that whole show * And this whole group is run by dmitriyevitch all these CrowdStrike bears are all his hacking teams * So everything that crowds for rank is written about as far as hacking teams f-secure has written about which is a kind of a spin-off of crown strength * And it's all from that old McAfee these groups * So that the whole model was proven in McAfee which is bring over a bunch of Russian hackers have them hack above your people * So that your people will go higher * And higher into the hierarchy threaten everybody with soft power I call it hilly came out with soft soft powers basically if you don't listen to Andy * And the fort we've got a underground railroad fill of you with a fourteen-year-old Ukrainian girl well it's either that or--we want aboard a seat on your board or whatever--whatever kind of compromise that we can run * And when what what what I love about your story was that it's the beginnings to understand that our country has been compromised for the last 20 years this operates well yes that's true * But I'm just saying as far as Andy McCabe is concerned this operation of compromises have been going on for twenty hours yeah * So we longer everybody says longer yes longer Bob talking about Andy talking about Andy * And Hillary * right * Now, * we're gonna leave it right there everybody thanks for making Chicago yes we are going to Racine I don't * Again, I want to film it everybody sit talks about Judges going in the river police captain's going in the river police officers going on the river witnesses going in the river why doesn't anybody throw anybody else roof I guess it's cuz of DNA right DNA you get rid of the DNA if you throw him in the river the river was bigger in Wisconsin than I thought it would be at Milwaukee River is a lot bigger than I thought it was preferred choice that's nine days it's people we are well I was three three win in the Potomac when I was when I was recording from the Potomac three win in the Potomac * So anyway there's something in the way there * And I'm gonna try to get another way I guess it's just making the camera a fat finger of the camera * we're gonna wave to the Chicago Tribune for that great article about in 2005 about Imran Awan reading everybody's schedules * And reading all the PDF documents for eight different people in Congress * And we're gonna be very impressed with him * Now, that he's up to what is it I will they said forty five * And here's where I get in an argument with Luke because it's like no that's just what the police report said right this has been going on sixteen years I think it's been not only the house * But I think there's a hacking team also on the Senate side * And I think that's the Fancy Bears I think the Cozy Bears were on the house side * And this is all going to come out such chin is going to be the leader of the pack for the Senate side * And the Imran was kind of in * And all those guys were the runners to go change all the stuff * And will leave you will out show here in Chicago with the beautiful Chicago River that we're hopefully not going to be swimming in soon * So GWS * And WOD contro well we work on that every day we work on that every day hi Connie how are you you have been a great researcher I just want to say thank you to all the great researchers * And that's why I was saying earlier that this is a team effort there's nobody more important or less important everybody's doing their part and * So the researchers are amazing amazing people that are doing what's best for our country they're not doing it for any other reason * And that's why the focus on all the infighting is ridiculous needs to stop we need to focus on the awe-inspiring * And spy ring in Congress oh * And that's the last thing I'll say is I'm going to I'm gonna do Plato this is a part of a bad news bears Berenstain Bears CrowdStrike bears I'm gonna do I'm not gonna do playing cards for all the Bears although it could become a popular trading card game what I am gonna do play lists for all the bear teams * And a playlist for all the Russians * So we're gonna match the Russians with the Bears * And then have the lineups * And then you can have this kind of fantasy league where if you had that hacking tool kid * And you had that acting toolkit you're the Friedmann team * And you're you got to go hack a Trump Tower how are you going to do that well let's go into let's say where do we sell the most suboxone oh yeah that's right spectrum health let's do it in Grand Rapids let's let's use umbrage--we'll have kind of a clue game of how these different hacks were done * But one good thing about Bob Mueller I just heard 35 know how many it's 35 subpoenas for Paul Manafort I'm like thank you Bob Mueller yeah I half of them are gonna be people already in our our show * But I mean let's go ahead * And name the 35 Mueller's 35 I'll start Deripaska broker off bid Chuck Friedman well the Aswan the Dutch kid who's the other guy at BP oil Papadopoulos is coming there Sergei milchin milchin is going to be in there all the Russians I mean maybe this is a break this is Mueller's chance to break away from the whole crime ring yeah I mean if he could just say rack him up I mean I mean I remember thing I've seen it's like no it's actually that would be somebody that you worked with--what I mean a good example the one we talked about was Pinchuk who had given just a charity which Trumps on him volved in a hundred thousand hundred fifty thousand dollars in 2015 oh by the way Pinchuk gave 13 million to the Clinton Foundation * And there's a picture with Bob Mueller * And Pinchuk 2013 standing together oh really yeah oh my my * So these 34 Sweet Home Chicago --- * [Day 176.1 Ryan ISIS Gun Running For McCain Exposed, Awan Air Cover Gone - YouTube](URL * It's day 176 this is part 1 of course Paul Ryan is now out of the House of Representatives * And everyone probably knows his situation in getting weapons now, to Isis, especially in Syria through this Mouaz person * I believe this is going to be a big break for our investigation because the cover and the resistance and all the cover-ups of the Awans that finally there air cover is gone, with Paul Ryan leaving the Senate * And I realize excuse me in the House * Everyone wants to dip into the pay-to-play * Everyone wants to cut into this arms business in Washington DC * But unfortunately it comes with the drug business * And that is just the way it is * And a lot of the earth resources * And extraction industries exploitation of countries as well * So I'm this is really kind of a dingdong the witch is dead kind of a situation * Still a McCain in the Senate as far as the dark weapons alliance obviously * You still have other folks like Lindsey Graham as well * But I do think that this this Dark Alliance now, with the Awans has been broken * And now, we're going to see more stuff come forward in reviewing the videos from yesterday Pinchuk * I think what's always important about looking at these Russian oligarchs, and people gonna say is Ukrainian * I think all these are just basically Russian FSB agents that basically Marc Rich enticed to go down to Ukraine, and get a Ukrainian passport, and then use them to sell Russia by the pound * All the assets, again, all pay-to-play * But what's what I really like is when other folks come out * And do deep dives on the financial backgrounds * And these all these oligarchs it's complicated as DynCorp goes excuse me and picks out these individuals * They always make it they always make it complicated they always do cross-purchasing * And cross boards...and you buy 13 percent of my company * And I've 13% of yours our little round table * I will buy 12 and a half percent of each other's companies, and we'll all make it difficult * But one nice article that did come out was in McClatchy * Here's Newt Gingrich, meeting with Pinchuk in the Ukraine * They're they're meeting in this famous old world war ii conference city of Yalta * And he has this big conference every year in Yalta * And so now, and again, a good article here by Kevin Hall, and Ben Wieder talking about the complexity, which I'm certainly acknowledging that * But this is Mueller again, and his probe, are really I believed he's doing this unintentionally * But he is lighting up all of his co-conspirators * I think he'll end up indicting everyone except himself, which is good because * I don't have anything against Robert Mueller as long as at least some of the folks go down * And what was interesting about this article is the way that he was inviting Trump to this event * And a Trump took as just going down here this this is a brief video appearance that he paid Trump for for the hundred fifty thousand dollars * But this is going to open up all the other all the other pay-to-play speeches that the Clintons did * Again, it's just gonna draw more attention to that * But what I wanted to show was by inviting 200 executives every year, all you need is one Carter Page to go to this event and * Now, you can tag everyone at the event * And as you can see Pinchuk's been very closely tied to the Clinton Foundation in the past * And then he has they've hired this lobbyist here [[Doug Schoen]], who worked on the 1996 presidential campaign * Again, I think these events these events which people have been going to before under the auspices of just meeting other executives they don't realize that * Now, all of their information all Carter Page has to do is shake their hand: here's an invitation to Trump * All Trump has to do is shake the hand of anybody * I believe I'm going to just say it right now, that the original surveillance began on Trump with this hundred and fifty thousand dollar if when the fullness of time comes back * And the onions completely peeled back you'll find that in September of 2015 when the original donation was made was when the original surveillance of Trump started * And I'm talking about the whole Trump family * And of course everyone going to these events is going to be a part of the net of a part of the surveillance net * So I just really wanted to show why the hacking teams why the Pinch Bears * And they were the Pinch Dukes the hacking teams yesterday * That idea that we had that there is these groups of ten or twelve hacking teams these hacking teams are going after everybody that's invited all 200 people * And then you're shaking them down over time you're finding some way to Kompromat them when you're after you've invited all these different people to the events * That's a that's why I want to so closely associate the oligarchs with the hacking teams * The crowd strike bears are so closely associated with all these folks * These folks are really just a member of the team they're so closely associated * And the money they get that they steal from different hacking activities is all one team * They're not separate somehow from the CrowdStrike Bears * They are the CrowdStrike Bears * The pinch bears are pin Chuck's team for instance * {{ 911: there is a cartoon from the 1990s call ""Gargoyles"", basically they got the Elites right. Hacking teams and advanced tech and corporations taking over intelligence. Wow. Who says cartoons aren't instructive? }} * And we're going to go through all the different teams over time * So here's, again, here's Irena Chalupa if people really believe all these sisters all all these three sisters really have the name Chalupa well--I'll let other people believe that sort of stuff * But this is the Atlantic Council again, * And I pointed this out yesterday that this Atlantic Council really was Dimitri Alperovitz of CrowdStrike * It's his little group, and it's his little group where you can have all the different heads of these hacking teams meet * And then you basically go over who all the * And who all the targets are basically * And you sit down, and you figure out where what kind of compromise are we gonna work? * How are we gonna get the money? * And I believe this has gone on for twenty years this was an excellent article in Zero Hedge, where they talked about these the cyber firm that claims to have all these insights into hacking is actually supported by George Soros * They the that Atlantic Council is supported by George Soros * And this actually came out before I did this article yesterday * I wish I'd have seen this before * But it's talking about how this founder of CrowdStrike is very closely tied to the Atlantic Council * And again, I know Demetri Alperovich and this ties in exactly completely * I saw their work upfront at the end of every quarter, writing viruses to drive end of quarter sales * The reason why you attack somebody with the virus at the end of a quarter is because people are trying to close out their financial books * So a lot of different companies roll up their books at the last week of a quarter * And then there's a huge panic if there is a virus * So that's why our attacks were planned * I never was a part of planning those * But I do know that that went on * I didn't work on the McAfee side of the house we actually worked * I worked on the network the network troubleshooting side of the house * So and in in a sense this work that we do here very much is network troubleshooting * And the first thing you do is draw a map of all these entities * And then then the metadata between them and then you start collecting data * And that's just and drilling down that's how it's done in network troubleshooting, and that's been very successful for us here * So I wanted to talk about how CrowdStrike is * So closely associated with the DNC I believe the Cozy Bears are the Awans * I do you believe the Fancy Bears are Suchin on the Senate side * I do believe they have used the Wye River conference center in Maryland for a lot of compromise * It's hard to say how many teams would be nicest see if Trump would publish all of them all six teams of 12 or all five teams of 12 * And we need to drill down on the New York team with Samantha Power * We need to drill on down on who are the five teams in the Washington DC area * I want to put a plug in for the Trello board, because things like when a Paul Ryan sees this wave coming, you just say oh--what this is this is a tidal wave * I'm gonna get out of this thing--things are gonna be going south quickly * Now, that this mo ass thing is out the whole Operation Cassandra [Project Cassandra] Project whatever you want to call it drugs for weapons Awan-Contra whatever you want to call it is coming in a big way * There's nothing you can do about it and every day the tidal wave gets bigger * And then lastly when I was doing me a livestream yesterday with with Task Force * And she certainly had an incredible day yesterday with the McCabe, 20 year actually three decade relationships with Hillary Clinton with the house that he bought in Chappaqua * Apparently there's houses all over that were purchased all over by Andy McCabe * I do believe those are all hacking team houses just like the Awans had hacking teams in Virginia * I believe Andy was involved with the Awans, with other hacking teams * I think we're gonna look at St. Louis here pretty quickly one of the things came up was quantum computing * And the quantum computing, and I remember Quinn Michaels talking about quantum computing * And its use for a wave analysis * And the if you don't remember my little shtick on wave analysis * If this whole screen here can be a one wave, if you will, I only need to calculate the differences in how much the boat moves let's say in the next frame * And I only need to calculate the differential if you will * So if I want to just chart someone walking, even though I may have a tremendous amount of video information, I only need to chart them on let's say if I'm doing a differential wave over here * All I need to do a small amount of pixels of it I'm walking this way in a satellite photo, if that makes any sense * Anyway temporal data systems change its name to temporal defense systems * And I still believe I don't believe I know that they have this capability of replaying your life * And creating a movie which on every American now, right now * And that is scary * Because most people it's kind of like the Snowden thing before the Snowden presentations PRISM presentations came out, you really don't believe it until you actually see it * But you're gonna see it pretty soon * Here's an interesting person that works there that worked at temporal data systems his name is [[Lamont Silves]] * And he works for this company called [[Pathfinder Solutions]] * Sounds ok well he did go to George Washington he's in Tampa sounds good right * But then you drill down a little bit * And then you see he's yet another one of these kind of translators that's been brought to you in America from Iraq-- * It's almost like they have the DynCorp guys * Now, go into his experience a little bit more * Here's temporal data systems it's almost like the DynCorp guys bring over these translators * And then insert them into these different defense companies to do acquisitions of things like the D-wave computer * And then they move them on until the next big acquisition needs to happen * And here of course they worked at DynCorp * And then if you go back in a resume you can just see this over and over defense contractor after defense contractor * Converges * Vangent * But didn't become a citizen didn't bother becoming a citizen tool very recently because they could get away with it * Now, they want to get his citizenship before the vetting occurs * But here's CACI there here's CSC etc * And then just it's a litany of these different small businesses and large businesses * And of course the obligatory American University and George Washington University * And that's your wrap-up for day one seventy six part one --- * [Day 176.2. Paul Ryan - No More Cover For Awans - YouTube](URL * {{ LIVE, lazy fixes because of length }} * We're gonna try * Again, here we are big wind here too much wind yesterday * But we're gonna try to do our River talk with Task Force I think the connection here is working * But we have no viewers * So that's interesting I'll wait for a couple I guess the first thing to consider is Paul Ryan * Paul Ryan is no longer these well he will he's resigning as Speaker of the House he's not going after his seat again, he's not going to run for re-election we of course were in Milwaukee trying to pepper the NEHLEN campaign with different questions about why * So much cover activity for the Alliance almost to the point where we really went to every Congressional office talked about the Awan's * And they all told is sort of the same thing it's going to end in the CAOs office * And the CAO the chief administrative officer has told us that the Awan's are that decision lies with the Speaker of the House we went to the House Committee on Affairs administration House Committee honest raishin h HCA they said the same thing that decision lies with the Speaker of the House we went all over the house * And talked to all kinds of different reps * And they said well to be honest with you the Speaker of the House has told us not to talk about that direct all questions to Speaker the house * Now, this is a spy ringin Congress this is weapons in one direction drugs in the other the operation in Virginia is 200 million dollars alone * It seems like a month excuse me two hundred million dollars a month is that was that the [[ACG]] the [[Annapolis consulting group]] that was based in Imran's home where I found the hard drives where Anthony Taggart said the Government hard drives were the Government Blackberries were the secure Blackberries were with Government markings also with that very funny toner cartridge that potentially ultraviolet toner cartridge that would be making copies of all of all these different places where they might be used like the State Department and other confidential uses * So we don't know the story the whole story yet * But what a lot of folks have remarked that Paul Ryan acted more like a co-conspirator than just someone giving cover to an operation * If you were giving cover to an operation you'd kind every once in a while want to say hey--we realized that this was a bad thing the wants should have been stealing money we're gonna have an inquiry we're gonna push out an Inspector General report * We're gonna say how many we're gonna do it basically a deep dive on what the what they got what they sent to Pakistan how many terabytes what was in each packet here's the amount of money that was sent out of the credit union here's the number of bad loans * And just leave it at that just say * well we got hacked * And here's what it cost us * But we didn't get any of that we didn't get any details we didn't even get pictures until we went to court of any of the co-conspirators we still don't have pictures of most of the co-conspirators * So it leads you to believe * Now, with new developments today that this was half of the equation we were seeing that house half of the drugs in one direction weapons in the other * And potentially there was a Senate side to this operation * So I know how windy it is I know people are gonna complain about the wind in about two seconds * But if you look at all the actions * And this Task Force found this this morning where a Bulgarian man by the name of Andrea of big of Andre Taggart * So it's Andre * And then we think of him with a TV vehicle was arrested in Miami Miami I'm gonna do it like this hopefully you can speak into the mic there * And I could still * So my in Miami * And what was it weapons charge it was weapons Hezbollah was it got a speak right into the mic from the Port of Miami yeah we don't know * So we can look up there's a new name a new entity this could be an important entity I think because many of--[[Andreyev]] Andre evey as the newest billionaire the newest billionaire on the Forbes list he lives in London England * But I believe he also has a place he has a place in rockville maryland I think I think he also has a place out in the madeleine albright school of foreign policy out in denver doesn't he his wife lives at near fort lewis near the disembarkation center * And supply center for afghanistan out in Washington * So it's just an interesting person * Now, we know that John McCain * And bited * And lindsey graham had their kind of hands in the cookie jar in bulgaria working with an arsenal a place called a weapons factory called [[ARSENAL]] making designs in bulgaria from let's say the Raytheon missile systems other defense contractors that were located in South Carolina also located in Texas other ones located in Arizona like Raytheon potentially also Northrop Grumman General Dynamics * And Lockheed so * Now, we have this ACG * And there's a board of about 12 people on these ACG's if you don't remember * And I'll create a playlist out of my I * And my videos ACG * Now, there was five of them one was based in Imran's home * The other one was based I believe I want to say in Alabama I'm gonna say Jeff Sessions right off the bat for that * One in northern Georgia I'm gonna say just over the border from South Carolina I'm gonna say that's probably Lindsey Graham's good consortium * Of course there was one in Phoenix Arizona that's to me that makes sense too to me that makes sense to assign that to John McCain * And then there's one in Texas * So you think of Cora Koren Senator Koren [Corn?--verify] immediately * So will that will help match these up * Now, it just * So happens there's five hacking teams * So five hacking teams * Now, 45 Blackberries 50 Blackberries all this may start lining up if we start thinking about the Senate side selling the weapons * And the house side selling the unfortunately the drugs that go with it I know the rationale the rationale is going to be hey it's a unsafe world we need to secure the world we need to arm our freedom fighters around the world it's essential for the world balance etc * But * So we have to teach them with USAID we have to teach people how to grow poppies we have to do that occasionally we'll have to have modeling contests where fourteen-year-old Ukrainian girls will come to be shown at LOF Singh's island that's gonna--if you don't have until you get your crop going--we have other resources human resources maybe you might want to access * So * And then of course your mineral wealth we might need to have you Mr. foreign defense minister Mr. interior minister give us all your material wealth to pay for your weapons because you're being threatened of course if you're CIA * And running this whole show you want everybody fighting everybody * So that you can be doing a maximum amount in terms of Commission across all the different ratlines right all the different ratlines the problem we're seeing * Now, is this is just not speculation anymore or this isn't just working theory anymore this is starting to look like the server was the house caucus server it looks like ***Ryan was complicit knowing full well this is where the broker transactions were occurring we know that it's not just drugs*** * And not just money transfers the money transfers may vary it may be very well be that the money transfers were on the Russian side maybe through HSBC like the old like the old Iran-Contra which was through BCCI the same kind of London banking * And then the weapons brokering * And drugs brokering was happening through Pakistan just like the old Iran-Contra * So these are this is the set up that it looks like--with the ones we have a real good picture of half of the half of the bagel if you will half of it * But it's not a whole bagel or one hand cannot clap by itself you need to have the drugs coming the other way * And the weapons going the other way you need to bei go with the cream cheese in the middle * And that is going to be the senate side is each was there hacking teams * And we're word is coming in * Now, andy McCabe's buying property in these five different cities were these the five key cities or the 20 key cities we still don't know * But it's looking more * And more like Paul Ryan is more than just a cover up artist in this in this situation the winds died down I'm gonna bring * Now, in our expert analyst our whistleblower well detective turn whistleblower * And your thoughts * So far I'm on the Paul Ryan involvement my thoughts are that--Paul Ryan has probably needed to step down my own personal opinion I think that--every every attempt that we've made to expose whether the once Byron in Congress is just not even met with resistance by the Democrats who we know were had to hire these guys literally * But there's like no Republican support * And then they say good it like you said go to see yeah well the CEO is no more one * So how could ol Marwan--who I met at Imran's house I don't understand how that * And he works in the ECU * So how does Paul Ryan not how is he not aware of this he's a speaker house house leadership not aware of this * And what he's faithful in what yeah I mean Omar Awan could not I mean Omar Awan is not a low-level guy he's he's he's a high-level executive running strategy right * at the House of Representatives he's a high-level executive running strategy * So he has to know Paul Ryan Paul Ryan has to know him that one guy that one day was saying leave the Russians out of this * And everywhere in the cafeteria he very much looked like he was working for Paul Ryan he he said House leadership I think is what he said basically get off the X Day on the Russia a are the stop talking about the Russia thing * And then of course we had their whole Russia thing break * And then the next day I can't remember it was * So some huge rush of story broke the next day * So so anyway your thoughts on that the server your thoughts on yeah well next thing we've got is contempt right contempt this morning you're talking about impeachment needs to start immediately Mark Meadows both for rank * TF: Jordan, Rosenstein * And for roses to those documents Congress is the one in charge it would seize them * And they're not turning it over * So holding them in contempt is one thing * But we saw that for how many in the last ministration many people have said several people are held in contempt * And no documents returned over nothing no action was taking * And these guys are saying it's time to start * And teaching people for not upholding the well the one the one shining light here is whistleblowers * And I know you talk to whistleblowers everyday both from * Now, ever since the Robyn Gritz thing * Now, more Federal whistleblowers you're talking to you yeah it was just state * And local police * And mainly military I think yeah before this * But * Now, it's kind of taking a turn more toward FBI well within all aspects whether it's law enforcement or Government are beginning to come together in a way * And we have strings * And safety in numbers because we tell you she fears and * ***So I think when Paul Ryan resigned yesterday everyone realized oh my GOD this is way way worse than we thought this is way worse this spy ring thing is not just a spy ringit is at least a weapons ring probably also a weapons for drugs mooing we know Project Cassandra it just makes you think that Cassandra is really five operations not just one for Virginia I mean we got a lot of metadata with Tim Kaine a lot of metadata with cory booker a lot of better day with menendez get a lot of metadata for the southern border and different ports we've seen the trucking companies and various people involved even having citations at port in trees in Arizona*** * And it's kind of all the places this ACG has although these kind of trucking companies almost to match the Saipovs it's almost matching the Saipovs * Now, * And I'm wondering if this Andreyevs family that were the new the new entity there's a whole bunch of ondrea's just north of Bethesda in Rock in Rockville Maryland halfway to front of Frederick which is where Mark Lambert is with all the with with all those folks right with all the Kroupniks right right they're doing some on grants that have phone numbers * And landlines connected to Bethesda Maryland interesting yeah may I have this Rod Rosenstein obviously * &gt;&gt;&gt;CONT "

* Crowdstrikes hacking teams are called the ""Bears"" * There's different hacking teams usually in teams of 12 * The Cozy Bears [are] maybe the Awans * The Fancy Bears maybe Suschin * And there's about six hacking teams at that Trump just threw out of the country is * Were they the hacking teams of these millionaires? * Is Trump gonna go after all the millionaires and all the millionaires hacking teams? * We don't really know that yet * But what I did was I put together a quick playlist for all these different entities * So that people could get up to speed on who these different entities and aking teams are * Or just do a quick refresher * So if you don't remember Victor Pinchuk * And the Brooklyn Nets etc there's a quick playlist there if you don't remember CrowdStrike and they're role in the DNC * And their role really through this the last almost well let's see 20 years either as a corporation or as a loose confederation in cabal inside the FBI, then you have that * And then of course Deripaska will add other ones as they come along * Friedman certainly will come along * Pinchuk will certainly come along etc as well as * Now, we also can kind of do threads of playlists through all the different videos we've done with the NGA and different departments * And Deep State actors that the that these players that this kind of McCabe Brennan cabal used to destroy people, either through surveillance or what have you * And I've created playlists for them * Of course there's an Epstein playlist * PDD-62 is this idea of using surveillance to crush people * So there I created a playlist there * EB-5 is the way of getting resources into the country, to man your surveillance etc * And then you can go all the way down here to even Uranium One etc * To understand how machinations of these criminal actors go * And finally I would say there's some ugly attacks yesterday from other YouTube channels as well as other folks that potentially are related to me * And all I would say there is did we expect any different? * Do we expect that these these conspirators, this Brennan McCabe cabal wouldn't have actors and a voice * And actress to act out what they've actually already said in private * That they've already said it in in writing to destroy the careers of FBI agents... * The ugly attack against Robyn Gritz yesterday was really nothing more than giving voice and action towhat McCabe has already done to Robyn Gritz administratively * So it is ugly as it was at least we all saw it for the ugliness that it was * And it really was almost a complete recapitulation of Andrew McCabe's actions toward Robyn Gritz --- * [Day 175.2 Atlantic Council - What Can Our Crowdstrike Bears Hack For You Today?

We don't know * WWas that where Suschin and the fancy bear started? * We don't know, but we now know that I told four new viewers they probably don't remember me talking about when I worked at McAfee * Or we were taking we were a company taken over by McAfee--Network General I worked there in 1999 * And there was a hacking team of 12 * Russians from Moscow * They worked in the weapons they worked in cyber weapons in Moscow * Now, I've talked about this a lot * People have forgotten it * But go back I'll have to do I have a CrowdStrike playlist--you can watch kind of going back all the way * But I said these guys are they're making viruses! in order to sell antivirus software, at the end of every quarter! * It was a criminal activity * Bill Larson was a CEO * Bill I'm calling you out as a criminal! * I reported a channel stuffing at the end of quarter * I got nice I got set up real nice for that * That's 1999 that was the first team of 12 * Now, I don't know if there was teams of 12 before that or teams of 12 after that well there obviously was a lot of teams of 12 after that * Trump just kicked six teams of 12 out * But getting back to the McCabe we don't know if the hacking team was there I don't think it was a nice enough house to be honest with you--you got to talk really loud though because that the bus is that I know I mean Chappaqua is a very small community * And I know it's in a community of like 1,400 * And it's something like you have to look at true pundit's article this ago 1,400 kind of elite community a mile from Hillary Clinton's house her house is probably very nice I'm assuming * So I don't know I know he's sold or resold * And refinancet it also in 2013 I have those documents and * So there I don't know the condition of that house or its value * I know what he sold and resold it for * I don't know what that money from 1998 to 2013 what happened during that time * G: the timing to me makes sense to having a hacking team house like at Awan type house for the run-up to Senate * And of course going up against Joe John F Kennedy John F Kennedy jr. right that's why she they move to chat they John house in Chappaqua to specifically establish residency what you have to have to run for Senate * She was the first lady John F Kennedy jr. was running as that New York Senator * And they bought a house in Chappaqua to run against him * And prevent him from winning that seat * And then that's when his plane somehow fell from the sky * G: right right * And the reason why he sold it in 2011 to a Burgess to its 2013 to purchase to a Burgess removed from the database well it's that's alright it's it's still out there the story is still out there Peter purchase * But it mister NBC CBS or whatever * And he's--NOC buddies right I don't want to say any did the we had anything to do with--JFK jr. by the way I don't want to say that I just said few Task Force just talking about timing * But what we do know is * And I'm sorry about the portrait here I wanted the landscape * So you can see Chicago not well I guess you get to see spy ring in Congress * But the patterns the patterns the *modus operandi* is what's important here the hacking teams of 12 the safe houses * The thousands of wires running out * The removable hard drives the thumb drives * All this stuff was was worked out in the Senate campaign way before they ever got to Washington * Then they sell the house after Hillary's in the Senate twice for the run up for the presidency * She doesn't want to run for Senate * Again, she wants to be president * So they sell the house in 2013 to Burgess * And cash out--and some NOC fund, some CIA NOC fund caches Burgess out * And then they come to Washington * So it that's a big story today * And that's a huge story * And we got to do more playlists that pick up a lot more of Jenny's stuff a lot more Taskforce stuff--the problem is is I got used to introducing you by your fake name to different people and * Now, I got * Now, I've got the bug * Now, I got the other fake name * So there you go * So anyway there's lots of stuff * So we're gonna have to go through * And we did the Deripaska I did the Deripaska that's the derringer coming out of the pasta * We all these guys all these guys go back to Prokhorov * Pinchuk * Deripaska * The original 12 Andy Andy comrades running Kompromat all go together * So Prokhorov was the guy who was going to launder the money through the sports teams * Pinchuk was the more the oil energy kind of guy * They did minerals through Deripaska through ??? * They had they had a funnel for all the drug for weapons business they had * And their selling of the secrets they had funnels for all the different ones all the different Russians represented different money laundering funnels * Do you want to add to that?

Force I think we're good * And then you can speak right into the microphone here * So let's just go through a couple of the well first of all congratulations on your success today today I know how it feels to be well I don't be humble I know how it feels to be in the middle of a story * And then when this story goes big this happen with me with a hard drives I think you're having your hard drives moment--where you go for 200 days people don't believe you don't believe you from for you as a little bit shorter is about four months * But then vindication came today when people did discover that Andy did have a house of Chapel right yeah I think--just doing putting all the research in there's a lot of documents * And stuff that you're trying to weed out * And figure out what's most important * And you stumble upon something like that * And you tried it I be I've tweeted it I sent it I to about a thousand different people how many people I sent it directly into people inside Washington people don't believe it could be possible * And then when it breaks something big it's like just it works--in the ends the research pays off * And the most important part is the truth that's what we're all about * So * And she's very humble about it * And doesn't want it wants the credit Thomas Paine really for verification because it's really those FBI agents that have retired that want the best for the FBI that really do kind of make the story because they verify it they sure that the truth is going out there * And it kind of as that final fact check not not from just--regular people who--who are suppressed kids who want to get to the next self-congratulatory oh by the way we're right under Trump Tower here not just those kids * But real real Intelligence service professionals who can say yes this is exactly what happened * And this is I mean they're trying to bury it already right they're trying to bury the story already things like that you know * Again, I just I give a shout out to Thomas paper being up there * But also to Robyn Gritz * And him * Again, I'm gonna mention her name she's the one that stood has stood up against the ending McCabe we have a spokesman out there I hate spokesman yeah seems like fund me * And support her * And in her battle as she she's taking on the system Thomas Paine's another guy that's been a part of that * And I wanted to say about Robin I mean she's not gonna be like oh I'm gonna go away she's gonna be a part of the solution--she's gonna * And I don't want to say too much more on that * So let's go to the bombing most people don't know we are have a raging bombing campaign right * Now, they think there's Trump sitting on his hands right well there were Navy Navy fighter jets whatever sins * And they bombed a bunch of what was originally called Taliban synthetic labs which is basically where you're--taking the opiates * And processing them in those areas * And then it's kind of come out more honest is this Western Afghanistan or Eastern * I'm not exact locations * But it's coming out--more * And more really running those labs * And where is that stuff coming from it it's Catholics in action right the damn Catholics * Again, are running these drug labs in Pakistan would create a lab wait I think it's the I think it's the cars International League right cars Internet Inc has got I did not realize they had the resources to create labs--that's quite amazing so * Now, do you think Trump will just keep the bombing campaign going while he's kind of keeping the world in suspense that's about what he's gonna do on the other yeah I don't I don't know I think that was--trunks one of his main things was opiate the opiate--the problem in here in this country * And this is a big big big part of the story that people don't understand of how the opiates where they're coming from how its being synthesized in different labs * And where that's occurring * And why he's moms might be dropping on the labs to stop the opiates from coming in * And killing American people * And that's been * And that's been really covered up I mean we really haven't had a lot of coverage on that to be honest you really have to dig there are some like Navy Times * And people I mean it's hard to send kids--up in in to war * And the moms are all like I don't know * And them grandmothers * And the dads * And the brothers * And everything it's hard not to be honest--this gonna show up there's a lot of satellites up there you're gonna see the bombing and * So anyway I'm just seeing that comments for the first time they're close enough * So yeah well we'll try to get the comments as we go * So a couple other stories what do you want to cover a couple of other stories that seem to come to mind the only other thing I would say is that we didn't we try to cover earlier we got to we didn't get a chance to win load about the soldier we were out in daily square * And yeah * And a soldier who has served his country in Afghanistan just to hear on a patriot who has followed George from the first days came up * And said hey scrunchie recognized George * And we got a chance to shake his hand or he knew you to though you knew Task Force yeah I knew * So yeah * So it was a great chance to meet him * And he asked him what we could do better what would be most helpful * And he said you need to have a Chicago whistle doe whistle blower Sunday like you do in DC because they're supporters they want to talk so * Now, I am just quite shocked that we have not had a ROM siren or ambulance a lot of people are calling it the Romulans we have not had a Romulans since we've been down here * Now, roms got to get out of the city at some point doesn't he I mean he's you think it'll be my fire truck--with that booster seat or do you think it'll be a rambling * So Romulus probably gonna be lots of diversions right you might have a Romulus going one way with a fire truck * And a booster seat going another way and--all different diversions * So no one can really follow that yeah rom worked pretty close to state * And lake * So if you want to try to get the Bitcoin we survive we're still are * Now, we * Now, we hear Mark Zuckerberg may be delivering a lot of Bitcoin * But in hand delivering a lot of Bitcoin in Congress today what is your take on you watch a little bit of the testimony what should I watch the testimony mostly yesterday that on the senate * And my take was first of all that when they did it's the statistics of how many of the people questioning mark zuckerberg had actually taken cash for more exact reverse our Facebook's company it's a little hard to question * And fire off appropriate questions * And you can look at Thomas Paine's article on that * And fire off tough questions about what's happening with data in the selling off of data when you're actually taking money from the company yeah I think it was like 30 or 40 Senators had taken * And almost all that sherry had taken money from him * And a like big chunk some money like half a million dollar chunks right before he goes on to the Senate testimony as like they're not even separating pay-to-play with the conjunction to just pay play pay play--it's almost like one word * Now, in Washington * But I'm kind of glad I'm out of Washington to be honest with you yeah it's actually wonderful to be out here with the people that this is these are the great people great American patriots whether they're veterans or bernie bridges or just--people that are trying to do what's right by our country * And get it back to the rule of law * And ethics * And morality at all * Now, now the big news is we knocked out we knocked Paul Ryan of the he's retiring I think he knows the Racine story's coming we're still gonna do the Racine story Paul because we get it's not it's bigger than you * But Paul nellen * Now, becomes the front-runner in that race s * So I think our time in Milwaukee was well spent what are your thoughts on on Paul Ryan yeah well I think it's a little it's probably shocking everyone that he's deciding to resign not shocking to me * So are you ready to drop your connections between Paul Ryan * And Andy McCabe yet or no no I think we're gonna go to Racine * And we're gonna do some investigating there information that we have that may be the ghost signal to start sending right ramya lenses in all directions that may be your go signal go ahead I'm sorry * So yeah I just think we're--we're gonna go to spend some time in Racine * And tell some stories that need to be cooked cold or gay at least get some information out there that people can start doing some research because racing is a big important part of what's going on in our country well just like Hull House are my objective isn't to make any judgments it's just to go to the places--film around it show the metadata * And then people come up with all kinds of stuff * Now, your whole house is gonna be moved oh oh * we don't know that for sure * So all right well we're gonna leave that * So what other news you want to cover there's probably a couple more Senators a couple more Congressmen then I won't be running for reelection seems like a lot of people just serve at the Blues * But--not wanting to run for reelection * And I'm gonna it's going to be very curious to find out their reasoning which I think will come out at a later date * And time about why they chose or whereas yeah * So I'm gonna take questions here for a second as our as our ACOG oh cab goes by our Chicago water taxi--I want to see a little bit about--Bobby Rush Bobby Rush was commenting with Mark Zuckerberg * And we've been in a couple of different Senate meetings where people will mention COINTELPRO * And they'll say Oh COINTELPRO * And then * And we don't run that anymore * And we always have a chuckle on that one that's what Hillary restarted with Andy McCabe in 1998 you're gonna find that this whole process that we've been talking about McCabe maybe not rahm emanuel because he comes in a little bit later * But the whole thing with p tech * And the whole thing with mueller was to cycle up Sibel Edmonds is reporting a lot on this I don't know why anybody else doesn't * But to cycle up * And restart COINTELPRO much much more surveillance much more surveillance from the sky that's our NGA that's why we talk * So much about the NGA that's why the Larry Clayman suit for me that's why we created a playlist for an GA because it's not only about the metadata of you walking of you making a phone call while you're walking up * And down Riverwalk * But it's actually geo-locating you here * And then being able to go back with a d-wave type computer a quantum type computer * And actually replay your life replay your life see where you error every minute of the day * Now, I believe in the criminal justice information system * And that's in Clarksburg Tennessee that's run by a guy named Burrell who was in the Washington field office the counter-intel office with all of his friends like Shawn Henry * And Adrian Hawkins * And of course Andy McCabe * And Bill Priestap here in Chicago they actually have a d-wave * And they can reconstruct any put person walking along here * And their time * So all murders could be solved today they just don't want to let on that they have this time capability Burrell's company is called temporal data systems * So that's that's what it's all about * So anyway I'm gonna take a few questions here as we go * And if you can think of any other news items what am I aware of do all caps what am I aware of somebody has said is somebody's history temporal data systems yes that's Burrell's company we have a spokesman for a McCabe that we normally see at this point along the way who's using every possible Federal agency to point out the fact that I was correct with the diplomatic cover the diplomatic containers shipping their Uranium games Uranium One as well as other games [Music] Silva's * So I think that maybe eat it we I normally can expound a little bit more * &gt;&gt;&gt;CONT"

I have all these women under my thumb that are dependent on me because I'm giving them drugs. I've forced him into prostitution. Maybe their husbands in jail. They'll do anything. What if I was to introduce these strippers or whatever they are to all these bank executives? They'd marry them get half their assets, and then die suddenly."" * And it it is odd because that does seem to follow the pattern * There's another person at VTB that dies * A guy named [[Funin]] at 43 right * And of course he was negligently playing with the pistol and shot himself in the head * And reminded me so much of Gary Webb's death * But then I saw that BTB group in addition invests in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan and in the Ukraine * And immediately to me tied together our whole story as hey I'm going to basically take the Private Wealth Group * I'm gonna go into it I'm gonna look and see who all the customers are I'm gonna get surveillance on all of them by sending Carter Page over and going to an investment conference * Then I'm going to have my I'm gonna send in my Rostanets and we're gonna end up owning this thing * And I'm gonna do this in partnership with section the FSB guy I'm gonna take all these X FSB agents just like in our movie Chinatown * And I'm gonna just put them in as placeholders for all my different investments across the board when I go in and I raid a private investment bank * Is that what's happening here? * I noticed all the affiliate banks was Serbia especially this one here with cyber a Cyprus * So and of course the obligatory China and India connection as well * So we don't know, but it's just a possibility that * I notice just reading this thing about Zhukovki's death * Again, this may be a Rostanet--I don't know how long he was married... * But then there was another guy that I wasn't that wasn't mentioned in that other article said called Alexander Plotkin who was also killed * Was this another Sechin set up? I'm gonna start calling this the Sechin set up was this another Sechin set up? We don't know * So I had a conversation with an FBI agent that I hadn't talked to in a while * And you might be able to guess who that is * And she was saying hey what's coming up on the agenda * And I gave her a quick summary * So I thought I'd give everyone else the summary which was Devin Nunes is set out this ten memo to about 20 I believe * Different folks saying, ""hey how did you come to know about all the stuff in the Christopher Steelee memo?"" * So this is the ten questions from the Business Insider, which reprints the whole dossier okay * And Devin Nunes in this article says there's five memos in all * So again, this next out in light is March the second * Of course we've got the Awan trial coming up March the 5th * And of course I'm gonna be filing a summary Judgement before Glen Simpson tomorrow in DC district court * So a lots happening this week * And then finally someone asked me, ""what do you consider old Mossad and new Mossad?"" * Again, I'm speculating I'm receiving anonymous mails from my cryptographic email, getting seemingly good information from different art dealers * And antique dealers I am speculating * But I believe that Robert Maxwell was kind of that old James Bond style--agent from Mossad, economic spy type of thing * And I'm speculating again, but Ehud Barak kind of takes over in the mid 90s early 90s * And it becomes a much more sinister Mossad * And again, there are plenty of people had said * Now, the baby snatching in Lebanon was way before that in 82 etc * And yes there's there's pushes and shoves in all these things * But I believe Bibi Netanyahu is kind of the last of the old Mossad * And we're somewhere in between * And my association what little I had I believe * Again, this is my perception--not can't prove it--I did have my protonmail account till it was closed down * But I my perception is that there is this internal tension between the Bibi Netanyahu faction--which is the old economic spying--versus the Ehud Barak, kind of when it all costs Anthony Wiener type methodology * So that's the update for part four --- * [Day 130.1 - Nunes Memo Two Preview - Prelude To Pay To Play? - YouTube](URL * It's day 1:30 * And Devin Nunes is about ready to do memo two--there's gonna be five in all * The next ones about the State Department, so I immediately went back to my old slide here looked at the nineteen people * This is sort of the bounding box here, and you probably remember Victoria Nuland was important * John Kerry is certainly going to be important * I had also speculated about Phillipe Reines of course Huma, Hillary etc * Then I looked to the Iran deal * And then also the Pakistani floods deal as two of the key places where I'd start looking * And then of course you've got Cheryl Mills with Black Ivy Energy * You've got Victoria Nuland with all the deals in eastern Ukraine... * You've also got Joe Biden and then even Obama * We remember the whole struggle with not using the NGA phone, and wanting to use the Anthony's trusted staff phone * So here's where I'll try to connect in the Anthony's trusted staff * What I'm trying to do is basically predict the future, which is a lot more mentally-engaging than going back over the PP dossier I guess, if you're a CNN watcher * The next thing I try to do is think outside the box about other people who may also have BlackBerries that could support this State Department communication * For instance John Podesta, of course the Awans, with all the BlackBerry traffic going to Pakistan * And then I try to also think outside the box in terms of medium how about, for instance, Iridium * The Awans have a lot of investment with Blue Sky Link Iridium * And the BlackBerry tracking devices that used Iridium * So then that makes me add other people like Bruce and Nellie Ohr potentially * So I try to include all the people outside of the State Department that may have been communicating with the State Department, to have as many evidence sources as possible * I try to go deal by deal for instance the Palantir password * Or the passwords to the different State Department programs... * I think about people trying to get EB-5 visas like that one guy from Columbia * Of course I think about all the participants potentially in an Iran nuclear deal * And then of course now, we know all about Operation Cassandra * So this may have been a DEA to State Department type of operation * And of course we can't forget all the players in Uranium One * This the Mount Rushmore of Uranium on here * The crushing Kroupniks of Uranium One the 2005 Kazakhstan partners here * And then all the people who may have been brought in as far as on the Russian side to support that as well as on the Pakistani side * All of them together will be a part of the Uranium One one two three discussion * Of course there's the one two three drop box for UAE * But there's one two three drop boxes for all these * So all of these discussions with all these countries--I think there's going to be thirty of them--are gonna be a part of the record a part of the metadata * Of course you're gonna have key people like a Valerie Plame who are gonna be experts in talking about all the to all the NATO nations as well as Africa * That's also going to bring in all the weapons discussions Bouchard, Bilt, etc all these different people * As well as don't forget about war and don't forget about flood--we're gonna have all the Haiti discussions * And of course that will bring in Braverman * We not only have the Becerra's server with the seven thousand illegal logins, and the terabytes to Pakistan, and of course the cash payments to Pakistan, but we have new players like Javed possibly coming into the picture, as well as all the records and participants in these three key Congressional committees, as well as new indictments where new entities are being made available through the discussions, and money-laundering between Podesta and Mr Manafort * Not only in Uranium One, but also megatons to megawatts before it * And then we always have Genie energy, which is always a great way of linking entities * And then we have a key question of was Braverman the leaked to WikiLeaks--the Ratner, Jones, and McFadden deaths * I'll just finish off here by saying I still think Justin Cooper's the key leak for Braverman * And then also we have the death of the guy who did the Dropbox for WikiLeaks * I still say the story ends with Eric Braverman --- * [Day 130.2 Uranium One, Weapons Two, Drugs Three - YouTube](URL * It's day 1:30 this is part 2 * And I think we firmly established Uranium One is all about the FBI * And all the things that go along with the Uranium business * And we know who the Uranium kind of one founders are * But I'm gonna say here this weapons business is the number two * If the one two three Dropbox kind of pulls it all together * And the Awans are really what's concerned or who is concerned with what's in those containers * Now, this story got personal here for one two and three, with me down in South Carolina * I was kind of detained from actually getting to the bottom of the story, as far as one was concerned: the Uranium * But I think that moment might have also stumbled on two and three which was the weapons and drugs business * So this is where it gets quite personal pryed hard drives in April * And now, the containers in June * But I think when the fullness of time goes out--we look at who our partners were * We're gonna find that they were the nuclear partners of Iran and Iraq * And also the weapons makers of UAE or the weapons brokers of the UAE, as well as DynCorp, which was involved in the drug trade * And I think we have lots of historical precedent with Amjad Awan, to talk about hobby wands have been involved in this piece for a long time, which is the drug business * So that's my one two and three * So moving on to the DNC, and looking at the DNC mostly as kind of a cover for this one two three activity * It's almost like a laundry a laundry mat for the money coming through this one two three activity * And everything we really see are kind of just the outer facades protecting that business * And what we really see underneath the DNC structure--the structure in the Navy Yard--is really about managing the logistics of one two three * And the help desk down there probably is not a help desk at all * It's managing the logistics of one two three * And Chicago the same way * The MIS departments probably managing the logistics of at least three the drug business--if not also two as well * But isn't that why we have those control points with DNC in those places * And so here's two which is the containerized weapons business * And we've seen this with club K * This is the whole Gulftainer deal * Isn't really this all about container izing weapons for rail cars and ships and trucks...this new form of covert weapons that * Now, we can store these containers anywhere in the world any port in the world * And we can sell them to anywhere in the world * So NATO becomes a key customer in all of our dealings * Doesn't that really explain why there's * So much dealings with NATO here with KKR David Petraeus * And isn't this the new weapons of the future * And then finally 3 are the Chopra's up in Chicago with the MIS Department * Aren't they really just kind of a front * Couldn't may just be a front for the Awans and this drug for weapons business? * Couldn't all these ports and all this activity that's coming in Detroit, and other cities in Florida...really just be the pain clinics just be a front for this drug business? * Isn't the deals that we've done in Pakistan, that Rahm Emmanuel's helped Imran Awan's father with, isn't that really a whole program of poppy farming, through USAID? * Here we even have them putting us aad farms on as pomegranate farms * And then finally the whole convenience store business and the hospital business and the fake doctors * And all the distribution network for drugs isn't really drugs number three in our scenario? --- * [Day 130.3 Drugs On Miami Beach? I Will Order Some Mangos - YouTube](URL * It's day 130 * And I just heard a commentator on Fox say the media is alive and well, and they're gonna drill down to the bottom of the Russia deal * So I'll help them here * Again, I didn't say this * One of the key architects of Uranium One said this, that the Russian involvement was these 13 people these 13 people are what disrupted the United States I have yet to hear anyone in mainstream media name the two people that got into the United States * Bogacheva and Krylova * I have yet to see anyone make the connection that there are attorneys * I saw one news article excuse me that mentioned that Bogacheva was an attorney * And I just found it it was also very funny that there's a attorney by that name Bogacheva with a picture that matches one of the people that's in one of of EB-5 law firm very close to Debbie Wasserman-Schultz * So I'm gonna keep drilling down * If you remember, here's a six million dollar hotel--this Starlight partnership--which I believe is the Starlight hotel * And we're gonna go there * So if you don't remember: here's where the parklands shooting was * Again, we have Krylova on that street * I still like to think that's very odd * We have the Snead's on the same street as the 6160 as we have the guy from Maryland here coming from the Central Community College of Texas Central Texas College going down there for quartermaster school, staying at that same location * And a bunch of Cruzes * And 35 911 calls that we haven't drilled down on * So if the media is alive and well they'd be drilling down and listening for those calls, and seeing what kind of calls were generated calls * I think you're gonna be very much like the Awans here in Virginia * And also I believe the Awans may have spent time at that house at 6166 that we talked about * The area up a little bit further north up the beach at The Diplomat Hotel * And now, just on the other end of the beach here's the 750 Ocean Drive * So if we look at the hotel actually the six million dollar hotel--it's one of these cute Art Deco hotels * I've actually been down this boardwalk, and I visited these hotels they're very expensive for how cheap hotels are it's like $300 a night * It's all about chic it's all about making connections * And I believe that if you don't believe that the drug business is alive and well that this part of Miami Beach, well you've never been to Miami Beach is all I can say * So I'm just not too far down here we're gonna go down the street a little bit * There it is in a different sunlight * And you're not gonna believe, but you're gonna have the famous mango bar mango bar right here * So Tropicana mangoes * So literally this is * And I've been threatened by drug dealers--I believe right here * I'm standing out here, some kind of a it's somewhere along in here basically I was threatened * And said if I hang around here anymore I'm gonna get killed * I can't it's gonna be somewhere in here * But you usually remember death threats * And that is something that I think was very close to this * But you can see this is a very high-end meeting spot here * I'm not saying that the Bogacheva's necessarily involved in drugs * But this is at the heart of Miami Beach here * And this these are this part of Miami especially--this this old Art Deco part of Miami is where the drug business thrives in Miami Beach --- * [Day 130.4. House of Cards Collapsing As We Speak - YouTube](URL * It's day 1:30 * And it's part four * I noticed that Devin Nunes sent out his ten questions letter * Basically how did you hear about Christopher Steelee? * And then who did you tell about Christopher Steelee? * Did you have any meetings...so kind of getting at the--the phone tree * And how the phone tree expanded? * It went out to more than 20 people * And I notice our list of people that didn't that use Gmail at the State Department was 19 * I certainly hope that Devin would expand that group beyond the 19 who use Gmail * To all the people that were assistants for those people * As well as people like Sid Blumenthal * People like Carter Page * People like George Papadopolis * I know it doesn't seem like those Navy Intel guys may have worked for the State Department * But ask the question, ""Carter Page have you ever been on the transition team for Hillary Clinton in 1992 to 1993?"" * That's pretty important you're the center star of this whole investigation * Did you ever work for Hillary Clinton? * Seems like a fairly straightforward question * So anyway it's this it's this questioning * And these rounds of questions where where there's a whole bunch of conspirators, and they can't get their story straight * *They always collapse* * So it's my it's only a matter of time, now, for all the dominoes to fall unless--Devin Nunes gets hit by a truck * I think it's it's over * In the same way in the lawsuits * It's the same same thing * One hand washes the other * What I discover goes over to him: what he discovers comes back over to us * So it's it's a beautiful thing: *it's gonna it's going to collapse* --- * [Day 130.5 History Is Made In Minutes, Not Days - YouTube](URL * It's day 113 this is part five * And Task Force * And I broke the story about a month ago * And then other outlets picked it up * And good for them * And I want them to have the scoop * But we were the first ones to break the story that Carter Page--the centerpiece of this whole impeach Trump--this star witness--this whole narrative of Carter Page being the super spy--we were the ones, one month ago, to break the fact that Carter Page worked on the Clinton transition team in 1992 and 1993 * And we also added the fact that he worked for Omar Awan in San Diego in 2001 * Now, Sean Hannity has him on the show tonight * Will he ask him that simple question? * Did you ever work in Navy Intelligence? * Did you ever work in the Clinton transition team? * It seems like such an easy question when the presidency is at stake * I've been going back and editing old videos * And I had these times where I felt like there's such a simple black and white truth in front of the American people * This was the pryed hard drives * And this was talking to the American people talking to Andre Taggart saying Andre you need to come forward talk up these pryed hard drives * This is your time * And Here I am in Times Square, calling out Andrew Taggart * The next day * The next day Imran Awan is arrested * Not only laptops with government markings--there were Blackberries * There was a pile of Blackberries 20 Blackberries with government markings * And that is the key the key right now, to the entire case falling apart * And for this whole saga to be over for this whole house of cards to fall * Andre: you are on the world stage right now, * The whole world is looking at YOU * And that's really what happen reacting when a month later Andre Taggart finally comes forward after the interview one * And today's date 3:13 I am so glad Jason got to do that interview * I thought it was an incredibly good interview well done the--on the number of Blackberries thing * The only thing that I've said that may be a little bit off is the number of Blackberries * I thought he said in in the file that I filed I said ""pile of Blackberries"" * And the court documents I filed gateway pundit has their version that they sitting up in the Capitol Police or some leak * Andre said he did wasn't exactly sure maybe it's three or four it was a dark bag * There's so there's some question about the number of Blackberries * And that that I totally admit I was trying to put the numbers together--I was trying to put the twenty from the Congressional report from the twenty from all the reporting that was in the Kaelin letter the Kaelin report * So maybe maybe I've slotted that in there at twenty * But I do want to talk about the timeline here * I think Andre did say that I came out with a story * I was canvassing the neighborhood * Yes I was canvassing the neighborhood * Yes I was * But--I think I would agree with him I spoken about fifteen minutes * And really the only the only hard part I had with this whole thing was: I had sent the information to Luke that night * I didn't want this story I wasn't looking for myself at all * I had sent this information to Luke * And I didn't publish Andre Taggart's name initially, for about a couple two weeks or so, maybe longer * About 30 days in though, I started just thinking ""these guys are going to get off"" * This is Imran is it's gonna be a hand slap * It's gonna be a wrist slap * They're gonna get like a bank fraud charge or something like that--this thing is not * ***This the spy ring is not going to be unseated*** * And so I really had that kind of moment where I had that same ""marine moment"" that he did, only I guess would be an Army moment since my dad was in the Army * But I felt like I was on Little Round Top myself, where I only am left with rocks * I mean I've already done everything I can * I had thrown every Rock I can, I'm out of ammo, and here comes the enemy * And the spy ring is going to take over in Congress * So I did what Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain did I said ""fix bayonets""--I said ""fix bayonets"", meaning I had to publish the name * So that other reporters people were saying I made it up * Other YouTube journalists were saying I made that encounter up ones that everyone knows here * So I was in between a rock and a hard place literally * With Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain rocks-- * My sons named after Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and Joshua tree * So that was the decision I had to make to give it to somebody else, because Luke didn't call * Maybe he did call but he waited about 30 days * This whole thing I didn't never try to be a famous guy here or be theorist * I gave it to Luke * Luke waited 75 days to break the story * And all the long I'm doing--five six videos a day some you know * Again, I want to say I thought this was exactly what I wanted * We don't even need Friday * Today Andre Taggart destroyed destroyed the prosecution's case * Andre Taggart just destroyed the prosecution's case * I was trying with all kinds of motions * And talking to lawyers * And doing everything with this big paper chase with a pile of--circumstantial evidence * Andred Taggart with one hour, with one hour just destroyed the prosecution's cave * And I'll just leave it right there * And just say that I--if you go back to July 24th of the day before the Awan indictment * It is some of the work that I'm most proud of, because I'm the most declarative, in very short videos * One to two minute videos, I think I make the case that this spy ring in Congress cannot go on --- * [Day 131.1.

Not mine * And then hey you get all the stuff * You sign a deal and then in 2005--with a guy who owns Kazakhstan--and you're in business for Uranium one * The follow on to that is ""well you need to put people under surveillance"" * So you need to send Carter Page over there in 2004 whether or not he knows he's being used as a surveillance rabbit doesn't really matter * You just have him calling everybody who has interests in the Uranium that you want * And then you can start up surveillance * And then *dossier* them * And then figure out some way to compromise them * And away you go * To me that seems like what we have here in terms of metadata * We have a professor at Duke our names Krylova * Seems a lot like the Krylova in the indictment * I'm not saying it's the same person * But it would good to have somebody at Duke making that type of analysis of 'who are the people that own these business interests?' * It seems like it would make sense to have somebody like a Bogacheva--the Russian lawyer in Miami--to identify who are the honeypots that we can bring into this situation for that kind of compromise * It seems like once we did compromise and got that whole *modus operandi* developed in Russia, seems like it would be smart, if we were over here in 2014, to set up different reps in the United States in different areas that would be supportive of our presidential run in 2016, by maybe taking small hard drives or giving or thumb drives and giving them out to different people in different Congressional races, in order to win those Congressional races * And it seems like when the election was over in 2014 at the end of November we would submit our expenses * And then we would check out, and go back to our regular lives * Maybe at Duke and Maybe in Florida * That's what it seems like then we could have some other people come over * And do 54 dollars worth of Facebook ads in Wisconsin * But if you look at the actual indictment * THEIR indictment: not my indictment * It says hey, ""toxic cloud September 11 2014"" * They went to these eight different states * They said they bought hard drives * They said they bought these cameras * They said they bought these phones * That's those are devices used to pass information to people * Are we sure that they weren't helping different people, in different elections? for between September 11th and November 26, when they turn their expenses in? * To me it seems like they were trying to influence the elections * This is before Trump ever even thought of running for president * To me it's they were influencing elections, creating panics * They were creating panics of toxic cloud in Louisiana * Race riot type situation in Atlanta * And then we also had the Ebola scare in Atlanta * To me it seems like they were directly trying to effect something that was going to happen in November, like November 5th like an election * Seems to me that they went around to eight different states, to try to influence election, and we're giving information to the people that were then *dossiering* the candidates that they were running against * That's what the metadata says to me * Again, their indictment not mine --- * [Day 131.3 Secure Blackberrys For Military Port Congressman? - YouTube](URL * NO Autocaptions Entities only * Apocalypse Now clip * Cavalry * Ft.

Where are we going to do joint ventures? * So I would have somebody in a cover position like this the Department of History or something like that * And it would be good to have them close to the Special Operations Command over there in Fayetteville we can work closely together using our military and political resources well * So this would be a good put a spot to put somebody at Duke University * They're close to David Grange at Duke University * We could figure out where the goods are where the Uranium is or where the oil and gas is * And then we can use the military to go get it just they go together like peanut butter and jelly * So here she is this is again, a good person to use as a model of someone that we would put into a position * She's been at Duke for 13 years, so I'm sure she's a great history professor * I just thought I'd look in a little bit what she's done she wrote this book about Soviet women in combat * So she's obviously accomplished in terms of feminist studies, as well as Soviet women in combat * But again, this allows you to kind of look over the sweep of history * And to me, this is is kind of like these women--these Soviet combat women would be the perfect people to go into the FSB * This is a high-risk, type of thing * If you're found out it's international espionage etc, so you you're looking for people with courage * So people that would go to a seminar like this Soviet women in combat would typically be very good to recruit as potential operatives not saying that she's involved in that at all I'm just saying this is a this type of history professor with courageous women...would be a good place to kind of recruit Natasha's or Rostanets * Here she is this is an accrual over she's at this Islamic factor in 1979 talking about the Islamophobia * &gt;&gt;&gt;CONT"

Keep An Open Mind On Yellow Cake and White Cake Distribution - YouTube](URL * Day 137 part 4 I'm putting up part three * So I don't know exactly when that'll actually end up rendering * And yes the hair cut is short * But what I was trying to do with part three is just background I'm not trying to make any statements or anything * I'm just trying to get everybody to think about background in the sense that Uranium has to come from Kazakhstan to the United States * It's being processed in some way * In Uranium One it has to leave the United States it's being processed in some way * So all I'm really trying to do is just share with you videos of how Cameco does that processing * How closely Cameco and Urenco or tie together * Cameco it's kind of like Schinkolobe way mine in Wyoming * There's a big mine in Saskatchewan where the kind of the technology was developed * There's a big mining the middle part of Kazakhstan kind of down toward near Tashkent * So I'm just trying to get everybody to to see that the credibility of deeb Uranium when he was talking to me over * So long ago like a year ago * And the number of people that Deep Uranium is talking to and about is is a lot of people * So there's a lot of different perspectives * So that's better than just one perspective, although I saw--with Tony Schaffer's book it's a five month--heart of darkness book or our dark heart * I kind of call it heart of darkness because he's kind of going into one part of Afghanistan * And he's talking about the operations in one part of Afghanistan * But really Deep Uranium is really like 12 dark hearts or however many people are involved * And it's over a lot longer period of time--it's over decades * So there's I'm not trying to write heart of darkness for Deep Uranium * I'm not trying to do that * I'm just trying to say that there's a lot of experience there about how you get Uzbeki truckers * And how you get the Saipovs * And I get the families * And how you recruit them * And how you bring them in to the areas * And then how you train pilots * And how you--how the yellowcake * And white cake come together I guess is what I'm trying to say * The yellowcake is is not as valuable it's going to travel by ~~tree~~ truck * The white cakes extremely valuable, it's like more valuable than gold * Although once it gets to be yellowcake it starts going up in value Uranium * But how the two kind of get married together in Pakistan is the key idea that I'm trying to get across * And then as it comes over then then they both go their own ways I mean the Uranium is gonna go its direction toward--nuclear fuel uses * The power plants the weapons uses the experimental reactors... * And then the white cake is going to go its own way * The white cake is gonna go toward universities typically and large metropolitan areas, towards universities with the SEIU janitor or * And it's gonna be the SEIU janitor * So so when you when you see this path--the yellow and the white coming together * The yellow on top white on the bottom coming over to the United States * It's it would obviously take differing routes I mean the Uranium is gonna go in the direction of those customers * And the white cake is gonna go in the direction of those customers which is a lot more bigger Network is what I'm trying to say * So try to keep your mind open to how actually this product is moving * We have the Maersk and other types of vessels pretty well worked out for the long blue deepwater part of the thing * But then how does it actually move to the universities? * How does it how is it moving around, especially the white cake * So just--I'm just going on based on what you Deep Uranium saying * Is it the white cake moves by plane, it's too valuable * And it you don't want a chance of it being intercepted along the road * Now, I'm sure some comes along the road, and comes into Fort Huachuca, down there at the international port of Huachuca on the Arizona border * But once it gets there it usually it flies, until it gets to these regional airports * So just just keep your mind open to that keep your mind open to--these fly-ins were--everybody flies into the Flying J ranch * And all the motorcycle gangs come in for the weekend or all the rich guys come in for the weekend or whatever those are * And then everybody goes their own separate ways * Those are the types of things that's the kind of thinking off the chart off the grid kind of thinking that I'm trying to encourage * Again, I'm not trying to solve the case all at once * I'm just trying to put out there the type of out-of-the-box thinking that it's going to take to actually, when the emails do come, when we finally do get the emails, we'll have a better wider purview a wider perspective to be able to put all the pieces together * For instance, if you just think they're gonna say we need to ship the drugs from Pakistan to here, it's not going to make a lot of sense * But now, when you have an admiral in the Navy negotiating with somebody in Pakistan, which Haqqani and you've got Mike Mullen negotiating for three days with Haqqani the Foreign Minister of Pakistan it starts making sense rather than reading everything literally keeping it open you kind of keep you an open mind on the whole end-to-end traffic --- * [Day 138.1 How Many Cameron Ross Burgess Can One Country Have? - YouTube](URL * It's day 138 * And this is in the news with Devin Nunes the house the ten questions the famous ten questions going out to all these different folks * About twenty I think * I don't know if it's the blackberry twenty or not * But John Kerry is probably one of the people that didn't return the ten questions * He's probably one of the people that didn't answer when did you know about the Steelee dossier * But he had a second another Jonathan Winner * I'm gonna call him Winner * But a call him John Andrea Jonathan Reality Winner * He had a second write an op-ed saying here's the story everybody reminded me so much of Fusion GPS and Glenn Simpson the five thousand pages of testimony or not five thousand but three hundred pages of testimony to get everybody on the same page * The only problem is is if you're the person who started off the whole chain, the people that are downstream, their cover story isn't good enough * You have to come up with something else you have to come up * If you're actually the one trading information was said Blumenthal and trading information with Christopher Steelee, you're gonna have to come up with a different story if you're at the beginning of the chain * And that's exactly what's happening right now * And everyone asks why don't you cover this more? * And I all I can say as I did * This was a year ago it was the nineteen a male's it was the Blackberries it was the Awan Network * So we just had kind of have to wait for MSN to kind of come into this story * But it's good to know about Reality Winner and Fort Gordon, Sweet Tea and so forth * So that every time we see a winner we know it's a winner, but we know it's a Reality Winner, and we know it's an information operation * So let's say you did have an operation in Afghanistan * And it was a forty year drug operation, you would have secret memos * You would have secret memos, because you don't want everybody to know about the drug operation * And if you were in the Navy, and your name was Admiral Mike McMullen, and you were running NSA, and you were dealing directly with a terrorist named Haqqani--who runs the Haqqani terrorist network--you wouldn't want a whole bunch of memos out in WikiLeaks, talking about your negotiations for this drug business * But in this case Mike McMullen was saying hey you've stabbed us in the back * So many times over our 40-year history I want this one in writing * So and where are they dealing they're dealing in London just like the Christopher Steelee * Again, MI6 its liaison loophole * I don't have to report any of this to the American people * And bang there you go--that's how these things are done I do them through Australia: five eyes * Or I do it through MI6 five eyes * Now, let's say you've run this for 40 years * And I'm not saying Ron Burgess has run this for 40 years * But let's say--you're an Auburn University grad you're a--you're an Army commander * Now, the Army and the Navy compete right Army-navy game right * The Army has sort of had the Cyber Command first * And then the Navy's always had the NSA * So they've kind of been in competition * Now, recently they put them under what they call a dual hat * Now, Trump's trying to separate those two * But back in the old days when Army had Cyber Command, wouldn't you want to develop a whole bunch of cyber kids, that would then go over to Fort Gordon * Fort Gordon here is where Reality Winner was right * She's working in this CENTCOM area--this Fort Gordon manages the CENTCOM area * Wouldn't you want your people managing all the messages going back and forth--all the secret memos--so they didn't become public and WikiLeaks * Wouldn't be that'd be what you want wouldn't you want to be informed about what was going on down here if you ever went to Washington * And became the head of the DIA in Washington DC would you want to send a whole bunch of emails across the wire--a whole bunch of secret memos like Mike McMullen did * Or would you have kids down here your spy kids come up to the White House * And then go into the SCIF the secure area like I said happen with Devin Nunes in March of last year to from Alabama * And if you were also running a drug operation where you're flying drugs, you would want to come down here to Fort Rucker * And I call it Mother Rucker yesterday * That's what affectionately Army pilots call Fort Rucker, which is mother rucker * This is not only where you go for your basic training in flight * But it's also your advanced training all throughout your * So you always keep going back to a mother Rucker this is down at Fort Benning in Georgia right * So in all these air strips in in Alabama have been supposedly used like Mena airports * This was Mena airports that these were Mena airports before Mena * And before that movie American Made * George Wallace supposedly had this deal Eve way before Bill Clinton was in business * So again, you would want to develop a cyber Institute at Auburn--your old alma mater * You'd want to develop these cyber kids that would go over here * And make sure that like Reality Winner * And and Jonathan Winner * And all your other winners * But you would want them to keep things quiet--keep it on the down-low * Same thing with your planes and your flights * And you want to keep it close you don't want to have these operations going all around you know * So they can be easily intercepted * You want to keep it tight so that you can manage it right * So let's talk about if you're running a drug operation * And you go to war * And the whole United States goes to war * And you're going to attack Afghanistan even though Saddam Hussein supposedly has these weapons right * You have to have some kind of some story you have to have some story * Now, I'm not saying Toni Schaefer knew at all that he was being used as a matter of fact it's better if the person doesn't use it this is good if you meet Tony Hsieh freeze the nicest guy in the world * And he's the most honest person in the world * But if I was running a 40-year drug operation I would send him in to the heart of darkness to a part of theater that wasn't where I was doing drugs or mining operations * It's a diversion--it's a throw * And operation dark heart would be where I would do it * Now, people say oh--how do you know Ronald Burgess Tony Shaffer * Well here it's all these redactions you go through * And you look at Tony Schafer's book here's the book here's all the redactions * And that Shaffer excuse me that Ronald Burgess did I told Task Force last night * And I just read the book by going to the redactions * And there's a unredacted version printed as well * And then basically you can almost fill in the blanks * Oh that's Anacostia when he goes to headquarters--that's Anacostia at DIA five eyes * That's where the woman looked me straight in the eye and said you're never going to stop the drug business * We got five eyes, we're gonna be playing whack-a-mole the rest your life all right * And he's the guy who did that if you didn't if you don't believe that here's the Sydney Morning Herald dia director Ronald Burgess issued a memorandum a blah blah blah saying this couldn't damage national security * I would say ask Tony Shaffer do you know Ronald Burgess * Yes think he does he does * So and let's move on * Now, let's say you had a bunch of kids going to the White House right you could have a whole bunch of kids--with these secret dumb drives that if they're caught, you are immediately implicated and you get to go to jail * Or you could use a baby's name * Let's just say we had a Cameron Ross Burgess died after about one year as a little baby * You could adopt that for all your camera * And Burgesses right all your Cameron Burgesses have about 15 different Cameron Burgesses * You're saying George no way they'd ever do that adopt somebody's identity, and then bring people into safe houses, and then have them get jobs * And everything in a false name wasn't that exactly what the Awans did here * And with all these safe houses in Virginia isn't that exactly what they did? * And the beauty of having a camera named like an Australian name is I could bring in Australian guys * And just call them Cameron Ross Burgess--They all can be Cameron Ross Burgess * As a matter of fact, we've identified one George Soros guy who has books very much like Tony Shaffers's book excuse me with operation dark heart right very much like Cameron Ross Burgess * Now, let's suppose somebody figured this out let's suppose some journalists figured out: ""hey hey hey I know what they're doing they're bringing all these Cameron Ross Burgesses to the front gate of the White House, there it is they're bringing all these Cameron Ross Burgesses's to the front gate of the White House right"" * So here's the White House right here here's the reviewing stand where the inauguration parties are there's the White House obviously there's the North Lawn * There's little roses in there * And then there's a big Rose Garden in the back, right * So you can see it there you would come * And where he was shot here is right along the gate right here somewhere let's zoom out a little bit * Now, somebody said did they actually shoot him from the Washington Post * Would a sniper could have sniper have line of sight on that area from the Washington Post * And quite frankly I don't know because in between you've got about a seven or eight story building here which is the Veterans Administration by my odd luck right * But you do have it's it's actually a fairly short two or three Street shot * Now, this helicopter that came out from behind the South Lawn here Marine, one normally goes that away to excuse me let me look at the White House here * Again, one of these two directions to Andrews Air Force Base * And I can't remember which direction * Now, let's see that would be this way it would be this way this helicopter * And we were standing about right here on K Street * This helicopter came right over I mean it was like it was like I took a beeline right at where the shooter was * And there was a second helicopter that went down this way * And I'm not sure if that's Massachusetts Avenue or not I have to look at it * Again, but wouldn't that be some response if you were a Burgess or if you were not a Burgess, if you were against a Burgess as a white hat or black hand we don't know which we don't know who's who yet we're just collecting metadata * But wouldn't that be a way of saying hey I know exactly where it came from * Now, remember this White House has the most sophisticated sound location echolocation capabilities in the world * So they can immediately locate a threat, infrared echolocation all that sort of thing * Wouldn't it be smart as if you were running this show here to take those and fly directly over where the shots came from? * I'm not I don't I have no idea where the shots came from * But there was two loud booms about a second half apart I do have an eyewitness that said that * So what how many Cameron Burgesses have come to this gate? * If you sit here in the White House you can see your Cameron four Jess they can make a phone call they can get on the phone, and say hey just here at the White House I'm here for the tour, right * This is how the other guys did it when they came and saw Devin Nunes * And then they come over meet you at the north gate * YOu go into the Eisenhower building here at the SCIF * Give them the hard drive you've given them the thumb drive * The thumb drive goes into the computer you download all the information * And then you immediately crush you immediately crush the thumb drive * That's how it works that's what happened in March * That's why I said two guys came up from Alabama didn't know * That came from deep deep finance is that what's happening here? * Or is it not what's happening it was one shot from here * And one shot from there well we really don't know * We can't get cameras from this building * There was a fixed camera here from the CBS camera * We can't seem to get cameras * We can't seem to get any information or pictures or even the whereabouts or what this guy's studied * The only thing we have so far is that he lived on briar patch lane with a bunch of trailers * And none of the people on his briar patch Lane ever saw him * Well graduate from Auburn--4-year degree * I don't think he's going to go live in this little town on briar patch Lane * I think maybe one of the guys who's is one of his distributors to the Crimson Tide at Alabama, for all those USA Alabama graduates * But not for Cameron Ross Burgess --- * [Day 138.2 A Star is Born As We Revisit Imran Awan's Hawkshead Drive - YouTube](URL * It's day one 38.2 * And I don't normally just take a lead from a comment on YouTube with a an address * And just do a report about it this 7681 Boston Boulevard * But it was interesting because the commenter said there's this weird airline called ASTAR all one word a star immediately thought of course of MedStar * And all the other stars--the red star grille it's a good way if you people don't speak the language, you say look for the star * You see a lots of circles in signs you see a lot of different things * But a red star is easy for somebody even if they don't speak the language to pick out that sort of thing * Go to this hospital the one with the red star etc with the med star so * But it's such a good reminder of all the things we've covered in our series I thought let's go ahead and take a chance * Now, Customs and Border Protection is also at this location DHL is also at this location * So it could be a clearinghouse of some type * But then there was a port of Moses--that was the one that really got me at this location * Port of Moses * What the heck is Port of Moses maybe it's just--who knows where they've opened the red star seas or something I don't know * But I thought that was interesting * So back here at Hawkshead--here I was Imran one... * And Hina Alvi down here * And then of course you've always got your pollution control * I always think that that's a cover for something else-- * If I was gonna if I was going to reduce opium I would do it at the pollution control plant * Nobody wants to go near the pollution control plant and it's never gonna get busted * But anyway 7681 just kind of interesting * And I'll put a street seat on here * But there's our Davison Air Force Base * There's our fly-in fly-out * This these are the ones where people say hey all times a day or night from Fort Belvoir here * They're flying these helicopters * Now, Andre Taggart lived right down in here and I forgot his address * I did a show about it but I couldn't pull it up * But here's your helicopters here level five security that I did a show on it * Couldn't get ya closer than the fence * Here's your defense Threat Reduction area agency right this is at believe is that NRO * NRO is the National Reconnaissance area * If you're gonna spy on everyone in America you start at DTRA--it's defense defensive production area * Where else is with their Defense Threat Reduction area? * Well there was one over at the Navy Yard building 213 underneath the ground where--you can almost feel the fiber out there on the John Wilkes Booth bridge going for over to Anacostia for Imran to get out from the John Wilkes Booth phone booth * So you got everything here * And of course you've got the 4809 Sprayer street with the Freitag low-light cameras * And the American innovations server out there * And the nd the ma heater unit you got rail changing tapes over there * So you got really a whole story right in this little stretch * It's such a good it's such a good little stretch I can't even return to it * And then--if you move up it would then of course the obligatory of Northern Virginia Community College * And you even have Laurel Laurel Hill of golf club over here * It's really got something for the whole family this thing * And then--not too far you got ""Mason's neck"" where the Masons crack your neck, right, if you talk, right * And then you've got your own access to the sea you've got your Veterans Memorial Park there * You got Potomac Vista where Mahmood lives * He watches all this stuff all this small boat traffic coming in going from these two parks * And he snaps you're Mason's neck if you get out of line * They're the ones--MS-13 is the ones that call him el Senior not me * So MS-13 calls him el senior not me * Do you think he's the enforcer who knows who knows do you think they hide at the Pakistani embassy who knows * But we'll just take that for what it's worth right now * You know I there's the consulate of El Salvador this is where I go get on my MS-13 * And they're going to end up right in here in Mason's Neck Park after the jobs over with --- * [Day 138.3 Did Feinstein's Hubby Really Ground His ASTAR Planes? - YouTube](URL * It's day 138 * And this is part three * And this is the follow-up to the ASTAR video that I did earlier today * Turns out that not only was this gentleman Jonathan Dasburg who used to run Northwest Airlines involved in DHL * And a star Airlines * But Richard Blum B L U M * Richard Blum who is famously married to Diane Feinstein another member of the Senate Armed SELF Services Committee is also involved in buying DHL z-- planes * And turning it into ASTAR in 2003 * Now, you probably haven't heard of Richard Blum much * But he was married to Diane Feinstein all the way back when she was mayor of San Francisco * And he also was a regent on at the University of California, which controls Los Alamos laboratories * He's known for his Blum Capital out of San Francisco is known for all the connections to the defense industry * And his C B R E CBRE real estate is also known for doing a lot of inside dealing in government * For instance CBRE got several contracts for disposing of assets Federal government assets as well as the post office * And old post offices as well * But probably most famously interactions with Lockheed are what he's probably the most famous for * And of course the university of california controls probably also Lawrence Livermore, I want to say and also Sandia * Not sure about that * But this would explain and tie together a lot of maybe the financial parts of our story with the nuclear laboratories, and the nuclear weapons development laboratories as well with the connection to Lockheed --- * [Day 138.4 Why Go To DC From Florida To Commit Suicide When You Are Happy? - YouTube](URL * OK this is Cameron Ross for Jess this is the 26 year old that shot himself at the front gate of the White House * And I think these stories are always worth follow-up * Everybody who's got a young son, including myself, wonders why someone goes to the White House gate and shoots himself * It just doesn't seem it doesn't seem like a normal activity for a 26 year old * And usually there's something else going on * Now, I had a chance to talk with his roommate that they talked about here * And this he mentions he likes to go to the beach, watch movies, play video games, just like every other normal 26 year old * So when his friend, Justin Ford, who I talked to on the phone * I just followed up and said, ""how about his job--were you a familiar with anything about his job?"" * And he had known that he was in this involved with this University of Florida child protection team * And then this is from the Department of Pediatrics, which is at the medical school there at the US University of Florida College of Medicine * And if you just read on their website, it's this multidisciplinary team for assessment services for children suspected of being abused or neglected * Well this really begs the question: ""what the heck?"" * And that sounds like enforcement to me that sounds like children and family services to me * So it almost sounds like a paralegal type enforcement * And again, here is the situation where there's a team of people there's a Task Force of people * So it just doesn't a seem that an independent group like this that's really tasked to do health, should be doing enforcement * Just something doesn't seem quite right about that * And seems like a mandate, not given to a medical college * It reminds me very much of the situation in Parkland, where we have 17 kids that are killed * And 39 messages to various police forces...and no activity * Yet we have the resources for the at the state level to go and create these multi Task Forces for this almost what could be considered a team to justify the--I'm not going to say snatching of children * But justified the taking of children away from their parents * So it just seems like more attention should be focused on these shooters * And again, or the opioid crisis, where you have a 170 kids a day dying of opiate overdose * Of course the final question is: why come all the way from Florida to Washington DC to commit suicide, if you weren't trying to get a message through to someone * {{ 911: maybe he was caught for pedophilia and they said go to the white house and shoot yourself or we'll shame you and your family in front of the whole world by outing you on the media. This would be forced / blackmailed 'propaganda of the deed', because it helps the left with gun grab narrative. Or maybe he was shot like you said by sniper trying to INFORM of pedophilia. }} --- * [Day 138.5 Krylova, Krylova, Come On Ova With Sova - YouTube](URL * This is Day 138.5 * And here's Rex Tillerson Secretary of State, sending a message to Kirsten Nielsen, who is the Secretary of the Department of DHS to Homeland Security, saying, ""hey mister Deripaska here that remember the derringer coming out of your paska, pointing at you. The guy with the boat the guy who--in Norway having NATO generals come out on his boat he hired this lobbyist named Waldman right in 2009. And you give Waldman enough money * And then you get a diplomatic passport"" * And here's Chris Steelee saying exactly that * That the ""general legal advice involving Mr. Deripaska a U.S. visa was a commercial transaction"" * So recent texts between Mr. Waldman and the Senator Mark Warner show a relationship between Mr. Waldman and Mr. Steelee * So here again, this series proves to be right on three different counts * We proved to be right on Fusion GPS * We were right on Deripaska * We were right on diplomatic passports * And you put organized crime figures with there when you put organized crime figures with diplomatic passports, you're going to get contraband * You are going to get contraband right * So it just stands to reason * So I won't cover the story now, but there's a story about seventy three containers falling off the coast of North Carolina, thirteen miles out on the Outer Banks--the Oregon Inlet they call it * One of them was completely full of radioactive waste * Now, you're seeing it bubble up * I think it was actually dumped into a drill area, which is what they do when they leach * And then if they want wait for the sulfuric acid to leach out * But I won't cover that story tonight * But again, there's another container story headed for Charleston from Norfolk * So these are things that just keep coming back in the news * Here's a new item here which is Gazprom Bank * This is the third biggest bank in Russia * And they're hiring 2x Senators on K Street ""bro"" from Louisiana I think or ""Bru"" however you say that * And then Trent Lott from Mississippi * And they're talking about hey get us a repeal of sanctions * Well that's perfectly if you want to do that and you are Hillary Clinton, but if your General Flynn * And that comes up the Russian ambassador brings that up then you end up going to jail for lying to the FBI * And now, finally we have Christopher Steele saying that the not only was the attack done by Russians in the DNC * But the agents Russian agents were within the democratic party structure itself * June 26 2016 inside he's--within the democratic party structure itself * Again, we're proven right * These are Russians * It's going to be Centreville * Gonna be within the Democratic Party themselves within the payment structure of the Democratic Party * Look to the server look to the Becerra server * Look to our good friend Natalia Sova --- * [Day 139.1 Tillerson Pops the First Oligarch on EB5, Dip Passport - YouTube](URL * This is Day 139 * And I love it when a puzzle comes together * This is just one example here's I talked about for Jess leading to a guy named Ronald Burgess who was running cyber for Trump in the transition * Could be a very pivotal guy that no one really had brought out in the news * And I compared him to Duke Nukem because he had spent so much time at Duke Energy, and he had spent so much time with nuclear fuel rods at GE and other places * Well John, our hero Macduff, linked Nukem to the actual Nukem company which develops yellowcake * So that led to a whole understanding of robotics and mining * And how Cameco, our hero from Shinkolobwe and--Dick Cheney in Barassos Territory there Cameco mining in Wyoming as well as Cameco in Africa was linked to NUKEM * And they bought NUKEM * And then that was then linked to you rank Oh which is our AQ KWAN * And our European companies where we've said all of our yellowcake Uranium * And all the reporting that John Solomon it's down at the hill * So I like it when the pieces come together so quickly like that * Same thing happened with ASTAR which was DHL quickly got linked to Diane Feinstein's husband Blum B L U M * And that he was quickly a link to James Comey Lockheed * And how good buddies they were in Federal contracting * And when I look at these as like puzzle pieces * And as they get put together it's easier because * Now, the next puzzle piece here is going to be easier because you're gonna be able to see the linkage between Comey Blum Feinstein and--DHL and ASTAR...still Federal contracts... and I like that * The same thing sort of happened over here with Burgess and the son Burgess not the father Ronald Burgess * But the father Ronald were just let a lot of taken links to Tony Shaffer and DIA * And my experiences down at the Navy Yard where Rod Wheeler is excuse me the National Harbor where Rod Wheeler is and G4S * It almost makes you think that there's a tight connection between DIA and G4S is sort of well * I don't want to say Drug Intelligence Agency * But let's just call it a Drug Intelligence Agency * If you remember way back when in May of last year I did a thing with Anthony Weiner about development alternatives Inc * And was that a play on AID like USAID * And because Anthony Weiner talking about development alternatives for a country to me means: well we can go yellowcake we can go white cake we've got a lot of development alternatives for you * I don't people remember that * So is that the play on dia--AID it's just another form of USAID, only using military means... military development methods if that makes any sense * So I think there's a lot to be said * And again, if it hadn't been for a woman looking me directly in the eye * And saying, ""you're never gonna shut down di A's drug business because we've got it spread over five countries,"" I wouldn't be so clear in my vision there * And then the one I'll go to though that I wanted to feature was this one the last one of yesterday which was Krylova Krylova come on ova with Sova * Sova being already here Natalia Sova is already here with the Awans on the cozy bears maybe maybe she's on the fancy bears * She's on some kind of hacking team * Sova is going to be on a hacking team right * Now, Krylova is at Duke we know there's a Krylova at Duke is that the Krylova that came on over we don't really know * But what I am saying is now, that the administration and the Congress are picking up on ways of getting this information * They have the ability to get this information and so what I did is I featured two stories yesterday one is now, this the testimony in the both the Senate and the house from Christopher Steele * And he's talking about how these hacking teams are built into the DNA of the of the DNC built into the DNC party structure itself * And what I'm gonna say I'm gonna take it to the next level * And say this is the ""cozy dukes"" which became the ""cozy bears"" * And this is ""fancy dukes"" which became the ""fancy bears"" * And this is all centered around Duke * And the kind of as the area for information operations for America * Charlotte and Duke--as the ideas come out of Duke they get baked in Charlotte * And then they get foisted on on America, through organizations like G4S and CNN... * So here here's what I mean Rex Tillerson is now, being the Secretary of State can say hey Mr. organized criminal from Russia Deripaska how is it that you got a diplomatic visa how did that happen just one letter boom there it is just much like the ten questions from Devin Nunes * Now, we can start asking all the different Russian organized criminals that became FBI informants * We can start asking Akmetshin * We can Veselnitskaya, Katsyv, Firtash--on down the line can I start asking every one of them-- * Our our bagel guy our a bagel boy our biscuit boy all those guys * So here's just a little bit me talking about that this is back in I think July sixth last year, talking about how do the crowd strike had organized these nine or ten Duke teams, that I believe they were organized at Duke * I think I said this way back then Andy McCabe now, we all know that he went to Duke--finally that came out * And this was the brainchild going back about 20 years ago * And I'm gonna say Krylova was involved * I'm not saying that Krylova that's currently at Duke was that person * But I think there was a Krylova involved at Duke on these hacking teams * Now, I don't know if it goes back 20 years or not * But here's me--this is why I've put so much emphasis on the Russians, remembering the Russians names * Here I am pouring cats into a sieve * {{CLIP}} you can see me pouring ket right * The reason why I focused so much on the mnemonic devices for the Russians is now, now mister excuse me * Now, Mr. Tillerson can go just ask each and every one of those Russians * Well how is it that you came about a diplomatic passport? * Remember we saw that letter and email in WikiLeaks ban talking about hey I need DIP passports for this I need DIP passports for that * Literally like you were saying I need--a lunch pass or something like it was just like candy--they were given these things out * He didn't have friends over in the Kingston passport printing office in Kingston, Virginia, it wouldn't be so easy * So I think there's another front that's opening up here's what I'm saying * The Secretary of State now, you can start drilling down in the EB-5s * This is why I've been focusing so much energy and effort on EB-5s and diplomatic passports, because they are a huge source of metadata * This can happen outside of this is gonna happen outside of the Congress * Can happen outside of the Senate * Outside of the house * Trump can publish this stuff anytime he wants * Just have Mr. Tillerson send a letter over to Kirstjen Neilsen (""cursed jen"")"

* Or we also know all like Deripaska did a was gotten in trouble with Nathan Rothschild for metal manipulation on metal markets manipulation * Marc Rich also got in a lot of trouble doing metal and markets manipulation * We know Marc Rich dabbled in oil embargoing, and illegal shipping of oil * We know all like Deripaska with SIFTNET is involved in that * So there's a lot of consistencies here where the FBI really kind of goes into business * They do become these get into a Strzok which is--special tactics--organized crime special tactics organized crime Russia's zone * That's what maybe it stands for * Maybe the Strzok shared drop boxes to just really kind of a continuation of Marc Rich, starting into probably about 1998, when--the BlackBerry kind kind of comes in in vogue, and it's really kind of had a good run of 20 years, basically prying off the Jewels--the encrust Jewels off these different--icons of russian wealth * And then selling them through different companies like Joule--a funny name funny coincidence there * Or different names like--Rus all for for Russian aluminum * SIFTNET met for whatever Rosneft for--another oil company * And just basically it's someone pocketing a thousand one hundred Jewels, shaking the bag, and then giving each kid in the court three or four or five of the different Jewels, and say, ""hey name the company whatever you want, John Podesta"" * [Podesta] says, ""well I've got a great name I'll name it Joule because I can't think of any other names"" * And that's really kind of the 40-year history of this * And it really does kind of tie everything together makes everything kind of easy to understand * Now is Rich the Israeli version of Rothschild? * We see the Rothschilds over and over again, with the Clintons * We see them over and over again, with the Riches--it doesn't really matter * I don't think is Marc Rich alive or dead, probably doesn't really matter * I thought that was me and everyone was chasing me and trying to kill me for stealing all their wealth, I'd just fake my death * And I'd go away * If I was the son and my name was Seth, I'd probably just do the same thing as well * I probably not show up a lot at the DNC I'd probably be only there long enough to play out some kind of narrative and then and then take a hike and take my Resources for the Future * We don't know any of those things yet * We do know that the people that are involved in this investigation like Laufhman are leaving as fast as possible * And we do know that the people like Gertler who have been intermediaries for ---storing this wealth, are having their wealth seized by this over seas foreign investment council * So they're--liquidating here as fast as they can * Gertler's just been the first one * And guys like loud men are like hey I'm out of here if you want me to try to seriously do a Russian investigation, no one's gonna think--we're being serious, because there's different people out on YouTube making videos, saying exactly what the solution is * And I'm supposed to sit here in the DOJ and look like a dummy * So a lot of stuff's coming together here * The Nathan Rothschild are interesting connections and more is going to start coming out * Now especially like guys like Paul Manafort Paul Manafort * if you want to look at his career with Oleg Deripaska, goes back from like 2005 to 2009 * Actually I think all the way through through now I think Oleg Deripaska * So if you look at the indictment against Paul Manafort, you're gonna say, ""well why didn't you indict Oleg Deripaska?"" * And they're gonna try to make Oleg Deripaska not look like the best--a buddy and friend for the last 20 years of Andy McCabe * They're gonna be very very disappointed * There's just nowhere you can turn where you look at Andrew McCabe's career and you don't find Oleg Deripaska * Same thing with Paul Manafort at the end * And which in turn means wherever you're going to find them, you're going to find Podesta * So again, all the throwing of all the throwing of bricks at Trump, just have this kind of effect of taking bricks out of their own structure that's defending them and causing a collapse of their own structure --- * [Day 113.4.

I want you to fill out this resume"" * You know Imran's got the resume all set up for let's say Jackson Heights New York * We're gonna get you--started with--the Bureau of Motor Vehicles * Or we're gonna get you a cab, or whatever * But the idea here is you have a guy your man in Havana--this if it was Craig Murray it would be our man in Tashkent getting our Saipov truckers * But here--in Virginia it's going to be Imran Awan * Now you're gonna have people at every usually located around the community colleges * And this is kind of like a go-to guy * They used to call it like an ombudsman or whatever * This is going to be like that Henry guy in Los Angeles * They're gonna have the control and know who to talk to if anybody acts up * This is the way unions have been organized forever Union Foreman's with precincts...so * This is why SEIU is the perfect way to do this * And what you're gonna find I know this is going to be shocking and people are going to not believe this, but the SEIU--there was a program with inside the DNC called *catalyst*m run by a guy named [Harold ICKES] I C K E S * And that program I believe is going to map directly into this Chantilly office of the DEA here, where this investigation was * And this is going to be operation Cassandra and the key here is you need to link all these offices together in some way * And you need to communicate with them * And then money needs to come from these areas from various activities * Let's say I bring people coming in from Pakistan, who don't really have any skills--can't drive a car whatever * I say well you're gonna go down to Lachine and you're gonna go down to Manitoba * And you're gonna be--those there's gonna be some girls there that are gonna have visitors every night * Your job is make sure those girls never get away and if they start to try to get away you got to stab them or hit them in the head or whatever make sure they don't leave * That's your job okay * So that's the low end and and--Omar starts with Rao in a apartment complex that's a real ratty like that * And they move their way up to kind of be more this kind of Ombudsman or local Foreman of the precinct and then they--move up the ladder to becoming a regional manager etc * That is operation that is operation Cassandra * How do you get the money now back to DNC? * Well you've got to go through the wires--you've got to go through communication * Now do you want to do that unencrypted you want to do that through something the NSA could easily see? * Or you want to have a softlayer, that looks like something else, that's kind of hidden * And then have all your communications kind of travel and the Navy--dark web the Navy Onion Router * The tor browser is The Onion Router--do you want that communications through the onion router? I think you do * Especially these kind of transactions right we're not talking about transactions that--you could talk to your grandmother about on the phone when you or when you go over for visits on Sunday * This is the onion router type transactions * So I believe that this SoftLayer was key in enabling the program from the DNC point of view is going to be known as the catalyst program * The program from the meetup spots if you will it's going to be the local union office--the SEIU office * The place where you intake people that are trying to get new jobs...and I believe that communication is going to be between these SEIU offices and the Hillary for America * Now I believe the main hub of activity in Washington DC is going to be the kind of--if you need a car or garbage truck driven on a train in front of a bunch of Congressional Congressmen you call--SEIU 32bj-- * So each one of these also has kind of a dirty tricks unit as well * Unions have been doing this forever * But SEIU is really the--the dirtiest of the unions * So I know that's all very complicated but you have to have a communications layer * It's better to have a softlayer where it doesn't show all these IP addresses that are easily seen * It's better than you go underneath you use that Onion Router you use that Navy Onion Router * And you have a secure form of communications that people don't see * I don't think they fooled NSA though * I think NSA has the communications and they have the emails * And so if you scroll down here * Oh by the way I saw Joshua Utretsky * Josh Utretsky made a comment here if you don't remember him he's the guy who was took over for brief time at DNC for Bernie Sanders * So and I asked him, ""hey Josh how are we doing on finding out if there was communications on the hour between the DNC and Hillary for America?"" * How are we doing on that did you ever find out if there was any NGP van and information going from back and forth * And he hasn't answered me yet he hasn't answered me yet --- * [Day 114.3 Awan Spy Ring in Congress To a Drug Ring in Congress - YouTube](URL * This is Day 114 this is part three * We're gonna go from a spy ring in Congress to a drug ring in Congress * And I know nobody wants to hear that * But we are going from a spy ring in Congress to a drug ring in Congress * I had said before that there was a theft ring to enable that * No one believed me until the operation Cassandra stuff came out * Again, I'm gonna say that that is just a vehicle no pun intended to the drug ring in Congress * That's the big news here * So well do spy ring first * This article came out in The New York Times * Just a laughable article of just someone really trying to be a spy novel writer * It's a very simple story * The Russian here is all like Deripaska * The intermediary in in Germany is Inna Kirsch * And the the buyers here are the CIA, to basically have a cover story for how did we get these cyber weapons into the hands of the Awans * And I also believe the Russians that are in the cozy bears and the fancy bears * These tools leave signatures * You then have to explain how did that happen? * How did the Awans have this tool in Grand Rapids Michigan, to hack into Trump hotel? * How did that happen? They left a signature somebody had to give them that weapon how did they get a million-dollar weapon from the NSA here * This is where I got squared off on by one overanxious cop here, when I was trying to take a picture of the parking lot on Sunday at NSA in Fort Meade * I went 12 other cops are standing around me * I was a real threat with my cell phone * But anyway, this has to be explained * How did these people in Centreville how do these Russians and Centreville get these cyber weapons that we're leaving hacks * You have to explain it * And you've got to go to this New York Times and whoever your favorite writer is * I feel bad for Matt Rosenberg, because I'm sure he thinks he's writing a story that's true * {{ 911: Pay attention to winking roses or words meaning rose like rus ros roz gul or gulen }} * One other thing that comes up in this story is also that the NSA gave out 10 codes through their twitter account * Again, I say everybody laughed at me when I said Freytag codes through the Twitter and spent time on that * Now the New York Times confirms that that is indeed how this happened 10 different times * 10 different codes went out for 10 different cyber weapons you can read it in the new York Times * Now let's move to the spire of the drug ring in Congress * I hate to say this, but the spy ring is just to enable the drug ring * A spy ring is just to make sure that your drug ring isn't gonna get caught * The vehicle theft ring was a vehicle for the drug ring * The moneymaker the big money maker the--the dog here--the elephant in the room is Operation Cassandra * This is 200 million dollars a month the spy ring is going to help you intimidate everybody in Congress * So nobody will stop this operation * That's the idea both in the Senate and the house * You can make money on pay-to-play as well that's also good that was more James Comey as an idea * But this was Andy's operation with The Awans just has to be * Now I believe Joe Rago was on this case he was on the case with the drugs coming through Pakistan from I believe Russia * I believe Russia initially was VERO pharmaceuticals was a big part of this * India also was a part of it with generics * But then I believe Pakistan came up to speed * And a lot of the Boule di Juggis that in that land there that that Imran's dad got was dedicated specifically to labs for doing their own value add on that opium product * So how this all shakes out over time--with all these other spy stories * The central operation here and they * Again, this is where you have the soft layer communication system with all the different SEIU branches...is is this operation Cassandra * This is the story * This is the drug ring in Congress * This isn't a drug ring just in Chantilly, Virginia with SoftLayer, with a few SEIU bad actors out there * This is a structural, Navy Mason, fake cop, really weird DEA license, with DEA licenses, hiring truckers that are coming in from other countries, that have worked these other ratlines overseas, to run drug franchises * I know how unbelievable that sounds * I give that whole idea the name ""Chinatown"" * They'll kind of going back to the British Empire when that British Empire would set up different Commissions in different towns for people * And that that was their job * They ran drugs in that town * And they were expected to pay a ~~Comey'ssion~~ {{ 911: rofl }} Commission to the Queen * It's the same exact idea these guys are given all the heraldry, and all the pomp and circumstances, to run fake police forces * Again, if I hadn't seen it for myself * If I hadn't been squared off on by three guys * And if Task Force hadn't been squared off on by three guys * We wouldn't say it existed * If I hadn't seen the Chief of Naval Operations in our lobby at 5:30 in the morning, I wouldn't be saying what I am now * This is what they are protecting * Joe Rago was right on top of the story * And this will be the story of our time of our time --- * [Day 114.4 Drug Ring in Congress - The Blackberry Twenty - YouTube](URL * It's day 114 and for over a year I've had Andre Carson in the middle of my channel art here * And I've had this article from Heather Kagel from Politico about the 20 burglaries as the key part of my channel * And the three committees here Intel, House DHS, and foreign affairs have been the three key committees I focused on * These 20 burglaries * And I still think that's the key to the whole not only spy ring in Congress * But not only that it explained the theft ring the car theft ring in Congress but it also explains the drug ring in Congress * And now we're seeing a lot of obfuscation and parallel construction to try to cover for this drug ring * But essentially if we still if we get the initial capitol police report for these 20 burglaries, and we find out which Congressmen are the 20 burglaries we'll have the answer to the test * Now we have some clues from the Daily Caller article, which talked about the server * And then the 45 different folks that have worked for the Awans * So we have some clues--we can play some guessing games, but it would be better just to come straight out and say which 20 there were * That's exactly what my lawsuit tries to do: get to the truth rather than all this kind of parallel construction we're seeing now * The three key people an article came out here about Keith Ellison from Minnesota meeting with Louis Farrakhan and two other democrats * And the two other democrats are gonna be Greg Meeks who has JFK Airport in his area and then Andre Carson that I just mentioned * And this is going to be the funnel of getting money back into the Congress to fund the drug ring operations * And this is an operation that's going to be putting operatives bringing operatives in from mainly Pakistan ISI trained operatives * And putting them around the United States, mainly here in Washington DC, but also in New York, and also keep port cities, where--and I and I say I still say those key port cities are the same 20 cities of the same 20 Blackberries * So these different people that have carried the blackberry * That you carry the BlackBerry for certain length of time then you give it off to the next guy--you don't carry it forever * But then you become part of the conspiracy * And this is what we've got going in in our house * Now daily caller named about 45 of these folks that had passwords... * Other reports have said there was 33 that worked directly for the Awans * And then there was 12 that they had illegal access to * So we could argue about that * But again, when you get the Capitol Police report all this goes away * And I've again, I've asked for this as a writ of mandamus from Judge Contreras in my trial here * And if we get that and we won't have to do this guess work okay * So moving along you'll see this top trending story about this guy named Jonathan Winer * He's at DOJ--he's quitting * He also magically came up with a Blumenthal memo from Christopher Steele at the same time Blumenthal did * But he's an attorney, so he's covered * He's also this APCO story with Uranium One * He's the three million dollars given to the government of Russia, but it's all covered in an attorney-client privilege * But he was also at the State Department he has a big opinion piece out now in The Washington Times...saying how did Devin Nunes is really coming after me, and this is so bad and * Now he's Middle East Institute we talked about the Institute's yesterday is kind of a way of laundering information * And then of course Libya Libya Libya and his background with the State Department * And then you're gonna see he was spending with APCO which is kind of a--a funnel * So you get these weird stories, like the Weird Tales of Jonathan Winer coming up with this memo at the same time that Sid Blumenthal is coming up with it * But guess what? I'm Victoria Nuland--I didn't get it from Sid Blumenthal * I got it from my attorney right * I got it from my attorney and John kerry is gonna say this thing same thing: I didn't mishandled classified information I got it from Victoria Nuland * We we have a totally cleansed memo we don't have that dirty memo from my good friend Sid Blumenthal * What I like to do is look a little deeper--had no pun intended here for the Charleston Harbor deepening project * And look to Congressman that it may have supported Imran Awan for these ports deals * Because this is a way that you can use the Federal money to get money into your district * And in turn, support your drugs and weapons trade for the Awan Contra type trade * I'm not saying Jim Clyburn is involved in that * But I look more to this kind of thing where a lot of money is being spent in a Congressional district * The more than I look to these kind of parallel constructions which I see is more to confuse the public, right? * So and here if you want to see it * Again, the Wall Street Journal is talking about these three DNC chairman and Keith Ellison is the key guy here that's--funneling the money * They throw a Louis Farrakhan in here to be a lightning rod, to make it a black-white issue * It has nothing to do with Muslim Brotherhood or black/white * It's about Hezbollah Hezbollah funding a drug ring in Congress--no no more complicated than that * So you're gonna get see people like this Michael Kortan--he also resigned * I'm gonna say cheese--it's all these people at FBI resigning * All these people are in the Strzok page memos * But what really Michael Kortan did was he was a key organizer for SEIU, and he was a key representative of the Postal Workers Union * And again, you need hands and feet in all these different areas wherever your ports are you gonna need hands and feet * You could use Amazon people for private * Or you can use public SEIU employees if they're postal workers * &gt;&gt;&gt;CONT"

Let's not get into a big argument over--synthetic aperture radar * You're gonna bring in we're gonna bring in the satellite data * You're also going to bring cell phone data * Location data * You're gonna bring in human human data like from your G4S got gangs for security * You're gonna bring in the human * GEOINT * And sig int sig into signal Intelligence * That's coming from the phones you bring it all together and basically with all that you could create a movie, just like I'm making * Now you have your sky * So you can geolocate me on a map you have the video of well you have the signal that I'm generating right now from my phone to watch me over time * So you have a time series * And then you have other databases that can combine * So if you were directing a team at targets, they could basically watch a movie and have the complete dossier moving with you all the time * And that's it what I think the NADRA application is exactly * And I think in order to do that NADrA application, that's why it combines all these things * So uranium was a perfect excuse to pay for the application * But it's really going to be used for political military domination of different countries all over the world * They're gonna resell this all over the world * We're gonna write different interfaces in Pakistan for different countries Pakistan is going to be the the funnel for all the Middle East and Africa small island nations and * So far they're gonna get a lot of resale business here * So that's what I believe it is * Now how do you bring all these people in under a passport program? * Well I think the first hundred thousand come in under this MAVNI program * The military vital assets needed in case of an insurrection * Which they're gonna say in case of ""something else"", but in case of an insurrection * It's really a population control thing * And when you think about it a general wants to win * And Generals win by having plans * And if you don't have a plan for your own * (capital down there), * If you don't have a plan to put your own population down, that's like a general that lets his flag be captured * That's F for general right * So anyway, I believe that the program had a lot of criticism, bringing a lot of people that have been trained in Intelligence but had terrorist backgrounds * They didn't even know where 6,000 of the MAVNI 100,000 are * So I think the program still exists, but I think they cut back on it * Again, I might be saying more than I know here, but people will research this * And then I think you have to have a capability to start printing passports * Here again, if you give people the ability to print passports especially diplomatic passports, you open up the possibility that they do diplomatic containers * I can take somebody's name, falsify a passport, and I'm good to go * I don't need to be a diplomat and I believe the diplomatic passports are made up there where I said TISCOMM * TISCOMM's at the bottom of the hill--the Coast Guard just come in Kingstowne where Laura Everly lives * The top of the hill is the CIA * And what happens there is all these different printers and IT equipment comes back there from all over the world * For printing passports, among other things * But I think also diplomatic passports * So if you are forging diplomatic passports for this MAVNI program to bring people in, you could test your reader there up on the hill, near top Gulf * And I soon as I walk by top Gulf, I said all this is a fake * So I came in to get my driver, but it's shaped like a passport printer * So anyway that's what I believe. We'll see * But there's a State Department unit up * There they do fix passport printers up there * And right behind the Walmart * And I walked right by it, and when I walked by it I said, ""oh no this there's something going on here."" * And I think the MAVNI passports are printed there * So the key point... * {{ G talks to guitar player, Jack Peoples }} * {{ peoples.com -- see video for infomration.

Fusion GPS Behavior - 5K Blank Pages To Congress, - YouTube](URL * Day 37 these lawsuits these three lawsuits are coming together faster than I had originally thought * I was in the studio yesterday for OAN Network and that story is now running every half an hour * Emerald Robinson here is the one of the hosts and achors news reporter--she does it all * Moore Heinz is the bureau chief so I want to say thank you to him * That should be running every half-hour * {{ 911: it cannot be found on the internet. Isn't that curious (it's not) OANN has had an issue with AWAN stories before^^[[1]](URL }} * Now and what I want to do here is just kind of a news update of all three lawsuits DNC Podesta group and also Fusion GPS * Podesta group and then also the FBI lawsuit--they're coming together faster than we could have ever imagined * The Uranium One I mean just just some key things that people might be wondering why are you sending out this stuff * Here's a photographer that wants to do a photo shoot with Steve Bannon and myself * We're gonna see if that can happen * I think when the one story breaks for real, big-time * And Breitbart really starts covering it * And then Bannon steps in and starts really kind of hammering it * That's when it's time to do photo shoots...like that * But he's check this guy out Peter Duke * He does a lot of really cool any Breitbart portraiture...that he takes the kind of Fusion GPS smears that they do against people that are kind of in all me and he makes you look better than you do * To counterpoise against the smears of the Fusion GPS type stuff * So anyway we talked a lot this morning * Now people are talking about these different hacks that the FBI has done, and I believe Fusion GPS is also going to be part of this * And one of the things I wanted to talk about was these generals in Florida * This one general named Brady who was a head of the nuclear weapons in Europe gets hacked doesn't know how it happened * In order to hack these guys you have to have some skills--here's Hugh's head of the DIA this is Mike Flynn's job before * Again, he gets hacked nobody knows how that happens here's the Washington Examiner talking about 80 people that were interviewed that gotten hacked * This is the kind of the Samantha Power type hacking * And only two people were informed * So the FBI let them go ahead and keep hacking them * So here again, this is gonna be the just like Uranium One was a ten year or 14 years sting, this is gonna be another *color-of-law* surveillance operations and--hey we we were we needed to catch the foreign adversary here * So we hacked your email for ten years and didn't tell you about it, because you would have changed your behavior if that would have been the case * So here's another article where different generals are hacked * This is the part I said was coming in this story and * Again, will also come out with metadata * But all these generals down here in Florida and in DC are being hacked here * So we'll get to that story as it develops * But it's going to be already in the lawsuit and I mentioned to people already in the lawsuit I mentioned this Centreville Russian retreat * I don't know if you remember but they secretly whisked everybody out of the country the first of the year * So when everybody's partying from watching football, they whisked them all out * They left this place * But that's where all the Russians that's where a little spy nest was * We're gonna get more to that the and I talked about--the special agent Pettijohn, when I had said, ""hey this the nuclear operations going through Charleston"" * The special agent Pentagon for the FBI that kind of did the parallel construction on me * He was representing or he has an expert in this NNSA which is this nuclear fuel tracking this nuclear fuel that powers the Navy * So you're gonna see here how that kind of a layers stack up * You're gonna see the FBI is providing the transport along with the Navy to allow these ships to go back and forth untouched uninspected * The people that put the cargo on top are gonna be the Awans with their logistics... * And then of course you're gonna have the Uzbek truckers that they--the actual hands and feet of the operation * They're going to be Uzbek truckers or the MS-13 guys working on the docks * So I just all three the 3 lawsuits are separate right now in order to keep it so the judge doesn't, judges don't think that I'm on a fishing expedition * I want to prove very specific points within each kind sub lawsuit * And then we'll move to moving together if the evidence merits * So the other one is Bruce Lindsay * Did Bruce Lindsey start Tenex? * The companies involved in Uranium One are called TENEX T E N E X and then TENAM 10am * Now you may know TENEO which was TENEO was the company that Doug Band wrote the famous 12 page letter that Charles Ortel always refers to * That basically says we conduct high treason and print passports and do all sorts of things--with reckless abandon * And the and you'll see that * Now did Bruce Lindsay the same lawyers same Clinton Foundation lawyers start Tenex? * Now as TENEX for the exporting of your of uranium from the Soviet Union to different oligarchs in Ukraine, Pakistan, India, UAE, all these developing countries? * That's the question that we need to know * He was in Washington a long long time before Bill Clinton never got to Washington about ten years before * So he also has an address as you can see here and well if you in in Little Rock as well * So the connection between GH WB and Bill Clinton is becoming a little bit more obvious maybe through this he's also the guy with the with the thumb drive with the 650,000 emails and with Huma the Huma server * Now is he going to be the same guy with Awan server? That's what remains to be seen we don't know * So I talk a lot about the developments--the big news is obviously Fusion GPS with these payments to these journalists--that's the big news that's hitting this the story now * And this shows and then also hiding 112 emails and so that is not looked on well by the court * It looks like you lied and you withheld information from the Congress of the United States * Going lie to Congress willing to lie probably just about anybody * So anyway so that's not gonna look good * Let's just see if we get any hits here on Fusion GPS and 112 just to see if that's becoming internet meme yet * And there we go 112 emails transactions that didn't go into the probe * That was a couple of days ago * And I think you're seeing a lot of traffic now with Glenn Simpson, asking (there's my post) ""hey what's going on here with 112 emails?"" * So this is not going away * This will be presented--I need to update the lawsuit for the FBI obviously * I need to put a Update Podesta Fusion GPS lawsuit now obviously * Because they're paying journalists and they're withholding information from Congress and giving 5,000 blank pages * I tend to remember things in 3...so I can say I'm in threes * 5000 blank pages 112 hidden transactions and also payments to three journalists * So I go from five thousand to twelve eleven hundred and twelve to three-- * And that's how I remember it so it just comes out easily * And then I've got to update the the same FBI lawsuit * Because FBI is also paying Fusion GPS for the PP dossier you're gonna find out that's for spying... * So that's the update for this morning and I'll hit the streets now in DC --- * [Day 37.2. Geolocation For Dred Scott Used Dogs, How Are We Different Now? - YouTube](URL * Day 37 this is part two here in front of the Supreme Court * I wanted to talk about Dred Scott * If you're not familiar with the Dred Scott case--he's a slave in 1857, I think it was before that the case was tried in 1857 and decided on * And he basically said I want to go over this line here to Maryland * I want to get out of here get out of DC and go over to Maryland the Free State it wasn't it was actually Missouri at the time * But the idea that I'm just walking from one side of a border to another * And he's basically that's how a lot of slaves got their freedom * Just by--going over the border and the court said well when you went over the border * You really didn't become a citizen, because you were black * And you weren't a citizen you were slave * So you didn't gain any rights, when you did this when you walked over on this side, you didn't gain any rights therefore slave catchers could come catch you and locate you and yank you back * Sort of like geo-locating you * They would follow you they follow you with dogs * They follow you at the technologies of the day * A geolocate you geolocate you wherever you were on this side of the border and drag you back * Geo-locating that's very simple * Well the Supreme Court upheld that decision probably the worst decision ever in the Supreme Court's history * And this group over here passes the 14th amendment that moots this ruling * So you can have a branch of government fix another branch of governments worst decision * That is possible. There is precedent there * Now ask this question: if you have an agency a rogue agency, in--let's just call it FBI--in this case using satellite technology, satellite technology, to track you, and geolocate you using cell phone technology (let's just say this is a cell phone), using cell phone technology to geolocate you, using human Intelligence to geolocate you, [and] fusing it all together into an application like NADRA, which these folks over here are going to be working on when we find that out...So is that also not a way of geo-locating you? * And is that information available? * Well yes it is available, because it happened to me * I was there * And the not only that this agency that did the geolocation and fusing of this information at DISA in in Virginia ***admits they did it*** * JTTF, South Carolina admits they did it, and they admit they were geolocating me way before the events of me trying to go out and meet that informant later that night * So I asked this: if you are allowing a Federal enforcement branch to geolocating you, aren't you basically doing the same thing as Dred Scott, just following the person everywhere-- * ...The only thing that's different is instead of using dogs, you're using satellites * You're still geolocating instead of sense of smell of the dog the sense of sight for the satellite okay * ***So geolocation though in a way makes us all Dred Scott*** * Because it applies to every citizen in the United States Snowden proved that they're gonna collect it all in terms of the cellphone (that's gonna represent the cellphone) * I'm gonna prove that they're collecting it all in terms of NGA and DISA, and they're bringing it all together in DISA * So in that sense we're really all Dred Scott * The only difference between us and Dread Scott is we have no way of going over the border to get our rights back * There's nowhere we can go--there's no way out * So since this lawsuit is more important than Dred Scott * Because it's really fighting for the fundamental rights of life liberty pursuit of happiness and own property for every individual in the United States * We're all in this together * We're all Dred Scott * Now what remedies are available? * This Court is not going to do it * It has to be brought here (SC) * These folks have to fix it! --- * [Day 37.3.

We need to have the ability to follow everyone"" * Well I would say that there's the interest of the people who have done nothing wrong * That are just journalists exercising their First Amendment right or their even just regular people expecting and celebrating their right to gather to converse free speech right * And there's the GPS technology that we have, that Imran has * So if someone does commit a crime against society we can give them a GPS * So we have a way of delineating between people who commit crimes and those that don't * They can even make the GPS look like it's kind of a cool wristwatch * Doesn't have to be a big ugly ankle bracelet anymore * It can be kind of a fashion statement * So this is where I'm saying collecting at all and then moving terabytes overseas to Pakistan * Look at the history * Look at the record of DHS * They put a spy ring in our Congress * Paying them all $160,000 a year * Moving hundreds of transactions to Pakistan, terabytes of data to Pakistan * And I believe and I'll show that they're actually writing instead of using that technology to stop terrorism, they're actually using it to attack people in the United States, to target people that disagree with the government's position on a whole host of constitutional issues * Journalists especially * But civil rights groups as well * And the performance here has never been clearer * The contrasts have never been clearer * ***That that people that we should be watching that have ties to LET SPS different terrorist groups in Pakistan are the one actually getting the data*** * ***They're actually getting the transcripts of our secret testimony in our most sensitive committees, where the American people are not*** * ***The application that I'm going to show that they're writing for DHS is going to be a satellite-based application to take away exactly the right side just spoke about*** * ***So the argument that the government needs this to fight terrorism is specious*** * ***It's specious, because their performance and their behaviors shown exactly the opposite*** * So the big goal here is not just to get the spy ring out of Congress * It's not just to amend the Fourth Amendment, to make give it some teeth, to update it, to talk about geolocation in all of its forms is illegal * If you want to track somebody * If you want a geolocate somebody, if you want to make a Dred Scott situation you give them an ankle bracelet * And that way everyone knows who's being tracked, and who isn't being tracked * And it can be done in a very subtle way where no one will know that person is being tracked * So that's my a very fundamental long-term goal is to restore the fundamental rights that the founders intended by amending the Fourth Amendment to make clear * Or the court could just issue a ruling that clearly defines that * That what the founders meant was by unreasonable search and seizure was that you would not be tracked * So we wouldn't have to fight case law--with Carmichael or excuse me Carpenter...we would have to fight these court cases and lower courts and then have to fight it out in the Supreme Court * In the Carmichael case excuse me the Carpenter case they could just rule that the founders intended that until you do something wrong, you don't lose your fundamental rights * You don't lose your fundamental rights by default * And then win them back by exception by suing to get them back like I'm having to do * So I don't wear an ankle bracelets by the way * But and I haven't done anything wrong * But they sure but I certainly have been falsely imprisoned longer than all the Awans in the spy ring have served up until this time * As a matter of fact my mugshots been published when I was a free an innocent man * Did nothing wrong * And Imran still has not * {{ 911: recap for others: G was put in jail in Zanesville, OH for sleeping in his parked car--as a result of parallel construction based harassment--related to someone on his channel reporting a credible dirty bomb threat off the port of charleston.

Do You Think Russian HEU Could Have Been Diverted To Ukraine For Oligarchs To Profit? - YouTube](URL * This is Day 37 part 4 back at the Department of Energy, because I wanted to talk a little bit about *modus operandi* with this Uranium One deal * One of the ways of doing a fraud is putting in a small request, let's say for a quarter million kilograms of uranium, like transportation logistics did in 2008 Mark Lambert * And then later on increasing it, maybe through actually increasing it, or actually falsifying the paperwork to thirty two million * Which is a hundred twenty eight fold increase * We don't know * But the other way to do it is to create a corporation sort of that is a mirror corporation that uses the same paperwork and just kind of rides underneath the original legit * So you have the legitimate that people can see * You have the illegitimate one that people can't * This case it may be EDLOW E D L O W. * EDLOW Trucking is formed by Fiske the founder right about the same time that Transport Logistics is formed * Now the interesting thing about Edlow is they have about half along the way of what Transport Logistics does * And it's very easy to take the front page of one agreement and clip it to the back page of another * You're in Russia you're not in an online system and you probably could get away with that * You might even be able to get away with that if you knew who the people were at the ports okay * So there's two things to look at one is Edlow * You could enter into an agreement with a K Street lobbyist to say, ""Ok well we'll ship our share our partnership will be Edlow and then the other partnership will be Transport Logistics okay * So let's look at the evidence because this this what I'm saying here comes from evidence * Looking at the Nuclear Regulatory Commissions, which is a part of the Department of Energy, paperwork * Actually showing the paperwork and publishing the paperwork * Now the only other person that's produced any paperwork as far as Saipov--the guy who ran people down on the sidewalk in Chelsea--*is me* * I put out ~~cyclops v~~ Saipov's 5 trucking companies almost at the almost simultaneously as soon as you ran the people over * He had one in Florida. He had one two in Ohio one in Illinois. And I believe one in Minnesota * Could be he had 23 * But Trump said the next day he was the first person in in a chain migration of 23 different people * Now if you use EB-5 visas which only require you to invest a half a million dollars in the United States, Saipov could have created 23 different trucking companies, and taken a half interest in each company or some interest in each company that he created, bringing in people * Now if you look at the facts, what it looks like, is up until the ~~Cepheus~~ CFIUS decision is approved in 2010, they basically just took the operation the Uzbeki truckers that were in Uzbekistan (between Kazakhstan and Pakistan), which were hired, I believe, by the Punjabi police, and they just moved them to the United States * (This is the Department of Transportation) * They just got everybody visas--EB-5s that the people that were doing it over here in Europe up to 2010, before Paul Manafort works with Yanukovych in Ukraine, before he comes into power * They just move it over here * To get everybody EB-5 visa Dept of truck Department of Transportation commercial driver's license maybe export licenses and maybe not we don't know * If [it] was me I would just use the existing licenses I already had from mark Lambert at transportation logistics * So again, this very evidence based very document based * So the only person up until this point outside of all the rhetoric is myself * Now I do believe in rhetoric as well, because you can reason through these situations * If let's say this is pre 2010: if you're willing to here after 2010 the CFIUS decision--if you're willing to take 20% of US uranium and ship it all over the world through Urenco and other companies, would you be willing to take Russian highly-enriched uranium, and just send it to the Ukraine? * Would you be willing to send it to Pakistan, UAE, India, other developing programs? * If you're willing to send 20% of our uranium overseas, how about somebody else's uranium just diverting it for your own profit? * I think that is reasonable that that person might engage in both of those activities * You engaged in this activity which is far more egregious selling 20% of US uranium * Why wouldn't you divert somebody else's uranium? * Remember who's driving this uranium over there? * It's the Uzbeki truckers--these are terrorists * Uzbeki truckers truckers, not Americans, over there driving that uranium around --- * [Day 37.5.

Natalia? - YouTube](URL * This is Day two of the Awan trial and more with the Grafenstine interrogatories * I'll just say one thing before the Grafenstine is appointed here by Nancy Pelosi on June 30th 2010, an interesting event happens about two months earlier * And that is this person that I was talking about yesterday this Rosatom guy this this executive that works with the Russian company that made this deal for 20% of the US uranium * Guy named Mikerin in he gets a visa meaning this program is getting formalized we McCarran is bribing and I starts in 2009 he starts bribing this trucking company called transportation logistics the I won't go into the details right * Now but it's gonna be important remember that the uranium traffic on the ships and in the American ports especially is why you need the Congress unique Congressmen to buy off on the control of the port's by the UAE in order to affect this ratline * Because in the ratline you're not going to just ship the uranium * The uranium is going to be a cover * What you're gonna be shipping then is also dark weapons and drugs * The dark weapons are depleted uranium weapons a lot of the uranium that's supposed to be going to waste facilities is actually going into the construction of weapons in Pakistan * That's this is the key ratline * This story still has not come out yet * But this is the key story here that a lot of the waste uranium is actually going to depleted uranium weapons manufacture * And in order to put that together you need US ports * Now I'm not saying this leads directly to graph instance hiring * But I'm just putting it out there putting this in perspective * Because once you have these ships going coming and going you have a national security reason for them coming and going just like Awan-Contra, Iran-Contra * Now I can put the drugs in, now I can put the weapons in * It's exactly the same as Iran-Contra only this is Awan contract okay * So how does it all come together once this deal gets put together in July of 2011 you Natalia Sova is hired by Congressman Detsch down here in Florida * She only works there seven months I believe that's in order to work with the people in Ukraine she speaks Ukrainian and Russian, but she's working the Russia end of this if you will * And I also believe there's gonna be a Ukrainian facility that's gonna end up doing a lot of reprocessing and uranium as well on the Russian border * So she's only hired for seven months to really kind of nail down the Russia side of this * I also believe that there's gonna be pharmaceuticals made in Russia * That are gonna be used later on * Obviously there that's the lucrative business that Imran Awan and his father want to be a part of * I think what happens is the Russians have that business until 2000, right around now * Right around 2011 where when it switches over here from Natalia Sova and they pick up that business * We'll see we'll see what the facts are * October 2011 - one year later Rao Abbas is hired * Again, any time you have a ratline you must infiltrate the intercept capability you must infiltrate DHS you must infiltrate to have an early warning system you need to infiltrate the Coast Guard * Need to infiltrate the Navy for the for the long haul * You need to infiltrate Customs and Border Protection for when it gets cleared and customs * This is gonna be exactly why in Charleston we go through those three layers and when I get those five phone calls * Those are gonna be exactly the same folks that need to be infiltrated with programming teams * Rao Abbas I think is working at a little bit higher level * He may be running phones around * We still don't know anything about Rao Abbas * But would not Grafenstine know Rao Abbas? * It's the first question is-- after I asked her do-- a marauder want do-- RAO Speedwagon Abbas do-- him * I believe Haseeb Rana on the way they've characterized him as the worker bee that had to do all the work * I think that's correct * Maybe he ends up being the runner maybe Jamal ends up being the runner * But I do now believe that Rao Abbas is spending a lot of time every year in Pakistan * His social profile shows that he might be spending almost nine months a year in Pakistan, working with the programming teams infiltrating DHS * So I won't go into the different companies that are created for Natalia Sova * But one of them is easy car buying easy car buying in Annandale * I believe she lives at the Annandale address * And that's kind of her center of operations * She's going to have programmers there but those programmers are going to be more Ukrainian and Russian programmers * So to handle that end of the programming * So I'll fast forward here but again, Grafenstine does Grafenstine know Haseeb Rana? * Did was Grafenstine aware of this order for the CDW order? * Did she look at any of the other orders, that were made? * Does she know what happened to these phones as these orders are being made? * As Haseeb Rana is taking these orders * I don't believe the first order was in 2016 they're gonna obviously be going all the way back to when Rao Abbas is there in 2012 if not before * So we'll have to see what she knew when she knew it * One of the things I wanted to introduce was the House Committee on administration * Again, here just like we did with the House Armed Services Committee drilling drilling one level down now on some of the people that are a part of this committee * And the important part here is I'll publish this timeline * The important part here is believe the Congressman's name is Greg from Mississippi * And then this is going to be a committee of about 11 * Zoe Lofgren here this guy from Pennsylvania one here and * Now we can start commenting * Hey when you guessfound out about the 150 CDW orders going to the house the Hawkshead house by Imran Awan--when did you meet? * What date did you meet? * When did you make the recommendation to call Grafenstine over here at the House Inspector General? * When did you do that? * They should at least be able to tell us that what day the meeting was * If you're gonna tell the Washington Post which is basically a cover up organization * And Shawn BoBerg's a little more than a spy for Mirando and Wasserman over at the attorney general's office, you have to at least tell us what they had the meeting and what your recommendation was * When did you recommend the house inspector general come in and look at this? * We also talked about the lawsuit that I intend on filing * How it's different from the Jared Beck lawsuit * How it's more of a RICO lawsuit * How it's more of a Computer Fraud and Abuse Act * How it's more of an espionage act * How it's not just fraud and how this investigation didn't know anything this lawsuit didn't know anything at all about via wants they didn't know anything at all about the credit union fraud the CDW fraud the john wilkes phone booth the logins from the inspector general report * None of this stuff was available to to Jared back when he amended it * He didn't know anything about the Act Blues phishing attacks at DNC he didn't link the DNC to the Awans * So a lot of stuff wasn't in this lawsuit that will be in mind okay * Again, let's see pictures of Abid Awan to follow up on this and * Again, miss Graphenstine have you ever met Abid Awan? * You've talked about hacking * You've talked about doing assessments * You've talked about disaster recovery plans * You talked about mirrored servers * Do you realize mirrored servers are the perfect way for an organization to get everything? * Constantly being updated * Is is there a mirrored server process logging in on every hour to mirror the two BlackBerry servers is that what's what what's happening in the Congress? * Let's be honest let's let's come out and talk about it * The other interesting thing is right as right as the investigation is being handed over by Grafentine to FBI in October, Grafenstine writes this article about cyber hacking * And here's the first hundred things the president needs to do about cyber hacking * She thinks Hillary's gonna win at this point * But she makes no mention whatsoever she does put shipping containers in this article interestingly enough on the hill * She does and then she also has a programming team and talks programming teams overseas * So it was very interesting choice of pictures * But did what when did you write the cyber-hacking article for the hill miss Grafenstine * Did you write it after or before you dropped the case * And gave the case over to the FBI? * Why wouldn't you write about this case a case that she had just got done researching for seven months * So that's gonna be a key question is * Let's look at all the writing that Graphenstine has done over the period of time the Awans have been there and see why isn't she writing about the Awans in the Awan hacking if she's so close to it * She had just finished handing over the investigation she'd just finished handing over the investigation to the FBI * Why wouldn't you write about that on October the 15th before the election --- * [Awan Trial Day 2.2. Naming Plaintiffs and Defendants - YouTube](URL * This is Day two of the Awan trial this is the second video had a little trouble uploading my second video from this morning * So this is going to be number two and I'll just have to say it verbally * We're going to draw a timeline out for Miss Grafenstine either as a defendant or as a witness * I believe at this point we have enough evidence to name her as a defendant for negligence * Now I'm not saying she did anything deliberately wrong * But I am saying she's negligent because we had four separate reports available, that she must come forward with, if she thinks this house is on fire * Again, I understand that there was a crime committed over here with bank fraud * Three hundred thousand dollars from the Federal Credit Union was transferred to Pakistan * That's one small crime but what we have here is a bigger problem the house is still on fire * Rao Abbas still has access Rao Abbas still has access to that house and those house Congressional servers * And we don't know all the information that already has been transferred to Pakistan * So we have the suspicious activity reports that we need to find out about * We have the illegal logins that we need to find out about * We have the police report for the John Wilkes phone booth over here in the Rayburn office * We've got the CDW reports that we need to find out about plus we need to find out about all of the police reports especially criminal police reports of Imran Awan * All those things an auditor would look at that if there was suspicious activity they would look for it if somebody had declared bankruptcy they would look if somebody had multiple homes if they were using multiple names * All the things we've done in our investigation would certainly be required for somebody who's worked twenty years as the house is inspector general * So what we are gonna do is we're gonna name 435 plaintiffs * I'm gonna just say myself and 435 other john and jane doe's to be named later * I can joinder those names in later * And we're gonna name the CAO and the people at the house inspector general as the defendants in the alternative for negligence * And then we're going to charge fraud and malfeasance for Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and Imran Awan, where we certainly have standing because I was a Bernie supporter * Now there are going to be some people that may not have given to Bernie * So you won't have standing in that case * So we'll have to be careful how we choose the john doe's and jane doe's going forward as we add those in * But we don't need to worry about that right * Now we just need to make a statement a cause of action * We need to make a statement in our complaint there's a cause of action here * There was malfeasance on the part of Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, the DNC, Imran Awan, the IT staff that he assembled, Rao Abbas, Haseeb Rana, Hina Alvi * And then we also have to name in the alternative the people at CAO * The people at the House Committee on administration * And all the people at the house inspector general's office as well, because there was just a orgy of evidence * And you must use that your responsibility when you take the government oath to protect the Constitution and protect the United States of America * That's your first responsibility * They have power of equity we're not suing for damages * We're not suing for we want money because they are indemnified as government employees * But what we are saying is specific performance * We want the specific performance of being honest publishing all those reports * The five the reports that I talked about and letting the American people have the right to know * So they can make an intelligent damage assessment * The 435 representatives of course will be on the witness list * We'll have a lot of people on the witness list * Hopefully we won't have to depose all of them but we certainly have to depose Grafenstine * We certainly have to depose all the conspirators for the fraud and malfeasance part of this okay * So that's the plan going forward * Don't worry about not being named as a John Doe or Jane Doe initially * Just make sure you sent a letter to your representative, to make sure you have standing * Send a letter about the iConstituent software * And you'll be good to go --- * [Awan Trial Day 3.1. Outline of Complaint Against DWS and Awan Spy Ring in Congress - YouTube](URL * Ok Day three of th Awan trial we're moving from pretrial discovery open source documents * Now to writing the complaint here's an outline * I think this is important first to show the outline so that people can understand the key points of the complaint, rather than just producing the final complaint * First thing I want to show is how different this is from the Jared Beck lawsuit * That's the key thing * They had no knowledge of via wands at all when they wrote their complaint a year ago * And they did not talk about the legislative process at all * So this is the key difference * Mine is mainly concerned with the legislative process * And then a little a bit about the election process * So 0.1 the Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, Imran Awan and Abid Awan, Hina Alvi, Rao Abbas and ~~sassy piranha~~ Haseeb Rana, and Jamal Awan created a criminal conspiracy * A spy ring in the US House of Representatives to subvert the fundamental processes of democracies, guaranteed by the United States Constitution * Including free speech and debate, between constituents and members of the House of Representatives and free and fair elections of those individuals * It's already completely different than the Beck lawsuit * Number two the Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, Anthony Weiner and Huma Abidin compounded the irreparable harm to the legislative processes by engaging in a pay to play scheme, moving privileged, private communication from servers located in the US House of Representative House of Representatives to Anthony Weiner's laptop device in New York City on or about June 10th 2016 * Any additional illegal transfers of data from servers in the United States House of Representatives, occurring between February 2016 and October 2016 will be clarified after receiving the house inspector general's report * That's going to be Theresa Grafenstine * Number three Imran Awan subverted subverted stated rules of the US House of Representatives to properly receive all communications devices intended for members of Congress to the offices of the chief administrative officer in the House of Representatives * Mr. Awan illegally received deliveries of iPhones and iPads intended for use by members of Congress to his home in 9667 Hawkshead Dr Lorton Virginia from government reseller CDW in February 2016 newspaper accounts from the Daily Caller suggests that the stepmother of Imran Erwin Gilani testified that these phones were then illegally sent to Pakistan and then returned to the United States * Which is of course illegal * Imran Awan and Omar Awan entered into a conspiracy to create fake employees in the US House of Representatives Human Resources system called PeopleSoft * The illegal administrative rights were created for Imran Awan in this system and a scheme was used to reuse personnel records of retired employees of the US House of Representatives for fraudulent loans from the US Congressional Federal Credit Union * Imran Awan number 5: Imran Awan and Hina Alvi engaged in a scheme to send fraudulent payments from these fake employee accounts in the US House of Representatives from the u.s. Congressional Federal Credit Union to Faisalabad, Pakistan * Federal Bureau of Investigation's records has compiled evidence of hundreds hundreds of illegal transfers * And we will move to bring these reports to the eyes of the court * We believe the corresponding internal report exists in the US House Committee on administration * And we will move to bring that the eyes of the court * Number six Imran Awan, Hina Alvi, and Rao Abbas did engage in espionage activities--espionage activities against the people United States, by taking electronic devices such as thumb drives, hard drives, laptops with trade secrets and General Services Administration bidding information to Pakistan, for disclosure and sale to business entities in Pakistan * Imran Awan number seven and Debbie Wasserman-Schultz did conspire to commit fraud at the Democratic National Committee, through a series of *email phishing schemes*, financially attacking backers of Bernie Sanders and other progressive candidates in 2016 elections, by defrauding the ActBlue donation fulfillment system in 2016 * Again, I talked to Jared back he did not know about ActBlue * So this is even even the part the one part that I talked about elections in this lawsuit, I include very specific information about a phishing scheme * ActBlue to ActBlues: Jared Beck was not aware of that when he filed his lawsuit * this is completely different lawsuit * The Inspector General of the House of Representatives treats a Grafenstine has known of these frauds for at least 18 months, and has not moved to protect the legislative and election processes in the House of Representatives, thereby has been negligent in her duties * The plaintiffs seek the equity powers of the court to immediately enjoin this active spy ring in the US House of Representatives, by revoking network privileges and administrative rights to Rao Abbas, who is still still employed in the US House of Representatives, and immediate production of all documents related to these investigations of the Awan Spy Ring named above, including s FBI money transfers these are the suspicious activity reports and the US House Inspector General's report on the of October 2016 * The remedy here: the plaintiffs believe that sunshine is the best remedy in the case of irreparable harm to the faith of the people in the United States, and their sacred institutions of democracy the US House of Representatives * Publication of all investigative reports in the Awan Spy Ring is the only is only a first and small step in restoring the people's faith in this institution * But we believe it is necessary--it's a necessary first step in the long slow healing process of the American people * Venue: the venue will be here placed here properly in the Washington DC where these crimes were committed, and where these remedies of repair must begin * We have to start where the repair we have to start where the injury occurred here in the United States House of Representatives here in Washington DC * Damages: a much smaller lawsuit this is the Beck lawsuit in scope was brought against the DNC for 300 million in damages * The objectives of this of the plaintiffs here are to restore democratic institutions, not monetary * So we will use this smaller figure obviously, the damage is much greater * But we will use this very very fractional figure in damages in our case * And in deference mainly to the great work that the Becks did on their lawsuit we will not the true damages are probably in the trillions * But we want to make sure to be clear to the court that our objectives here are sunshine and restoration of the democratic institutions * Looking forward to your comments thanks very much * Of course will sue on Rico of course will cite the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of course will cite the Espionage Act of course will cite other laws that may have been broken * But the key point here is there has been a fraud on the people of the United States * But also a spy ring in Congress which has destroyed our democratic institutions, both legislative and elections * As Haley as all the leaders of the house have said: an attacked by a foreign power on our legislative process is an attack on democracy * I believe Ted Lieu said that * I believe Eric Swallwell has said that * I believe Frederica Wilson has said that * All the people in employed him righto on in this process should now join me in this attack on democracy, and support a full investigation of this of the spy ring * Which I believe has gone on since the year 2000 in the US House of Representatives --- * [New Awan Summary Playlist - YouTube](URL * Day three of the Awan trial this is a test video of my new Awan summary list playlist * About nine videos I believe I'm sorry there's 15 videos * But a size down list from the previous larger summary "

Iranium, Uranium, Lets Call the Whole Thing Off - YouTube](URL * This is Day 15 sorry about the noise could there be any better depiction of Hillary's uranium ratlines * I could not if I had the rest of my life to try to come up with a perfect depiction of the uranium ratlines, I could not do it * That's it right there * Now was it Oregon Energy LLC that was very Iranian being taken? to 340 different sites in Oregon? That Oregon Energy LLC had? * Is Wyoming a throw? * Is it was a really Oregon Energy LLC? * We don't know that * But interestingly enough before the uranium one deal is done, there is this interesting set of FOIA documents * FOIA documents for the 13 different agencies that had to approve the council on foreign investments in United States as CFIUS * So in the uranium 1 deal these records are preserved right preserved * And this is one case where FOIA is actually going to be helpful * So that's going to be great * We're going to be able to see what each of the agencies saw * And what their thinking process was before they said 20% of America's uranium is going to go to Russia * We don't know if it actually went to Russia or it stops somewhere along the way * A little stuffed in Pakistan * Maybe a little stopped in UAE * Maybe a little bit stop in Uzbekistan, if we had a reactor there * Maybe a little in Ukraine * I think we got a couple of reactors there * We don't really know yet * We know some of it stopped in Europe * John Solomon's reported that some of it stopped in at NATO was schandle own a part of that * We'll find out we're going to be able to really drill down on this * But uranium one is going to be important here * Now this is also district taco * You can see the target I think that's right about where our head was... Jason and I there was Jason's target is on the left and my target on the red dot was on my head on the right, up there at District Taco * But this also unlocks the whole deal * As you're doing these deals right, you want to be doing this in clear text or an email * You want to do this in secure pin messages * That's why just up the street not too far at the Fairfax County Jail there Fairfax County * Somebody works there JTTF up there somebody works up there I can't remember his name * Maybe ~~fried egg~~ Freitag--I'm not sure * That's up to you guys to decide * But the Blackberries are gonna tell the story, * Because you're not gonna be saying, ""hey I got a great idea: the Department of Interior says there's 340 different sites, and this guy maybe it's Finicum maybe it's somebody else, but they want to take advantage of it-- well it's all on u.s. land there, it's all on farm land, these farmers shouldn't get it they owe us money now. We should get it"" * So former company called Oregon energy LLC, and we'll ship it * Hey they don't need it--we can't keep it here, because then it would look bad * So let's ship it * There's uranium ratlines all over the place * We'll ship it everywhere--that is the epitome of uranium ratlines * Hillary's uranium ratlines * It is going to be the key * Now, you've got to truck the uranium * When it gets there, it's yellowcake, it's the halfway point between not very much uranium at all, slightly radioactive * Now yellowcake it gets a lot more radioactivity it so it's reduced about a hundred to one or maybe a thousand to one from the reductions I saw I saw about five pounds go to about five grams * So whatever that reduction is * Now the next step is refining it spinning it in a bunch of cylinders * Is that going to be Iran? * Is that going to be Ukraine? * Does it switch in 2009 from Ukraine over to Pakistan, as Pakistan starts gearing up their capability to refine an enrich uranium? * We don't know * All we know is there's two trucking companies involved * One's RSB. The other is transportation logistics. * We don't know a lot of background about RSB other than the fact that they are supposed to go from Kentucky straight up north to the Great Lakes stopping in where at where else Chicago * We have to look at that. * Fortunately every time you move uranium there's a copious amounts of paperwork involved, which we can use to and I've seen all the RSB paperwork we can chart this * So this isn't something that's speculation or fake news or whatever * It's here's the document * Now yesterday you saw published the letter from transportation logistics guy named Ravenscroft * Where it was like, ""hey do you remember you said we're gonna ship to Charleston Charleston is going to become the funnel point for all our uranium?"" * So take one of those arrows and just in your mind put a big Charleston in there * If you have to imagine Jimmy Stewart and it's a wonderful life * Hey scrunch! * If you have to imagine Jimmy Stewart wonderful life when he's doing a Charleston over that--doing the Charleston over that pool that pool that had that sliding in memory had the sliding--the thing save us another building, George * Save us another building * Just think of that Charleston Jimmy Stewart right there on the end of one of those arrows think of Jimmy Stewart doing the Charleston * Charleston is gonna be key key to documents getting those documents * Again, we're not going to FOIA and Hope-a Hope-a the Judicial Watch * It's great to see tom Fitton yeah every grandmother would love him {{ his midline diastema--isn't it endearing? Lots of deepstate actors also have this }} * But we need to force issue need to squeeze the toothpaste * We need to go in for interrogatories * We need to go in for what's called request for admission * Admit that you knew Imran Awan since 2004 * Theresa Grafenstine is a part of the loop: what I call the Spy loop * Now I'm not saying she's a part of it, I'm just saying she could be used in a spy loop * What I mean by that is I steal the information as in my spy ring either with the Russians with FusionGPS out in Maryland, * Or I steal it in Congress with Imran or I steal it with Huma I get the information * Now I turn it around I either fund an investigation, and give it to Theresa * And get somebody get rid of somebody in Congressional hearings that way * File a finding: basically it says hey there's wrongdoing here I could do that we're about get rid of whoever I want * Then I give it to FusionGPS and then have them go secretly testify in Congress to take out whoever my enemy is * So it becomes a loop * Now I'm not saying Teresa Grafenstine is a part of that loop consciously--I'm just saying she could be used * So this is where we need to really drill down on Teresa Grafenstine and find out exactly her amount of involvement with John Podesta in this kind of ring * Because really the architects of this whole ring is John Podesta * John Podesta is using Tony Podesta as the bagman * He's using all of his Georgetown Law buddies to create all these organizations * So that he's got attorney-client privilege * He's got these little stop gaps at all the points to stop any kind of an investigation from moving forward * And I'm not saying he's not a formidable opponent * He's got every Georgetown professor that ever sat for the bar examination, in the most advanced law town in the world as far as Federal law is concerned * So I'm not you know knowing that this isn't a big hill to climb * {{ 911: ""It's not like I don't know this is a big hill to climb"" }} * But truth also is very powerful * Truth---you just have to let it out * A little bit of time sometimes * But eventually we're gonna actually find out through FOIA and other documents about Hillary's ratlines * And that's going to go right into the election * Because if you control the election, you control the ratlines for another four years * And the Department of Interior is going to become important * Oregon Energy is going to become important * The trucking company that you hire to move this stuff around in Uzbekistan Kajikistan, all the stands shipping it to wherever they were, and then bringing those people on visas into the United States, it's going to become very important * SAIPOV is going to become a very important * His partner in all the trucking companies is going to become very important * Was Saipov's trucking company that he had with Rashid---the company had in Florida, in Tampa, and the company had in Illinois: were they involved in this ratline somehow? * We don't know yet we need to keep drilling down --- * [Day 15.2.

Congressional--check--on the--written there by the United States Treasury * We don't know. * I don't think we're gonna get bank records * I've been told we'll know if he left a country * So that's Customs and Border Patrol or Immigration and Customs * ICE it's either ice or CBP or TSA--I don't know but somehow somebody fill us in on that * Now we only get 25 of these questions * So they're like silver bullets there is one strategy which is ask those questions that will move this story forward in terms of just all the questions we have * We've never seen a picture of this person we think we might have in the Daily Caller * Let's really get down to is this a real person or is this just a school play that's been put in front of us * Or the alternative is we could ask a whole list of questions in there interrogatories * But they could say things like well this is an investigation this currently involves a person that's under investigation I'm sorry I can't answer * So I anticipate that response * So I want to craft the first couple of ones just to firmly establish the facts in the case * Then we can move forward with the more extensive interrogatories * I am looking at several rounds of interrogatories, just with Theresa Grafenstine * Because I know she's here I know she's here at 1919 * I think all the other conspirators have fled the country but I know 1919 Lin Street is where she is she's also a member of this professional organization that gives worldwide lectures and talks to CEOs about cyber hacking * So she is the worldwide expert on this * She's be chairman I believe is of ISACA and lots of I's and C's and lots of A's in all of her titles that she's got just like she's got like nine titles and they've all got C's and I's and A's * I'm not saying anything there at all * All I'm saying is I think several rounds of interrogatories with Lisa Theresa Grafenstine is going to be key early on * If somebody could tell me how long she has to answer that's also going to be important because I don't want to do 10 days 10 days 10 days 10 days * I want to move the story along quicker than that * And again, I I would say to leave a Teresa Grafenstine you could come forward at any time do an interview with Crowdsource the Truth or one of the other video platforms out there and eliminate a lot of this * But the answer of well--there's a bank fraud investigation going on over here * So we're gonna let the capital burn, while we figure out this the little bank fraud over here is not acceptable * Should a person who is the Inspector General for 20 years in the House of Representatives be responsible for a spy ring in Congress every year that she was there? * Or at least since the year 2000? * Are you responsible it are you derelict in your duties if you don't notice a spy ring? * Remember you're a worldwide expert! * Worldwide expert in cybersecurity! * {{ 911bs: Their ISACA assessment test that I saw is a remarkably silly, nontechnical self-assessment test for making confimation-biased self assessments.

This is Day 16 * The uranium one indictments are in here in Washington DC * There's 20 indictments * If you just think about it, very simply, why would you seal these indictments? * Three or four years later, * There's this rumor that Tony Podesta is one of the sealed indictments doesn't make any sense * If you're gonna indict somebody, you don't seal the indictment: you unseal it and you indict * So I think this whole Tony Podesta thing is a throw * What I do know is there's eight dead Rhodens that were involved in trucking, along the ratline, along the money of one of the uranium ratlines * So if you were designing a throw here, you would throw the dead Rhodens under the bus--you'd seal those indictments * Now the prosecutor can still try these people with quote unquote in death * And that way it creates this mystery around who are the twelve * But I say it's the twelve Rhodens to me that makes the most sense, because they were prepared indictments before the Rhodens were murdered * The Rhodens didn't like being sent away to prison for driving this uranium around, which is really gonna be drugs in one direction and weapons in the other * So they killed them * And that leaves--you have to backfill with Uzbekis and I believe that the New York killings * Again, if Saipov is not involved in all these different trucking companies, this discussion doesn't occur * But when I see people trying to cover up the fact that these Uzbekis have all these trucking companies, especially in Paterson, New Jersey in Port of Newark...I think * Big move--all these innocent people being killed to cover the small move * I think you're gonna find a few murders in Chelsea * I think it's going to be a two people living in Chelsea * One end of the ratline it's two people going to be living in Paterson New Jersey and I think those are going to leak out over the next couple of weeks wherever those people were killed * But it's going to be the people in the ratline * Which leaves eight alive * That's that's how I look at it, just very simply * If you look at the whole deal excuse me with the actual documentation, don't actually look at what people have said and leaked to the press, because that's always wrong * This is the reality, right * These are the real numbers * You kill eight Rhodens and you had a truck--there was 12 total trucks and transportation logistics, you're gonna have to backfill with those Uzbekis--bring them in * Now if you look at the number of people that he brought in that Saipov brought him it was 23 * So then the math works * If you look at the official story you've got uranium going in all directions, highly enriched uranium, supposedly going to low enriched * Just look at the original megatons to megawatts program * You've got these 90 percent uranium to somewhere too low enriched 22 down even 3% that could be used in reactors right * And that's supposedly come into the United States * That starts in 98, coming this way when Hillary is the kind of shadow Secretary of State * Then all of a sudden in 2009 everything switches and we start sending uranium from the United States back to Russia * It doesn't make any sense * The megawatt the megatons to megawatts program is Russia uranium to the United States, not the other way around * All of a sudden if you start looking at the documentation again, not looking at the press stories that have been leaked * Because what they do is they they make it all a mishmash and confusion * If you look at the documentation the two trucking companies in the United States * One of them's going from Paducah Kentucky up to Canada * And they're taking this yellowcake uranium, and they're they're not spinning it in Paducah anymore, they're spinning it up didn't Blind River * Now nobody's managing that process and * Again, it's immediately somebody something that Hillary is going to take advantage of if nobody's managing it * It's a very small town of Blind River * I can spin this up here to make lowly low enriched uranium or even high enriched uranium and then I could truck it to Montreal * And I can sell it to all the nations of Europe for their weapons programs * Nuclear programs for their nuclear reactors which they use quite a bit for big customers in nuclear reactions especially France * And also for their weapons program * So for me it just seems like Port of Montreal and this drives with the New York Times story the John Solomon story * And also some of it going to Asia * This to me is the Montreal piece is the one going to Asia okay * So let's look at this ratline here of getting this the old ratline, which is starting in 1998 megatons to megawatts * You had to take it down this long path down through Pakistan, and then ship it over here to this Naval Warfare Center in South Carolina right here okay * So this was the path of uranium going this way right to to this Savannah River Site * This was the old path alright * That's when they hired these Uzbekis-- that's how Uzbekis got involved in the old ratline * And they the Punjabis Imran Awan's father...the Punjabi police force brought in Uzbekis to police this ratline * This ratline was--I can show proof that that ratline was established by the Pakistanis * And they brought in Uzbekis is to do that ratline * If I have the Rhodens on this one on this line here to take stuff from Kentucky or Piketon Ohio where they lived up to Blind river for this this ratline, the Europe ratline--that's why I have to get rid of them * If they if I and if in the 2015 indictment they're one of these 12 indictments * And they all said ""hey I'm not going for that"" * Now remember they're using these containers for drugs, right * So you get rid of them * And then you have to bring the 8 Uzbekis over here to backfill * That's where I think this 23 is coming from * This what Trump is talking about here's the 23 Uzbekis that come in with this guy Saipov over time * Saipov ~~sigh puff~~ comes in over at 2010 in the beginning of uranium one and then he keeps adding these people in these trucking companies in Florida in New Jersey Paterson New Jersey in Ohio he's got two company ohayo he's got one in Chicago * So if you look at the one in Chicago, that could be for the traffic from Paducah * If you look at the two in Ohio that could be the traffic from pike town * It's actually can play with those ratlines, but that's that's kind of what shakes out here * Now we have two pieces of information: transportation logistics sending a Ravenscroft sending a letter to South Carolina, saying, ""hey this is this is where we're going to be sending it: South Carolina is where we're going to be going in and out here"" * And then we have export licenses going from one of the trucking companies--a lot of export licenses going from the RSB trucking company, but not transportation logistics * I say the reason why we have RSB is because that was the clean line * And the one was the reason why we don't have any of the transportation logistics is because that was the dirty line * And again, if you're Hillary, you you just do simplicity * If I have customers over here in Europe, for this highly enriched uranium, and the low enriched uranium, I just have the Uzbekis take a left turn and go to Iran with this stuff * I don't really put it on ships the same thing over here * If I've got customers over here I just sent it to Europe * Now this cover story that John Solomon's be given--oh 20 percent of US uranium went to the EU, and some went to Asia * It's always worse when they when there's no specificity to the stories, it's always worse * That's the one thing I found in dealing with this situations * At some time, I've been here it's gonna be worse I say the Canadian stuff is going through the Port of Montreal * This is the Bouchard deal to NATO * And then that we have a picture of Lambert mark Lambert filling up this UF6 container * These are containers are huge going to Russia * Now this this ratline of Mark Lambert sending this US6 to Russia makes absolutely no sense whatsoever through Pakistan * All we have to do is figure out where that UF6 huge containers going in Pakistan * That's what's being filled up with weapons * And the on the return trip when it's coming back for servicing to Louisiana, I'm saying it's again, Awan shipping company in Louisiana * That's where the drugs are coming in * As well as I think also to South Carolina * I think there's two paths in maybe even five or six * And these I'm saying are going to be the BlackBerry ports * It's going to be Jacksonville Tampa South Carolina in well North Carolina * I think it's gonna be the Navy base they're basically the Navy base is all up and down here in Norfolk * This is Pax River I think in New Jersey * In here in New York you're gonna have Newark area all the way up to Montreal--this ratline here * So I believe that the Awans are right in the middle of this whole thing * I believe the PSP, the Punjabi PSP was originally brought in to establish this line * And that became the cover for the drug line that currently exists * Still exists * Goes all the way back to 1998 it goes back even to 1980, 1979, all the way back to Zbigniew Bryzinski * But this Uranium was the perfect cover, because you're not really sending the uranium back and forth--the UF6 * You may be selling a sending a little bit of yellow cake on the top to create this sense of hey stay away stay away stay away * But most of the container--remember Hillary in Arkansas made Park-o-meter, which was really fake nose cones for planes, fake door panels, fake fuselage panels...for hiding drugs * That's her expertise * I saw Bill Clinton over at at Johns Hopkins University, Bloomfield thing * And I love Bill Clinton that the--he's just seemed so sincere about--he was talking about the opioid crisis * He's so good. But if you turn down the sound it doesn't make any sense * If you really wanted to stop this traffic, you'd stop the UF6 containers going back and forth * The whole uranium one thing makes no sense * If the megatons to megawatts program was uranium coming this way, why in 2090 do we reverse the flow and have uranium going in the other direction? * Makes no sense whatsoever * It's not about uranium and UF6 going back and forth: it's about drugs and it's about weapons --- * [Day 16.1.

Deep uranium * Deep uranium * And what's deep uranium saying? * He's saying there's a 120 square miles under cultivation in Pakistan and Afghanistan for heroin coming into the country * That's what deep uranium saying * He's saying George, it's coming in on these Maersk ships, and they're using containers that are radioactive from uranium * The code word I chose for him--this is before June 16th--The code word I chose for him was deep uranium right * Now Here I am in Zanesville Ohio, going to meet two informants right in there * I'm gonna meet two informants * This is gonna be Zanesville right here where I'm standing * And this is going to be Piketown ground zero * I was going for three reasons * 1) I was meeting two informants in Piketown--one's a law enforcement officer who had information about RNL trucking, yet another trucking company * Yes like the Uzbeki trucking company, like transportation and logistics * Again, trucking uranium * The Sheriff, DynCorp Sheriff identified there was named Pfizer * He was involved in a deal where, people got in trouble and he blamed the people who were whistleblowers for trucking uranium * RNL trucking check it out * They also weren't in trouble for shipping illegal cigarettes """"fentanyl"""" and other opioid cigarettes opiate and opioid cigarettes in * So follow the felons * You want to follow the ratlines, follow the felons, okay? * So that's number one I was going to RNL trucking * 2) I was going to Clinton County see Sheriff Pfizer Dyncorp SHeriff * People remember those episodes * And 3) I was also going to Piketon Ohio to meet with the mother of the eight people that got killed out of a trucking company that shipped what drugs and uranium okay * Now here I go * Now remember your JTTF--your job is to protect this * Your job is to make sure nobody ever goes in there, because that's ground zero * That's fusion center of the bad kind--that's where a reporter figures out the whole thing * So here I go, as I get closer * Now remember there's a whole bunch of people on this episode that we did * ""Clear and present danger"" right * There's deep uranium's on that I don't know if he was on that episode or not I just talked to him * We had identified the Memphis Maersk as the ship right * And we had identified it was going into Charleston, South Carolina * Which we now know transportation logistics says is the place where it comes into the United States, right, where the uranium comes into the United States, okay * Now they didn't go after Jason * They didn't go after the three people who called in and said ""hey there's maybe a dirty bomb on this thing... there's there's a ship is radioactive"" * They called me in * And then the only thing I had wrong was it wasn't diplomatic containers, it was these UF6 cylinders, which are much bigger * I had missed the fact that these cylinders these cylinders are much larger, and you can send them back and forth every day * Diplomatic containers you only send once every time you move * So that's good business, but it's even better to do UF6 containers * And now we have a picture of guess who Mark Lambert putting something into a UF6 container in Louisiana near Awan shipping in Louisiana to go to Russia * Now you can't get there--to where they were re-enriching the uranium or lowering the HEU to the LEU in Russia without going through Pakistan * And it's gonna be Uzbeki truck drivers okay * So now let's reset the scene * Here's JTTF. They're watching me now. I'm going toward Piketown, Ohio where these eight murders are * I say these guys are doing uranium TRUCKING and drugs * They have an industrial drug operation * First person I meet with law enforcement officer * He tells me they've got hydraulic lifts, they've got forklifts, they've got ramps, they've got a whole underground operation climate control everything * Now I get five calls * Five calls in a row from Customs and Border Patrol * They're all about three minutes long * Why? Well they want to know all about * I say hey these guys the Awans, they're shipping these containers, they're irradiated * They could be used in a dirty bomb * I never said that * I never called the Customs and Border Patrol out but I said that's what the people on the show we're saying is that these could be used, right * So I missed it * I should have said UF6 containers--I missed that--the radioactive connection * But I said there's four--there's gonna be four diplomatic containers * It turns out there was for diplomatic containers * But the reason why they were pinging me, and later the FBI and Chris Whitaker of JTTF South Carolina admits to this * They started pinging me to know if I was on the move going toward Piketown * Is he going toward Piketown?

this case for drugs would be U.S. Border Protection * US Customs and Border Protection * And the third level is kind of that where the task force all comes together * The task force all comes together at DHS * DHS is the highest level in the hierarchy (I don't know what they're building over here maybe they're burying the servers maybe they're bearing the BlackBerry service who knows) * But to my right is the Coast Guard kind of master center for all communications heading up to DHS, for all over the world I believe but mostly the United States ports * And it's gonna be called the United States Coast Guard TISCOM, which I think means telecommunications and internet or services internet services like phone services communication command command * Command like like our other commands and those commands this used to be where the radio station used to be * I think my dad was familiar with this where it used to be like the Coast Guard had the radio * Like it was like Washington I thought it was Fort Washington or something Washington because it was old ground at Washington yet * But it's an older facility but then they've got some newer stuff here but they use the communications protocol of the DoD to talk to all the other people in the Joint Task Force JTTF * So that protocol is called SIPRNet * And if you watch the episodes way back when with Quinn he was talking about cyber net which is the secure internet routing protocol SIPR or protocol routing something like that cyber cyber net etc * Quite a few buildings for some reason and I think radio I my dad used to talk about this place * So anyway SIRPnet you you get a blackberry you use Blackberries to talk on the SIPRnet * Now the last thing and then you could have regular computers at your command center where these JTTF joint command centers would be and I can't remember what they call him a green room or something like that where you would have one of everything * And SIPRnet would be your key if you were doing a JTTF Center SIPRnet would be critical because that's your military that's Navy Marines obviously Army and all that all on blackberry critical * So you can see it's an older facility but still has kind of that mountain vernon feel to it to be honest with you * I'm gonna switch hands here for a second * So anyway we can I'm always a little bit leery filling filming US military installations * But there's nobody here and that's why I always do it on Saturday I always stay far enough away we don't do any any license plates * I really try to keep my distance to be seen and I don't try to get up close I just tried to get people a general feel * Because my brother was in the Air Force he got shot down * So I mean I know how this is with military families * So my dad obviously as well but * So I think I'm safe here * I think the radio tower back there I think they still use it for radio I'm not sure * But the key point I'm trying to make is this is critical for DHS drug interdiction drug interdiction * As well as interdicting things like a dirty bomb * I believe it all kind of I believe Chris Whitaker down there that night the red light flash concerned citizens were saying hey check this out * Now how that got to the FBI and that then got to Ohio to electronically track me down and then lure me out of a lot, well we don't know--we're gonna find out * I have standing now * Oh Patreon * So the bottom line here is the Blackberries are the key to letting people know if the operations are on or operations are off * And what they have is these play books * So they'll have may practice these things this isn't random * So they'll have just like a football team: we're going to do configuration A today which means we're going to be looking at more at the Delaware today I'm gonna simplify it there's lots more than this * Or we're gonna run configuration B * So let's say we were at the Coast Guard Station at Ocean City Maryland * Now a let's say they're all going to Philadelphia * great if you're in the drug business you bring them all in the Navy Yard you bring them all up the Potomac you that that's important information if they say this is kind of one if by land two if by sea if if it's be there running the B configuration which is hey let's guard the mouth of the Potomac then you take them to Philadelphia or Wilmington you take them up the Delaware River * And Ocean City Maryland just so happens to be that station * Now I'm sure there's other stations that cover those I think the southeast area covers Charleston * But I think Ocean City Maryland covers the mouth of the Delaware and the mouth of the Potomac--I'm not sure please check it please check it * The key point I'm trying to make is if you're a JTTF officer let's say in New York--let's say you were down here is a law enforcement officer in Virginia somewhere 10 years and I'm not saying this is Freitag I'm not saying this is Freitag * But then you go to New York and you spend 10 years in JTTF in New York * Then you move back here in 2007 or 2006 or 2008 whenever] * And by the way he lives here in this town where I'm standing right * Now right here by TISCOM just so you know * Now maybe maybe maybe two miles away no I think actually he lives in Alexandria * So you could be on a team with somebody on a Coast Guard team on a JTTF team * Now I'm not saying I'm I'm just connecting dots here--I'm not trying to make any implications whatsoever * I'm just saying this is how it works * I have not seen any connections with Freitag and JTTF. So far * But there is this one funny Twitter account, that's called Barry Freitag like maybe you like Blackberry Freitag? * This is Freitag's blackberry I don't know but it is a funny name * But that's ok aybe the guy's name is berry Freitag but what's really funny is he sends out these codes you can check it yourself at BarryFreitag like some people's derogatory nickname for the president {{ ie: Obama alias: BARRY SOETORO }} * {{ 911bs: We know that Obama was using Hillary's server^^[[bo1]](URL Political correctness fears among the UK police allowed Pakistani drugrape gangs to flourish and now terror attacks there are routine^^[[pcp]](URL Are we falling into that trap as well? Equality means at it's core, the courage and truth of calling a minority person a bad guy, if they are. }} * So BarryFreitag and they're like 12 digit codes letterssomewhat it's almost almost like but I'm not saying this for sure until somebody verifies it like a blackberry pin code * Now you would send a blackberry pin code like that to run an operation * What you do is you set out your BlackBerry pin codes at the start of the day through your secure Network and I think everybody knows is pretty well known and we're gonna run the Delaware today * pin code B we're gonna run and these are all encodedso I'm not giving away any secrets * We're gonna run the run the Potomac * So I'm not saying that Barry Freitag's doing that * I'm not saying he's getting out--I mean he may be the guy who says here's the play we're gonna run today because I'm I'm the JTTF guy I'm like Chris Whitaker down in Charleston * I don't know if Charles Freitag is that guy I don't know * We just need to check * But if someone got ahold of those codes and could understand and decrypt those codes, all I would have to do is give them a Blackberry * And they just punch in the code and they would have the plan for that day for the coast guard * So unwittingly accidentally extremely carelessly if someone in an IT department gave out those codes, you would literally have the keys to the kingdom * To be able to come in the United States you'd know when to come in and when not to come in * If you were a ship's captain on the MAERSK let's say you would know it it weighed out and have a little bit of mechanical difficulty out at sea while they were well the Ocean City guys were guarding them out for the Potomac * And then you would wait so you've got that code that they went up here to the Delaware * Oh that's not I only get you by the first thing the interdiction part right * Coast Guard you still got to worry about Border Patrol--remember? * Chris Whitaker then and next person to call Charleston was U.S. Border Protection * Third person to call was DHS * You would need somebody you would need somebody at you US border for Customs and Border Protection right * It'd be great if you lived with them * Guess what we find here in Alexandria? * We find an Awan or we find an Awan with them M turned over * So I'm on we find in AMON * Now that that's not a match that's not a hit--you say George that's not a hit well * It is if she lives at 6314 Thomas drive with Imran's first address and went in when he comes to the Congress * That's a pretty strong match--if Nadia Amon is living with Imran Awan and she's US Customs and Border Protection * That is concerning, especially with the secret emails, especially with the John Wilkes phone booth, especially with the inauguration burglaries, especially with the credit union Halloween credit union robbery robberies, great train robbery, great credit union robbery * H e's got a lot going on Plus that I'm not even counting the Bank frauds * he's got a lot going on * I don't want that guy who has shipping in Qasim and works for the port of Karachi and has this AB Auto imports in Florida and has all these car companies that seem to go out of business all the time all over Virginia * He's got a lot going on I don't want that guy living with us custom and Border Protection sorry * Don't want * And then finally let's say you get up to the final third call like I had in Charleston * You get the DHS * Finally you get that threat assessment what is what it's called at DHS--threat warning--threat level you're gonna raise the threat level you know this thing orange-red * I'm going to cross here nice new road they put in for us * So I wonder if some fiber just went down they usually wait till the last then put the fiber I just I don't know what it is I can almost smell fiber I just strange I just feel it right in here Wow okay * So the final one is DHS * Well if you're playing video games with the guy who runs you're in Congress you're playing video games with the guy who sits on the emerging threats committee * He gets all the alerts from DHS * He needs to be ready at a moment's notice to go to a SCIF in the Congress right * Who is that? Andre Carson * You would need a guy almost babysitting Andre Carson just in case just in case the first-level: Coast Guard check didn't work * The second level Customs and Border Protection didn't work * And the third level is DHS * Well we're in luck * PATREON PLUG * So there you have it weird weird all these coincidences * As I said before in that article that I put down a lot of times people are unwittingly being used by these people * You don't you can't see the big picture you're just doing your job you're trying to raise your kids I think Laurel is in that camp * But you need to tell everything the whole truth and nothing but the truth because that's how we're gonna get the spy ring out of Congress * If you leave out the fact that your husband may have been involved in law enforcement, may have been up there in New York as the police officer, may have been involved with JTTF, may have been be JTTF down here we don't know * But somebody bare it bury somebody bury Freytag somebody is sending out these codes * So it just worries me when that starts happening maybe it's nothing * So all I'm doing is connecting the dots * Putting it out there for various authorities to do it that what they like * Remember George Washington was the first person to do this * He engaged the residents on the coast to keep the fleet well * To be the coast watchers * Those are the first people that Washington employed residents citizens citizens on the first JTTF * All we are doing in the crowdsource community is being that first set of eyes and the first set of ears * We're seeing something we're saying something * That's all * OK We can move on to visit the homes of these locations that we've spoken about --- * [Day 331.3. 5521 Eyler Drive - YouTube](URL * Okay so the title of this one is 5521 Eyler * I believe that's the right address * Is there any doubt now * So it's about a half mile * It's so close to the test calm the coast guard just calm literally I walked here I walked in a whole bunch of ways up another direction I came back it's literally that just calm the Coast Guard kind of blackberry Center is just down that Street * So this is really close I mean it's about a mile I would say to maybe a mile and a half from I'd say about a mile maybe from the TISCOMM to here * Which is great because if I work for Customs and Border Protection let's say I work for JTTF that would be really convenient that would be like a mile to get to work * So or you could walk to work * So I do have my water * So don't worry about that * So I don't know this is just research but these codes there's these codes going out and a lot of people have said already this is kind of like The Da Vinci Code * It's kind of like a fun DaVinci Code family puzzle this is going from place to place and getting clues and stuff like that * So kind of like most complicated scavenger game ever * And there's a lot of DaVinci Code here--Tom Hank's a lot better looking though * Anyway but with these codes when you have these codes and especially what they call a joint code you'll have a 20 digit alphanumeric code and the first three digits are the Coast Guard * The second three digits are the Navy * The third three digits are DHS * The fourth three digits are Customs and Border Protection * The fifth three digits are and I don't know this to be true * I'm just saying as an example * There was just a recent one on the Enigma machine this kind of reminds me of the Enigma machine as well another Alan Turing and all that * So the way it works is just like the Enigma machine there was these three digit letters, alphanumerics * And these German pilots during world war ii would key in the three letters * So a lot of times what they'll do is put a new cipher out every day and this is exactly what happened in World War two right before the bombing missions for that day for the German bombing missions * They would put out the three-digit code and the German pilots would--navigators would crunch away their Enigma machines and would tell them the message that they were getting from headquarters * Very old concept * A joint code is just take the six agency that that's that's in your joint agency * If your three digits you're you know just it's almost like let's say there was a joint operation like the Navy Marines Army Coast Guard it would be a longer code, but you get the idea * Now it turned out the way that Turing figured it out, if you haven't seen the movie, is the German pilots would always I think they changed the code once a month * And the German pilots would use the name of their girlfriends the first three letters of the names of their girlfriends * So Turing they talk about the computer and everything I don't know how much you build Bletchley Park I don't know how much they use the computer yeah everybody wants to say they invented the computer but anyway * Turing somebody this this woman this woman who's played by oh gosh to the real the blonde oh I can't remember name right * {{ 911bs: Kira Knightly, or in my mind: daily and nightly }} * Now oh gosh she was in Pirates of the Caribbean she does a low-rent movies sometimes too but she just she did a good job somebody's gonna know who was in that movie with enigma and come her back come her back and then the English actresses name got a lovely accent but anyway Knightley Keira Knightley yeah Keira Knightley * So she figured out I don't know if this is in the movie but but the real woman in the real world figured out hey what if these are the first three letters of their pilots girlfriends names because there was a consonant vowel consonant or consonant vowel vowel * And they didn't think that was right begin with * But then they figured out how many how many people were in a German bomber crew * And then they figured yeah what they're doing is just rotating it through * This kind of is the right story I don't really know it's it the movies different and I don't know which one's the true story * But anyway that's the story of Enigma machine I can't remember what they called the movie with Knightley * But anyway the true story is a a woman I think I've told her story seduced a Polish mathematician on a bear rug at some Lodge hunting lodge and got the and got the code that way * And that was ""cast no shadow"" cast no shadow but I digress * Though that's for all the code people that like the code stuff--DaVinci Code--I think the Vinci Code had a cipher thing too or they had to put something into a cipher * But the bottom line here is if you know the cipher you can decode that day's ship movements--you can decode that day's movements of material * And the codes are pre-arranged and pre-planned so that it's all coordinated so all the forces move together in coordination * Again, if you had a sect or group that you had sold aid let's say a ratline to like for drugs or whatever * If they had the codes that's gonna be really valuable information, because it says the force configuration of what you're trying to get get around ok * So where I'm heading to * Now and I really don't want to go in or go up and knock on the door * I know everybody gonna want me to knock on the door but I want to respect them the distance of the family here * But I do want to know from this Amon gal, do you know Imran Awan? * Do you work at U.S. Border Protection Customs and Border Protection? * Do you did you really live at 6314 Thomas or no and do know Imran Awan * So I don't think I probably don't have to even go see it says 900 feet * I'm getting close I probably don't even have to go very close because I don't really want to bug people at their houses and stuff I don't really want to show their face or anything * I just want to figure out what the heck are these codes going out for everyday because if those codes are compromised the whole system collapses * This is what I'm talking about the big chessboard right * So I'm on Greendale village following me I think says 700 feet and I'm going to 5521 let's see here it's on your left 5521 * 5521 Elyer Now I'm not gonna go bother the innocence here * They're innocent people I don't want to bother these folks I know that they're good hard-working security professionals for United States government * I just want to know if they know Imran Awan with Laurel and Charles * I just want to know if they know where Rao Abbas I want to reenact the meeting with Rao Abbas * I am a mile or two away from laurels house if she wants to go reenact the meeting and find out exactly where they met worth we're in the town where they met we're in Kingstown * they met here somewhere it's a small town of 15,000 I'm in Kingstown she wants to call me right now, we'll go over and reenact it * Bring your husband as well * We'll all meet we'll all say hello we'll all break bread * These are great professionals these incredible people right that want to help right * So they'll certainly want to do this reenactment to find Rao Abbas * And then I can ask about the codes what is up with these codes if these codes were compromised what would happen * So as I said the lot of the folks here you could be living with Imran Awan be the most patriotic a whenever or a Mon ever right * But if Imran has your laptop that's not a good thing--that's a bad thing * So 5505 I think I'm getting there * 5507 so these kind of townhouses * So yeah there you go it's gonna be right there * So what I'd like to do is has folks who know Nadia to get in contact with her * Send her email, Twitter, whatever. Say hey George or crowdsource the truth wherever or Fox News, CNN * But whatever it is publicize it publicize it talk about the codes talk about the the fact that this could be compromised--This the system here * So I don't know if somebody just showed from a distance I don't want to go up and bother them * I know everybody's gonna say doctor Corsi's gonna say knock on the door knock on the door okay * So there we are right I'm not gonna knock on the door I have no interest really in exposing anybody or embarrassing anybody or putting anybody in danger * {{ 911bs: What's the point of going there if you aren't going to knock on the door? }} * I just wonder about these damn codes going out * And I wonder if there's a compromise if somebody has compromised that if Nadia is living with Imran Awan that's true--then I'm worried * This is what I said before about vectors: connect the dots * Maybe it's somehow we don't know maybe Charles somehow knows Rao Abbas * Maybe somehow Nadia has Charles's email * And they communicate because they're on JTTF * And somehow Imran has those codes * But I do know one thing if you have the code * Now the codes could be lottery picks there alpha in America not in numeric, so that's probably not true * But somebody's gonna know what those codes are about and that's where we have to figure out who may have compromised the codes * And of course what you would do this is why you say something's a clear and present danger * This is why you change the codes * And this is I mean anybody who's doing any kind of code system builds in a capability to change the codes dynamically * So again, we're not trying to expose anybody here * We're trying to shut down a potential loophole * if somebody has access to her laptop that's the vector we're talking about * That was the vector that Dave explained so well in seven seven seconds * All right so that's that * If you know Nadia, ask her if she knows Imran --- * [Day 331.4. 6314 Thomas Drive - YouTube](URL * I'm at 6314 Thomas drive * And if you remember correctly this was the first house I ever went to when I got here on April the 10th * And so it was that kind of that house that was kind of set horizontally back * Well the story gets even better * Oh by the way my drivers my drivers Pakistani and his parents are in the UAE all of his family's in the UAE * We were talking about Urdo and all the boarder and how long to get from one thing to another but it turns out that take let's make the fun thing for a gum * Gum being like be-gum we're gonna be-gum for a minute and Suriya Begum right * And we're gonna be a big blob of gum that's coming down from the sky and landing on this place and we're gonna glue three of these houses together it's gonna be Thomas drive 6314 6313 and 6315 * So your job out there on the internet is to figure out is it this house here I can't see it it's so dark * Is that 6313 I'm guessing 63 13 would be on the other side of the street I thought * (I'm in complete darkness I'm sorry I just ran out of time I ran out of daylight) * Would this be 6315 I don't really want to walk up to somebody's house at night but the interesting thing here on this corner you can see the lights are on * So there's people up there I don't want about bug anybody I don't want to harass anybody * But the interesting thing is bee gum if we had this gum come down from the sky and land on us and cover us all we would all be gum right we would all be gummed right * *Well those are all going to be BEGUM INVESTMENTS* * ***BEGUM INVESTMENTS are going to be in all three of those houses*** * So what's interesting about begum investments other than SURIYA BEGUM owns BEGUM INVESTMENTS? * ***The interesting thing about SURIYA BEGUM is it's in the Panama papers*** * ***BEGUM INVESTMENTS is in the Panama papers*** * So if a big blob of gum came down from the sky and landed on us and stuck these three houses together we would be gum and they would be BEGUM Investments * Now what's interesting about BEGUM INVESTMENTS is it's gonna be connected to our friend Johar * Remember Johar and Gauhar the guy who had 40 tickets on under one Passport? * Oh by the way my Pakistani driver said that his dad couldn't get a UAE passport unless he married a UAE gal and he was really hard to get a business over in UAE from Pakistan so that's interesting * ***But he did say there was a shadow in DC here there was kind of a shadow royalty*** * So anyway begun this big blob of gums gonna come down and stick these three houses together your job should you choose to accept it is to figure out where the heck 6313 is and where the heck 6315 is but those are all BEGUM INVESTMENTS * and Johar is also going to be involved the guy with one that has 40 gets 40 tickets under one passport and then 17 under another I don't know if it's UAE and Pakistan or not * A lot of activity right now here on on on Thomas Drive * So we can look at this corner * If you look at all the corners but the other interesting thing is these three houses are all going to be connected in another way: * They're all going to be involved in a company that Suryya Begum starts called AWAN TECH * AWAN TECH almost sounds like I mean it almost sounds like technicians that are hired by the Awans * I'm gonna just go out on a limb here and say it sounds like to a technicians hired by the Awans * And there's gonna be kind of like a business here it sounds like a bunch of programmers being hired * Now one of the guys who gets hired it's gonna have the job of all the military records--all the military records in the United States * It's gonna NGUYEN I think is I think it's ng you I am I don't how you say that she's gonna have all the military records * The other person that lives gonna live here is going to be that place where we just came from * And her name is Aman which is like Awan if you turn the W into an M * Aman lives here as well and now she has a renter that has all the Navy medical or Navy credit union * So I keep seeing this Navy credit union and and Congressional Credit Union and and then we have this other situation with the Pentagon credit union * So just this repeating thing with the credit union thing * And then also the medical records thing * So anyway that's for right now look it up in the panel on paper see a BEGUM INVESTMENTS is really there there's a search engine you can use and also you can look and see if you can look * And see if Gauhar is in the Panama papers remember he was on the Interpol list and I believe his partner ended up getting tagged for bank fraud * His the other guy Gauhar had some great deal in Scotland * I mean this is really getting crazy * So I'll do have to do another one to explain all this * Brainy Blonde has a real good explanation with lots of dots and arrows if you want to see it * I just thought you might want to be there I thought you wanted the immediacy of being there --- * [Day 331.5 Freitag Code Breaking - GSA? - YouTube](URL * Good morning this is gonna be a very quick one * I went to what the sleep last night around 11:00 * Got back finally from all my running around in Virginia * And yesterday I kind of finished the last two episodes with talking about code breaking * And these codes that Barry Freitag and * Again, I don't know if this is Barry Freitag the law enforcement officer or not, sending out these codes * But there one two three four five six seven alpha numerics, followed by six numerics, * And I didn't know if that was a FedEx number or if it was a GSA contract number * Or if it was a bill of lading on a ship of Memphis Maersk bill of lading * That would be an import genius I was just kind of like not able to sleep almost thinking about this * And I thought well did I look at when these things were sent out * And I had what since this account looks like it's removed now---I always think when somebody removes something that's always a good sign continue to look at it if something's removed * And I don't know if that's because I did a show on it or not but I thought well okay * So I went back into the archive and it's five tweets in February 2014 * And what I thought was interesting was for someone to create an account in February of 2014 * And then a hundred and forty-five followers and I don't know why I immediately thought of Imran ordering a hundred and fifty phones from CDW-G and GSA in to the February 2016 * And of course the the burglaries or whatever they're banned from the network is February 2017 * And of course if you trace that back to the the inauguration of the 20th, which I still say is the day of the 2017 burglaries, they give a false image--they're told they're told to give an image of this off-site server to the Capitol Police in 2017 * And they give us false image (Becerra) and they put the Capitol police off for eight days * And then the Capitol Police figure out on February 2nd that they were given a false image of that server from the from the burglaries--the 20 burglaries on I believe it's gonna be the night of the inauguration * Because I believe the plane felt flight from Pakistan to UAE was on that same day * But we don't know but it's just something worrying you almost can't sleep * So I just thought I'd put it out there * yeah I just thought this was an odd pattern of of the five of the five codes going out on the same day on the 20th 2014 * I thought well if I had Congress is coming in session in January or maybe February is the CDW reorder date for the new phones it just seems like this repeating pattern of February February February * Now it could be completely I mean this could be I call this Freitag code breaking because once this kind of davinci code thing is gets in your head you can't stop until you figure out what the heck is going on why would you send out these five codes? * And you know in the past that talked about these blackberry codes and I've talked about how you get access to a whole bunch of different contracts a whole bunch of different email if you have these codes and you key in these codes * And I thought well if everybody just got their new blackberry if all the Freitag, just folks got their new blackberry is he sending out codes for--loading in your phone * Now this could be he's just using Twitter to communicate to all his people and let's say this let's say Barry Freitag isn't involved in some kind of I'm an undercover operation or something like that and these are all people who are loading GSA contracts into their phone * Or they're loading for whatever reason * But I thought well with the association of his mother at GSA--are these related are these numbers related to GSA in some way? * And if I was Imran Awan what I exploit that * So again, I don't have an answer here but I just started thinking what the heck are these five codes and why would you just why would you only have the five tweets in the account and 145 users is a lot of followers * And then all of a sudden nothing all one day five tweets and then nothing * And I did not for some reason I just thought of hey if you were loading new phones for Congressmen, you would you would do this * This would be contract one this would be contract to you three four and five * And I don't know maybe it's because I'm in Camp Springs or whatever the reason, but I started thinking about this headquarters this GSA headquarters in camp Springs being involved with the Citizenship and Immigration Services * And this new headquarters, which is a big deal here in Washington * Huge new headquarters just just going into service right now * And of course this is Andrews Air Force Base as well which is having its Air Show right now * So it's almost like for some reason I'm thank you something's going on with this these codes over here at GSA * It could be related to citizenship * It could be related to bringing in bringing in new citizens our new people in Congress * And under these programs maybe these are immigration programs--but it's just one of those things where I couldn't sleep * I'm like what the heck is this code that he's setting out he's he sent out five of them and then nothing * And then I thought immediately well 145 Blackberries February 2014 * It's a hundred forty-eight Blackberries on 2015 * They switch over to iPhones and February of 2016 * Imran switches over for the CDW GSA * These are GSA contracts all the time with imran * So I thought if there is a Nimrod connection maybe it's through this kind of February repeating pattern because then * Again, there's this burglary in February 2017 * It seems like this this changeover is always in February of all these phones * And the number is always right around 150 * So I don't know I'm gonna just put that out into the internet * So I can go back to sleep * I realize it's early in the morning it's 2 o'clock in the morning and no one's gonna see this * But anybody has any ideas what the code this DaVinci Code here might be * I called the Freytag code--not the da vinci code * Now I'll put that out to the internet and hopefully we can sleep * Any ideas this is just odd the 5 codes with 145 followers * Who were those 145--I don't know * It could be complete coincidence, but I thought I'd put it out there --- * [Day 332.1 Rejoinder To Washington Post Quoting Me in Awan Brothers Article - YouTube](URL * Good morning everyone my name is George Webb Sweigert * I'm a journalist here in Washington DC I've just been quoted in the Washington Post today * And I would just like to not really have a debate with the Washington Post or rebut the Washington Post * I just would actually like to file this rejoinder to the Washington Post * Basically just adding the facts that the Washington Post left out * I think there's good reporting it's a very long article but basically taking one of my conclusions or one of my working theories rather than all the body of evidence and then trying to do the labeling of a right-wing conspiracy theorist label label on a corner case of some working theory that I am working on * So I just want to file this rejoinder * And this is just basically the facts okay * So I got involved in this case on April the 10th of this year * And I basically went to all the homes that were purchased by the Awans * I was looking into the background of all the homes two key homes are one is on in Springfield Virginia and that's on Thomas Drive * Then the other one here is Hawkshead drive here in Lorton Virginia * What I had found there and this kind of broke the story was I interviewed this marine here named Audrey Taggart * He had called the FBI he had had Naval Intelligence come over to look at these this equipment that Imran Awan had left at this Lorton home * Now I don't know how you could leave that out of this story * There was smashed hard drives here * The Capitol Police ended up taking this * So there was three investigations FBI a Naval Intelligence and also Capitol Police * I don't know how you could leave that out of the story * He's testified on a video testimony with on a channel called Crowdsource the Truth that there were several Blackberries here with government markings laptops with government markingsnow * We don't know if this is the detritus of a burglary in Congress--But it may be * We do know that four days before this * So anyway I went interviewed this marine this black marine here his wife's in Naval Intelligence and works at the Bethesda Naval Hospital--I believe * Excuse me we put that on earth very early here in Washington 5 a.m. * So so that's the key here is the the smashed hard drives * This is where the smash drive hard drive story comes from * It comes from me. So I know that they call into question me as a journalist but the Washington Post later had this story and still did not publish this story * I believe the Washington Post is still sitting on this story. * And this story does remind you of another Washington Post story * Which is Watergate * Which [was] an original crime a burglary and then a cover-up * So and I'll go through that but like I said I got involved in April the 10th * ***Four days before this Imran Awan was caught in this building here in the Rayburn office building what I call the John Wilkes phone booth, now on the very very famous John Wilkes phone booth illegally accessing the network and potentially backing up terabytes of information according to the Gateway pundit and other sources of information to hard drives*** * So there's a police report for this that's been suppressed by the prosecution not just the defense the prosecution * So this is the cover-up potentially four days before I get to this home here in Hawkshead in Lorton * Now what were they covering up what were they erasing we don't know but we do know that there is a burglary investigation that happened--I believe on the night of the inauguration * And then that was kind of the last gasp of them collecting their assets and making a break for Pakistan, which I believe they left for Pakistan on the night of the inauguration or the next day * A false image was supplied of the server that was made here on the night of the inauguration by representative Becerra's office to the Capitol Police which delayed the investigation of a week * Then the Capitol Police found out a representative Becerra produced a false evidence to the Capitol police here for this burglary * So what we have here is kind of the detritus of a cover-up * I got there at the end of that * The sixth actually was this famous incident with the John Wilkes phone booth * And then that was probably a cover-up activity of this this burglary, which has been widely reported in Daily Caller and Politico and New York Post etc * So 20 burglaries of Congressional offices * I don't know how you could leave the burglary the think Inauguration night burglaries out of the story * I just don't see how that's possible!! * In any kind of journalists who what when where how and why * Now what what the original crime may have been though is this CDW order * Imran Awan worked with a government contractor called CDW-G which is for government only * And the rules of this government contractor are to log these phones anything intended for Congress to log these phones and deliver to a government location * Instead he had it delivered to his private home * It was 150 iPhones and Blackberries * &gt;&gt;CONT"

We're at the boat pond it's a beautiful Central Park here * We've only got two boats going which is too bad these kids might be radio controlling one of them * And then I think there's one down there but anyway kind of fun couple couple stranded over there huh far bank here * I was thinking ratlines going around the world Maersk vessels Mohammad Ashraf Shah with this blue sky net * Or what was that called blue sky blue sky with the Iridium the company that he had in Texas what was this company Mohammed Shah * Mohammad Ashraf Awan I think was blue sky net blue sky net I can't remember from the but if you see that sent us that little clipping from the series of the blue sky net * But usually if you're living in Virginia you don't start companies in Texas to to to manage boats going around the world to look at that and * It's funny because his daughter and married Imran was into nano SATs Nanoset * Selling the technology managed these boats going around the world really hasn't come out in the mainstream reporting yet has it Nana set technologies and the different transactions they've made you seen that come out the two end I haven't seen anything you see anything about new dawn new new dawn corporation 2001 that's formed in 2011 I haven't seen anything what is it with blue sky link it's blue sky link it's blue sky link look up blue sky link LLC I believe it's Waco Texas but blue sky link or maybe it's Sugar Land Texas blue sky link iridium * So anyway that brings us to the trial which is coming up on September 1st we rock August 31st for Imran * Now I don't know the actual structure I haven't looked at it I'm obviously out and about meeting folks * I believe it's Channing Phillips is the the US attorney for DC I believe he reports up to the Deputy Attorney General which is Steven Wasserman * So I think his boss - Steven Wasserman and they were talking about three months ago replacing Channing Phillips * So I don't know if they're replacing Channing Phillips or not I don't know what's happened yet * Oh really 126 for watching * Now drop to four anyway * So so the first thing is is Channing Phillips still the guy who's gonna do that case and it does he work for Steve Wasserman or not * That would be really good for Trump to know Trump should know who Channing Phillips is and Trump should know that Steve Wasserman strike this case * And in terms of expanding the case I think Trump should know a lot about the other should have thumbnails of all the all the houses and businesses that Imran owned that would be nice anyway Trump's tweeting * Now about Wasserman is that what he said I don't Oh day night 192 talk about Wasserman Okay. * All right I guess people have the search capability that 9/11 body-snatcher provided and they're bringing up all the things * So I had a conversation with Jason he mentioned hey this phone thing it's going to be good because you'd be able to prove these calls coming in from DHS * I have thank God I have it a law enforcement officer with me that night who's also contributed to this show who I can vouch for these three calls coming in * So if they were deleted those phone calls were deleted that's gonna be an interesting situation if those phone calls were deleted because I have a witness that those three calls came in * So this is kind of fun this is getting fun * Now cuz I didn't think the phone is gonna be * So much fun with the phone string got to be a lot of fun * Now if I do show the three phone calls coming in it'll show the durations of all those calls and I'm gonna need that anyway for discovery * So it's gonna be great because I'm gonna use that in my discovery which is which is awesome * So so this surgeon how these discussions are accretive and helpful in that discussion * So now if it turns out that if you think about it * Now a little thought experiment if it was just me and sleeping in a car and not waiting for a contact then I doubt it would be connected just to something that happened in South Carolina from Ohio to South Carolina who would have made that connection * So quickly in one hour that night right * And how would see a note and know in New York right how would CNN be able to connect those dots in New York how would Donny be able to connect the dots an hour later out an hour after it happened how would they be able to connect this port situation to Ohio? * Which means somebody in the between somebody in between who was pinging me and knew where I was it would only be somebody who was picking me pinging me who knew where I was there would be able to answer that question * Which means the FBI which means the FBI provided Donnie the location of where I was and provided the basis of the interview * Now it turns out we have the call recorded that Donnie placed with us Jason and I when we're in the hotel in Ohio and * Now if I present the facts as they happened which was the true story * Donnie chose to print the facts as planted by the FBI * Now he's a state actor * I believe he becomes a state actor at that point when you stopped acting like a journalist * And again if jury decides this not anyone else the jury decides the law the judge gives the law but then the jury decides * If the person stopped if DA need to stop stop being a journalist boy I'm getting all this action Chrissy Francis is just doing an amazing job adding stuff to the Trello board and what do screenshots though if you can't don't just do links but do screenshots cuz those are quick quick visual communicators * So anyway if it turns out he stopped acting like a journalist he was given both sides of the story completely we had had a 40 minute conversation right * And he deliberately decided not and again a journey decides this it's called reckless disregard * Wanton disregard or reckless disregard wanton disregard callous disregard all these disregards and I'm throwing this out there to the crowd * So that the crowd can kind of weigh in on this * But if he does that then he becomes a state actor then he becomes a state actor at CNN and has to decide whether they want to stand behind that or not * So that's gonna be interesting we're just gonna open the door remember that song when my love opened the door remember that one * It opens the door to discovery for me because I can * Now see did CNN receive payments with Smith-Mundt modernization * Did they receive training from anybody at Fort Bragg did they receive training from anybody and I'm gonna move over a little bit did they receive training from in Atlanta 12 did 1200 producers receive training from the folks in Fort Bragg or Army psyops because if that's true * Now that's Smith-Mundt now versus the first amendment we basically have a showdown at JT Army psyops is acting through JTTF right * So that's an interesting thing * Now we got fist we're gonna have a maybe a challenge between first amendment and Smith mutt modernization which is really unbelievable it's really this thing is really turning into a fun thing it's got to be like we need to adjudicate this anyway it may as well do it now right * So what's really great is everybody along the series has has learned along with me * So much on this process we may as well have a Supreme Court case where we have all this background rather than one more cold and not familiar with right * So this is great * So we're gonna do a probably end up doing a challenge to Smith Mundt in addition to the state actor thing which is which is another defamation case * So this is really turning into an interesting set of set of cases and again I don't want any renumeration whatsoever * I'm gonna probably look at journalism schools and then also people along the way that well anyway I won't say but I don't want the money I just want people to I really want the journalism schools to be established and and do something with their board of directors to try to kind of reverse this Smith-Mundt thing * So this should be real fun * Now the last thing was very quietly very quietly US Cyber Command * I'm not even sure where US Cyber Command is * I thought US Cyber Command was in the DC Virginia and Maryland area * I thought it was at Fort Meade because it's like near the NSA because my brother was there * Ayway I thought US Cyber Command was Fort Meade * And it got promoted if Dave if you're out there tell me if this is true * The US Cyber Command at Fort Meade I want to say it's not or could be over at Annapolis where Dave I think you worked there too * I think NGA is in it in just over the border in Annapolis Maryland they're somewhere near there * It's either cyber commands either at Annapolis or it's over at Fort Meade * But anyway it was under Stratcom and what's interesting about Stratcom at least the Strategic Command strategic command has kind of like is the boss of all the commands like CENTCOM and all those right and does strategic support * I mean in theater commanders are still going to make their own decisions but it does like strategic bombing like the B tube and that's at Offut Air Force Base Lincoln Nebraska come right back right back to the finders case were right back to Johnny Gosch and all that and right back to John decamp dying recently and Casey getting tipped over in his boat about an hour after he tells John the captain Vye to write a book about the Franklin scandal I mean it's all coming back to this Stratcom * But anyway US Cyber Command I believe gets elevated recently that's are the same level as unit unit command * Which would mean you are super hackers any these are your super hackers US Cyber Command are your super hackers would mean you're pulling that out from understood Stratcom * Now it's always my impression again this is me thinking out loud and not really knowing but really looking for help from Dave I believe Petraeus had us finger or thumb on top of Stratcom as well * Which means if you have yes cyber that means you can do all this attacking of people in in country in the US and then say via once did it * So you can be doing all these projects all these takedowns all these break-ins and then just like the Watergate burglars say oh it's the Cuban guys that did it it's the Awans everything sweep everything under the Awan rug but if they pull a US Cyber Command out from that, * Is that Trump being really smart and pulling it out from us cyber out from under Stratcom and putting it up at the Joint Chiefs level? * I don't know where the unified command it went to but but if they put it at the DC level, that means maybe Trump has the same capability that Petraeus has * So this is kind of shaping up into a Petraeus versus Trump on the cyber side which I really didn't think he knew about very quietly did that maybe Kelly did that that's very subtle but very important * So anyway you military experts out there come back to me on that * Okay. I'm gonna wrap this * Thank you very much * Let's find out if Channing Phillips is going to be the US Attorney let's find out if Wasserman is his boss I think it's really time to just start chatting out and sending out all the different homes at Imran Awan owns * Making sure that wass room knows about it making sure Channing Phillips knows about it all the different businesses all the different money being transferred all the different wires demanding all the different wire transfers to Pakistan for all the different houses have to be discovered * And the jurors the grand jury should see it all should see the whole panoply of wire transfers * Okay. Great I'm meeting with different people here in New York for giving me great information about different things that's what I'm doing at this secret meeting spot here * The boat pond * Ok Everybody this is fun take care --- * [Day 301.1 Muhammad A Awan, Have You Been Seen With FARA? - YouTube](URL * Okay. For some reason my camera is completely black hmm the photo worked but the video is not working okay * So I think I'm going to imitate John B Wells the great radio voice of caravan to midnight and I am just going to talk about the things on this radio program this morning because for some reason my camera has been disabled * It was working to take the screen shot for this episode but it no longer works * So I'm working on my John B Wells radio voice right * Now and I just wanted to say that on my Twitter I put out several documents this morning about a possible connection between Mohammed Ashraf Awan who is the father of Imran Awan and interesting ties to a company in Florida potentially A B Auto and imports * Now I'm not saying A B stands for Awan brothers but A B Auto and imports and there's a couple of other country companies down there that are registered to this Lake Albert Drive wind Windermere Florida address * So I've tweeted all these documents out and I just wanted to mention that it looks like they might be some of the folks might be registering with the foreign agents Registration Act * You remember when we introduced that a little bit earlier this year about six weeks ago when we were talking about all the fun folks at Katsyv and all the other fun GPS fusion GPS folks about a month ago aware or two months ago now almost when we were in Washington DC * So take a look at that I wanted to also clarify clarify clarify I have nothing * Now to do financially with Crowdsource the truth * I wish them all the success in the world * After about three hours of Greek versus Greek versus Rome and philosophy philippics last night with Melissa * The personality here in New York media--she grabbed my phone and put venmo on it * I thought I literally hadn't just learned of it the day before from my son of what venmo was * And he had actually because I didn't know how to use it had venmo'd some money to people back in Oregon * So anyway I won't go into the why I gave folks back in Oregon money for storage ignoring things but that's what happened for complete transparency * So the venmo thing is set up it's G E O W E B B these are not donations in any way this is only in support if you say I am NOT a 501 3 C I am NOT a 501 3 C I am NOT a 501 3 C I am NOT a charity I am NOT a charity I am NOT a charity * If you want to support the investigative effort that we're going through let's do that * And then you can you can choose to support me with the through venmo if you'd like * I'm sorry this is all radio but who knows maybe it's gonna turn out better all radio * I have a voice I have a face for radio anyway that works out good * So I'll just leave it at that I also published calls from the port of Charleston * And as I had said previously several times the other day I had not taken I had not made any calls to the Coast Guard in Charleston * I had received three calls * Well actually in looking at the record I actually took five calls from the port of Charleston: five * That does not sound like an uncooperative person at all I don't think * And I was in the presence of a police officer next police officer when those calls came in * So I just wanted to highlight that there's also a FARA listing I wanted to do the old Ronald afar a better place I go as my pun for the day * But that had over overtones of a copyright violation against Dickens * So I backed away from that * So I went with the Lee Majors and only only people who are very old will remember Lee Majors singing a song about his wife at the time Farrah Fawcett, but he saying it I don't know but I've been told I've been seen with Farrah something like that and * So I thought what the heck why not say has Muhammad Ashraf Awan * Has Muhammad Ashraf Awan been seen with Farrah only F A R A {{ ya dig? }} * An interesting company an interesting company called PTI LLC and I put out the link for that PTI LLC, formed in February the 2nd of 2017 * It's almost like it was reformed it's almost like they had this company in 2013 that I put out * And then for some reason something happened February of this year February 2nd and it reformed * Well looking at a couple of the companies you can go in and search the full text * So this is going to be a second pastime in America * Now beyond crochet beyond baseball card collecting googling this FARA file * But the two that came up interesting there's lots of names in there and that FARA filed the two that came up interesting were ASIF Mahmud in triangle Virginia ASIF Mahmud because I had remembered another guy by the name of Mahmud * So MAHMOOD and then the other one was Alpha refs restoration Alpha restoration in in the bronze * So there's another item of interest Alpha restoration in the Bronx * Now people have already said George you're prowling around the Bronx late at night between the hours of very early morning hours of 2:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. you're gonna get curfew violations etc * Well I think I've been very upfront all through the series that the ratlines don't happen between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. in the middle of broad daylight as all the kids are getting out of school * So they can see all the ratlines from the school bus * No that's not how it works it's exactly twelve hours later it's 2:00 a.m. to 6 a.m. usually but 2 a.m. before I am those are the golden hours * If you're gonna be doing anything untoward those are the hours you are doing it * Now I'm not saying any of the companies of interests that I've mentioned before are doing any of those things whatsoever * But what I am saying is if you do want to walk the ratlines, you don't want to walk the ratlines at 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. * You want to do 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. * So anyway more to come on that if I can figure out how this why the camera is not working * And good good morning to the George Webb radio show yeah John sorry you're great I love you John I love you too Kate Keely * And if you're not listening to John B Wells on the caravan to midnight radio show, you should, because he's got a incredible baritone voice that makes everyone feel good as they're driving across the country in their 18-wheeler * And I promise never to sing on the show again * So check out those things * Again I have no financial interest whatsoever in Crowdsource of Truth * If you want to support me there's now something called venmo V and M oh and my name on memo it should tie directly to my email address what's going directly to me it's G E O W E B B * We may make this radio well unfortunately can't make this radio show because it requires * So much on visuals oh my gosh I got to mention Trello Trello has been just Chrissy Francis is just doing an amazing job * With we had 168 new entries Oh what I would really love is all my data oriented document oriented tweets if we could just screenshot my document-oriented tweets the ones that I had on my old phone on my Twitter * And just put those in Trello there are * So many great documents that I've been kind cut off from again I am gonna try to recover the phone but it would help quicker again there's only 13 days between * Now and the trial only 13 days * So we of 12 * Now 12 of em Rhonda want * So and he know all be I saw another alias for Hina Alvi which was all the one anytime people are using 6 7 8 9 10 different aliases it's a red flag * Especially if they're borrowing a lot of money from the Congressional credit * I saw with a person that was in charge of cybersecurity my brother made a funny video about it called it kato kaelin but I think it's guys names Jim Kalyan Jim Kalyan was the sergeant in arms or the chief administrative officer in charge of security now has been put and yet the head of the Congressional Credit Union * Can you say cover-up?

- YouTube](URL * Okay Everybody I have a mic today hopefully that helps a little bit with the sound * I don't know if the sounds been bad or not but * So here we are at a 301 this is part two * And I really want to get away from first of all I have nothing to do with Crowdsource the Truth give them their money that the link that Jason puts out with patreon or however you want to give money to them * I have nothing to do with them don't ever give me any money if you think that I'm somehow associated with Crowdsource the Truth * I am not at all I have my own venmo account I didn't even know what it was until 10 o'clock last night and it's G O W E B B * So we are completely separate entities * You want to support what we're doing what I'm doing with my folks the venmode geoweb * You want to support the crowd source of truth and what Jase is doing go to Jason figure out what the patreon or however he wants to do that nothing to do with each other completely separate carved off * Let's go back to the investigation a little bit * Now huh because really we only have 12 days we only have 12 days left to expand the indictment * Time is ticking in going through the clock * So there's a couple of things that I have outlined and one is a very interesting company in Florida called a be autos and imports A B autos and imports * A B autos and imports I don't know maybe autos and imports is I'm sorry I'm doing a film * A B Autos in part is bringing in old cars about 16 year old Toyota store for some reason and also Nissans * Who knows why but they're being driven from the top of [SIALKOT] in Punjab * All the way down to the port of Qasim they're getting on ships don't know if they're in diplomatic containers or not don't know if it's a UAE royal family or not don't know if it's the 9th or the 7th emirate called the RAK UAE that they're being shipped under * But we do know that one of the guys who is the 7th emirate who runs it has a company called [SAFE CAGE] and what they do is they armor up cars * And they there's a well known ratline between the Port of Qasim and port in UAE * So so at the RAK * Anyway this company A B Auto and imports it has old cars really old car 16 years old * Now they'd be 26 years old cars coming in when it started in 2008 coming into the port of Jacksonville * Now maybe also the Port of Tampa * Now that's really really interesting because normally if it's a five hundred dollar car you wouldn't ship it all the way across the ocean to bring it to the United States, when there's lots of Toyotas that you can go to any junkyard or or any Craigslist and get one of those things * So that's odd to begin with but then the shipping of the luxury cars overseas in the opposite direction also is a potential problem * Now I'm not saying anything here about A B Auto and import * But I am saying it was owned by a guy named Muhammad Ashraf Awan * And that's Imran Awans dad's name Muhammad Ashraf Awan okay * Now we know the dad had his challenges he was involved in and defrauding twelve farmers out of their land * He was involved in I don't think I'm gonna get this train I'm gonna get the next one * So we know he's been involved in his set of shady dealings in Pakistan * So what we're trying to do is figure out if this is the same Muhammad Ashraf Awan, but there's also this other agency in Windermere or Windermere * And I think I get to next train I think I get the next train * There's also this Windermere organization that seems to be kind of like a loose network of something all over the United States * One of the one of the companies is associated with is alpha restoration in the Bronx * Now is that alpha Jolla's company to restore cars and build cars like like they were saying on crowdsource the truth with with Hudson deep Hudson * I don't know but I'm gonna go find out but one of the interesting things that has come along as this PTTI * PTTI is the company that was reformed in 2017 and it's again it looks like this I mean it looks like this kind of loose Association of car companies and importers and different it's a very odd loose Association just put it that way * But the most important thing about the two companies one the Windermere corporation or the Windermere Community Center or whatever it's called * And then PTTI is they're both foreign agent registered * Meaning that the people in the foreign agent registry the FARA laws you need to you need this is what GPS computer deep GPS didn't do is you need to register if you're accepting money for a foreign governments lobbying on the behalf of a foreign government * So this is really interesting that you would own a car company and then be also involved in lobbying for a foreign government * Now I'm not saying that's a perfect a perfect replay of what happened with Iran-Contra with the NADRA bank instead of BCCI * Now the NADRA Bank I'm not saying it's exactly the same way where they actually if you listen to Larry Nichols they used to take the money in the trunk the trunk of a car was the vehicle for moving things back and forth * So I'm not saying the weapons are going in one direction or ammunition is going in one direction and or the drugs is going in one way in the car trunk and then the ammunition is going the other way * But it's a possibility--you have to look into the different possible ratlines that exist * So that's what I'm saying it's I'd like to get a lot more in terms of VIN numbers * I know that the one Amtrak guy said there's no way you'd ever put a stolen car on that train he's guaranteed it * So he just basically put it out of out of the realm of possibility * But let's go ahead and do it anyway let's go ahead and do the research anyway on the VIN numbers * Because we got the ones involved in a lot of other things they use a lot of different identities a lot of different social security numbers * A lot of different names and aliases and again they are the ones that are have a four count conspiracy against them not me * Now I may be taking the blame for one of their Florida diplomatic containers that we're trying to slip into the port of Charleston * But that's another that's another story we're gonna continue pursuing that * We're gonna show oh by the way it wasn't just three calls I took from the port of Charleston it was five * I took five calls from the port of Charleston * So does that seem like I was being uncooperative? No it's being completely cooperative * So they did hunt me down they did it falsely imprison me and then they did smear me * So we're gonna follow that up as well * And we're gonna go visit {{ George holds up paper }} and maybe I've already been there there late? Who knows --- * [Day 301.2 Alpha Jalloh and Short Hills Mall Murder - YouTube](URL * Okay. Hello everybody more technical problems more technical problems more technical problems * That doesn't stop us here we're gonna keep telling the truth that truth leaks okay * So first of all I have nothing to do with crowdsource the truth * Nothing financially don't ever give me a penny if you think you're getting to crowdsource the truth * I have a separate account it's a venmo account I've created at 10 o'clock last night * Don't want to give any impression whatsoever I'm associated with crowdsource the truth in any possible way financially * If you want to give to me venmo venmo I guess it is spelled and then it's G E O W E B B and that's attached directly to my email * So it's coming to me okay * So that's out of the way * Now let's go back to the investigation an investigation with Alpha Jalloh we're looking at several firms and * Now we're looking at at the father the father of Imran Awan, Mohammad Ashraf Awan Mohammed AA--Mohammed A Awan owns a company down in Florida called * Now we don't know if it's the same guy but it's a be auto and imports A B and auto and imports brings in a lot of old cars they're being driven from the top of punjab up on the border of Kashmir down to through Punjab down through [Sindh] to the state of [Sindh](URL down into the port of Karachi over to cast seen a Qasim * That's where that special port is that i3 seaport is and these the 16 year old--now they're 26 year old Toyota's and Nissan's are being brought in by this auto import by this Mohammed A Awan--Mohammed Ashraf Awan: maybe ok * So there's also a community association they're called a Windermere the Windermere Community Association, which is this unbelievably large loose network of different businessmen Pakistani businessmen I believe all over the country * So it said just odd * I mean it's for a for a it sounds like Windermere sounds like like it's a community association for that little neighborhood or something * But if you look at actually the the foreign agent registration information--that's where Mohammed Ashraf Awan also registers * So it's interesting your car dealer, but when you register for FARA, you're registering the saying I'm accepting money from a foreign government to lobby * The reason why we put in fara is so that foreign governments can't pay to play * So that politicians here can't give favors to foreign governments in turn for bribes * That's what we did FARA * So it's interesting that Mohammed Ashraf Awan whoever this Mohammad Awans it could be my imran father might not be but he's also a foreign registered agent * Now in February of this year February 2nd I believe it looks like that kind of goes away and then they construct a new one called PTTI * Which is I don't know if it's Pakistani technologists Inc or what it is but it looks kind of like again this loose network of people all over the country all over country * A lot of around Navy ports Navy ports for some reason * A lot of around Navy facilities Navy Navy Navy keeps coming up Navy Navy * All these people just spread around Navy there's a couple little rock connections but mostly Navy * So I found one interesting one * I know if this is any relationship whatsoever to Alpha Jolla or not but it's called Alpha restoration in the Bronx, where I've been running around ok * So I'm gonna go visit there just kind of check it out * I am connecting the dots a little bit to this murder at the Short Hills Mall * I believe there was a theft ring a car theft ring that was stealing cars at malls * They were going to malls and and stealing cars as a matter of fact they were convicted of doing exactly that in New Jersey ok * Supposedly where Alpha Jalloh is right now * I believe that they may have been involved that car ring may have been involved in the murder of a man I guess he was about 35 hit the big national news was he was with his girlfriend and was murdered at the mall there * So I'm just I think he's a person of interest in this at investigation with that * I think also there's several different companies in the Bronx that are that are companies of interest right now * So I published to my Twitter feed and all this the full text of the FARA listings * So that you can go through and kind of match the different Bronx locations the different Yonkers locations * There's a couple of different ones in New York that just seemed odd seemed odd to me * And again it's a loose Association all over the country we just seems odd * But anyway we'll look into that more I hope you can hear this one * Remember to give money to me at TruthLeaks. GEOWEBB --- * [Day 301.4 Daylighting Ratlines - YouTube](URL * Oh hey hey everybody * So here in Yonkers downtown Yonkers and for a long time this river here the Saw Mill River Saw Mill River covered over covered over to put a railroad there you see the railroad station behind right and * So the people of Yonkers good people of Yonkers through the Herald Statesman here the local newspaper local civic action did what they called a lighted this river day lighted it brought it to life * I think it was about six years ago seven years ago they day-lighted the river * And that that verb just struck me day lighting that process and I decided * Hey day lighting ratlines--that's really what we are all about is day lighting ratlines * And I do want to work with a Herald Statesman to day light some ratlines that are going on right here in a car theft ring * These things are slow these are criminal networks I'm working without ability to have subpoena power and or even any kind of police authority * So I have to do things a little differently but anyway having said that * That all of our thoughts turn now to Florida * Again Florida Florida Florida why why why well A B A B that's I don't know if it stands for Awan brothers or not * So I mentioned in the last two pieces a bee autos and imports these really old cars being driven from the frontier of a cashmere I'm not saying that there are a traditional poppy field growing area but it does look like those cars are coming from a traditional property field growing area coming down through the the countryside of Pakistan to the port--port of Qasim * There's where Imran's relatives all run the port * And then where Imran's relatives all have diplomatic immunity to ship whatever they want * I'm not putting those two things together * I'm just saying I'm kind of tracing the ratline toward the United States just saying that this could be related because his father's name is Mohammed A Awan-- Mohammed Ashraf the one who owns that company in Windermere Florida * Now that's interesting that an inland company would have a lot of import/export usually they're on the ports are usually there at the port of Jacksonville or they have at the Port of Tampa I think they're gonna be at both ports and it's interesting how the operation is actually centered around Orlando which is about as in middle of the state as you can get in Florida * Now there's this other company A B grains and fruit or something A B grains and vegetables or A B grains and rice or A B grains and something in Miami * Now I don't know if Mohammed aa1 is a part of that as well but again it just seems odd that that A B company * Now they could be just a trading company that they they specialize in putting people in the wheat trade or the grain trade into companies and that's what they do and then there's another trading company that they do for for Trading cars old sixteen-year-old Toyota's going one way and very expensive luxury cars going the other way * So I don't know what the the basis of those thing is * But I do notice those that A B coming back again * And I do notice the one in Orlando area and then one now in Miami area * And as if the ones hadn't brought in from the Adila rice farms Adila is their name of their sister * Adila rice farms is Sialkot Punjab * Adila rice farms is where the area where those cars are coming from from the Sialkot area that Kashmir area that border contested area that poppy growing area up in northern Punjab * So I'm not I'm not conflating the two * Conflation seems to be the word of the day * Now complaining the two I'm just pointing out that the ratline seems to start around the poppy growing area * They seem to have a full trunk when they come down to the port of Qasim there does seem to be a lot of Awan friends in the port of Qasim * There does seem to be a lot of his relatives on the ships manifests * He does seem to have a close relationship with Maersk * They have somehow become talked at the port of you well they hold the United States into doing radiation checking in the port of Qasim, where they only watch it on a little tiny monitor * We have just a little tiny monitor here we everything in the port of Qasim * We have a little tiny monitor that guy from office space * So there's just a lot of things that don't make a lot of sense * I'm publishing a lot of houses that the ones were involved in that we're refinanced three times in four years * Again people do that but if you own 12 13 14 16 houses and you're refinancing all every year * Again it tends to raise red flags especially if you have a lot of different aliases a lot of different social security numbers * What's also interesting is this Kayla who who would have thought this story would also have a Kayla like Oh Jay with Kato Kaelin Kaelin * This story now also has a Kailen Kailen James Kalin James Kalin is somehow involved in this * James Kailyn is the head security guy for the House of

Joe and they're st. John -so that's two choices you got * But I've talked to I really believe in talking to the people who live here and don't have too high of a opinion of themselves who are willing to give themselves and who are willing to be down-to-earth and tell who they are and tell their stories tell me your story * So anyway I've done that I've probably done about 20 Yonkers stories right * Now and of course I'm working the Alpha Jalloh thing everybody knows that * So that's the backdrop that's the backdrop and unfortunately sometimes you're not always in the place where all the story is breaking * We were down when I was with Jason and we were down in Florida and we were interviewing the backs * Now all of a sudden all the story is breaking in Miami it's breaking in Orlando and I'm in Yonkers and I don't have anything yet and I feel bad about that but just trust me I'm working working working the Yonkers Bronx story the Bronco story things are breaking here but it's just not quite ready to spill * But it's just really odd that I'm here and everything's boom boom boom boom Florida Florida Florida Florida * So you probably all noticed the earlier stuff I've talked about with A B Auto and import * Which is in Orlando and all the wacky things going on with A B Auto and import and the old cars and the things coming into the United States and the old cars and is that filled with drugs or as it filled with weapons * Who knows who knows who knows who knows but Mohammed aa1 is the guy who is is in that company Mohammed AAA one * So good dog good dog anyway * So and then we talked about this A B grain and bean A B not Awan brothers could be anheuser-busch who knows A B grain and bean * And who knows how much money you make bringing grain into the United States and beans or shipping beans or bringing beans in * But it's I'm not kidding the other corollary company is A B grain and BEAN in Miami * So they're also shipping cars * So A B grain and bean you think you think they're shipping grain and bean * They're not just shipping grain and bean * They're shipping cars! * And a big part of their business at a be shipping or a be grain and bean and I don't know if the Mohammad Ashraf Awan is a part of a be shipping A B grain and bean but they're shipping cars * So keep drilling down keep your only down there's this guy named Edward Z wick * I think ZEEWICK is what his name is ze e wi c k ze w IC K Z wick I thought it was see wick when this guy from call called me from Louisiana tonight and he said see wick like SCA SCA quick but it's I guess it's Z wick ze wick * But he wrote all about this * How the cars were the vehicles the cars were the vehicles * And you would walk over to A BMW here and BMWs probably not a good example but the trunk is where the weapons go or the drugs go * Now this is a smaller car here * So you would think like over there that car would be a much better example bigger trunk drugs go in the trunk * This is the way they are doing it this is the way are they are doing it * I have now 500 articles into this 500 research clicks into this I'm convinced convinced convinced this is the way they're doing it cars diplomatic container this is a small trunk but big trunk drugs one-way * Luxury cars going the other way weapons drugs one-way weapons the other way * Exactly the same thing really just a continuation of Iran-Contra * So anyway I'm going to take some questions zi wick I don't know I don't know how you spell his name zi wick * Anyway one of the listeners said hey this guy's e wick wrote all about this exactly what you're saying exactly what you're saying you're you're 100% correct * There boom the see what guy * So find the see what guy and whatnot * So that's cool and I am done at this point * I never said I never had a wine it's Saturday night I've enjoyed myself I'm meeting all these beautiful people of course I'm gonna have a wine and and interact with them Z wick is the key name * So I'm gonna just say this I love Jason I love Trish I love crowdsource the truth * We built a great thing it was if you watch that show it's so beautifully cut and * So beautifully directed by Jason known all these fades and that logos and the fade-ins and fade-outs and then and that audio is so good it's just amazing Jason put together an amazing amazing amazing platform * I just hope that we can continue on focusing on the things that are really tearing our nation apart, which is a 14-year * &lt;&lt; Scrunch Represent &gt;&gt; * &lt;&lt;&lt; Scrunch sprouts represent!

Zeewick nailed it * The A B auto and import is going to be interesting as a company to look at in Mohammed Ashraf Awan * The other thing that's can be interesting is A B grains and beans * The reason why A B grain and beans is interesting is because I looked in their site * Basmati basmati rice basmati basmati basmati basmati * And if you remember earlier like I don't know 90 days or 120 days ago I talked about Adila Adila rice farms * Where the Awans were taking shipments into the Port of Baltimore and that a dealer is the horse Imran Awans's sister's name Adila up in wait how do you say it's * Sialkot caught like you see if you were in Gone with the Wind and you are a doctor you were looking at hundreds and hundreds of people that were injured if you wanted to see all the cuts you wanted to see all the cuts * How's it going scratching if you wanted to see all the cuts it would be a see all cut see all cut somebody said that it's high and you said how you pronounced it see I'll cut * So we're planning on be we're honing in on the cutouts that are actually doing this shit * {{ George very drunk }} * You don't register with a foreign agent registration you don't you aren't bringing cars in and out and then you're also registering as a foreign agent taking money from foreign agents lobbying * It's an odd combination * It's the same thing for bringing in a grain and rice * Boom chugga-lugga I got you * I got you of Mohammad Ashram Awan and you ain't dead are you? * So what Mohammad Ashraf Awan--we're gonna talk about the bowl of Huggies and we're gonna talk about the 12 farmers that you stole all their land * And I know you're not dead and that is a bitch life's a bitch * But you know what justice is coming * Boom * Anyway he knows it I know it nobody else needs to know right * Now and we're gonna stop right there thanks very much I love you Jason I love you Trish * You only to have absolutely incredible success but you need to focus you need to focus on this horrific spy ring that is infected our democracy like a cancer in the last 14 years * If you don't focus on that, for whatever reason you get off that get back on that because if you get this we don't need anything else * &lt;&lt; hey scrunch boom chuggalugga &gt;&gt; * This is Watergate hey Scott boom that's true no seriously we get * This it's actually the biggest story in 40 years this is Watergate times a hundred * Thanks everybody --- * [Nobody Cares ...

I'm not sure what happened but all of a sudden in the middle of my broadcast had jumped out to Twitter and ended my stream * So we're gonna try it again * I'm seeing here folks coming back in hopefully not sure if people are staying at the other stream or not but anyway I'm gonna roll forward * Good morning good morning Laurie okay * So I know if I see Laurie's here I know that the stream is valid and I am gonna roll * So what what this is basically today is I'm gonna open up a new series and I'm gonna call it the carriers in Congress it's give me a part of a gen a more general series called the compromise * And the compromise is really going to be 20 people in the State Department I think it's 19 but I'm gonna just call it the 20 in the State Department 20 in the Congress and 20 at CENTCOM * I think the reason why they kept it at that number was to maximize the pay to play but minimize the exposure * So I think that's how it started 20 * I think it started at 10 actually and grew over time, but we'll see * And that's what necessitated adding more straw employees where it just wasn't believable that he wanted it * Imran still wanted to get 160 thousand for being one of the four being the fall guy if anything ever went wrong for each Congressman but he could only work for three Congress and then at once * And that's how I think it went to six employees with three Congressmen per a1 and that gets you to 18 * So it could be I could be off here too it could be the 18 that are compromised * We just don't know yet but I think the ratio is going to stay the same three to one for every Awan fake for every Awan of fake employee there's gonna be about three Congressmen * But the key is that the blackberry 20 * So so I want to explain things from the top down I used to be in network analysis and when you analyze a network if you don't have a map of the network it's * So much more difficult to analyze * If you have a mapping network though it's kind of like a doctor knowing his physiology where to put the you know where to put the stethoscope and we're to listen to diagnose rather than just being blindfolded right and not being able to do things * And of course there's different places places that you find for surgery and location points the same thing * So once the network everything becomes easy * It's Hillary and then well I'll just go to the next I'll go to the next slide * But the control point the funnel point for all the information is the Awan brothers server * The CENTCOM 20 the State Department xx and the Congressional 20 all the compromised are going to be on that Awan server * And they're a mirror of that server is going to be up here in New York at the Clinton Foundation * And Hillary for America the one in Brooklyn the one IP address that answers in Brooklyn * Brainy Blonde sent me that and said oh no the Clinton email is originally in Redondo Beach, which I think is Clinton's brother Roger I think may live in Redondo Beach * But then it answered to that same one answered to an address in Brooklyn which I think it's the Cadman square * And that is the address where I believe this information has been going up until they they kind of moved it * Until the server story broke then they had to move it * So that that server in Brooklyn I think has been getting information they I called the SEIU clubhouse has been getting information for 14 years * And I believe the Daily Mail did an article about it and just MSM came out in 2015 when the server was first discovered * And then MSM kind of just ignored it but that that was the control point that was the mirror point * So this information has been coming up here for 14 years to the Clinton Foundation I think it goes all the way back to the original days of the Clinton Foundation * And someone told me that it was actually incorporated the Clinton Foundation was actually incorporated in Canada first and then moved over to the U.S. in order to cloud there's some kind of trade issues that it clouds the law, whereas it would be just straight forward if the Clinton Foundation wasn't directly put into it wasn't directly incorporated in the United States * Anyway bottom line is IP address I am saying that IP address the one in the Daily Mail article is the mirrored server * And there will be traffic - Imran's houses different houses as they move through Washington DC over the years to that exact email address * So I'm combing my hair now for everybody in the NSA * Now everybody in the NSA can just take the IP address out of that Clinton Foundation location in Brooklyn--it's only in California for a couple of days and I think that's just to throw people to say oh it's it's based in California it's not based in Brooklyn * But then it comes back to Brooklyn and that is going to be the mirrored server * And it is going to mirror on this blackberry kahuna server that hasn't come forward yet okay * So that is the mirrored server * So everybody at the NSA I know it's that data's been spread over five agencies you you can * Now today look at all the traffic between the Awan brothers server and the Brooklyn server okay * So like I said knowing the network map and in this case knowing the organizational structure makes everything very clear * Hillary ran the operation from the top * Now I'm saying that she did it with Petraeus and an junta of generals along with some senators * And I call it the Senate Armed Services Committee in no way am I just saying David Petraeus is the only person * Of course Kissinger is involved of course Henry Kravis is involved of course there's a cadre of CFR people that are involved * But I just say Petraeus as sort of the kind of the face of CFR * And they're running it through Hillary Clinton * Of it the person is running the Congressional operation the Congressional 20 the blackberry 20 in that Congress is going to be Anthony Weiner * And I know it sounds ridiculous, but this is the true Anthony Weiner * This is Ehud Barack * Anthony Weiner here and you're gonna he's been running this since I believe 2001 * It could both go back to 1999 through inter-american I think the Inter-american actually goes back to 87 * So this spying has actually been going on since 87 and with the BlackBerries * But let's just pretend that it just started with Anthony Weiner in 2001 okay with with the syncing * So I'm gonna call these people that are carrying BlackBerry's I'm gonna call them ""carriers"" * I'll use this to signify up very carrier * And here's how it works this is the Congress side or the one that's not pictured here then the one minion that's not pictured here that should be here is Philippe Reines * Philippe Reines is gonna run the 20 in CENTCOM * Now that the 20th CENTCOM the generals as I'm speaking already know that I'm they already know the Jill Kelley reception they went to the cocktail and cheese session that they went to they already know the party they went to they already know when they were separated from their blackberry * Right now let's do this * Now is the time to start calling local journalists, having accidental conversations in Starbucks * Now's the time * Find your local Starbucks in Tampa * Grab any journalists you the reason why I'm showing these small journalists companies the Bronx Free Press the The Herald Statesman the whatever whatever it doesn't matter how big the outlet is it's matter of getting it out * Believe me AP will pick it up the other agencies will pick it up * Start having your conversations with your local local press your retail press Okay. * I hope I've been obvious with that but I guess I may be some bill said why are you always showing these small newspapers what what's what's with the small newspapers the small newspapers is your leak is the way to leak Okay. * I've been trying to show the locations where to go to have the conversations if you don't want to go to Starbucks and make it that obvious go to Bryant Park here in New York okay * So with with Wasserman-Schultz she's obviously the person has to run this darn thing * It's an unwieldy structure it's been going on so long and there's * So many threads going in all different ways it's a very hard on we only thing I'm surprised the woman is not insane right * Now having to sit on top of this whole a huge spider web that's been created actually it's an octopus with 20 tentacles * It's actually run by Mike Kempner * He was the deputy he was WD DNC but he's actually calling all the shots at DNC and and Debbie Wasserman-Schultz was the front person for that * But you're gonna find that she is also one of the people that carries the Blackberries * And she's gonna have ratlines that go with it in her district as well * As well as the other standout one here in New York is gonna be of course Greg Meeks * Again Clinton's hiding behind people of color * Throwing people and of color in front of the bus in front of rather than them having to answer * Again using people of color as Human shields * But you're gonna the list of 80 that Luke put out is just gonna be the 80 that we know about I think the compromise goes all the way back to 1987 through Inter-American but at least since 2001 with Anthony Weiner and Inter-American okay * So and no Wexler is not the first person that met Wexler's not the first person that met Imran Awan * So it was gonna be Anthony Weiner * So how does it work once the person's compromised your sergeant in arms here is Adam Schiff * He's the one who brings holy hell down on you if you if you misbehave * And basically it's the target the the key agencies obviously * Homeland Security is way too great way to get visas isn't it a great great way to get EB-5 visas * It's also a great place to develop NADRA technology satellite technology once you develop a technology you can create kkn are can create different spin-off companies to sell surveillance technology all around the world * You can do that through an intermediary like Pakistani ISI * You can sell to all the African countries as well as Middle Eastern countries as well as all small island nations right * So you don't get too much attention and you can do it through a third party in Europe through a consortium through an investment consortium based in Newfoundland right * So is that an ocean no what's the island that Bouchard was on was it Nova Scotia was it Newfoundland well have to go back there and figure that one out Bouchard okay * So anyway there's the three key committees * The carriers are going to be obviously Andre Carson Indianapolis what you're going to be doing is in your district you're going to be using all the Federal all the different Federal programs * HUD obviously different Department energy and if it depends on your district but HUD and mainly in his district and that's your area of compromise * You're gonna do all the deals through the BlackBerry gonna do all the negotiations with whoever the operative is on the Hillary side * And run the operations through the BlackBerry through that representative * So most of this kind of crime network is going to be through the 20 districts * So here again is where I say look at all the districts in Congress with 435 districts it's only 20 it's only 20 where this is and this can really this really confuses the American people because there's * So much back-and-forth and Congressional acceptance is down to 8 percent and then people meet with their Congressmen go wow my Congressman seems like a really good guy what's happening * It's because all this has been kind of forced in forced in these rat areas in these 20 districts * Most of the crime 95% of the crime is being forced again people have thought the color being forced into positions of having to commit crimes for higher-ups ok * So again people have color being thrown under the bus * People color being used as Huma shields ok * So let's go to the why having that network map now helps * So much when you fight unknown the network map walking in here if I'd have known the 20 Blackberries were at this house I would have said hey Andre how many Blackberries were there was there 19 or was there 20 * I heard there was a pile of Blackberries I wouldn't have come in with a question to Andre Taggart at the Imran house here with * Hey what was there I would have come in with a specific question this was important this was critical actually knowing the for laptops and knowing the 20 Blackberries if I hadn't gotten that information I wouldn't have been able to figure out the network map * But with that boom now we know it's the 20 it matches the 20 at the State Department it matches the 20 burglaries that was reported in the Congressional report * Now we know the for laptops want to the Library of Congress three of the other ones in those key meeting rooms * So the three key committees boom were done knowing the network map solved this case * Knowing the network maps on this case okay * So today here's some here's the offer I'm making to Congress * I really don't want to do this I really don't want to hurt any of people that were forced to carry * I don't wanna hurt any of the people of color that were forced to carry--that were forced into this * What I want to do is is get to the DoD folks * I want to get to the CENTCOM folks I want to get to the people who put the spy network together * Because if we don't get rid of the spy network we really make no we really make no progress * Changing out a Congressman in New York District five doesn't nothing does nothing * It's the same octopus is still kind of * But there was a book called the octopus about the PROMIS software * And it was clumped over the capitol building * I think that's just a great great visual where it was if this was the this was the Capitol building something's gonna have bad happen here on my keyboard but then it was like it was like this this thing and and that's what really what we have and what we'd need to do is if you cut off one of the tentacles right it's not gonna do anything it'll just regrow any tentacle right you need to just cut the head off that that monster it's a monster and it's it's the Petraeus monster * Again don't mean to sing a lot David Petraeus is the only person * I'm just singling about it's a representative kind of for the CFR okay * So here's New York five and we're just gonna go zoom in on on these districts one at a time * Now and just talk about here's the JFK * So your major assets your major Federal assets that are in your district become the target of the ratline * So all you have to do in your district that's we're gonna outline who the twenty are that currently have the Blackberries * Then we're gonna start through the process of looking at all the Federal contracts for that district * Trello makes this * So easy I just looked at Trello board again and all this stuff is coming in we need to call them for every blackberry for every carrier * Again we don't want to go through this process but there's no choice if you leave us no choice * If you don't bring all containments on all six of Awans you don't bring indictments in all six Awans * And at least twenty five charges of on the housing side and at least ten on the black weapons side, including my case if my case is not included in this with the Lindsey Graham thing, I'm gonna pursue all Congressmen, I'm going to pursue all generals, I'm going to pursue all State Department * So if my case is not included on my black weapons case through the Awans and if those four containers are not included there's no stopping us * If that is not does not come down in the indictment * If that those diplomatic containers don't come down the indictment I have no choice * I have to exonerate myself * So so this is I'm just being very reasonable all right * So anyway JFK you're gonna see a lot of hanky-panky going on here at JFK you're gonna see that Mr. Weiner is going to be this key protege or trainer of Greg Meeks and this is going to come out * Again not idle threats there's these are going to be in the emails and we're gonna find a whole lot about JFK coming up * So again everyone wants to the popular press is Luke on Fox the other day popular press wants to cleave this DNC shenanigans from the normal pay to play stuff * It's a it's part and parcel the Awans's did do the DNC quote-unquote hacks and the the leaks were done * And when I say hacks I mean the Act blue stuff and stealing the money from the Berniecratz and bringing it over to the Hillacrats * Well by the way my venmo account is GEOWEBB * It has nothing to do with crowdsource the truth * So please if you want to support crowd-sourced a tooth go to there whatever links that they put out I am completely separate completely separate for venmo w GE o w eb b * The reason I say that is I don't want to be accused of doing an act blue here * I don't want to be accused of being doing an act blue * I was trying to be nice and support both accounts I was trying to say hey send it to me if you want at venmo at GE o w e BB and then you can also send to crowd source of truth * I don't want to conflate those two in any way possible now * I was--somebody raised concerns that there was conflation happening there I do not want to be accused of doing this act blue thing * Now this was real when you go in and actually chain an act here where I say detail and then I add an S * It looks the same it looked like new detail on IT staff or scandal when you're trying to give money back blue but when it says act blue here you think you're giving money if they add an S you don't really notice it but to a computer * That's a computer on the different side of the world that was a computer the money was going to Pakistan or at least her account first then on to Pakistan or wherever it was gonna go * So anyway, what I'm getting back on track here * The Awans did the hacking of the Berniecrats--they did the hacking of Bernie's money as well * The reason why the Chopra's should have a Chopra thing in here I'll get to the Chopras in a second * This all this fake billing these are going to be all these port deals all these port deals are going to have Iranian money * So if you have a port you're going to be a part of this if your Debbie Wasserman district has a port Jacksonville with DeSantis has a port Tampa I'm not sure who's Tampa but there's gonna be a port there I think obviously Long Beach is gonna be a port Seattle's gonna have a port * If you look at the actual companies that I believe Imran's father created with the in his FARA registration--they're all ports most of them except there's a few little rocks but they're mostly ports they're all Navy and ports * So anyway this ports thing is going to become very very important no pun intended * And again for for exactly this reason you're gonna see this weapons kind of deal car and weapons deal in all the ports * So this is the key drill down for any of the port cities * Any of the BlackBerry 20 that have a port this is gonna be a key thing going on here * I'm not sure if Greg Meeks in New York five has a port or not * But I know I'm thinking Anthony Weiner's old one was New York nine I think and then of course obviously Brooklyn Navy Yard this is the one I'm saying it's gonna have gonna have some stuff going on * So again I didn't I took the rap for you Imran * I want to be absolved this this had 4k they are gonna have DU weapons it is gonna be WP they are using the cars to ship it more and more evidence every day last night I felt like why am I in Yonkers * I should be down in Florida there's it was I was it was the Florida sweepstakes with all the AV companies coming in from different people * And I pushed all that stuff out on Twitter and you can see it all on Twitter but again all we have to do * Now is very simple matching game * We're down to what Bert Convy didn't he have that match game we're down to simply matching the ports to the crimes and * Now to the BlackBerry 20 guy and * Now we've got the blackberry 20 will come out very quickly from there * Chopra is really I do want to tell a hero's story here * The Chopras are the heroes the I believe because they won the right way in 2008 * They won the right way in 2012 they use technology to win the thing for Obama I think that's why he won * And they didn't want to get pushed out they were acting they were acting in the right * And they didn't want to see evil triumph * And I respect them for that * And the first set of leaks it's going to be through Tameen Javed * But the first set of leaks was all financial for that exact reason * So that people would see the financial malfeasance * And the second leak was more out of of just trying to clean out the evil * The evil this evil crime this evil SEIU crime that's invaded the Democratic Party * The first effort was to try to stop the crimes before they happened before the convention for Bernie * I admire you guys for doing that * The second one was a last-gasp hope because they thought Hillary was gonna win a last gasp of hope to take this the this this cancer * The SEIU cancer and I say that 1% of the SEIU Tonys is what I'm talking about I'm not talking about the SEIU rank-and-file * And that was why that Podesta leak happened * That was the Podesta leak it was to try to save the Democratic Party * So the Chopra's my hat's off to you no pun intended * But these are going to this story is going to come out and it is going to be what happened * So more and more information is coming out * Now about how this DNC/DCCC was directly connected the Awans's * &lt;&lt;&lt; DNC/DCCC Hack Cover Up Delated Until After Election &gt;&gt;&gt; * Directly connected to the Awans case now * You can see obviously here was delayed till after the election * They hope they wanted to get it through really quick, right? * Something happened something happened at what &lt;&lt;&lt; video cuts out &gt;&gt;&gt; --- * [The Compromised - The Blackberry 20 - YouTube](URL * Okay. good morning This is Day 302 I believe and this is a big one I have * So much stuff and then of course Britney blonde calls me this morning and she just got back from Portugal * So she has a ton of stuff * So it's kind of like what do I talk about there's * So much to talk about today I've just I've just decided I can't wait any longer on the the Congress again these are three rings that are on his server via Awan brother's server there's not only Congressional information but there's also the State Department information and there's also the CENTCOM information * Now what I will do is basically what I've offered numerous times is for people in Congress to come forward give me a little bit of that love from the CENTCOM information and we can go easy over on the Congress and I've said this like 50 times and no one believes * So what choice do I have other than to present a little bit more evidence about the Congress I'm sorry it's where most of my most of my contacts are * Now if you configure the other equation here that's probably going on we're deep alone is coming from we're deep BlackBerry's probably coming from and where some of the other people * Now coming forward are coming from is Petraeus has given those people up he wants this to go the way of the Congress can you see it * So it's probably your turn to give me a little bit more information okay * So and I know that sounds like a threat I'm not really trying to threaten anybody I'm a Democrat I don't want anybody to get hurt on the Democratic side I don't want the party to be destroyed by the a spy ring even though the Democrats have had this firing for 14 years there is a way out of this to slowly take the spiring out slowly get the I mean not we wouldn't do it slowly over as far as implementation but not * So it would hurt the political careers of everyone okay * So there you have it there's my offer to everyone in Congress especially the blackberry 20 and with no further ado I'm gonna talk about the BlackBerry 20 there's also gonna be a black there's also gonna be a State Department 20 and there's also going to be a CENTCOM I think it's more than 20 but at least 20 in CENTCOM that are gonna be compromised in these three rings * So we're just going to talk about that I'm gonna call the whole series the compromised and then the BlackBerry 20 is gonna be these Congressmen we're just gonna take one new one a day until till the trial the best thing to do here is bring out philippe brighness as email start dropping philippe brightnesses email to david petraeus and start dropping that email from SATCOM just one a day just go to your favorite journalist and start dropping some hints it would be my recommendation okay * So no further view that's kind of my message to Congress and that's kind of my message to the folks in the State Department State Department folks is kind of the same way you think you have covered because everything's kind of put under executive executive privilege under the india obama library but that is not the case not the case check it it didn't get the e5 all the stuff you think it's got the e5 doesn't have the e5 okay * Now I really want to start the show here this is the for the general audience that was just more for the folks in Congress and the folks at the State Department I know the CENTCOM folks are scared * So we'll go forward here this is a story about a target server that was collecting a whole bunch of information from three different parts of the government from the State Department from CENTCOM and potentially other military commands and also the US Congress it landed here in New York on Huma Abidine server Anthony Weiner was running the spy network with her Okay. that was the couple that's our famous couple *

Belvoir? - YouTube](URL * Okay. I think I'm live I'm not sure I don't have any viewers yet but I think I'm live * OK you are alive all right do I ever sleep no truth Never Sleeps right * So here's the story right * So much is happening I have to start ever I have started to fake these summaries every on the hour * But we're gonna we're gonna do that the good news here on tying together the car ring here we're gonna have some Alpha Jalloh information the weapons ring the Navy Yard Fort Belvoir we're gonna have that we're gonna have a whole bunch of stuff going to Imran's house here by seed they eat the CDW the supplier the IT equipment supplier * So we're gonna have stuff for espionage we're gonna have cash we're gonna have the seven mortgages on Imran's house 400k a pop most of them * So we gotta have something for everybody as I said we ran the board here I'm gonna leave the drugs off until we go a little bit deeper into the Navy Yard * But let's start with Imran's name * So I said about 150 days ago eImran his name was Shaheed Imran Awan and there was a deal here where his father stole the land from 12 farmers * I also said that he had put the partnership into a trust with his wife and his business partner * His wife was in name only he had his wife quote/unquote wife murdered in a car accident in a staged car accident * And you this will all come out * This is where Imran awan came to Faisalabad to be the big fixer the big fixer comes in he's gonna be the big fixer comes in with a big big police escort all kinds of pomp and circumstance big fixture coming in big White House fixer coming in * So anyway Shaheed Imran Awan I think it his name is Shaheed Imran Awan because here is the complaint filed by his stepmother I think she would know who he is Mr. Shaheed and Imran Awan * Mr. Shaheed Imran Awan former Pakistani he put stuff underneath the kitchen for listening devices etc etc * So I don't think I'm wrong here * I think Bole di Jhuggi all your investment out there folks in the Bole di Jhuggi has paid off Okay. * And I do believe a Children's Hospital is being built there * I do believe they are doing quarter quarter and half weight drugs manufacturing somewhere near the Children's Hospital near the Kashmir well I haven't located the place where they're making me where they're making the drugs yet * But anyway so let's get the name of this gonna be slightly obscured but it's gonna be there's * So many Twitter's * Now for the stuff I tweeted out this is one it's it's covering this part of the screen * Mohammed it's gonna be Abid Irfan there it is a fan or a fan are our Irfan or fan a beader fan of course they're not related as I said Abid is not related to Imran I wasn't sure if they're the same person but I knew they weren't related * So again this is gonna be tremendously helpful for people doing research this is Luka Rosiak's article yesterday * This is Yvette Clarke she has the old Anthony Weiner district this article came out saying that basically there was 120 K right off what happened was in Ron bought a hundred and fifty iPads and and 150 iPads and iPhones about February 2016 had him delivered to his home guess what home is that's gonna be? * All you viewers out there that's gonna be Hawkshead * So now we have invoices galore and I believe it's her chief of staff which is Davis the old chief of staff they switched chief of staff's in February 2016 and the new chief of staff just flagged it again this is when this information comes out * I don't want again this is the Clintons throwing and Petraeus throwing people of color in front of the bus throwing people of color in there in the way of their crimes * Throwing people of color in front of their crimes * Forcing people of color like the Black Caucus to be the middlemen and the the people who get taken down * Again not much unlike the clockwork oranges that they run in and the ratlines that run in the our major cities * Not much unlike that at all but here you can read this article by Luke Rosiak Democrats approve of 120k right off you're gonna see that that's * The scam was buying $500 items and then doping them and then making up the difference in contract service contracts * So here we go here's the report that I mentioned yesterday the 20 page report that's already being leaked * It's leaking in Washington right now well I wouldn't say the leaking it's more like a fountain at Bethesda Fountain * Just think Bethesda Fountain that you saw yesterday that I did a piece on that's what this paid this report is doing right * Now in Washington CDW invoices are going to be literally wallpapering the street here * You're going to be able to pave the street with see that CDW invoice is going to the nine six six seven Hawkshead drive and of course this is just me force this all started when I visited Mr. Andre Taggart on April the 10th 2017 identified with the Marine standing there on the doorstep * The pile pile PIL a pile of Blackberries government laptops and hard drives * I now believe with this new information that there was a turnover of all the Apple turnover to Apple products in February of 2016 and there was a leftover store of Blackberries that were that then then being reused these doped Blackberries were then being reused with people in the State Department CENTCOM as well as other Congressional positions ok * So we identified the hard drive successfully that broke this story open * And yesterday I published the seven mortgages also on this house for most of them being 400k year after year after year * We identified at the Kansas City banks that were involved in that we identified wright-patterson Air Force Base and credit union as part of this scam * And we identified Mr. Alpha Jalloh going going back and forth back and forth back and forth between New York and Kansas City working with those banks anyway if you read the article you'll see 150 BlackBerry replacements this was the February 2016 delivery CDW is completely cooperating completely cooperating with all the invoices to this house over the last since 2008 and they are going back as far as mm and I want to say for two the Thomas Drive house * So folks now's not the time now it's not the time to be on the wrong side of this come forward now * The chief of staff back here that Clark's chief of staff that did come forward knowing that this thing is collapsing made a very wise decision * Now she's a part of the team she's a part of the people that are trying to solve this thing and * Now we can I forget her name but it's not Davis it's the person Davis refused comment but again people of color being thrown under the bus Human shields * These are Human shields * These are Huma shields these people were brought into the Congress supported under the auspices that they have to be carriers they had to carry these Blackberries which is just horrible it's it's almost like hazing on the first day or some kind of horrible initiation on the first day of your college to make sure that you're your you'll always be dedicated to a crime scene syndicate * So if the Fox reporter that I gave the name of Andre Taggart to miss Zimmerman and Malia Zimmerman out of DC * Here's your chance to interview Andre Taggert you want to interview him now, before the CDW and invoices come out, or after the CDW invoices come out? * You may want to rethink the hit piece * You just might want to rethink the hit piece * So here is the Mike Kempner running thinks through Hillary, forcing kind of this poor woman here Debbie Wasserman-Schultz to do all these long * I'm covering the microphone again darn it probably can't hear me shoot can anybody hear me can everybody hear me blueberry pancakes yes make blueberry pancakes drain yes drain the swamp isn't that great how her name is draining the swamp yeah she can hear me drain the swamp is so beautiful of a name drain dra D R A N E * If Trump just tweeted out thank you to miss D R A N E for draining the swamp * Because like I said before it only showing the statutes yesterday with Thomas Paine statue in Bryant Park and then the statue two deep uranium in in Central Park you just knew another person would come forward * And she did and boom it just blew this story wide open * More is coming. Now is the right time to get on the right side of history * &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is 100 Watergates &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; * So here we go the original story to cover story for the mister Oh j-just wanted to be in this story * So badly Oh j-just wanted to be in this story and Kato Kaelin wanted to be in this story * So Kaelin we have Kaelin Kato Kaelin not Kato kill and we have Jim Kaelin Jim Kaelin Jim Kaelin who is tricking charges security at the chief administrator's office who wrote the kangaroo wrist slap * This is the kangaroo wrist slap that there was actually 20 burglaries of these somehow that actually Imran would have been able to go into 20 different homes steal 20 different Blackberries or iPhones * Now as the case may be and then somehow get them all back to him two days later yeah Kaito Kaito and well guess what Kaito also the person running report here about the Blackberries being stolen * He's also the person that's approving all the seven hundred thousand four hundred thousand dollar loans Imran Awan did * Well I'm sorry he runs he's the Board of Directors he's the head of the Board of Directors I wonder if he will call an inquiry by the FBI * So everyone says oh a mini internet pundits said that it wasn't even twenty that were burglarized, and I had greatly exaggerated the number two eighty, then I had moved the number to one hundred and fifty, and that was as of yesterday before the story broke it as a matter of fact it turns out that one hundred and fifty exactly * 150 exactly iPhones were purchased * Did I say the word exactly * I guess that goes out that's kind of a Goodman that's that's good for all men that's good for all the good news one fitty * Amy Goodman I was referring to * One fitty in the city one fitty it's gonna be more than that * Now it's gonna be bore that met when the Inter-American story breaks * Did you hear that one out there in California the Inter-American story breaks * So keep those cards and letters come into that Trello board it's looking good * So I'm sorry I'm having a little bit of fun here this morning because vindication is so much fun * So anyway as I mentioned here this is New York v Greg Meeks now's your time to come forward * Here's district 9 this is C Evette Clark's district that used to be Anthony Weiner's district Davis was I believe that cos there this has been going on since 2004 potentially 2001 did you hear that up there folks 2001 Inter-american * So okay this story is going to break it's going to happen don't be the last guy on the bus because you will be thrown under the bus under the bus * So here we go there was one Internet pundit out there saying that he wasn't a goof and if any Weiner wasn't a goof * He actually ran of a spy ring I ran of a spy ring him Boom Bang and the State Department will be included in this * Make sure you watch those CDW invoices before you answer the question before you go into the FBI interview and before you sign your 302 * Before you sign your 302 * CENTCOM get ready to have some visitors from Washington DC down there in Tampa * Alph Jalloh well it turns out maybe there are some connections brainy blonde is on the case one day back in the United States and she's all over the case is Mohammed is Alpha Jalloh actually Mohammed Barry? * Are they making fun of Barry? * They making it fun of Obama? * Hmm well we'll see I don't know * Is Alpha Jalloh Mohammed Barry? * Did he live with Imran Awan? Hard to say * Hard to say well brainy blondes on the case * So I'm sure she'll get back with us on that one boom chugga-lugga * Now let's go to the Navy Yard the Navy Yard * Let's go to the Navy Yard let's go to the Navy Yard let's go to the Dell server in the Navy Yard * You notice how I've had it as a Dell server for over 100 days BlackBerry Enterprise Server * And let's figure out where it is right? * Would NGA Statistics tell that remember ones Hillary's spread the data spread the data to five different agencies NSA CIA ODNI, the FBI and one other one but and I think she actually gave query access to 17 different agencies * But at least five have it now. At least five know the model number from the CWD they know the MAC address of that internet interface did I say interface * So they will be able to monitor all traffic to and from that device the only thing we need to know right now is * Is it at the Navy Yard as I've said before or did it spend some time at Fort Belvoir Belvoir * So that's the question today all is good here sorry to get a get everyone up so early in the morning but so much * So much news broke this morning that I had to had to get on it * Now speaking of Debbie Wasserman-Schultz there's also an article that I cannot find that talks about her admitting that Imran had classified material shipped to his home * So I cannot find that article for the life of me I sit came up on my notifications this morning * But then I can't I can't find it exactly * So if anybody has that I'd really be it's something like Debbie Wasserman-Schultz admits classified equipment was shipped to Iran's home why does she have to say that she has to say that because the CDW story broke^^[[a1]](URL * Now these these are invoices trucks drive along UPS trucks and they have GPS as on them * So there's like beaucoup metadata for this kind of thing * For all these truck trips okay * So then there's CDW has the thing where they an agreement with I believe UPS and FedEx * When they do idea equipment that goes bleak * So that it was delivered * So they'll know exactly exactly what time these were delivered okay * So just if if you're out there Malia Zimmerman just keep that in mind when you're constructing I said keep that in mind when you're about interview Andre Taggart * Okay. That's all for this morning there's * So much happening I'll have to probably come back a little bit later today but enjoy enjoy enjoy enjoy * This is happening I am gonna go to five * If I don't get some cooperation from New York five * I have to go with the JFK stuff guys * So I'm not trying to hurt anybody and I do realize it Hillary threw people of color in front of the bus * She's hiding behind people of color she's using people of color as a Human shield * So I don't want to do this I don't want people calling you to be thrown under the bus here * Okay.

to be going to a broadcast schedule of broadcasting every two hours much like CNN I think CNN's every hour but because there is * So much late-breaking news in this story we'll probably have to go to a bi hourly broadcast schedule * We'll see what happens if we have to go to an hourly schedule as we move forward through this story * It's moving very quickly as I mentioned this morning at the five o'clock show we have cash weapons cars and espionage all happening simultaneously * The other piece to this may be homes in terms of the cash here we found the seven different mortgages that were on the Lorton home of Imran Awan the Linette home * The Linette home just around the corners about ready to come into play and we're gonna have other homes gonna be coming into play as we roll forward * We're also looking at a swap arrangement between cars in the homes where the illegal home loans from the Federal credit union there the Congressional fred or con fed as they like to call it it's actually named after wright-patterson and wright-patterson I think it's an Oakland Virginia Confed which is headed up by mr kato kaelin not kato not kato kaelin it's headed up by Mr. Jim Kaelin yes * So it looks like they may be getting cash from Home Loans buying cars then taking those the stealing cars excuse me taking them to the Midwest using the cash there to purchase the the cars for the for the to pay the people who have stolen the cars * And then to sell them in luxury car lots and then bring them back steal cars in the Midwest and then bring them back to the East Coast * So we are running all that down Brainy blonde has many connections between Alpha Jalloh and they are ones * Now with potentially alpha Jolla living under a pseudonym named Mohammed at Bari and there are several Bari brothers they're going to be living with Imran and this car ring we'll get to that a little bit * First we have to go to the Congressional Federal Credit Union scandal which is probably top of mind right * Now as Washington braces for the impact of the Congressional Federal Credit Union investigations * Of course if you haven't seen Luke rosy ah he's been on the morning shows this morning he's talking about the CDW story the CDW story is obviously breaking this story wide open and of course it's confirming everything I had said about Andre Taggard about this home being in the storehouse the key storehouse for all Congressional classified in equipment it turns out that this has not only been used since 2008 but the CDW story confirms that a hundred and fifty iPhones were purchased right before the election actually right before the primaries really got going for all probably most of the Congress we don't know exactly the bills of sale which Congressman got their new iPhone but all you have to do is Google your favorite Congressman that's in the SEIU kind of sanctuary cities the heavily Democratic areas and then just see when they talk about iPhone on their Twitter feed you'll feel you'll see that a lot of them changed out their BlackBerry's for iPhones of February 2016 notice * Now we're * Now on the other side with the ax wands we're on the other side of the DNC scandal we're on the other side of the DNC scandal that's the important thing to notice here just yesterday just yesterday Fox and Friends they were saying and Luke unfortunately was saying that this was not connected to the DNC this was not connected to the Dietrich see one day one day talking to the different people out there talking to them about coming forward one day later we have * Now moved the timeline to before the DNC to before the DNC convention and really before even the DNC theft with act blue before this DNC fishing scheme that was initiated by the ax wants which still hasn't come forward yet that's coming forward soon again if you if your name is Melissa if your name is Melissa Zimmerman and you work in you work at Fox be careful when you try to set up an interview with Andre Taggert be careful what you say because there's interviews there's invoices excuse me for all the things for all the shipments that came in to this house CDW and then there's going to be GPS tracking for all the UPS and FedEx trucks that come to this location * So if you're concocting a hit piece and trying to do with Andrew Taggert here Andre Taggert be careful because you there's a lot of metadata here a lot of metadata Okay. just throw a little helpful hinder helpful hindrance I should say probably already it's a helpful word to the wise * Again seven mortgages here Malia Zimmerman you're more than welcome to cover that story today if you would like and talk about the Congressional Credit Union and how the number of homes is more like a a dozen Okay. this is the wright-patterson Congressional Federal Credit Union fraud * Here's credit union times apparently only small newspapers that are trade pubs can actually cover huge scandals that are actually happening on Capitol Hill and here you all you have to do is connect the dots on two different things here's Kaelin member kaelan member kato kaelin member Jim Kalin * Jim Kaelin here is saying goodbye saying goodbye to Charles Malan * Why is he saying goodbye to Charles Malan here in December well because there was a Congressional investigation that was start by mr. Kaelin as the new CEO of the Congressional Federal Credit Union right * And in that investigation guess who was questioned? Imran and Abid Awan * And you're gonna see again so many Twitter feeds here that we can't see the fact that Debbie Wasserman-Schultz was the key to that investigation and I believe I do believe I do believe that the whited out names of the different seven mortgages that I put out especially the first one especially the first one is going to involve not only PNC Bank not only Bank of America but not only this Credit Union here the wright-patterson crack Congressional credit union but a couple of banks in Kansas City a couple of banks in Kansas City * So now all of those people who need to new learn 12-bar blues and they want an easy song to learn Kansas City here I come * And that's gonna be our new watchword Kansas City here I come Kansas City Kansas City here I come and you have a couple of banks down in Kansas City involved in this fraud * And there's gonna be one more hidden royalty hidden royalty and Kabini will be coming to the fore here and the hidden credit union that I reported on yesterday you can go to Twitter to see those seven just seven loans year after year four hundred thousand dollar loans on that Lordan Virginia property * Okay. you're gonna have Linette Linette Linette is gonna be the house right around the corner and you're gonna have that being involved as well okay * So who is Jim Kaelin here's Jim Kaelin looks like he's gonna be more of a good guy here than a bad guy * Now what we're not gonna go let Jim Kalyn get away with I believe he's a Democrat it is a cover-up even though he's doing the right thing even though he's saying hey got to get this mortgage fraud thing ended * This 20 page report everyone in America needs to see the 20 page report the cockamamie story of the twenty Blackberries all being said my family simultaneously stolen from Congress * We need to get that report the there's no way just this should not be front page news FBI report with hourly press conferences * Hourly press conferences saying here's what we found we're gonna dispatch someone to the president we're gonna drive up from down from Capitol Hill over to the White House we're gonna give them hourly updates personal hourly updates on this on this scandal * We have no idea this isn't just a credit union scandal we also have selling secrets * Now we're gonna have a spy car theft ring * Now we're gonna have a selling satellite secrets * Hourly updates we should be having Okay. if they don't have somebody at the in Washington wants to do it just let me know and I'll do it on the hour * You watched earlier at the 5:00 a.m. show you saw that Shaheed Imran Awan is indeed the name that I reported correctly for the Bole di Jhuggies story * That's the story of the Faisalabad farmers the 12 of them that were defrauded by Imran Awan's father Amran Awans father yeah his name at that time was shit Mohammad a Shah well it was Mohammed A Awan but he changed his name to Sha so that no one could follow him in the United States after you defrauded 12 farmers who stole all their land * And the woman he involved in the scheme he killed in a car accident in a fake car accident * We're gonna get back to that story later but you can see here the stepmother seems to think that Shaheed Imran Awan is the name of Shahid Imran Awan * So we're going to move right along we're gonna name the other Abid Awan excuse me Abid Awan is actually Mohammad Irfan * I'm sorry there's so much Twitter going on or fun IRF aan Mohammad a bead orphan IRF a.m. Okay. and here again this is the father filling out the form for life insurance right and I got all the Social Security numbers right by the way for all the awards that I published about 90 days ago * And boom here is that article that I talked about this is Miss Yates all right excuse me Sharyl forgetting the name right now in New York to nine New York nine Anthony Weiner's old district Anthony Weiner's old district help me out here Cheryl * But anyway her administrator drain although she didn't say anything about Imran buying his hundred and fifty iPhones and iPads initially for to replace these Blackberries * And what do you think happened when when Imran brought all these Blackberries back to the house and brought it to that downstairs rack through the baby back door, through the baby back door right * What do you think he did was think he threw them all away knowing that these could be used to compromise other people other carriers and Congress other people too State Department other people that said come you think he threw them all away? * Think he threw them all away? well we'll see Okay. * That's coming Jim Kaelin could leak a little bit more of this report little by little too Luke Rosiak in order to stave off the wild-eyed public that wants answers that has heated up and just whipped up and stirred up emotionally * Whipped up by right-wing conspiracy theorists that give to Bernie Sanders five times and work phone banks for Bernie Sanders like me like me * So Jim I think it's time for few more leaks code going to Mr. Luke Rosiak okay * So here we go again was it twenty burglaries was it eighty Democrats like Daily Caller later reported some people have reported thirty carriers in Congress these are people carrying Blackberries and when they carry the blackberry they're immediately sinking to M Rana once server which immediately is * Now there's a Dropbox which goes to Pakistan and * Now it goes to Pakistan to the IT company nanotech we think we've identified a server in Pakistan where that's going but anyway there's a running argument was it 20 burglaries 20 simultaneous burglaries how many people were carriers some say 60 some say 30 some say 40 some say 80 I said 150 yesterday and ding-ding-ding I get the prize, because it was actually a hundred and fifty that Imran 150 iPhones and iPads in Iran bought to replace the Blackberries when they cut over * So this is district 5 this is Greg Meeks his district the guy who has the huge mansion in the Queens the guy who has contacts - well I won't say much more other than I'll just say the word ED * Anyway this is where Cheryl is from Yvette Yvette Yvette [Clark] and I can't remember her last name * Now all of a sudden she took over for anthing weiners Brooklyn 9 here * So anyway Weiner is gonna be at the center of all this this was run out of Brooklyn 9 before Yvette took over her chief of his chief of staff was named Davis I believe Davis was his chief of staff as well Davis was the one who who processed all this stuff basically what they did was they had a $500 limit * So they could keep buying stuff under the $500 limit and then they could wipe it away as incidentals * But the problem surfaced when the when the I phone became popular and became more than $500 became $800 * So they kept having to buy the iPhones at $4.99 and then make it up on the service plan in order to get the doping * Their greed will lead to their downfall * For the 300 dollars difference between a blackberry and an iPhone was the thing that led to the downfall of this particular CDW scandal * So that is coming Weiner ran the spy ring with Blackberries since 2001 * Perhaps earlier in 1999 with Inter-american there I said it again Okay. * Alpha Jalloh is that really Muhammad burry well brandy Vaughn thinks * So we'll see if she's right we'll keep following that story we're gonna keep following the banking part of this story and the money-laundering part of this story we believe that maybe * Now Brooklyn 9 is involved a bank in Brooklyn 9 Bank of Brooklyn perhaps we'll see then there's two Kansas City banks that were following as well for the cars for homes swap deal ok cars for homes * So and then finally we're chasing down this server this blackberry server if it went to the Navy Yard * Now remember Imran's getting all these BlackBerry's all this all these Blackberries are reporting back phoning home here to Imrans's house * Was the big kahuna server at Imran's house it wasn't reported to me by Andre and Andre Taggart when I talked to him on April the 10th that it's home there's a router there and I'm just wondering if this router doesn't route to Fort Belvoir or or to the Navy Yard * But once it hits that Navy Network that dark network it's gone once it hits the Onion Router it's gone there's no there's no chasing it after that even with the secret or whatever that's secure like Quinn Michael was talking about the secure protocol * I think it's I think it's gone * Now the key question is is there a handshake is there a handshake between them router that the supposedly printer router and the Navy Yard router or wherever the edge network is for the Navy Yard or felt Fort Belvoir the closest point of presence would need to seem seemingly need to do some kind of handshake between Imran's house and the point of presence wherever the local point of presence was * Now I don't know this is a question for Quinn if there is a handshake beyond the normal tcp/ip handshake NHS GPS HTTPS or whatever as you build the handshake between the servers * I don't know they answer that question and if it is an onion router is there some additional secure protocol handshake then it needs to go through * That I just don't know the question to * But if we could look at those log files for Imran sarau tur and again I'm scratch I'm combing my hair in SA I'm combing my hair if there is a handshake to The Onion Router then that puts us into the Navy Network either at the Navy Yard or Fort Belvoir which is I believe a Marine base ok * So one day ago or two days ago we were saying there's no connection to DNC * Now a day later CDW * Now we're at in February * Now three three months or four months before the DNC convention * The timeline has already moved back it is going to be the Awans's that did the DCCC hack * It is going to be the reason why they gave all those phones was because they I believe they put genie on there and I can't remember the last part of the genie program this * The key logger product that goes on the genie but someone was a Pakistani guy was arrested for it by Mike even McCabe made an announcement Imran I just can't remember the name of the genie program righ Now * Okay. That's it for this morning's show here at 7 o'clock we'll keep you updated as the day continues on with all the fast breaking news here at the Situation Room --- * [304.1 DU Cars From VA Drive To SC, Ride To FL, Pick Up WP For Ride To Port Of Jacksonville? - YouTube](URL * Okay. Hello everyone this is the Situation Room and I am NOT Wolf Blitzer but I have late-breaking information that just may happen to be true based on fact rather than fusion GPS dossier is called otherwise known as a peepee dossier * So let's see if folks are receiving this yeah great thank you * So this is going to be speculative or conjecture it's not conjecture but it's speculative based on several interviews and I have had this is going to talk about the port situation and * So it's a little bit more speculative than what we've been doing dealing with this morning with the credit union and just all kinds of just hard evidence mounting that there's all kinds of fraud happening with Imran Awan of the Congressional Credit Union as well as all kinds of doped Blackberries and dealing in IT equipment that could be involved in selling state secrets this is the weapon ring piece of this * So I know this is the the car theft ring which is basically just a vehicle for the shipping the D U and W P weapons is the certainly the most unbelievable part of this story if the evidence didn't keep coming just on this kind of continual basis day after day after day I would have dropped this story long ago but it just keeps presenting itself and since I seem to be the only person connecting these dots I'm gonna keep reporting it but there are other people that have reported parts of this story that I've said before and I'm always given them credit all along the way for all their excellent work and I will continue to do * So so with no further ado oops well there's why a single individual that is not a network right but Steve Bannon if you're out there my phone number * So let's go into this cash weapons cars espionage * So I just got tired and done talking to this reporter at length Adam Walser and I kind of explained this whole situation I said Adam he said what do you think is happening in the Port of Tampa he had done a series of reports in the Port of Tampa he had shown how Tampa's numbers were really low here 39,000 containers part of Jacksonville's numbers were really off the chart there about similar-sized what's going on at the port of Jacksonville why it was everything breaking toward the port of Jacksonville what I got next was a story that will just it just keeps getting crazier * What he told me was he we used to work at the Port of Mobile which is even a smaller port than the Port of Tampa * And he said we did a story 15 years ago called Target Mobile * I don't even know if that's people can still even google that anymore I think the television station doesn't even have that anymore but maybe somebody can google it * Anyway there was a security expert that was cited in the report I think his name is Demetrius Demetrius I'm not exactly sure I spelled Demetrios but what he said was if you were going to attack US ports this is 2004 this is right when Imran gets into the US House of Congress with top secret clearance * If you wanted to attack as a terrorist you would do it with containers depleted uranium containers depleted uranium and get this you would use diplomatic pouch diplomatic containers * Now that is a little bit hard to follow our fathom because it was exactly the same situation you can imagine me on the phone not knowing this person him not knowing anything about Charleston and Adam Walser the first thing he says is well I did a story on this Port of Tampa why is no traffic in Tampa why is everything going out of Jacksonville * And I said well I think I might have some information you are on Jacksonville because it was a a pair deal done by Jack Lew Department of Treasury with with Canaveral in Jacksonville * We had Jafar's nephew bragging with Bill Clinton that he had done a deal a secret deal with port of Jacksonville * It's like oh boy and then I had said Charleston * The port deepening project to Charleston the UAE contractor to get the money to kickback for the port of Charleston * He's like oh boy goes well that reminds me of another story * Anyway this Demetrios we'll get to how he's related to Lincoln Park I am NOT making this up I am NOT making this up * This is a Wired magazine article it's gonna we're gonna get to Linda and Chester Bennington in this story I am NOT making this up I will show you the articles Wired magazine Okay. Demetrios does to meet realistic gus demitriou guy ends up working on this story because it apparently what ends up happening is this guy this Lincoln Park guy is hacked and his PayPal account is hacked and all of his money basically is hacked and he goes in and he tries to find out who it is apparently some cyber stalker that is from Los Alamos New Mexico who is a whistleblower for uranium trade * Now I didn't get a chance to tell him because he was busy I mean he talked to me for a long time * But what I said a lot of the times what they'll do is they'll take a whistleblower like myself they'll say ok that's gonna be our new cyber hacker they'll turn the tables around on that guy and say he's the cyber hacker they'll clean out their accounts * They'll use singers or famous entertainers or people like Jeffrey Epstein these so-called billionaires they'll use their accounts to process funds to launder funds * Then when somebody calls it out like this lady for some reason from Los Alamos in looking at uranium trade looked at his accounts and said this is where they're processing the cash * I'm not making this up they're processing the cash from this chester bennington * So her theory was chester bennington is being used somebody's financial managers accounts and this illegal trade is being used * So when the thing is exposed they clear the accounts out to clean the accounts out and then they turn around blame the whistleblower * That is exactly what happened this lady apparently was cyberstalked summer stalked to death * The new dream AI I guess is the cyber stalking people and turning around the tables if they call out these black weapons trades * This black weapons trade please go to the wired article I could not believe myths when I read it it's just totally blew me away apparently this gus demitriou jimmy trealose is still quite active in security as security a guy * So I would like to get I would like to talk with him I'm sure he could be a good guest for crowdsource the truth or something like that if they wanted to pursue this dark weapons trade but you have to let go the fact that that's the trained that I just heard of whistle for the train might carry these cars that then carry D dark weapons * Because more and more information is coming out that that Alpha Jalloh indeed was selling cars * So that they could be loaded with the D U and then the cars were either being driven to the port of South Carolina for be put on diplomatic container ships or riding the auto train to Sanford Florida then being met in Orlando from Tampa, where the white phosphorus weapons would be loaded into Orlando and then driven to Jacksonville * Now this isn't a story of Adam Walser * Adam Walter my story doesn't seem as crazy and when what but Adam Walser is telling me this story where you kind of Demetrios is the guy's name I'm not making this up * So using these famous people to launder money and then if anybody ever comes up with it you blame the person who is the whistleblower, and then you clean the accounts out and you blame the whistleblower for cleaning the account out * &gt;&gt;&gt;CONT"
13,cyber-crime,TruthLeaks,What the Security State's Crypto Cracking and Forgery (QuantumInert Tecnologies) really Means for the future of Law [Opinion],2,6dob5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/TruthLeaks/comments/6dob5d/what_the_security_states_crypto_cracking_and/,2017-05-28 01:37:10,"I'll put it very simply: when you can't prove that data on your computer was something you meant to put there, then you have no means to defend yourself in court about the contents of your data storage devices. But it's a double edged sword--you also can't prove that it was or wasn't put there by a 3rd party interloper that intended to 'frame you'. Because you now have Vault7, Umbrage, QUANTUMINSERT and many other means of cryptoforgery by the deep state that demonstrate an 'extreme willingness' to target individuals and break the law. (see latest circa article on how the FBI had routinely done this...and of course, [this](URL It also means that your bitcoin is decreasingly secure because they can crack crypto if they target you hard enough. They don't have the power to do this to everyone, but they DO have the power to do this to a few people. So what cracking crypto, and having a bank of hackers that can intrude upon any device, trillions of YOUR dollars unknowingly and unwittingly spent to HACK: YOU, a team that can forge ANY digital signatures means that the security state and anyone associated within it has a plausible deniability for the contents they may have--if someone in their team is caught with pedo for instance, they can simply claim that their computer systems were hacked by an unknown third party because those hacking tools to intrude upon any system are now 'in the wild' (Vault7), which means they can't be held accountable for any contents But it works for individuals also. What they are essentially doing is creating a plausible deniability for EVERYONE who cares to use the excuse and is able to convince a judge or jury to have doubts about any accusations. That's it. In other words, when the state hacks crypto and intrudes every device and forges digital signatures, they can gaslight anyone, abuse anyone. But it also lets them get away with anything. Really this is the ultimate techno-fascism because we know that the judges in pedo cases assume you are guilty because you are accused. That's human nature it's an uphill battle to prove your innocence, but now that Vault7 is out there, you very likely CAN, it just will cost you Taking a step back, what this is is 2 things 1. ) A way for the courts to extort money from people who are gaslighted / framed up with pedo stuff through the costs incurred in the lawsuits and court systems...it's lawfare as citizen stalking 2. ) A way for the intelligence community and anyone ""on their good list"" (versus their naughty list (above, point #1)) can have a plausible deniability about any--even legit pedo stuff or snuff films--they are caught with Ultimately, degrading crypto by leveraging the vast disproportional computing power of the elite caste normalizes cyber crime, enables gaslighting and abuse of citizens. Ultimately, the implications for the law is that there is no justice, and there is no law. Once enough people figure this out, they will revolt, as we're seeing now. They did this to them.

14,cyber-crime,TruthLeaks,The Awan Brothers - Compromised at least 80 congressional computers and got paid 5 million to do it.

We may never know the extent of the breach PART 2 ###[The AWAN Brothers](URL After compromising the Congress' networks for 12 years they do a quick cleanup by breaking in to 20 congressional offices, store data in an off site server before running of to Pakistan and the D.C. Police are investigating. But wait there's more... The more I dig in to the story of the Awan brothers the bigger the breech appears to be. There is also their interaction with figures you all know. This is the real story, who were they working for, what did they steal, who covered for them, and where did they go... Before I get too far into this information I want to give credit to [Luke Rosiak](URL who has written a great series of pieces for the Daily Caller, and [George Webb](URL who has done a great [YouTube](URL series. Beyond the normal video usually posted George Webb asks his viewers to tweet and email representatives and media figures. If they get a barrage of mail they can't ignore the information. He has already got information read in to the congressional record and coverage from media personalities. Now before ya'll scream""Ya gots no proof,"" I will direct you to my [previous post](URL The information in that post comes from credible sources and is cited. While I will continue to cite my information there are some spots where I will be making logical leaps that as of yet I cannot prove. If you see flaws in the logic please post and I will address the issues. Louie Gohmert read a statement in to the congressional record. [Congressional Testimony about violations of cyber security and procurement scam. An abbreviated employment history of the Awan brothers](URL The only voices giving this story any attention are the keyboard warriors in reddit and videos like the ones George Webb has done. This story looks like it is bigger than the clinton server. I made some assumptions in this piece from the information available, but the MSM is doing their best to kill this story. u/911bodysnatchers322 was also picked up by investmentwatchblog.com with their piece [Who are the Awan IT Staff that hacked House Intelligence Computers? And Why Wont the Media cover this Evidence-based Story?](URL #So let's get in to the basics of the case.  The size and scope of the breach has various numbers in the reporting. It appears that the case is still expanding. This is why quoted text may have conflicting numbers. Earlier articles were still revealing the scope of the breach.  The numbers vary in the reporting but four Pakistani Brothers, Imran Awan, Abid Awan and Jamal Moiz Awan, and 2 wives get an IT job in Congress. Their has been some mention of a possible unrelated party involved as well. &gt;Additionally, it was revealed that these employees were paid more than three times the salary of a normal IT worker, grossing upwards of $5 million dollars combined during their tenure as IT professionals. While the average government IT professional earns about $55,000 per year, Imran Awan was being paid $165,130, Abid Awan grossed $164,980 per annum, and Jamal Awan $157,577 according to government records. &gt;Soon after Imran began working for members of Congress, Imrans and Abids wives  Hina Alvi and Natalia Sova  also began receiving [congressional paychecks](URL The DCNF found. Imrans employers included two members of the intelligence committee, Indiana Democrat Rep. Andre Carson and California Democrat Rep. Jackie Speier.  From 2004/2005 Imran and his brothers work their way in to Capitol Hill staffer jobs to an unspecified number of Congressmen. The reporting ranges from 30 to 80 depending on the article cited. It appears that about 30 representatives added the Awan brothers to their payroll, but they may have done associated and work for about 80 representatives. &gt;Imran Awan has a longtime relationship with some members of Congress, including working for Meeks and Becerra starting in 2004 and joining Wasserman Schultz's office in 2005. The IT staffer position expanded to include more than 30 representatives, including work under congressional members who were members of top secret level congressional committees (DHS, Foreign affairs, Select intelligence committee). &gt;Although personal office computers are not supposed to be used for Intelligence Committee business or classified material, [accessing these computers](URL is a high priority for foreign intelligence services because of the information they could glean about the committees work from unclassified emails. Their is contested information that the Awan brothers did get access to sensitive and classified information. While the emails and internal correspondence would be considered sensitive, but I have yet to confirm classified information was compromised, however a lot of circumstantial evidence prevent me from ruling out the possibility. The brothers are suspected of serious violations including accessing members computer networks without their knowledge and stealing equipment from Congress, over billing congress for work and parts, transferring data to a remote server, and bypassing normal security protocols for IT staff. Their Democrat benefactors allowed the breech of policy for the sake of convenience.  The Awans operated an external server, which is against all protocols concerning secured government information. &gt;Further, there were instances where [House information was discovered in an external cloud server](URL The contractors in question reportedly were sending and storing House-related information in that off-site server.  The Awans had special access to the White House and for Visas.  Multiple Democratic lawmakers have yet to cut ties with House staffers under criminal investigation for wide-ranging equipment and data theft. ``Imran Awan, a longtime House staffer who worked for more than two dozen Democrats since 2004, is still employed by Rep. Debbie Wasserman (As of March 5, 2017) In my first [article](URL I glossed over the kidnapping of the ""stepmother"" not understanding the significance of the event. When I read the [Fairfax County Police report](URL it just didn't grab my attention. One fact I missed was the use of electronic surveillance to control the movements and actions of the stepmother. I also failed to understand the Awan brothers were trying to gain access to funds in Pakistan. &gt;Congressional staffers allegedly held their stepmother in captivity with violent threats in a plan to use her to access money stashed away in the Middle East. The staffers are suspected of using their positions to enrich themselves.  &gt;They kept their stepmother in sort of illegal captivity from October 16, 2016 to February 2, the relative said, telling her they were in charge of her life and said she was not allowed to speak to anyone. The fact that she did not speak English made it easy for them to take advantage of her.  &gt;The brothers bugged her house with hidden listening devices and told her her movements were under constant surveillance and conversations within the house and over the telephone were being listened to. They would repeat what she had told people to prove that they were really listening.  &gt;But as soon as Shah passed away, they came into the house and whatever documents were there they stole, a couple laptops which were their fathers property, and left for Pakistan. ###And left for Pakistan... ###This article proves a number of things that should be explored. ###The first would be the use of surveillance equipment on the stepmother. Yes, I will concede that they could have bought the equipment to watch their stepmother, but I believe that is unlikely. The skills to run a surveillance operation are beyond most IT techs. It's not that they couldn't figure it out, they just wouldn't have the equipment. While the price is dropping, running an effective bugging operation is expensive and time consuming. Let's consider for they moment the brothers had the equipment for other jobs and repurposed the equipment for their surveillance of the stepmother. This brings us to the first logical leap... How many of you have used an in-line key logger? It's a simple, inexpensive device that can't be detected by antivirus software. It operates outside of the OS plugged into the USB port then the keyboard is plugged into the logger. The only real problem is obtaining access to deploy and recover the device. This brings us to the break ins. Why did the Awan brothers break in to 20+ Congressional offices when they already had full admin and remote access to the computers. It has already been proven they could access/edit/delete all the Congressmen's email, files, everything. It is even possible to remotely format a system. They could even transfer data to a remote off site server. There was no reason to break in to the offices to recover data, so what were they after? I believe it was to recover something other than data. It only stands to reason they had to recover surveillance equipment and or Spyware installed in the offices and systems. They were running a bugging operation on congress and had to retrieve the equipment before they lost access to it. #The second is why did they run? Here is the second logical leap. They began controlling the movement of their stepmother on the 16th of October, 2016. No one at least in the Democrat party even entertained the possibility hillary would not be the next president. Even the pro Trump supporters had to admit he was a long shot until 9pm on election night. Almost everybody believed hillary would win and the bodies would stay buried forever. Imran was familiar with the clintons and it has been reported Imran was quite friendly with bill clinton. He was about to dramatically expand his sphere of influence. The Awan brothers had no obvious reason for consolidating their assets and running to Pakistan. They began their consolidation of assets some time before October 16th. This implies planning and fore thought. They knew something was coming. What could have been lucrative enough or dangerous enough to have caused the need to pack up shop and get out of town Was it the health of their father that caused the need to control the family assets? They were clearly attempting to get control of the father's, Muhammad Shah, assets and power of attorney here and later in Pakistan to ""inherit"" the family assets, but that would not have been cause to run. They could have acquired the assets and remained in the United States. It has already been shown they had enough clout to get past any problems the stepmother could have caused. That would not have required a break in to 20 congressional offices and a complete exodus of the United States. In view of the events we know that was an exaggerated response to events, or something else had to change. Was it the DNC hack? The wikileaks of email systems they protected? Was it the proposed changes to the security clearance for staffers that made them run? Could it have been the new policy of FBI background checks for staffers and the request for a Top Secret/Compartmentalized information request for investigation of staffers attached to the Congressional Intelligence Committee. Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and Rep. Jackie Speier recommended the Awan Brothers for their positions and asked for their [TOP SECRET (TS/SCI) CLEARANCE](URL This .pdf is a request for a budget addition of $125,000 to conduct background investigations for the highest level of top secret/compartmentalized information (TS/SCI) clearance for Intelligence committee staffers. This is speculation, but the Awan brothers were getting the brass ring. They had access to congressional data that would only increase with the clearance. This brings in an angle of the story I had found little published information on Nanoset Technologies, but what has been reported in r/TruthLeaks is the beginning of something solid on the Awan brothers web of business interests. ###Nanoset Technologies &gt;Nanoset Technologies were a government contractor that sells IT equipment to the government, but the Awans were officers in that company while they were staff, which is a conflict-of-interest {{ But it's also a way to get equipment with backdoors into the Congress }}  &gt;There is a well-known Bangladeshi doctor at the VA in Baltimore, MD [name redacted]. She was living with the Awans, and was doing business with the Awans--an odd mix of IT and Medicine. She became a CEO of Nanoset Technology while she was an MD at the VA, and the business listed is just a condo. How much biz did they do with the US Government? This would have been very lucrative for their business and open a whole new horizon of contacts and government pork they could bid on, why would the run? What would the investigation turn up? I have to admit I don't know the answer here, but it doesn't make sense. What I do know is we have not been provided a good reason for why they were planning their escape to Pakistan prior to October 16th, 2016. #The Security Clearance Prior to 2017 IT Staff could get access to Congressional computers systems with a simple FBI background check. Members of Congress could pencil whip this if they vouched for the staffer. [Do Members of Congress Have Security Clearances?](URL House and Senate staff members with a need to access classified information are required to obtain security clearances. The Office of Senate Security and Office of House Security, respectively, have oversight over the security clearance process for congressional staffers, and background investigations are conducted by the FBI. [Another Major Democratic Email Scandal the News Media is Ignoring](URL &gt;According to the [CIAs Center for the Study of Intelligence](URL There are no written rules, agreed to by both branches, governing what intelligence will be shared with the Hill or how it will be handled. The current system is entirely the product of experience, shaped by the needs and concerns of both branches over the last 20 years.  &gt;The House reportedly only required background investigations of House IT staff in 2016. These investigations were to be applied retroactively to existing House IT staff unless a member signed a waiver attesting to their trustworthiness and judgment. ###Is the FBI investigating this case? No, it was found to be in the Jurisdiction of the D.C. Capitol Police. As had been stated the U.S. Capitol Police are investigating the break ins of the congressional offices. Despite [Paul Ryan's](URL assurances, I wont speak to the nature of their investigation, but theyre getting the kind of technical assistance they need to do that, this is under an active criminal investigation"", How is D.C. Capitol Police the best investigative force to work the case? Are they actually better suited to investigate a Congressional Cyber Security Breach and track the suspects guilty of the Federal crime [18 U.S.C.  371Conspiracy to Defraud the United States](URL and, or apprehend the subjects in Pakistan? Despite media claims that no Classified material was compromised, if the information Idaho Republican [Rep. Raul Labrador](URL is correct when he said, ""This is pretty outrageous. These are people who had direct connections and access to the House, to intelligence information,... This is actually something that could directly affect the national security of the United States, and I have seen very little reporting, and apparently, the Democrats are not that interested. An argument could also be made that the Awan brothers violated [18 U.S. Code  793 - Gathering, transmitting or losing defense information](URL I'm not a lawyer, but it looks more and more like a federal case. If so, then why are D.C. Capitol Police investigating a crime that could have tremendous scope? So while [The FBI Is Building a National Watchlist That Gives Companies Real-Time Updates on Employees](URL for the rest of us, the word of a Congressional Representative who was also grandfathered a clearance just for getting in to the club can also recommend their staff for clearances. I understand elections have consequences, and our representatives need access to make informed legislative decisions, but through a funded campaign literally anyone can get a clearance. Like an enemy intelligence services wouldn't try to run for congress. At least a spy would have a better criminal record that many members of Congress. My point is the staff needs additional scrutiny and changes to staffing policy might need to be addressed. The staff doesn't need to be trusted by the representative, they need to be trusted by the country. In the corporate world, if the staff covers up crimes committed by the CEO they go to jail, but in Washington it seems to be a job requirement. ###Could a Foreign Intelligence Service be Involved? If so, Which One? Is it so hard to believe the very capable ISI could have sent in operatives to infiltrate the Congressional Intelligence committee. After breaking in to 20 congressional offices and leaving the United States under suspicious circumstances, is it absurd to consider a foreign intelligence agency might be attempting to compromise the House Intelligence Committee. We're building a circumstantial case but there is no meat on it. Where is the connection to the ISI, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Iranians? Where is the connection to any extremists? ###The following are informed guessing. I haven't found direct evidence to support this speculation, but have seen [circumstantial evidence](URL that points strongly towards ties to a larger group. I'm including this section primarily to elicit responses from you, the reader. I'm looking for direction and leads for the next article. Help me out and tell me what you think. [Another Major Democratic Email Scandal the News Media Is Ignoring](URL &gt;Were these IT staffers part of a plot by foreign actors to penetrate the House of Representatives and its computers? There has been speculation by some conservative journalists and experts that they may have had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. A former CIA officer told me she worries that the three Awad brothers, who reportedly are Pakistani immigrants, may have ties to the Pakistani intelligence service, ISI. While the political and faction associations are very fluid and complicated in the Middle East, it can be boiled down to [Shia and Sunni](URL interests in a very Broad sense. Iran and Syria are Shia while Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Pakistan are Sunni and they are fighting for control of the new Caliphate. [This is very broad and in its application difficult](URL but essentially true. This Why it is important to identify the players. Could the Awan brothers have been working for the ISI or Iran? This would also provide some insight to the motivation of the theft of data. Were the Awan brothers supplying information to Iranians during the nuclear talks? That would really define their motives, but we are left with more questions than answers. [Syria's Other Foreign Fighters: Iran's Afghan and Pakistani Mercenaries](URL &gt;A major reason for the disparity is that most accounts of the Afghan and Pakistani troops fighting under the Hezbollah flag in Syria mistakenly tend to minimize their ideological motivations. However, the Shia foreign fighter phenomenon could have serious ramifications for South Asia, because it serves as a pretense under which Tehran trains and indoctrinates militant Shia populations.  Enter Dr. Ali al-Attar, an Iraqi political figure who allegedly has connections to Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed terrorist group. While this is not an overt connection, but much like political corruption, individuals committing these types of crimes attempt to be careful. While many ultimately fail, they think through their moves and are harder to catch. Most complicated crimes, organized crime, financial crimes, computer crimes, are not discovered through direct evidence, but are uncovered through a [pattern of behavior](URL Remember they got Al Capone for tax evasion not boot legging or murder. &gt;Update: New concerns that this may have been an attempt by a foreign Jihadist organization to penetrate the House computer system arose this week in reports by The Daily Caller and The Daily Signal that the Awan brothers owed money to Dr. Ali al-Attar, an Iraqi political figure who allegedly has connections to Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed terrorist group. ###Who Is Ali A. Al-Attar, M.D The first thing that comes up is he was [suspended](URL Proxy Highlight) from practicing medicine - Maryland Board of Physicians charged Ali A. Al-Attar, M.D., a physician licensed to practice medicine in the State of Maryland. Dr . Al-Attar's failure to cooperate with the Board investigation was said to be deliberate by the board. Currently Dr. Ali al-Attar is wanted for tax evasion and defrauding [the medicare system](URL After losing his medical license in November of 2010 Al-Attar got to know the Awan brothers well enough to provide them an unsecured loan for $100,000. I'm sensing a relationship there. &gt;[Philip Giraldi](URL a former Central Intelligence Agency officer, wrote that Dr. Ali Al-Attar was observed in Beirut, Lebanon conversing with a Hezbollah official in 2012shortly after the loan was made. While Al-Attar was born in Iraq his parents were Iranian. At various times during the Bush administration, beginning in 2002, Al-Attar met with then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz along with a cadre of other Iraqi dissidents opposed to [Saddam Hussein](URL to discuss the war, Al-Attar has also been accused of helping provoke the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. Between 2002 and 2012 Al-Attar became disaffected with American actions in Iraq and began to formulate plans with Hezbollah. This would be reasonable considering his Iranian heritage. How does this bring Al-Attar and the Awan brothers together. This is another fact I glossed over not understanding the true significance of the brothers car dealership Cars International A, LLC, referred to as CIA in court documents. [How Radical Islam Penetrated The U.S. House of Representatives](URL &gt;And it is very interesting how the car dealerships finances were strangely interwoven with those of the U.S. House of Representatives. A car-dealing associate who was owed money by the brothers, Rao Abbas, also a Muslim, was placed on the congressional payroll. &gt;Abbas is listed as the IT professional for former Democratic Representative Patrick Murphy, a then-member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and its Subcommittee on Department of Defense, Intelligence and Overhead Architecture and (irony alert) Subcommittee on the NSA and Cybersecurity. Imran actually got Democratic Representative Patrick Murphy to place Rao Abbasi on his payroll. It is likely that Rao simply ran the dealership and got paid for being a part of the Awan crew. This seems like fraud to me. Isn't the FBI supposed to ask politicians about the misappropriation of funds? We'll come back to Rao in a moment. &gt;Imram later acted as [owner since CIA](URL was considered family business by the Awans, Abids one-time business partner, Nasir Khattak, said in court documents. The car dealerships finances consisted of byzantine transfers in which staff and cars were often swapped between it and a dealership next door, Khattak said. Lets look again at the car dealership, CIA (Cars International A). The records show a [confusing tangle of sales](URL and trades, but despite the 5 million the brothers took in from their work as congressional staffers, the brothers were constantly in debt. Imran brought in about 150 grand a year between himself and the 2 wives also brought in 6 figure salaries. Now we have Hezbollah-Connected Dr. Al-Attar putting cash in to the dealership after fleeing the country. At about the same time he is meeting with a Hezbollah leader, and Hezbollah gets busted for laundering drug money with used cars and consumer goods from China. The documentation for the business was in shambles and Imran maintained control of the dealers license. In essence, Imran was able to front for Hezbollah in their auto trading. Also while heavily in debt Imran was able to mass a portfolio of real estate properties. &gt;In addition to his other jobs, [Imran is a real estate agent](URL and Khattak is also a realtor who obtained the cash from Al-Attar and passed it through bank accounts used for real estate deals in Fairfax County, Va. &gt;Having lost my and Abids collective investment of $500k due to Awans mismanagement, [CIA] was further in debt $400k to other creditors, Khattak said in a lawsuit. While it is obvious Imran had some fairly sloppy business practices and was predatory to his partners he also was well suited to launder funds for Hezbollah. Imran had obtained the licenses necessary to support what had by this time become a model for moving money throughout the world. Several arrests have been made showing Hezbollah buys used American cars, ships them to Africa for sale or trade for drugs. At the same time Chinese consumer goods are being shipped to South America to trade for drugs in South America. Money is made from the transport and sale of drugs in to Europe from South America and Africa. The profits are then used to buy more vehicles in North America and consumer goods in China. The money is then laundered by banks like the Lebanese Canadian Bank with some of the money being siphoned off to pay for further terrorist activities. Beyond supporting their terrorist activities they also expand their allies and support in Africa, Central, and South America creating an international presence. It may be a coincidence that Imrans businesses model gots ideally in to the current standard fir money laundering by Hezbollah, but it is an amazing coincidence if it was accidental. ###[Hezbollah laundered money with used-car sales, U.S. says](URL &gt;NEW YORK (Bloomberg) -- Lebanese Canadian Bank and two Lebanese exchange houses helped launder more than $480 million for the Hezbollah terrorist group in a scheme that involved buying and selling used cars, the U.S. said in a civil complaint today. &gt;Federal prosecutors filed a lawsuit in Manhattan claiming the defendants took money from Lebanon to buy used cars in the U.S. and sell them in West Africa. Here is where I begin to speculate. Imran, at this point, has infiltrated or highest levels of security and at the very least has the ability to run the most compromising surveillance operation of the Democrat party, the Congress, the United States government and intelligence initiatives in history. The story of the break-ins makes the hillary server small potatoes. hillary may have opened foggy bottom to the world while she was sec state, but the Awan brothers gave congress to the Iranians, the Pakistanis, or given his predatory business practices, both of them. Then while Imran is compromising Congress he also builds a business that integrates perfectly in to Hezbollah's business model. What if Al-Attar was a fictional partner. The Keiser Sosei as it were for the business. Insane right? There is no way it's possible the business partner who hasn't been seen in the United States since 2010 didn't even exist right. The money trail is there. There are documents, loans, paperwork. Are you sure? [EXCLUSIVE: House Dem IT Guys In Security Probe Secretly Took $100K In Iraqi Money](URL &gt;Abid claimed the Iraqi doctor may never have existed. If as suspected, all of this is a charade, particularly if it is learned the mysterious Dr. Al-Attar doesnt exist or didnt sign the documents, then the whole matter rises to a higher level, he said in court documents. ###I want you to remember as quoted above... &gt;Abbas is listed as the IT professional for former Democratic Representative Patrick Murphy, a then-member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and its Subcommittee on Department of Defense, Intelligence and Overhead Architecture and (irony alert) Subcommittee on the NSA and Cybersecurity. &gt;By 2009, the family was simultaneously managing a full-time car dealership in Virginia, with Abid running day-to-day operations after contributing $250,000 in startup cash. It was called Cars International A, LLC, referred to as CIA in court documents. &gt;Imran boasted unusual clout among House Democrats, and was even pictured conversing with former President Bill Clinton. After Rao Abbas, who was owed money by the dealership, threatened to sue amid allegations of deception and theft, Abbas appeared on the congressional payroll and received $250,000 in taxpayer payments. ###And Debbie Wasserman Schultz refuses to fire Imran Awan. What's going on here? Imran is still on Debbie Wasserman Schultz's payroll as a [consultant](URL Wasn't Imran at IT consultant? His access to the House of Representatives and more importantly the House computer systems has been revoked. What exactly is Imran consulting on? I'm sorry I don't have answers for this one, but it definitely makes no sense. This anomaly is so strange it requires more investigation. #Where are we at so far? We have 4 brothers and 2 wives start doing work for congress. Imran gets a job with Rep Gregory Meeks. The next year he also getting Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Jackie Speers to put him on their payroll. From there he manages to work in his brothers and Rao Abbasi on to the congressional payroll for an, as of yet, unspecified number of Congressmen (Somewhere above 30) Imran is pulling down somewhere around $150,000 and the others are getting between $100,000 and $150,000 apiece. Three times the normal salary for other staffers. How ya feelin' about your tax dollars now? Most likely, the brothers ran a social engineering hack to bypass security protocols and compromised congressional data security. What does that mean? They asked for passwords and access to computer systems and networks, and their congressional clients handed them the access. Additionally they most likely ran a surveillance operation and compromised a number Congressional Representatives. The brothers also established the frame work for Hezbollah to launder money for various items including narcotics to fund world wide operations. Either they did support Hezbollah or stumbled on the perfect operation. Incidentally the operation is perfect for support for Iranian intelligence to follow the progress of the Iranian deal. Yes, I know Imran arrived in 2005, but these operations progress and evolve as opportunities present themselves. No one knew how [Valerie Jarrett](URL obama's senior advisor, was born in Iran and maintained ties to Iran and CPUSA. The presumed next administration, hillary, had [Huma Abidin](URL She has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, a Sunni group. Remember Iran, Shia, and the Saudis, Sunni, the Muslim Brotherhood are fighting for control of the Middle East. Now ask yourself why the Awan brothers were booking it to Iran before October 16th, 2016. This is supposition, but the pieces really look like they could fit. Especially if we have not entirely understood the nuances of the operation. This looks very similar to Russian operations exposed in the [Venona papers](URL and books like [Black Listed by History](URL by M. Stanton Evans. A great read if your in to true Capitol Hill intrigue. McCarthy wasn't the man you think he was. I bring this up because these operations are much like the Cold War Era KGB Ops. Funny how the Iranians cozy up to the Russians and an intelligence operation that had their fingerprints all over it resembles something the GRU or FSB would roll out. All of the facts in the piece are true and cited from news sources. Many of them were in several sources, however, a lot of the conclusions in this piece are suppositions, but they do fit together nicely. Each piece is supported and sets the foundation for the next piece. That is really what makes it work. I didn't know the answer when I started this piece. The facts drew me from one conclusion to the next. I am not posting this as truth, but asking for peer review. What do you think? r/CoincidenceTheorist -23-"

The Nazis had this, before the Jewish harvest, and it fed directly into the medical program [Lebensborn]. * George supposes that the Operation Paperclip's Nazi [Lebensborn] medical program never changed --- * [[**Day 111 part 1**]](URL * Data Driven Journalism piece.

Mutation of Pax2 gene, Joest-Degen Bodies. A lot of these kids are turning up with this eye defect. The chances are 3-5 in 100,000. George believes the mutation is from a virus * Ernst Joest for whom Joes-Degen bodies are named, studied at Univeristy of Dresden, University of Leipzig; he of Malta, and the Pope and got [illegal] passports and [Nazi doctors were smuggled] all over the world to Argentina. And they set up these weird colonies where there's a lot of girls and one priest, and one priest impregnates all the girls. It's a kind of genetic experiment. * ***The film *The Colony* is about this--about how the Nazis were trying to create a new Germany in Argentina. How could we use viruses to kill off all the population and then have this new population resistant to the virus surface, type of sick thinking.*** * Yesterday when I said they Bombed Dresden and Pirna to [cover up] these weird types of experiments, and it wasn't for no reason there was a huge allied bombing. * The Nazi drug trials--they tried everything. These drug companies (IGFarben) worked directly with the Rockefeller foundation. Kaiser Wilhem instutute in Berlin--which was the center for eugenic thinking--was part built by at least half by the Rockefellers and also the Rothschilds * They were infecting people with viruses to see new strains of viruses and test the vaccines. Although these drug trials were horrible, they were a for-profit motive [and a national security motive] * ""Sonnestein Euthenasia Center. Pirna, Germany Set up by Karl Brandt"" * NAZI POSTER: ""60,000 deutsh mark to take care of one disabled person"" -- to guilt you into going along with eugenics; they say they didn't round up disabled people but....here's the poster. 70,000 people were killed in Sonnestein Euthenasia center. * I am wondering if the eye defect is a type of Nazi marker that can go on for generations. You can tell that grandchildren are yours by their defect. * Eugenics, ghoulish nighmare, dystopian vision of the world, that if they ever came out of the colonies they'd be able to identify all their children. * To add to intrigue here, supposedly at the centers, [children were] fathered by Hitler's inner circle. Kindergardens at Auchewitz, Dachau, Buchenwald and Ravensbrook, they weren't random servants they were girlfriends of Nazi high command, like Karl Brandt--Hitler's physician. This kind of colony approach to the death camps. * There are folks in the pizzagate world saying ""what's this all about?"" That's where the Hillary connection comes in with John Podesta. They use the Catholic Church *to 'diaspora'* (spread genetics far and wide) these folks around the world. So they needed a way of keeping track of them. And (I think) Podesta was one of those find-it men. * I realize this is an extreme topic. But the reason why these kids are valuable now is that their hearts and kidneys, their organs are a perfect genetic match going back to the father. This is the idea of Charles Lindberg having the 7 kids and so forth. I know it's a stretch. I know it's an outside possibility, but I wanted to give this to Pizzagate folks and have them drill down on what kind of experiments Mengele did with this virus that's called BVD Bornavirus Disease --- * [[**Day 112 part 2**]](URL * Quick proof of life -- Melissa Mccarthy did a funny Sean Spicer last night (SNL) * George noticed how the Dyncorp set of investments were like the old portfolio of the drug portfolio of IGFarben-Rockefeller joint venture * If Wall Street put all that money into those joint ventures for a better and higher use--for petroleum basically--then why would they throw it all away at the end of the war? * Then it makes perfect sense why *Operation Paperclip* happened and why the CIA created Dyncorp. Because bioweapons and human testing was morally reprehensible so they needed a 3rd party to do that. It's the same reason that sex trafficking and organ harvesting are run through DynCorp. * If you look at the Rockefeller banks and hospitals you have this repeating pattern, using the Pinkertons to clear the land---and once you get the land, then you do the human trafficking, the drug trafficking, now the opiods. It's a repeating pattern over and over. * Then placing secret armies with weapons caches in all these different countries--the Gladio program--is this other repeating pattern. Sibel Edmonds talks about this [Gladio II]. * Josephy Corbell--Madeline Albreight's dad--was the Gladio guy for Czechoslovakia, posing as a priest had an arms cache in the church. * Allen Dulles was using the *Salvation Army* as a front for the *Gladio* Program. Reminds me of how they compromised the Catholic priests in order to stow children at the orphanages at the Catholic Church * Again I ask the question: if the CIA is reallY DynCorp and DynCorp is really the old Wall St.-Pinkertons-Rockefeller program, would they do 191 countries around the world and then just forget about the United States, and just say well we'll that one alone? Doesn't seem like that would be the case. --- * [[**Day 113 part 1**]](URL * Quick recap of the toppling, ratlines, and how Palantir manages it * What allowed Hillary to go around the Congress, Senate Intelligence Committees, and House Intelligence Committees was spying. Tyler Drumheller was the key person in Osprey Global along with General Grange and Sid Blumenthal that enabled that to happen. * This happened 10 days ago, but and IT spy ring of 3 muslim brothers living in the same house was busted in Congress. Marie Bartaromo with that story. * Three brothers were able to be in the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the Dept Homeland Security Committee and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs-- the three key intelligence committees in the House. * HPSCI oversees the CIA, Homeland Security, ODNI, all the Military Intelligence agencies, 22 agencies it oversees. There were about 8 congresspeople involved in these hacks * Awan brothers--all under 22 years of age, and all making 160k/yr. Jamal Awan. * Haven't heard much about this in the press, a little on Barney and on Lou Dobbs. * This is equivalent to the Rosenbergs; they put the Rosenbergs to death, so I don't know why there hasn't been any arrests been made. They were fired from their jobs but they were caught hacking into these 8 representatives' accounts: Duckworth, Carson, Schult, Castro, Richmond, Frankel, Spier, ? (what's the eighth?). That's espionage act. That's death sentence. * Adam Schiff didn't say anything, CNN didn't say anything. * Ranking member of the Republican Congress in the House is @devinNunes. George asks people to send this video to devinNunes on Twitter. * Again, our enemies have more information than what's going on in our government than we do as citizens. This is further exemplified by the 650k emails * If you can circumvent the government with these 19 gmail accounts, then the enemies know more than the American public * We know these went to Israel Russia and China; but if the three brothers talk at all--all in the same house I assume they would, that means the intelligence is going to the Muslim Brotherhood. This is recent as in a couple of days ago. * The Muslim Brotherhood of those 32 countries now has that intelligence, so we need to know now more than ever those 650k emails. Families could be travelling, on business trips in these other countries and need to make informed decisions. * Not releasing this information is several felony violations of Federal Records Act ""CTC, D&amp;D"" * According to McCabe, it's going to take the FBI 5 yrs to process the 650k emails, but it's ok to let three treasonous Muslims take all the date from the 3 top Intelligence Agencies to the Muslim Brotherhood in 32 countries * This is beyond a National Security question, this is a failure of 3 branches of government * The address is @DevinNunes, he is the chairman, ranking member of the HPSCI * @DevinNunes needs to get on CNN to counterpoint Adam Schiff * Going after Assange, I think we have to go after Awan brothers equally--this is a hanging offense: ""Equal Protection Under the Law"" --- * [[**Day 113 part 2**]](URL * Trafficking networks are being exposed in a limited way, because if you don't expose in a limited way it goes all the way to the top, to Pug Winokur and that would totally stop it. * They get these guys in a room and they say, ""It's going to be 30 yrs if you squawk about the trafficking ring and how many people are involved, or it's going to be a year and a half of weekend jail if you don't. And if you keep persisting then you end up being thrown off a bridge or you die in a helicopter crash."" These guys play rough, it's Dyncorp for a reason. * The viruses they can always say, ""well you can't really prove that"", but trafficking and harvesting have very provable rings and all you need are 1-2 witnesses * For instance the coverup of the operation underground railroad that Beck took care of in Haiti. It's basically a red team from kissingers old red team days. Very thinly veiled with this social justice cover. It's a setup for DHS to do stings on unsuspecting guys trying to get them to go for younger and younger girls over time. It's an asset forfeiture ring. * Beck said 33 saved and 12 arrested at Kaliko beach club--he didnt mention anythign about a woman being shot in the head in front of other women? Was that because the woman was shot as a message to other women not to talk about the johns going over to Mirabalais for harvesting / processing? * Once the women get the men on film, that's all they need with the Nepalese police force at Mirabalais in order to say, ""ok, you can harvest him"" -- to the catfood factory he goes * Some people are saying, ""Man you're accusing the Clintons of some really weird stuff!"" * This is Dr. Guy Theodore, Hospital Bienfaisance (charity in french) in Pignon Haiti -- he got set up there by the Clintons. Here he is at little Rock air force base at 1983. Why do I say Clintons may be involved in organ harvesting, they were very involved in blood mining. If you know this investigative reporter Kelly Duda, he wrote a documentary called Factor 8--he's from ARkansas. This is what caused the HIV/Red Cross blood crisis of the mid-1980s, using all these patients' blood from the Arkansas prison system, HepC and HIV * When Hillary is first lady in 1998 she goes down to Haiti with George Soros after one of the storms (Haiti Bienfaisance)--she was shadow secretary of state--she also goes to various other central and s. american countries on that same trip. This is a swing through of all of the franchises. The best I can compare this to is a baseball league. Epstein is going to be major leagues, the AAA clubs the AA clubs and it's going to be all these things. * Haiti Bienfaisance is an orphanage and a hospital where you're going to have a weeding system in place (filtering); you'll see this in all orphanage/hospital combos. Maybe it started out mining the bone marrow from the dead bodies, but the problem with harvesting is that [the profit motive causes] you to make earlier calls on end-of-life. I started out having angels of death showing up in your order release because it is a valuable product. People start dying around when people need transplants. It's a slippery slope. As bodies become more valuable, then this activity provides a bad incentive for health. * Dr. Robert Ashton just jumped off the George Washington Bridge. He was married to this Jennifer Ashton, the medical correspondent on ABC News. He was involved in the Bronx transplant (organ transportation) center. The Bronx is where they are getting the hearts--he's a cardiac surgeon. If you want to target someone like this, you first break up their marriage. He goes to a conference, you send in the girl, you take the pictures, you get the pictures to the wife, she wants a divorce, now your life is ruined, and now he jumps off the GW bridge. * The other way to get rid of a doctor: get a witness against him. Take this case of the helicopter crash 5 yrs ago. This is the Mayo clininc in jacksonville Fla. What they do is take these three guys, profusion specialist, cardiac surgeon, ex old navy seal guy and say 'there's a heart down in Gainsville. Just reading 3rd party news stories I see that this lands in the woods that the helicopter would have gone if it had gone straight, but instead it lands in the woods, way off track. When these networks come to light, these are different ways you can suppress the witness, kill the witness. {{I think George is saying that Ashton had those 3 guys killed because one was a witness with blackmail leverage against him for illegal heart dealings. Not entirely sure}} * If we are going to give access to three muslim brothers the Awan brothers in the muslim brothers, three 22 yr old living in the same house in DC, give them access to all this information AND MORE, then why wouldn't the American people have a right to that information? Release the 650,000 emails! * [[**Day 113 part 3**]](URL * Proof of Life * The Awan brother I spoke about this morning -- they may have been the ones that tipped off ISIS in Yemen and that may have caused the death of the Navy Seal, so it's very good that at least we found this leak early rather than having to wait. * Keep sending @DevinNunes, the head of the house foreign intelligence committee, we really need arrests--I can't believe this wouldn't be espionage--death penalty, like the Rosenbergs got the electric chair --- * [[**Day 114 part 1**]](URL * I wanted to talk more about what I call the ""Dyncorp Sheriff"" -- this new phenom from these wars in Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, Afg., Haiti, there are these Dyncorp sheriffs being created from these mercenaries that were overseas training these police forces, and it's taking a militaristic turn. * Kathryn Bolkovac was a police officer in Dyncorp in Kosovo (""the Whistleblower"") made many accusations about the prostitution and sex trafficking by Dyncorp staff * Flint Chambers Orders 15 Yr Old Lap Dances at DynCorp -- Hillary Clinton seemed to be very interested in that particular email * Several articles have been written about Dyncorp getting in trouble around the world in this area * Article title: ""Prisoner says warren county jailers raped her, nurses refused to give her epilepsy medication"" -- she claims she was raped by 2 deputies at the insistence of a 3rd deputy on the floor on top of a garbage bag. Again, it would seem the deputies were forced into raping the girl. * Film: Trafficked / Lots of movies being made about this 'pattern' * Bob Mosier -- Faquier county (double-entendre of 'f*ck here', though George puts it more nicely) -- a rural county just west of DC. A lot of folks take their kids to Fuquier county to go to the roller rink or the farm day sort of thing. Lots of weird messages in far of those social media, lots of things to 'touch', boy scouts day. Check out the roller rink that's closing--those attractions tend to close when these investigations start. * I noticed on his resume that he's still working for DOD, worked for Dept of State, International Justice Mission where they save children, and then finally was a law enforcement technical advisor for DynCorp from 2001-2007, then there's an interesting insertion in this gap -- from 1996-1997 was in Bosnia -- the gap was 1997-2001 I wonder what he was doing in these 4 yrs. He was the culpepper county sheriff but lists it from 1998-2015. So was he sheriff while he was overseas, which is interesting because Culpepper county is in Virginia, not Libya; maybe it's a lend-lease program where they come and go * George discusses post yugoslavian countries, * And then notes that ""the Whistleblower"" was about where this sheriff was stationed--George asks the question: does DynCorp Sheriff Bob Mosier know Kathryn Bolkovac? {the plot thickents} * In the news the [Oroville] dam burst yesterday in the county just south of Sheriff Lopey's Siskiyou County, so I'm sure he's helping with Oroville, which I thank him very much for. But he also did these Weed wars. He's an ex-Dyncorp employee, but he does have this habit of doing these very militaristic raids. I just wondered if Sheriff Lopey knows Bob Mosier. That's my question for the day. * To follow up on another story, Glenn Beck went down to Haiti with a 3rd party NGO called Operation Underground Railroad to investigate human trafficking--turns out it's a bunch of Navy Seals led by Tim Ballard and they had a bust where they busted people at Kaliko Beach Club. * I've been in conversation with Vince Depatie and he's got good information for my next show. --- * [[**Day 114 part 2**]](URL * This is going to be a catchup on the virus * Timothy Alefantis has a virus/vaccine company called Vitalprobe that we'll get to * There was a drug arrest made between Colombia and Haiti so that's obviously a drug route * Big news is Joe Clancy has stepped down from the Secret Service * In previous episodes Clancy and McCabe had this agreement where the Secret Service were used in nighttime intrusion teams called ""prowler teams"". And now we've got 2-3 prowler teams that are talking and feeding information to Trump, the sneakernet thing with the screens and blind interviews. It will be interesting to see how Sessions deals with this. * If you're going to spy on someone like General Flynn then dont' use your own resources, use the Secret Service as an espionage shield {McCabe sneakiness}, they also have extensive cyber hacking capabilities. They also have a means to inhibit tracking of secret service personnel who are moonlighting on these teams. Trump is going to clean that up I'm sure, depending on who he names as the new SS guy. * Letter that Chaffetz sent on Jan 27 to the FBI that says, ""I want the 650k emails by Feb 10th"" -- that has come and gone and wasn't answered. That's another thwarting of the executive there. At least they could have produced the metadata. If there is a response, it would be nice to get Chaffetz to just respond by saying ""metadata""--that could not possibly be state secrets * Trump is against the wall now. They just took out Flynn. McCabe's illegal surveillance took out Flynn, so it's now or never. * Decameron Hotels in Haiti which I said was the funnel where Hillary's putting USAID money and the money from sex, drug, trafficking ops are going into these hotels. I specifically mentioned SEMEX. * Turns out Decameron started out in Bogota as a money funnel for the drug business in Colombia through 44 hotels 12k employees. * The Decameron hotel group ceo died oddly enough during a heart transplant operation (2015)^^[[]](URL * 34 americans here and 33 girls, and the girls are brought in one at time so no one would notice. Each american paired with a girl: wouldn't a girl be uncomfortable with that--with a stranger? * 12 people were arrested * The above is Vince Depatie's testimony * After the raid the other americans stayed there but left the next morning and didn't pay their bill * I think its interesting there were 20-21 other Americans involved but that weren't arrested. * Asked him for the names, said the hotel would not give them * What I'm saying about these Dyncorp Sheriffs that went to Bosnia and Kosovo where all these bad things happened. I'm saying this is being put on them by the State Dept and the CIA. * When I mentioned Bob Mosier was in Virginia a little west of DC, everything exploded on my comments * One of the bioweapons developed by Tim Alefantis of VitalProbes is Anthrax. They also have a lab an office in Florida. * AeroMD -- an ICU in the air * ""Girls 11, and 12, Shot in the head in separate Chicago shootings"" -- both are braindead--they went off to a children's hospital.

That the kids in body bags are shipped back to Duke Medical to see how the vaccine did. * **Satanic stuff is always a cover---people are going to get mad at me for saying this.** * The vaccine programs and testing is going to make dead bodies so you have to have an explanation to people and they are more willing to accept satanic explanations * It's all part of a spying ring: Dyncorp is going to be economic spying, military planning and policing --- * [[**Day 88 pt2**]](URL * George had a long conversation with Sy Hersh.

I apologize in advance. --- * [[**Day 77**]](URL * Asking about Steve Pieczenik--*is it true there is a counter-coup?* * Whenever I hear this, I pause and find out he's saying the same things Im saying, which scares me * Give a litmus test to discover if there really is a counter-coup * **Trump is the first president ever to come into an active coup that is very well financed and has help from the best military planner (Petraeus) in history--he makes war go as long as possible** * Sinaloa warriors in sanctuary cities will use normal people as human shields to create more counterinsurgency DISRUPT / OTPOR, to try to turn opinion against Trump * Counterinsurgency is to outgun them; then the counterintelligence approach, which is to covertly infiltrate their weapons depots and blow up their stingers * Hillary has already infiltrated the FBI and she can have the FBI use selective obstructionism to inhibit him (COMEY / MCCABE) * All the advantages of JTTF are not available to Trump but are available to Hillary * Plus you have this covert police force that can do these ops around the the country * Hacking different targets is *""variation for effect""* * This whole idea of boxing Trump in and eventually he will be frustrated and lash out and the media will go after him * Immediately publish the 650k emails. It's not just about justice, it's about National Security and survival. We are otherwise enabling the coup. * The only way to operate a counterintelligence plan is simply releasing information, then the hidden network becomes available * *Classic obstruction means they are against you.* * Litmus tests: Will [Trump] send 200 agents to Haiti and the Caracol industrial park? If not, we have a coup * If James Comey releases all his old Marc Rich legal files without redactions, then that's a litmus test. If he doesn't, then we have a coup. * Let's look at the information that the Chinese hackers got. Let's publish what they took. Not the plans but the metadata. If he publishes, then that's a litmus test. * ***Trump needs to know about this DISRUPTion plan, PDD-62, otherwise it will be used against him*** * Disruption starts small and snowballs, gets on film, then on the media, etc. Trump needs to know about the Disruption campaign. * Publish the account numbers and the transfer amounts to HSBC. Another litmus test. If Al Copone has a bootlegging gang and you catch them you publish it, you don't protect them!! But these hidden donors are hiding al copones. --- * [[**Day 77 pt2**]](URL * Oil and mineral partnerships sold at the CFR with information from world bank conferences with infrastructure builders * Brown is a ***NOC - Non-official Covert Officer***, a CIA position, a completely fabricated life, a makeover.

I couldn't say that [NOC, that Neil Brown is a NOC] before today. * PM of Croatia is sad because he lost the South Stream pipeline * You'll always going to see the hot blonde next to the PM, that's going to be the Valier Plame in this instance * You figure out where the pipelines need to be, you line up the politicians and generals and if they don't play ball then you bomb them. * You need these NOC to get the generals to go to these parties and you either compromise the general through Brownstone operations or you get them to be a partner in the pipeline and various arms deals * ""Sorry Neil, I gave you chances to come forward."" * Once you get the common thread it all comes together. It all goes back to oil deals in CFR * The human trafficking is the other side of the business * ***Hillary is not trying to create a coup to take over the US--I hope I didn't give that impression***, &lt;&lt;&lt;Yeah, you did&gt;&gt;&gt; * ***Instead she's trying keep Trump boxed in with the domestic agenda, so that she can continue to do these secret oil deals in China, to get him worried about the sanctuary cities and so forth*** * The drones should be patrolling for Trump and the US, not for Henry Kissinger * If you ever studied Kissinger, it's secret pipeline after secret pipeline. If you see him shaking hands, start looking beneath the water for a secret pipeline&lt;&lt;&lt;LOL&gt;&gt;&gt; * KKR and Venado Oil and Gas Announce Eagle Ford Partnership: What's going on with this drilling under the gulf. Trump is smart to have Tillerson, because he knows about this. Question is now will Tillerson tell Trump?? * If Trump does an arctic deal with Russia then there's no leverage left for the middle east. * Trump needs to get the navy drones looking for the secret Haitian pipeline * ***The litmus test to know if FBI is on Trump's side is for the FBI to publish the 650k emails and the 1100 secret donors to the Clinton Foundation. All the old Marc Rich documents, all the Huma, Clinton, Quid Pro Quo (Comey/McCabe/Kadzik/Podesta) emails, Fast and Furious, IRS--- WITHOUT REDACTION*** * ***Otherwise you have a secret, shadow government, a shadow STATE department, Beacon Global drawing up secret pipelines and secret oil agreements. Emails show you the connection*** * Just do metadata for the classified ones on 650k emails * The only way to stop the Shadow Government is to stop their oil and take their money. * Trump could do a raid on the Guistra partnership and find the owners and their accounts; problem with that is that the FBI has already put PALANTIR [Enterprise management] software out there to guard those accounts, and the softare can give notifications as a kind of 'early warning system', which means they'd scramble to hide their monies. * 6.5T Missing from the US Treasury and you know you had 3 secret programs going through the Treasury...then you have the destruction of evidence related to the secret programs, the first thing you do is call an audit: where did this money go. If this money goes then your whole Gladio B goes to pieces, and the whole coup loses it's energy. --- * [[**Day 77 pt3**]](URL * I give people incremental information to maintain credibility, so you have a chance to google things * The CIA spends an incredible amount of money on oil and mineral education on the NOCs, so they know what information is most vital to steal, basically. They are economic spies. * Play ball or it's ""Stinger time"" * Eric Braverman, you're going to find is a NOC as well, those of you who guessed that, you're correct. * Bechtel is quietly in the corner. They are kind of the master of ceremonies for the Construction contractors and subcontractors. A lot of NOCs are created out of Bechtel. Valerie Plame is probably a Bechtel person. * You are going to find Neil Brown, Eric Braverman, and Kissinger in these oil conferences * ***In counterintelligence, Hillary always copies what George Bush has done.

Check her out * Oil and gas plays will come out with the revelations of the hidden 1100 donors. * Adriatic pipeline is going to be a big play (DISRUPTION NEAR GREECE IS COMING) * FBI has asset forfeiture is to take their CIA cut; the torture is to get info * A soon as Trump figures out there are secret pipelines in the S. China sea, he's going to check it out. * Trump has the power now to do the triple checking * Mexico is going to pay for the wall now because they want to keep the tunnels. * Trump needs to publish the papers for Fast and Furious * Same for Haiti, track down the missing 6B and you'll unravel the USAID slavery / microloansharking plans --- * [[**Day 77 pt4**]](URL -- Questions for STEVE PIECZENIK * Steve Pieczenik Tweeted a George Webb Video * Asked him [{on Twitter?}]: ***""Steve are you an agent for the CFR and also for Trump?""*** * I want to ask a question about an Israeli rumor, ***""Do you remember the Darmour massacre in Lebanon?^^[[]](URL And there were a lot French diplomats and French businesspeople that had coastal villas in Darmour, and a group of ""I won't say"" invaded the town and killed a bunch of men, women and children.

It's a church commission thing. * Pike commission?? Documents could be revealed by Trump * At the end of the day, the country Topples are simply bank robberies; the cost is kids losing their hands or being sold out as sex slaves; where the NOCs become economic spy units * **""This type of corruption doesn't get better by itself. It's a cancer""** * All this criminality, 33 yrs ago, Marc Rich was one year into the money laundering. Rudy had him on 65 counts of tax evasion. All this criminality would have been avoided if we had gone after him and not let him slip through our fingers. * ***The assistant director of the FBI (Andrew McCabe) is openly snubbing the Congress, trying to shut down the investigation of Huma, Hillary.*** * There are no checks and balances anymore. * Look at how these plans have evolved: 52 gas attacks in syria, probably hundreds by now -- * These were just plans to get rid of Hillary's enemies. First she used Bill's influence to get rid of enemies in arkansas, then it went national and now it's gone international. * 50 Agents attacking the head of the house oversight committee DURING TESTIMONY for him asking a simple question of the Secret Service. George implies that now they are attacking our own government who are charged with doing oversights * 2009 the F35 Hack, we didn't stop it, so they kept on doing these 'cyber attacks' * Hillary is going to continue to pursue the ""hate archive"" unless we get those emails. * ""Good people"" are affected and have to do these coverups. Obama and his crew have to cover up for Hillary's activities [because they enable her and don't stop her] * 650k emails are out there * FBI has a chance here to not go down with the ship, and announce the classified material, publish the metadata, publishing the gmailed accounts that are not classified in plaintext. * ""I'm trying to help"" --- * [[**Day 78 pt2**]](URL * A lot of people want to know why I started this series and when I started it. * I started it around Day 8 * Go back to day 60 if you want to go in depth * Braverman went to the Russian embassy on Oct 23rd of 2016, and had another meeting scheduled on the 30th which he didn't show for.

Mccabe from the FBI whose done a lot of {{illegal}} wiretaps * Today's tweetstorm dedication is Brigitte Gabriel @ACTBrigitte -- she made famous this Muslim Brotherhood plan for N. America in 1991. After the fall of the SU they had this Muslim Brotherhood--they called it the mujahadeen then--they needed to move it around to different parts of Europe to break off different pieces of Russia. They also had a plan for doing the same in America through this Gulen Movement. So I thought she would be interested in this series. * Yesterday stepmom recap; She called Jan 2 which caused the whole Awan spy ring to come apart. They fled to Pakistan. If you look at Imrad's website you see all this radical Pakistani rhetoric and radicalism. His father, I believe is Pir Mohammed Shah * There is a picture of a ticket that looks like Imrad was taking for a train that he put on his facebook * Meeks is who installed them in 2004 * The VISAs are going to be from the white house * This finally hit big time news yesterday--CNN was all over this story--all the major outlets. They almost seem to be following {{LOL}}. * CENDYN is in a joint-venture with KKR -- they are the ones who control this Trump email domain. * KKR had a footprint right inside the Trump tower. THey didn't need to hack, with a CIA van parked outside {{with dipshts-in-black holding mini satellite dish guns aimed at at an office...lol}}. * The CIA hacking tools, 100B dollars of them are 'out there' * Awan brothers already HAVE the tools, but wikileaks doesn't know where they are getting their leaks from. They don't knwo if CIA is leaking or Assad or Russians... But the CIA needed to get a cover to say, ""hey, tools like UMBRAGE are out there"". * UMBRAGE creates Russian footprints. It's a russian hacking tool that was modified by the CIA to leave on a system--Like Trump Tower--what looks like Russian Footprints [on the hosts it hacks] * I don't know who is running the information ops, but You're basically giving the answer to the whole Trump tower hack by the Awans, basically giving the recipe out. * We've got spies coming into these safe houses. Lorton VA home. They are bringing in different experts. Lightbridge and the defense contractor people coming in, who are trained on espionage technologies. * Again if you have [inside actors embedded in the house (ie: SPIES), behind security firewalls] then you don't need a FISA court/warrant * There might ever be a FISA warrant ever produced. {{in other words, FISA is for *legal* domestic espionage. 5th columners, double agents are for illegal domestic spying. HRCRatliners are the 5th columners, they've committed treason}} * Famous Spymaster Graham Fuller set up Gulen in this spy ratline network. At the end of the cold war and the CIA brought down the Russian government, Fuller said, 'we might as well use these guys all over the world'. Fuller used them for counterintelligence insurgencies in many countries to undermine the pillars of every society, so that when the revolution *does* happen it's a rapid collapse like a building collapsing. {{9/11}} * Amjad Awan BCCI -- Iran Contra recap * The Congressional folks are just pulling the house down on themselves. These house dems going on camera to accuse Trump of this false russian narrative is just going to cause them to self destruct. * Schumer recap and his relationship to Attar, Awan, McCaskill * Awan Financials recap * ""An Orgy of Evidence"" --- Dem Congressional staffers are going to be available to be called as witnesses * I saw that when the gang of 8 intelligence group came out yesterday, all the D staffers were running from the cameras because they didn't want to be recognized because they can be called and subpoena'ed. * The problem with the Russia hoax is there is no evidence because it didn't happen. * {{ Dems are running a whisper campaign }} * Andrew McCabe should not be in charge of any of these investigations. He doesn't even have the FBI involved in the Awan investigation he has the Capitol police looking at it, for an international spy ring. {{Pathetic}} --- * [[**Day 138 Part 2**](URL * Preet Bhara has been asked to resign. Maybe the new DA will actually look into the HRC * Dedicate to @NYPDDetectives are the folks that did the work.

Buzzfeed did a big hit piece on them * Truepundit hit back with a rejoinder 'buzzfeed took four years 20-30M to get to the same numbers truepundit got to organically' * Because if you do good journalism, people beat a path to your door. * HRC needs to answer for the ties to the MB but also giving the Awans/Gulen Movement the most deadly cyberweapons that could literally take down our country--this is the deep state. * Here are the Awans's webpage--contains the caption, *""We are Awans we Break Bones Not Hearts""* * {{ George fails to point out this is on the ""Stay Calm"" meme with the Crown at the top -- I think this is significant because I've long thought that the ""Stay Calm"" meme is State Propaganda--put out by the CIA/NSA, same with Pepe/Kek the frog; any meme that gets sold on merch in Target is likely an operation, imho }} * The ""Awans"" are a loose association of terrorists and policing/politics, PSP--SSP, in the same description of the father Mohammed Shah. * How Awan has a father Shah proves my point {{If you are correct about Imran being the same as the one in Pakistan}}, that Awans are a spy cover name much like ""Bravermans"" are for Jewish spies * Awans imprisoned their stepmother and hacked her phone. They are obviously ISI. When their cover was blown, they grabbed their technology and fled to Pakistan. If you are not guilty [for the 20 burglaries], why would you flee? * Not only did they get information for the 12 yrs from the three most sensitive Intelligence Committees in the House, they kept their own server. This is the same Huma/Hillary story of having their own private server. * Instead of having the Barney Fife Capitol Police investigating this INTERNATIONAL SPY RING, have the FBI investigate this. * Let's get the cameras of the data center, the phone records of these guys, the GPS movement data. This is law-enforcement 101. * Trump tower recap -- Carl Bilt you are going to find is going to be the one who orchestrated this. I could say the university where he did it but I'm not going to say that now. * Brett Baer? Reported this story. It's going to mainstream--that is encouraging. When you forward these stories, they are picked up by the main [[[news. * Graham Fuller designed the program for the Mujahadeen to bring down the SU, and it worked great. But then he turned around and said we should use the Mujahadeen to go after the edge countries of the SU the Five 'Stans' and the One 'Jan' surrounding Soviet Union; but then he made the fatal decision to use the Gulen plan to infiltrate North America--that's where things went south. {{ They didn't expect a bunch of free-thinking refusenikkers to refuse to go along with CIA's nonsense BS after dealing with it for decades }} * CIA teachers that they used to use in Central Asia--operatives that had diplomatic passports--your first clue that they are agents. * Beginning about 2006 they start flooding into the US: TExas and other states in the Midwest. Texas Bryce University, Univerity of Houston was their first entry. These are the orchestrator of Ratlines. These are the IT supply chain. Ratlines of kids, sex trafficking, drug trafficking, of organ harvesting. This is the Gulen movement * Mike Flynn told Erdrogan that Gulen was going to do a coup in Turkey. That's why he was paid the half million dollars * Compare this half million to the 675k dollars that Andrew McCabe was paid to sit on the Huma Server investigation, to sit on the Awan server investigation and HRC server investigation. {{ Well, no that's not why McCabe got it, but it's certainly why he's not recused himself. It's protection money to ensure he'll keep playing for team HRC the Fifth Column }} * Long history of Amjad Awan, BCCI, funnelling drugs through Pakistan through Turkey thru Europe and then through Mexico and the South/Central America funnelling it through NAFTA into the US. * Amjad Awan was convicted for all this Iran Contra activity, with Marc Rich, Bert Lance, Medellin Cartel, Pablo Escobar, Noreiga, MOssak Fonseca. * He was the architect of Iran-Contra, along with Ollie North, George H W Bush, and Graham Fuller. * Dems are pursuing the [Russian narrative] and hitting a brick wall: I do not know why Jackie Speier and Debbie Wasserman Schultz want to investigate Trump on this Russian Hoax, because it's going to bring this Awan thing to a head. * Awan's criminal connections to Hezbollah--double agents. There are going to be connections to the Russian Ambassador for the Iran nuclear deal negotiatons and the Uranium deal in Russia * We still don't have pictures for Ibid or Jamal. In any investigation you want to publish these pictures publicly so the public can help catch them. {{ But if you DON'T want to catch them then you DON'T publish the pictures }} * They are all in Pakistan now so maybe it's a moot point * Omar Awan is involved and he's married to Nataliia Sova--paid 4x the median--and no one is talking about Omar * The best thing McCabe can do is recuse himself, the next best thing is to publish the 650k metadata * Please forward NYPD Detectives * True Pundit is a great news outlet on the scene --- * [[**Day 139 Part 1**](URL * @SaraCarterDC She's with a news outlet called Circa * Feta Gulen has accumulated 40B in Malaysia * There are cases against Gulen in Preet Bharara's Southern District in NY * There are also cases in Erdrogan * Erdrogan has a drug runner Reza Zarrab is a bag man for Pakistan to Turkey Drugrunning * Zarrab was arrested last April and has a pending case with Preet Bharara, * So the surprise firing of Preet Bharara [will cause GulenGang -- HRCRatline to attempt to spirit Zarrab back to Turkey] because if he talks, he will expose the whole drug trade and the 40B dollars in Malaysia. * Preet Bhahara has a signature of taking out low-level ""pizza delivery guys"" of the drug biz. He never goes after the Gulens or Clinton's gang. * {{ Never mistake incompetence for Malice, George. After all, these guys work for the same Gov that brought you Obamacare's website rollout, the DMV, and who misplaced billions of dollars of cybertools--they are a joke, and now everyone knows it. But they are also decidedly dishonest. It's hard to know if they are incompetent, dishonest or maybe even both. }} * NYPD Chief Robert Boyce says there are remarkable crimes in the 650k emails, and yet Preet Bharara looked the other way (at his time magazine story) instead of going after the Hillary crimes. * HRC connection to Amjad Awan via Mena Airport during Iran-Contra * Hillary's server is perhaps a staging server to sell information to other countries * But it looks like Huma Abedin's server is the treasure trove --- * [[**Day 139 Part 2**](URL * In any kind of war situation you need not only people on the ground, as in the Muslim Brotherhood in Libya and Syria; but you also need people running the Network Operations Center--sometimes they call it command and control or eye of god. Or if you're trying to tip-off the Muslim Brotherhood in countries where we're trying to destroy ISIS, you also need information technology folks like the Awan bros to feed information to the guys on the ground so they 'just miss them'. Like Osama Bin Laden--we always 'just missed him'. * HRC recap, Hacking recap -- 'management of the battlefield from an operations / IT perspective'. * Now that Preet has been fired, hopefully a new NY DA and will look at the files. * I imagine the ""shredders"" are going crazy now on the Trump file, the FISA file for the Trump tower and all the other cases Bharara was working on regarding Gulen's gang. * The key thing Trump has to do now that Preet is gone is to go after Gulen, because he had cases in front of Bharara that were being slow-footed at SDNY, as well as Reza Zarrab Turkey Drug deliver boy--who knows the Ratline. Zarrab can lead to the Kingpin if you get him to talk. * Dyncorp does have a contract for teaching the Pakistani Police PSP * SSP do the ratline in Pakistan * The policing is going to be based out of Lahore, Pakistan; the ratline is going to be by the 'Stan' border * Defense Information Systems Agency DISA -- runs the global information grid GIG and who is the biggest user of GIG * Hillary Clinton was the biggest consumer of this system when she was Sec of State.

And that's how they can coordinate with local and state law enforcement as well as other federal agencies in these fusion centers to track you 7x24 * They can do it via triangulation of the cell radio stations, satellite, GPS. * The AWAN server is also going to also have foreign affairs information on oil and deals [economic espionage data] * ""Awans Own Car Dealership that Launders Money"" * Fall Church, VA where Awans had their false front car dealership is also the center for DISA, for the GIG. * The Dept of Homeland Security where they treat the US like a battlefield {{ against US Citizens }} is going to be in Columbus, Ohio * Sessions has a chance to put in a DC DA to take on this issue with the 20 House Burglaries * ***All Sessions has to do is Subpoena the Palantir records.

It had information on every person in the US.*** * McCabe needs to be recused from this investigation and then field-office FBI (4 different offices with Miami office out of the picture) need to have a special taskforce; the original offices that were investigating HRC originally --- * [[**Day 141 Part 1**](URL * @RepLouieGohmert -- only Rep in the house that has talked about the Awan brothers * We want to look into their access to top secret information being foreign nationals, 4 brothers actually and 2 wives * We want to look into the role that Omar played in getting VISAs at the White House * We want to look at their past activities in terms of wiretaps and intercepting cell calls and hacking activities * Rep Gohmert was talking about their unusual overcompensation, which is a red flag indicating that these were sham postings. * Awan Car Dealership Front company recap; they worked at this dealership at the same time they were working fulltime as IT House Staff. * Debbie Wasserman Schultz (DWS) was managing these Awans personally, Speier asked to get them top secret clearance * What I'm asking for is a letter today on Congressional Letterhead from Rep Gohmert asking the question: *""Did the Awans have Top Secret Access?""* * I'd also like to follow up on the fact that the [Awans seemed to have the password to DWS' ipad](URL * The Awans seemed to have a separate server (according to the news) * ***My [next] question is: ""There are several news reports about staffers being fired in a criminal investigation by the Capitol Police, Did the AWANS have root-level access to the 3 most sensitive Intelligence Committees in the House of Representatives?""*** * Andre Carson received funding from the Muslim Brotherhood and yet he sits on the Emergent THreats subcommittee of the House Foreign Intelligence Committee which is a serious conflict of interest that deserves to be investigated as the highest priority. * We want the Awan server to be included in the investigation of HRC and Abedin * We want McCabe to recuse himself because of obvious quid-pro-quo and obstructing these investigations --- * [[**Day 141 Part 2**](URL * Made a mistake, it's @repLouieGohmert * Mental Exercise: What if the Awan brothers were Russian? * Or for that matter we don't know --- they might be working for the Russians!! * Suppose we had 3 different Awans and here's the proof they worked for 31 different Democratic reps, suppose were Republican reps * Suppose they were making 2.5x what the median income was for the other reps * Suppose their wives were making 3-4x what the media income was * Suppose they had a Car Dealership with known ties to Hezbollah, no.
