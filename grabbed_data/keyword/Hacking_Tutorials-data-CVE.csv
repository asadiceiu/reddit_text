Today we are using a CVE that was a big problem in 2017 - EternalBlue. First we are checking with some scripts from nmap then we are confirming it with a metasploit module and we are using metasploit to own the box. We learned how to migrate processes and so much more.

2,CVE,Hacking_Tutorials,Follow up on my hacking Q&amp;A from last week,1,hnr0vf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/hnr0vf/follow_up_on_my_hacking_qa_from_last_week/,2020-07-09 08:26:08,"Hi everyone, I posted about a week ago asking for questions from those just getting started in the field. I had to record this three times because of some technical issues but its finally up. Heres the link and I just want to say thanks to the members in this community for providing some great questions. I got 60 questions in total and couldnt get to them all but I tried my best to make a good video on it. Heres the link: URL If you want to see what questions I answered heres the full list as well: - First Round: The Getting Started Questions - Anonymous What technologies / tools do you recommend? What level of in-depth networking knowledge is necessary? Reddit user /u/lonezombywolf I'm an older guy 28 and have always wanted to get into hacking but have never been super technically fluent with computers. I've recently been learning a lot more especially after ditching Windows for Linux. Two questions I have are how strong of a networking background do you need for hacking? And is this something I'll be able to grasp or will it be over my head? I have recently been learning a little about networking and just how much I didn't know lol. Thanks again for taking the time to share what you know Instagram User @suneel_abireddi Best resources for basics areas needs to covered before starting hacking? /u/UR_legit What are some jobs in the security industry other than penetration testing? /u/deepus For me as much information you can give regarding the actual jobs would be great. Like what's the average day of a pen tester, what's the average day of a blue or red team member. Info that could help us choose what path we would want to do down and how to get there /u/EducationalPair How do you move from general IT Support into a security role? /u/gullywasteman (if you're uk based) what sort of ways are there of getting into the industry? So far my biggest lead is CREST Instagram user @ xlbertgm17 Certs? Where and when to start training? Books? Depends on where you are and if your office will fund Beginning? Comptia Sec+ and Net+ are great Ive heard about their more security focused one and I think they even have a pentest plus now but I cant speak for them Instagram user @edo_tensei_2.0 Can I depend on those udemy courses for hacking and do you have any course suggestions? Sometimes. I feel like theres better material on youtube though Also asks, Can I learn for OSCP for free? I dont need to take the exam, I just want to learn You can learn everything covered on it for free from open source knowledge. But not the course itself Hacking and Cyber Specific ThrowAway How can I reduce reliance on metasploit? Use searchsploit and exploit-db to find the original exploit scripts, read through them and pay attention to the comments and processes then use though How can I start to recognize vulnerabilities aside from ones listed in CVE and elsewhere? In other words, how can I recognize vulnerabilities in software without help from outside databases? How can I learn to translate CVE vulnerabilities into actual exploits? I'll see CVE entries reference things like buffer overflows to mod_ssl and have no idea how to translate that into an actual exploit. /u/wardyward42 One I've always kind of had is do you have a recommended path for certain types of hacking (eg. Penetrating, security analyst, hobbiest, bug hunting, etc) /u/hugo-guenebaut What is SQL injection and is it something i can learn as Im just starting or should i wait until i know more Different video /u/-_-qarma-_- The benefits of using something like Ubuntu over kali to only get the tools you need(building your own hacking machine) I think it's useful since as a beginner you learn a lot doing this, and you download tools as you need them. Meaning you know how to use everything Install the tools as you go and its a struggle /u/gullywasteman I've installed kali linux on a usb. I haven't yet had a look around on it, but have been wondering if it's too advanced for a beginner? Never too advanced, itll be a struggle but youll learn What coding languages are essential? I've set out to learn a new one over summer. Python is a pretty solid one to start with in my opinion. You dont need to be an expert in coding but you should understand coding principles and structures /u/swagalicious786 Quick question, how do decide what your next step is while cracking these boxes? Is it just plain as day? Im more of a beginner so Im tryna get some insight. Misc /u/Deoxal More seriously how do you schedule your time to learn to hack? Before I had a full time job I wasted most of my time playing videogames, I wanted to mod them but I couldn't bring myself to put in the work. I also felt pretty bad about not having a job which contributed to my lack of motivation to pursue hobbies. Now I do have a job but it is quite exhausting so the time I do have at home often goes into playing Brawlstars, a game I want to mod. My two brothers had very strong ADD, they weren't good at school but could really focus on their hobbies which they turned into careers. I on the otherhand was pretty good learning from books in school but can't focus on useful hobbies now."

At first the MSF console command line and the number of available commands might seem a lot and hard to understand and use, but dont be intimidated by them. Once you get to understand the concept and the clear structure it will be very easy. If we put it all together the Metasploit framework consists of the core and base, a lot of exploits, payloads, modules (Ruby classes), plugins, scripts and multiple user interfaces. Metasploit framework also contains some great information gathering tools called auxiliary modules. Auxiliary modules can be used for port scanning, service identification, password sniffing and Windows patch enumeration. Metasploit is highly customizable for advanced users and can be customized the meet your custom needs by writing your own exploits, modules, plugins and scripts. If Metasploit doesnt provide the information gathering module you need by default, than you can simply write it yourself. The msfconsole is the user interface known to be the most stable interface and the one we will be working with throughout the Metasploit tutorials on Hacking Tutorials. Apart from the stability, another benefit of the msfconsole is the option to execute external commands like the ping command and the tab auto completion. There is also a graphical user interface available for Metasploit called Armitage. We will be looking at Armitage and how to use it instead of msfconsole in a later tutorial. Lets continue this Metasploit commands tutorial with updating the Metasploit Framework if necessary and then switch to the msfconsole to see what commands are available to us. Basic Msfconsole commands Assuming you are on Kali Linux 2016 rolling edition we can start the Metasploit framework and msfconsole by clicking the Metasploit icon in the dock. This will start the PostgreSQL service and Metasploit service automatically. Updating Metasploit with msfupdate Lets start with updating Metasploit by using the following command in a terminal session (not in msfconsole): **msfupdate** This command should update the Metasploit framework to the latest version. The updates says that we should be expecting updates weekly(ish). **Beware:** Running msfupdate might break your Metasploit installation. After running this command for this tutorial we ran into errors like: An error occurred while installing pg (0.18.3), and Bundler cannot continue. Make sure that gem install pg -v '0.18.3' succeeds before bundling. This error had something to do with PostgreSQL and to fix this problem first try to run the following commands: **apt-get update** **apt-get upgrade** **apt-get dist-upgrade** This solved to problem on our side, it probably had something to do with an outdated version of a package.

The exploit name will be mentioned in red on the command line as following:  In this example we have changed the context of the command line to the exploit called realvnc\_client. From here on we can retrieve information about this exploit, set the required exploit parameters and run it against a target. If we want to leave the exploit context and switch back to the msfconsole we need to use the back command. The back command will take us back to the msfconsole in the general context. From here on we can issue the use command again to switch to another Metasploit module. The exit command will close the msfconsole and will take you back to the Kali Linux terminal.

The easiest way of using the search function is by issuing the command search followed by a search term, for example flash to search for exploits related to Flash player. By using the search command Metasploit will search for the given search term in the module names and description as following:  As expected there are a lot of exploits related to the often vulnerable Flash player software. The list also includes [CVE-2015-5122 Adobe Flash opaqueBackground Use After Free zero-day](URL which was discovered in the Hacking Team data breach last year. Searching with exploits with keywords You can also use the search command with a keyword to search for a specific author, an OSVDB ID or a platform. The help search command displays the available keywords in the msfconsole as following: The usage of the search command with a keyword is pretty straight forward and displayed at the bottom of the help text. The following command is used to search for modules with a CVE ID from 2016: **msf &gt; search cve:2016** This returns us all exploits with a CVE ID from 2016 including and auxiliary module scanner for the very recent Fortinet firewall SSH Metasploit commands for exploits In the previous chapter weve learned the Metasploit commands to activate an exploit on the msfconsole and change the command line context to the exploit with the use command. Now we will be looking at how to show the exploit parameters and how to change them with the set command. We will also be looking at how to show the payloads, targets, advanced and evasion options. The help show command will display the available parameters for the show command: Show options The show options command will show you the available parameters for an exploit if used when the command line is in exploit context. Lets use the adobe\_flash\_shader\_drawing\_fill exploit and have a look at the options with the following command: **msf &gt; Use exploit/multi/browser/ adobe\_flash\_shader\_drawing\_fill** Followed by the show options command: **msf &gt; show options** The Flash exploit contains a total of 6 options from which only 2 are required: * Retries * SRVHOST (Required) * SRVPORT (Required) * SSL * SSLCert * URLPath Note that the show options command is returning the current selected target below the module options. The default target is 0 which is Windows for the selected exploit. Use the set command followed by the option name and the new value to change the default values: **Set SRVHOST 192.168.0.100** to change the SRVHOST value to 192.168.0.100 **Set SRVPORT 80** to change the port from 8080 to 80 By using the show options command again you can verify that the SRVHOST and SRVPORT values have been changed. You can change Boolean values by using the set command with option name and true or false. Show payloads When we use the show payloads command the msfconsole will return a list of compatible payloads for this exploit. In our flash player exploit example it will return quite a few compatible payloads: To use a certain payload you need to use the set command followed by the payload name: **Set payload linux/x86/exec** Show targets The show targets command will return a list of operating systems which are vulnerable to the selected exploit. When we run the command we get the following output for the adobe\_flash\_shader\_drawing\_fill exploit:  *An overview of available targets for the selected exploit.* This exploit targets both Windows and Linux operating systems. Note that we can use the info command to get additional info about this exploit and targets. To set a target we can use the command set followed by the target ID: **set target 1** By setting the target the list of payloads will be reduced a lot because only payloads will be shown which are compatible with the target:  Show advanced By using the show advanced command we can have a look at the advanced options for the exploit.  Use the set command followed by the advanced parameter and the new value to change the advanced settings: **Set displayablepayloadhandler true**  Show encoders The show encoders command will return the compatible encoders. Encoders are used to evade simple IDS/IPS signatures that are looking for certain bytes of your payload. We will be looking at encoders in detail in a later chapter of the Metasploit tutorials.  To use an encoder use the set command followed by the name of the encoder. Show nops The show nops command will return a list of NOP generators. A NOP is short for No Operation and is used to change the pattern of a NOP sled in order to bypass simple IDS/IPS signatures of common NOP sleds. The NOP generators start with the CPU architecture in the name. We will be looking at NOPS in a later chapter of this tutorial.  To use a NOP generator use the set command followed by the name of the NOP generator. When the exploit is launched the NOP sleds will be taken from the NOP generator. Show evasion The show evasion command returns a list of available evasion techniques.  To change evasions settings use the set command followed by the evasion parameter and the new value.  Metasploit commands for exploit execution When all the required options have been set for the exploit, including a payload and advanced settings like a NOP generator, evasion options and encoding, the exploit is ready to be executed. The exploit can be executed using two commands: run and exploit. Just type run or exploit in the msfconsole and the exploit will run. This will conclude the Metasploit commands tutorial for now. If you have questions regarding any of the mentioned or non mentioned commands, please ask them using the comment functionality below this post.

Professionally, however, I work in Threat and Vulnerability Management. I'm currently in the very early stages on taking my passion of cyber security, mainly vulnerability analysis and ethical hacking, and creating a channel where I can express that.

7,CVE,Hacking_Tutorials,WhatsApp Bug Could Have Allowed Attackers to Remotely Access Files on Your Desktop,1,ezozoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/ezozoc/whatsapp_bug_could_have_allowed_attackers_to/,2020-02-06 18:45:18,"&amp;#x200B; [WhatsApp Bug](URL **HIGHLIGHTS** * WhatsApp desktop application vulnerability is classed as high * It impacted WhatsApp Web client to some extent as well. * WhatsApp users are recommended to install the latest desktop version. WhatsApp has been discovered to have a critical vulnerability that could have allowed attackers to remotely access files from a Windows or Mac computer. The vulnerability, which has been fixed by Facebook, could be exploited using the WhatsApp desktop application. It was a mix of multiple high-severity flaws that existed within the WhatsApp desktop application. Some of those flaws were also a part of the WhatsApp Web client that works on Web browsers. The vulnerability essentially allowed for [cross-site scripting (XSS)](URL that could be used by remote attackers. PerimeterX researcher Gal Weizman discovered the WhatsApp vulnerability that has been tracked as CVE-2019-18426. The researcher stated that the security loophole existed within the Content Security Policy (CSP) of WhatsApp that allowed for XSS attacks on the desktop app. The flaw in the CSP also impacted the WhatsApp Web client to some extent as it provided space to alter rich preview banners with malicious content. The researcher in a blog post mentioned that the Web client was vulnerable to an open redirect flaw that could have led to persistent cross-site scripting attacks triggered by sending specially crafted messages to WhatsApp users. However, the scope of the loophole is found to be quite wider on the WhatsApp desktop application over what was discovered on its Web client. The researcher found that he was able to read the file system and identify the remote code execution (RCE) potential on the desktop application. The only thing that the affected WhatsApp users had to do was to click on the specially crafted message to provide backdoor access to attackers. read more [WhatsApp Bug](URL"
