System information shows the thing is running 4.2.2. Given the multitude of CVEs against old Android versions, especially remote code execution, this seems an odd choice, especially given already known remote drive-by-wire exploits demonstrated on other vehicles. Also I want Android 8's LDAC support, but that's less concerning than somebody bluejacking my car."
