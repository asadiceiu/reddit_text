Following cleanup there were 5 active processes running under nobody and one of them would automatically restart. To be safe I reverted to a backup from prior to the exploit being released. Patched and returned to service and all is well. If the bind logs indicate that a file was deleted you can find the deleted file in the /var/tmp/netscaler/portal/templates directory (or other relevant tmp folders). The XML files are your best bet at trying to figure out what was attempted. Thankfully the 9 attempts on the one I just fixed looked like they were basically trying to sort out what they could and couldn't do.
