I'm Derek from the Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, and we have completed an audit of OpenVPN 2.4.0 with QuarksLab. You can view the synopsis of the results here, and the full report is also linked within: URL The audit resulted in two CVEs URL URL As well as a number of minor issues and fixes. I will be checking this post and answering any questions you might have about the organization, our goals, or this audit for the rest of the day today. After that I will still periodically check this post for updated questions or comments. Thank you to the 33 companies and hundreds of people that supported this effort. This happened because the community made it happen. Our next target is OpenSSL 1.1.1 which is the first version to implement TLS 1.3. The update contains a lot of code changes that give us an opportunity to review and improve the code to make it safer. The biggest way that you can contribute to us is by word of mouth. The more people hear about the positive work that we do, the more likely we are going to get donations, business contacts, and the logistical support that we need to operate and grow. We have many ways to contribute to our cause, some of them being completely cost-free. Check out our donations page to see how to help! "
