2,CVE,kubernetes,Tools to scan running images for vulnerabilities,1,fe4j9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/fe4j9d/tools_to_scan_running_images_for_vulnerabilities/,2020-03-06 10:50:14,"So I have implemented [Trivy](URL in my CICD pipeline which will scan my code &amp; their dependencies for CVEs at build time, but if a new vulnerability gets found I have no way of knowing if it exists in my current running software. I haven't been able to find any tools that are able to scan all images running on your k8s cluster for CVEs, I'm wondering if anyone has a tool or process for this? Currently I think my plan is just to setup an alert to make sure no pods are older than 90 days and if I get notified just kick off another build which should scan the image with an updated CVE list, but this feels like a pretty crappy solution."

We're currently using kubernetes with an ingress that goes through a Intrusion Prevention/Detection System (IPS/IDS) firewall that's managed by another team. That team has largely ignored the IDS/IPS system and turned off almost most of the rules in it as no one was willing to mange it and it was creating production issues by blocking traffic for systems with no clear CVE or vulnerability. As we're moving into istio and changing our ingress the opportunity to revisit how we handle IDS/IPS came up and I thought I'd ping the world here and see if anyone had strong opinions on IDS/IPS vendors or strategies as I know nothing about them."

I see that it's super easy to deploy Kubernetes, but a lot of pre-baked solutions utilise Docker images on the internet (Dockerhub, GCR, etc.) Noting as well that these images are sometimes riddled with CVE vulnerabilities. My question is: How do you all deploy your images which are originating on the internet? - A local repository cache? Ex: Download the required image to a local cache, and potentially rebuilding the images by patching a known vulnerabilities, and then pointing your Kubeneretes manifests at your locally patched versions. - Using a trust system, such as Docker Trust. - Or just deploying from the internet? My questions are based both on ""knowing what's running in Production"", and ""my Kubernetes nodes aren't allowed to pull from the internet directly."" Thanks again, all!"
