URL To quote: ""Are there are any vulnerabilities in Bitcoin which have been fixed but not yet publicly disclosed? Is the following list of Bitcoin CVEs up-to-date? URL There have been no new CVEs posted for almost three years, except for CVE-2015-3641, but there appears to be no information publicly available for that issue: URL It would be of great benefit to end users if the community of clients and altcoins derived from Bitcoin Core could be patched for any known vulnerabilities. Does anyone keep track of security related bugs and patches, where the defect severity is similar to those found on the CVE list above? If yes, can that list be shared with other developers?""

If some fixes have been committed with discreet log messages, it will be difficult for third parties to identify and assess the importance of any critical patches. Do any important ones come to mind? Finally, curious to know, what has changed since 2014 that has resulted in the defect rate, at least based on the list of publicly reported CVEs, to fall to zero? A change to the development process? Introduction of a bug bounty? Best Regards, Simon ------------ original: [URL"
