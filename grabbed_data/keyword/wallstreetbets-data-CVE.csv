In these dire times in which the market gets weirder everyday, commodities seem to be a place to find solace. Gold has been doing good lately and considering the last bullish run it had, it could go on for 3 years. I did a bit a research and tumbled upon [GoldSpot Discoveries Corp.](URL (TSXV:SPOT) # What Are They Doing? GoldSpot is a small Canadian company that was created not so long ago on the premise that the use of unutilized geological, geophysical and satellite imagery big data combined with machine learning/artificial intelligence can change the way exploration on a property is done. The goal is to drive down prices of exploration and offer a simpler way to identify where to mine, but also to elevate the accuracy of metals locations in the ground.You get the idea...I won't get into much details, but if you want more information on the company, [go ahead!](URL Oh and by the way, don't be fool by the name, the company is also engaged in other metals too (Silver, Nickel, Copper, etc...). # tl;dr SPOT is trading at $0.03 over its cash per share metric of $0.10 which is ridiculous considering the ways the company can generate income. With its advances in technology, multiple income stream and its promising portfolio of investments, I believe the company is undervalued by a factor of at least 3. My current estimation of share price is at $0.43 although current market value is $0.14. # Why the price has gone down and Escrow Shares If you take a look at SPOT's chart there is a descending trend although it seems somewhat correlated to the fact that the stock took a couple hits...A look up at trading volumes shines a light on 6 different periods. 4 of them are related to the release of escrow shares to the investors under the following schedule: ## Total of common shares: * *33,489,472* ## Release: * 25% on *February 20, 2019*; * 25% on *August 20, 2019*; * 25% on *February 20, 2020*; * 25% on *August 20, 2020* At those times there is usually an important volume of shares being liquidated... The fifth peak in volume is in October 2019 and it can be attributed to investor *Sheldon Inwentash* liquidating a couple millions of shares. Last but not least, last peak that happened about a week ago on August 13th...I am not sure why this happened. Maybe a change in escrow shares release schedule or not, it is yet to be determined. # Royalties From what I understood, GoldSpot is primarily doing consulting, but they still seem to make moves on mining projects that look promising. They have royalties portfolios on these 4 properties: * **New Found Gold Corp** (TSXV:NFG): Net smelter of 0.5%. Consisting of 70,000 hectares in the very prospective project Queensway (19 metres of 92.86 g/t gold, 6 metres of 285.2 g/t gold). * **Pacton Gold** (TSXV:PAC): 0.5% net smelter. The project is in Red Lake area, Ontario which is close to Great Bear Ressources (TSXV:GBR) who are having tremendous success. * **One Bullion** : 0.25% net smelter with their lands in South Africa * **Manitou Gold** (TSXV:MTU): 0.25% net smelter. New Found Gold is by far the most valuable asset in the portfolio. While digging in the news release I found that GoldSpot previously owned [1% royalty in Queensway](URL so they probably sold 0.5% along the way and with [NFG IPO](URL they probably sold it at a good price. It is hard to price the royalty portfolio because there is no working mine or good resource estimation for there junior miners but with the recent [Gold rally](URL they didn't go down in value. # Investments The bulk of this thesis come from SPOT's investments in some key junior miners. The whole portfolio is not available but from what was publicly disclose, it is possible to assume that these undisclosed assets (investments) are related to mining (why invest elsewhere when you are expert in the industry). With the price of gold going up, these anonymous investments probably surfed the wave along with it. But we can still look at what we know for certain: * **New Found Gold (TSXV:NFG)**: GoldSpot invested $750,000 in New Found Gold around the [4th of March 2019](URL Looking at New Found Gold statements, *On June 18 2019, the company completed a private placement of 1,875,000 Shares at a price of $0.40 for gross proceeds of $750,000*. NFG price as of the time of writting this is [$1.83](URL taking SPOT's stake to around 3.4 million. * **NV Gold Corp (TSXV:NVX)**: Their investment more than doubled (now \~1.4 million from 500k), we can read this information from their [CEO's interview](URL Considering only these two investments from their $10M in assets (non-public probably rose as well), their portfolio rose by \~22% since last available financial information. Over the same period, GoldSpot lost \~40% (0.25 to 0.14) taking the capitalization to just under $14M when they have at least $13.35M in assets (adjusting for the gains in NVX and NFG). # Insiders One of the reason why the stock is so low can be attributed to a change in management. Frank Holmes (U.S. Global), Donovan Pollitt (Pollitt Mining) and Ramon Barua (Hochschild Mining) [left the company](URL This would suggest something bad was about to happen for GoldSpot or maybe a divergence of views within the board committee. Since the announcement none of them withdrew ownership in SPOT suggesting it might be more the latter reason. Though, a flow of new deals for GoldSpot indicate they can do it without the three board members [NV Gold](URL [Yamana](URL [AEX Gold](URL [Margaux](URL [Tembo Gold](URL # Discounted Cash Flow ## What is known ## Consulting Income One relation that caught my eye is the one between the Consulting Income and the Operating, G&amp;A expenses, that for the moment, are pretty much on par. Looking at the company's past 9 quarters, the consulting income grew somewhat in a straight line at 15% QoQ and looking at the same metric year over year we saw in 2019 a growth rate of 78% YoY. When looking at the Operating and G&amp;A costs, it grew at around 17% QoQ. The operating costs are slightly greater then the consulting incomes, but it could easily be explained by the *surprise* cost of inclusion on the Canadian exchange of about $2M in Q1 of 2019. This is a one time fee that can be ignored for estimating future cash flows. Since their ideal long term goal is that with the continuous effort put in by the employees, the cost for providing these consulting services will diminish drastically in the future. The assumption goes towards decreasing Operating and G&amp;A expenses and increasing Consulting Incomes. &amp;#x200B; URL ## Investment Gains Based on the limited information online about their private portfolio of assets, the two *known* recent investments made in NFG and NVG, initially valued at $1.25M are now estimated at $3.5M as of FY 2020. &amp;#x200B; URL ## Assumptions ## Growth Rates Using the data gathered from the company's historical information the following table was made to estimate the future growth of the incomes and costs of the company. Based on the the fact that the company leverages technology, that they've been working at this for 2 and a half years, that they have many projects in their pipeline, and promising Q1 2020 results, the same 80% growth rate between 2018-2019 was used for estimating 2020's results. The rate was subsequently cut in half each year. Terminal perpetual growth rate is set to 3%. Operating G&amp;A costs modeled at a more modest rate to support the main thesis. &amp;#x200B; URL ## Projected Income The investment gains were modeled based on the known information for the year 2020 and used that number for the following years. Assuming there is little known about GoldSpot's portfolio, the fact that royalties will pay for a long time, and their many projects, netting $3.5M over the next 3 years is reasonable. The average gold run also last 3 years. After the investment gains was divided by 2. &amp;#x200B; URL ## Results To discount the future cashflow at the present value the following parameters were used. GoldSpot doesn't have much debt and they finance most of the company through equity. Estimating the cost of equity with warrants is tricky and I decided to use a strong 10% to penalize the valuation. Tax rate is given by the government of Canada's website. |Name|Value| |:-|:-| |Discount Rate|10%| |n\_shares|94,724,876| |Price|0.14| |Tax rate|9%| Using the cashflow generated in the last table, we added back the small D&amp;A of 21,555 yearly back in the FCFF. Nothing else was added to the FCFF due to the limited amount of information on the financials reports. The terminal value of the company was calculated and brought back to the present value. The yearly estimated cashflow were also brought back to present value. The company's share count grows by around 7% yearly. 101M shares was used to calculate the final expected share price of $0.43. URL &amp;#x200B; |Name|Value| |:-|:-| |Expected CF per Share|0.3210| |Current Cash per Share|0.1085| |Expected Share Price|0.4295| |Current Share Price|0.14| Sitting with a big pile of cash I was curious to see how it reflected per share. It comes out near $0.11/share which is pretty high considering the fact that the company trades at $0.14. The market is basically valuing this company at $0.03/share translating to not even $3M. A company value is reflected the future cashflow and outcome of the company, and I find it interesting that the company is valued at $3M while they will generate at least $3M this year with their investments. Adding the present value per share of the cashflow and the current cash per share the final estimated share prices comes at around $0.43 which I believe is a much fairer estimated value. # So... The earnings should be out any days now [between 8/27 and 9/2 if we believe yahoo](URL and we'll know the fair value of SPOT's investments."

A security vulnerability was disclosed last week that enables an attacker to remotely access and execute arbitrary code on vulnerable deployments. Several trusted sources confirmed an uptick in compromises over the weekend as a result of Rapid7 ($RPD) releasing exploit code. Given that most companies' response and patch processes are slow due to dependence on change management bureaucracy, I estimate there will be increasingly wider spread compromise in the coming weeks and months. Considering this is a critical risk vulnerability given the high impact and probability of compromise, I would also estimate this will impact F5's reputation and bottom line.

7,CVE,wallstreetbets,[DD] Cenovus Energy ($CVE),8,7wvwdx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7wvwdx/dd_cenovus_energy_cve/,2018-02-12 08:52:50,"*Disclaimer: I hold no position in CVE currently, but have in the past, and I haven't decided if I'll start a new position in the next few days before earnings Cenovus Energy (CVE): &gt; Cenovus Energy is a Canadian Integrated E&amp;P &gt; company with 281kboepd of production (lt/med oil &gt; 11%, oil sands 50%, other heavy 13%, natural gas &gt; 26%) and 230kbpd of refining capacity. Most of &gt; the company's production is from oil sands &gt; projects (all of which are SAGD - Cenovus has no &gt; oil sands mining projects), but it also has sizeable &gt; conventional oil and gas developments. Projects &gt; are developed in phases with repeatable &gt; concepts/designs. As energy/oil stocks have been hit harder than most during the past few weeks, Cenovus has fallen nearly 30% based on no new information other than systemic issues with the sector. As the price of oil has declined the past week and change (~10% drop), $55-60 per barrel of WTI is near the bottom of the economical scale that makes sense for oil sands projects. CVE though has a solvent-aided process (SAP) technology that allows it to be near break even as low as $45 per barrell, far below what other competitors would live at. This technology though is *just* starting to be put into place and will take several months for a full roll out, but should allow CVE to be among the lowest cost oil sand producers out there. In December, CVE released its [2018 guidance](URL citing several cost savings: (2018 budget vs. Nov. 1, 2017 guidance) Per-barrel oil sands operating costs  down 8% Per-barrel Deep Basin operating costs  down 11% Per-barrel oil sands sustaining capital costs  down 12% Christina Lake phase G go-forward capital efficiencies  a 21% improvement (vs. previous estimate) Total oil sands production  up 26% Now a major negative is that CVE has taken significant focus in deleveraging their balance sheet. To do this, they've had to sell off assets. Obviously this will lead to lower net income, but it also means lower debt payments and capex reductions, leading to high equity value. On Friday, a worker died at their Christina Lake facility as a drilling rig was being moved. Though this may have had an impact on the stock, it's hard to attribute as the stock continued its slide in the mass energy selloff. After releasing it's 2018 guidance in December, CVE gained ~30% before giving it all back due to the systemic energy selloff. CVE trades at a FY P/E of 9.6x and a 0.8x FY P/B. It also pays a $0.20 dividend, making a current dividend yield of 2.6%. CVE has beaten earnings expectations for four straights quarters. The consensus price target (per MarketBeat) is $15.10, with PT of: BofA Merrill Lynch: $12.50 CFRA: $13 Morningstar:$16 Using the lowest PT ($12.50) would represent ~65% return from the current price. CVE announces Q4 earnings on Thursday."

I'm assuming that - IF the entire canadian energy sector gets wiped out due to extremely low oil prices, this ETF will go to shit and lose probably half its value. I don't know what the likelihood of this happening is. I think that's a worse case scenario. So this trade will be a 100% loss or gain type of trade. I will commit 5% total portfolio to this trade broken down over 5/6 entries. Reassess situation once 50% of this has been committed. Expected pivot points to where entry will be made. 10.00 9.50 8.50 7.50 6.50 5.50 3.50 1.50 0.50 Depending on where it sits next friday, sell an ITM put nearest the underlying price, with expectation of being put shares.

Four Canadian Oil Picks for Defense Credit Suisse We have lowered cash-flow-per-share estimates for the Canadian oil and gas sector by about 10% for 2015, about 20% for 2016 and about 15% for 2017, based on our updated crude outlook and incorporating potential for further cost reduction. Our lower cash-flow-per-share (CFPS) estimates position us about 5% below consensus for both 2015 and 2016, respectively. With lower sector cash flows, near and longer term, we have reduced targets by about 15%, with the greatest reductions among oilier, more-leveraged names. In this challenging environment we remain defensive in our sector positioning. As such, we continue to favor companies with room to re-lever balance sheets in the near term while growth is preserved for the long term. Preferred names include Suncor Energy (ticker: SU), Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ), Cenovus Energy (CVE) and Arc Resources (AETUF). On a 12-month view, as oil prices are expected to rise into the about $60-per-barrel West Texas Intermediate (WTI) range by second-half 2016, we see about 20% total return upside for the group on average, based on our revised target prices and expected dividends. Credit Suisse has updated its macro commodities view -- new forecasted oil prices remain low through mid next year, which should keep U.S. upstream activity contained (depressed) through 2016. Further out, through 2017, prices are kept below $65-per-barrel WTI, the level from which oil-production growth from Americas best shale basins would again accelerate. Only in the 2018-2019 time frame are oil prices forecast to rise above $65 a barrel for WTI and $70 a barrel for Brent. Natural gas and natural-gas liquids (NGL) price forecasts are unchanged with the latest view. A lack of clarity around Alberta fiscal and regulatory policy under the new New Democratic Party government continues to compound the uncertainty associated with the broader macro environment. While assurance has been provided that current royalty rates will remain in effect until year-end 2016, a review has been initiated with proposals expected by year-end 2015. The Federal election in October could also influence a range of items from corporate taxation to greenhouse gas (GHG) policy, in addition to U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rates. Against a lower-for-longer oil price outlook and uncertain Canadian political backdrop, there are greater risks for Canadian crude supply."
