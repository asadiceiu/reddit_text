My question is, are there any known circumstances where a VPX event/crash,etc. can also completely crash the entire SDX? Yesterday our security group was examining a single VPX, they were in the BSD shell looking for evidence of compromise from the recent CVE. They ran ""gzcat * | grep ""Jan 11"" | more"" and the entire SDX crashed and rebooted. When it came back up, of course all the VPXes were secondary, so they got back on the VPX and this time just running ""top"", crashed the entire SDX again. This shouldn't happen; crash the whole VPX sure, but the whole hypervisor and everything?"

10,CVE-,Citrix,Citrix ADC 11.1 - Final Recap on Crash Issues,1,ewopre,https://www.reddit.com/r/Citrix/comments/ewopre/citrix_adc_111_final_recap_on_crash_issues/,2020-02-01 00:48:45,"Hey guys, Just wanted to finally put a cap on this series of posts. For those of you following along at home this is a summarization/recap of: 1. [Citrix ADC 11.1 - Crashing Causing Statechange](URL 2. [Citrix ADC 11.1 - Upgraded and Now ADC is Cycle Crashing](URL 3. [Citrix ADC 11.1 - Update on 2 Posts](URL **Timeline of Events** * November '18 - September '19 - Our production 11.1 internet facing ADC HA Pair is crashing every 2 hours or so. Sometimes more frequently, sometimes less frequently. I am not managing the ADC platforms at this time, so I don't really care. * September '19 - I am now managing the ADC platforms as we've had some attrition. I get into the UIs and logs and start doing health checks and re-familiarize myself with the systems. I start noticing some configuration issues and it looks like they are routinely core dumping. * September '19 - November '19 - After extensive clean up, the production ADCs are still shitting the bed constantly on a regular basis. I start looking into troubleshooting options. I open some tickets with Citrix. * December '19 - After working with support, I decide to punt and just upgrade all the systems across the board. * December '19 - January '20 - All of my HA pairs successfully upgraded with the exception of 2 ADC pairs. My production system running all of our web presences and the dev/qa system we use to test stuff. After the attempted upgrade, the HA system is broken. When HA is configured the secondary cannot join the primary and the secondary just circle boots. The only way to get the secondary online for any period of time to troubleshoot, is to break the HA configuration on the primary. Citrix works with me and for about 3 weeks it's just a cycle of getting log files and doing investigation. Around the end of December, they make the realization that the crashing of the secondary is due to HA, AppFw, and AppFw Audit logging to Syslog. We disable syslogging across the entire platform and behold, stability returns to the environment, but we are completely blind to any activity on our ADCs. No SSL logs, no appfw logs, no nothing. Without logs, we have no alerting. * January '20 - Citrix delivers a custom build and it resolves the issue. Citrix delivers us 12.1-55.118.nc which is not to be confused with 12.1-55.18.nc with the CVE fix. 55.118.nc was released before 55.18.nc and therefore does not have the CVE built into it. This is ""okay"" because we do not run ADC Gateway on these products, only standard ADC services and AppFw. **Final Thoughts** I am left with a feeling that Citrix is not doing a great job with feature testing. I feel like HA/AppFw/AppFw Audit Logging is not a super bizarre off the beaten path configuration. Maybe most customers running AppFw with AppFw Audit logging are using clustering and not HA which is why it never got reported to Citrix, but a cluster configuration for our organization is definitely overkill. Couple this with CVE-2019-19781 the last few months with me managing the ADCs has left me with a pretty sour taste in my mouth to a product that I never had a super great feeling about to begin with. Furthermore, while my organization is small, we are being folded into our parent company, a much bigger more globally know presence and to really get any forward motion on this, we had to leverage our parent company's relationship with Citrix and I feel like if we hadn't this would still not be fixed to this day. I feel sorry for smaller companies that don't have the leverage that I was afforded in this situation. I do have to say, our sales guys worked really hard to get Citrix management and engineering to push something through for us but again... this should not have even been a problem in my mind. What it ultimately came down to was the packet processing engine was barfing because of how the syslog stuff was being sent. Now again, I was not privy to all the technical details, but that's about all the explanation I got. Currently, I am fortunate that my production application ADCs running AppFw do not have anything to do with our Gateway based ADCs. I am now forced to manage multiple branches of 12.1 and I find it arduous and annoying: * 12.1-55.13.nc is running on the vast majority of our ADCs. Most of our stuff is internal facing, doesn't run the Gateway Service, and has no access to the internet so we do not need to run 12.1-55.18.nc on these. * 12.1-55.18.nc is running on at least one HA pair in all of our data centers. This along with the responder policy had to be applied to prevent CVE-2019-19781. * 12.1-55.118.nc is running on one HA pair in each of our data centers because our primary web facing application goes through it and we run the AppFw product on it as well as Syslogging with an Audit Policy applied to the AppFw. Whatever the next GA is, I was assure that it will unify all the updates that we need for our environment but there's no ETA at the present time. January 20th was supposed to be the release where the HA/AppFw/AppFw Audit Logging fix would be applied however that release got pushed due to the CVE. Again, I feel like this whole cluster fuck has been such a pain in the ass and I really am annoyed that this became an issue over the holidays as applying updates and fixing internal systems ran into a lot of my own personal time. Hope this helps someone."
