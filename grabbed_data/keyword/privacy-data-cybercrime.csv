In-System Programming allows a police detective to connect wires directly to the memory chip of a cellphone to obtain evidence. The connections, done under microscope and with a soldering iron, bypass lock codes that would normally keep an investigator out, police said. Manchester police obtained equipment and training from the U.S. Secret Service, which recently hosted a four-week Mobile Device Examiner training for Cybercrime Unit Detective Lou Krawczyk at the National Computer Forensic Institute in Hoover, Ala. Cellphones are playing an increasing part in the investigation and prosecution of crimes. For example, evidence in the recently concluded trial of Squad gang-leader Brandon Griffin included cellphone videos of house shootings ordered by Griffin and text messages discussing the crime, according to Manchester police Sgt. Kenneth Loui, commander of the departments Cybercrime Unit. In a 2008 murder case, data from cellphone towers used by baseball-bat killer Todd Peters in Manchester pinpointed him at the crime scene as well as the location where the murder weapon was disposed of, Loui said. Cellphones are used today by virtually everyone, and as the primary communication tool, it can oftentimes be the primary source of evidence, said Hillsborough County Attorney Michael Conlon, whose office won 53 convictions against Griffin. He said cases involving drug transactions, thefts, domestic assaults, and sometimes commercial transactions are aided by access to cellphone evidence. He noted that cellphones can also provide evidence favorable to a defendant. Conlon said his office has never seen a case dismissed because it could not get to cellphone evidence. But cases could have been stronger with the data. Its a big unknown when you cant get in before the deadlines surrounding charges and trial, and the increased cybercrime expertise at the investigatory level should be helpful to prosecution in that regard, he said. In most cases, police need an approved warrant to search data stored on a phone. But they can do so with written consent and in cases of exigency, Loui said In a statement to the media on Wednesday, Manchester police said phones can contain evidence such as photos, videos, GPS locations and communication between co-conspirators. The hard part is getting past the cellphones security features to recover the evidence, the police news release said."" URL"

5,cybercrime,privacy,Feeling confused about your Facebook privacy and don't know what heck is going on? I spent way too long putting this thread together. Please share and lets open up a discussion about our online privacy.,19,860j6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/860j6d/feeling_confused_about_your_facebook_privacy_and/,2018-03-21 19:34:02,"#####I am not a writer, I am not a professional, I don't live in the US. I am just a concerned citizen and I want to talk to everyone but what is going on. #####The following eight paragraphs are a summary of the most important events I cover in this post. It is really long, but I encourage you to read these next eight paragraphs at least, so you understand what is happening to your private information right now. After these eight paragraphs I provide a bit more of an expanded view and a lot of source information if you are enjoying the read or if you are sceptical. I encourage you to do your own research and if you have any suggestions or feedback please add to the discussion for us all to share. We need to change the way we view our personal information and privacy and how it affects the world around us. It starts today with simply being aware of what is going on so we can take a proactive approach to reducing the amount of data we share with companies. Facebook is now a surveillance tool and we need to realise when it is being used against us. If you want to check out how to delete your account and skip the rest, you can follow this link: URL Cambridge Analytica is a company that has been illegitimately accessing private information and Facebook has known about this since as early as 2014. Cambridge Analytica has allegedly built up to 50 million 'psychographic profiles' that they use to target us with political advertising and much more. Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge Analytica and recently blew the whistle on CA has said using the tool, they could find out our ""inner demons"". He described the experiment as ""grossly unethical."" Using the collected data Cambridge Analytica also created political strategies for their clients, manipulating political scandals involving their clients' opponents using hired actors, sex workers, spies and subcontractors. They attempt to sway their voter bases, and offer political bribery and tampering as a service to use as blackmail. It is very likely this data and these strategies are shared with other entities such as the Internet Research Agency who were indicted in February by the FBI for their meddling in the 2016 election. You can view Alexander Nix, founder and CEO of Cambridge Analytica, admitting to this in this video: URL Facebook acted as the platform for Cambridge Analytica to both harvest the data, and as one of the many advertising platforms used to sway public opinion and get officials elected. This is not limited to the UK and U.S. at all, as they also mention clients from several other countries in the video. This video is part 2 in a 5 part undercover investigation, of which part 3 is now released revealing Cambridge Analyticas ties to the Trump campaign during the 2016 election. Facebook were complacent and they did not give users appropriate disclosure or control over the setting to prevent their friends from their sharing their personal information on their behalf with third party developers.This gave birth to a tool that has been used to ""manipulate entire countries"", one of the creators claim. It was a simple quiz app that 270,000 people consented to using, sharing those users entire friends lists raw profiles, subsequently leading to the leak of the private data belonging to 50 million people due to hidden permissions in the app. On Facebook and other social media platforms, we have existed inside our own political echo chambers, constantly fed paid tailored news and information, both true and false, that resonate with our beliefs and morals and empower us to stand tall and align with our political sports team, chanting their name from the grand-stands so loud we can't actually hear what's going on. This goes for both the left and the right - we are all guilty of it. We need to come together and see that this is larger than team politics - it is a global security crisis and so many nations are not prepared to begin the next stage of information warfare. We as a society are majorly uninformed about good security practice, so before I leave Facebook myself I will share a bunch of my personal security tips on my page. There are political and very likely non-political interests, both foreign and national, in keeping us divided instead of united to find global solutions to the problems we face as a planet, such as how we deal with a global data crisis. Governments around the world need to hold these companies accountable for interfering in electoral processes, undermining our - say, and using our data without our permission to do so, instead of using these very tools and companies for their own political agendas. As investigations continue, I am sure we will see more light shed on the tools Cambridge Analytica were using, the scope of their work, the 2016 U.S. election, entire countries national security held to ransom and undermined by young app developers, information warfare, big data and dirty politics. Below I will expand on my reasons for my claims and why you should care. If you have read this far, thanks for sticking with me. I dont have much of a political education and I dont understand a lot of the economic powers that motivate these kinds of political agendas, but I do have a pretty solid understanding of technology and security, and how it was used against us by Cambridge Analytica and our good friends, Facebook. ##Connecting the dots. I will start with a fairly vague yet sinister quote from the world's latest techno-super villain: ""These are things that don't necessarily need to be true as long as they're believed."" - Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica Founder As I began writing this article, Alexander Nix was the CEO of Cambridge Analytica. He has since been suspended pending a full investigation after an undercover investigation was revealed on Channel 4 in the U.K. This highlights how rapidly the case is moving and how important it is to stay up to date with the revelations unfolding right now. URL We are living in an informational/psychological warfare era that utilizes our own information against us, and it is a direct result of our own actions. Throughout this post and my future posts, I will touch base on personal privacy, accountability, some things to watch out for online and some tips to protect yourself moving forward. I want you to walk away with the ability to question everything I wrote and find answers for yourself. If you are a Black Mirror fan, this is the real life thing, happening right now before eyes, and we have all been apathetic in allowing it to become our reality. If you have read 1984 and you can resonate with 'Big Brother' then please keep reading to try and get a grasp on how Orwellian our reality is right now, and how we are losing grip of more and more personal freedoms and privacy for the sake of convenience. I will admit now there will be hints of political bias in here but I have nothing against anyone with beliefs that differ from mine. I have a problem with democracy being undermined and the small people having their vote or say taken away, altered or tampered with through a criminal process. Our vote is the only real method we have in expressing our political beliefs, how we believe our world should be structured and who we believe best fit to captain the ship. I have a huge interest in personal security and privacy and think it is important to help others connect the dots so they can understand what is at stake, so they know how their data was used and so they can make an informed decision as to whether to continue sharing it or not. Most importantly, I believe all of us have been complacent in this process, through ignorance, lack of education, apathy and having faith in devious corporations. I have joked about Facebook grossly invading our privacy in the past, but now it's actually happened on a scale I couldnt quite believe until I learned about their involvement in the Cambridge Analytica story that unfolded over the last week. ##Facebook is under criminal investigation. A few hours ago it was announced Mark Zuckerberg has been asked to hop on a plane and travel to London to speak before MPs in regards to an ongoing investigation surrounding Cambridge Analytica illegally harvesting raw data from up to 50 million Facebook profiles. Zuckerberg is accused of previously having given ""misleading"" evidence to Parliament and ""consistently understated the risk"" of user data being used without their consent. Approximately 270,000 users consented to using an app through Facebook's' platform that offered personality predictions for users. They would complete a questionnaire survey that gave the user a personality score. Users were advised in very small print that the information was being collected for academic purposes. When installing the application, it asked for permissions that granted the application access not only to the users personal information, but the personal information of the users entire friends list. Depending on when you set up your account, this data could have been shared since as early as 2007. The ability to control this setting was hidden from users, so they had no control over the data being shared with Cambridge Analytica. It appears Facebook has known about this setting since as early as 2015, as Christopher Wylie of Cambridge Analytica had a letter from Facebooks own lawyers admitting that Cambridge Analytica had acquired the data illegitimately, despite claiming they did not know about the ""breach."" These profiles could potentially include both your profile and mine, our friends, family members and children. Up until quite recently, we literally had no say or control, other than to delete Facebook completely. Even then, can we trust Facebook to delete our profiles completely? On a side note, Facebook recently announced it was going to start censoring fake news. On the surface this looks fantastic but you have to question the timing and how this is going to allow them to make sure this news about Cambridge Analytica doesn't spread too far and kill their stock value. Who decides what is fake news? Facebook have shown us they are simply untrustworthy. Here is the latest Independent article on the matter: URL - UK Parliament summons Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg to be questioned over Cambridge Analytica scandal Here are some more links about the case: URL - Letter from U.S. Senate to Mark Zuckerberg addressing Cambridge Analytica's data collection URL - Revealed: 50 million Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach - The Guardian URL - Cambridge Analytica: Facebook boss summoned over data claims - BBC URL - How Cambridge Analytica harvested Facebook data, triggering new outcry - Sydney Morning Herald URL - Zuckerberg saved tens of millions of dollars by selling Facebook stock ahead of Mondays decline - Marketwatch ##Cambridge Analytica. From their wiki: *Cambridge Analytica (CA) is a privately held company that combines data mining and data analysis with strategic communication for the electoral process. It was created in 2013 as an offshoot of its British parent company SCL Group to participate in American politics. In 2014, CA was involved in 44 U.S. political races. The company is partly owned by the family of Robert Mercer, an American hedge-fund manager who supports many politically conservative causes. The firm maintains offices in London, New York City, and Washington, D.C.* URL Notable campaigns that Cambridge Analytica have worked with as per the wiki are Ted Cruz and Donald Trump in the U.S., as well as Nigel Farage and Brexit in the UK. They are currently facing criminal investigations in both of these countries. They are self-claimed 'political consultants' that offer services such as rebranding and restructuring entire election campaigns, writing party manifestos and conducting surveys, research and analysis. Personally, I see them as the secret rogue surveillance cyberpunk operations unit from futuristic dystopian fantasies, except they exist right now in 2018 and already well and truly underway with the process of entrenching their roots in global politics. If they have all of the data, they know all the secrets, all the candidates dirt and can hold anyone ransom using that information,they already hold all of the power. Especially when they hold power over those who hold power. Cambridge Analytica also state they have ""different entities"" they can subcontract to who are able to bribe political opponents with money, land and ""Ukrainian girls."" If it sounds far-fetched, which it certainly did to me, you can watch the video in the article below: URL Channel 4 in the UK has just released part 3 of their 5 part undercover investigation with Cambridge Analytica. This released when I was well over halfway into writing this article and follows the video above, so I will add it here because it is by far the most important piece of evidence in helping connect all of these dots: URL In this video, Alexander Nix claims to have met Donald Trump and to have provided (in regards to the Trump campaign) ""all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting, we ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign, and our data informed all the strategy."" Other employees in the video discuss other strategies they employed to secure victories in swing states, how to avoid investigations in to their clients, setting up self-destructing emails using ProtonMail, using shell companies including 'charities' to avoid tracing campaign payments to Cambridge Analytica, their involvement in specific ""Defeat Crooked Hillary"" attack-ad campaigns and more. Following the video Cambridge Analytica have suspended Alexander Nix, pending a full investigation. URL URL Facebook has been removing the article below from it's website. This is posted on The Guardian, a very respectable newspaper. It introduces Christopher Wylie, the 27 year old whistleblower data specialist that handed over the raw profile data Cambridge Analytica had collected and has been in hiding until recently. From the article: ""On 27 February, as part of the same parliamentary inquiry, Rebecca Pow, MP for Taunton Deane, asked Cambridge Analyticas CEO, Alexander Nix: Does any of the data come from Facebook? Nix replied: We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data. And through it all, Wylie and I, plus a handful of editors and a small, international group of academics and researchers, have known that  at least in 2014  that certainly wasnt the case, because Wylie has the paper trail. In our first phone call, he told me he had the receipts, invoices, emails, legal letters  records that showed how, between June and August 2014, the profiles of more than 50 million Facebook users had been harvested. Most damning of all, he had a letter from Facebooks own lawyers admitting that Cambridge Analytica had acquired the data illegitimately."" URL If you really want to go down the rabbit hole, you can follow this fantastic comment from /u/Puffin_Fitness. It provides an excellent timeline with sources that details the depth of the relationship between Russia and Facebook: URL ##The Internet Research Agency. To introduce the Internet Research Agency, I must recommend this fantastic article in the NY Times. This article is from 2015 and pre-dates all of the current political madness. I read this prior to Robert Mueller's indictments and was absolutely fascinated. URL The Internet Research Agency are a Russian consulting firm that are geared towards creating fake user profiles and content to create dissent in online conversation and divide citizens in the U.S. They also aim to create political unrest at protests and spread fake news. This mega-link breaks down proven cases of 'astroturfing',the name given to the type of work the Internet Research Agency and other paid Russian bot-farms produce: URL Astroturfing occurs on Reddit itself, on Facebook, Twitter, everywhere. As you can see in the link, their influence is not isolated to political discussion. On February 16, Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russians and 3 Russian entities in relation to interference in the 2016 U.S. Election. They were ""accused of violating U.S criminal laws in order to interfere with U.S. elections and political processes."" The indictment would charge them with ""conspiracy to defraud the United States, three defendants with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, and five defendants with aggravated identity theft."" URL URL I am still trying to figure out Russia's end game, but they are absolutely setting themselves up to make a mockery of the United States' security and approach to combating information warfare. Ultimately this exposes the U.S. and shows Russia to be the real global super power when it comes to fighting on our new digital battlefronts with cutting edge propaganda tools. In just recent news they are accused of already manipulating local midterms in the U.S. and poisoning a former Russian double-agent spy Sergei Skripal in UK, sending a very clear message to the world that they are quite clearly not to be fucked with, even in Britain. URL URL Russian media also claimed that Russia had snuck nuclear attack submarines near U.S. bases undetected. URL ##Trump. This is a fantastic quote from 26/5/17 courtesy of Jared Kushner, husband of Ivanka Trump and advisor to Donald Trump: We found that Facebook and digital targeting were the most effective ways to reach the audiences. After the primary, we started ramping up because we knew that doing a national campaign is different than doing a primary campaign. That was when we formalized the system because we had to ramp up for digital fundraising. We brought in Cambridge Analytica. I called some of my friends from Silicon Valley who were some of the best digital marketers in the world. And I asked them how to scale this stuff. Doing it state by state is not that hard. But scaling is a very, very hard thing. They gave me a lot of their subcontractors and I built in Austin a data hub that would complement the RNC's data hub. We had about 100 people in that office, which nobody knew about, until towards the end. We used that as the nerve center that drove a lot of the deployment of our ground game resources."" URL Here is a fresh article from 20/3/18 posted on Politico now showing the Trump Campaign trying very hard to distance themselves from Cambridge Analytica. This article came before the video release revealing Alexander Nix discussing Cambridge Analytica's involvement in the 2016 election. The writing is quite clearly on the wall. URL Again in case you missed it, shortly following that article we had this video drop from Channel 4 discussing Cambridge Analytica's involvement in the Trump campaign today. URL This link allows you to view Trump campaign expenditures: URL This shows approximately $5.9 million dollars in expenditures paid by the Trump Campaign to Cambridge Analytica in 2016. I will let you make your own judgement based on those links and again encourage you to explore yourself. The conclusion being drawn here is that this using this data, Cambridge Analytica, Facebook, The Internet Research Agency and/or Russian entities and members of the Trump Campaign conspired to meddle with or were complacent in meddling with the 2016 US election. In the process,compromising our personal, national,global and online security and using our own personal information against us without our permission. I could go on for literally hours -there are so many articles coming out as I type this that I can not even keep this article 'up-to-date' as it is. If you want a good place to start, check out /r/the_mueller for almost everything related to the ongoing investigations. ##Why all of this matters so much. One of the most important things we need to think about is that these political campaigns and Cambridge Analytica's partners very likely hold our own personal data, in addition to the governments that end up seizing this data and we dont know what they might plan to do with it. From what I have read, we don't know the full extent of the raw profile data that was shared.We only have Mark Zuckerberg's word that it was a limited amount of personal information. I am sure we will find out throughout the course of the investigation. We need to think about how a candidate that gets elected might choose to use our data against us once in power. For example, you could be held legally accountable for things you said and did years ago, publicly humiliated or lose your employment and home. Another foreign government may have purchased that information and have access to employee records in our places of work, thanks to us all adding our workplace on Facebook. The list goes on. We can no longer trust corporations and our governments to protect our data, let alone appropriately penalise those who fail to do on such a catastrophic level that allows psychographical profiles of over 50 million people to be built based on the consent of 270,000 users. We were treated as mere metrics on paper influenced by well written headlines and political commentators that don't actually exist, characters that are built to our preference using our own stolen data, and political advertising tailored towards us, paid for in foreign currencies. They do not care about us,they only care about the single power that we hold: our right to vote. The last power we hold is the one they think they are smart enough to take without us knowing. Cambridge Analytica reportedly spent just 1 million USD obtaining the data they used in the 2016 US election. The first steps we can take to protecting our privacy are simply acknowledging that this is happening, thinking about what kind of information is safe to share and being aware of when we are at risk. We must learn when to keep our private information safe, who we can rely on to protect it and what steps we ourselves can take to protect it. I encourage you to take two minutes to read the privacy policy when you sign up to anything, use fake names, dont attach your address and phone numbers, dont give shitty third party apps any fucking permissions and write your secrets down on paper. ##Anyone else? Pay attention to the other companies that handle your data. Mobile providers, mobile manufacturers, internet providers, banks, web browsers, web browser extensions, doctors and hospitals, computer part manufacturers, credit card companies, rewards programs, gaming platforms, any cloud services or online file storage services you might use. URL - Given Facebooks Privacy Backlash, Why Arent We Angrier With the Broadband Industry? - Motherboard Don't use free public hotspots. Ever. If you absolutely must, make sure the terms and conditions don't read like these: URL Let us not forget about Ajit Pai, the FCC and the U.S. government stripping it's citizens of protections surrounding their freedom to access information and educate themselves. URL Let us not forget about the Panama Papers, multi-billion dollar tax havens left to rot in shell companies serving as tax loopholes for those who probably just got a nice fat round of tax cuts in the U.S. URL Or the Paradise Papers, more or less the same thing. URL Let us not forget about the Equifax scandal that exposed the personal and financial records of 143 million U.S. consumers, or how they didn't announce the breach for up to 5 months, allowing time for the company's top executives to sell their stocks in the company before receiving a public slap on the wrist. ##Speaking of Equifax. This gives us a fantastic example just how long corporations have been using information warfare tactics in the U.S. From their wiki: *In September 2017, Equifax announced a cyber-security breach, which it claims to have occurred between mid-May and July 2017, where cybercriminals accessed approximately 145.5 million U.S. Equifax consumers' personal data, including their full names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and, in some cases, driver license numbers. Equifax also confirmed at least 209,000 consumers' credit card credentials were taken in the attack. On March 1, 2018, Equifax announced that 2.4 million additional U.S. customers were affected by the breach. The company claims to have discovered evidence of the cybercrime event on July 29, 2017. Residents in the United Kingdom and Canada were also impacted.* That is absolutely massive and the scale of impact will affect people and their credit histories for years to come. What's the point of even playing the game anymore when your credit score is frozen and you cant get another loan for the rest of your life? Not everyone dreams of dying in a rental. Let us not forget - *Equifax was founded in Atlanta, GA, as Retail Credit Company in 1899. The company grew quickly and by 1920 had offices throughout the U.S. and Canada. By the 1960s, Retail Credit Company was one of the nation's largest credit bureaus, holding files on millions of American and Canadian citizens. Even though the company continued to do credit reporting, the majority of their business was making reports to insurance companies when people applied for new insurance policies including life, auto, fire and medical insurance. All of the major insurance companies used RCC to get information on health, habits, morals, use of vehicles and finances. They also investigated insurance claims and made employment reports when people were seeking new jobs. Most of the credit work was then being done by a subsidiary, Retailers Commercial Agency.* *Retail Credit Company's extensive information holdings, and its willingness to sell them to anyone, attracted criticism of the company in the 1960s and 1970s. These included that it collected ""...facts, statistics, inaccuracies and rumors about virtually every phase of a person's life; his marital troubles, jobs, school history, childhood, sex life, and political activities."" The company was also alleged to reward its employees for collecting negative information on consumers.* *As a result, when the company moved to computerize its records, which would lead to much wider availability of the personal information it held, the U.S. Congress held hearings in 1970. These led to the enactment of the Fair Credit Reporting Act in the same year which gave consumers rights regarding information stored about them in corporate databanks. It is alleged that the hearings prompted the Retail Credit Company to change its name to Equifax in 1975 to improve its image.* You read correctly. Since the 1960's Equifax have been conducting information warfare, albeit a little more old fashioned. They rewarded their employees for collecting information they deemed negative about their customers to add to their 'extensive information holdings. Just over 40 years later Equifax have stepped in shit again, this time choosing to pretend it didn't stink while they let 143 million citizens of The United States, The United Kingdom and even Canada's personal credit history get stolen and leaked out by hackers, and subsequently sold and passed around the dark web, to protect stock assets reported to be just over 1 million USD in value, benefiting just a handful of executives at most.

In person and in our homes, we can ask for and expect privacy. We have the ability to control and filter what it is we do and don't share and who we trust. We can shut the door. When we go online, we rely on others, usually faceless entities and a privacy policy we've never read, to protect our information every day. We hand over our email address, password, our license or social security numbers and passport information to companies, with no idea where they store it and no consideration as to why they might even need it or how it might jeopardise our familys security. If and when that data is compromised, we need to trust that we will at least be told in an appropriate amount of time and take precautions to protect ourselves. Let us not forget the governments around the world that forget about us, forget about our voice until election time. Even then all we can expect is empty promises and a campaign structured by another faceless entity, driven only by metrics and financial gain. ###I will get a bit personal from here: These corporations are never punished; instead they facilitate a process for them to make political donations in the form of 'lobbying' so they can 'represent their interests'. The system is pay-to-win, or pay for preferential treatment, and we are already priced out of the end-game completely, but they won't admit to that or patch the game because they have already won. Why would they change the very rules that got them there? I read a comment here on Reddit recently that really struck home with me and has played on my mind for weeks. It read something along the lines of how humans are no longer at the top of the food chain, corporations are. They feed on humans and data, and not even the very top brass of these corporate-mafia hybrid hierarchies are spared on the menu. The political candidates are the puppets and the real masterminds at work are these companies. Now, even our governments and officials bend over backwards to serve the corporation. It eats the planet, it eats the souls inside it and it eats the souls of those in charge. All that matters to the corporation is expansion, profit and gain at the expense of everything it comes in contact with. We can change the trends, we can make the data irrelevant. It's not futile now -there are decentralized alternatives being explored that put the power back in our hands to own our own identity and our own thought space. Until then, we can make the data they own now worthless, by no longer giving them our data free.. Make sure you understand your personal security and if you aren't sure, ask a geek. Most of love us to help. Above all else, be aware. I will be back soon with some more regarding privacy and security tips, our responsibilities moving forward, and anything else that might have happened in regards to these revelations. Please share your own sources, privacy resources, tips, links, have this conversation about with your friends and family and make sure they are aware what's going on."

At the moment I am concentrated towards individuals and will try to cover business later. Maybe someone could link me into a webpage with the latest statistics? My search ended up with data which is either outdated or statistically insignificant. "
7,cybercrime,privacy,How secure is SSL? What information exactly does https secure?,111,4f6d5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/4f6d5o/how_secure_is_ssl_what_information_exactly_does/,2016-04-17 22:14:50,"I'm pretending as if I'm in the know and assuming that https and ssl are the same thing, if they're not, its https that I'm interested in. If you don't know, a few days ago [Pakistan passed an extremely draconian, Orwellian](URL bill which says two things basically: 1.) The gov't is going to be collecting user data en masse 2.) This data can be used to prosecute anyone the gov't wants to, to quiet opposition, silence dissent, whatever. It is a severe infringement on free speech, and the regulation is so broad that essentially everyone is guilty. So to that end, I'm wondering what I can do to protect myself and my family. Unfortunately TOR isn't that user friendly and I can't see people double clikcing on it, and experiencing dial-up like delays as TOR connects. Furthermore the reduced speed isn't doing it any favors. But then I've noticed that in the aftermath of the Snowden revelations, almost every single site I frequent (reddit included) now implements https by default. Is that enough to protect me? What information is someone seeing in that sense (that I am going to reddit, or r/privacy in particular)? I'm not really computer literate so I'd appreciate some layman type guidance to help me navigate these troubling waters. Edit: Thank you all for your explanations and advice :)"
