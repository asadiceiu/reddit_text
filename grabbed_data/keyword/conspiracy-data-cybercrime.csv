The 61-year-old Lebanese-American businessman appeared in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia this afternoon, donning a faded prison jumpsuit and a black mask that covered much of his face. [Nader pleaded guilty](URL in March, less than a year after federal prosecutors charged him over graphic images found on multiple devices belonging to Nader, including videos of toddler-age boys engaging in sex acts with young goats and other farm animals. Prosecutors added the sex-trafficking charge in July, saying Nader had arranged in 2000 to transport a 14-year-old boy from the Czech Republic to his home in Washington, D.C. Holding onto the minors passport, Nader had told the teen and his mother that they would go to prison if they tried to report him. Two decades later, Naders victim is married with a young son and lives in the Czech Republic. His name was not revealed in court Friday as he teleconferenced into Naders sentencing hearing to read a roughly four-minute statement. Its been a long journey, the man said in Czech, his testimony read back to the court through an interpreter. My health is bad. I have ulcers. I stopped eating. I had nightmares. I am still dealing with those now. Saying he hated himself and was ashamed, Naders victim said that, since becoming a father, he is plagued by fear that someone could do to his child what was done to him. Nader agreed to pay the victim $150,000 in restitution. U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema also fined Nader $25,000. Jay Prabhu, an assistant U.S. attorney and chief of his offices Cybercrime Unit, told the court Friday that Nader is a repeat offender but that the minimum sentence of 10 years was enough punishment for Nader, given his past cooperation with prosecutors and his promise to compensate the victim. Nader previously served six months in prison in 1991 after he was convicted of transporting child pornography in the United States. His skin pallid and voice quiet in court Friday, Nader recited a 2-page statement while standing behind a plastic partition that was installed as a safety measure against the novel coronavirus. Im so sorry to all involved and here today, Nader said. There is nothing else I can say. The last year has been the most difficult of my life. Naders only family are miles away. His sister lives in Lebanon, and his brother in California. Because of the pandemic, he has been unable to see them. He emphasized Friday how difficult that has been. Its been very painful for me, he said. Ive listened to whats been said about me, and I can say Im deeply sorry for the pain Ive caused. I am deeply and sincerely sorry for my actions.  I hope you are able to see my true effort to stay on the correct path. Please believe me when I say there will never be a need for me to appear before another court ever again. According to his testimony before a grand jury during former special counsel Robert Muellers probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Nader was tapped by Trumps first presidential campaign team to offer his diplomatic and political insights into the Middle East. Naders professional relationships with power players there, like Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the United Arab Emirates crown prince, was seen as a boon by the Trump transition team. Nader was eventually able to secure a Trump Tower meeting in December 2016 with the crown prince, President Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner and the campaigns chief strategist at the time, Steve Bannon. The meetings focus was to convince Kushner and Bannon that, with Trump elected, America should cool its longtime alliance with Qatar, a longtime enemy of the U.A.E. Trumps then-finance chairman, Elliott Broidy, also promoted an anti-Qatar agenda. Broidy ended up receiving a $2.5 million check from Nader in April 2018 that, according to an investigative report first published by the Associated Press, resulted in the bankrolling of anti-Qatar initiatives in Congress and later, donations to lawmakers like California Republican Ed Royce, who as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs committee at the time, backed the shift in foreign policy. Nader awaits sentencing for separate federal charges in Washington related to his coordination of illegal foreign contributions to President Trumps inaugural fund as well as Hilary Clintons 2016 presidential campaign. Defense attorney Jonathan Jeffress told Judge Brinkema that Naders age and health merit consideration in sentencing. Nader is prediabetic and had a quadruple bypass just months before his arrest. When he was arrested at Dulles International Airport in 2018, he was coming to the U.S. to receive rehabilitative treatment for his heart, Jeffress said. Given that 20 years has elapsed since Nader transported his victim, Jeffress said the potential for Nader repeating the conduct was nonexistent. He also said that the only fundamental disagreement between prosecutors and the defense was that Nader still exhibits a pattern or proclivity for child pornography. These are things Mr. Nader has largely put behind him, Jeffress said. Brinkema was not convinced, noting during the 2018 arrest that there were more than 50 graphic images found on Naders phone  images that prosecutor Prabhu said obviously depicted children sexually or in pain. Prabhu pointed out that Naders criminality stemmed as far back as 1984 when he was investigated for receiving child pornography. That case was ultimately thrown out because the search that uncovered the porn was faulty. I raise these issues not to embarrass Mr. Nader or shock the court. I raise it because it shows he has a persistent issue with this, Prabhu said before also calling the former Trump campaign adviser a persistent and dangerous voyeur for years. Jeffress disagreed, saying that the images shared with Nader by his cohorts in the Middle East were widely regarded as dirty jokes. It meets the definition of obscenity but its not child pornography that someone would use to stimulate themselves, Jeffress said. from [URL"

How it usually happens is the CIA or FBI will recruit an individual who has a cybercrime track record of big hacks and they get flipped into an informant to further agendas. They then go out and target anyone in the hacking community literally anyone interested and they will egg them on to commit fraud and various felonies. The government had an informant try to sweet talk me into doing all this white collar crime because my skills are better applied then not using them, stupid shit like that. Just like hiw the CIA created the war on drugs by bringing the drugs in I have no doubt CIA AND FBI are turning innocent young teens interested in hacking into psychopathic blackhat hackers with no guilty conscience or remorse. They tend to flip and target minors because its hard for them to prosecute them so they either make them an informant or make them into a psychotic blackhat by pushing them over the edge so that when they get caught they become an informant and it becomes this domino effect of blackhat psychos and informants."

Is the Russiagate conspiracy theory a legitimate concern, or is it just partisan hysteria? Now that people like John Bolton are using the rhetoric to their advantage, will its proponents back of a bit? &gt;The evidence against Trump and Russia is huge and mounting every day, declared liberal celebrity activist Rosie ODonnell at a protest in front of the White House last week. We see it, he cant lie about it, she added. He is going down and so will all of his administration. &gt;The charge is treason, ODonnell declared. Protesters held held large letters that spelled it out: T-R-E-A-S-O-N. &gt;ODonnell is by no means alone in her sentiments. Trumps guilt in Russiagate is now assumed by much of the American left, and reaches greater levels of fervor with every passing day. &gt;This kind of partisan religiosity is not new. &gt;In the wake of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, conservative pundit Ann Coulter accused war opponents of treason and insisted of Saddam Hussein, We know he had weapons of mass destruction. &gt;Coulter was confident and she wasnt alone. Virtually the entire mainstream American rightfrom pundits like Coulter and Sean Hannity to President George W. Bush and the Republican Congresswas deeply invested in the notion that Hussein possessed WMDs and that the Iraq war was justified based on that unshakeable premise. This belief was so ingrained for so long that many excitedly rushed to pretend that chemical weapons discovered in Iraq as reported by the New York Times in 2014 were somehow the same thing as the mushroom cloud the Bush administration said Saddam was capable of. &gt;Unfortunately for the right (and America, and the world), that premise turned out to be false. There were no WMDs. Today, only a minority of delusional, face-saving hawks and unreconstructed neoconservatives still parrot that lie. &gt;And far from being traitors, Iraq war opponents today are considered to have been on the right side of history. &gt;Now, Russian collusion could be becoming the new WMDs. &gt;The post-2016 lefts most dominant narrative is arguably their deeply held beliefwith all the ferocity and piety of yesterdays pro-war conservativesthat Russia colluded with Trumps campaign to undermine the presidential election. Many believe that the president and anyone who supports his diplomatic efforts like Senator Rand Paul are in the pocket of Russian President Vladimir Putin. &gt;I will meet not just with our friends, but with our enemies, said Barack Obama in 2008, and he did just that with Putin, as has every other president in recent times. &gt;But Trump-Russia relations have been spun into far-fetched conspiracy theories on the left. New York Magazines Jonathan Chait recently went so far as to speculate that Trump has been a Russian agent since 1987, a cockamamie idea on par with the Weekly Standards Stephen Hayes discredited conspiracy theory that Saddam and Osama bin Laden were in cahoots. &gt;It really was plausible that Iraq had WMDs in 2003 based on what our intelligence agencies knew, or purported to know. Today, it is feasible that American democracy really has Putins fingerprints on it based on things revealed by U.S. intelligence. &gt;But isnt it also possible that the left is reading far too much into Russiagate? &gt;The Nations Aaron Mat believes liberals are overreaching, and thats putting it mildly: &gt;*From the outset, Russiagate proponents have exhibited a blind faith in the unverified claims of US government officials and other sources, most of them unnamed. The reaction to special counsel Robert Muellers recent indictment of 12 Russian military-intelligence officers for hacking of Democratic party servers and voter databases is no exception. Muellers indictment is certainly detailed. Most significantly, it marks the first time anyone has been charged for offenses related to Russiagates underlying crime.* &gt;*But while it is a major step forward in the investigation, we have yet to see the basis for the allegations that Mueller has lodged. As with any criminal case, from a petty offense to a cybercrime charge against a foreign government, a verdict cannot be formed in the absence of this evidence.* &gt;Then the irony kicks in. Mat continues, The record of US intelligence, replete with lies and errors, underscores the need for caution. Mueller was a player in one of this centurys most disastrous follies when, in congressional testimony, he endorsed claims about Iraqi WMDs and warned that Saddam Hussein may supply chemical and biological material to terrorists. &gt;Noting Muellers 2003 WMD testimony is not an attempt to undermine him or his investigation, something Mat also makes clear. But it does serve as an important reminder that intelligence can be flat-out wrong. It reminds us how these scenarios, which so much of Washington and the elite class fully endorse, can be looked back on as lapses of reason years later. &gt;Mass psychology is real. Political classes and parties are not immune. &gt;Suppose, however, that all of the claims about Russian meddling turn out to be true, Mat asks. Hacking e-mails and voter databases is certainly a crime, and seeking to influence another countrys election can never be justified. &gt;He continues, But the procession of elite voices falling over themselves to declare that stealing e-mails and running juvenile social-media ads amount to an attack, even an act of war, are escalating a panic when a sober assessment is what is most needed. &gt;The U.S. could have certainly used less hyperbole and more sobriety in 2002 and 2003. &gt;And theres good chance that when the history books are written about American politics circa 2018, much of Russiagate will be dismissed as more Red Scare than Red Dawn. &gt;With Russia, as with WMDs, left and right have elevated slivers of legitimate security concerns to the level of existential threat based mostly on their own partisanship. That kind of thinking has already proven to be dangerous. &gt;We dont know what evidence of collusion between the Trump camp and Russia might yet come forth, but its easy to see how, even if this narrative eventually falls flat, 15 years from now some liberals will still be clinging to Russiagate not as a matter of fact, but political identity. Russia-obsessed liberals, too, could end up on the wrong side of history. &gt;No one can know the future. Republicans would be wise to prepare for new, potentially damaging information about Trump and Russia that may yet emerge. &gt;Democrats should consider that Russiagate may be just as imaginary as Republicans Iraq fantasy."

When no one offered to pay, Shadow Brokers decided to give it away for free. &gt;In an enterprise setting, however, disabling the Windows Firewall and allowing remote desktop connections is quite common.

There are many more articles beyond these, but what it looks like is the Shadow Brokers or some associated individuals pulled off a series of bank heists prior to releasing the applications to the open market. That also open the [question of what the NSA](URL was doing with the applications? They could have have been tracking ""suspects"" but it seems they could have also been moving money for any reason they chose without records being left in the banking system. The possible exploits were only exposed after a series of bank robberies exposed the power of the tools the NSA had developed. It seems once again crimes have exposed the government's illicit powers concealed by the intelligence community (IC). It is entirely possible that the tools were used legally and only to expose private records of terrorists and spies under FISA warrants, but who knows. The only thing that exposed these exploits was the theft. Kinda makes ya wonder, huh? The evidence and the different styles of hacking listed in the articles about the bank heists suggests that an initial group stole some NSA hacking tools and pulled off the Bangladesh heist. They may or may not have done Ecuador or the Philippines but it seems that at some point the exploits were sold on the open market, but that does not exclude some clandestine deals with other groups that also have employed the exploits. Once the initial 81 million was stolen they distributed the exploits to other groups who may have also attacked the SWIFT system and other targets to make forensics on nation state level zero day attacks that much more difficult. Several groups attempting independent attacks increased the attack vectors making identification even more difficult. It also appears that the hackers may have targeted banks that had the Trojans installed initially. So why would they go for relatively small scores when they essentially owned the SWIFT system. Could the hackers be attacking networks already infected with the Trojan. It really makes sense when you think about the banks they hit. The NSA installs the Trojans to ""observe"" suspected transactions. The hackers obtain the exploits, found the Trojans phoning home and used them to own the infected systems, modified the attack vectors to transfer money. Why not skip the phishing attack when there was already infected banks. Take the path of least resistance that leads back to someone the American government would never admit lead away from the hackers. Of course that means anyone including the IC could have manipulated transactions, but hey that wouldn't have been a robbery would it. Really the tools could have been used to track transactions, but they could have facilitated the IC surreptitious movement of money to fund operations. In all reality it was very clever, make a score, don't get greedy, prevent the creation of a M.O. to narrow investigations and identify the perpetrators. But identifying clever when they managed to steal exploits from the NSA and could use the exploits to attack the banking system. Just the fact that they can't be identified means they are pretty slick and the exploits are not for the novice user. There were some skills at work here. What else was done with the exploits and who are they? [Shadow Brokers Group Releases More Stolen NSA Hacking Tools &amp; Exploits](URL Saturday, April 08, 2017 &gt;Besides dumping some NSA's hacking tools back in August 2016, the Shadow Brokers also released an encrypted cache of files containing more NSA's hacking tools and exploits in an auction, asking for 1 Million Bitcoins (around $568 Million).

Purpose. Transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, including transnational drug cartels, have spread throughout the Nation, threatening the safety of the United States and its citizens. These organizations derive revenue through widespread illegal conduct, including acts of violence and abuse that exhibit a wanton disregard for human life. They, for example, have been known to commit brutal murders, rapes, and other barbaric acts. These groups are drivers of crime, corruption, violence, and misery. In particular, the trafficking by cartels of controlled substances has triggered a resurgence in deadly drug abuse and a corresponding rise in violent crime related to drugs. Likewise, the trafficking and smuggling of human beings by transnational criminal groups risks creating a humanitarian crisis. These crimes, along with many others, are enriching and empowering these organizations to the detriment of the American people. A comprehensive and decisive approach is required to dismantle these organized crime syndicates and restore safety for the American people. Sec. 2. Policy. It shall be the policy of the executive branch to: (a) strengthen enforcement of Federal law in order to thwart transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, including criminal gangs, cartels, racketeering organizations, and other groups engaged in illicit activities that present a threat to public safety and national security and that are related to, for example: (i) the illegal smuggling and trafficking of humans, drugs or other substances, wildlife, and weapons; (ii) corruption, cybercrime, fraud, financial crimes, and intellectual-property theft; or (iii) the illegal concealment or transfer of proceeds derived from such illicit activities. (b) ensure that Federal law enforcement agencies give a high priority and devote sufficient resources to efforts to identify, interdict, disrupt, and dismantle transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, including through the investigation, apprehension, and prosecution of members of such organizations, the extradition of members of such organizations to face justice in the United States and, where appropriate and to the extent permitted by law, the swift removal from the United States of foreign nationals who are members of such organizations; (c) maximize the extent to which all Federal agencies share information and coordinate with Federal law enforcement agencies, as permitted by law, in order to identify, interdict, and dismantle transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations; (d) enhance cooperation with foreign counterparts against transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, including, where appropriate and permitted by law, through sharing of intelligence and law enforcement information and through increased security sector assistance to foreign partners by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security; (e) develop strategies, under the guidance of the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, to maximize coordination among agencies -- such as through the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF), Special Operations Division, the OCDETF Fusion Center, and the International Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center -- to counter the crimes described in subsection (a) of this section, consistent with applicable Federal law; and (f) pursue and support additional efforts to prevent the operational success of transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations within and beyond the United States, to include prosecution of ancillary criminal offenses, such as immigration fraud and visa fraud, and the seizure of the implements of such organizations and forfeiture of the proceeds of their criminal activity. Sec. 3. Implementation.

Available on vimeo [here](URL | 2015 [Terms and Conditions May Apply](URL | A documentary that exposes what corporations and governments learn about people through Internet and cell phone usage, and what can be done about it ... if anything. [Extended Trailer](URL by The Guardian | 2013 [CITIZENFOUR](URL A documentarian and a reporter travel to Hong Kong for the first of many meetings with Edward Snowden. Oscar and Bafta winner for best documentary of 2014 | 2014 [Terminal F/Chasing Edward Snowden ](URL The movie briefly covers NSA analyst-turned whistleblower Edward Snowden and his escape from American authorities to Hong Kong and later to Russia, after leaking classified information about global surveillance programs used by the American government to spy on people around the world and other nations activities. | 2015 [Peter Vlemmix - PANOPTICON](URL Control on our daily lives increases and privacy is disappearing. How is this exactly happening and in which way will it effect all our lives? Stream links [here](URL 2012 | [Killswitch: The Battle to Control the Internet](URL This Internet is under attack. Communications, culture, free speech, innovation, and democracy are all up for grabs. Will the Internet be dominated by a few powerful interests? Or will citizens rise up to protect it? | 2015 [Zero days: Security leaks for sale](URL There is new gold to be found on the internet, and possibly in your own computer. Secret backdoors, that do not have a digital lock yet, are being traded at astronomical amounts. In the cyber world trade, where there are no rules, you are in luck with ""white-hat"" hackers, who guard your online security. But their opponents, the ""black-hat"" hackers, have an interest in an unsecure internet, and sell security leaks to the highest bidder. They are the preferred suppliers of security services and cyber defence. Who are these black and white wizards, who fight for the holy grail of hackers: zero days? | 2015 [Deep Web](URL A feature documentary that explores the rise of a new Internet; decentralized, encrypted, dangerous and beyond the law. | 2015 [Code 2600](URL CODE 2600 documents the Info-Tech Age, told by the events and people who helped build and manipulate it. It explores the impact this new connectivity has on our ability to remain human while maintaining our personal privacy and security. | 2011 [The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz](URL The story of programming prodigy and information activist Aaron Swartz, who took his own life at the age of 26. | 2014 [War for the Web](URL War for the Web demystifies the physical infrastructure of the Internet and uses that as a basis to explore the issues of ownership and competition in the broadband marketplace, privacy, and security. | 2015 [A good American](URL A Good American tells the story of the best code-breaker the USA ever had and how he and a small team within NSA created a surveillance tool that could pick up any electronic signal on earth, filter it for targets and render results in real-time while keeping the privacy as demanded by the US constitution. The tool was perfect - except for one thing: it was way too cheap. Therefor NSA leadership, who had fallen into the hands of industry, dumped it - three weeks prior to 9/11. In a secret test-run of the program against the pre-9/11-NSA database in early 2002 the program immediately found the terrorists. This is the story of former Technical director of NSA, Bill Binney, and a program called ThinThread. | 2015 [Democracy](URL Digitalization has changed society. While data is becoming the ""new oil"", data protection is becoming the new ""pollution control"". This creative documentary opens an astonishing inside view into the lawmaking milieu on EU level. A compelling story of how a group of politicians try to protect todays society against the impact of Big Data and mass surveillance.| 2015 [SILENCED: The War On Whistleblowers](URL | In Academy Award nominee James Spione's latest documentary, three national security whistle-blowers fight to reveal the darkest corners of America's war on terror--including CIA torture and NSA surveillance--and endure harsh consequences when the government retaliates | 2014 [Nothing to Hide](URL Recent debates triggered a radical rethinking of how privacy in the digital age is conventionally discussed. As our social and personal lives are exposed on Google, Facebook and Twitter, the dissolution of privacy shatters social and personal securities. However, as we dare to say, this is not necessarily a bad thing. Is the fight over? And if yes, could we stop worrying and embrace the death of privacy? | 2016 [Zero Days](URL by Alex Gibney | Documentary detailing claims of American/Israeli jointly developed malware Stuxnet being deployed not only to destroy Iranian enrichment centrifuges but also threaten attacks against Iranian civilian infrastructure. Adresses obvious potential blowback of this possibly being deployed against the US by Iran in retaliation. | 2016 Every Move You Make | The first film to show the consequences of global Internet surveillance by presenting victims and their stories, from Syria to California. We see a community of white-hat hackers collaborating globally to stop these malware attacks. Will the Internet ever be safe and secure? The film includes a heated debate about whether encryption is the answer, or if it will enable terrorism and cybercrime. | 2016 [Digital Dissidents](URL | Digital Dissidents are the warriors of the digital age: Republican patriots, radical anarchists and cyber-hippies fight side by side for transparency and privacy in the digital world. For that, they are in prison, live in exile or have lost their careers and families. While many people celebrate them as heroes, critics, intelligence services and companies condemn their actions as an assault on our security. Why are they doing it? What are their motives? Available on Al Jazeera Youtube channel in two parts : [Part I](URL [Part II](URL 2015 [The Haystack](URL | The Haystack documentary, is a real life investigation into 21st century surveillance in the UK and the Investigatory Powers (IP) Bill currently before Parliament. In light of Snowdens revelations in 2013, both privacy groups and our government agree that the laws surrounding surveillance need to be updated, but public debate and examination of the Bill have been shockingly limited on an issue that impacts us all. The Haystack explores whether the powers set out in this Bill will stop the next terrorist attack, and asks, are we willing to accept an unimaginable level of intrusion before its too late?| 2016 "
