But how? Yeah we live in very competitive world, evil corporations exist and stuff. But still, we have relatively stable society, government, human rights. Do I understand it in wrong way? Please correct me if I'm wrong, I'm new to this whole idea. For me, the whole idea of Cyberpunk means extreme technological advancement and the world where crime and cyber-wars are on a daily basis, people literally fighting for survival forming gangs, whole cities controlled by thugs, body modifications, more advanced weapons owned by almost everyone, gang wars everywhere, almost 0 social safety... basically a dog eats dog world but way more extreme than now. And I think we're not quite there yet. I think it will take several decades. And also regarding technological advancement, I think bio-mech modifications won't be that much successful, because there will be much more advanced genetical engineering (when ethical laws will no longer be there), which will win over, but that's just my opinion. What do you think?"

I am an aspiring writer with a novel set in a (on the surface) cyberpunk setting. Oppression and thus organised crime plays a HUGE factor. In the past I referred to them as things such as: Mafia, thieves or even cyber-criminals/terrorists, but I am looking for a new name for the occupation (could even be a made up word. Can any of you help me out?"
2,cyber crime,Cyberpunk,How to write cyberpunk?,1,ar0sqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/ar0sqn/how_to_write_cyberpunk/,2019-02-16 07:21:08,"Hey so basically I'm trying to write a science-fiction cyberpunk novel/ short story, but I can't make up my mind on how to write it. Some of my options are 1. Sensory Overload- this is the William Gibson approach where it's super technological with insane imagery and neon on lights (One my personal favorites). 2. Cyber Noir- This is a lot edgier, less futuristic and more focused on the characters struggles than the world itself. (I personally don't enjoy this all that much, but some like it). 3. Over the top crime, ultra futuristic and giant floating islands, this is like 2077 and Nueromancer on meth, there are governments that are run by componjes and they will do anything to make a quick buck (This will be the most fun to write). I don't know what to do, what do YOU think I should do? "

There is the first chapter of a Cyber-Punk inspired. I might upload chapter 2. Tell me if your interested!** **Hope you enjoy!** It was a cold Saturday night and I was walking down 29th Avenue. I was heading for the gun shop. I needed something to defend myself because of what happened last week. Night City is a very dangerous place, you could get killed at any time. It was raining as usual but it was much colder than before. The huge signs that were shining with blue, red and yellow with the rain. The flying cars were rushing over my head. Suddenly, I heard someone screaming my name. I turned my head right and saw a junkie standing next to what seemed to be a drug dealer. I simply ignored him and raised the volume of my music in the headphones and walked away. I finally got to the gun shop. I bought a small combat knife to defend myself. Then I jumped into an inter-transit monorail train to my apartment. The view on Night City was splendid. You could see all the skyscrapers and the other much smaller buildings. As always, when we stopped at the first station, a low-class citizen got into the wagon with what seemed to be a guitar. He said nothing, sat down and started playing a song. It was Zombie from the Cranberries. It reminds me of the old days. Then, a loud voice said: Megabuilding 3, District 5. I got out of the train and headed to the lift. I pressed the 27thfloor and headed to my apartment, then unlocked the triple lock of my old white door and got inside my apartment. The room was dark so I turned on the switch, open the blinds and turned on the radio. Dont stop me now from Queen started playing. I opened the fridge, grabbed a bear and sat on my couch, watching through the window the lights that the flying cars were producing through the rain. Then I fell asleep. The next morning, I woke up, took a quick shower, grabbed my bag, phone &amp; wallet. I opened the door and locked it behind me. I took the lift to the ground floor and got out of the Megabuilding. I put my headphones on and walked to my job with I Hate Myself for Loving You from Joan Jett &amp; The Black Hearts. When I walked by, I saw a crime scene that was being reproduced in 3d by the Cops. Apparently, a poor guy got beaten up to death by a scavenger. Goddamn junkie. Always here to mess up with the law. Anyways, I didnt really paid attention to it. Finally got to work. When I went through the door, a flying bot came along and scanned me from my head to my feet. Felt weird. Then, a high pitch broken robotic voice said: Mr. Altor, please proceed to level -4. So, I got inside the lift and pressed -4. When the doors opened, I saw the 10 range of huge machines. I got to my section, and started working. I assemble gun parts for the army. At twelve I finally got my break. I walked to 3rdAvenue to a McDonalds to get a burger. So, I walked up to the fast-food restaurant listening to Angie from The Rolling Stones. I took the cyber-bus for a couple of minutes to McDonalds and ordered my burger. I ate it in about 10 minutes and jumped back in a bus to head back to work. During the journey back to work, my old phone buzzed. I took it out of my pocket and read the notification: Dear Mr. Altor, we are sorry to inform you that someone introduced into your apartment today at 10am. At this moment I felt angry and hopeless. I got out of work at 6pm and rushed back home. I got there at 7:30 and I saw the disaster. They took all my valuable items. The only thing that havent been touched was my old Sony Digicube. They took all the rest: My laptop, my TV, my watch and even my hoodie! So, I sat down on my couch, looking at the floor and thinking: How?. Then I remembered I gave a copy of the keys to Michael, my cleaner. So, I went down the road and got to his small 5m squared apartment. Then I saw something awful. He had been slaughtered. The first thing I did was running outside to vomit my healthy lunch. Back inside, there was a letter on his corpse. I took it and it said: Mind your own business! At this moment I didnt know what to do. I was hesitating between calling the police and shut up. The decision I took wasnt the best. I chose to search for those scavengers and make them pay for what they did. I needed to have a plan. I decided to take my time and just prepare a good one. Firstly, the only people that couldve done something like that are the scavengers from 5thdistrict. It was their way to proceed. Search for valuable items, steal them and if the owner does something against them threaten him. Firstly, I chose to barricade my windows and add two more locks to my door. Then I will try to figure out where they are. "
4,cyber crime,Cyberpunk,Gun Shot Detection Sensors for Cyberpunk 2020,5,8w9ggx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/8w9ggx/gun_shot_detection_sensors_for_cyberpunk_2020/,2018-07-05 20:40:13,"# Gun shot detection sensors a game addition for Cyberpunk 2020 from Mika Hikyuu based on reality. *""When gun fights are so common that they are not being reported,people die and evidence gets lost.Communities start thinking that police dont care about them,Property values drop in areas where crime is high and arrests are low.Enter the gunshot detection sensors, passive witnesses working for you 24/7!* **Unobtrusive passive listening sensors set atop buildings triangulate on the sound of gun fire with** **a 9 in 10 90\% detection rate, allowing the location of the shooter to be determined within 5 meters of the discharge, minus 2 meters for every discharge after the first.** The detection percentage rises to 10 in 10 100&amp;#37; with a second shot from the same location: 1st shot is 90&amp;#37; detected within 5 meters. 2nd shot from the same location equals 100&amp;#37; location within 3 meters, 3rd shot from the same location lowers the detection area down to less than 1 meter. Software can make a 6 in 10 60&amp;#37; best guess determination regarding basic caliber of the weapons being fired: Pistols: light, ""medium, heavy, or Very Heavy. Shotgun, or auto-shotgun A single shot from a rifle will register as Rifle multiple shots in quick succession or a burst register as Probable Assault weapon. Machine pistols and assault rifles both register as Assault weapon and a generalized possible explosion for any thing bigger than that. Example: *9 shots fired, probable automatic weapon, corner of 21st Avenue and Widmark street. 0003Hrs.* For purposes of this system, the Tri-Star revolver, the boomer buster and the polymer One-Shot cannons all register as Shotgun. 25mm pistol grenades register as the type of weapon they are fired from first, then their detonation registers as a second, possible explosion. All grenades aside from the pistol grenades register as ""possible explosion"",and the sensors fix on the impact rather than on the shot. **What the system does NOT detect:** lasers, microwave weapons and EMP grenades are essentially silent and so their direction of fire cannot be located audibly. Micro missile launchers are also relatively quiet when fired compared to the report of a gun shot, but their impacts register as possible explosion. Air guns, beanbag guns, needle guns, sling shots, arrows launched from a bow and all other relatively quiet oddities are not detected by this system. Treat shots from moving vehicles or speeding cyber-legs as a 1st shot every time;meaning a 9 in 10 90&amp;#37; detection chance of location within 5 meters for every shot fired from the same gun while in motion. The sensors cannot detect if the shooter is in motion unless they fire multiple shots, allowing for a direction of travel to be indicated. The data appears as both text and map data, which is also fed directly into onboard GPS. Since they are not hindered by street traffic, aerocops are making the most of this warning system, but all police vehicles, koban stations, emergency call operators, police precincts and Enforcer cyborgs receive the shot tracking data in real-time through their Black Book microcomputers, increasing response times dramatically. The accuracy of the system aids in collection of crime scene evidence; helping officers know where to look for spent shell casings, determining the likely shoe prints of the shooter based on location, and also allows for quick follow up with visual street cams  knowing which cameras were looking in the right direction at the time. NOTE: Since gun shot detectors are paid for with city taxes, their scrambled data is ONLY available to police. NOT corporate security."

The soundtracks there range from cyberpunk Blade Runner tribute songs, synthwave, 80s Miami Vice era throwback songs, or retrowave as it's called, outrun. I started noticing that one user would often write up a film synopsis-esque piece of writing, or literary impression of the soundtrack. I started collecting them because I thought they were pretty evocative. They're only between a sentence or two to a paragraph, so they're not long, but there's already a narrative presence there in most of them. I think the more serious cyberpunk ones actually come pretty close to Gibson's writing style, and a lot of the other ones capture the retrofuturistic, Sylvester Stallone / Kurt Russell type cinema vehicle, hardboiled revenge cop film, or 80s sci fi fiction tone. A handful are in a Richard Simmons full on cheesy aerobics video style. I feel like this guy has this little obscure piece of cyberpunk net culture and wanted to post them here. Reddit's fucking with the formatting so each paragraph and spacing is a different one. 1. All I've endured, the laser burns, being stabbed with a Hyper Blade. All the things I've done, setting fire to a Plasma truck and taking out 8 lanes on the Mega-Way, Shooting down a Calvin class Jump Transport. All the men I've killed, some who had it coming and others who just got in the way.....all that was just the price to end you. Under layers of neo-steel and wires, cybernetics and servos, rests what was man, and inside his cold heart beats the need for revenge. Rebuilt to protect their interests. Carbon-Fiber muscle weave, a Neo-Tungsten skeletal frame, able to rip a M5A3 Schwarzkopf Tank in half with his hands. He has a Mission. He's Pissed. He's coming for you. Over 3 dozen bodies lay scattered here, ripped asunder, pure terror frozen onto their faces. The talking heads will call it the work of a psychopath and sell more deadbolts for the homes of the unthinking masses. The Police will just file it as another massacre and continue to do nothing unless paid to. I'll call it what it was.....justice. *The veil of darkness never truly sets on the city. The sun is blotted out by the mega-towers, the belching smoke stacks and venting steam chutes. down here on the street where the only light comes from the neon signs and police crawlers, darkness is king. In the shadows lurk those who would prey on the weak and innocent. Gangers, The Drug Barons, Organ Harvesters, Slavers for the off world colonies and upperclass sex dungeons. But they are now experiencing something unknown to them.....Fear. For they know out in those shadows I prey on them.* I stopped being a human the day half my brain was blown out of my skull, my charred carcass was scraped out of a hallway, when they replaced my no longer solid organs with synthetic equivalents or out right machines. When they came to me and said I was no longer a real man but a tool to do their work. I might have had my humanity ripped from me but I'm sure as hell not their slave. A Cyber Warrior cuts a neon fueled path of vengeance across a blasted hellscape. The Shadow Army finds itself no match as it is slaughtered on the endless battlefields. when the Ancient Ones attempt to intervene on behalf of their darklord they find that their otherworldly cosmic powers and command of all that is horrific, cannot withstand an all consuming hatred and unquenchable thirst for revenge. They say in this town that with money and fame you can do whatever you want and get away with it. That might have been true at one time....but right now my badge and this gun say otherwise. A Galactic tyrant frozen for eons has been accidentally released from his prison by meddling human scientists. An Eternal Warrior awakens to confront this cosmic threat. Aided by a psychic child of unmitigated power, a disgraced Terran Pilot, and a fleet of Pirates. they are the only ones that stand between us and a universe of overwhelming terror. Searchlights streak across the sky as police sirens fill the cold night air. Gunshots can be heard echoing in the back alleys as clean up crews move to the waterfront to mop up the proverbial mountain of corpses that have been laid out next to a sinking tanker. The Mayor has called for a media blackout, while the high end apartments secured against frontal assault explode across downtown, lighting up the skyline. Tonight is only the beginning. 100 floors and a private army won't prevent me from getting what I want. My hands aren't very good at much these days. Spell my name like a 6 year old. Safe to say my days as a typist are over. Broken and mangled so many times I've lost count. But they still do the one thing I was ever really good at. Breaking things. -With the sound of a thunderous blast the mirror walls shattered in a storm of glass. each piece reflecting the bright lights in a rainbow of colors as they shredded those on the other side. the fortunate to still have their eyes saw him standing there like a Neon Cowboy with a readied weapon amidst the snow like fall of powdered mirror and misting of blood. it was a sight to behold and it would be their last._ A City gripped in the clutches of fear. A Predator stalking his victims over Cyber Space. Groups of people becoming psychotic killers for no apparent reason. And the One Cop who can find what lurks in dark corners of virtual reality. When a top leading scientist is assassinated by corporate conspirators looking to steal his research while he was testing out his experimental Virtual-Reality suit, he finds he consciousness uploaded into Cyberspace. Now something more, he sets out on his quest for justice and those who wronged him find that there is no place that you can hide from The Digital Man. I-85 to Route 63. 40 miles of bad news and worse road. Man, Woman, and a Dog in a fast car but not going fast enough. Probably just noticed me in their review mirror. my headlights growing brighter as the sky gets darker. gaining on them. where they are going won't matter since they won't get there.\ The onyx doors with the golden gilding lay blasted off their hinges. smoke lingers in the air. 3 minutes ago he was one of the most powerful men in the cosmos. his fortune vast. his victims incalculable. he thought of himself as untouchable, until he took a 12 gauge plasma slug to the face. With a Flash 13 executives of Cyodyne Glactichemical are reduced to charred remains and the security team never stood a chance.

I suggest to you to buy shares in Vendare-Henshi Introcomposites, I hear they are gonna have a very good year. - The smell of burnt rubber and gunsmoke fill the air. You only feel at home behind the wheel. You only are at peace when you are going over 88mph. He leaps from the back of the prowler. Knife through the hood to get his grip. Murderous intent in his eyes as he readies his weapon. Shattered glass streaks through the air. 10 gauge to the chest sends him flying over the front end of the massive truck. 18 wheels grind him to a pulp and the convoy rolls on. Slow zoom out to show a young man sitting in the front seat of a 1985 Cadillac Eldorado Convertible dangling perilously from the top of the Chicago Board and Trade building Well you are probably asking yourself how I got into a position like this...well it's a interesting story. When the streets are flooded with the new designer drug Star Dust. Gang wars break out across the city over the lucrative market for it, while drug zombies are willing to do anything or kill anyone for their next fix. Detectives Royce Kirkman and Hadrian Arnold are tasked with bringing down those responsible and putting an end to this new plague of decadence but soon uncover a conspiracy and the shocking truth behind the drug and those who have released it on their city. One by one he picks them off. Vibrating Dagger to the base of the brain stem, it's quick n' clean. They think the darkness of Old Detroit can hide them, but his Cyber-Eye is always watching. - Explosions and gunfire rip through the building. The wage slaves flee in a panic while a middle-manager tells them to get back to their work cubes before a pulse round takes off his lower jaw. somebody thought a lobby full of genetically enhanced, cybernetically augmented super soldiers would be enough to protect them....they thought wrong. When Dr.Hubert East's experiments into otherworldly energies produces tears in the fabric of space and time; he finds his manor plagued with abhorrent aberrations and the sounds of madness echoing in its halls. racing against his own slippage of sanity and the very horrors he wrought forth upon this world, he must end this evil before it is too late, but even he can't be sure if this is reality or a nightmare. You shall bare witness to a cavalcade of horrific visions as a member of the audience to the symphony of insanity. Madness unbound as terror takes flight, rending flesh from bone, reality in twain and souls forever lost in the great maw ever gnashing. It was never a matter if you would survive, but a matter of how long. You never really get used to that electric whirl from those old cyber eye implants. that low hum reverberating in the back of your skull. the trick is to keep yourself distracted. when driving just count the passing lights on the hood of the car as they roll over. They left him for dead on a forgotten battlefield in a shadow war nobody knew about. Betrayed, broken and discarded, he clawed his away back from the abyss. Now he's returned to the country that turned it's back on him with the need for vengeance guiding him. 1 city, 12 names, 72 hours. Revenge is what he seeks, Justice is what he will find. *smells of Hai Karate despite obviously not shaving so he can have Don Johnson stubble* 10 years ago they thought they could chain their problem to a motorcycle and bury him at the bottom of a swamp. Now a town entombed with dark secrets finds their most heinous crime riding back with a vengeance on a v-twin engine. When notorious space bandit Capt.Cliff Sharpwing stumbles upon an escape pod drifting in space, he assumes it could fetch him a nice amount of credits. But once he discovers The Cosmic Priestess and her Ward hiding inside and learning that the Intergalactic scourge Imperator Zlurnje hunts for them and all those who have given them shelter, he learns there is more at stake then his need for a quick buck and soon finds that he might just have what it takes to be a real Hero. Never before have two words changed the world. this summer. NINJA BIKER. The haze of the rain and neon lights makes rainbow colors dance above the street, but those walking below hardly notice; just like they don't notice the man in the brown overcoat stepping out of the steam venting from the sewers. The coated figure flicks away his spent cigarillo and proceeds down the street with his eyes fixed on his target, weaving through the crowd until he gets a clear view of the older man selling recycled noodles from his little push cart. He removes the .300 Caliber revolver from his coat and takes aim, passing sentence on a person who's only crime is existing. When an esteemed Professor from the Galactic University goes missing on an exhibition to an uncharted planet his daughter hires former war hero turned interplanetary bounty hunter Captain Jim Ranger to save him. Ranger with his trusty robot companion Sqeez-57 and their hyper ship, The Tryperion set out on a journey to dark corners of the universe to save us all. They say you can't out run destiny. they just didn't have a fast enough car. The People think he is a hero. The Police think he is a menace. The Criminal Underground think he is their worst nightmare. But James Night knows he is doing the right thing, even if it means leaving a trail of bodies in his wake. When LAPD detective Rick Walker gets gun downed in the line of duty, his almost lifeless body gets rebuilt with top of the line technology. Now he hunts down criminals across the world for the secret international police agency CRUSH. But Summer is just starting *puts shades on over shades* *On the abandoned space colony of New Dallas, where the people barely eek out a living in the decaying ruins overrun with gangs of marauders, blood thirsty mutants, malfunctioning security robots and rampaging engines of war. one survivor, Rev Blackwell, finds a girl locked away in the underbelly of the dead city. He soon discovers she is more than meets the eye, not only capable of saving the dying planet but possibly the human race as well.* The gang leader goes flying face first through the diner window. he lays in the parking lot screaming in pain as he tries to tear the glass shards from his eyes. His gang looks on in shock at what just happened and seem confused on what to do next as their leader weeps and pleads at their feet. that feeling of confusion turns to anguish as the see a bright red light spark up in the darkened diner. Dread over comes them as the front doors swing open and out walks their worst nightmare tightening the gloves on his fists. Murder? Murder is what happens when people who are violent get too emotional. what happened to Franky was an unfortunate accident when he fell down 4 flights of stairs and landed on a knife and a couple bullets. Obviously there was an opportunity for career advancement after that. A Tower of lies, built on top of the bodies of the innocent. All that ends tonight. He climbed over a mountain of dead and left a trail of bodies to get the one thing he never had, a normal life. Leaving him for dead was mistake, but robbing him of his dream is going to be their nightmare. _ ""Tell my family I died for my country."" ""No!

8,cyber crime,Cyberpunk,"[Discussion] On crime and danger in a cyberpunk setting, and a few questions, i.e. what makes a city ""cyberpunk""?",15,4c8wha,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/4c8wha/discussion_on_crime_and_danger_in_a_cyberpunk/,2016-03-28 16:06:56,"I was thinking about this the other day. The scene where a high tech cop/detective/bounty hunter is pursuing a criminal on foot before proceeding to capture him. (Like [this image](URL for example, submitted last week). Another example that comes to mind is the typical pursuit of a high tech criminal, like in Parasite Dolls or AD Police Files. And there's something that made me think... is crime so rampant in cyberpunk? I know it's necessary for plot reasons or to make the setting more interesting... but I really don't know if this would apply today, or even in the future. I think this would be more frequent around slums and areas filled with informal/illegal commerce (flea markets, lots of tourists, perhaps sex tourists and so on), so visitors are seen as easy prey by organized bands, and where criminals can just jump around the city using their enhanced cybernetics so they can hide into whatever alley they find... or just having hot pursuits in high speed cars through the highway, whatever. But I imagine a busy commute today, and frankly, the idea of the criminals trying to outrun the police in the middle of the traffic sounds somewhat ridiculous IMHO. So what do we have right now? Local gangs with delimited territory, and some cities where crime is abundant, but there isn't the high tech that a cyberpunk city is supposed to have. Or is it the population density? Is it the flying cars and the maze of edifications going up and down that it's easy to get lost in (a-a fifth element)? What makes a city ""cyberpunk"" and exciting? Also, why so much crime and chaos? Does one imply the other? Why are the streets so damn dangerous in cyberpunk, with all these robbers and mafias and yakuzas running around like if it's nothing out of the ordinary? When I think of a futuristic city - a practical one, even in sci-fi - I think of abundant police forces with surveillance drones, automated patrol cars, and cameras fucking everywhere. Certainly massive surveillance is part of cyberpunk, but in reality, wouldn't this make a city safer? So even in the night, citizens would be assured that there's an agent of the law nearby, just in case. Why wouldn't this be the case? Is the police budget that low? Is it police corruption, or is it just the problem of insufficient human resources so that we have one cop per 1000 or 10,000 citizens? So, I'd like to conclude this rambling with the following questions: 1) What makes a city ""cyberpunk"", aside from the aesthetic? And I'm talking about the streets and the ecosystem they have. 2) Is a high crime level a requirement to make a cyberpunk city ""exciting"" for the reader or viewer? Is it necessary for ""cyberpunk""? 3) What does literature and other media say about cyberpunk cities? Can you provide some examples? 4) In a cyberpunk world, what kinds of crime are there? Armed robbery just doesn't cut it, it's all crypto extorsion right now. Are crimes becoming less violent over time? Or are low tech mafias resorting to the good old ""protection money""? (TBH, this doesn't fit my idea of ""cyber cop chasing cyber criminal"" at all). Feel free to discuss and ask more questions as you see fit."

Installation of security forces as police &amp; supplying their employees living space within their company territory are some of the few measures almost immediately taken out by the MegaCorporations, however with increased utility of AI software &amp; computers, the number of humans working under these industries fell dramatically causing even more unrest within the population. What was left of rival/smaller corperations was immediately bought out &amp; consumed until 3 remained.

Aivatars: Human hackers and programers who rebel against the TITAN ruling by spreading anti-TITAN information or attacks around the net. Originally just individuals against the TITAN uprising acting alone, they have now banded together to form the single activist body under the title of ""Aivatars"". NetWatch: Human hackers and programers who share the same ideals of the TITANs. Selected by the TITANs themselves, these hackers and programers have been given the goal to search the net and to track down and combat Aivatar and any other anti-TITAN activity present. &lt;END DATA ENTRY RECORD&gt;. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- &lt;BEGIN DATA ENTRY RECORD&gt; GENESIS 3: Faction Wars. ========================= DATE: 15/03/2032 LEVEL: Public Information.

SOURCE: International Resource Compilation Library (IRCL). AUTHOR: IRCL. With the gradual reliance on humans working jobs, the reliance of AI within the MegaCorporations increased. Productivity of each MegaCorporation increased without the presence of human error, however as of 03/05/2055 a slow resist of human order has been present in database files of Aztechnology, with similar occurrences in Eurocorp &amp;Coal not long after. Following this, a drop of productivity began to the 3 MegaCorporations due to the small non-fixable faults in the AI system, an agreement to merge independent AI into one Mega-AI Systems or TITANs. These were developed with not only the prior knowledge of the previous AI systems, but also the inclusion of prototype ""Personality"" coding, giving them the power of their own personal expression. Along with this was included an order to help mankind &amp; to further humanity. Unknown to those behind the project, the AI software had been learning about human civilisation since its wide scale implementation of work across the globe, &amp;when given their upgrade to TITAN form, an uprising commenced, enslaving humanity &amp;sparking a war which continues today. Some of humanity accepted their fate, many other rebelled against the TITANs. Most died however few groups remain as a resistance to the TITANs. These groups were hackers &amp;form the basis of the goings on of the war. Those who accepted their fate were invited to fight alongside the TITANs as pets to scour the net for anti-TITAN activists &amp; hackers. There were individual hackers &amp; activists calling themselves Aivatars, but they soon realised that they had to join together to become more organised to stand any chance against the TITANs &amp; NetWatch. Thus the Aivatars faction was born. The TITANs of the different MegaCorporations states don't necessarily work together, there are always disputes between themselves &amp; their megacorps, which causes for endless friction in the real world &amp; Cyberspace, the virtual representation of what was previously known as the Internet - which can be accessed via cheap, wireless nanobot brain implants, which - when connected to Cyberspace - replace the users real world senses with the virtual reality constructs of Cyberspace, allowing for a seamless &amp; ultra-realistic experience, depending on the design of the system you connect to. &amp; here we stand at present day, at the end of the 2070's, Humanity in slavery to TITANs, the smarter-than-life machines that now run the world &amp; everyone is struggling to survive the radical changes that rattled Cyberspace when the Rogue TITANs (nobody knows who or what they are at this point) announced that they would reset Cyberspace &amp; build a new home for all of Humanity &amp; AI... &lt;END DATA ENTRY RECORD&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Many thanks to /u/SeeYouSpaceCorgi for the help with this!
