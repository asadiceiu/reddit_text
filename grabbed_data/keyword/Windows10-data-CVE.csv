0,CVE,Windows10,Core Isolation/Memory Integrity Error Causes Shutdowns - How and why does it happen and how to fix it?,1,igzk87,https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/igzk87/core_isolationmemory_integrity_error_causes/,2020-08-27 00:11:27,"For some background: I'm not sure exactly how this set of errors/warnings within windows got triggered by an M2 SSD installation but my rig worked flawlessly until that exact day. Upon my first boot up, the PC shutdown within minutes and subsequently a few more times for the next hour while I just observed it's behavior. One of my storage HDD's was not being recognized so I double checked my connections, found a loose plug, went over all others and rebooted to see all was well. I created the two new partitions for the SSD drives and for the next week the PC operated perfectly. Yesterday it shut down again while my partner was just working on the web in Google drive. **What I checked/tried to diagnose:** I ran tests for memory/checked temps/updated GPU drivers. All clear. It's on my to do list to update my BIOS drivers but I presently don't think the issue lies there. Viewing the event viewer system log highlighted some messages: For the shutdown itself I got two errors. **Event ID 6008 - The previous system shutdown at 11:38:24 AM on 8/25/2020 was unexpected**. **Event ID 41 - The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly**. I then checked back further through the log to check for any warnings/errors showing up close to the shutdown itself and found this: **The hypervisor did not enable mitigations for CVE-2018-3646 for virtual machines because HyperThreading is enabled and the hypervisor core scheduler is not enabled. To enable mitigations for CVE-2018-3646 for virtual machines, enable the core scheduler by running ""bcdedit /set hypervisorschedulertype core"" from an elevated command prompt and reboot**. I also confirmed that on the day of my SSD installation, this warning occurs just before each of those several restarts. From what I've read in Windows documentation (and frankly don't understand) and on forums like [Technet](URL is that a portion of an implemented security measure concerning core/memory was enabled, while a required process was not, which I speculate gets ""tripped"" for some reason and the shutdown occurs. What I'm trying to sort out is getting an ELI5 on what exactly this set of processes really means, how such an error can shut a PC down randomly and what the ramifications are of enabling this compared to disabling them altogether? **In case it's important, here's my PC Hardware:** - Windows 10 (Build 2004) - [Motherboard](URL - 64 GB DDR4 RAM - i7-8700k - NVIDIA GTX Duke 1070ti 8GB - 256GB Crucial M4 SSD (Windows boot drive) - 2 x 1TB HDDs (Forget brand) - 2 x WD Black SN750 NVMe M2 SSD - 750 Watt PSU (Forget Brand but it has a few years on it now)"
1,CVE,Windows10,Experiencing random shutdowns? Can't Enable Memory Integrity? Own a Western Digital portable drive? Please Read This!,1,ijxe38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/ijxe38/experiencing_random_shutdowns_cant_enable_memory/,2020-08-31 22:51:52,"I've spent the better of a week and a half digging around trying to figure out why my rig suddenly started to shut off and instantly restart on me on the day of an M2 SSD installation and intermittently onward. Reviewing my Windows [Event Log](URL highlighted one particular error: - Log warning - The hypervisor did not enable mitigations for CVE-2018-3646 for virtual machines because HyperThreading is enabled and the hypervisor core scheduler is not enabled. To enable mitigations for CVE-2018-3646 for virtual machines, enable the core scheduler by running ""bcdedit /set hypervisorschedulertype core"" from an elevated command prompt and reboot. If you refer to the log screenshots, within a few seconds of each time I experience a shutdown, this error appears. Not knowing exactly what any of the above truly means beyond ""This stuff better protect mah stuff I think"" I disabled memory integrity in my security settings and have been reboot free since. That being said, it still irritated me to all hell that while I seem to have gotten around the shutdowns, I haven't found out why it's happening or what's wrong in the first place. In my continued digging I may have found the big picture narrative. If you review this [WD forum thread](URL and this [Microsoft Forum post](URL you'll see that enabling memory integrity causes Windows some issues when the user has previously/or currently utilized a portable WD HDD. There is a particular software driver that has not been updated by WD which when left on our system, blocks memory integrity from being enabled properly. As per the posts above it is located and named as follows: **The incompatible driver is the below Western Digital driver, which is located here: C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\wdcsam.inf_amd64_7ce69fc8798d6116** If this is something you see in your system, plug in the portable HDD, and uninstall everything via device manager. I'm hopeful that after everything has been removed, enabling core isolation/memory integrity should be doable, and that the random shutdowns being reported will too, be at an end. For anyone who reads this and starts exploring, I'd appreciate getting some details on your process to better document whether this ends up being **a solution**."

5,CVE,Windows10,Using Dism repair without access to Windows Update(Microsoft)?,1,ex2fxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/ex2fxj/using_dism_repair_without_access_to_windows/,2020-02-01 18:09:13,"I work in a secured environment where patching is restricted (so no Microsoft Updates), and there are multiple policies in place to prevent even communication (so configuring local group policy to use Windows Update instead of WSUS for dism repair won't work). I expect even firewall rules are configured this way. So it would be too much effort to dismantle all of that to get dism to work. I have seen this and will attempt it: [URL But with the recent hubub about CVE-2020-0601, it's been embarrassingly clear that many computers suffer an issue where Cumulative Updates in particular simply fail. Although for a smaller few, even Servicing Stack Updates will fail. Dism has been especially good for me in my last job, and I'm hoping I can figure out how to use it again. We primarily use a Golden Image. A computer is built to specifications and hardened, with certain components removed (enough that sfc /scannow will always state that there is component store corruption), certain software installed, and then it is sysprepped and captured into a modified WIM file. I attempted a multitude of methods to try to use dism with that golden image as a repair source. Mounting the WIM file on the computer, using it directly, booting to WinPE and attempting an offline repair, slaving the drive onto another computer and using dism. Never had any luck and it would always error out. [URL I read up on that and feel like it could potentially explain my failures. The Golden Image is not maintained. We get one image for each feature update, and it stays that way. Any future updates are included as separate files to be applied to it. Even imaging will use wsus offline to patch it. It sounds like it might work if I simply inject the latest CU into the WIM file and then try again, but I have to ask if a heavily modified Golden Image can be used as a repair source? SFC always seems to think it's corrupted, so I don't know if dism finds things missing, thinks the source is no good (like say if we stripped out Microsoft Edge), and simply throws an error rather than continue to try to fix what it can? Hoping someone bumped into this before."
