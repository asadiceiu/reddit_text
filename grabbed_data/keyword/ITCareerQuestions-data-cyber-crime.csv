I am looking for some experienced IT people who could recommend me a job/career path based upon my degrees, personality and interests. I have the following degrees/certificates: * Bachelor Computer Science Engineering * Masters in Business Administration (Specialisation: Management and IT) * Certificate Computer and Cyber Crime Professional + CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) My personality: * Not anti-social but experiences stress around people, especially strangers * Not much of a multi-tasker, usually very focussed on the job/problem at hand * Likes doing/creating new things, especially with a great impact potential * Easy learner when it comes to things I need to use to reach a goal, hard learner when it comes to acquiring general textbook knowledge My interests: * Web development * Finance (algorithmic/regular trading) * Videogames (creating, Augmented Reality) What I look for in a job: * A good work/life balance * A sense of growth over time I know all this information is probably all over the place, but that's exactly why I felt like asking. There are so many types of jobs in IT, within so many companies using IT for different purposes, that I'm feeling kind of lost about what direction I can, could or should take. What I'm hoping to get out of this post is that someone would say something like ""Given X, Y and Z, why not do some *cool job I never even thought about?*"". Feel free to ask some more info if needed. Thanks in advance."
1,cyber-crime,ITCareerQuestions,Recent graduate looking for advice,1,gzugql,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/gzugql/recent_graduate_looking_for_advice/,2020-06-10 05:45:13," Like the title says I am a recent graduate from a university. I have a B.S. in Computer Science. I really love working with database and want to get into that field. I recently had two interviews with one company but they ended up going with a different candidate because they had more experience with larger databases. I interned with a states cyber crime unit and made them a small database to keep track of their cases and evidence, but that only had like 6-8 tables in it. Does anyone have any recommendations on how to go about getting this experience? Any advice is greatly appreciated."

My current job is inspecting freight and it's very boring, however it's really easy and I make about $57,000 a year. But it's too boring and I love computers. Always have loved technology. My experience isn't going to get me a great job, I understand that I'll probably need to get a help desk job and move up. My experience is I've built a few PC's, fixed some, reinstalled windows. Made my desktop into a Plex server. Dabbled with Linux, I need to learn Linux more and want to learn it. At my current job, everyone comes to me with email and Microsoft office problems. Basically I have personal experience, no professional experience. I was enrolled in a Networking program at a tech school in 2013, dropped out and took my current job. I was going to enroll in WGU because it's cheap. I'm debating whether it's worth it to enroll, get a degree and certs. Or just get certs and work my way up from the bottom. I was thinking of getting CompTIA A+, network+, then maybe AWS or something. My dream job would be digital forensics with law enforcement. Or cyber crime. That would combine both of my passions. In summary, my questions are: 1. Is WGU worth it or just get a few certs, if so which to focus on first? 2. How do you show experience when applying and interviewing? Because I could imagine someone hiring may not really understand IT, and would sound like gibberish to them explaining your personal experience with computers. 3. Digital Forensic degrees are extremely expensive and honestly look shady, does anybody work in the field? And what does it take to get in? Thanks everyone, this is a great sub with helpful people."

I've gotten my foot in the door working in a SOC doing some penetration testing and offensive stuff(vulnerability assessments, metasploit, scripting, etc.) and I'm looking at the future to see what kinds of higher level positions I might want to align myself with. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like there are a whole lot of things that utilize pentesting skills beyond being a pentester. I would really like to stay on the offensive side if possible because I enjoy it and am good at it, but as far as salary and growth is concerned, it looks like my options are limited. Surely there are some FBI or government positions where I can fight bad guys and be like a cyber super-hero, right? There's gotta be investigations, intelligence gathering, and social engineering against criminal organizations, human traffickers, domestic threats, etc. Would be very cool to use some of the skills I've learned and put them to good use in this way. I've looked on FBI, NSA, DHS, USAJobs websites, but they are annoyingly(understandably) vague about these kinds of positions. What job titles might I be looking for? How might I align myself for these positions in the future?"

I am in need of some advise. I am currently working in the UK banking industry within financial crime (3 years exp). I'm 27 years old and now at a stage where I feel I want to delve into a more IT related role in security, perhaps a Cyber Security role. I have less than a year experience in IT, however I studied Computing (coding) as part of my A levels. I have a degree which is in a non related subject, and many years of working experience in different fields; some where I have had to use basic IT skills. I am currently studying for my CompTIA Sec+ exam, which I hope to complete in the next few weeks. I am also looking into completing my CISSP course afterwards. my main questions are: 1) is it too late for me to get into cyber security. 2) what types of jobs will I be looking at securing with the above certs. 3) any other advise on what certs I could potentially complete. Thanks guys! :) "
10,cyber-crime,ITCareerQuestions,How can a Cyber Security Engineer actually make a company money (or even save them money). Other than the typical answer of by helping the company not loose money by becoming a victim of Cyber crime,0,81a8vf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/81a8vf/how_can_a_cyber_security_engineer_actually_make_a/,2018-03-02 11:26:18,I think this is a typical thing that comes up when a developer/engineering infrastructure manager at your business says that you as a CyberSecurity engineer cannot contribute to making or saving the company money. Other than the common things like we can help the company or users not become a victim of cybercrime etc. (I know this is very general). This question came up in a meeting today where this manager asked our group a question to give him a specific example of how anybody on the security team can save or make the company money through a project that we have done...... I have heard this come up a few times and it seems like a very 1 sided question.
11,cyber-crime,ITCareerQuestions,Just starting my IT career and not sure whether or not I am on the correct path.,5,7s87ud,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/7s87ud/just_starting_my_it_career_and_not_sure_whether/,2018-01-23 06:24:14,"Hi r/ITCareerQuestions: I am in need of some advice as to where I should go to start/further my IT career. First a little bit of background: I am a 24 year who has just finished his B.S. in Criminal Justice (Dec 2017). However, I realized about 3/4 of the way through my degree that I wanted to do something more tech related but I did not want to waste my time or money so instead of restarting a different degree I added on a Cyber Investigation Specialization to the degree as well as a Minor in Cyber Security since it would only set me back 1 year rather than another 4 years (At that point it would have been the 4th time I changed my major). Fast forward a few weeks and I have landed a low level position at Best Buy as a Geek Squad Consultation Age. My experience in TI/Tech are limited to personal experiences (about 5 years since I started to dabble in IT/Tech area): * building and maintaining my PC/Devices * Troubleshooting/diagnosing/fixing my own PC/Devices * Trouble shooting/diagnosing/fixing friends and family PC/Devices * Reading tech forums * Basic Linux commands * Specialization/Minor as stated above. My current plan is to work there until: * a) my partner finishes her degree in about a year, * b) I finish a few CompTIA Certs (A+, Net+, and Sec+), * c) I get another (preferably better) job. Eventually when my partner is done we both want to end up around the DC/Virginia area. I eventually want to work Tech/IT/LEO/Cyber-Crime on the Federal level. I am currently studying for the A+ Cert but the more I study the more I have realized that it just very basic fundamentals that should already be known by some one who is looking to get in to the Tech/IT field. Most of the non-basic stuff like firewalls and IP seems like a review of the beginning of my Net-Sec classes from my Minor. * Is it worth my time and money to actually go through and actually pay to take both parts of the A+ Cert? I'm not saying the A+ Cert is useless, quite the opposite. This information is a must know for any one who wants a job in the Tech/IT field. It is a great review of the material and I'm glad I pick up a book on it, but that's all it is, a review for me. Is it going to be worth the money to get the A+ Certification given how expensive they are? I feel pretty competent in the areas that the A+ Cert covers. The Net+ and Sec+ seem to be more in the line of what I should be going for. * How valuable are each Certifications (A+, Net+, Sec+)? * Are there other Certs I should be focused on getting? * How relevant/valuable are the Cicso Certs? * Should I just jump off the whole Certification Band-Wagon? I read a [post form about a year](URL ago that made me feel like Certifications are only about as good as you are competent. Like you can pass a million certifications but without the experience and ability to put the information to use, they are worthless. So again, should I forget about the certifications and just get as much experience as possible? Don't the upper level jobs require or prefer you to have certain Certs? I feel pretty competent in the areas that the A+ Cert covers I do apologize for the length of this post and thank you to any one who has made it this far. I welcome all and any advice, questions and comments! Thank you again."
