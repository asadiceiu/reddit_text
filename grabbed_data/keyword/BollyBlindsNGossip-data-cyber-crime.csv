They targeted her, abused her, trolled her and a few even gave her death threats. Reacting to trolling, Meera said: ""I conducted an Ask Meera' session on Twitter and a fan asked me about my favourite actor from the south film industry. I said Mahesh Babu. Then somebody asked if I liked Junior NTR, and I said I don't know him and I'm not a fan. That's it. As soon as I said that, I was bombarded with abuses, murder threats, rape threats, character assassination and threats against my parents. Some morphed my face with porn actors. I've got close to 30,000 abusive tweets so far."" Meera is extremely angry to see such disgusting behavior of netizens. She added: ""Is there no freedom of choice and expression left in today's social media world? How can it be a crime to not be somebody's fan? We can't possibly love everybody. ""I've been tagged a whore, porn star, bitch and what not for just expressing my opinion on not being a Junior NTR fan! It's unfortunate. I've been given threats of gang rape, wishes that my parents die of Covid-19. Is this a civilised society? I am angry, but not scared. I've been constantly talking about women issues and here I face one myself,"" she said. Meera has also filed a cyber complaint against the abusive trollers. ""I am already in talks with the cyber cell team. I've always advocated that women should fight for themselves and stand against what's wrong. Then how can I not do anything about this! You cannot character assassinate a women, give threats, and abuse her for sharing her choice. I have to raise my voice against such fan clubs. These are the kind of people who go out and commit rapes and murders. ""I feel sad for such stars who have such twisted fan base, is this what stardom is? I think a star should address such fan clubs and insist that they refrain from such hooliganism. But they don't do that. Their fans are openly discussing gang rapes and murders and they also use their DPs, but stars just stay quiet,"" Meera concluded.

35,cyber-crime,BollyBlindsNGossip,"Cyber criminals target people seeking free streams of movies, TV shows",1,hk0g8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/BollyBlindsNGossip/comments/hk0g8r/cyber_criminals_target_people_seeking_free/,2020-07-03 02:42:54," With people stuck indoors, the streaming of movies and TV shows has skyrocketed since the start of the lockdown. Now, online scammers have begun gaming internet searches to lure unsuspecting users to shady websites and trick them into clicking on links that install malware - malicious software - on their computers or phones. The Maharashtra police have now launched an investigation into this racket after receiving several complaints. An initial probe has revealed that many such websites are hosted on proxy servers abroad to allow those behind them to evade detection. Type in watch, download or stream into Google, followed by the name of a recent movie or TV show, and chances are the first page of results will include links to suspicious-looking websites with links that promise to let you watch the movie or TV show of your choice for free. Click on these links at your own peril, however, as you may end up downloading malware onto your computer that could steal your private information, such as your bank account and credit card details, or take control of your microphone or webcam. To maximise the number of potential victims, cyber crooks track which movies or TV shows are most popular at any given time and promise these for free on their websites. Yashasvi Yadav, special inspector general, Maharashtra Cyber police, said, Cyber criminals know the landscape of internet usage in India and have been targeting users who search for ways to watch popular television shows and films such as Delhi Crime, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Mardaani 2, Narcos, Lost, Akoori, Fauda, Panchayat, Ghoul, Mindhunter and Inception. All of these works are currently on the cyber polices list of top 10 web risks for movies and television shows. This means they are among the most sought-out movies and shows that also have a high risk of leading a user to a malicious site. The mostwatched movies and shows change with time, so these lists are updated as and when required, Yadav said. The malicious sites came under the polices scanner after they received several complaints from victims, he added. The police have also found that many of these sites are being run on proxy servers or virtual private networks (VPNs) to evade detection, a source told Mirror. Most of the malicious sites are run on proxy servers hosted in countries such as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, North Korea and Iraq, from where it is difficult to get details of the identities of the culprits. Different counties have different privacy laws and there is a reluctance to share such information because of legal complications, the source added. Apart from this, the scammers typically use stolen bank passwords and card details in ways that create complex money trails. For instance, the stolen passwords might be used to make online purchases at American or European e-commerce sites, the source said. Yadav said that such malware is known as bait malware as it lures potential victims with a seemingly innocuous offer - a free, albeit illegal download - to steal their sensitive data. Hackers and malware creators are targeting users searching for illegal streams. Many of these illegal streaming sites are embedded with malware disguised as pirated video files, Yadav added. [URL"
36,cyber-crime,BollyBlindsNGossip,Poonam Pandey files criminal case against Raj Kundra &amp; associates- 8/02/2020,1,f3uc2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/BollyBlindsNGossip/comments/f3uc2a/poonam_pandey_files_criminal_case_against_raj/,2020-02-15 03:11:00,"Over the past six months, life has become a nightmare for Poonam Pandey. The actress alleges that she has been inundated with calls  at odd hours  from across India and even Karachi, requesting her to strip. It all began in June last year, says Poonam, when her number, along with the tagline, Call me, I will strip for you, was leaked on her app. According to the actress, her app was managed by Raj Kundras company, as she had entered in an agreement with them in March 2019. However, Poonam claims that she terminated it a month later. She has now accused them of continuing with the app, in spite of her terminating the contract, and also releasing her personal number on it, which has resulted in her being hounded with numerous calls. Poonam has now moved Bombay High Court to file a criminal case against Kundra and his associates, who collaborated with her for the app. However, Kundra told BT that he had exited the company (which managed the app) in December 2019. Poonams Allegations: When BT spoke to Poonam on this matter, she said, I collaborated with the company for an app named after me in March 2019. We had agreed upon a certain percentage of the revenue generated by the app to be given to me. However, I realised certain discrepancies in revenue sharing and hence, decided to terminate the contract. I also informed them about the same via an email. All hell has broken loose since. They continue to post my pictures and videos on the app. To my horror, they also leaked my personal mobile number along with messages like Call me now as I am free to talk and Call me now. Let us talk and I will strip for you on the app. After that, I started receiving calls from all over, not in dozens but thousands, at odd hours, asking me for explicit services. People started sending me pornographic images and videos. I even left the country for three months hoping that the situation will become normal on its own. However, as soon as I landed back, I started receiving calls and obscene messages all over again. Sometimes, I would get calls where I could only hear heavy breathing from the other side. These callers claim to know my address, too. I changed my number, but after I messaged Saurabh Kushwah (one of the associates of the app company, who is one of the accused) from my new number, asking him to refrain from uploading my pictures and videos on the app, I started receiving calls and messages on that number, too."" My right to live and privacy has been affected. You cant subject me to this treatment The actress said that she approached the police in December 2019. My statement was recorded on December 7, 2019, at Bandra police station. Since they refused to lodge an FIR against Raj Kundra and his team, I had no option, but to move Bombay High Court. I have filed a writ petition  a criminal case  against Raj Kundra, his associate Saurabh Kushwah and my former manager Sonu Lakhwani. I will approach the cyber-crime cell, too. I am going through this nightmare just because I refused to work with them. I am living under constant threats of abduction, rape, murder and acid attack. My right to live and privacy has been affected. Just because I am Poonam Pandey, you cant subject me to this treatment. I am what I am in my world. People can call me controversys favourite. I don't have a problem with that, but you cant disrespect me and threaten my existence, she said. Poonam's lawyer Anand S Jondhale said, The police didnt cooperate with her. So, around a month ago, we moved court and filed a petition for registration of an FIR against them and for due compensation for the mental agony caused. We have also served the notice to the accused through the court. Poonams allegations are false and baseless Meanwhile, Saurabh Kushwah has filed a statement at Bandra police station, stating that the breach was in fact from Poonams side and the company wasnt too pleased with the content uploaded by her on the app, as they were obscene, erotic and objectionable. They have also claimed that it was their decision to terminate the contract. They have denied all allegations levelled against them by Poonam, including that of leaking her number on the app. When contacted, Saurabh said, These allegations are false and baseless. We have not yet received any legal notice or petition from the court, so we will not be able to comment on it. We have cooperated with the authorities concerned and provided all required details. We will follow the due process of law and take steps accordingly. Raj Kundra said, I had invested in a company called Armsprime Media last year, which makes apps for celebrities. I am not aware of the petition as I exited the venture in December 2019 with a sale to the current shareholders. Lawyer Thakur Arjun Singh, who represents Armsprime Media, stated, We have just learnt that Poonam has filed a petition in Bombay High Court. We havent been served a copy of it, yet. The matter has neither been listed nor heard. We will deal with it once we receive a copy of the petition. As far as her allegations are concerned, there is no substance in them. She has been paid in excess  an amount of `60 lakh  as per the agreement in accordance of the revenue share. Just because Raj is an investor in Armsprine, she is trying to extort money by misusing criminal law. She has a civil remedy available if she feels there is a discrepancy in payments but dragging everyone in a criminal case is malicious and mischievous. Source: URL"
