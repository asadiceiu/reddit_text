1,cyber crime,Scams,My friend is being extorted by a group in Burkina Faso - advice please!,1,gyeznl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/gyeznl/my_friend_is_being_extorted_by_a_group_in_burkina/,2020-06-08 02:03:45,"Hi everyone. My buddy made a blunder of a mistake and a group from Burkina Faso are extorting him by threatening to send a video of him masterbating to all of his Facebook friends. They've doctored the video sample they sent him to include a girl that looks to be underage. My friend, by no means, is anywhere close to a pedo, so please do not make this suggestion. He's reported the cyber crime to the FBI and filed the ic3 documentation on their website as well. Additionally, he's hired a 3rd party firm to help investigate and scrub. The group has contacted his immediate family members with a link to the gif file, but Facebook removed the account/messages prior to the link being opened. What else can he do? I've exhausted all of the suggestions I have and most of the articles I've found are relating to scams where there is no actual video, but they have sent him the video. This started on Friday 6/5, they demanded a $1k payments then reduced to $200. He was supposed to send this morning by 940am via a money transfer site hosted by a German company, but I helped him give some excuse that bought him an additional 24 hours to tomorrow 6/8. Can anyone provide me some information that I can share with him? TIA!!!"
2,cyber crime,Scams,OkCupid Hangout scam: Help! caught on cam masturbating,1,halg8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/halg8u/okcupid_hangout_scam_help_caught_on_cam/,2020-06-17 16:05:05,"Before anyone tells me, let us first all agree I am very dumb and stupid. I don't know how I could have been these horny and fell for this! This happened to me today morning. Location: New York! So, I matched a girl (100% a guy) on okcupid and she asked for my full name and all. She was visiting her relative from Russia (red  1). She wanted us to move to Hangouts (red  2) and I agreed to do that. Her reply were slow and there were 5-6 pics so I thought it might be legit (stupid me). Then we moved to hangout and she asked if I am single or married (red  3). She asked later for a video call and I stupidly agreed and she started stripping. I also masturbated and then screen pops up with my recorded video of me. They found my FB account &amp; my account had friend list public. She threatened to send it to all my friends &amp; family till I don't send $1500. So, what happened was I tried negotiating and she said you think I am kidding, let me send it. She tried to send it but FB threw an error because I deactivated my FB ID. Scammer said do you think deactivating can save you, it is too late now. Not even the cops can save you! Scammer was correct as friend list was scraped before my deactivation. I got so freaked out and said fine I will pay. I went to Western Union and made a money order to Philippines. I was stupid to share the receipt that had my other real information on it but luckily information on there is outdated as I have moved and those things are incorrect. I was in New York and she sent me couple of Western Unions open near me 24x7 as it was night. I went stupidly, got the cash and made a payment. Now I thought what's stopping her from not deleting the video even after I pay? The video chat kept on going for 4-5 hours. They were not able to withdraw the money because it was night in Philippines. The guy wanted to sleep so kept the video call on and slept. I thought fuck it, let me cancel western union (thank god for presenting the opportunity to cancel the payment). I cancelled western union and told the guy you know what, I don't really care even if you share it because I reported you to FBI Cyber Crime, Interpol and you are anyways traced. Good luck hiding. I blocked all the contact, my FB is deleted and I have no other footprint. I read this sub and has a Google alert for my name and told all my friends to not accept any FB friend request from me. What are the chances scammer will follow through? Scammer and I don't have any line of communication! What are the chances of video being still sent?"

7,cyber crime,Scams,I paid a blackmailer on paypal,2,dhked2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/dhked2/i_paid_a_blackmailer_on_paypal/,2019-10-14 13:38:25," Hi. I did something stupid and fortunately, I stopped doing it the second time. Going back a few weeks ago, I was on a website (I won't mention it) looking to ask girls who are adults to make content videos. And before I proceed with anything, I always ask their age, because I take that seriously, no matter where they are from. So I go to this one girl, and I ask her age and ask if she wanted to make a video for me. She agreed to do it, I paid her and did not hear from her for a few days. Only thing I got was a pic of her bottom. So, I deleted my gmail account because I have been scammed before and I was tired of it. A few days later, I get an email from paypal from someone, asking to give her extra money. I get confused at first then found out it was the girl I hired to do it. She said she did the video with extra stuff, but with what I didn't ask her for. She kept pleading and asking me to give her an extra $20 dollars, and I said no because I told her I already paid to what we agreed on, and I never asked for extra stuff on the video. This is where I should have stopped talking to her. She threats me to expose my information and says she got it. I'll admit, I was scared, because I have never been blackmailed with girls making video content. She kept pushing me until I actually gave in. She even upped the price to $50 dollars. I had to ask someone for money because I was scared. I didn't know what was going to happen if she would actually do that. So I paid her, and she said it was the wrong account, and demanded me to pay her again. I didn't want to, so I paid her another $70 dollars. I'm an idiot. I pay her and she promises she will delete all my information. I took her word for it. Today she sends another request for $120 dollars. I was scared a little but then actually laughed. I knew she was scamming me. So I told her I wasn't going to pay and if she kept doing it, she would report me and use my information for united scams or something like that. She kept begging and kept sending requests and it was annoying. So I decided to stall her while I had to delete my gmail accounts with sites i signed up for, just in case. She kept going on how I broke the law and how I was a sexual pervert asking young girls for videos, then changing her story saying that she was a minor and i was a rapist and stuff like that.... The fact is that she agreed to do it, and she was of age. I always ask if they are 18 or older. If not, I don't do business with them. She's 22 years old, if you wanted to know. She said other stuff like she has an uncle who was an agent and was going to report her to him. Finally I just sent her a message saying that I wasn't going to pay her, and I have her info and if she were to do something stupid, I would report her to the cyber crime division. I'm ok with it now, but I need to know, would she actually do something like that? And if she did, should I report her? I have her email. The thing is, she's in Venezuela and I am in the us, so I don't know the laws about that. Truth is I never got the video and I didn't want it, and I could have done a chargeback, but I deleted my paypal account as well. If you need to know I am 28 years old, and as far as I know, we were both consenting adults who agreed to do something, but she never followed through.."

I did get a friend request from an attractive girl on facebook. I accepted the request and our chatting started. She talked like a very genuine girl and requested me to call over skype. I followed her instructions and did so. Then something gone wrong and we were both naked on screen. After few moments I received my nude video on skype along with list of my family and friends of facebook. Then I was asked for 1000$ otherwise they will send that video to the listed people. I suddenly panicked because in the list there were my sister, sister in law and niece too. And I requested them to delete it. They finally came down to 500 and I was about to pay them. Then I realized giving money does not guarantee that they will do so. They may ask for more money. And I collected my courage and told them that I have my father in cyber crime divison and has very strong link over law enforcement agencies around the world and they can be easily tracked and be punished (which was just made by me). Then I blocked so called her on Skype and Facebook plus I made some security changes in my facebook account.

10,cyber crime,Scams,Sextortion Scams how to stop them.,1,cdq2ba,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/cdq2ba/sextortion_scams_how_to_stop_them/,2019-07-16 10:50:57,"&amp;#x200B; Well first if people are pressing you on the internet to have your phone number, social media account or email account don't give it to them. The less information someone has about you the harder it is to get blackmailed. If someone is requesting to see your face via webcam don't show it. There goal is to make you open up to them and then scare you with fear once the scammer has the information he or she needs. Recently Sextortion Scamers are on the raise with bitcoin or foreign bank being used for the scam. Below are some old links exampling what is happening. Along side this Facebook has been working hard to take down fake Facebook accounts in 2019. Since accounts are getting taken down scammers are loosing a source of income. If you fall for scam don't pay up find where the scammer is posting the black mail and report it on that site. Also contact your local law enforcement and give them copy of emails or social media accounts that are posting this content. If you know the social media websites the scammer is posting this blackmail you find ways to contact the social media site so they can black list the person creating these accounts or postings. If you obtain a IP address or MAC address of the scammer you can report it to any government law enforcement agency which will make it easier for them to track. Note once its out there is may stay the for years to come if you don't report it as soon as possible. Its better not to pay the scammer especially you found a way to keep them from contacting you. Scammer may at most if you don't pay post your blackmail 5 to 10 different social media accounts once they realize you aren't paying they will stop posting cause its wasting their time. If you pay them they may ask for more money or threaten to post again later down the road. If this happens tell your family or friends they may see something they may not want to see. Suggestion google search yourself every couple days for solid 6 months. As long as you report to the law enforcement and the social media sites about the content out there about yourself they will do their best to remove this information online. If the content pops up on porn site dont worry about it. If friend or family member seen you flag it off as a joke and say something like, ha damn that looks like me. How many likes did this get.confidence is key. If someone sees your blackmail dont worry its just as embarrassing for other people to see it. They may not mention it when they see you in person. [URL [URL If you been fooled by the scammer but, some how smart enough to track down the scammer you could find a way to install a (RAT) program on their devices and stop them completely. Note if you go this route is can be illegal and an government body can charge you with sextortion crimes or other forms of cyber crime as well, if the goverment body find records that another device was connecting to the scammer's device."
11,cyber crime,Scams,Project Finance Loan Scam,6,b5d4tc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/b5d4tc/project_finance_loan_scam/,2019-03-26 03:52:54," In early September 2018, our group was contacted by a business broker named Gregory Lane Christie. He introduced the Project Finance Loan structure of a Surety Bond backed loan at a low interest rate. The surety bond would require a pre-funding payment of 2.3% of the total loan amount of the project. In our case, the Surety Bond provider was Satex Insurance Company SRL, located in Milan, Italy, with the main principal being Mr. Martin Laurence. The Lender for our loan would be Siemens Financial Services, with main office located in Munich, Germany, with the main principal being Mr. Sandy Rabuazzo, who can be found on a Bloomberg report to be the Managing Director of Commercial Business Finance, Siemens Financial Services, Inc. Additional Brokers were soon involved in the Loan transaction, with their names being Waathiq Ndaw ( a US citizen we believe to be residing in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam ) and Quentelle Barton ( a US Citizen we believe to be residing in Dickinson, Texas ). Ms. Barton was presented by Sandy Rabuazzo as being the US broker and representative of the Siemens Financial Services Division in Munich, Germany. Upon the first discussions with Mr. Christie, he claimed that his group had funded many loans ( over $1 Billion in total ) in many countries using their Surety Bond Insured Loan platform. As we moved forward with the transaction with the entire team, including Mr. Rabuazzo and Mr. Laurence, on emails and conference calls, it soon became apparent that the three person broker team had funded ZERO loans anywhere using their international loan platform. Checking on the internet, we could find references to Sandy Rabuazzo as working at the Siemens Financial Services SFS division of Siemens, and also of Martin Laurence being the principal of Satex Insure Co SRL in Milan, Italy. Both companies had websites. Satex Insure Co SRL was found to have some business registration and/or licensing in Italy. During this time we were supplied Passport numbers from Sandy Rabuazzo and Martin Laurence. From September 2018 until December 2018, a large number of emails regarding the loan transaction were generated and circulated between our team, Mr. Martin Laurence, Mr. Sandy Rabuazzo, and the 2 brokers, Mr. Ndaw and Ms. Barton. Our group requested to speak with a Borrower who had previously been funded by the Siemens / Satex Lender &amp; Surety Bond team. Mr. Sandy Rabuazzo of the SFS division of Siemens put our team in contact with a person supposedly from the Czech Republic who verbally verified recently receiving the first tranche of a loan for $151MM. In the same timeframe, a number of both loan and surety bond contracts were reviewed and edited by all parties. Included in the Surety Bond contract were clauses such as: &amp;#x200B; 1. If the loan didnt fund, the 2.3% paid by the Borrowers to Satex Insure CO SRL would be refunded; 2. The Siemens Financial Services Loan would be funded by January 2019. In December 2018, following approval of the final Loan Agreement by the Lender, Siemens Financial Services, and approval of the Lender of the Surety Bond supplied by Satex Insurance Company SRL, our team believed that our Project Loan was ready to be funded, and were strongly urged by all three brokers: Mr. Christie, Mr. Ndaw, and Ms. Barton to wire the 2.3% Surety Bond fee to Satex Insure Co SRL. The wiring instructions were first to send to a Jonathan Lucky in the Netherlands we had never heard of but Satex Insure Co SRL stated this was the CFO for Satex Insure Co SRL. At that point our team tried to make arrangements to fly to Europe and meet both Mr. Rabuazzo and Mr. Laurence, but were told they were too busy and were often travelling, and would be happy to meet with us in a month or two after they funded the first Loan. We were given new wiring instructions to a Satex Insure Co SRL account at Banco Posta, an Italian government owned bank, so our Team did finally wire the 2.3% Surety Bond Fee to a Satex Insure Co SRL account. At this time we were notified by Mr. Rabuazzo from Siemens Financial Services (SFS) that due to various U.S. taxes and U.S. anti-money laundering laws, we were instructed to fly to London England and open an account in a Citibank Branch in the United Kingdom (UK). Once that was done, then our loan funds would be transferred immediately to our Citibank account from a Siemens Financial Services account at the same branch, leaving the importation of the funds to the USA, and all its associated paperwork up to our team, the borrowers. It should be noted that we were requested to wire additional monies of approximately $21,000 USD to cover notary fees to a third party in the UK named John Anderson and John Williams from the European Financial Consortium, who was using an email address in the name of John Williams, whom John Anderson claimed was his bosss email account at the European Financial Consortium. The wiring instructions that Mr. Anderson provided us was AMX Millenium Services LTD representing a Used Car Company which our due diligence showed to be Registered in the UK, and the recipient of the proposed $21K notary fee to be a company which sold used cars. At this point, the validity of the entire transaction was brought into question and an International Law firm was retained for investigations into all parties in ALL locations. To this date, our team is still attempting to recover our 2.3% Satex Insure Co SRL Surety Bond amount, and are in the process of filing criminal cases against all parties mentioned in this document. Once we requested our Surety Bond fee be returned or legal cases would be brought against the five (5) principals and the two (2) business entities: Greg Christie, Waathiq Ndaw, Quentelle Barton, Martin Laurence, Satex Insure Co SRL, Sandy Rabuazzo, and Siemens SFS, the Satex Insure Co SRL website suspiciously went offline as of March 04, 2019. At this point we believe the European Surety Bond Backed loan platform to be an Organized Crime Ring and Operation, with locations in: Italy, Germany, UK, Asia, and the USA.

I decided to take matters into my own hands and try some r/prorevenge shit, I made another account so I am not blocked and screen recorded my entire conversation this time so that I would have proof. I played it more safe and asked her to send me 'sample' photos and she eventually obliged, these were timestamped (holding her phone up in front of her) and featured the same bedroom used in other photos which I felt confirmed that it isn't a 'guy' using honeypot female photos. Because I could verify with pretty much no doubt that the pictures were in fact her, I cross checked her name on the PayPal account (which was her full name and it even had a profile picture for more validation) and her name matched with the Instagram and the face matched the photos. I felt I had enough information and I contacted the police and put in a complaint to both Instagram and the federal cyber-crime division, I got my money back from PayPal and I feel I have enough info for the police to track her down and bring her to justice.

So I was up north visiting my lil ol' parents yesterday, just catching up with my mom on her porch when her eyes light up and she goes ""OOH! I almost forgot to tell you, the most exciting thing happened the other day!"" She proceeds to tell me that a (typed) letter came in the mail addressed to my dad, saying that they knew ALL about what he's been doing lately and how could he be so horrible and that they were going to ruin his life and tell all of my parent's neighbors and my mom and her friends what he was doing unless they received $15,000 in bitcoin (or some other random type of payment but I can't remember what), and gave him instructions in the letter of how to do it. Now, my mom thought it was hilarious, and my dad wasn't home at the time so I didn't get to ask him about it, but honestly I'm a little worried about this. Maybe I watch too many crime shows but this actually sounds a little scary. Do you think I'm overreacting a bit or that this could lead to something weird? My parents are pretty well off, have a beautiful home, are very very sweet, and I could see them being targeted for something weird and sinister like this. His name was written on the letter and everything. Also, for those of you who are cynical, my dad is like, the most dad-joking old dude ever, he loves golf and bike rides and goes to bed at like 7pm. He works in cyber security, and it's a very very new job, so I'm hoping that doesn't have anything to do with it. I don't know, I'm totally just spitballing any info that I think is relevant or could be. Do you think my parents should be a little concerned about this? Has this ever happened to any of you?

The initiative, unfolding this week ahead of Independence Day travels, has agents inspecting pumps in 21 states. &gt;""The Secret Service is leading the charge to protect the U.S. consumer against this growing cyber-enabled financial crime,"" the agency said Tuesday in a statement, reporting a Memorial Day effort last month that turned up over 70 such skimmers. &gt;Skimmers are small, electronic devices installed secretly at pumps and able to capture a swiped payment card's protected data, the agency said. Commercial keys purchased online let fraudsters access pumps often left unattended, according to a report from ABC News. &gt;To reduce the chance of having credit information being stolen, here are some options. Customers can pay with credit cards inside the gas station, rather than at the pump. &gt;And paying with cash may be the most effective way to thwart card theft at the pump. Ive heard of skimmers before, but I didnt know that you could just buy a key to any gas station pump on the Internet. Isnt that a pretty serious hazard?

The next part is just paraphrasing; I can ask for the origional contact log if needed. They told him the postal code my friend provided was incorrect, and that the package had to be shipped back to the supplier. He was given 2 options from the customer service agent he spoke with over e-mail: 1. Send additional shipping fees to cover for the return and second shipping costs; 2. Recieve a refund, but have the return shipping fees taken out of the refund price. My friend was suspicious of this and checked the shipping address he provided to the website, and it was correct. He replied to the customer service agent saying this and asked the address they had on file when they sent the package. The agent replied, but ignored his request only offering a refund. My friend thinks this sounds suspicious, as do I. If anyone has a similar experience with this website or has any insight, please let me know. He is considering contacting the 'Polizia Postale', a type of cyber-crime police that investigates this kind of thing in Italy, but doesn't want to jump the gun in case this is a legititimate case and the company is entitled to said shipping refunds.

Victims were allegedly sold wine by salespeople who cold-called from an address on Fleet Street. They were promised between eight and 40 per cent profit on investments. Detectives from the fraud team also searched two addresses in Southwark and one in Lewisham. The losses of those targeted are estimated to run into the millions. The investigation began following reports made to Action Fraud, the national fraud and cyber reporting service. So far 39 victims have filed reports, but detectives have contacted many who were not aware they had been victims of fraud. Victims were told the whisky was being kept in storage for them, and were pressed to buy more whisky to make it more attractive to potential buyers. Many of those affected were elderly, the police said today. City of London Police detective inspector Andrew Thompson said: Boiler rooms continue to be a major threat to individuals in this country and statistics show that those who are over 60 are particularly vulnerable to this type of crime."" He added: I would urge anyone who is cold called and offered investment opportunities to put the phone down and always do your research before making financial decisions."" The arrests were made as part of the City of London Police's Operation Broadway, which targets illegal activity based at some of London's most iconic addresses."
20,cyber crime,Scams,Fraud seller advice from a Third Party Seller on Amazon and What is really going on,4,629psy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/629psy/fraud_seller_advice_from_a_third_party_seller_on/,2017-03-30 08:42:17,"As many of you guys have noticed there has been a huge rise in fraud sellers and sellers listing stuff for very cheep. Some of this stuff has even made the newspapers. I am an amazon shopper myself, but also a third party seller from California. I can shed some light on what is going on and how you can protect yourself. In the past several months Amazon has started vetting Foreign sellers. All they needed before was an email address and bank account and would use certain services to get back on Amazon if their accounts every got suspended. Now they require business info, proof of address, copy of government ID and the whole 9 yards. These fraud sellers are not necessarily getting paid out as you have to wait up to 30 days to receive your first payment to make sure you are legit. These fraud sellers are also not all coming from China, but India and middle east. They are using certain servers that show they are in the USA. You may of experienced this in some way where you bought an item from a US seller only for the tracking number to show it is from China. Amazon requires third party sellers to prove a counterfeit item by placing what is called a, ""test buy"". So many of us have placed test buys against our own product only for it to never show up. Several days later we were getting bogus phone calls claiming to be Amazon to verify our information. Bottom line is... Amazon is officially under attack by some sort of cyber organize crime group or country. Some sellers believe it can be an inside job, as amazon outsources all of its customer service. What these scam sellers are doing is Information farming. As a seller when you buy something we get your email, name, and address. This is standard for all platforms, ebay, etsy, and personal websites. Sellers like me have no need to use this information other than ship you the product you bought. Now on some occasions we can also see your phone number. These would be large orders that shipping carriers like Fedex and UPS would require. Now your credit card and bank information is 100% safe with Amazon and we can not see that in anyway! Also Amazon will always take care of you and refund your money! The info that is given out though is enough for a fraud seller to start the processes of inquiring your credit information. A lot of times they will call or email and claim they are from Amazon and they need to verify your credit card, and use the recent order info and address to falsely prove they are Amazon. Since you probably order an item at a killer price! Do not click on any links! If there is a credit issue you will get a pop up or info through the actual website when you sign in. Amazon till recently has been very trusted so a lot of elderly people or people not aware of these scams may fall for it very easily. If your grandma or mom shops on Amazon a lot and is not internet savvy, they may fall victim. Just be aware of these fake phone calls and emails and also double check everything. If it seems too good to be true it probably is. Also please share this with family members that maybe vulnerable to internet scams. Why Amazon has chosen not to clean this up yet is beyond all of us! A lot of rumors going around, but nothing is for sure. They might be allowing it to close in on the group and bring criminal charges. Who knows. Don't give up on Amazon and continue to shop here, just be a little bit more careful while all of this stuff is going on. I personally believe they are working hard to clean it up, it may just take some time."

If you get a call and you hear nothing for more than 5 seconds, it's an autodialer. 80% of the time it's a telemarketer or a scam. 2. If you certain a call is a scam - a marine rescue whistle is your best friend! 3. Regarding e-mails. NEVER use the provided ""unsubscribe"" link. It just confirms that your a real person. Also, most emails from scammers and telemarketers have 2 unsubscribe links. 1 from the sender and 1 from the host. If you click on 'em, you're now going to see a 10 fold increase in crapmail! 4. Set up a couple of e-mail boxes. Keep 1 just for people you know and businesses you trust. Set the other one up for everything else and give that address out. You can at your leisure decide to keep or block the e-mails. 5. Don't be afraid to report scammers! If enough people bitch, someone will take notice. And yes, I get it. Fighting Cyber-Crime is still in it's infancy. So it's more important than ever to report it. "
22,cyber crime,Scams,[FB Sextortion/ Scamming] Advice for current victims,14,5bnm76,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/5bnm76/fb_sextortion_scamming_advice_for_current_victims/,2016-11-08 04:51:54,"My SO's father (1st generation immigrant, tech and English illiterate) accepted a FB request from a mid-late 20's Philippine woman yesterday. They were chatting and flirting, and eventually began webcamming on Skype. As you can imagine where this is heading, one thing led to another and they (I know it is a scammer entity, not a lone woman) were able to record my SO's father diddling himself on webcam, face included. She began to mention tuition, costs, and needed $500 USD or else she'd leak his videos. They were able to figure out who his wife and kids were on FB, along with his close friends. He had his friends and phone number information view able to friends so they captured that as well and used it in their threat. Before they reached me, my SO's sister banned him from friends on FB, but this opened a can of worms as she remembered she needed screen shots of the scammer, so then proceeded to un-ban the scammer. She tried to ban them again but apparently FB has a 48 hour time constraint if you un ban and ban someone immediately. After my SO reached out to me for help, I did a couple of quick google searches on several legal and scamming sites and sub reddits, all basically saying it's futile to track them down or contact authorities. The conclusion seemed to be _never negotiate with them or send money, just ban and move on. Handle damage control on your own._ Upon discovering that we attempted to ban them on FB, they doubled down on their bluff by sending a Youtube link of the uploaded web cam video. With that in mind I decided to raise their _bluff_ with one of my own, I proceeded to type the following message before deactivating my SO's fathers FB: &gt;Blackmail is a serious crime, I have enough information on your account to report to the police and INTERPOL. Whether you post or not, I am reporting your accounts to law authorities. Additionally, I have requested several cyber security specialists to track your account information (Facebook, Skype, etc.) so that we can build a case against you and your black mail threats, and ultimately track you down. Since you have already threatened black mail, INTERPOL Manila does have a system to help us track you down as an offender based on the network traffic I have logged against you. Blackmail and extortion is a serious crime in any country, especially yours, you will be jailed at the very least for this, I hope you enjoy your punishment under Duterte's draconian law system. Enjoy your day. &gt;Section 10 of the Libel Law (Act No. 277) is as follows: Every person who threatens another to publish a libel concerning him, or any parent, husband, wife, or child of such person, or any member of his family, and every person who offers to prevent the publication of any libel upon another person, with intent to extort any money or other valuable consideration from any person, shall be punished by a fine of not exceeding one thousand dollars or by imprisonment for not exceeding six months, or both. The last responses we received before deactivation were: * _goodluck_ * _ur a maniac_ I proceed to kill his account and flag their uploaded video on Youtube for nudity. Turns out they had another victim on that same Youtube account diddling himself. 24 hours later we found out the videos were taken off of Youtube (unsure if it was taken down by Youtube or the scammers took it down), and they had also shut down the scammer's FB account. None of his immediate family have reported the video leaked via FB messenger, so we are just hoping they decided it wasn't worth it and moved on. __TLDR__: SO's father was recorded diddling himself on Skype with female scammer entity, tried to ban them but un-banned to get screenshots of the predator resulting in 48 hour time constraint by FB. Raised their bluff of leaking the video to family and friends by typing out a threat of reaching law authorities, no attack has been reported by scammer yet and their accounts are taken down. So given these sequence of events, I must also advise to never negotiate with scammers, it's a lose-lose situation if you do. Call their bluff, and be ready for damage control if they continue with their threats. "

A few months ago she had a computer problem and got help from some company. Company's name was Blue Bird or Blue Group or some shit. Anyway, they told her they'd give her free service for life and she bought it. She downloaded their ""anti-malware"" program and gave them remote access to help her with computer problems. Fast forward to today. I walk into the living room and see my wife talking to someone on the phone and entering credit card info into the computer. I ask her what she's paying for. She tells me that every so often, her computer will get a virus and this company will call, out of the blue, to fix it. All she has to do is pay them every time they call. Hmm... I tell her to hand me the phone. What follows is the conversation I had with the guy on the other end. Me: What's your name and your company's name? Him: I'm sorry? I've already told all of that to your wife. Me: Uninstall all of your programs from my wife's computer. Him: Are you sure you want to do that? Do you understand what you're telling me to do? Me: Yes, I understand. Uninstall your program from my wife's computer. Him: Do you take responsibility for your wife's computer? Me: Yes, I take responsibility.

Him: No, the FBI doesn't handle crimes over the internet. Me: The fuck they don't, they have an entire cyber crime division. This trails on for awhile, ending with me asking to talk to his supervisor and him telling me he is the supervisor. I tell him I don't give a shit, just uninstall his fucking program. He proceeds to start uninstalling everything. Opening up the control panel, going to uninstall programs, and starting from the top and clicking uninstall. We shut off the computer right then. Here are some phone numbers he's used to call my wife: 866-837-1063 866-522-7749 314-2520 That last one is weird, when she told me the number I asked for the first three digits and she said that's all there was. If any fellow redditors can help us with this, that would be amazing. Even if I get called an idiot because it turns out to be a legit company, that'd be great because then I can call someone and tell them this guy threatened me with legal problems."
