Anyway, we need to trace a deleted facebook account because the account has been sending malicious videos of a friend of mine and is trying to extort money from him. We'd like to know who is responsible so we can take necessary actions. Unfortunately, we went to our cybercrime government department and they said that the money they are trying to extort is too little anyway ($400), just give in to the girl spreading videos... I am from the Philippines. We don't want to give that kind of money for someone who already ruined a life. The girl made a group with his family, friends and CLIENTS, and we are sure most of them saw it. I hope someone can help us here. Thanks!"
1,cybercrime,hacking,The developer of omnirat was just raided by German police,11,c6lo8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/c6lo8e/the_developer_of_omnirat_was_just_raided_by/,2019-06-29 01:39:00,"Article courtesy of the geek app, a great so for all tech news and tutorials on hacking. Only works on Android devices however so if you're on IOS or PC u can't get it. If your on Android however I do encourage downloading it. The German police yesterday raided the house of the developer of OmniRAT and seized his laptop, computer and mobile phones probably as part of an investigation into a recent cyber attack. More Info on : URL Download 'The Geek App Reloaded By Alien Skills' from Google Play. The world's best handbook for Security Experts with 1 Million+ downloads. The German police yesterday raided the house of the developer of OmniRAT and seized his laptop, computer and mobile phones probably as part of an investigation into a recent cyber attack, a source told. OmniRAT made headlines in November 2015 when its developer launched it as a legitimate remote administration tool for IT experts and companies to manage their devices with explicit permissions. Available between $25 and $100, OmniRAT quickly became one of the most popular remote administration tools, allowing users to monitor Android, Windows, Linux, and Mac devices remotely and access every available information on them. However, just like any other remote administration tool like DroidJack, DarkComet, AndroRAT, and njRAT, some customers of OmniRAT also used the tool for illicit purposes, especially because it was available at a far cheaper price than other RATs in the market. In one such event earlier this year, a group of hackers attempted to target several industries by exploiting an old remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2016-7262) in Microsoft Excel that eventually installed OmniRAT on targeted computers. According to a security researcher who reported this incident in January, the attackers used a malformed Excel sheet disguising as a business profile of ""Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC)"" to lure its victims into opening the attachment. Though Kuwait Petroleum Company was not itself targeted by the malware, another anonymous source told that almost two months ago, lawyers representing the oil company started emailing the domain registrar from where the official domain of OmniRAT was registered and demanded them to disclose the identity of the domain owner, citing whois-related GDPR and ICANN rules. The content on the official OmniRAT website has been unavailable since last few days, which has probably been taken down by its developer to prevent its domain registrar from disclosing his identity to the company. The developer of OmniRAT reportedly resides in Germany, but his/her identity is still unknown to the public. At this moment, it's not clear if the raid by German police is linked to the efforts made by Kuwait Oil Company or involves some separate criminal case against him. It's also possible that the German police could be behind the list and identity of all the customers who purchased OmniRAT in the last four years to crack down on cybercriminals abusing the tool. In a similar operation in 2015, law enforcement agencies in several countries raided homes and arrested suspected users of DroidJack smartphone malware. Though creating malware or hacking tool is illegal in Germany, like many other countries, it also depends upon how the tool has been advertised. Because just like penetration testing tools, remote administration tools are also a two-sided sword and can be used for both legal and illegal purposes. In one case, it was reported that two years ago a group of hackers were using OmniRAT to spy on Islamic State (ISIS) members and supporters by distributing its Android version via the popular Telegram messaging app. A disclaimer, as shared below, posted on the official OmniRAT website also said that the tool is not for hacking and that customers are themselves liable for any misuse. ""OmniRAT is created by German authors, and the servers are also located in Germany. Therefore the German law applies for us. OmniRAT is a remote administration tool (rat). It is not  as many believe  a trojan neither made for hacking; therefore, it is not illegal and does not violate the law. The usage, however, is only licit on devices you own or have permission for. This is also stated inside our terms of service. By purchasing and using OmniRAT, you obey the above."" Although the OmniRAT developer did not seem to have directly encouraged his customers to use the tool for spying on someone, late last year, he posted description and new features of his tool on an infamous hacking forum, a website which is famous among newbies for finding hacking tools in the market. On the same hacking forum, in April this year, he announced the shutdown of OmniRAT, saying ""unfortunately due to the pressure of the government and the cybercrime division OmniRAT has to be shut down. This will take immediate effect."" However, since the working of the tool does not directly rely or share collected device data with the OmniRAT server, users who already have access to the remote administration tool can still continue using it for whatever purpose they want."

The world we live in is almost entirely based on money, such that having it will solve just about all your problems. Having money will make you happy, and not having it will make your life miserable.

7,cybercrime,hacking,Should we encourage cybercrime against Russia?,1,8qb2k5,https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/8qb2k5/should_we_encourage_cybercrime_against_russia/,2018-06-12 03:08:36,"So we all know that Russia harbors it's cybercriminals and refuses to extradite or punish them as long as they don't attack other CIS countries. This is why much malware will not execute if it detects the russian language. The government encourages this and takes advantage of it for their own state sponsored hacking. Should we encourage hackers in the US and NATO to do the same to them? After all, there is no extradition policy so it is practically legal to hack them, and morally justified under the golden rule ""Do unto others as they do unto you."" I think there are too many russian cybercriminals targetting the US and too few american cybercriminals targetting russia, so we should be encouraging this activity. I think this is a perfect compromise for whitehat hackers who don't want to break the law, as this is *practically* legal, and it ought to be because that's their policy for us. "

Should we recommend hackers, especially those unemployed, to hack non\-extradition treaty countries for experience and money? They do the same for us, and there isn't really any risk.

This is especially crucial, rather than redundant, in an era in which threats to independent research may increasingly come from within the government (e.g., police and intelligence agencies) itself. 3. And universities  along with inspector general offices, police departments, and other places where people routinely send sensitive information  must set up secure communication channels for people to contact them more safely.
