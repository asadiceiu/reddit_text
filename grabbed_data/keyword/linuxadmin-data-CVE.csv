So I try here. I need some clarification about how centos (rh) releases security update. I explain. I have several centos 7 server and several debian server and I checked about security update and noticed something strange (at least for me). For example: CVE-2018-1312 on debian was fixed in 03/04/2018, on rh in 29/07/2019 and centos 31/07/2019. Report some links: [URL [URL [URL &amp;#x200B; CVE-2019-3862 on debian was fixed on 13/04/2019, on rh in 29/07/2019 and centos 31/07/2019. Report some links: [URL [URL [URL &amp;#x200B; In the first case severity was ""low"" and delay from debian to rh/centos was \~15 months. In the second case severity was ""moderate"" and delay from debian to rh/centos was \~3 months. Why there is so much time for release security fix on rh/centos? Updates are delayed for a specified problem/issue/testing or other? Thanks in advance."

Updates to [Anchore.io](URL include: The updates made to the previous Navigator service include: - Private Repositories: Allowing you to setup private repositories to be scanned by Anchore. - A Graphical Policy Editor: The new graphical policy editor allows you define your own custom policies and map which policies are used with which images. The policy editor supports CVE whitelisting - allowing a curated set of CVEs to be excluded from security vulnerability alerts. - Expanded Notifications: In addition to image update notifications the Anchore Navigator can now alert you by email when CVEs have been added or removed from your image and when the policy status of your image has changed, for example an image that previously passed is now failing policy evaluation. Your feedback would be extremely helpful, so if you have a minute head over to [URL and take a look Thanks!"
5,CVE,linuxadmin,"Mitigating CVE-2017-1000364 (""Stack Clash"") by adjusting the stack guard-page/heap stack gap?",8,6ie8ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/6ie8ac/mitigating_cve20171000364_stack_clash_by/,2017-06-21 00:06:23,"From [Qualy's Security Advisory](URL &gt; Based on our research, we recommend that the affected operating systems: &gt;Increase the size of the stack guard-page to at least 1MB, and allow system administrators to easily modify this value (for example, grsecurity/PaX introduced /proc/sys/vm/heap_stack_gap in 2010). &gt;This first, short-term solution is cheap, but it can be defeated by a very large stack-based buffer. This seems to be reflected in [SUSE's Advisory](URL &gt; Older SUSE Linux Enterprise versions already had variable heap-stack-gap support. On SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP1 and older, SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, it is possible to use a sysctl variable to adjust the heap stack gap. Temporary during run-time : &gt; echo 256 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/heap-stack-gap &gt;Permanently by adding the following line into /etc/sysctl.conf &gt; vm.heap-stack-gap = 256 So my question, specific to my job, is that does CentOS5 have a similar (or the same) setting to tweak? (Or can we use this as leverage to finally upgrade?)"

Neither an admin nor the user on the server. I have now following questions: - Does RHEL automatically deploy these kind of ""Warning"" scripts via Satellite? - Is this a new method used by RHEL to warn people? - Or just hacked? Greetings!"

9,CVE,linuxadmin,Vulnerability Scanners,16,4w577q,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/4w577q/vulnerability_scanners/,2016-08-05 01:55:59,We currently use Retina from BeyondTrust and I am never happy when Security produces a report. For example I had a report listing multiple Kernel Vulnerabilities going back over 2 years but the report shows we have the latest kernel applied which has all of the mentioned CVEs fixed. Another would be NTP. It looks at the version and flags it as high because it is 4.2 and not 5.0 and provides a CVE. You look up the CVE and it shows it doesn't apply to this version of RHEL. I run into the same problems with Ubuntu. So is there a Vulnerability Scanner out there that will produce accurate reports? or am I going to be dealing with this regardless of the software used? Thanks in advance.
