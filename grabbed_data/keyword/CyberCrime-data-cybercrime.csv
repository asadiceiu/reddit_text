However he keeps making new accounts and publicly replying to my posts. He never sends a a single direct message in private just the replys and none of them are bad ether. no threats, no sexual comments nothing to point any bad intention however, I wanted no contact with this person but he keeps making comments. This has been going for close to a month now and I keep blocking every account but that means nothing anymore since he keeps creating more. I already filed reports to the FBI cyber team and local police but what are the chances this will actually get prosecuted? And what cybercrime would this fall into?"

We all like to whinge and complain about nanny states. While I agree I occasionally partake in activities that benefit from the guise of anonymity, I will happily shove a tracking device up my arse if it means the end of the dark web. I've only been reading up on cybercrime for the past week, so I may be a bit ignorant. So can anyone out there explain to me how the fuck we justify the dark web and cryptocurrency, knowing what it facilitates? Please don't say decentralisation. I don't think, ""I'm happy to put up with child sexual abuse so I can buy drugs online"", should be an acceptable argument."

If say that link could be made do you think that the person involved would certainly be convicted, and is this extremely hard to find evidence the reason why most cyber criminals and fraudsters are never caught?."

Small to Medium size business are victimized by hackers every day. One of the biggest misconceptions about Cyber-crime is that it only happens to the largest companies or organization and while hacks and data breaches that affect major corporations do tend to get the most publicity, that doesnt mean that small and medium-sized business arent also at risk. E-commerce is a burgeoning industry it is expected to be worth 6.7 trillion US dollars per the year 2020. And that makes the industry a huge target for hackers and cyber-criminals. And those hackers and cyber-criminals arent just focusing on the big boys, the huge companies at the top. They are targeting everyone. 60% of the small business that falls victim to being cyber-attack go out of business within 6 months. **Here are some additional facts and figures to help underscore the need for web security, regardless of the company size.**  $576 billion cyber crime cost the global economy in 2015  $15 cyber-breach claims recorded in 2015.  The cost of an average data breach in 2015 $3.79 million.  429 million identities were exposed in data breaches in 2015.  The amount cyber-issuance premiums surged in 2015 is 32%.  Average number of identities stolen per data breach in 2015 is 4885. As we have already stated, you simply cannot justify being unprepared for Cyber-crime. It can happen to any company either large or small. And its effects can be devastating. SSL is just a component of a large comprehensive security solution.

Our research topic considers the role in which Artificial Intelligence is affecting the Legal profession. Some of our speculative research questions are as followed: &amp;#x200B; * *With the use of the Internet and technological proficiency growing exponentially, the platform for Cybercrime increases also. How do we presently define Cybercrime and where do we see its direction heading in the future? With increasing calls for a neutral net, how should we regulate these offences while maintaining a free and open internet?* &amp;#x200B; * *New original forms of crime are being facilitated by the Internet; recent cases of SWATTING and DDoS attacks have showcased this. Is the current legal system able to adapt and enforce accurate justice against these new crimes, or should an alternative judiciary be considered?* &amp;#x200B; * *Can you envision a future where an AI system has entirely automated the Legal Profession? Can a machine learning program take on the roll of the Judge, Jury and Executioner ? What happens to the idea of empathy and compassion in this future?* &amp;#x200B; * *It is often claimed that our Judiciary doesnt reflect the diverse society in which it serves. Is there a potential growing disparity between the way in which communication and information is shared over the Internet and the typical demographic which sentences it? Is internet culture completely/accurately understood at the highest level?* If anybody, can offer an insight into any of the above questions, we would greatly appreciate this! We would also be super stoked to have a conversation with somebody with a background in this world too/ &amp;#x200B; B, D &amp; K"

Recently, the NCA (a British watered down version of the FBI) published a report on pathways into cybercrime and found that video game cheating/forums are the ideal stepping stone to a career into cybercrime. I can certainly see the reasoning behind this claim but not fully convinced. Im basically looking to do a qualitative comparative analysis of both groups (video game cheating forums and cybercriminal forums) to disprove (or prove) a correlation between the two groups and how exposure to the video game cheating forums can increase the likelihood of becoming a member of a cybercriminal forum and may indulge in cyber enabled crimes. Anyone here have any suggestions or advice for collecting the data? Or even better, want to become a participant? Any information at this stage would be a massive help. Thanks"

From wikipedia - The elements of false pretenses are: (1) a false representation (2) of a material past or existing fact (3) which the person making the representation knows is false (4) made for the purpose of causing (5) and which does cause (6) the victim to pass title (7) to his property. Now I see how this applies to say using someone's credit card to make a purchase - Could this also be argued to apply to private keys and obtaining data? I imagine a credit card is slightly different because it has identity as part of the card i.e. a name and signature, but an unsigned private key does not. "
