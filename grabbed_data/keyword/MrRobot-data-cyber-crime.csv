0,cyber-crime,MrRobot,Mr. Robot spinoff idea,2,hlx5qq,https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/hlx5qq/mr_robot_spinoff_idea/,2020-07-06 10:02:48,"A cool idea for a spinoff could b about Leon, Darlene, and Dom since it seems that Leon hints at it when dropping Darlene and Dom off at the airport. He talks about how he has some adventures for her when she returns. Then later Dom tells Darlene about a job opportunity working for the cyber division. The show could consist of Darlene working for the fbi cyber crime division and that could open up more content for Domlene which is what I want more of the most. They could also play around with Darlene's relationship with the real Elliot. This would allow us to get to know the real Elliot and possibly have a dynamic where all the personalities work together, but not be the main focus. This opens the possibility of Leon, Darlene, MM Elliot, Mr Robot, and the real Elliot doing whatever ""adventures"" Leon was talking about. This could provide internal conflict with Darlene and Dom since Dom is an fbi agent. I feel like there is more than enough content here to carry out a full series if done right, which i have no doubt that Sam would b able to pull it off."
1,cyber-crime,MrRobot,Privacy laws VS Govt Surveillance,1,eii3f0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/eii3f0/privacy_laws_vs_govt_surveillance/,2020-01-01 23:58:32,"I really like this show as they opened a conversation about it. Yes, it is a difficult conversation but at some point we really have to dive in deep so that we as a society can make an informed choice. One doesn't have to be tech-savvy to undertand this. With surveillance, we are so willingly ready to submit our privacy in the hands of the government in the name of ""national security"" BUT it can be abused heavily and one doesn't have to be a mob member either. (example when Cisco took pics of Angela's nude pics and threatened to leak it online, FBI's surveillance methods which fsociety leaked in season 2) Unfortunately we dont have enough privacy laws to protect victims of revenge porn/ identity theft and other data breach crimes and can be used to humiliate and shame the other person. (Ashley Madison data breach) On the other end of the spectrum, unaccounted privacy can have its drawbacks too. Like increase in crime which makes sense why bitcoin is used by criminals. Child pornography, human/ organ trafficking etc is easily accessible in the dark web and other stuff. I don't know what the solution is. But at least having an open discussion about it can really help so that we can protect our privacy as well as reap in the benefits of the technology we use today. Hopefully with that we can have better more nuanced laws which can protect people who are victims of cyber bullying/ identity theft/ data breach / revenge porn/ doxxing but at the same time serious crimes which is conducted in the dark web can be controlled. This can educate the masses, raise general awareness and put pressure on the law-makers for better more nuanced laws in each and every country."
2,cyber-crime,MrRobot,"Vera, a deep dive (All your questions answered)",1,acvknt,https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/acvknt/vera_a_deep_dive_all_your_questions_answered/,2019-01-06 03:31:06,"Understanding Veras importance to this story starts, oddly enough, with appreciating Elliots impact on two of the shows other characters: Tyrell and Ray. # # Elliot has an unusual effect on people &amp;#x200B; In Tyrells case, Elliot encourages a seemingly mystical conversion. Without explanation, [Tyrell transitions](URL from ambitious corporate-ladder climber to economic terrorist. Along the way he develops a nearly religious devotion to Elliot. Ray undergoes a similar, but less obvious conversion. Just look at what Ray says to Elliot after Elliot destroys his business and sends him to prison: &amp;#x200B; &gt;***Ray***: I thought I was gonna be your savior. . . .You are my answer. Its not the other way around. So thank you. &amp;#x200B; You are my savior. You are my answer. These are statements with glaring religious overtones. And hes addressing this reverence to someone who is in the process of sending him to prison. But that is not the strangest part. Mere days earlier, Ray is having Elliot tortured. Somehow Ray goes from beating Elliot into submission to thanking him and proclaiming him his personal savior. Were never given an adequate explanation for that conversion. Simply looking at the site Ray assumed is marketing terrible things is not enough of a reason to believe a serial torturer (Ray tortured RT as well) happily repented. Ray isnt a good guy notwithstanding his mellow demeanor. Hes a sadistic crime boss. Until one day he wasnt. And the reason Ray gives for his change of heart is Elliot. Ray not only uses religious language to describe his feelings for Elliot, he seems to have had a quasi-religious conversion as well. Just like Tyrell. And Ray is actually the third person in the story to have this kind of conversion around Elliot. # # Like Ray, Vera thanks Elliot for destroying his business &amp;#x200B; Before Ray and even before Tyrell, Vera was the first character to experience the seemingly miraculous way in which Elliot changes people. Veras conversion is more subtle than those of the others because it is hidden behind Veras often indecipherable mysticism. But his reaction to having his criminal enterprise destroyed by Elliot is identical to Rays. Vera thanks him. Ima hug you bro is a statement one can easily mistake as threatening coming from a person like Vera. Until Vera meets Elliot face to face and . . . actually hugs him. In that scene Vera could easily harm Elliot. He has the gun. Elliot is alone. But instead of extracting vengeance directly on Elliot, he hugs and thanks him. And I think we can make sense of Veras behavior because Sam Esmail gives us a clue. This bit of strange dialog from Vera paraphrases a scene in Pulp Fiction that speaks directly to what is happening in Mr. Robot: &amp;#x200B; &gt;***Vera***: Like Cain after Abel, I'll be a fugitive and wander on the earth. A brave fugitive, a brave wanderer. Look how you helped me. . . . &gt; &gt;***Vera***: My operation is over. So go on, crash it, burn it to the ground. Doesn't matter. &amp;#x200B; I think the proper context to understand this Vera comment is the scene in Pulp Fiction where Jules is talking to Vincent about abandoning his criminal lifestyle. &amp;#x200B; &gt;***Vincent***: You're really thinkin' about quittin'. For life? &gt; &gt;***Jules***: Most definitely. Yeah. &gt; &gt;***Vincent***: What you gonna do then? &gt; &gt;***Jules***: Well, that's what I been sitting here contemplating. First I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, basically, I'm just gonna walk the Earth. &gt; &gt;***Vincent***: What you mean, ""walk the Earth""? &gt; &gt;***Jules***: Like Caine in Kung Fu. Walk from place to place, meet people, get in adventures. &gt; &gt;***Vincent***: And how long do you intend to walk the Earth? &gt; &gt;**Jules**: 'Til God puts me where He wants me to be. &amp;#x200B; Vera isn't just saying his current operation is over and that he's going to go elsewhere to be a criminal. He's saying he's done being a criminal  just like Jules, and just like Ray. &amp;#x200B; # Elliot destroys peoples love of money # The show never explains how or why people have this kind of reaction to Elliot. But three different characters clearly do. One thing that may tie them all together is money. Elliot says he doesnt give a shit about money. And at least in the case of Ray and Vera we know these characters are choosing to walk away from their lucrative criminal enterprises. Theyre walking away from, as Ray says, the kind of money that makes you question right and wrong. Tyrell does too, in a manner of speaking. After meeting Elliot he throws away his corporate career. And instead of looking for another executive position at another firm, he dedicates himself to helping Mr. Robot destroy the entire capitalist system. For lack of a better term, Elliot is anti-money. Contact with him causes people to stop caring about money. We see that in Rons coffee shop, too. Ron starts off saying he wont pay ransom but very quickly changes his mind. &amp;#x200B; # Veras back and hes here to help &amp;#x200B; Vera doesnt return to the show as a criminal, but as a disciple of sorts. In Season 1 Elliot freed Vera of his criminal obsessions and now Vera returns to the story in order to help Elliot. But how? I think we learn something about that during their conversation at Shaylas apartment. &amp;#x200B; &gt;***Vera***: You remind me of me when I was younger, depressed and sullen. Matter of fact, tried to kill myself, a couple of times. Never could get that shit right. Biology wasn't my strong suit. &gt; &gt;***Vera***: I hated myself, man. Still do. Thought that shit was a weakness for a long time. Then I realized that shit was my power. People walk around, act like they know what hate means. Nah, no one does, until you hate yourself. I mean truly hate yourself. That's power. &amp;#x200B; Thats a cryptic statement with several possible interpretations. But Vera isnt the only one who thinks Elliots hate is powerful. &amp;#x200B; &gt;***Whiterose***: which is why you misunderstand Mr. Alderson's value. We may possess the necessary tools, but what we do not have is his unadulterated focused rage. &amp;#x200B; One way to interpret Whiteroses machinations in Season 3 is that they were an effort to focus Elliots rage. The cyber bombings were an unnecessary and risky way of achieving the petty aim of slapping Prices wrist. But using them to re-energize Elliots crusade, something Whiterose has manipulated from the start  well  thats just genius. &amp;#x200B; # If Whiterose is weaponizing Elliots rage, Veras mission is to help him control it. &amp;#x200B; The clue to how Vera might help is buried, quite deeply, in another aspect of the show. And the key to uncovering that clue is the understanding that Mr. Robot is, among many other things, a big part of Elliots problem. While its true that Mr. Robot protects Elliot from certain harms, Mr. Robot simultaneously facilitates those harms. We see this happen again and again in a multitude of ways. When Elliot jumps from the pier in what Krista and Shayla assumed to be a suicide attempt, it was Mr. Robot who pushed him. We see Mr. Robots brutal psychological torture of Elliot all through Season 2 and actual physical punishment in Season 3. It was Mr. Robot who provoked Elliot to jump out his bedroom window in 2015 and, presumably, also in 1995. &amp;#x200B; # Mr. Robot is a manifestation of Elliots self-loathing &amp;#x200B; These are all actions of self-harm. Theyre all designed as self-punishment for things Elliot has done and things Elliot has failed to do. They are all examples of the self-hatred Vera talks about. But theres more, and it is directly related to Vera. One thing we learn from Elliots prison journal is that Mr. Robot deliberately sabotages Elliots plans. Heres one such incident where Elliot was trying to protect Carla from a prison punk named Santos: &amp;#x200B; &gt;***Elliot (prison journal)***: HEs a maniac. HE took over and went to Santos, confessed everything. Its fucking hard enough surviving in here. How am I supposed to do it when ~~I keep sabotaging myself~~ HE KEEPS SABOTAGING ME?? &amp;#x200B; # Mr. Robot sabotaged Elliot's plan to help Shayla &amp;#x200B; Many of us have questioned why the photo that allowed Vera to identify Elliot ever got uploaded to the NYPD in the first place. The photo doesnt incriminate Vera in any way. And it doesnt appear to have been uploaded on accident. Quite the contrary. When we see Elliot uploading the file, that photo is prominently displayed on Elliots monitor. Whoever sent it did so on purpose. &amp;#x200B; URL &amp;#x200B; It seems likely that Mr. Robot deliberately sent that photo as a way of sabotaging Elliots attempt to help Shayla. If that is true, then Mr. Robot is responsible for Shaylas death. &amp;#x200B; # [Shayla is the reason Elliot and Mr. Robot are fighting](URL &amp;#x200B; And it also seems likely that getting rid of Shayla was the entire point. As [I explain in greater detail here](URL there is a lot of evidence to suggest that Shayla is the reason why Elliot is fighting with Mr. Robot. Shayla gave Elliot reason to care for someone other than himself. And once that happened, Elliot began to feel compassion for the people who would be hurt by his revolution. And once he started caring about the innocent bystanders, the idea of blowing up buildings and even destroying the worlds economy became increasingly problematic for him. And those are the things over which Elliot and Mr. Robot have been fighting since Season 1. Ever since Elliot deleted Shayla in S1E6 and wiped his system hes been repressing his memories of her. With Veras return, that will no longer be an option. In Season 4 Elliot will have to confront Shyalas death and Mr. Robots complicity in that death. Elliot will finally have to confront the fact that Mr. Robot is a manifestation of his own self-loathing. He is the reason so many of Elliots plans and relationships fail. &amp;#x200B; # The path to integration runs through Veras counsel # And because Season 2 taught us that Elliot cant defeat that part of himself, the only option left is to do what Vera counsels and embrace it. To integrate with it. To accept his self-criticisms as a source of strength to be channeled productively into personal growth rather than as an excuse for self-flagellation. &amp;#x200B;"
3,cyber-crime,MrRobot,[Spoilers S02E10] My first ever tin foil theory on a possible plot thread that I think will lead up to the season 2 finale,6,51u4g0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/51u4g0/spoilers_s02e10_my_first_ever_tin_foil_theory_on/,2016-09-09 08:47:21,This is probably way off but I'm going to give it a shot. Probably already been posted and I missed it. At the end of episode 10 its pretty clear that Cisco dies. The FBI have no evidence on Darlene and I found it strange how the nurse specifically said that Darlene was probably his girlfriend or something. I think this was to set up the fact that the FBI will think that Darlene was just his girlfriend and was not involved. To them she will also have just witnessed her boyfriends murder and been involved in a shootout prompting even more sympathy. Lollipop FBI chick wont buy this. She will comb through Darlene's online presence I'm assuming Darlene wont erase everything because of (1) Trauma and (2) fear that it will make her look suspicious and (3) she posted it so long ago she doesn't remember as the show made a point of showing us that it happened before the events of season 1 and before Darlene had any intentions of hacking evil corp. They showed us how she was substantially different and I think this was to set up that she completely forgot about the her life on social media because that is not who she is anymore. The FBI chick will find the picture/video? not sure Darlene uploaded on Instagram and she will eventually get to know about Elliot and in turn find out about his cyber crime conviction. After her experiences FBI iron lady won't trust the FBI with the investigation and go all rouge with it until she has all the evidence. This will enable Darlene and Elloit to face the danger of being caught but still be able to somehow get out if they outsmart or kill her as they will not have the full force of the FBI raining down on them. I'm predicting that in the last episode we will see FBI lollipop woman connect the dots and this will become a major conflict next season. What do you guys think?
4,cyber-crime,MrRobot,"Mr.Robot is the bug .Elliot's version 1.0 ,Tyrell is version 2.0 the Upgrade. Proof, [Spoilers S2E11]",0,53q30o,https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/53q30o/mrrobot_is_the_bug_elliots_version_10_tyrell_is/,2016-09-21 08:38:54,"Alright this is a Tyrell = Elliot thread but this will have undeniable proof before the episode airs, that Tyrell and Elliot are one in the same . If you don't it all to be spoiled then LEAVE NOW. Undeniably there will be twist ,the twist is expected to be the nature of phase 2 but the true twist is Elliot being the same guy as Tyrell this WHOLE TIME. URL This scene is from se1ep3 D3bug ,now pay close attention to fly and where it is. It's on Elliot's fists , you think yeah its from fall but really who falls onto their knuckles? especially how Elliot fell off.but notably right before the scene that we see Elliot in the hospital it's the scene where Tyrell beats up the homeless man .Why does the camera focus on his fist because fly is on his because its that (bug) and the final part of that clip , is the realization valuation that E-corp was truly responsible for his father's death ,this of course motivates Elliot to rejoin f-society and continue his crusade to take down E-corp,but before he goes back to F-society, there's a flashback with him and his mom at the bus stop,this takes place around the time of his fathers death . Listen to monologue and watch the way his mother treats him ,and then it cuts to the Tyrell's scene with him doing what's to necessary to achieve his goal. Tyrell is the upgraded version of Elliot which his mother's abuse molded. Next clip, URL I've went over all his in a previous thread so I'll try to only summarize. Qwerty talking about being trapped and that Elliot's apartment is all he knows ,this can be talking about the Elliot personality being dormant for so long , note Tyrell also is in this scene holding a key,why is he there? the next part of the hallucination is Dinner with Angela , at another table he sees his younger self and his abusive mother pretty much force feeding him , then he receives his desert and bites into to it revealing the same key Angela mistakes it for a ring and onto the next hallucination This is the most important one Angela and Elliot are in the F-society building , Angela walks over and says ""those people in there, I just told did them what they wanted to hear"" and that Elliot is lying and can't change the world ""it figures , you were only born a month ago"" and then she says ""you're not Elliot"" Re-watch it and focus on Angela's mannerism in this scene , who does it remind of ? It's freaky ,but it's exactly how Joanna would act , also note Joanna has a distinct walk , its with her arms strongly forward you can see in her scenes in latest episodes. Angela is not behaving how Elliot knows her to behave, she seems calm ,cold and calculating and authoritative just like Joanna doubting Tyrell/Elliot capabilities. The Elliot personality only resurfaced a month ago Darlene triggered it to come back .Remeber Angela even stated that he's been acting different , and even said this to Darlene when they were looking for Elliot ,it was since she came back . Elliot was forced to change when was child ,So he created the Tyrell personality to appease his mother and deal with her abuse, URL Claudia Sinclaid Angela tells Elliot she wished she could be like her, her name is even cool , and then Elliot mentions the time they went to the museum . Which in next scene on the train she mentions, asking if Elliot was speaking to SOMEONE ELSE BESIDES MR.ROBOT . This person was Tyrell the personality he created as a child Tyr(ell) (ELL).iot (stole this from someone else) something a kid would right? The fact that Angela even mentioned this is proof enough that there's clearly another personality inhabiting Elliot. This is my guess , Elliot developed the personality and lived using both until he decided to Erase himself , every trace of him online he destroyed , Then he decided to move somewhere else this place is where he met Joanna Sweden?, Denmark? where ever they speak Danish.This new personality ""Tyrell"" is somewhat submissive and will do what ever it takes to please Joanna , Just like with Elliot's mom.But he oddly found himself working for E-corp rising the ranks and becoming an executive .all this time the Elliot personality had been dormant and possibly the Mr.robot personality was active ? perhaps establishing connection to white rose and the dark army but it was always part of the plan being intentional by Tyrell or unintentional . The plan isn't just to take down e-corp . Which brings me to this scene . URL The Tyrell personality is arguing with Mr.Robot personality to be filled in on his intentions , they were ""suppose to be partners"" The dirty little secret is that Elliot had been working for e-corp this whole time , this would ruin his relationship with Angela and Darlene and F-society . this is what caught the concern of Mr.Robot and why he didn't just walk away.It would ruin the plan but it would also ruin Tyrell because the realities will be realized by Elliot who wouldn't be able to handle the revelation and would probably ""shut down"".But lets look at the other option is the dirty secret that he switched the files? no. that isn't concerning enough how would people close to Elliot be affected by this? So who's Elliot close to? Angela ,Darlene ...f-society? Gideon? co-workers? Shayla (R.I.P) No Elliot made it clear he didn't want to get to close to anybody the only person who'd be affected by the revelation of Elliot being involved with the f-society hackers and Terry Colby would be Giddeon and people at all-safe, Angela wouldn't react negatively to this... so that's that. Also why are they talking so vaguely in this is scene it's not anyone is listening to them ,but us... this scene was vague because information is being concealed from the viewer. And then Tyrell goes to inform Joanna that they've been going after the wrong players the whole time , he realizes that he's the Elliot personality as-well and that's why he's so distressed and realizes the plan is greater than he thought.Mr.Robot may be the master mind of it all , you've pushed me to this point. Phase 2 which is going to be something big. If that's not enough proof URL Listen to the dialogue between them, the tension , Who are you? what did you say your name was?I feel like she can hear us..shes fishing something, why does it seem so dangerous for Elliot? We're supposed to think because he murdered her husband,it's just misdirection the truth is Joanna can break the illusion ,the Elliot personality is only subconsciously aware of this that's why he feels the dangerous vibes. Why does Mr.Robot say he feels like Joanna can see him ? Why does he disappear? Why does the Joanna's handler seem so lax with Elliot? why does Elliot zone out everything he says? Why does Joanna still call Elliot Ollie? when The handler clearly knows Elliots name and can obtain it easily ?simple he's Tyrell and she continues to use that name because its what she presumes the name of that personality. Elliot's the one who sent the phone, Elliot is the one who called he sent the gifts and the final gift ""the greatest one "" Is probably something to do with phase 2. URL Now for episode 11 , it's obvious that something isn't right why is Elliot questioning if Tyrell is actually there in the taxi?the cab driver doesn't even acknowledge that there's someone else just begins driving after Tyrell says the address. while Elliot is quiet. It's clear that they want to put doubt in Elliot perspective, what's even Tyrells motivation for all of this?what's Elliots ? revenge ? Angela motivation was revenge too but white rose is showed her his plan , the big picture and Elliot/Tyrell is involved in the big picture.what ever phase 2 is. Now you may ask why Tyrell the most wanted isn't recognized? The same reason Elliot always wears that hoodie it helps conceal his identity , It's also made to parallel with white rose having a 2nd identity . maybe Terrell puts on a toupee and contacts or something. none the less think about it why would Elliot admit his crime of hacking his therapists ex boyfriend and get sent to prison, its because it's all part of the plan Elliot was in prison for about 3 months right after the 5-9 hack wheres the best place to hide? in plain sight. The identity of Elliot Alderson was charged and imprisoned while the Identity of Tyrell Wellick still remains at large. Why was Leon also in prison at the time ? not to just be dues ex machima .Tyrell/Elliot knew nobody in prison will recognize him this was a clever place to hide for 3 months.His early release was also due his previous actions. Why does it seem so perfect? (Iknow it's a tv show) but with Angela finding out that Phase 2 was Elliot's Idea reveals that he's the mastermind of it all. and would have planned it all to go down exactly like this. Why Ollie was the target to bring the infected cd in , why Angela and Ollie were kept alive ,why Darlene is definitely sill alive. note how nobody truly close to Elliot has died yet ,Mobley ,Trenton and Romero were all expendable the only ones were Gideon and Shayla but even their deaths weren't mourned over. and finally I end with the beginning of the show URL URL The show begins with a narration by Elliot and silhouette of Tyrell Wellick in a room with arguing men, pay attention to the room , and the narration and then look at the room Elliot meets Tyrell in later, it's the exact same room. Whats the significant of this i don't know but if you look outside the windows in the first scene they're not fully constructed but in the scene where Elliot's in the room they are the camera focuses on this for a reason ,my guess is to show the purpose of these lawyers were to discuss his plan and everything he needed in place for it to come into fruition , but why does the scene start with Tyrell? Why not with Philip Price or Terry Colby or any other e-corp executive . Why Tyrell and his lawyers? It's because the show is about Tyrell and how he's going to change the world ""Play god with out permission"". now for the next scene where the handler speaks to Elliot ""Sir"" ""Sir"" ""Sir"" he never uses intimidation and he also seems puzzled on his behavior MR.x was given orders from Tyrell in the Tyrell personality saying to make sure he reaches the office at a certain time and to disregard if he acts strangely.Does he really need all those lawyers just to offer a position to someone? this scene is something else , perhaps hes asking the Elliot personality to get on the same page or tried to fill him in. then Mr Sutherland drives him back to his house and gives him their card , then Elliot Immediately hacks Tyrell which was so easy why was it easy why did he know the password ? URL but one thing i want to note is the ""best friends"" email and asking if his medical problem is acting up. I think this is Angela noticing Elliot acting strangely. last video clip URL Why is it so odd that Elliot has a girlfriend? why is Giddeon so surprised and almost awkward even , also why when he's asked by Gideon boyfriend how long they've been together Angela immediately pours herself another drink ,shouldn't she be happy for Elliot? re-watch the first minute of the clip notice how when Giddeon asks ""Can't a boss invite his favorite employees to dinner"" and he points to Angela,Ollie and asian guy.Elliot isn't included! note the way he declines Giddeon's invitation the exact wording and that's none of your business. Also note how Gideon always seems to be on Elliot's case always trying to have a relationship with him, maybe just maybe Elliot is actually Giddeon's boss ,it would make sense why would E-corp not have an on sight representative at the place that is responsible for keeping all their data secure . Why only now are they deciding to take care of cyber-security internally? It's because Tyrell now has a new position he's interim Cto now his position at all-safe would not be needed. If Tyrell can make Elliot a MULTI MILLIONAIRE in 5 years why isn't Tyrell already a multi millionaire , we heard through his conversation with the current Cto he isn't that rich , and Joanna needs his severance package to stay a float. Heres the facts; that meeting was Tyrell debating if he wants to just pursuit the executive ladder but Elliot remains at e-corp because he subconsciously knows the true goal that he wants to achieve which is to take down E-corp and become ""GODS"". I know some of this may be a stretch , especially the logistics of Giddeon and Angela knowing that Elliot and Tyrell are the same person but just keep in mind both identities Tyrell and Elliot exist. Elliot is the first and original identity Tyrell is a fabricated identity that Elliott created when he moved to Sweden.which he had been living as until recently Mr.robot has maybe been with Elliot even while he was Tyrell and Joanna is aware of this . TL;Dr : Elliot's knuckle bruises from when he fell off the pier, Angela and the key In Elliot's withdrawal hallucination,Eliot's job offer .All-Safe being a vendor for E-corps cyber security, Elliot knowing phase 2 and planning it. Elliot being the one to visit steel mountain.And Elliot allowing himself to be imprisoned . All of it works perfectly because Tyrell/Mr.robot planned it to workout that way. (If I'm wrong I'm going to feel Soooo... EMBARRASSED"" "

Someone please make sense of this mess in my mind, if there's any sense to be made at all there. That being said, Mr. Esmail... I've never been more intrigued by a show, more so by a single season of anything, and the fact that I'm cursing you, Esmail, right now at the top of my lungs is the same reason why I'll keep watching this show. Call it what you want but I've never felt so much after hour-blocks of staring at my tv screen. And whether those feelings/emotions are joy, anger, frustration, or confusionit beats the hell out of anything else I can think of. This show makes me feel. I'd rather get lost in the world of 'knocks at the door' than tune into whatever bullshit is on CNN at the moment, or whatever Suit fondled another Suit in Suits... Moreover, what kind of show brings this many emotions together on places like this subreddit? I've equally enjoyed reading the lot of this community's postings as I've watched this season as I have from each episode beforehand... from reassurances that I'm not the only person pulling my hair out, to fascinating theories backed by hours of research, frame freezes, and ""enhance"". I hate this show so much that I love it so much that I hate it. And if I learned anything from that warm feeling I got as a kid when I woke up with no concerns in the world but to have fun and enjoy life... or from that whore ex-girlfriend that broke some of our hearts... or from that first job interview that went terribly, followed by another that worked out, kinda... I've learned that this rollercoaster of fucked up emotions is what makes the difference between being numb and on autopilot through life, or enjoying life. I'd rather hate a tv show (that I love) than be watching Suits, is basically all I'm saying right now. And what I'm feeling right now is just the simple shock that I can waste an hour of my life, that I enjoy very much, on something so terribly fun as this show and truly enjoy it. Just typing to myself at this point, and the 3 or 4 new split personalities that have popped up and are now standing around me watching me type. But seriously, all that being said, if I had a copy of the last episode of the last seasons script on my table right now, I'd turn to the last page, and read the last line, and then wish I hadn't. Why spoil all this mad fun. Thanks."
6,cyber-crime,MrRobot,[Spoilers S2E07] Why Elliot is where he is...,16,4ycd45,https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/4ycd45/spoilers_s2e07_why_elliot_is_where_he_is/,2016-08-18 23:50:48,"My theory is that Elliot is in jail for hacking Michael Hansen, better known as Krista's ex. This is a popular belief already, but there is strong supporting evidence from S1E10 to support it. /u/wwahwah made this post about a month ago: (URL in reaction to the finale, and he was on the right track. &gt; In that conversation with Krista, Hansen said something along the lines of ""I need your help, otherwise without something as crazy as the collapse of the Estonian economy, I'll never get this guy"" (completely paraphrased). When he gets home, he's got the news on, and it's reported that the Estonian economy collapses. Hansen noticed this and seems to have some sort of epiphany. The epiphany Hansen comes to is that he will now have the ability to prove that Elliot hacked him, which would be enough to have him arrested. This theory plays, in my mind, for two reasons, the first being that even with the Dark Army's omnipotent aura, they most likely would not have been able to pull strings to have Elliot released for murder or 5/9 so quickly. However, they would be able to have a small time cyber-crime offender released. Furthermore, whoever Ray is (prison guard? warden? super well connected inmate?), he picked Elliot to help him because word got out that Elliot was arrested for hacking. If he was in for the murder of Tyrell, Ray would have no reason to seek Elliot's help, and if he was in for the 5/9 hack you would probably believe that he would be placed in a more intense and well guarded prison. There are still many unanswered questions regarding the reality of the events that transpired this season, but Elliot himself said that everything did truly happen, they just happened in prison. With that being the case, the best explanation for why Elliot is in jail is that Hansen was able to use the evidence he gathered from Estonia's economy collapsing to prove that he was hacked and had his dog stolen by Elliot.

7,cyber-crime,MrRobot,[Spoilers S2E7] My theory on Elliot's current location and how he got there,111,4yijcj,https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/4yijcj/spoilers_s2e7_my_theory_on_elliots_current/,2016-08-19 22:07:08,"So my theory for why Elliot is in jail, is he confessed to the hacking of the prison in s01e06 and below are the reasons I see to support this theory. 1) The knock at the end of season 1 was the cops coming to ask Elliot about Shaylas death. This seems like a standard procedure thing to do by the police, which is to questions the neighbors of the deceased (or at least every Law &amp; Order that is standard procedure). 2) Shutting down entire prison and allowing prisoners to escape would warrant a decent amount prison time and placement in a rough place which Elliot seems to be. To me, that type of crime would get you put into jail for a fair amount of time, but could be fixed by white rose to manipulate some evidence and get his release without much fuss. Whereas if he was locked up for murder, I dont see how he could be set free already, not to mention there is no way the legal system would move that fast on a murder convection. Next, being in jail for taking the dog seems too weak to be in that type of prison. I would think a slap on the wrist like community service would be more appropriate for that type of crime. Finally, even if he was convicted of cyber hacking Kristas ex-boyfriend I dont see him getting locked up with murderers, I would think that would only get you placed in a minimum security prison. 3) Darlene said in s02e04 I'll never understand why you did this would fit if Elliot openly confessed and told the police when they came to his door that he was involved with Shaylas death and the hack of the prison. 4) He could have confessed to the cops about the hack of the prison which done under duress and that he was forced to do it by Fernando, and that Fernando killed Shayla. This fits with Elliots moral compass of making sure bad guys get what is coming to them. 5) It also fits with the Ray situation in that wether Ray is a warden or councilor (that is irrelevant in my opinion) he was in a position of power in the prison and thus would know Elliot is in for hacking a jail and shutting it down. Ray saw an opportunity with a new inmate with the skills he needed to get his site running again. Those are just my stray observations. Love this show!"

God Damn. That is why he is most likely in prison right now. Any other theories?"

Well I'm rewatching the last episode of the first season, and that same guy said he called the cops on him. And that the cyber crime division has been looking for him for a long time, that's also why at the end of last season, when elliot gets that knock at the door, we never see who was at the door. It was the cops coming in to arrest him. I'll bet you anything"
10,cyber-crime,MrRobot,[Spoilers S2E7] Theory for why Elliot is where he is,35,4yw9nt,https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/4yw9nt/spoilers_s2e7_theory_for_why_elliot_is_where_he_is/,2016-08-22 04:24:13,"*Posted earlier, but changed title to remove spoiler* Dog theft/cyber crime or Vera jail break seem to be the prevailing theories so far as to how Elliot ended in jail. Heres an alternative.. When Elliot was admitted to the hospital, he did not tell the staff that he was pushed by Mr. Robot.(who we thought was responsible at the time). Elliot told the police and staff that he was jumped by a bunch of kids. A police report was probably filed and who knows, maybe even some of those skater kids get in trouble for it. Flash forward to Elliot going back to Tyrells SVU and somehow figuring out that theres a secret usb drive in the sunglasses(how did he know?? but anyway). He goes to the computer cafe and inserts the usb drive containing the Boardwalk fail video showing Elliot falling and Mr. Robot no where to be seen. Elliot has one of his moments. He asks to use the phone and calls 911 wanting to make a confession. What if he was confessing to filing of a false police report. In NY, a person filing a false police can be charged with a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in prison and in some case felony charges if person has prior convictions for filing false reports. In Elliots case, a trivial false report like this might land him 30 to 60 days in jail.. Enough to lay low for a while Turning yourself in for filing a false police report is pretty dumb and goes a long way in explaining why Darlene doesnt understand why Elliot would do something like that.

11,cyber-crime,MrRobot,[Spoilers S1E1] Quick question about Colby,20,49r2l4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/49r2l4/spoilers_s1e1_quick_question_about_colby/,2016-03-10 11:34:25,"Hey guys! Just finished season 1. I loved it. Just had a quick question, and I apologize if this has been asked already. I scoured the forum and episode discussions and couldn't find an answer. So Elliot plants an IP address in the server to incriminate Colby as the source of the attack. But I thought there were court cases recently that ruled an IP address could NOT implicate someone in a crime. Like this article: URL Is this sort of cyber crime different, though, as compared to say movie piracy? Would the courts have a firm case against Colby even if Angela didn't testify? I just didn't think an IP address could be used as evidence. Thanks!"
12,cyber-crime,MrRobot,[Possible Spoilers] Theory on Elliot's Therapy with Krista,45,3l05o2,https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/3l05o2/possible_spoilers_theory_on_elliots_therapy_with/,2015-09-15 14:37:27,"In the pilot, Elliot states he was forced into his therapy sessions with Krista. This isn't ever explained, but I have a theory. My first reaction is the therapy is court mandated, but that means Elliot committed a crime and was later proven guilty. The USA website gives a [spoiler](/that Elliot was arrested for financial hacking), but what if it's something more? Elliot underwent self reprogramming to make E Corp into Evil Corp. If he already hates Evil Corp because of what it did to his father, why would he need to self reprogram? He wouldn't, so what if the reprogramming wasn't by him? What if Elliot was brainwashed and put undercover into the world of hacking? A human honeypot. In Mr Robot, the Dark Army is a group of Chinese hackers. In real life, the Blue Army is a group of hackers run by the Chinese military. I don't know the exact significance of this, but from the Edward Snowden revelations, we know the U.S. intelligence community is closely affiliated with Fortune 500 companies via economic espionage. Would it be crazy to believe E Corp has some sort of affiliation here? It helps explain the 'Men In Black' appearance and the pilot even mentions US Cyber Command (headquartered at Ft. Meade, also home to the NSA). Bringing this full circle, I think Krista's role is to ensure Elliot doesn't figured out he's been programmed...like a robot."
