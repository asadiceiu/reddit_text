I searched a courier company on Justdial. There they had this number displayed ""9564597290""( Note they have created fake listing on Just Dial for many small business which makes users call them directly. This i got to know later after some research) So when I called on this number the guy acted as if he was from the courier company but it felt fishy when he told me these things. (He also has another number +918967879261) 1. He said due to corona Lockdown we will pick up the parcel from your home, but to do that you have to pay us a booking amount of 2 Rs.(Here I know that the office where I am calling is in an area where our civic bodies have allowed shops to be open. More over no courier company asks for 2 Rs booking amount that too for collection from home which I know this company doesn't) 2. I asked him which office he is calling from. He said near railway station. (Now anyone whom you ask would first mention the area name like ""Naranpura"" or ,""MG Road"" for example.) So I asked him which railway station? He said, there is only railway station in Ahmedabad. I replied, there are 2 and gave the name of both the stations. He picked the last one (which is a natural human tendency when you don't know about the options. To make myself sure I quickly searched for the courier near the railway station he mentioned and I found none) 3. I went further asked him to give his paytm number to deposit the amount. To which he said ""aisa nahi hota sirji, aap pehle yeh batao aapke paas UPI hai ki nahi"" I said yes. He asked me ""which bank?"" I said ""aapko kya lena dena? Aap apna UPI ID do. Main deposit karvata hoon"" He said ""aisa nahi pehle booking karna padega"" and send me a code similar to the one shared by the author here starting with ""abupi"" and asked me to forward the same on 9223011112 Now I was sure they are trying to take money from UPI linked to mobile number. So I didn't forward it and faked myself saying I forwarded. He said ""sir aapko sms forward karna hai"" and gave me the instructions for the same too. I said I did it again. He said ""Sir aap kar hi nahi rahe ho"" and he cut the call. He called me again after couple of mins with same process and I again didn't forward. Towards the end he disconnected the call in anger &amp; I cud also here some cuss words in the background from someone else. Now reporting to cybercrime.

The Cybercrime Law, RA 10175, which was the basis for Maria Ressa's conviction, was passed and signed into law in September 2012, by then Pres. BS Aquino III. Justice is served to those media who published fake news. It's not a FAILURE OF JUSTICE AND DEMOCRACY! JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED TO THE FILIPINOS!

More refutations below. -------------------------------------------------------- ### Restriction Of Privacy And Innovation Meaningless tech mumbo-jumbo. ### Roadblocks For Blockchain Data Storage cf supra ### Opt-In Fatigue Maybe true for most people most of the time. However, the rules are now public, and even if only a few lawyers, activists or journalists actually read them in full, it helps to educate the general public. ### Poor Customer Service Unsubstanciated ### Small Businesses Getting Hurt Irrelevant. GDPR is clearly targeted at big-tech with the stature and means to collect and process ""big data"". ### The Slow Death Of Free Services This one may be of some relevance but should really expand on what exactly is meant by ""free"". Corporations targeted by GDPR do not provide for a *free* internet. Not like in free beer, not like in free speech, but rather like in the proverbial and non-existant free lunch. In the end, those enormous corporations make enormous profits by taking money from their users. And its not only about money changing hands. Thirty years ago, this massive and pervasive profiling of all citizens would have been the hallmark of totalitarian regimes. With mounting evidences of elections being disrupted, the cost of ""free"" services becomes unbearable. The currently prevalent business model that stakes everything on advertising isn't durable, and we the citizen-consumers certainly have the right to know what and how much we are paying for. ### Talk About Similar Regulation In The U.S. Well, if it works in Europe, maybe it can work in America ? ### Photography Being Part Of GDPR If you're going to broadcast my image, yes, you need my conscent. And yes, I demand to know what informations you have on me, and what you intend to do with it. GDPR only transposes to the internet rules that have been standing for long regarding all other media. ### C-Suite Becoming Responsible For Data Security Yes, that's the idea. ### Restricted Technology Access For EU Citizens Indeed, limits exposure of EU citizens to ill-designed and leaky technologies and prevents big tech from exploiting the limitations of small-time shops. ### Reduced Ability To Track Cybercrime Unsubstanciated ### More Meaningful Customer Engagement Yes, that's the *intended* idea ### Country Legislation At Odds With GDPR Conflates vastly different questions. Yes, some professional transactions are required to leave an audit trail. Everyday life of ordinary citizens do not. This is not even country specific. ### U.S. Websites Denying Access To EU Visitors Yes. Many products sold in the US could not be legally sold in the EU. European laws are generally more protective of the consumer. ### Increased Value Of First-Party Data Yes. I expect you to use the information I provide to be useful for the execution of the contract we made, and yes, I require that it be limited to that contract. This what GDPR *intends*, precisely.

No, they don't. At least not for the DNC hacks which are the only ones I've thuroughly anaysed. As I explained at length in another post there are only a few types of evidence for this cybercrime that could possibly exist in the universe. Again, this is all **possible** evidence, all the evidence that **might** exist: *1 Forensic evidence of the attack. We have this in the form of the Crowdstrike reports. They do not prove the Russian government was behind the attacks. Again, they were unsophisticated, one teenager was capable of executing the attacks. *2 Information provided by moles within Russian agencies The CIA, **and only the CIA**, claims they have information from one or more moles. The identity of that source and the exact information provided **has not left the CIA**. FBI, Congress, etc. **do not have that information**. All Congress has is ""CIA has sources confirming the attack was by Russian government agents"". That's it. *3 A confession by the attackers, who are confirmed to be Russian agents. We do not have this. If we did it would have leaked. We are very unlikely to get this. We've got the Crowdstrike reports and a totally anonymous Russian source that the CIA thinks is credible. That's it. That's all we **could** possibly have. And that's all we're ever going to get because if the CIA really does have a high-level mole in Russian intelligence there is no way they're burning that source. Remember all the WMD leaks? The CIA leaks like a sieve. If they had **ANYTHING** you can bet it would be in the press. All the usual intelligence reporters, including the ones I trust most like Sy Hersh, haven't heard shit. By the way, [Sy Hersh says Russiagate is bullshit]^^1 . At this point, we (and Congress and everyone else) are taking the CIA's **word for it** that Russia was behind the attacks. EDIT: Technically there is a 4th source: Documentation. Documents planning and executing the attacks, a paper trail of purchases, etc. But that's so easy to fake (see Russian Dossier) I didn't consider that to really count as ""evidence"". So it's possible that CIA (again, only CIA) has some documents too.

The Missouri company, Max 2000 Inc. that had manufactured Pest Control Report 2000, agreed to cease selling the agricultural firecrackers in January 2003 after selling more than one million of them. The company had been selling the product illegally to fireworks wholesalers and retailers from early 1998. Pest Control Report 2000 had been used nationally to control infestations of birds. The explosives were banned because they could cause serious injuries or death. [link]^^2 [link]^^3 **""Bitcoin Cash has performed better than Bitcoin core over the past month, 3 months, and 6 months.""** **""The CEO of block stream is a member of the Bilderberg Group""** ""Bitcoin cash is capable of scaling on chain and taking on the entire world right now with fast, cheap, and reliable transactions for everyone.""

By utilizing the path of least resistance and preying on the vulnerabilities of the uninitiated they have taken to the easiest platform to exploit  social media. Facebook is already an out of control web of digital detritus, clickbait, spam, and fake news. Now its instant Messenger service has fallen victim to an exploit which allows attackers to secretly mine cryptocurrency by harnessing the computing power of those infected. Researcher and cyber security firm Trend Micro discovered the malware which consists of a mining bot called Digmine. It is spread via a fake video that appears to have been sent from someone in the victims friends list. Once opened the video installs malicious code which will compromise the desktop version of Facebook Messenger when used with Google Chrome. Hackers then have a backdoor into the users Facebook account where they can access the contacts list to further spread the malware. Researchers at Trend Micro stated: If the users Facebook account is set to log in automatically, Digmine will manipulate Facebook Messenger in order to send a link to the file to the accounts friends. The abuse of Facebook is limited to propagation for now, but it wouldnt be implausible for attackers to hijack the Facebook account itself down the line. It currently does not affect mobile versions of Messenger as its primary target is desktops with CPU power that can be used to mine Monero, an anonymous crypto cousin of Bitcoin. The profits from this illicit computer-jacking are sent to the attackers encrypted Monero wallet. The software is a modified version of open source mining program XMRig which the bot sets to start automatically. This will fire up Google Chrome with an infected extension that allows the hackers to access Facebook profiles. According to the Trend Micro team: The extension will read its own configuration from the Command and Control server. It can instruct the extension to either proceed with logging in to Facebook or open a fake page that will play a video. The decoy website that plays the video also serves as part of their C&amp;C structure. This site pretends to be a video streaming site but also holds a lot of the configurations for the malwares components. Officially Chrome extensions can only be downloaded from their web store but in this case the malignant code is added via the command line. This is not the first or last time mining malware has been used to exploit systems, back in October a malicious program called Coinhive was embedded into a number of compromised apps on Google Play. A new trend in crypto malware is emerging so extra caution is needed for heavy users of social media.

I figured I would document some events that have taken place for historical purposes so people can be aware of what was writing on the wall. **BTC-e was hacked in 2014** People don't seem to be aware of the fact that btc-e was hacked in 2014 and the database is floating around in certain places. I personally possess the database and can confirm that it is legitimate. The only version that I have seen floating around includes two files, one that includes 198k Usernames, emails, and hashed passwords (hashed with a weird form of bcrypt). There is also a file with USD, BTC, and LTC balances of 568k users. The first file with emails+hashes is seemingly incomplete because there are many emails in the balance file not in the email+hash file. Interestingly enough, there is a file of cracked hashes floating around that has 168k lines, many of which do not show up in the first file but do show up in the balance file, so there must be a full version of the email+hash list floating around. As far as I know btc-e has never confirmed this hack but did force password resets in **September 2016**, after the data went public from 2014. This means they went two years while hundreds of thousands of accounts were vulnerable and btc-e did not alert their users. **Btc-e was exploited using an xss exploit in April 2013** Back in 2013 i remember getting a private message from someone linking to a picture of a bitcoin chart. The page silently exploited an xss exploit that withdrew all their funds (if they had no email confirmed on the account. Btc-e mandated email confirmation for withdrawals after this incident). I actually copied the exploit code and just found it if anyones interested at looking at it. [link]^^1 It seems they got away with 61 bitcoin. Haven't seen anyone mention this so i thought it was interesting. **BTC suspended many accounts and demanded full kyc verification to unlock** This is particularly interesting because btc-e is *the* exchange to go to to launder funds. This has always been the case even prior to the recent news. So why the fuck would they start requiring identity verification? It was simply to close accounts and take their funds. Their US support is laughable to say the least and I believe at one point there was no english support working at all. **BTC-e *might* have links to cybercrime** I apologize for not having enough information on this because i lost my full notes, but i remember doing some research into the btc-e.com domain whois history and somehow connecting this email according to one of the notes i found. golinvest@gmail.com. when you google this you can see that it is connected to malware domains. I really can't remember what connected this to btc-e so feel free to ignore this but i figured i'd give some fellow researches a possible lead. Overall, I would be surprised if btc-e is solvent. They have obvious connections to bad things and most likely the russian mafia, so fair dealing is not really a requirement when no one knows who you are. They simply need to keep enough funds to fulfill withdrawals for a while and they can keep collecting trading fees, which amount to millions every month. I have a feeling we might not see btc-e come back from it's recent down time so it might be a good idea to write those funds off on your losses. Just thought i'd share some interesting history, i love this stuff. Feel free to add your own contributions to this list.

Alle paar Monate gibt es im Bltterwald hnliche berschriften wie im Titel, weil eine der Oppositionsparteien mal wieder eine kleine Anfrage in die Richtung gestellt hat. Leider wird immer vergessen zu erklren, warum das so ist. Grundstzlich gibt es mehr Arbeit als es Polizisten gibt; bei der Polizei gibt es keine Horde von Beamten, die Karten spielend darauf warten, dass endlich etwas passiert. Welche Arbeit in welcher Reihenfolge angegangen wird, wird letztendlich von der Politik bestimmt (kleiner Exkurs: immer, wenn X Stellen zur Bekmpfung von Kinderpornos/Cybercrime/Einbrchen versprochen werden, msst ihr euch X Stellen weniger in anderen Bereichen dazudenken). Die Politik gibt auch die Vorgaben, wie viel Energie bei der Verfolgung von Delikten eingesetzt wird (ein Mord wird mit mehr Energie verfolgt als ein Fahrraddiebstahl). Jedem Polizeirevier ist ein Gebiet zugeordnet. Haftbefehle gegen Personen, die in diesem Gebiet gemeldet sind, werden an das Revier bermittelt (frher per Post und Fax, heute theoretisch elektronisch). Die Haftbefehle werden auch nach Prioritt der Tat abgearbeitet. In dem Revier rennt jetzt aber nicht das SEK los und rammt nacheinander zehn Haustren auf. Haftbefehle umzusetzen ist eine berraschend niedrig priorisierte Aufgabe; das wird immer mal wieder gemacht, wenn gerade nichts wichtigeres anliegt. Auch die Haftbefehle werden nach Prioritt abgearbeitet; Mord und Krperverletzung ist wichtiger als Eigentumsdelikte sind wichtiger als Propagandadelikte. Auch das ist ein Grund, warum Nazi-Ronnie lnger rumluft als Schwarzer-Block-Stefan: Hitlergru wird weniger verfolgt als ein geworfener Stein. Ein Haftbefehl ist kein Freifahrtsschein fr die Polizei; er erlaubt noch nicht einmal die Durchsuchung der Wohnung. Was also passiert ist, dass zwei Beamte freundlich an der gemeldeten Adresse klingeln und fragen, ob $Gesuchter zu Hause ist. Ist die Antwort Nein und nicht offensichtlich von $Gesuchter mit verstellter Stimme gegeben (das wre Gefahr im Verzug), fahren die Beamten weiter zum nchsten Einsatz. Die Polizei ist natrlich nicht doof; die kommen in unregelmigen Abstnden zu unterschiedlichen Zeiten vorbei und fragen auch die Nachbarn, ob $Gesuchter in letzter Zeit gesehen wurde. Die Polizei schaut auch (so vorhanden) bei der Arbeitstelle vorbei; Kollegen verstecken einen seltener als die Freundin. Aber all das kostet Zeit, die die Polizei nicht hat. Es gibt zu jedem beliebigen Zeitpunkt tausende nicht vollstreckte Haftbefehle. Das ist kein Zeichen von Polizeiversagen, sondern eine logische Konsequenz aus dem vorhandenen Budget und den von der Politik gesetzten Prioritten.
