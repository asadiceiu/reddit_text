0,CVE,SCCM,Help w/ OneDrive Removal PS1 Script via Application Package -- Suggestions?,1,i4l16z,https://www.reddit.com/r/SCCM/comments/i4l16z/help_w_onedrive_removal_ps1_script_via/,2020-08-06 14:21:51,"I'm dealing with removing old OneDrive folders/files scattered across various %LOCALAPPDATA% user profiles among our 500+ Windows 10 systems. This is to remediate ""Microsoft OneDrive Elevation of Privilege (CVE-2020-1465)"", while our org has no need to have OneDrive. Therefore, I've come across the following PS1 scripts &lt;[URL and &lt;[URL that appear to hit all the same pieces to fully scrub OneDrive. I've also been comparing against this batch file &lt;[URL Ultimately, after some tweaks to the final version of the PS1 script; I've been able to eliminate all traces of OneDrive--including all user profiles on my test systems--which has cleared the Nessus Plugin ID 138602 from my remediation scans. Now, I've gone ahead and built out an application package to test in Software Center. The detection method looks to be working, identifying systems that have \*OneDrive\* somewhere on the C: drive. For testing purposes, I've left the application visible and it runs without issue until it reaches the step to start the Explorer process after cleaning. I've even put 'sleep' into the script to try and give the system enough time to load Explorer, etc. Unfortunately, the app package ultimately comes back as ""Removal Failed"" in Software Center--despite being able to confirm all OneDrive files/folders have been scrubbed. I'm forced to start Explorer via Task Manager; however, if I run the script outside of Software Center, everything completes successfully, including reloading Explorer. Looking for some help on what I might be missing or if anyone else has been successful in deploying either the PS1 script or batch file in their environment--and if so, how'd you build it out? I'm starting to lean more and more to going w/ a GPO startup/logon script given the whole work from home situation we're all dealing with. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated! Many thanks to those folks who built out the resources, too."
1,CVE,SCCM,Patching OneDrive with SCCM,1,idbqzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SCCM/comments/idbqzx/patching_onedrive_with_sccm/,2020-08-21 00:54:28,"In our environment we have mostly Windows Server but some Windows 10. All of our Windows 10 machines have similar versions of Onedrive 17.x, 18.x, 19.x. which are all out of date. Tenable Security Center recently labeled all below version 20 as vulnerable to a elevation of privilege attack (CVE-2020-1465). I'm a little confused why SCCM is not patching this. I don't specifically see Onedrive listed in SCCM so I would assume it would be part of windows monthly updates which it's not. We also use PatchMyPC with SCCM. This has Onedrive as an option but it also does't seem to update OneDrive. OneDrive is extra frustrating because it seems to install on everyone's local profile once they login. So on top of uninstalling OneDrive we have to delete it from AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Onedrive. If I can get it patched them I won't need to uninstall it so that would be the preferred route. Any assistance would be appreciated. Thanks!"

I'm trying to wrap my head around SCCM and why it's not pushing out updates. I've asked my sysadmins here and they say it's because Microsoft's determined it's not needed. (?) I don't fully trust them and wanted to get some ideas here. Here's the background. We still have several Server 2008 r2 sp1 x64 boxes. According to the web site [here](URL it is telling us to apply [KB4534310](URL for Server 2008r2 sp1. In that KB article, there's a csv file you can download that shows the version of crypt32.dll at 6.1.7601.24542. Now on our server 2008 boxes, a vulnerability scan shows 6.1.7601.24499 on that crypt32.dll file. Obviously, the KB4534310 patches this file as the version increases. When talking to the sysadmin, he is saying that if you run the update on the server from the catalog, it says the update isn't required and exits. He also says that only the Microsoft engineers can explain why it's not required because of the logic in the patch. My question is if KB4534310 applies to Server 2008r2 sp1, and that cve-2020-0601 article says to apply KB4534310, why does our SCCM install say it's not required, while we are running 2008r2 and a vulnerability scan is showing an old crypt32.dll file version?"

27,CVE,SCCM,"Defender 'Turned Off By GPO', Are we at risk for CVE-2017-11927?",3,7iiy3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/SCCM/comments/7iiy3k/defender_turned_off_by_gpo_are_we_at_risk_for/,2017-12-09 10:33:06,"We don't use SCEP or [Windows] Defender and although it's turned off by GPO, it's still running thus loaded in memory (which is something I need to investigate further) That said: Are we at risk? &amp;nbsp; I'm just trying to determine if we need to act even though it's 'turned off'. If we do, I'm guessing: * create a new ADR (or update our existing one) for Defender for just this one issue, OR * download the fix manually &amp; deploy (where to download from because [this didn't update the engine version](URL AND * verify compliance (e.g.: query EngineVersion in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Signature Updates) TIA"
28,CVE,SCCM,DotNet 3.5 Patching Issues Win10,3,7bilme,https://www.reddit.com/r/SCCM/comments/7bilme/dotnet_35_patching_issues_win10/,2017-11-08 14:18:44,"Hey all, So a few days ago I received a report from showing that a few hundred 1607-1703 clients are not fully patching properly(Specifically .net 3.5 dlls). I check few test machines sure enough the Versions of the DLL's are not correct. At that point I downloaded the cumulative patches from the catalog and attempt to reinstall them. They say they are installed already. I move the machines into a GPO that allows windows updates from Microsoft and check for updates. The machines download the 3.5 on demand update then reinstall the cumulative and all the DLLs are to the correct version. I cannot figure out why this happens and what I'm not doing correctly. Environment details: * Updates managed by ConfigMgr * On demand products class added into SUP * Content Filtering Proxy blocks installation of Features On Demand normally * .net 3.5 is currently installed using dism from VLSC Features on demand media. * C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\system.runtime.remoting.dll Should be : 2.0.50727.8771 CVE-2017-8759 Things I tried: * Removing/enabling the NetFx3 feature and retrying the Octobers update * Verifying the NetFx3 cab was the same as available from WSUS/VLSC/WIM * Installing using traditional windows updates(which seems to work) * Removing/enabling the NetFx3 feature and enabling ""Specify settings for optional component installation and component repair"" to Contact Windows updates for repair.( This works also but requires us to remove our proxy/Content Filter). Anyone else encounter this before? **EDIT:** I pulled the updated version of Microsoft-Windows-NetFx3-OnDemand-Package.cab from Windows updates Cache. Then Used [PSADT](URL to update it. DISM.EXE /Online /Add-Package /PackagePath:""\\Example\ExampleShare\Microsoft-Windows-NetFx3-OnDemand-Package.cab"" The next Software updates Scan cycle will catch the cumulative is not up to date and reinstall.
