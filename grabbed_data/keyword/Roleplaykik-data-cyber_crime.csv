I WILL KNOW IF YOU DON'T, AND WILL NOT RP WITH YOU I will insta-block if you break any of these rules: DO NOT SEND ME DICK PICS DO NOT ASK FOR PICTURES OF ME (For proof of my gender or otherwise) I ALREADY HAVE A MASTER. Im not looking for another one. Dont try to claim me or treat me like your slave. Do not try to dominate me, only my characters DO NOT CONTROL MY CHARACTERS. Manhandling them is one thing. Acting like theyre your character too is not. You dont get to decide what they say or think. DO NOT MESSAGE ME WITH AN OPENING POST. I want to discuss the roleplay before we jump into it Major bonus points if you're willing to include fantasy/supernatural/superhuman elements Kinda mildly curious about diaper play, down for it if you want. Otherwise dont worry about it. What I consider a roleplay: A story written by two people taking turns filling out the action and what happens in the story. There's sex involved, but the story doesn't exist to move the scene to the next round of sex. The sex compliments the story, not the other way around * I like a more long term style, where we can reply when we have time rather than the fast paced only roleplay when we're both available kind. * I only play third person, and expect you to follow basic roleplay standards: don't kill my character, don't control my character, avoid excessive one liners, etc * I want to play a character. Nothing to do with me. I will not send pictures. My characters, past the kinks, are not based on me. I'm perfectly happy with the dom I have, I'm not looking for an irl or online dom. * Semi-lit at least, please. Be able to at least make a paragraph on a regular basis * Very few limits. I'm willing to cater to specific kinks but be clear which ones. I don't want to guess what I'm catering to. No limits on the graphicness/tabboo-ness of the sex, gore, violence. I thrive on the violent depravity of others * A list of my kinks and will be sent when you message me. * My subs are usually extremely masochistic * I prefer there to be more than just smut, but smut is a definite focus. So less cyber, more story. This means preferably more than a few sentences each post. I'd also prefer to play characters, not ourselves. That's a bit too cyber-y for me  My idea: Classic lady and the tramp. My character is the obscenely rich trust fund girl. Shes sweet and well-meaning but completely out of touch with how the world really works and sheltered from any of the typical rich girl experiences like spring break parties and drug addiction. Your character lives on the other side of the tracks. Struggling to make ends meet, maybe resorting to crime to survive/support their family. My character gets more in allowance than they make in a year. In theory, our characters should never have met unless yours was serving mine in some aspect. But they end up crossing paths and your character decides to show this sheltered rich girl how the rest of the world really lives. Possible scenarios (feel free to offer your own): * Rich college girl at a prestigious college needs tutoring from the scholarship student * My girl ends up roommates with yours at college * Girl goes into a bad neighborhood to get information for an anthropology course and runs into yours * Your character is the new landscaper/pool cleaner/cleaning staff and mine is your emoloyers daughter * My characters car breaks down and she has no idea how to fix it, which is where your character comes in * My character gets kidnapped by people looking to ransom her. Either she escapes and your character finds her or your character helps her escape * Your character is some lowly employee at the coffee shop my character always goes to, and finally decides to strike up a conversation Im also open to adding furry elements if you wish. Hit me up at AlexWhitewood and I'll send you my list of kinks."

I can do anime and furry base pictures I prefer realistic faces or descriptions but I can adapt. I would love to work together and come up with a plot with my partners pertaining to something in my list. ***Plots I am accepting*** * Mafia Related * Anything Based Victorian times * Pirate Plots * Vampyr Related (Game) * Fallout Related * Steampunk or Cyberpunk * Cyborg Plots * Superhero (Marvel or DC) * Arranged Marriages * anything you think might catch my interest. Prompts **Doctor Control Yourself** Industrial era of London were are facing the worsed case of the flu. YC is a Doctor and many people look for him to solve this horrid epidemic it he doesnt know how. Hes stuck working nights due to his own recent sickness being turned into a vampire has took its toll when hes around a wounded patient its very hard to control himself and here lately he suspects that hes been caught that someone knows what he is. And he is right. This plot is rough Ive been playing a lot of Vampyr and it came to me slightly what if a nurse someone he might be fond of found out. This is that plot. **Sing me something sweet...** She was a ranger a damn good one at that. She grew up in the Texas republic to the south taking care of most of the raiders that inhabited there. Now with Vegas and the Dam secure and being posted at the NCR outpost in the Vegas. Shes bored taking up a singing job in the tops. He well can be anyone really but hes been visiting her listening to her sweet voice. **Furry Slave** YC has lived the life of luxury he can get anyone he wants in the world as his. But he refused to have some gold digger in his life. Hes growing lonely due to the fact he doesnt want someone that will take his money. After time hes choose to purchase a slave to warm his bed clean and cook much like a wife would. He didnt know most of these slaves were furries and the one he picked was a lot younger looking then he thought. **Boss Gift** YC was the leader of a large crime syndicate in Vegas making his money in counterfeit cash. He made in big in the past 20 years but his consistent workings made it hard to have a family and his buddies and works know so on his birthday the secured him a gift. A Russian bride they called her but in reality shes a women they bought from the blackmarket meant to be his slave but could he make her his wife. **Mending his Heart** YC had married out of highschool his wife was pretty fun and everything he wanted in life. Though people change not even five years in the real world they began fight bickering and couldnt stand each others he never understood why. Though things began to go dark he saw less of him he worked payed bills and slept everything was fine though he had a sneaking suspicion she was cheating. He didnt want to know. Their relationship had began to grow it seemed they were back in a livening relationship then living in a struggle enough they started discussing children. They had ended up pregnant a few times but her body would always reject the baby which made it harder for him to live with since time took a toll and the doctor gave them the worse news. They were married ten years no kids and after a while they began to distance themselves. He wanted to help her with the depression and she wanted a divorce. MC is a lawyer a rather good one. She deals with divorce and child custody cases mainly. Shes not married but shes pregnant with her first child. Shes recently divorced from her ex husband that choose his mistress over her. She is the one that YC wife hired for the case but YC wife doesnt know that YC and MC know each other though her ex husband. **Cyberpunk Plot** The Time is 2152 a time were the economic standpoint on life was very much separated. Depending on where you fell on the economic pyramid was the depiction of where you lived in life. The places to live at the time were three very different places of life. Heaven's Gate was a clean and organized environment that kept high above the rest. They were your politicians your higher classed individuals that had no imperfections no cyber enhancements of any kind the perfect human being. The Surface was the place the middle class lived and made their lives work. They were allowed small imperfections that could be slightly corrected by enhancements but nothing to major could be corrected. Then there was Underground or otherwise called by the locals Purgatory. It was a crime riddled slum used to getting the hand be downs of the Surface never getting their fair share in life even if their the reasons the Surface and Heavens Gates power comes from. This large underground city is made up of three major gangs that control the people. The Almighty, Black Widows and Reapers. The Almighty having control over the mines and casinos making sure that people are working keeping in line. They are the real reason that Underground hasnt torn itself apart when the separation happened. The Widow's is an all girls gang that controls most nightlife and prostitution paying taxes to the Almighty. They make sure people are fed and taken care of. The Reapers are the newest of all the gangs but the most criminal. They take what they want and even make all the drugs in the underground keeping people addicted to drugs and profiting from it. This is still in development but Id love to design it further but need someone willing to help me or we could do it along the way have no real story here but I do have a slight idea for it. Involving the Leaders of both the Widows and the Almighty having a thing. Username:: Lunastasia"

Hes a sweet man, always doting on Muse A with her favorite books and rare flowers, but hes up to his ears in debt after borrowing money from the wrong people. One afternoon, Muse As father is confronted by Muse B, the ruthless crime boss of the city. Few people have ever seen Muse Bs face, as his henchmen usually do his dirty work, but everyone knows his name and cowers in fear appropriately. Muse As father owes Muse B a considerable debt, which he cannot pay. Rather than kill the man, Muse B offers a trade  the man's beautiful daughter in exchange for the forgiveness of his financial debts. He has one night to make this deal happen or Muse B will come for him. When Muse As father explains the predicament to her, she is willing to go, as long as it ensures the safety of her family and her father promises to put an end to his troublesome gambling habits. Muse A moves in to Muse Bs mansion outside of town the following day. From the moment Muse A arrives, Muse B is on his best behavior, lavishing her with gifts  a library wing for her, a pretty garden filled with the finest, imported roses  jewelry, and so on. Gradually, Muse A comes to see that Muse B isnt a horrible person, behind closed doors, but the circumstances of their arrangement (and the terrible crimes he commits as a crime boss) make it difficult for her to fall in love with him as hes fallen in love with her. Each time Muse B proposes marriage, Muse A refuses. Muse A becomes terribly homesick and begs to be allowed to visit her father. Muse B allows her to leave him as long as she returns to him within a weeks time. While Muse A is away, Muse B is attacked by a disloyal bunch of conspiring underlings. When Muse A returns, she finds Muse B wounded and left for dead in his home office. She realizes in this moment that she does love him and if he recovers shell marry him. Her quick actions save his life and once he is well enough, they marry. **Optional Twists** Dark Twist: Once Muse B recovers, Muse A willingly becomes part of the crime business. Together they seek revenge against those who betrayed Muse B. Romantic/Angst Twist: Once Muse B recovers, Muse B gives up his life of crime, since hes assumed to be dead and he and Muse A run away together, with the condition that Muse A can never return home to her family. **Medieval Fantasy Themed Plot** Saraphina was considered to be the most beautiful maiden in the land.

Nights passed the prince married his bride and became King in short time but lived happily with his queen in a short time. He was soon assassinated by an unknown man that came in the night described as a shadow like being. Non had suspected the queen of such nature but it was her that had brought down the King with her own magic granted to her by a beast that had protected the kingdom from a time Dragons ruled.

Years Passed and The Princess that was born to the Queen and the Dragon was raised into a fine young woman destined for greatness. Her mother's magic being passed to her as a gift from her real father. Seraphine soon passed leaving her daughter to rule. All good things do come to an end.

Prohibition Era Mafia Plot~ The 1920's saw the start of Prohibition which forbids the selling or consumption of alcohol at all times apart from in Church. The Government thought the banning of Alcohol would see a decrease in crime...but it had the opposite effect. This is when the Mobsters of America's underground saw an opening. Importing and selling alcohol to earn themselves money. It was a time of partying and organized crime was at its highest. Gang's opened speakeasies where Alcohol was sold to the public in. 100,000 Speakeasies were open in New York during this period as long as you knew where they were and if you had the password to get in then you can buy alcohol just as easily as before the law. In comes the two main Gangs of New York City: The Corleone and the Maranzano family. Before the Prohibition law they were at somewhat a mutual agreement with each other. However now with each Gang drooling for more and more money being brought in by the importation and selling of Alcohol, they have crossed one another's paths and severe disagreements have cropped up. Problems among family members, money issues, and other problems also make the lives more difficult of these mobsters. Each of the Family has a beloved Child that they treasure, Muse A belongs to the Corleone while Muse B belongs to the Maranzano, both Muses are cold-hearted and only care for their families until they both meet each other in a gunfight and secretly became friends and then lovers. With their relationship, Will they end their Families Rivalry using their Relationship? or Will they be forced to kill each other and get rid of their relationship? "

What I consider a roleplay: A story written by two people taking turns filling out the action and what happens in the story. There's sex involved, but the story doesn't exist to move the scene to the next round of sex. The sex compliments the story, not the other way around * I like a more long term style, where we can reply when we have time rather than the fast paced only roleplay when we're both available kind. * I only play third person, and expect you to follow basic roleplay standards: don't kill my character, don't control my character, avoid excessive one liners, etc. You can play in first person if you wish. * I want to play a character. Nothing to do with me. I will not send pictures. My characters, past the kinks, are not based on me. I'm perfectly happy with the dom I have, I'm not looking for an irl or online dom. * Semi-lit at least, please. Be able to at least make a paragraph on a regular basis * Very few limits. I'm willing to cater to specific kinks but be clear which ones. I don't want to guess what I'm catering to. No limits on the graphicness/tabboo-ness of the sex, gore, violence. I thrive on the violent depravity of others * A list of my kinks and will be sent when you message me. * My subs are usually extremely masochistic * I prefer there to be more than just smut, but smut is a definite focus. So less cyber, more story. This means preferably more than a few sentences each post. I'd also prefer to play characters, not ourselves. That's a bit too cyber-y for me -- Now, my ideas. Theyre all flexible and most of them can have my character as either an adult or a teenager, up to you: * Supers typically develop their powers at puberty and are sent to special schools to teach them how to control their powers and (if they want) become heroes. My girl is a late bloomer, so by the time shes sent to the school, shes the only one her age who cant control their powers. Your character could be a teacher or another student who helps her, or one who decides to bully and take advantage of her for her lack of control. * My character is a super who uses her powers for petty crime. One day she targets the secret identity of either a well known hero or villain, and instead of arresting/killing her, they take her as an apprentice, whether she wants it or not. * My character is a new hero/villain who gets in way over her head due to inexperience. Shes saved by a veteran hero/villain and they take her on as an apprentice. * My character comes from a long line of heroes, but has no desire to be one. Instead she gets caught up with a gang of disgruntled supers who are slowly turning from petty criminals to actual villains. After an incident that gets way out of hand, a fight breaks out between the citys heroes and the gang. She winds up fighting a relative who quickly realizes who she is. * My character is a superhero by night, and a normal person by day. She usually works closely with another hero, but has no idea she also knows him in real life. One day, however, he realizes shes the heroine hes been working with for so long. * My character is an assassin, her powers used to make her one of the best in the world. But shes sent on a mission against an organization far more dangerous and prepared than anyone realized, and it goes terribly wrong. * Being a super is against the law and anyone arrested for having powers is never seen again. My character has either been hiding for a while and gets complacent or just gets her powers and your character catches her. Hes another hidden super, and can either blackmail her or take her under his wing * My character is a super who, as a child, was captured by a circus in a world where supers are incredibly rare. Abused and forced to perform, shes also sold on the side by the ring master between shows. Your character is dragged to the circus and cant help but feel so much horror and pity for her, he breaks her out and nurses her back to health. We can come up with an overarching plot if you like, or just make it PWP, I don't mind. I'm also open to other plots as long as it involves superpowers. Im also open to adding furry elements if you wish. Hit me up at AlexWhitewood and I'll send you my list of kinks."

12,cyber crime,Roleplaykik,M4A Cyberpunk: 2120,1,7pcamp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/7pcamp/m4a_cyberpunk_2120/,2018-01-10 13:04:31,"By the year 2050, the United States Government had approved funding for Research Facilities and Corporations dedicated to the development and production of the first Cybernetic implants. The CEO's and Spokespersons for the Researchers spear heading these projects boasted this would be a major leap within the Scientific Community. Going as far as to claim by the next generation people would witness The Singularity. The belief that technology would evolve to levels so great that in turn it would lead to an evolution of man, thanks to machinery being so ingrained into our every day lives. The first models of implants were quickly being put into development with the approval of Congress and support of the U.S. and N.A.T.O. backed Military Arms. By 2062, the first models of Cybernetic, Mechanical and Neurological implants were finally operational and being sold or distributed. Many of them either going to Active-Duty Servicemen, recovering Veterans of war or to those with suffering from major psychological and physical trauma. These augmentations quickly rose to popularity and became a trend with Millennials due to their affordability, variety of uses and surplus. Of course, some controversy had arisen with the production and sale of these implants. Mostly from a dwindling minority of Conservatives and Skeptic community, who feared that either mankind was playing God by using this type of machinery or that in an unforeseeable future the economy would collapse. Believing the amount of money and resources put into the production of implants was far greater than the net profit the Government and Companies gained from them. This would all fall on deaf ears, Researchers believing that they had either invested far too much time in their projects to shut it down so abruptly, that these fears were just fabrications to slander the Company name or that those not among their community weren't intelligent enough to understand the greatness of The Singularity. Production and research of new Cybernetics went on with the time. In 2075, marked as the age of the ""New Crime Wave; Cybernetics were now being distributed and used in nearly every corner of the world. Many third world countries using them to create their own Paramilitaries to defend their villages against War Lords, others creating underground markets to sell stronger but less stable Implants for any Cyber Junkie crazy enough to buy them. The more daring person formed their own Crime Syndicates, using the accessible augmentations to their advantage to reign terror upon the weak and for their own personal gain. The Law Enforcement was easily suppressed and backed to a corner, many of them under-equipped and under-trained to deal with a new wave of criminals who had such devastating power at their finger tips. Most of the time they weren't able to take in the ones they managed to stop alive. This fueled the Skeptic community, who made one last effort to push for a bill that would permanently ban all Cybernetics and any further development in hopes to restore the already staggering economy and put an end to this destructive crime wave. In 2090, the United States pushed a mandatory order for all active duty Law Enforcement, Federal Agents and Armed Servicemen to be fitted with appropriate Cybernetic and Nano-Augmentations to combat the concerning rise in crime and insurgency. The economy now crumbling with the value of the Petro-Dollar collapsing. World Governments everywhere suffering from the blow back leading to massive civil unrest and instability of the masses. One by one nations began to fall apart to riots and attempted revolutions, many world leaders agreeing to U.N. intervention and Blue Helmets marching upon their borders. The few governments and wealthy elites now turning their investments to space travel, with hopes of colonizing and terra-forming fertile Planets in hopes of harvesting new resources and escape the looming threat approaching humanity. 2120: Half of the Planet is now under proxy war against the United Nations, with delusions of grandeur or hopes to reform their own societies. Many of the wealthy and lucky have purchased a ticket to fly aboard the many vessels taking those few to the New Colonies. The United States, though a shadow of its former power still manages to stand on its last legs, most of its income now coming through imports of the New Colonies mining off the new atmospheres. Mercenary Work, Crime and other underground businesses have become prominent on Earth as a source of income. Those few hoping to one day afford a ticket to leave for the brave new worlds, where does that leave you? kik me @thesupremegentlman if you're interested "
13,cyber crime,Roleplaykik,M4F Ideas based on cannon franchises.,1,6p6o5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/6p6o5z/m4f_ideas_based_on_cannon_franchises/,2017-07-24 16:32:30,"Hello, so i was going to post these ideas in a sort of partial repost but now i'm deciding to repost them on their own and adding one to the pile. These are pretty open ended in the sense that they can just be used as a jumping board. You can play whoever you want really but like my other post i would much rather play the younger partner. I am 18 myself and have been roleplaying for about 2 years and some. 1. STALKER ( Anyone who has played the stalker games and is a fan i would love to do a roleplay of that.) 2. Steven Universe ( Boredom can take you to many strange places, one of those places being cartoon network , it doesn't have to necessarily take part in beachcity and all that, hell it could take place in another part of the world, or in space or in a different time period etc.) 3. Rainbow Six ( Now the story is pretty simple in all rainbow six games, there is a big baddy, a team gets assembled go take em down. That could work or we could perhaps make our own story, base it off the rainbow six siege operators even, i wouldn't mind.) 4. X-Com (It's pretty straight forward, i don't care if we are both operators, if we are spies, if you are an alien or not. You can play one of the handful of cannon characters too [including the commander] ) 5. NeoPD ( I might post this idea again at a later date,have it expanded on but the idea is pretty simple, we are part of the police force in the future. That's it, but depending on past events, wars, conflicts, new laws etc, the police of the future might be very different from the police we know today, we could deal from anything to petty crime, gun trafficking, android trafficking, people and android trafficking, drug cartlets, street gangs , shoot out with crazy cults or just plain crazy people, illegal cyber clinics etc etc. Really you could do anything with it. I do expect my partner to help me craft not just the story but also the history of this world since it isn't an actual cannon franchise. Another thing to note is i won't force you to play police, it would make things easier but it isn't impossible to work out non cop characters into it. ) Anything else that comes to your mind i'm most likely open to it. My kik is ThermiteC4 Hope to hear from you soon!"

There may be relationships, but I don't want full on fuckery going on. (All races are allowed! Human, furry, etc.) In the current year, 2022, the whole towns gone mad under Cyber-Military control ever since the previous riot occurred. Many clans have been created since then like The Shutting Eyes, drug runners who ran illegal trade routes throughout the night. Diamondheads, a high-tier group of organized robbers who stole from banks, mansions, and rivals. The Gamblers, many people who held sex trafficking, illegal fight clubs, and under aged gambling. Last but not least, there were Squadron 5-- they were basically the Civil Protection of the city who had their hands full of gangs and crime groups. Before everything went hectic, vigilantes were inexistent, but now there are multiple of them (who were totally unrelated, but that's changeable) putting their crimes to an end. The unique thing about this group is that you all start at recruits (you can even start as a civilian and increase your attention with every little move) and slowly build up your rankings with new privileges and control.
