0,CVEs,kubernetes,Tools to scan running images for vulnerabilities,1,fe4j9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/fe4j9d/tools_to_scan_running_images_for_vulnerabilities/,2020-03-06 10:50:14,"So I have implemented [Trivy](URL in my CICD pipeline which will scan my code &amp; their dependencies for CVEs at build time, but if a new vulnerability gets found I have no way of knowing if it exists in my current running software. I haven't been able to find any tools that are able to scan all images running on your k8s cluster for CVEs, I'm wondering if anyone has a tool or process for this? Currently I think my plan is just to setup an alert to make sure no pods are older than 90 days and if I get notified just kick off another build which should scan the image with an updated CVE list, but this feels like a pretty crappy solution."

How do you deal with responding to CVE queries?
2,CVEs,kubernetes,OSS tool that scans containers running in your cluster for CVEs?,1,eelusu,https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/eelusu/oss_tool_that_scans_containers_running_in_your/,2019-12-24 02:18:41,Does anyone know of such a tool that's free or are most Enterprise? Having a webui of the exploits would be solid.
3,CVEs,kubernetes,Vuln scanning K8s clusters,1,an0mam,https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/an0mam/vuln_scanning_k8s_clusters/,2019-02-04 22:00:55,"Hi all. We run multiple kops-built kubernetes clusters in AWS. Our Security guys want us to scan the clusters for vulnerabilities - by this they mean scanning EC2 instances and subnets to check for exposed network services, CVEs, etc using tools such as Nessus. The sec guys are new to k8s so don't really have a strong grasp of what it is or how it changes security posture, but I personally think the request is fair enough.. Does anyone else run host/network-level scanning against clusters? Is there any recommended tooling for this? I've considered Nessus and AWS Inspector, but Inspector isn't available in our region, and I assume Nessus will result in many false-positives due to it not understanding the k8s workload. Thanks. PS. we already run CLAIR scans on our images (the results of which do not make pleasant reading - that's a separate issue!) but obviously this doesn't give us host/network scanning. "
