My server has secured boot- disabled. So understand that already vulnerable to other boot loader defects? But how realistic such boot loader/grub related attacks are? Insider attack? 2. Now, if I want to enable secure boot options are there really critical CVEs against it so that I am defending against by enabling it? I want to experiment to know how easy/difficult to exploit. 3. Just turning on secure boot suffices on BIOS settings or need digital certificates etc for point number 2? Is there a procedure for it? Thank you very much for your suggestions."

Lots of great interviews URL (RSS available) Southern Fried Security Podcast - Martin Fisher is a CISO of a major Healthcare org in Atlanta, and has a cadre of great people on the show, including Evette Johnson and Steve Ragan from CSOOnline magazine URL StepToe Cyberlaw podcast - I just started listening to this one, to better understand privacy and security laws RSS: URL Paul's Security Weekly - Another long running show, many well-known veteran's of the industry.

Tickets sell out fast, but lobbyCon is excellent for networking and discussion URL There are ISC2 events as well: URL ISSA does events - URL RSA is usually in February, more of an 'industry' event, meaning a huge vendor pit, but there are some excellent talks given, some with a vendor selling bent, but not overly awful... tickets and hotel location are a bit pricey (URL SANS has several events, in addition to their excellent (if somewhat expensive) training. List of training opportunities are here: URL And of course, there's Black Hat (URL and Defcon (URL a bit more expensive, but just a glut of infosec people, hacker villages dealing IoT hacking, CTFs abound, SocEng events CanSecWest, Source, Infiltrate, local defcon Chapters, Austin Hackers Anonymous (AHA), Hack in the Box, local hacker/makerspaces, and loads of others... so get on Twitter or check /r/netsec for add'l information. **Videos** IronGeek's site - Adrian Crenshaw started recording B-Sides events, and it grew from there. He has probably the largest number of speaker videos from nearly a hundred events over the years... again, 1 hour video = 1 CPE). You can find talks from many infosec cons that you may have missed, or were not able to attend... and all free.... a most excellent site. URL Feel free to add add'l items to this list... if it gets big enough, maybe it'll get a sticky. Just trying to help people who might be struggling for CPEs. The other good thing about infosec cons is they often hold training before, during, and after the event. B-Sides events are good for that. "
