These options will be accompanied by a proof of postage certificate upon shipping but if you'd like to add tracking please let me know because those mailing options cost more. - **Prices are listed in both GBP and USD for your convenience**, and if you'd like help converting them or your total to other currencies just let me know. - **The minimum spend is 5/$6** before shipping. - **Payment will be taken via PayPal through Family and Friends, goods and services, or invoice, whichever you prefer.** I don't mind covering the fees if you're more comfortable with one of the latter. - **Items are listed within their categories,** which include Face, Lips, Eyes, etc. - **Items that have been paid for will be marked with a ~~strikethrough.~~ If you want something that's marked as *Pending* or that another person has asked about, feel free to jump in line in case it falls through!** I'll always follow up to let you know either way, and I go by time stamps to keep things fair. - **Please plan to respond in a timely fashion, or give me a heads up that you'll be away from Reddit.** If you don't I may move on to the next interested person. - **I am open to reasonable offers** so please feel free to negotiate! I'm not married to the prices I've listed, and I'm happy to help out with shipping costs. I really want to get these things moved in with folks who will love and use 'em. - **There are a few minis and other items in practically every category that are free on request with purchase as well as being available to buy.** You're very welcome to choose one of these to accompany the stuff you're buying, or purchase as many as you'd like! I've tried to price them quite low anyway. - **I've included basic shade descriptions** but I encourage you to check for swatches and reviews. :) - All items are in good saleable condition.

I am new to swapping and selling on Reddit, but have ample experience swapping on MUA before it closed and still actively sell on eBay. Here's what you need to know. * Prices do not include shipping. * U.S. shipping ONLY. Shipping will start at $3.00 and may increase depending on package weight. Please note that I do my best to pack items securely with bubble wrap which may increase package weight! * Paypal gifting is preferred so there's no fees on either end, but I am totally fine invoicing you if that is what makes you most comfortable. Please cover the fees if invoiced. * $5 minimum preferred, please. * I live in Michigan and we've had some crazy weather this winter. I will do my best to ship out all packages on Saturdays, weather permitting, and will keep you posted! * I live in a home with a cat. She does not come in my room or near my makeup. I also smoke, but not in the house, and always wash my hands before handling my makeup. With that said, everything will be sanitized to the best of my ability prior to shipment. * Please let me know if you decide to pass. If I don't hear from you within 2 hours and we haven't worked out a deal, I'll move on to the next person interested unless we discuss otherwise. * I am mostly looking to sell as I need money to renew my employment authorization, but am open to swapping for particular items. * [Flair Thread] (URL **WISHLIST** * Guerlain Meteorites (I'm NW10, so whatever shade may work for me?) * Lime Crime Cashmere * ABH Liquid Lipsticks; not sure which shades so offer! * LORAC Mega Pro * NARS Audacious Lipsticks; Anna in particular but offer! * UD Revolution Sheer Lipsticks; not sure which shades so offer anything but F-Bomb! * Liquid foundations that may work for me.
