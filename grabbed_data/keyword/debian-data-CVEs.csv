Also [here](URL &gt; The Linux kernel is a security disaster and &gt; The userspace Linux desktop software stack is far worse relative to the others. Security and privacy are such low priorities. It's really a complete joke and it's hard to even choose where to start in terms of explaining how bad it is. There's almost a complete disregard for sandboxing / privilege separation / permission models, exploit mitigations, memory safe languages (lots of cultural obsession with using memory unsafe C everywhere), etc. and there isn't even much effort put into finding and fixing the bugs. Look at something like Debian where software versions are totally frozen and only a tiny subset of security fixes receiving CVEs are backported, the deployment of even the legacy exploit mitigations from 2 decades ago is terrible and work on systems integration level security features like verified boot, full system MAC policies, etc. is near non-existent. That's what passes as secure though when it's the opposite. When people tell you that Debian is secure, it's like someone trying to claim that Windows XP with partial security updates (via their extended support) would be secure. It's just not based in any kind of reality with any actual reasoning / thought behind it. Here's [one](URL about his (reluctant) laptop recommendations: &gt; If you really must have a recommendation that's suitable for regular people, then get either a Chromebook or a Macbook and use the standard OS with the security features intact. What are your opinions?"

2,CVEs,debian,Debian contains insecure version of Chromium that is not receiving security updates for months?,33,cp1mro,https://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/cp1mro/debian_contains_insecure_version_of_chromium_that/,2019-08-12 06:07:13,"Chromium browser in Debian is provided by chromium package [URL It can be argued that Chromium is one of the most used and security critical graphical applications used by Debian desktop users. Chromium is also endorsed in latest Debian buster release notes: [URL states that ""For general web browser use we recommend Firefox or Chromium."" Looking at [URL and [URL we can see that both buster and stretch currently contain Chromium version 73.0.3683.75 that is vulnerable to 53 security issues with assigned CVEs and that last update to chromium in buster and stretch was made more than 4 months ago. Right now I cannot find any other major Linux distro that contains so outdated version of Chromium in its official repositories (looking at Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, etc.). I do not see how not updating browser more than 4 months could be considered secure in modern era. Do Debian users / maintainers think that this is acceptable because ""none of the CVEs have 9.5/10 severity level"" or ""stable is stable""? If we asked 10 people with web browser security background to grade this chromium 73 version security wise 1 to 10, what would be expected result? Would this chromium version be considered OK for daily use, not really recommended or very bad?"
3,CVEs,debian,Status of PHP7.0 in Stretch,7,7mdfpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/7mdfpo/status_of_php70_in_stretch/,2017-12-27 17:43:28,"Hi everyone! I'm using Debian Stretch (actually Raspbian but the problem comes from Debian side) with PHP7.0. Debian Stretch (9) has PHP 7.0.19 which is vulnerable and was not fixed. All those bugs are fixed in Testing and Unstable. So, my questions is what is the status of PHP7? Are those CVEs are not so important? For me, it looks like Debian is not a good choice without updates. Some issues may be with Low severity but some are with Medium Severity. Here are the link to where information is posted: URL"
