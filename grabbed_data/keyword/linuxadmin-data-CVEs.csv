1,CVEs,linuxadmin,How do you stay informed about new CVEs and security updates?,48,7416y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/7416y7/how_do_you_stay_informed_about_new_cves_and/,2017-10-04 02:38:51,"For whatever reason I am having a hard time coming up with a reliable way to keep on top of newly discovered vulnerabilities. I initially had the idea of adding an RSS feed to my jira/confluence dashboard, but atlassian make this way more difficult than it needs to be. While it's not a common occurrence, there are times that I am notified of vulnerabilities within our systems from colleagues outside of my team. Of course I am open to their observations and input, but I can't help but feel a little embarrassed that I did not discover them first. I am curious as to how this is handled in other businesses. Do you have a good way of tracking these events? *Edit: formatting*"

Updates to [Anchore.io](URL include: The updates made to the previous Navigator service include: - Private Repositories: Allowing you to setup private repositories to be scanned by Anchore. - A Graphical Policy Editor: The new graphical policy editor allows you define your own custom policies and map which policies are used with which images. The policy editor supports CVE whitelisting - allowing a curated set of CVEs to be excluded from security vulnerability alerts. - Expanded Notifications: In addition to image update notifications the Anchore Navigator can now alert you by email when CVEs have been added or removed from your image and when the policy status of your image has changed, for example an image that previously passed is now failing policy evaluation. Your feedback would be extremely helpful, so if you have a minute head over to [URL and take a look Thanks!"
3,CVEs,linuxadmin,cvechk.net - New way to review Red Hat CVEs,22,63wegs,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/63wegs/cvechknet_new_way_to_review_red_hat_cves/,2017-04-07 08:37:33,"[cvechk.net](URL is a new web based application I have been working on. You feed it any text containing CVEs and it will spit back Red Hat advisories, errats, and packages which fix said CVE. Right now it is limited to Red Hat 6 and 7, and the matching CentOS releases, but I am working toward Ubuntu support as well. I am looking for feedback on both the concept and site. Yes it is a bit bare, but I want it to be quick and functional rather than flashy. Source code is also available on GitHub for anyone who is interested in contributing."

5,CVEs,linuxadmin,Foreman and ubuntu patching - can you make it fancy and granular?,4,5az0lb,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/5az0lb/foreman_and_ubuntu_patching_can_you_make_it_fancy/,2016-11-04 06:59:52,"Foreman (with katello) seems to be a dream alternative to redhat satellite and now more or less defunct spacewalk. It has Eratta support: URL Also appears to be able to patch CentOS (which has no official eratta though but good enough). Katello seems only to be used for Yum based distributions. Would there be a way to build a similar system for Ubuntu? Maybe input Ubuntu USN and use as eratta or simply fetch all available patches and somehow present them in the foreman user interface? Preferably with checkboxes for each package I want to update. I'm not really sure how to accomplish this, sounds much like I need to learn how to write plugin to accomplish this in a more fancy manner. Maybe this is rocket science, and I am doomed to bluntly run apt-get upgrade and such through remote execution/ansible jobs in foreman..? Anyone of you have experience with a more controlled and granular ubuntu patching (or debian for that matter) using at least foreman?"
6,CVEs,linuxadmin,Vulnerability Scanners,16,4w577q,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/4w577q/vulnerability_scanners/,2016-08-05 01:55:59,We currently use Retina from BeyondTrust and I am never happy when Security produces a report. For example I had a report listing multiple Kernel Vulnerabilities going back over 2 years but the report shows we have the latest kernel applied which has all of the mentioned CVEs fixed. Another would be NTP. It looks at the version and flags it as high because it is 4.2 and not 5.0 and provides a CVE. You look up the CVE and it shows it doesn't apply to this version of RHEL. I run into the same problems with Ubuntu. So is there a Vulnerability Scanner out there that will produce accurate reports? or am I going to be dealing with this regardless of the software used? Thanks in advance.

Running CentOs 5.11 Apache 2.2.3 Currently missing CVE-2015-3183 I've ran yum update httpd but it doesn't kick back any available updates, so I would assume it's up to date. When I ran rpm -q --changelog | grep -i CVE , I don't see ANY 2015 CVEs installed. Was just made aware of this missing one by a security PCI audit our organization has every month. Any insight on what might be the issue? Thanks!"
