I have an Asus tablet model # K011. It still works OK however the last update for it was in 2014. As a result it's vulnerable to at least 5 stagefright CVEs. I get that Asus can't support devices forever but why can't they unlock the bootloader? It seems ridiculous to abandon a device and leave no straightforward way to unlock it so that devs can create a custom ROM for it once they've decided to EOL the support. So it's essentially a paperweight as I think it's irresponsible to even use a device that hasn't had an update since 2014. Just ranting really. I suppose I could try harassing Asus to unlock the bootloader but that's too much effort and their support is so so very bad."
