3,CVEs,sysadmin,AV scanning on UNIX - do you?,1,ducyvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/ducyvj/av_scanning_on_unix_do_you/,2019-11-11 02:41:38,"I made a post mocking AV scanning on UNIX in another thread and got immediately downvoted for it. I was interested why someone would do that and tried to get a discussion going, but the thread went under. So I'm starting this. In the other thread, the main argument for running antivirus software on a UNIX server was compliance with regulations. I'm interested how many of you are actually affected by such regulations, which specific laws or rules those are and whether you agree with them. IMO, unless they're a hard requirement for your business, an admin concerned with actual security rather than checkbox security should push back hard on them because ""proper"" AV software actually *increases* attack surface on UNIX. As far as I'm aware, the state of the art in AV software, since *signature-based scanning* has proven to be unreliable with unacceptably high rates of false positives or worse, false negatives, is *behavioural analysis*. Putting what's basically a Windows execution environment with an unknown and and uproven security posture (and possibly has to run as root, lol) on an otherwise secure server is conceptualy unacceptable for me. In such a setup, the AV software itself becomes the largest attack surface. If you have kept an eye out for interesting CVEs, it has been shown time and again that AV software itself can be leveraged for any number of techniques an attacker can use to sucessfully breach a system. No AV vendor has acknowledged this conceptual weakness. As far as I'm aware, no vendor is using an open, auditable ""sandbox"" environment as part of their scanning engine or at least providing certification of said environment by an external code auditor. This translates to: *A motivated and determined attacker can find exploitable weaknesses with 100% certainty*. With that in mind, your choice is to either use ineffective signate-based scanning or open yourself up to a breach not just on an endpoint, but with immediate server-level access, potentially straight to root. Or to not use AV software at all. What do you choose and why? &amp;#x200B; &gt;Excercise for the reader: upload 42.zip, a simple and well-known [archive bomb](URL to virustotal. Watch the signature-based engines tell you lies about what it is and those engines that insist on unpacking it for scanning explode (lol timeout). Would you trust these vendors to be the gatekeepers of your security posture?"

10,CVEs,sysadmin,Meltdown and Spectre,314,7nyhc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7nyhc5/meltdown_and_spectre/,2018-01-04 09:56:01,"&gt; Meltdown and Spectre exploit critical vulnerabilities in modern processors. These hardware bugs allow programs to steal data which is currently processed on the computer. While programs are typically not permitted to read data from other programs, a malicious program can exploit Meltdown and Spectre to get hold of secrets stored in the memory of other running programs. This might include your passwords stored in a password manager or browser, your personal photos, emails, instant messages and even business-critical documents. URL Looks like this is the official information release of the CPU bugs discussed over the past few days. Academic papers and Q&amp;A are provided in the link. Official CVEs: * CVE-2017-5715 * CVE-2017-5753 * CVE-2017-5754 **Meltdown Abstract** &gt; The security of computer systems fundamentally relies on memory isolation, e.g., kernel address ranges are marked as non accessible and are protected from user access. In this paper, we present Meltdown. Meltdown exploits side effects of out of-order execution on modern processors to read arbitrary kernel-memory locations including personal data and passwords. Out-of-order execution is an indispensable performance feature and present in a wide range of modern processors. The attack is independent of the operating system, and it does not rely on any software vulnerabilities. Meltdown breaks all security assumptions given by address space isolation as well as paravirtualized environments and, thus, every security mechanism building upon this foundation. On affected systems, Meltdown enables an adversary to read memory of other processes or virtual machines in the cloud without any permissions or privileges, affecting millions of customers and virtually every user of a personal computer. We show that the KAISER defense mechanism for KASLR [8] has the important (but inadvertent) side effect of impeding Meltdown. We stress that KAISER must be deployed immediately to prevent large-scale exploitation of this severe information leakage. **Spectre Abstract** &gt; Modern processors use branch prediction and speculative execution to maximize performance. For example, if the destination of a branch depends on a memory value that is in the process of being read, CPUs will try guess the destination and attempt to execute ahead. When the memory value finally arrives, the CPU either discards or commits the speculative computation. Speculative logic is unfaithful in how it executes, can access to the victims memory and registers, and can perform operations with measurable side effects. &gt; Spectre attacks involve inducing a victim to speculatively perform operations that would not occur during correct program execution and which leak the victims confidential information via a side channel to the adversary. This paper describes practical attacks that combine methodology from side channel attacks, fault attacks, and return-oriented programming that can read arbitrary memory from the victims process. More broadly, the paper shows that speculative execution implementations violate the security assumptions underpinning numerous software security mechanisms, including operating system process separation, static analysis, containerization, just-in-time (JIT) compilation, and countermeasures to cache timing/side-channel attacks. These attacks represent a serious threat to actual systems, since vulnerable speculative execution capabilities are found in microprocessors from Intel, AMD, and ARM that are used in billions of devices. &gt; While makeshift processor-specific countermeasures are possible in some cases, sound solutions will require fixes to processor designs as well as updates to instruction set architectures (ISAs) to give hardware architects and software developers a common understanding as to what computation state CPU implementations are (and are not) permitted to leak."

13,CVEs,sysadmin,[Opinion] Leadership in Tech,49,6yrjyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/6yrjyc/opinion_leadership_in_tech/,2017-09-08 11:10:28,"Hello /r/sysadmin, been a long time since I wrote an actual post. Earlier this week yet another IT Manager thread popped up and yet there was another time [This Article](URL - Opinion: The unspoken truth about managing geeks. While I think this article has some merit and I do think the intentions of this article are meant to be positive and a good thing, I think it just misses too many points. /u/anarchicforce mentioned they would like to hear more of my thoughts on this, and here is my [OP](URL on that post. So a quick background of me. I have been working in IT for almost 2x decades. Started in the late 90s doing Novell/Windows stuff and Desktop Support and hardware repair. I landed my first job straight out of high school with zero experience as I was going into college at 18 years old. Since then I have had many different jobs, worked internationally in both Europe and Asia, been a consultant, worked for tech companies, worked in vendor space, and earlier in my career worked for a school system and the local government. I now work for a large well known company which I will not name. I have never been officially a manager before, but I have had people report to me. I have been lead on many projects. Basically I have done some manager type stuff, but never the HR part. I have never done reviews, discipline, or any of those type managerial duties. I have done a lot of the planning, scoping, business engagement, and mentor to people under me. I am based in Silicon Valley and I do 100% Linux and Mac stuff 0% Windows Microsoft stuff, infrastructure, services, apps, middleware, integration, tooling, cloud stuff, etc. The opinions of that article linked above are very different from my experience and my opinions. In fact, I would say while some of it is true, and some of it is accurate, it ultimately creates an unhealthy work space for IT professionals. It also perpetuates bad practices and dysfunctional IT. This is me not talking shit on every company out there either, trust me, every company has its dysfunctions and esoteric problems. This is me having been privileged enough to actually work under some great leadership, and grow as a person and professionally. So, what worked for me, and what I view as a good set of high level areas for leaders to focus on to create a productive, happy and healthy tech department. So here they are in no particular order: * Build a team. Do not try to silo your IT pros into specific roles. You can split the services, but not the roles. What I mean by this is that there should be a support service and an engineering service. The support service does the customer interaction. They are the help desk, desk side support, hardware techs, field techs, and all the escalation points you have for each of those roles. They support the customer. The engineering side builds things. They build workflows, infrastructure, meet business requirements, implement projects and so forth. The teams on those services should work as teams. Do not silo a person off and say you are the mail server person, and you are the firewall person, and you are the software deployment person. Instead have the team work as a team. Have them cross train, discuss, plan and implement things at a project level together. Let each of them have a say, and each of them be able to put effort and input into everything the team handles. You can have SMEs, you can have leads, but let the team make decisions. If there is an issue where a decision cannot be made the SME or owner or whatever decides. You will accomplish so much more as a team than you ever will with one or two people being silo'd off doing their own thing. * Do not call your end users, end users. Call them ~~customers~~ coworkers. IT provides many services, and while a lot of times they are not customer facing to the public, they are customer facing internally. Your end users are your ~~customers~~ coworkers and you want to make them happy. You want to enable them to do their jobs. You are their colleagues and their partners in the organization, do not forget that, and drive that culture in. Edited this post due to /u/WhiskeyRider69 's suggestion on changing the mindset from customer to coworker and I like that better. However, this might be splitting hairs since I have heard the term ""customer"" a ton. Either way keep the old view of end user out. * The Managing Geeks article talks about being right as a currency. That IT pros will often let egotism and elitism slide if someone can produce a high level of good work. This is such a toxic thing to allow to happen. Check your ego at the door. No one wants to work with a jerk, and this type of behavior only creates a toxicity and resentment. Instead of working under the currency of right vs wrong, as an IT leader you need to enable your teams, you need to inspire them. When I look at where I want to work, I ask myself is my leadership enabling me? Do I have access to all the tools, training, resources, and everything else I need to be enabled to do my job? Is my team supporting me, and am I supporting my team? If you want top talent at your Org, enable them to be top talent. Do not micromanage, do not set the vision or the tone on every single thing. Let them self drive their work. I create 80% of my own work in our JIRA board because I am enabled to do so. I am constantly improving things left and right because I am enabled to do so. I will collect data and test changes in our testing environments and collect data off of that, because I am enable to create my own work. Sure I get requirements from management, but I am never told how to meet those requirements. Instead I am just enabled to do my job, and so is everyone else on the team. As a team member enable your coworkers to gain skills. For example I have taught several people who were new to my team Python. Anyone who comes to my team has some sort of coding skills, but not always Python and we do a lot of tooling in Python. As a member of my team, if you aren't up to snuff on your skills I will mentor you, I will help you as best I can. At the same time, each team member needs to grow and learn. Leadership needs to really drive in the culture of enabling your employees, coworkers and customers. * Peer review is such an important thing. No one on the team should ever QA or review their own work. Someone else should. Don't get caught up in the ITIL CAB stuff. That stuff is honestly a waste of time. I have dealt with change advisory boards that are so hung up on the power and the process it has halted my work from being done, and some of it was critical work (deadlines, security issues, known CVEs, etc). So unless you have a really top notch kick ass CAB, that fully understands the all the stacks your teams work with, you are really just wasting everyone's time. * Have a solid process. How does someone in an engineering role go from Dev, to QA, to staging, to prod? What is the process? How do things get validated and tested? Once you figure that process out, try to automate as much as possible around it. You will make mistakes, you will fail, that is inevitable, do not worry about that up front. Each time that happens it is an opportunity to make things better. You learn much more form failure than you do success. * Team vs Individual vs Management - so if the team fails at anything, first and foremost the manager has also failed. As a leader you just need to accept this. Do not blame individuals, do not scapegoat people. Own it as a team. If someone on the team is truly a problem there should be HR processes in place to discipline them or whatever. If the team is successful, mention the entire team, and always say it was the team not a person. The problem with many IT pros is that they have egos and control issues, this even goes for management too. * You should aim to work a 40 hour work week. If the people cannot do their jobs in a 40 hour work week something is broken and as a leader you need to fix this. Burn out is real. I have been burned out before at a few jobs. No one needs an IT hero and IT heroes are a bad thing, not good. In fact you should really aim to have all the needed work done in a 32 hour work week so you can give your team some flex time for R&amp;D and training on the job. I know that is even a bigger pipe dream, but hey aim for the stars and maybe at least you'll land on the mountains. * Ticket systems are horrible, do not use them at all for engineering or project tasks. Tickets are for customers and are for support tasks. Get some project based software, and look at using Agile (or something like Agile) to plan out and build your process. It really is a game changer. Please note though that Agile, while not as bad as ITIL in my opinion, but it can be. Agile is meant to be a framework do not treat it like a religion. Tickets create a transnational and reactive IT staff. Project based IT creates a more proactive and more product IT staff. Watch [this keynote](URL at the bottom of this page to see what I am getting at. * Just because things have always been a certain way, doesn't mean they should. Likewise just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. Just because you don't understand something doesn't mean it is wrong, and just because you do understand something doesn't mean it is right. My point on this bullet is that you should always be evolving, always improving, and always pushing your team to learn and gain new skills. If you aren't automating with code you are already 15+ years behind the curve, and that is not a hyperbole. Also get rid of the dysfunctional stuff that IT classically does to itself. You are only hurting yourself doing archaic and bad things. * You have to dog food all your solutions. You need to use what you produce, ship and release. If you do not like your own workflows and environments you have created, odds are pretty high your customers also hate it. * As a manager you need to get the leadership above you to buy into what you and your team is doing/accomplishing. I can't tell you how much of a major difference that makes. When I meet with VPs and the rare occasional C-level and they buy into what our teams are doing, and they fully support us. It makes such a huge difference on so many levels. Middle managers are honestly the worst as a generalization. They often get this chip on their should and then go wage a Game of Thrones political war against every other middle managers to climb to the top. Not every middle manager can be promoted, so they all want to out do each other. I don't care how much you convince me you are not like this, every single middle manager I have ever worked with in any capacity has done this to at least some extent, or the very least they think about this. Do not be this person. Instead focus on tuning a well built team that fucking gets shit done. Trust me, once you do that and your team starts delivering it only gets better from there, you end up out performing other teams, and sometimes all the other teams. Remember it isn't a contest though, that is just simply the benefit from running a healthier IT shop, that enables people to be experts at their job, versus a dysfunctional manager that doesn't. * As a manager go to conferences with your team. Attend keynotes of people in their field. Learn as much as you can about what other Orgs are doing. This is important so you can understand why the team you manage wants to do things. Plus if you are putting an effort out there to grow and learn yourself you are leading by example, which is the best type of leadership. * fight for your team to get going market wages, and benefits if you want employee retention. I have left 2 jobs in my life that were fantastic jobs. Great bosses, great work environments, lots of freedoms but absolute crap pay. So if you want to attract top talent fight for what top talent is worth. If you cannot get approval for top talent, then formulate plans and enforce cultures to get mid level talent and build them up. Sure they will leave once they gain those skills and experience for something for more money. That will happen, you cannot stop that. However, you can still accomplish the things you want by being that type of leader, and perhaps that will help you build a case to the higher ups to actually pay and give benefits that attract top talent. * give people breaks. If a team member is having a tough time, stressed out, or maybe a personal problem. Tell them to take off a few hours early, give them an extended lunch, take the day off, whatever you can spare give it to them. You as the leader need to set the culture of health first before the job. That working smarter is better than working harder. that you actually give a shit about your team. I get it that you may not be able to do this for everyone every single time they have something come up, but when you can do it. Do it with out question and do it with out hesitation. An employee will not forget these acts pretty much ever. I can remember every single time a great manager stuck up or went out of their way to help me. I have forgotten over half of the bad managers I have worked with, but I do always remember the good ones. The fucked up part is, the good ones and those moments were rare not the norm, which is why we remember them. * Priorities of things - If everything is high priority then nothing is high priority. This goes into the whole build a process bullet I posted earlier but I feel this has enough special merit it should get its own bullet point. Thanks to /u/Karrad for reminding me of this. The process of priority needs to be clearly defined. Both at the support and the engineering level. At the support level what constitutes as a high priority or a severity 1 ticket? If everything is a sev 1, then you just made sev 1 meaningless. What are your SLAs and expected turn around time for a standard support ticket a customer puts in? Now on the engineering side this needs to do mainly with the order in which projects should be completed and it should be weighed by dependencies and business needs. If your main project is to stand up a new service you probably need to do other work before you can stand it up, there needs to be testing, and all of those things. Priority should apply to an order of operations and dictated by the most important and pressing of the business needs down to the nice to haves. As a manager you really need to drill this in. Do not make everything a high priority because in all honesty not everything is a high priority. * Know the business you are in, and make sure you do things for the Org that make the Org successful. Thanks to /u/Jeffbx for reminding me of the most basic thing I forgot to add. I just assumed that was a given. Assess the risks, qualify and quantify the stake holders, collect data, and make decisions that benefit the Org, not necessarily IT. * don't assume things, see previous point. This is about all I wanted to write at this point, feel free to upvote, downvote, tell me I am an idiot, or that I make a good point or ask any questions.

Awhile ago, my employer 'lost' our security guy, and I was asked to take on the technical part of his role because I show interest and tend to think of operations from a 'security first' perspective. There really was no formal security team, and very little in the way of process, procedure or infrastructure. Our former guy was pretty smart, but was really just making it up as he went along while doing more than should be expected of one person (including pre-sales support.) He was spread too thin and there were many things left undone. (To complicate matters, we're a company that, IMO, should be **much** more focused on infrastructure security due to our line of business.) I want to build a security organization with good tools and process infrastructure so that this can be done professionally and as a shared responsibility amongst players from our DevOps and IT teams, rather than being one reactive cowboy out there on the range with a six shooter and a few cans of beans. My experience in security is limited to what I see as the practical systems, network, and general infrastructure security required to be good engineer (which I've been doing over over 20 years.) You know, use the principle of least privilege, consider that *every* piece of information is valuable for *some* nefarious purpose and must be treated as such, turn off and uninstall stuff you don't need, make sure you stay abreast of CVEs, run security scans and pen tests, keep firewalls updated and tight, study how to harden systems, etc. All of that good stuff. I understand the technical bits (at very least on a functional level.) It's all stuff that I think (wish?) any responsible, professional sysadmin would know and do. However, I've never built a security organization nor do I feel like I have a good handle on the process infrastructure necessary to do so. I'm working on deploying and/or acquiring and/or updating the technical parts we need (firewalls, cloud security components, pen testing services, vulnerability scanners, IDS, etc.) but I need to figure out what kind of tools and processes I need to put in place to tie all of the detection and protection systems together with human factors to provide good, big-picture security. All of that said, my question is this: if you had just been handed the Director of Security role for a company and had green field in front of you, what things would you focus upon in the first week, month and year? (Keep in mind that I have limited ability to add headcount...for instance, ""go hire 3 dedicated CISSPs and start staffing up a SOC"" isn't helpful advice.) "

I'm Derek from the Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, and we have completed an audit of OpenVPN 2.4.0 with QuarksLab. You can view the synopsis of the results here, and the full report is also linked within: URL The audit resulted in two CVEs URL URL As well as a number of minor issues and fixes. I will be checking this post and answering any questions you might have about the organization, our goals, or this audit for the rest of the day today. After that I will still periodically check this post for updated questions or comments. Thank you to the 33 companies and hundreds of people that supported this effort. This happened because the community made it happen. Our next target is OpenSSL 1.1.1 which is the first version to implement TLS 1.3. The update contains a lot of code changes that give us an opportunity to review and improve the code to make it safer. The biggest way that you can contribute to us is by word of mouth. The more people hear about the positive work that we do, the more likely we are going to get donations, business contacts, and the logistical support that we need to operate and grow. We have many ways to contribute to our cause, some of them being completely cost-free. Check out our donations page to see how to help! "
