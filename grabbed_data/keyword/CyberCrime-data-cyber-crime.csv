No matter what happens throughout her day, she never misses a chance to post on social media. People who follow her on various social media platforms are updated with her routine. Ninetara adores singing and she was willing to chase her passion. She started by posting singing videos online. Things were going great for her. The melodious tunes and huge response took her to a fairy tale world. But she was feeling miserable one day. As she scrolled through the comments section on her posts she identified a person who was bullying her looks and trolling her by making memes which caused distress! Ninetara would usually ignore such comments but to make things worst he slid into her dms. She was heartbroken and began to panic after viewing the conversation. The person morphed her pictures threatening to make them viral if she refuses to reply. He forwarded screenshots of a group chat where they shared images and objectified her. Ninetara is convinced to request him not to cause her any harm and she is just a click away to accept his message. STOPPPPPPPP! What would you suggest her to do? She is fearful, let us help her!

If say that link could be made do you think that the person involved would certainly be convicted, and is this extremely hard to find evidence the reason why most cyber criminals and fraudsters are never caught?."

Small to Medium size business are victimized by hackers every day. One of the biggest misconceptions about Cyber-crime is that it only happens to the largest companies or organization and while hacks and data breaches that affect major corporations do tend to get the most publicity, that doesnt mean that small and medium-sized business arent also at risk. E-commerce is a burgeoning industry it is expected to be worth 6.7 trillion US dollars per the year 2020. And that makes the industry a huge target for hackers and cyber-criminals. And those hackers and cyber-criminals arent just focusing on the big boys, the huge companies at the top. They are targeting everyone. 60% of the small business that falls victim to being cyber-attack go out of business within 6 months. **Here are some additional facts and figures to help underscore the need for web security, regardless of the company size.**  $576 billion cyber crime cost the global economy in 2015  $15 cyber-breach claims recorded in 2015.  The cost of an average data breach in 2015 $3.79 million.  429 million identities were exposed in data breaches in 2015.  The amount cyber-issuance premiums surged in 2015 is 32%.  Average number of identities stolen per data breach in 2015 is 4885. As we have already stated, you simply cannot justify being unprepared for Cyber-crime. It can happen to any company either large or small. And its effects can be devastating. SSL is just a component of a large comprehensive security solution.

9,cyber-crime,CyberCrime,Adult Cyber Stalking &amp; Harassment,1,739d02,https://www.reddit.com/r/CyberCrime/comments/739d02/adult_cyber_stalking_harassment/,2017-09-30 03:31:29,"Hi all, my boyfriend and I need help. Over the past year we have been cyber stalked and bullied. At first it was harmless, someone we had no idea was posting rude comments on our Instagram accounts. We always ignored it, reported the profile, and then made our accounts private. It then turned into this person creating fake profiles of my boyfriend and I and tagging us in these fake profiles or pictures. This person had taken screenshots of our pictures and started using them on their fake profile. Eventually what was happening every 3 months then became every month, and now it's every week or sometimes daily. Once it started getting more aggressive this person started posting pictures of herself and short forms of her name, eventually revealing her full name entirely. Most of her posts never make any sense like she has a mental illness and is delusional and obsessive. This was finally confirmed in one of her posts about herself where she admits to being diagnosed with Schizophrenia and having recently been arrested by the police for sleeping on a park bench and having a visa that expired. Yes, she's an immigrant in Canada and has been living here without a visa. More to come on that. I will comment that during this entire time period we have reported this to all social media sites and the police. In which social media, such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram reported there wasn't anything they could do unless we sought police/legal assistance; which now brings us to our case file we opened with the police. The Toronto (Ontario, Canada) Police Cyber Department have done very little to help with this situation in fact stating ""they are not here to police social media"" and that ""just because we are offended by a few comments or posts, doesn't justify harassment or a crime"". So the police don't think impersonating us, slandering our names by calling us racists, gay, lesbians, and many more things is harassment or a crime? I do. It matters that she is impersonating us and threatening us publicly. Again, I've gotten a bit side tracked and I haven't given all the details so now I'm going to go back to the beginning... This is someone my boyfriend talked to online briefly and when she started saying awkward and random things he cut off communication. So going down the line, I come in to the picture and she's kept tabs on him. Well, she's clearly upset that he didn't end up with her and is now with me. To be honest, the way she attacks anyone about anything it seems this is more just an obsession in general with all our lives than really it is with him. What may have started with him has grown to much more in her mind. So now you're thinking why don't I just delete social media all together? Ahh but I have, I've deleted all my social media and now she's posting things on a daily basis tagging our friends, family, and even our work places. To make matters worse, she's tagging my boyfriend's ex girlfriend and ex wife. Even better right? Dealing with an obsessed woman isn't enough, we need his ex's in the picture too. So here we are, off social media and it isn't stopping. The most recent attack on twitter shows she is impersonating me and his ex-girlfriend and has tagged both our work, colleagues, and for me, some of my clients. We both have reported this to the police. In fact, my boyfriend's ex girlfriend's detective on the case she has now opened up was able to confirm a few things for us. The name she had been posting was in fact her, and she was in fact arrested and thought to be mentally ill. When she was arrested she was also deported back to the Philippines. It's at least comforting to know there is no physical threat, but it also explains why the harassment has increased as she is now in her home country, likely back in her own home with her family, and has the ability to be online whenever she wants. There are so many details to this story, so I'll leave it at this and answer anything that comes up in the thread. Right now, we just have no idea what to do. The fact that this is impacting our careers/workplace now is disgusting. This whole thing confuses me and really has opened up the question that there is very little that can be done with adult cyber stalking. This is such a prevalent issue with young children and teenagers, so no one ever really thinks it can happen to adults or that it doesn't matter as much, but it does. No form of cyber stalking or harassment to anyone of any age, race, gender, or any demographic characteristic should be tolerated. Yours truly, Frustrated and feeling hopeless"
