I admit that I have to write this provocative title. Please read the imaginative abundant investigation documents attached below. Just three years ago, there was an interrogation of the prosecution and the police, who took someone and made him international criminals. He asked for the investigation of the investigators, who were investigated in this way, but every time, all of the investigative commands were conducted by the Public Prosecutors' Office's Intelligence Service and none of them were charged with any crimes. Unless Mr. President Moon Jae-in reform the old-fashioned way, the next turn will be Mr. President Moon Jae-in. &amp;#x200B; [URL &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \++++++++++++++++++++ police investigation documents ++++++++++++++++++++ 1st round Kwak Dong-kyu Q: What is the current state of the suspect?

Answer: I mainly visit [4Chan.org](URL and I do not know exactly whether I have read, captured, downloaded, correctly captured or downloaded the posts posted on the above site. (The suspect was suspicious of Google image search in addition to 4Chan, where he investigated the definition and difference of the capture and the download.)

Nam Sang-wook Q: What capture program did you usually use? Answer: I use the capture program which is an extension of Google web browser. (The investigator asked for the name of the capture program.)

The save path is mainly saved on the desktop, and sometimes the file name is changed or not. Nam Sang-wook Q: Why am I changing the file name? Answer: If you do not normally change it, but the file name is too long or the file name contains special characters, change the file name. Nam Sang-wook Q: What do you usually name the file name? Answer: There is no reason to change the actual filename when downloading. However, if the filename is too long, it is difficult to keep it on my computer and change the filename. (The statement ""It is difficult to identify"" in the statement is written by the investigator as it is intended.) The suspect stated ""I do not change the name to make it easier to identify. Nam Sang-wook: Do you save the file name with a special name when saving?

1,cyber crime,u_JaeInMoon,Don't we do Moon Jae-in impeach protest?,1,aaur6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_JaeInMoon/comments/aaur6o/dont_we_do_moon_jaein_impeach_protest/,2018-12-30 21:04:16,"&amp;#x200B; URL Nam Sang-wook: When the above captured file is saved on the suspect computer and the time it was created isis.png (Obama threats) file will be released on July 7, 20:20 pm, usa.png The intimidation article for this article was confirmed on July 8, 2015 at 02:27. Also, the time for the obsession for Obama to be posted on the US White House website is around July 7, 20:20, and the article on the reporter is scheduled for July 8, 2012, It's possible. Serial Number / Content / Time / Time Difference 1 / Time Obama Obscene Writes to the White House / June 1, 2015. 7. 20:20 / about 1 minute 2 / The Obama intimidating text was created and saved on the suspect computer / July 20, 2015 3 / Repert Thousand Times posted on the White House / Jul. 8, 2015 / about 1 minute 4 / Time of the protest manuscript created and saved on the suspect computer / June 8, 2015 The suspect stated that he had downloaded and stored the contents posted on the Internet to the suspect computer. Did he / she read the threat on the Internet and stored it on the victim's computer as soon as it was posted on the White House? Answer: My computer is set to French time zone and [4Chan.org](URL site is US site, so there will be time error. (The suspect had misunderstood [4Chan.org](URL as a US site, according to Wikipedia, [4Chan.org](URL is a Japanese site.) Nam Sang-wook Q: The suspect laptops are set up with OS operating system in French language and the time zone is also based on Paris time. So, there is -7 hour time difference with Korea. However, when analyzing with the Encase analysis program used by the investigation agency, it is possible to clearly see the time generated and the modified time by changing the above French time zone to the domestic time zone, and thus the above generation time is the domestic time. At this time, the suspect is shown the access time of the isis.png file, and it is arbitrary. As a result, the cyber criminal investigation center on July 13, 2015 will try to access the above file. Therefore, the above access time will be indicated on July 13, 2015. In conclusion, the time that was created on the suspect computer was the Korean time. So, as in the previous question, is someone reading a post in the White House in just one minute and storing it on the suspect computer, and can this behavior be repeated twice? At this time, the FBI requests the suspect and displays the text and time information sent by the FBI. Answer: I do not know. Nam Sang-wook Q: Is it possible to do the above work in just one minute? A: It will not be possible in a minute. Nam Sang-wook Q: If the suspect thinks it is not possible, is the suspect posted? Answer: If it is possible, I think that it is impossible if it can be done by myself and it is impossible. Nam Sang - wook, who had heard the statement, was staring at him for a long time with a very questionable look. Nam Sang-wook: So the suspect is monitoring the White House intimidation posts posted by others in near real time, then checking them and storing them on the victim's computer? A: You have not monitored it in real time. There is no such ability. (Here, 'real-time monitoring' refers to reading a new article updated in real time by accessing the White House site.) Nam Sang-wook Q: What type of web browser do suspects use when accessing the Internet? A: I am using a Google Chrome browser. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Is the fact that the suspect accessed the White House website? Answer: I have never been connected. At this time, the picture file 'screencapture-www-whitehouse-gov-thank-you-1436290042624.png' attached to the White House homepage written by the suspect computer is displayed. Nam Sang-wook: If you look at the above picture file found on the suspect computer, it is the screen capture of the homepage of the US White House and it starts with ""Thank you for contacting the White House"". It is confirmed that the captured file is captured directly from the suspect computer through Capture, an extension function of the Google Chrome web browser.

Nam Sang-wook Moon: The threat pictures stored on the suspect computer were created on the suspect computer on March 6, 2015. For some reason, all the threat pictures were uploaded on July 7, Did you read it? A: It seems that all files are accessed at that time while the folder is being organized, and the access time has changed. Nam Sang-wook: Unfortunately, Obama and Reporter's threats were posted on the White House on July 7, 2015. A: I do not know that. At this time, July 27, 2015, the investigation report (for the search warrant application for), attached to the \[Foreign Foreign Ministry, the Foreign Ministry confirmed the article on the page\] is shown, Nam Sang-wook Q: In the above article, I used 'email [summer@hufs.ac.kr](mailto:summer@hufs.ac.kr)' using ip [124.197.152.111](URL on July 7, I do not know if this is the case.

Nam Sang-wook: 'isshufs@gmail.com' is listed in the s.txt file found on the suspect computer. A: I do not remember. Nam Sang-wook Moon: The e-mail address 'isshufs@gmail.com' is an email used to write a blackmail message to Obama. It is also stored in the s.txt file that the suspect is kept in. Is it listed on the site? A: When I do a search on Google, it looks like it came with me. Nam Sang-wook Q: Did you say you do not remember the previous statement? Answer: It is regretful to say that it is the reversal of the statement though it is the human being because it is a human being. (The statements of these suspects were recorded without further ado.) Since then, the suspect has been suffering from the mental pressure of a reversal of the statement until he is released from jail and jailed. Nam Sang-wook Q: Does the suspect mislead him?

I have also been suspected of having my own academic background, personal credit, and suffered mental harm from my job as a freelance worker. ""Do you have a strong dissatisfaction with foreign language classes? Answer: Yes. I have a complaint. (Although the suspect did not use the word ""strong"", the investigator Kwak Dong-kyu of the next place repeatedly replied the suspect's answer and continued to write ""strong dissatisfaction."" Although the suspect pointed out, A suspect asked for removal and dragged two lines and interrupted him.)

Answer: Yes, yes. Nam Sang-wook: Do you have evidence or statements that are favorable to the suspect? A: I will submit it later. Nam Sang-wook: Do you have any more to say?

A: I think it is wrong. Nam Sang-wook Moon: What is wrong with you? A: I did not intend to harm the US President Young-ae, and I did not intend to risk the riper Foreign Ambassador. Nam Sang-wook: Do you mean that in the case of the suspect, there was nothing wrong with you and you were unjustly arrested? Answer: Yes, yes. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Does that mean that the judge and the investigating agency are wrong? Answer: Yes, yes. Nam Sang-wook: Does the suspect mean that the evidence that the investigative agency can not trust? A: Yes, I can not trust the evidence presented by the police. Nam Sang-wook Moon: The evidence presented by the police is an objectively obtained data from cyber police officers who are experts in the computer field. A: I do not know exactly what part it is. Nam Sang-wook Q: What do you mean by not knowing exactly what part you are? A: I am not a computer expert or a forensic examiner. Nam Sang-wook Q: Is not the suspect a computer engineer? A: Digital and computer engineering are different. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Which part is different? A: The paper I wrote when I graduated is about sound, about digital signals, and computer engineering is about the computer itself. Nam Sang-wook: Did not the suspect claim to have a knowledgeable knowledge of the computer in the statement before? A: Yes, it is true. Nam Sang-wook: In conclusion, you do not trust the police evidence? Answer: There is no partial trust. Nam Sang-wook Q: Do you mean that there is another part that you can trust that the part is not trusting? Answer: ENCAEC Time-lapse analysis is reliable. (A cybercriminal investigator, a computer expert, continues to spell the ENCASE program incorrectly as ENCAEC, which is one of the reasons for the lack of confidence in the investigation.) At this time, the suspect suddenly says that he can not trust the program to analyze ENCAEC parallax. The suspect described ""trust"", but the investigator wrote that the suspect's statement was heard as gibberish. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Do you mean to trust the ENCAEC program that the evidence that analyzed the time lapse of the threatening posting presented by the police as evidence is correct? Answer: Yes, yes. Nam Sang-wook Moon: The suspect clearly said he trusted the ENCAEC program. In the previous statement, I stated that the operating system (OS) laid down in the suspect's laptop was in French time zone and that it would be possible to find out by observing the time difference. Why did you say so? Answer: I heard that the Cyber Police officer explained. (The suspect believed so because he trusted the explanation of the computer expert.) Nam Sang-wook Moon: Do not you mean that when you interpret the current suspect's statement, the suspect posted a post that intimidates President Obama? Answer: I just want to trust the cyber-forensic investigation technique. Nam Sang-wook Q: If you have confidence in cyber-forensic investigation, you should trust the evidence presented by cyber-police. Answer: I have a part that I do not understand. The first is the way Porter operates. The way PORCHAN works is, in short, a real-time posting like a daily best. The second is Google search engine exposure time. That means the post is not deleted right away, but exists on the Internet for some time. Nam Sang-wook Q: What does it mean to have confidence in cyber-investigation techniques and how to operate Pocan? Answer: I trust cyber forensic techniques, but the ENCAEC program is poor. Porter and Google also want to apply cyber-forensic investigation techniques to Porter and Google. Nam Sang-wook: So, if the objection is not clear and the ENCAEC program is objectively clear about the operation of Pocan or Google, as the suspect claims, how would you accept it? A: I will acknowledge you if you disclose the truth in a public authority. Nam Sang-wook Q: If the ENCAEC program or cybercriminals in a reputable institution has no problem with the evidence, would you say that you would admit the suspect's allegations? Answer: You are acknowledging the credible result, not the accusation. I have never written or wrote the article. Nam Sang-wook: If you have been verified by a reputable institution, would not it be the objective evidence to refute the statement even if the accused claims no? Answer: It is objective evidence that we want you to investigate enough evidence. (The above questions are typical guidance questions.) The suspect was not able to understand the above questions properly. Nam Sang-wook Moon: What was the suspect's childhood like? A: My childhood was loved by my parents, and I was surrounded by a lot of single parents who were economically more difficult than their friends, but were relatively happy. Nam Sang-wook Q: What was your home environment like? Answer: It was generally a harmonious family. Nam Sang-wook Q: How was your family? Answer: It was a good one. Nam Sang-wook Q: How was your relationship with your childhood? A: I did not have a lot of friends because I had few words, but there were about 10 really close friends. Nam Sang-wook Q: What is your relationship now? A: I have no friends at the moment. Nam Sang-wook: Why do not you have a friend? A: I moved to school often, I came to the army, and I looked for the course of my life, so my relationship became faded. So when I was young I was not in touch with my close friends. Even if my friends want to meet, I do not have anything to do, and I am avoiding it. Nam Sang-wook Q: What was your grade at school? A: When I was in elementary school, it was mediocre. To make up for what I did not do in high school, I studied really hard not to be matched with college days and motives. Nam Sang-wook Q: How did you look back on your military life? A: Military life was the worst of the worst. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Which part was the worst? A: I have made a statement before that. In addition, if you tell me what you are doing when you are discharged, it is likely that OO Sergeant is doing his worst and worst. For example, one of the motivations did not receive cold training, but I received it. That's because it was only for me. Nam Sang-wook: Why did the suspect quit his job? A: To be honest, it was hard. I wanted to study a little more and go to study abroad and live a better life. Nam Sang-wook Moon: What part was difficult? A: When I was working at KBS, I was physically struggling to work 5 or 3 shifts. Nam Sang-wook Q: Why are you not doing a job today? A: I am studying French. Nam Sang-wook: Can I study while I work? A: Because my style does not do a lot of things and I want to get results in a short time. And French is hard. Nam Sang-wook Moon: The suspect stated that he was living a secluded life in his home? Answer: Yes. There is a fact that I have stated. Nam Sang-wook Q: What is your daily routine? A: The morning hours are not fixed. My life is irregular, and I usually live with my rhythm at night time. Nam Sang-wook Q: What do you usually do at home? A: I sit in a fluffy chair and study French for about 14 to 21 hours. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Anything else? A: In my free time, I am posting political articles mainly on blogs. (The purpose is to turn my attention and turn my head off). Nam Sang-wook Q: How much time do you spend on computer during the day? A: I study on a computer, so it is time to study. Nam Sang-wook: Did the suspect live a night life before he was arrested recently? Or did you live in the morning? A: I was in the transition from an evening human to a morning human. Nam Sang-wook Moon: This is the date of the alleged suspicion, July 7, and July 8, 2015. A: I think that I was studying 50 or 50, maybe I was sleeping while drinking. Nam Sang-wook Moon: If you studied, did you use a computer? Answer: Yes. If I had studied, I would have used a computer. Nam Sang-wook Question: What is the special reason to use poisonous foreign sites in spite of the fact that there are many domestic sites such as Naver? A: As you know, Naver or the next one, Ivara, is a van (blocked) if you make a political comment or post on a site. So it's a relatively free site, such as Pocan and Google Blog Spot. Nam Sang-wook Moon: The suspect stated that he used the confiscated notebook (Lenovo) alone in the suspect? Answer: I keep using the password myself. Nam Sang-wook Q: What happens to my password? Answer: Your password is 656565. Nam Sang-wook: I am going to ask again, the suspects visit the White House website to rape the daughter of President Obama and threaten to murder President Obama and his family and then kill Ambassador Ripper. Did you actually upload it? A: There is no such thing at all. Nam Sang-wook: Do not the suspects make a false statement because of the fear that they will be seriously punished if the charges are taken? Answer: No. Nam Sang-wook Q: Is it not the wrong idea of the suspects to deny the charges of reprisals in the previous statement? (The suspects visited the lawyer Park Chul-hyun at the detention center before the investigation of the third investigation, and the lawyer informed the suspect about the sentence, and the investigator Nam Sang-wook knows the contents. can see.) Answer: No. Nam Sang-wook Moon: The time the Obama intimidation article was posted to the White House on July 7, 2015, 20:20 pm, the time of the original threat file was saved on the suspect computer, After a posting on the White House for about a minute, it was confirmed that it was captured and stored on the suspect computer, and the threat to the reporter was also posted on the White House for about one minute, I did. Is the statement still the same now? Answer: Yes. I still think it is impossible. Nam Sang-wook Q: Is not the accusation of the accused right? Answer: No. I would like you to disclose this part in digital forensic techniques. (The suspect answered ""truth"" and not ""statement"".) Nam Sang-wook Moon: Obscene texts kept on the suspect computer. The suspects claim to have downloaded the image file from [4Chan.org](URL However, the original text on the [4Chan.org](URL site is posted on the [4Chan.org](URL site. The deadline for the original sentence (for reporter) on the suspect computer is July 8, 2015, 2015. On August 8, 2015, the suspect's claim is confirmed as a false statement Does the suspect deny the charges? Answer: It is possible but not. Nam Sang-wook: Why is the suspect denying the contents of his allegations even after checking the Seoul Metropolitan Police Cybercrime investigation to clarify the contents of the allegations? Answer: As I mentioned at first, there are various possibilities. Nam Sang-wook: What do you think of the usual suspects, President Obama and Ambassador Repert? A: I am a person who wants to get a work visa in the United States. I am a political patriotic conservative. In the ROK - US alliance, President Obama and Ambassador Repert recognize the need to be protected. Nam Sang-wook: Did the suspect actually see President Obama and Ambassador Repert? A: I've never actually seen it. Nam Sang-wook Q: What do the suspects think about the United States? A: I am a country that envies the United States. Nam Sang-wook: Did the suspect have a plan to immigrate to the United States? A: First of all, I was thinking about transferring to a US college after graduating from college before I graduated from college. After graduating from college, I decided to go to immigration because it costs 60 million to 80 million won, I thought that it would be 8 \~ 10 years to collect money and go to immigration or transfer. Nam Sang-wook Moon: By the way, why did not you go? A: I'm still preparing to go now. Nam Sang-wook: I suspect the suspect is still preparing to go to the United States, but he is not actually collecting money or making any other efforts. A: In the present situation, I do not collect money because I plan to get money at home. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Although the suspect says America is a country of envy, is not it because he has dreamed of immigrating to the United States for a long time and has not been able to execute it? Answer: No. Nam Sang-wook: Did the suspect ever join a social organization? Answer: Not at all. &amp;#x200B;"

According to the judgment of the investigating agency, the evidence collected by the investigating agency, judging by the evidence, it seems that the suspect posted a threatening statement. A: I think the evidence of the investigation agency was not good and the judgment was wrong. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Then, what proof would the suspect have to give? Answer: I do not know. Nam Sang-wook: Did the suspect talk about the lawyer and the polygraph before he started the investigation? Answer: Yes. Nam Sang-wook: Do you have a willingness to take a lie detector? A: Yes, I will. I will accept anything to clarify my innocence. Nam Sang-wook Q: What is your current feelings? A: There is no rattling. (The investigator asked the suspect what it meant by ""ridiculous"" but did not record it.) Nam Sang-wook Q: Is the statement true? Answer: It is true. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Do you have any more to say? A: On page 5, it is not the intention of the ENCAEC program to be ill-advised, which means that the investigation is currently inadequate. (The investigator said that he described the suspect as ""poor."") Three times At this time, the lawyer Park Chul - hyun participates in the discussion with arbitrary participation. (At the time of the police investigation, the investigators were instructed by a messenger program installed on the computer used for cell phone and dossier to ask questions in real time with the investigators outside the investigation room. ) At this time, the suspects and lawyers will show the 7th report on July 15, 2015 (the suspect confirms the setting of the OO notebook time zone setting) Nam Sang-wook: Even if the suspect laptops are set in French time zone, if the computer analysis program Encase is converted into domestic time, the creation date of the file and the access date can all be confirmed by the national standard time. Go? Answer: Yes. I understand what the investigator explained, and I fully understand the time. At this time, July 15, 2015 investigation report (about the time posted on 4Chan site) show two pieces, and make an arbitrary answer. Nam Sang-wook Moon: I analyzed the time posted on the foreign site [4Chan.org](URL at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency's cyber criminal investigation office. When I posted the Korean time 17:13, In the end, it appears that the above site is located in the United States. The time posted on this site is printed in domestic time. Do you accept the above? Answer: Yes. I understood and acknowledged the contents that the investigator showed directly. (Not many people watch the posted time zone while writing on the Internet.) At this time, I show an investigation report (analysis of the Google Chrome browser capture function and analysis of the writing screen of the website of the US White House). Nam Sang-wook: The following five files found on the suspect's notebook are generated by capturing directly from the suspect's laptop through the Google Chrome browser, and seencapture-www-whitehouse-gov-contact-submit- comments-1432397652564.png and seencapture-www-whitehouse-gov-contact-submit-questions-and-comments-1432397921271.png files will be posted on the White House website on May 5, 2015 at 01:14 and 01:17 The 13-digit number that is displayed next to the capture file name is the same as the generation time of the generated file, and the above 13-digit number is the time information that is automatically generated when capturing from Google Chrome. The time of the capture file created on the notebook is the same as the date and time of capture, so that if the suspect is downloaded from the Internet, Seen from the above that there's time to capture capture program may be the same, there is confirmation that the suspect has written articles connected directly to the White House website, is not that a suspect directly after article creation, capture? (The investigator attached the Encase analysis screen to the dossier.) This long question is not a question asking the suspect's answer.) A: I do not know who did it. It is not me who wrote. It was not the first time to access the whitehouse. Nam Sang-wook Moon: The suspect's laptop has a password set? Answer: Yes, yes. Nam Sang-wook Q: Can not use the laptop above the suspect? Answer: Yes, yes. Nam Sang-wook Moon: By the way, how can I not only use the suspects, but I have 5 captures of the contents that I write to the white house by connecting to the white house, and the above file creation date and time The date and time when the file was created) is the same, but can I say that the suspect does not know? A: I can not remember it all individually. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Do not you remember that the suspect did not write? (Investigators tied several questions together or asked a lot of questions to ask questions, but they were forced to answer the suspect only with 'yes' or 'no'. The suspect looks at the investigator's eyes for a moment and then answers. (In this case, investigators are attacking through the description of the behavior of the suspect.) Answer: I did not. (The suspect responded only to 'yes' or' no ', depending on the investigators' enforcement.) The accused continues to write notes on A4 paper notes. (The note used by the suspect at the time of the investigation was written by Park Cheol-hyeon, the lawyer, who told the suspect that he was ""unable to carry the paper in the custody"") and each time the investigation was completed, he took the suspect's note and handed it to the investigators. Nam Sang-wook Moon: If the suspect did not do it, who did it? Answer: I do not know. Nam Sang-wook Q: So what is the origin of the above capture file?

Nam Sang-wook Q: Are you usually alone in the room above? Answer: Yes. I am alone. Nam Sang-wook Q: Why did you stop the entrance of the room with a bookcase? A: It is noisy. I moved the bookcase to the door entrance. Nam Sang-wook: Do you know that the suspect mother at the time of the seizure prevented the entrance to the room above the investigators?

Nam Sang-wook Q: Then do you hate Lim Su Kyung? ANSWER: Ms. Soo Kyung Lim is hated by the North Koreans. Nam Sang-wook Moon: So what do you think about the best site for the day? A: I think they are poor people. (The suspect thought, ""Because I can not get a job, and I live with my parents at home."") At this time, the suspect trims. (Because the suspect was unable to eat, the sperm from above rises.) Nam Sang-wook Q: Who uses the notebook? Answer: I use it. Nam Sang-wook Q: Do parents and siblings use a laptop? Answer: No. Not once. Nam Sang-wook Q: Who knows your notebook password? Answer: I know only. Nam Sang-wook Q: Why did I set a password on my laptop? Answer: I only use it for myself. Nam Sang-wook Q: What does the password mean? Answer: No meaning. (The suspect has demonstrated to the investigator that it is an easy location to press the index and stop on the keyboard.) At this time, we show the screen shot of the SuperHideIp program found on the suspect's laptop desktop to the suspect, and attach it at the end of this document. Nam Sang-wook Q: I have found a program that can hide the SuperHideIp IP on the suspect computer desktop. I analyzed the above program directly by Cybercrime, and it was easy to change my computer's IP with a mouse click. Why can I change it to U.S.IP when I connect to the internet in Korea? Why? Answer: I downloaded and installed it on the Internet. (The suspect was doing something just once after installation.) Nam Sang-wook Q: Is not it the intention to hide your IP? Answer: No. Nam Sang-wook Moon: I did not intend to hide. Why did you download it? Answer: I am interested in seeing the arrest news about IP trace, and got it downloaded. Nam Sang-wook Q: How did you find out that you have the above program? Answer: I learned from internet search. Nam Sang-wook Q: How exactly did you download it? Answer: I have downloaded the keyword ""ip change"" from Google and searched the web page, but I do not know which site I got it from. Nam Sang-wook Q: Why are you trying to hide IP? Answer: I do not know. Nam Sang-wook Q: Do you make statements that only a disadvantageous statement is ""I do not know""? A: In the news, I found that the police were arrested for tracking down the IP. (The suspect stumbled across KBS News, which reported this incident on a large television set in the Jongno police station detention center.) Nam Sang-wook Q: So, what kind of crime did you download? Answer: No. Nam Sang-wook Q: How many times have you tried this program? Answer: I installed Super Hide IP and tried it once after installation. Nam Sang-wook Q: How about running this program? Answer: It was executed with a single mouse click. I did not check whether the IP was changed, but I tried to execute it. Nam Sang-wook Q: Is it easy to change the IP? A: I think it depends on the person. Nam Sang-wook Moon: After we have run the above program, it is easy to operate with a single click of the mouse. We also say that the suspect is executed with a single mouse click on the statement. What does it mean by different people? Does it mean that clicking the mouse is difficult? Answer: It's easy to run, but I think there is a difference between people searching and finding them. To find the above IP change program, it means that no one can find and search well. Nam Sang-wook: Do the suspects ultimately have the ability to find programs that can change the IP? Answer: I accidentally found it. Nam Sang-wook Q: Anyway, you entered your keyword directly into Google search, and you actively found it? Answer: No. Nam Sang-wook Moon: In the previous statement, why did you say that you searched for a program by entering keywords directly, and now you accidentally found it accidentally? Answer: It is not a reversal of a statement. Superhideip is a coincidence that I clicked one of the tens of thousands of search results in the search result called IP change. (At this time, a police officer Kwak Dong-gyu was sitting beside Nam Sang-wook's investigator and asked him, ""Who did you coach?"" Kwak Dong-gyu, as an investigator in the first and second police investigations, I asked him with a smile, ""OO, is there something wrong with your mind?"" Why did you do that? ""But when the investigator did not go as planned, he started to press it like this. Nam Sang-wook Q: Did you spend a lot of time looking for the above program? A: I do not know that. (A suspect could not remember because there were a huge number of suspects who searched the Internet from time to time.) Nam Sang-wook Q: Do you think the suspects search ability is good? A: I do not think so. (The suspect stated ""I do not have an internet search ability certificate"". At this time, take a break for a while. (At this time, police officers from the police department gathered to discuss the next question.) (At the time of the investigation, an older investigator (Kim Jin-kwang) said to Nam Sang-wook, ""Do you have to turn on your laptop?"" Nam Sang-wook said, ""I need to turn on my laptop to run VMware."" The investigator said to Nam Sang-wook, ""Then think carefully and turn on the notebook!"" Nam Sang-wook went upstairs, and again, from the next investigation, Nam Sang-wook questioned me about the female anatomical image. I guess Nam Sang-wook went to the second floor and manipulated the laptop. Nam Sang-wook Q: I checked the information on cybercrime today with the above IP change program. Answer: It seems easy to double-click to run the program. Nam Sang-wook Q: What site did you access with the above program running and changing the IP? A: I do not remember.

Any weblock readme.jpg Explains how to block access to websites from your computer. Is it possible to keep the above files in order to access some blocked sites in Korea? A: You were not trying to connect to a blocked site. Nam Sang-wook Moon: How to Wash IP Address Above The .jpg file was created by the defendant's own editing program, right? A: I've captured and saved the results of searching for ""change my ip"" on Google. Nam Sang-wook Moon: The suspect has a lot of doubts about IP, asking him to check the IP posted on [4chan.org](URL According to recent cyber-investigation techniques, IP modulation is very easy, so you can not identify suspects with just one IP. Is not it because I suspect that the suspect has altered the IP or used other means of detouring? Answer: No. I did not know how to investigate, and I saw the arrest news through IP tracking. (The suspect did not ask for ""please confirm the IPs posted on [4chan.org](URL and asked for the IPs in the news article ""I traced the IPs."" Of course, There is a number.) Nam Sang-wook Q: There are many ways to change the IP. Answer: I do not know. Nam Sang-wook Q: What do you usually think about the United States?

At this time, the suspect had stated that Obama was a Republican in a questionnaire with two crime psychology professors, When the investigator who was observing from the outside tried to search the internet, it was different from the fact, and the police investigation asked this question the next day. A: As far as I know, Republicans. (The suspect responded to the investigator after commenting in advance that the criminal psych profiler was a question yesterday, but the statement did not record this statement.) At this time, using a smartphone search through Wikipedia, Obama will show the suspect that he is a Democrat. Nam Sang-wook: Why did you think Obama was a Republican? A: I do not know about American politics. (The suspect stated ""not interested in American politics."" The suspect, when the investigator came to the conclusion, ""presumed Obama as a Republican because the northern United States, where the liberation of black slaves began, is the base of the Republican Party."" But did not record. Nam Sang-wook Q: Is Democratic Party more progressive than Republican Party? A: I do not know that. Nam Sang-wook Q: Do not you know that you are interested in politics? A: I do not know about American politics. (The accused stated that they are ""interested only in domestic politics."") Nam Sang-wook Q: What do you think about Obama? A: I think he is respected as the first black president in the United States. Nam Sang-wook Q: Is the image of a monkey synthesized by Obama and Michel synthesized by the suspect? Answer: No. Downloaded. (I suspect the suspect downloaded the 4chan watermark below the photo.) Nam Sang-wook Q: Where did you download the above file? Answer: I downloaded it from 4chan. (I suspect that the suspect downloaded the 4chan watermark below the photo and downloaded it from 4chan, but in some cases the source was downloaded from a non-4chan location because it was downloaded from Google's search results.) Nam Sang-wook Q: What is the above picture? A: This is a picture of Obama as a monkey. Nam Sang-wook Q: Why did you download Obama's image and say that he saved it on the suspect's computer? At this time, the suspect trims. (Because the suspect was unable to eat and sickness came up inside.) Answer: I have downloaded it in order to utilize the background of the person who made the picture above as a material for writing criticism. Nam Sang-wook Q: Did you write criticism on your blog?

Answer: No. Nam Sang-wook Q: Is it fun to look at the pictures of Above Obama? Answer: Disgusting. Nam Sang-wook Moon: I told you that Obama's photographs are disgusting, but if you do not write related articles, should not you? Why did you keep it? Answer: I will use it later when I write again. (When the suspect tried to write, he kept it on his laptop because he could not find it on the internet.) Nam Sang-wook Q: What do you think about black people? A: I think that black people are the same person and call themselves black people themselves. (The suspect thought that the sword should be replaced with the word 'African American' with the word 'black', because it is a racist word.) Nam Sang-wook Moon: The suspect is very clear about the above question. What belief do you have about racism? A: Racial discrimination is an ideology by some white supremacists. This includes blacks and asians. Therefore, Koreans can also be victims of racial discrimination. Nam Sang-wook Q: Does the suspect think that I am logical and reasonable? Answer: I only believe in evidence as much as possible. Nam Sang-wook: By the way, why did you say you did not commit the crime while trusting all the results of computer digital evidence analysis? Answer: The superhidip is a bit less reliable. Nam Sang-wook Q: Even if you have a friendly feel for the US in general, can you think of it as bad for Obama?

Nam Sang-wook Q: What does it mean to be pessimistic? A: I know Nietzsche is pitiful.

(The parents of the suspect and lawyer Park Chul-hyeon said, ""The traces of the hacking were found on the suspect's notebook and should be stated in the police investigation."" However, the police spread the statement to the press and said, ""The suspect is a third- (KCNP News, Internet News Article), ""and said,"" It is the people who say that our house cat is the key to the keyboard ""I was tortured and blamed for everything I had never experienced before."" Nam Sang-wook Q: What hacking program do you mean? A: I do not know that either. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Have you ever been hacked? Answer: I have never been hacked. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Although the suspect clearly remembered his activities during his military service and his posting on the Blue House and the National People's Magazine last year, he continued to lie about the fact that he did not remember his post on the White House site What is it? A: I never lied. (The investigator responded briefly to each case when the suspect responded.) The suspect responded to the complaint posted in the Blue House and the National Census Bureau by postal mail from the person in charge and kept the post and reply to the post I remember because I had saved it on my blog, and the suspect consistently said ""I did not post it"" about whether or not to post the blackmail in the White House, and did not say ""I do not remember."" Nam Sang-wook Q: Does the suspect usually lie well? A: I can not lie. Nam Sang-wook Moon: I do not recall an important important question. What do you think about the fact that the investigator seems to admit that he posted the article? Answer: I did not remember, so I made the statement as above. Nam Sang-wook Moon: If I do not remember, can I drink and not remember? Answer: Not. I think there are multiple factors. Nam Sang-wook: You may not remember a lot of alcohol at the time of the crime? A: I did not have to break the film because I drank a lot of alcohol. Nam Sang-wook Moon: At the time of the seizure search, I drank a lot of alcohol and stated earlier that I remember faintly. Then you can not remember it because you drank a lot of alcohol at the time of the crime? At this time, the suspect shakes his head and thinks for a moment. (""I can not remember"" is not the word ""I do not remember."") The guiding question of the investigator was not logical, so the look of the accused was not understood by the guilty pleasures of lying, I did it.) Answer: I do not know. Nam Sang-wook Q: What do you think about the fact that the suspect is being denied even though the evidence is clearly revealed by the computer analysis program Encase? Is it a reasonable answer to state that you do not remember well? A: I do not know because people are beyond their abilities. (The accused stated earlier that ""the access time analysis results of SuperHideIp are different from the truth and the credibility of the Encase program is poor."") Nam Sang-wook Q: How did you keep all two of them on the suspect computer, not one of them? What do you think of that? Answer: I guess that the two intimidation posts are not considered to be much difference, it is estimated to have been uploaded continuously. Nam Sang-wook Moon: The Obama intimidation article is about 6 hours difference on July 7, 2015, about 7:20 pm, and Repert's intimidation article is about 7.8 02:26. Is it? Answer: I was wrong. (The suspect believes that two blackmails may have appeared in the same search result at the same time.) Nam Sang-wook Q: What is your relationship with your parents? A: I have a good relationship with my parents. Nam Sang-wook Q: Did your father train hard? Answer: It was not severe. (The suspect responded with a lawyer, Kim Yong-min, ""I played with my father and BB gun at a young age."") Nam Sang-wook Q: What is your father's job? A: I was a teacher, but I retired this year. Nam Sang-wook Q: Have you ever been beaten by a father when you were a child? Answer: It is number 1 and nothing else. (The suspect responded to the investigator ""I was hit one time."") Nam Sang-wook Moon: Are you sure? Answer: Ask your father. Nam Sang-wook Q: Do you depend on your parents for everything? A: I do not depend on you. Nam Sang-wook Moon: In the case of seizure search and emergency arrest, the accused lie down in the room with only panties, and an investigator in Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency explains about two or three hours to arrest her father and mother dozens of times, In case of an emergency arrest, the suspect said, ""What does your father say? Did your father agree to an emergency arrest? "" Answer: Yes, yes. Nam Sang-wook Moon: If my father was arrested urgently and the police officers told me to go away, was he going to go on his own? A: If my father told me to go, he would not have responded. (The police claim that the suspect had been drunk and had a crush on him, but the suspect said he tried to arrest the police officers without revealing that they were police officers, and that he resisted knowing that they were bullets. The family of suspects filed a complaint with the Human Rights Commission that the police had violated human rights during the search and arrest of the police, but both the inspection office and the NHRCK I was ignored.) Nam Sang-wook Moon: You have to judge yourself. Why did you ask your father about it? A: I was scared because I had more than 30 people in the situation. (The suspect lied on the bed and felt frightened when he covered the bed.) Nam Sang-wook Moon: At that time, 9 to 10 people went to the suspect, and the suspect was lying for four hours at the time of the search. Answer: I also had a hangover, and it was annoying to be honest. Kim Kyung - hwan, a cyber investigator who participated in the emergency arrest, said to the accused who was lying in bed, ""Because of you, 10,000 people suffered from a night spent for a week. Nam Sang-wook Moon: But when my father says he does not agree, the suspect kept lying in bed? Answer: Yes, yes. Nam Sang-wook: Can the suspect be able to do it alone without the will of his parents? A: I do not know for sure, but I think it is natural to ask for help if you get caught up in a crisis situation. (Here 'help' means 'family help.') Nam Sang-wook Moon: The suspect brother is living alone as a self-employed person, right? A: I'm working in Ansan. Nam Sang-wook: Why is the suspect unable to live independently like his brother? A: I spent two years in college, but I have difficulty getting along with my parents. Nam Sang-wook Moon: What part was difficult? Answer: It was hard to eat food. Nam Sang-wook: Do you have any reason to tell the suspect when your father visits the jongno police station, ""Do not succumb to the police's remorse."" (Based on the fact that the investigator had eavesdropped on the suspect. A: I will not answer the above questions. (The suspect stated, ""I will not reply to the fact that I have been tapped."" The questioner, Nam Sang-wook, of the Cyber Investigation Team who answered these answers was quite puzzled and omitted the ""tapped facts"". Nam Sang-wook Q: Does the suspect have his father's instructions unconditionally? Answer: Half. Sometimes it is unconditional and sometimes not. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Suspect What is your current age? A: OO year old Korea is 34 years old. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Do you have a separate computer for your father? Answer: Yes. There is a separate computer. Nam Sang-wook Q: Do you work with your dad computer a lot? A: I do not know that. (The suspect stated ""My father hates my father so much that I do not use it often"", but I did not record it in the dossier.) Nam Sang-wook Moon: All the evidence is clear, and a warrant for seizure of the suspect's residence was issued by the judge, and the emergency arrest was approved by the prosecutor. The suspect was given the opportunity to conduct an actual arrest warrant, What is the reason why I do not remember the suspect himself? A: I do not think so. (The investigator provided false information in order to pressure the suspect, the suspect read the documents presented by the police officer of the police investigation about the reasons for the arrest warrant issued by the judge at the detention center after the probation officer or the detention warrant, The suspect already knew that the judge had been convicted and did not issue because of all the evidence that was evident because of the concerns of escape and evidence of extinction. Nam Sang-wook Question: Who gave the answer to the above? A: I have never been influenced by external influences. Nam Sang-wook: Do not you think your actions are wrong? (The investigator suddenly questioned the judge. A: I certainly did not post it. Nam Sang-wook: Even now, I would like my parents to tell me the truth about what I have done, to seek good fortune and to live hard. What do you think of the suspect? A: I do not think I should cover the truth. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Anyone can make mistakes, do not you think you can correct mistakes? A: I can not make mistakes because I did not make mistakes. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Looking at the s.txt file found on the suspect's notebook, the text file says, ""I'm going to kill the Ambassador Repert by penetrating the US Embassy. Obama kidnapped my little daughter and I will rape my anus. ""Why did you list the above? A: I do not know the keyword on the internet Google but I check the phrase on the website that I have searched for and copy it to s.txt. I copied and pasted it to a file. (The suspect did not know exactly where the Web site was located.) The investigator kept a record of the suspect's response long without a comma in the record, making it look like an excuse, and the meaning changed depending on where the reader was resting. Nam Sang-wook: Did not you post Obama and Repert's intimidating articles in the White House by referring to the threats listed in the above s.txt? Answer: No. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Looking at the above s.txt file, two emails used in blackmail, [isshufs@gmail.com](mailto:isshufs@gmail.com), Office of International Summer Session in Korean &amp; East Asian Studies 107, Imun-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, Korea, 130-791 Posted by Lifee Iss Crazzyy, Address Office of International Summer Session in Korean &amp; East Asian Studies 107, Imun-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, Korea, 130-791, Tel + 82-2-2173-2062 , Twitter [URL The address is listed, was not it planned for the crime? Answer: No. It came with copying and pasting. Nam Sang-wook Q: In addition, the above text file contains an e-mail [isshufs@naver.com](mailto:isshufs@naver.com) which is not used for the crime, and the above e-mail address is not also posted on [4chan.org](URL How is this e-mail address listed? A: I do not know. Nam Sang-wook Moon: The intimidation is not written in Korean, but is it a Korean word? Answer: It is taken from the Internet and copied. (The suspect stated ""I copied and pasted it."" Nam Sang-wook Moon: And look at the s.txt file. Address, email, phone, fax number is "" \- Address: Office of International Summer Session in Korean &amp; East Asian Studies 107, Imun-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, Korea, 130-791 \- Website: [URL \- Phone: + 82-2-2173-2062 \- Fax: + 82-2-2173-2877 \- E-mail: [summer@hufs.ac.kr](mailto:summer@hufs.ac.kr) / [isshufs@gmail.com](mailto:isshufs@gmail.com) ""Format. The above format is not listed in the blackmail, is it listed in the above text file in the above format? A: It's all copied from the Internet. (The suspect stated ""I copied and pasted it."" Nam Sang-wook Q: Why was the fax number listed even though the fax number was not used in the crime? Answer: I do not know. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Foreign language site You could access the summer school site [URL and get the phone number, fax, e-mail and save it in the above s.txt file? Answer: Not. Nam Sang-wook Moon: The suspect has an antipathy to the outsider who is usually his alma mater. Answer: No. Nam Sang-wook Q: Is the Twitter address [URL imported? Answer: It came from Google search on the internet. (The suspect stated that they ""came together when copying and pasting."" Same as the answer on page 585.) Nam Sang-wook Q: How did you search on Google? A: I do not remember the search term. Nam Sang-wook: Do you usually follow IS? A: I will not follow. Nam Sang-wook Q: Did you find IS-related pictures on the suspect computer? Answer: Yes, yes. Nam Sang-wook Moon: And you synthesized the above IS-related pictures and edited the picture to be the same by marking the Hwarangdo and IS in Korea equally with '=' symbol? Answer: Yes, yes. Nam Sang-wook Q: Do you have an interest in IS? A: I just got to know the news, but I have no interest. (The suspect stated ""I do not follow IS."") Nam Sang-wook Q: Is there any fact that the suspect visited the foreign site [URL Answer: No. At this time, we show computer analysis program Encase analysis screen directly to the suspect. At this time, the attorney also looks at the above analysis program screen. (At this time, the investigator changed to cyber investigator Kim Kyung - hwan, wearing black - eyed spectacles at. Kim Kyung-hwan Moon: Suspect Computer What is 'bureau' in French at the bottom of my document? Answer: This is a term for desktop. The suspect was surrounded by police officers who had been excited for a long time and was subjected to a coercion investigation that he had seen during the military torture film during the military regime of the 1980s. The list of filenames listed shows one by one from the top and goes down one by one. ""What is this?"" When the suspect did not know, Kim Kyung-hwan cried out loudly, ""Why do not you know?"" 4 to 5 investigators came into the interrogation room and asked for a high intensity. At this time, I stopped the investigation for dinner. (The police arrested Park Cheol-hyun, the suspect, and only two people for dinner for a long time.) The lawyer Park Cheol-hyeon repeated the word ""confess"" to the suspect while eating the two lunch boxes, In the conversation police intercepted, the suspect questioned the blood type of Park Cheol-hyun and answered that he was AB-type, and asked whether he married Park Cheol-hyun's wife because he was pregnant at the time, It was all the congratulations.) At this time, five pieces of the text file s.txt link file (A0065358.lnk, A0065518.lnk, A0065541.lnk, A0065621.lnk) found on the suspect computer are shown to the suspect and attached at the end of this document. Nam Sang-wook: 7. 20. As described in the 4th meeting, the link file (lnk) is automatically generated when a certain file is executed in the Windows operating system, for example, when viewing the above text file. File and analyze the lnk file to see which file you have opened. The link file creation date and time is the date when the first file is executed, and if you repeatedly execute the same file, the accessed time of the link file changes. The above five link files are link files that are automatically generated by running the s.txt file on the suspect computer. Checking the creation date and the modified date and time (Accessed time) 1) A0065358.lnk 2014. 9. 10. 16:59 (date and time of creation), 2015 7. 7. 14:57 (date and time of access) 2) A0065518.lnk 2014. 9. 10. 16:59 (date and time of creation), July 7, 2015 (date and time of access) 3) A0065541.lnk 2014. 9. 10. 16:59 (date and time of creation), July 7, 2015 (date and time of access) 4) A0065621.lnk 2014. 9. 10. 16:59 (date and time of creation), July 7, 2015 (date and time of access) And the Obama intimidation article is posted on the White House on July 7, 2015, and the Repert's intimidation article is on July 7, 2015, I read the s.txt file which is written in Hangul on the contents of the intimidation article and write the crime article in the White House on July 7, 2015, I read the file three times on July 7, 21:10, 21:19, and 22:31, and posted a blackmail message about Ripper on July 8, 02:26? A: I do not know. At this time, the link file (A0065569.lnk, A0065481.lnk) found on the suspect computer is shown and attached at the end of the document. Nam Sang-wook Q: When I look at the above link file, A0065569.lnk is castration.png file created by browsing on June 7, 2015, and when I check the above picture file, A0065481.lnk is a file created by browsing hufs.png on July 7, 2015. If you check the above picture file, it is a picture of the screen where the foreign language group is searched by Google and the picture of Lim Su Kyung. Have you ever read the above two files in the above list? A: I do not remember the exact time, but I remember reading two photo files above. Nam Sang-wook Moon: I read about the picture file (hufs.png) on July 7, 2015, and the link file A0065481.lnk was created. The suspect stated that the above picture had memories of reading, and about 50 Minute after s.txt. I have browsed the file and found the link file (A0065358.lnk). Do you remember reading the s.txt file on July 7, 14:57? A: I do not remember reading. (The suspect stated ""I do not remember the exact time."") Nam Sang-wook Question: 7. 7. I have read the s.txt file containing the contents of Hangul at four times in total. Have you ever seen a file? A: I do not know that. Nam Sang-wook Q: When was the last time you read the s.txt file? A: I do not remember the last time. Nam Sang-wook Q: Why do you keep denying the crime of reading the text document s.txt, which contains the contents of the Korean text on the intimidation article, four times before the crime was committed? A: I do not remember whether I read it four times. (The suspect stated ""I do not remember the exact number of times."") Nam Sang-wook: I read the blackmail in Korean 4 times before the crime, and the blackmail was posted in the White House since then. Answer: There is no plan. (The suspect stated ""I have never posted a blackmail"".) Nam Sang-wook Q: How is your heart? A: There is no rattling like in the fourth survey. Nam Sang-wook Q: Is the suspect harmed? Answer: It is unfair. I would like the police to investigate the matter. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Lastly I'll ask. Do you really have access to the White House homepage? Answer: There is no connection. Nam Sang-wook: Do you have evidence or statements that are favorable to the suspect? Answer: No. (The suspect stated in the sense of ""I can not submit favorable evidence or statements in the present state of detention."") Nam Sang-wook Q: Do you have anything more to say? Answer: On page 3, ""Please ask the police officer to rub your shoulder"" is your blood pressure. On page 28, the cruel photographs are downloaded habitually and I regret that I am curious. For the sake of misleading explanation, the child's naked photographs were downloaded from Nudists (naturalists), and the pictures of the baby's penis were cut off to make an essay criticizing the forced ceremony in Indonesia. It was. And I remember that the pictures with the knife in the child's boat are satirical images of the terrorist forces in the Islamic language, and the models in the photographs are pictures taken only by 18 years of age or older. Also, the pictures of blood in the female vagina were to criticize the girl 's forced circumcision tradition, and the picture of the bowel movement on the Taegukgi was to blame the blasphemy of the national flag. In addition, it was to expose the facts of illegal organs extraction and Kim Jung Eun regime. I wish you good judgment. &amp;#x200B;"

A: I'm willing to take a lie detector test. Thank you. I received a request from the police investigation stage. (At the time of the police investigation, the suspect and Park Cheol-hyeon lawyer, only two people remain in the investigation room, Park Chul-hyun told the suspect, ""You can get a lie detector test."" After the investigation began, The suspect was asked to check the police's lie detector, and when the suspect made the handwritten statement at the prosecution's investigation, he used the expression ""requested"" ""I refused,"" the suspect said, ""I received a request from the police, but I will not fix it because I am not asking."") Finally, I think my blog post is wrong. (At the conclusion of all the blog posts of the suspect, the paragraph begins with ""I hope my thoughts are wrong anyway ..."" which emphasizes a neutral position on the topic.) Jung Guk Q: Are there any items that are not listed or different from the facts as stated in the memorandum? Answer: No. (The prosecutor investigated slowly when he started the investigation, but when the suspect became tired at the end, he launched a question.) Three times In the middle of the summer, the suspect was seated in a chair by a prosecutor, and after seeing his lawyer Park, he asked him to ""float the water."" Park Chul-hyun refused, ""I want you to eat it,"" and the suspect obtained the permission of the prosecutor's office and drank water. Park Cheol-hyeon came to the police station with a Mercedes Benz car and asked him more importantly about the location of the parking lot at the first meeting with the investigators. Park Cheol-hyun, who asked me to hand him over to the suspect's parents because he would not receive a bargaining fee of 3 million won, came in well, but in front of the suspect under investigation, The prosecutor's office was changed to a regular inspection. Jung Moon-sik Moon: (A regular checkup shows the analysis result and the isis.png picture file printed on A4 paper and tells the suspect, ""I am sorry that the picture is small."" And to exert pressure on the suspect, I gave up the two files.) \[Present the above isis.png file and analysis result (isis.png\_REPORT.txt) from the suspect's notebook.\] The above file came out of the suspect notebook. Have you ever seen it? Answer: I saved this file on my notebook. I searched this file on the internet, downloaded it and saved it on my laptop. I did a Google search. The source of this file from Google search results was not verified. At the time, I do not remember what I put my search terms into while doing a Google search. At that time, I do not remember what kind of search I was doing specifically. The file contains the phrase ""I am going to anal rape your second daughter Natasha."" However, I think you'll need to know how I searched for the file with that content. (The official testimony showed the intimidation to the suspect, and then recorded in the record, 'I am going to anal rape your second daughter Natasha.' Jung Moon-sik Q: When did you download the above file? Answer: It seems to have been downloaded from the middle of June 2015 until the day of my confiscation (May 13, 2015). Jung Moon-sik Statement: As a result of the above file analysis, the above file was created on July 7, 20:21. Is the suspect downloaded on the date above? Answer: (At this time, the suspect nods his head.) Yes, I had downloaded one time and remembered that it was downloaded in July, so I downloaded it on July 7, 20:21, (The suspect stated that he was studying French at 50:50 on the 7-8th day, or taking a sleep, but he recorded what the attorney understood.) Jung Moon-sik Moon: (A regular checkup shows the analysis results and the usa.png picture file printed on A4 paper and tells the suspect, ""I am sorry that the picture is small."" And to exert pressure on the suspect, (The file was found on the suspect's notebook.) The above file was presented on the suspect's notebook. Have you ever seen it? Answer: Yes, I have seen this file. I downloaded it through internet search and saved it on my laptop. I searched on Google. I do not remember which search terms I entered into Google, and I can not remember which sites I downloaded from Google search results. I do not remember the exact date and time when I searched for this file. I did not remember why I searched this file, and I searched for no reason. I do not remember entering the White House as my search term. I seem to have downloaded and saved this file at once with a file (isis.png file) containing the phrase 'I am going to anal rape your second daughter Natasha.' Jung Moon-sik Statement: As a result of the above file analysis, the above file was created on July 8, 2015 at 02:27. Is the suspect downloaded on the date above? A: I remember downloading this file (usa.png file) in July 2015. However, I do not remember exactly whether I downloaded it on July 8, 2015. Jung Moon-sik Moon: (The official test shows the file attribute picture file and the picture file of this file to the suspect who printed it on the A4 paper screencapture-www-whitehouse-gov-thank-you-1436290042624.png "" I had to copy this file to the computer on my computer, so the location of the file attribute would say ""check"", and I put on a stapler with an exaggerated gesture to pressurize the suspect. ) \[The above screencapture-www-whitehouse-gov-thank-you-1436290042624.png file from the suspect's notebook and presenting the file property output\] The above file came from the suspect's notebook. Have you ever seen it? Answer: I searched this file on the Internet, downloaded it and saved it on my laptop. I did a Google search. The source of this file, which comes from Google search results, is hard to remember. It's hard to remember what you put your search terms into while doing a Google search. I did not search for a specific purpose. Jung Moon-sik Q: When did you download the above file? A: I can not remember the exact date. It seems to have been downloaded from the middle of June, 2015 to the beginning of July, 2015. Jung Moon-sik Statement: As a result of the above file analysis, the above file appears to have been generated on July 8, 2015. Is the suspect downloaded on the date above? A: I do not remember the exact date, but it is between mid-June and mid-July 2015. Jung Moon-sik Moon: (Record 674 pages photo file) Above castration.png What is photo file? Answer: The above castration.png file is a picture file I downloaded. I remember that I was downloaded from mid-June to 2015. 7. Cops. Castration means 'castration'. The above file is a scene of a movie. I can not remember being a movie with a lot of content. I guess I did not put the word ""castration"" into my query. Because it's about Google search results, I'm beyond the scope of what I'm describing. Jung Moon-sik Moon: (Record 675, 677, Representative Lim Seong-Kyung) What are the photo files? Answer: I searched for photos of Mr. Soo - kyung who showed me to use as a resource for criticism. I received a Google search and download. It is to criticize the main North Korean government. I store criticisms in my diary-style personal blog. I can not remember the exact date when I downloaded these files. In the material shown, the date and time of creation of these files is July 7, 2015. I think that the reason why the file creation date and time is analyzed as above dates is beyond the range that I can answer. I posted an article about Lim Soo Kyung in my blog ([antihufs.blogspot.kr](URL on July 7, 2015, and the above pictures are included in the article. That blog is still open. (It was impossible to remember all three or four thousand articles written by suspects.) At first, the suspect did not know what was on this blog. When the suspect said, ""It was between the middle of June and the beginning of July,"" the lawyer Park Chul-hyeon said, ""Why do you lie to the suspect? ? ""), And showed the date of the suspect's blog on his cell phone. The suspect responded that he saw his cell phone and posted it on July 7, 2015.) Jung Moon-sik: Does the suspect use a router when using a laptop? Answer: I have never written a program to change Internet IP, but I use a router. I purchased an internet router for 12,000 won ten years ago. Again, I can not remember exactly when I bought it. I have a router in my house, and I have 3 computers (my laptop, my desktop, my dad, and my computer are using that router). I use the router every time I use the internet. I have not changed my Router setting since I have never used it, but I have not changed my Router setting any more. When I use my Router, I enter ID (ADMIN) and Password (494) in the Router. I have not touched the case of the suspect. Jung Moon-sik Moon: Is there anything the suspect wants in the prosecution investigation process? A: Now that I have sealed my laptop, I did not break it. It is difficult to tell which part I should investigate because I am not an expert. (The prosecution extended the detention period of the suspects by 10 days in the name of investigating notebook hacks.) Jung Moon-sik Moon: Do you have any more to say? Answer: No. Jung Moon-sik Q: Are there any items that are not listed or different from the facts as stated in the memorandum? Answer: (handwritten entry) None. Four times At this time, the defendant is attending lawyer Park Cheol-hyeon attorney, saying that he will be investigated under the participation of counsel. Toward the suspect, (The official examination did not participate in the interrogation of the suspect, but did not record it in the prosecution dossier.) Jung Guk Q: Has the suspect ever stated the truth before? Answer: Yes. I have stated the truth. It's what I said. Jung Guk Moon: The suspect described last time that he used the mobile phone of the suspect's mojo OO. Does he remember the cell phone number used by the suspect? Answer: I used a number other than 5787 from my mother's cell phone number. Jung Guk Moon: The suspect is Mo-Kim OO's cell phone number is 010-2359-8775, 010-3687-5787. If the suspect has not used 010-3687-5787, the remaining 010-2359-8775 is used Is that right? Answer: It's true that I used my mother's cell phone, but I can not remember the cell phone number I used. Jung Guk Moon: How long did the suspect use the cell phone (010-2359-8775) of Mo Kim OO?

At 20:20, the obsession for President Obama was posted on the White House, and on the same day 14:57 on the same day, there were traces of reading the s.txt file in Korean, : 20) 1 minute after 20:21, capturing of threats (isis.png) is confirmed on the computer of the suspect, and the above s.txt file is read twice (ahead of 21:10 and 21:19) The suspect said, ""I just scanned the computer and copied it to a text file, and I do not know whether it was scanned or not."" How is it? Answer: Yes. It is correct as I stated before. Jung Guk Moon: The suspect is on July 7, 2015, 20:20, 20:20. Is it the correct time to copy the text from the suspect computer and paste it into a text file? Answer: I do not know the exact time. It is correct that I copied and pasted the results from Internet search. At this time, the defendant responded by saying, ""Let's rest for about 10 minutes and proceed with the investigation again."" After taking a rest for 10 minutes (15:05), the defendant's lawyer sits again next to the suspect : 17). (Attorney Park Cheol-hyeon asked the prosecutor ""Let's take a break because I have to deliver the papers to another client."") Jung Moon-sik Moon: The suspect is posted on the White House website on June 7, 2015, about the Ambassador Repertory. One minute later, at about 02:27, The file was created on the suspect computer. Is the time at which the suspect was copied from the suspect computer through Internet search and pasted to the text file? Answer: The exact time zone is ... (At this time the suspect closed his eyes and thought for a while) ... It's a little hard to remember. It is correct that I copied and pasted the results from Internet search. (The prosecution officer exaggerated that the suspect thought for a while, through the depiction of the act of aggression. Jung Moon-sik Q: How about a detailed explanation of how the suspect copied and pasted the results of Internet search? A: I went into the internet and searched, but the search terms were hard to remember and I copied the search results and pasted them into a text file. Jung Moon-sik Q: How do I get the search result when I can not remember the search term? Answer: ... It's a bit difficult to identify the exact query. (The suspect searches a large number of search terms to find search results just like ordinary people, remembering only the search results, and not remembering what search terms you searched for.) Jung Moon-sik Moon: The suspects are [URL [jeolladian.blogspot.com](URL [jeolladian.blogspot.com](URL [helkorea.blogspot.com](URL [helpkorea.blogspot.com](URL [bosulachi.blogspot.com](URL [antihufs.blogspot.com](URL [antihufs.blogspot.com](URL [avstats.avira.com](URL Do you know these sites? A: Of the above sites, [URL [avstats.avira.co](URL is an unknown site, [jeolladian.blogspot.com](URL [jeolladian.blogspot.com](URL [helkorea.blogspot.com](URL [helpkorea.blogspot.com](URL [bosulachi.blogspot.com](URL , [antihufs.blogspot.com](URL [antihufs.blogspot.com](URL are my blogs. Bosulachi is an Internet language that refers to a woman whose conduct is the subject of social criticism. Jung Moon-sik Moon: The suspects access the above sites on July 7th and 8th, 2015, and the hackers are running the suspects' [jeolladian.blogspot.com](URL [jeolladian.blogspot.com](URL [helkorea.blogspot.com](URL helpkorea. Do you know how many URLs you know, such as [blogspot.kr](URL [bosulachi.blogspot.com](URL [antihufs.blogspot.com](URL [antihufs.blogspot.com](URL A: I'm not sure, but I do not have access to all of the above. (The suspect opened multiple blogs with one Google mail account.) I insisted on 'Google Cache', and my parents and lawyers claimed that my laptop might have been hacked at this time. (Attorney Park Cheol-hyun who heard this statement stared at the suspect for a while without saying anything.) Jung Moon-sik Question: Why did you tell the log records that you have access to the above sites on July 7th and 8th, 2015, and that you have not accessed all of the above? A: I do not remember what I did at the time. (The suspect has not been able to access all of the blogs because he did not manage them by creating multiple blogs. Jung Moon-sik Moon: When the prosecution re-imaged the suspect's laptop, Jung Moon-sik said, ""I did not have Hangul input function on the laptop used by the suspect, but I entered Hangul using Internet input device. How do I input / output Hangul? (When imaging at the Cyber Office of the Public Prosecutors' Office, Cyber Investigator of the Chief Prosecutor's Office showed the process of analyzing the laptop to the suspect. A: Find the site that comes up with 'Hangul input device' on Google and click on the search result to input Hangul using the keyboard. There is a Korean keyboard on the notebook I bought and confiscated. The alphabet and Korean are shown on the keyboard. I used a French version of Windows XP on the laptop. I have installed a French version of Windows to enter French special characters. (The official testified, ""Why do you write it?"") And the suspect stated ""I bought the cheap laptop because I was unemployed, I wrote it with inconvenience."" But I did not record it in the record. However, the prosecution cyber investigator estimates it to be between two and three million won, ""from the beginning,"" the laptop's hard disk capacity is quite large. "" Jung Moon-sik Q: How do you describe the process of entering Korean into Google in detail? Answer: First, enter Google ([URL into the Internet address bar, and when the Google window appears, enter the Korean input device (gksrmfdlqfurrl) in English into the search box. Then, the Korean input method site appears in order, and from the top of the Korean input method site, click downward to find a site where you can input Korean. If you find a Hangul input site, you can input Hangul by using computer keyboard and then copy the Hangul input and paste it in the place where Hangul input is needed. (The suspect's laptop is in French, so typing [URL leads to [URL Even if you search for both sites with the same search terms, the order of the search results displayed is different.) Jung Moon-sik Moon: As a result of the prosecution's hacking test on the suspect's laptop, there are no signs of specially remote control (especially July 7, 2015, and July 8, 2015). How about this? And the suspect did not delete the access log from the laptop router? Answer: (The suspect does not answer the hacking test result.) I just entered the ID and password on the router, and I do not remember when I entered it. I did not delete the Router Access Log on June 25, 2015, June 7, 2015, and July 8, 2015. \++++++++++++++++++++ Forensic Investigation for Brother 6666 Case 2015 Verification Statement ++++++++++++++++++ ++ Author: In-Sung Kim, Professor, 010-5270-5779, No. 819-5, Bangbae-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul, (On January 19, 2016, Kim Yong-Min attorney handed in the opinion of professor Kim In-Sung) 1. Whether hacking outside No external hacking traces were found. 2. The legitimacy of the forensic process There was no expert to judge the legitimacy of forensic work in the seizure process. 3.

The date of file creation in the report is considered to be the date of creation of the report, which is the author of the report. 6. If the hash value of the hard disk imaging file is different It is judged that the hash value has changed because reimaging was performed after rebooting the computer to check the time zone after imaging in the seizure search process. 7. White House screen capture file The White House screen capture file is captured and stored on this computer. This statement is a review of the evidence only and is not a definitive opinion and may be subject to change if additional evidence is available. 2015.12.29 Kim In Sung.

Whether to change the router MAC address The router MAC address can be changed and there is a trace of change. Router Shows the log when changing the MAC address, but it has the function to prevent the log setting from being saved in the router setting. It is difficult to say that the MAC address associated with the IP address assigned by the vendor is found on the router, and that the MAC address is not used because the change log is not left on the router. \-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- hole!

Whether the 7.21 date file exists, 7.21 Date The created file does not exist. There is no file that matches the creation date of the file specified in the report. The creation date of the file, such as the name of the file submitted as evidence in the report, is prior to the seizure. The s.txt file submitted as evidence in the report matches the file creation date recorded in the hard disk imaging data. The date of file creation on the report except s.txt is determined as the date of the report creation. Therefore, it is a mistake of the report author to make the file creation date as 7.21. \-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- Fruit: F: \\ 15, Terrorist, with a lot of light, 653, txt \_Z0l5-07-21, 9 \^ 7? 06; 30 AG public.  53 ts 6,1 nJt and public [hOO65356.Ink](URL ti 1?

The letter was posted on the White House website of the US Embassy. We contacted the cyber security office of the US through the US Embassy. I started to investigate immediately. Q: Where exactly did you receive the investigation leads? A: The National Police Agency Cyber Safety Bureau. Q: Is not it from the US? A: I know you are an American Embassy.

In this case, the date of publication of the ""Obituary rape against the second daughter of US President Obama"" is based on EDT (American Summer Time) applied on July 7, 2015 July 20, 2015) and the connection IP was confirmed as [124.197.152.74](URL Answer: Yes. In this case, ""Mark Ripper,"" the publication date of the murder intimidation article 1 for US Ambassador to Korea, is based on EDT (Eastern Time) 7. 8. 02:26), and the connection IP was confirmed as [124.197.152.48](URL Answer: Yes. Q: How did you check each posting date and connection IP above? A: I also logged on to the White House homepage, and I received it from the police and handed it to us. Q: Please describe the reason why the defendant was identified as the suspect of each crime in this case. Answer: Once there was no clue except for the connection IP, I received a reply that I could not confirm the subscriber because I requested the subscriber information on Dongdaemun Cable TV Road TV with that IP. So, when we check the area where we can get the IP to check the subscribers, we can not remember exactly in Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul. We have heard that there is a possibility that it can be allocated from about 2, 500 households, and when we check the MAC address on the computer, we can find the investigation lead to the MAC address. I checked to the closest apartment complex I was assigned. When I narrowed it down, it was O apartment where I can check it, it was the defendant's apartment. I do not know how many apartments there are in the apartment, but if there are 20 floors, it is 20th floor because there are 20th floor and 20th floor. I have only recruited subscribers to Dongdaemun cable TV from 20th generation. I do not remember exactly, but it has been reduced to about 5 \~ 6 generations, and I had to look through 5 \~ 6 generations and I could not do that. I analyzed the crime trends and impersonated isis. I also impersonated the Korean foreign affairs staff from the phone number and e - mail address of the Korea Foreign Student Summer School. So a team of our investigation team was sent out to the outside world to check if there really is such a person, and there is no such thing there is a person who has a bad tendency to the outside world is not an optical investigation, I confirmed the propensity of. And there are two criminal intimidation articles: the first is the daughter 's intimidation to President Obama and the second is the intimidation to Ambassador Ripper that the second daughter of Obama, Natasha, is raped by anus. This can be seen as a bit of a kinky tendency of the writer, and the second is to threaten Ambassador Repert, whose weapon is called a nuclear weapon. I found a tendency that I could not imagine in a mental state, which is a little impolite. I checked the apartment tenant management card because I thought it was very likely to be an outside official in O apartment. So I think that the defendant goes to a foreign language university I confirmed that. So I checked the defendant's regular phone number, searched Google, and found ten defendant blogs. There was a criticism of the foreign ministry, and the reason why I criticized it was that my majors were changed and I was disadvantageous to my job. The second time I was raped by my ancestor, I saw a picture of him taking off his clothes, wearing panties and wearing a bucket, and checking his account to ask him to donate himself a little. I was criticizing many other foreigners, and after all that was the right thing, I applied for a seizure search warrant and got a warrant for seizure search at Seoul Central District Court. So I went to the house with a formal search warrant. The computer in the defendant's room was unused, there was a computer in the next room study, I looked at both computers and found nothing related to the crime. Then there was another room next to the kitchen, and the visit was locked, so I asked my mother to open the door and I knew that maybe I could have entered one. I went in and got a laptop and I saw that the computer language was in French so we did not know French so I had no idea what folder my computer was or what folder it was. When we checked the digital evidence analyzer, President Obama and two of the original captures of Ambassador Ripper were found immediately, so I suspected the defendant had written it, and then shut it down. It was probably about 20:42. I then disconnected the hard disk from the notebook. After we disconnected it, we connected it to the computer cloning equipment, then we had the original hard disk, reconnected the copy hard disk and cloned the same. When you make a copy, the hash value of the hard disk on the defendant's laptop is the same as the replicated hard disk. For example, a hash value is a tool for proving integrity. If the defendant's computer hash value is A, then the hash value of our copy hard disk will be equal to A. Then, in the state of A, if we do not touch the copy, we do the analysis in the same A state whether or not it is sealed. When analyzing a copy of computer A, there is a write-protect device, not just an analysis. Since the integrity of a computer hard disk is immediately broken when we connect it to the hard disk protector, no matter what I analyze by connecting the copy, the copy hard disk is not changed at all. And the file called Imaging is created as a file, and the file can not be changed. If it changes, if you change the hash on the hard disk of the copy, it will be changed to B instead of A. That's why the hard disk you image is the same as analyzing with the same original A anytime and anywhere. It was discovered, and we proceeded with the seizure search for four hours at that time, and the defendant was lying in his room with only panties and not at all until we went. I asked him, ""Is this the right thing you wrote on your laptop,"" and then I drank a little and said, ""I do not know at all. We talked that way, and we persuaded him for three hours, even though he was able to arrest an emergency at the time because of the destruction of the evidence and the reasons for it in the future. Q: Is the date and time of the seizure of the seizure on July 13, 1945? A: Yes, I would have probably started from then. Q: Was the confiscated lenovo B490 laptop computer, four hard disks, and a USB stick? Answer: There was a bit of a mistake, but I checked my laptop for evidence and immediately shut down my computer and immediately started imaging. I opened the imaging and sealed my laptop right away. Because the integrity was changed, I sealed it. When I sealed it, my mother wrote it, and I put my mother 's letter, we rolled it with tape and sealed it. There was a virtual machine program called VMware installed. If you do not have a computer notebook, then you may not be able to analyze it in the future, so we need the original, so the notebook is seized separately. Q: On the defendant's laptop computer, isis.png, usa.png, a file capturing screen captures of each blackmail? Answer: Yes. Q: Did the defendant confirm the source of each file shortly after the discovery? A: I asked, but I can not remember exactly whether you talked in the way that you downloaded it from the internet or you did not talk at all. Anyway, he denied that he did not. Because I received too many surveys, I did not know exactly what I said at the time, but I told him that I did not do it anyway. Q: I checked the creation date and time of each capture file. Was it confirmed within 1 minute immediately after each crime? Answer: Yes. Q: After I image the defendant's laptop, why did I confiscate the original because the original laptop computer needed to be analyzed? Answer: Yes, yes. This is because the virtual machine VMware was installed. VMware is a virtual machine computer, and now you have a computer in it, and you can create a computer to run multiple computers. If you have a computer in your computer, you can not leave any trace of it on this computer, but if you log in to the virtual machine again and enter it, it will crime the virtual machine and delete the related files for the virtual machine The need to analyze the machine has confiscated the original. judge To witnesses Q: Because the defendant's laptop computer had VMware installed ... A: Yes, it was and was a forfeit. Q: Is it because the original reason for the confiscation of the original was that VMware was installed on the defendant's laptop computer? A: Yes, if you do not have a laptop, you may not be able to analyze it. Q: Why did you confiscate the original after imaging? A: I have an image and the file of the virtual machine is once again in the imaging file. The original notebook is required to run the file. inspection To witnesses Q: After you confiscated the defendant's laptop computer, did you get confirmation from the Mo Kim OO of the defendant's Confirmation of Confirmation of the Confirmation of the Confidential Material and Confidential Information? Answer: It was not received by me, but analyst Kim Kyung-hwan received it. Q: Did you stay together at the reception desk? Answer: Yes. Q: After that, did you arrest the defendant in an emergency and arrange it in the office of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency? Answer: Yes. We did not do it in. We went with the broadcaster and us and once in. Q: Is there any fact that the defendant raped at the time? Answer: Yes. Q: How did you get upset? A: We had an investigation with us and the cybercrime detective. Inch was in the broadcaster 's office. We were not with the defendant. As you can see from the video attached, I heard that you have kicked your feet from the ""Bring your chair from your boss"" and you can see exactly how it got into the riot. The record is attached as a CD. Q: Who was the person who identified the situation at the time? A: I was an investigator at a broad-based investigation. The person who wrote the CD investigation report attached to the record probably would have taken it. In the analysis of the defendant's laptop computer, the e-mail address, Twitter address, and phone number of the case were listed, and the Korean ambassador said, ""I will surely kill Ambassador Ripper, I will give you an anal rape. ""Also, did you find a file called 's.txt' that contains the same content as the case of this case report? Answer: Yes, the intimidating text was written in English at the White House, but I found a text file containing the blackmail in Korean on the defendant's notebook. Q: The creation date and time of link files 'A0065359.1nk', \_A0065518.1nk, 'A0065541.1nk' and 'A0065621.1nk' linked to 's.txt' file are all 2014. 9. 10. 16:59 , And the date and time of access were confirmed on July 7, 2014, at 14:57, 21:10, 21:19, 22:31. Answer: Yes. In addition, the defendant's notebook also includes photos of Ambassador Ripper and Kim Kyeong-jong, who have been terrorized, photos of Mr. and Mrs. Obama as monkeys, and Cheongwadae's homepage. Did you find a capture file that you uploaded? A: Yes, many photos were found. In particular, an article or photograph was found about the Kim Kyeong-jong case to threaten the Ambassador Ripper. The date and time the file was stored was reported by Kim Kyeong-jong. The defendant captured it and stored it. The date the file was last accessed, so the date it was read was almost immediately before the incident. I remember so. In addition, a small boy 'isis.jpg' file that combines shooting shot and armed robbery, a picture of a young boy shooting a prisoner with a gun, and a picture of our gallery, Did you find the 'ISIS Gallery.png' file? ANSWER: Yes, many photos related to ISIS have been found. Q: Did the defendant tell you that he or she synthesized the pictures and pictures of each file at the time of the police investigation? Lawyer Your Honor, this part is not appropriate because we are asking the defendant's denial of the contents of the police investigation at the time of the investigation. inspection Because the Criminal Procedure Law has introduced the investigator testimony system, I think it is safe to hear how I made statements at the time. Lawyer I would like to say that it is not inappropriate to listen again to the content denied. judge Once this part is just ask. inspection To witnesses Q: I'll ask you again. Did the defendant state that at the time of the police investigation, he had synthesized photos and pictures of each file? A: I can not remember exactly because I did not see the suspect newspaper report now. Q: Also, did the defendant's laptop have a program called 'SuperHideIP' that allows you to change your IP once a mouse is clicked? Answer: Yes. Q: And did you find a capture file called 'IP address washing method .jpg'? Answer: Yes. Q: On the other hand, did you find that the defendant is running 10 blogs of blogspot, the Google blog? Answer: Yes. Q: In each blog, were the defendant's Citibank account number and the defendant's PayPal ID listed? Answer: Yes. Question: Did the defendant's blog reveal or condemn the complaints about Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, and the images depicting women and the bizarre situation? Answer: Yes.

Q: How did the accused describe the 'isis.png' and 'usa.png' files found on the defendant's laptop? Answer: I stated that I did not know at all. Q: What did you say about the source? Answer: I asked a few questions about the source, and I did not remember exactly because I made a different statement every time. I replied that I had captured and downloaded it from 4chan site and saved it or I did not know it at all. Q: How did the defendant describe the 's.txt' file? A: I just do not know ... I've been asking that a lot, but at first I thought it was the one I wrote, and then I did not answer at all. Q: How did the defendant tell us about the photos of the Ambassador Repertor, the photos of the Obama couple and the photos of armed robbers, etc. A: I think I talked about not knowing much about the questions I asked.

I do a little bit of research to help each other. Q: Have you ever seen a document requesting cooperation in the US? A: I have never seen it. Q: When I contacted the US Embassy, I heard someone wrote a blackmail in an e-mail. Have you heard this story? Answer: No. Q: How many people were involved in the seizure and search? A: Five Cybercrime detectives, five forensic investigators. When I got there, my father told me to leave. So there were about 6 \~ 7 people in the place, but I did not know exactly and some went out. Q: Do you think six or seven people have been around? Answer: Yes. The witness explained the details of the process of tracing the defendant in advance, saying, ""The clue only had an IP address, but it was difficult to find by IP address alone. I checked the subscriber on Dongdaemun Tibur Road, but I could not confirm it, so I made a request to the Mac address again. "" Answer: You have checked your Mac to investigate with a Mac address. Q: Who identified the Mac? Answer: When IP is allocated from the carrier, IP and MAC are connected to the carrier. If you know the MAC of the IP you used for the crime at the time, you can do the investigation again with the MAC address. But that Mac did not come out correctly either. Anyway, I have a network switch, and I've finally assigned that IP ... So you have confirmed the last switch. Q: Is it confirmed that you have three sets of equipment? Answer: Yes, I have to explain the connection ... Q: When the attorney heard this, the witness first asked for the Mac address and asked the carrier to recall the Mac address. Answer: To investigate with a Mac address ... judge I heard that I wanted to know the MAC address, but I do not know it. witness Yes, that's why we proceeded with the investigation. judge To witnesses Q: In the end, you did not check your Mac address? Answer: I understand that you tampered with the Mac. Q: At that time, at first ... A: I can not confirm it right away. Lawyer To witnesses Q: Is it about collecting digital evidence, and what experts have participated? A: The analyst Kim Kyung-hwan participated and I participated. I had to undergo a little bit of analysis. I have a license to analyze digital evidence. Q: During the seizure process, was the digital evidence analyst one of Kim Kyung Hwan's analysts? A: Yes, but I was not an official digital evidence analyst. While doing the investigation ... Q: Witnesses also have that knowledge? A: Yes, I did it. Q: So, at the time of the seizure, did two or more people have expertise in digital evidence? Answer: Yes. Q: What did the related equipment bring? Answer: I did not get a hard disk replicator and ... I think you should ask Kim Kyung-hwan, but I only took the warrant. Q: What is the process of identifying the date and time of White House intimidation during the investigation? A: Our International Cooperation Team of the National Police Agency told us that this was the case at this time ... Q: Do you not know how the team works? Answer: I do not know exactly. Q: I found a picture of a blackmail on the defendant's laptop, was it the time of the confiscation, or is it afterwards? A: I did not discover it first, but I know that Kim Kyeong-hwan or Kim Jin-kwang, one of the investigators, found it. Q: You were discovered at the time of the seizure? ANSWER: Yes, I just found a picture, shot it on my phone and shut down my laptop. \-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- \-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- \-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- A: The 4chan site is USA, so we can not verify the subscribers. Q: Did not you know who posted it? Answer: Yes. But ask Kim Jin-kwang again for this question. Moon: Looking at the flow of investigation, it's like ... A: I remember that there was such a situation, but I do not know exactly, so I can ask Kim Jin-kwang. Q: Who wrote the seizure? A: There must be an author of the seizure. Moon: Lieutenant Kim Sang-guk, Lieutenant Cho Yong-woo is like this ... Answer: Yes. Q: Witnesses were with you at the time? A: Yes, I was with you. I can not do everything because I work in the office while doing the division of labor. Q: In the confiscation list, the confiscation of the defendant's laptop itself is listed, but the imaging file for the defendant's laptop imaging is not on the confiscation list, do you know? A: I did not know it because I did not write it. I know that I need to write a notebook imaging number 1 on the serial number. Q: Anyway, is it obvious that the laptop imaging was done at the time of the search? Answer: Yes. Q: How many hours did it take? A: You can ask Kim Kyung-hwan, a digital evidence analyst. Q: Because I have experience analyzing digital evidence, I'll ask. What does hash value mean in digital evidence collection and analysis? Answer: MD5 and SHA1 are one of the functions for proving integrity. For example, if you put this stuff into this hash function, you get some specific result. But it is not an inverse function. For example, if you put a file called A and B into a hash function, you will get a certain unique value, which means that if the unique value is the same, it is the same information. So if you turn the hash value of the hard disk in the original and get A, and you get the A by rotating the hash of the hard disk that replicated the original, you can prove that the original and replicated hard disk information is the same. Q: Do you see that digital evidence is in a specific state at the time you generate the hash value, and then do you assume the integrity and authenticity of the original until it is examined by the court? Answer: The question is ambiguous, not a specific state ... Q: I'll ask you a little bit. When I image the defendant's laptop and get the hashed value, the defendant's laptop is at that point in time, right? Answer: If you run a hash function on a file named A instead of a state, you will get a specific result. Whenever it does, the same result is produced, not the state at that point ... Q: The hash value is telling you when the first was created. Answer: Yes, that's right. Q: What is the point of creating the integrity of a file at a particular point in time? Answer: Yes. Q: After that, of course, you can come up several times, and I'll tell you when it was first created. A: I do not understand the question. Q: When I image the defendant's laptop, is the state of the defendant's laptop at that time imitated as evidence in the court? Answer: Imaged files can not be changed. Q: Is it still maintained? A: I guarantee that my police will not change until I send them to the prosecution. But after that, I do not know. Q: If you look at the notebook imaging file at the court, the file we're looking at is the same as the file at the time the witness did the imaging at the time of the seizure? Answer: Yes. Q: Is it fixed at that point? Answer: Yes. Q: So is not the hash value guaranteeing the integrity of the earlier steps we collected in the first time we collected the confidential search? Answer: Because it is the hash value at the time of imaging ... Q: From then on, to guarantee integrity, not to guarantee the integrity of the old, right? A: Yes, it does not make sense. Q: So, if someone logs out a hash after logically manipulating the computer, does not it provide information about the operation or operation before the hash value is created? Answer: Of course. Q: At the time of the seizure, was the defendant's notebook turned off? A: I do not remember exactly. That's not what I brought ... Q: I turned on the notebook and said that I saw one or the other. A: I can not remember exactly because my mother brought me something in the other room. We could not get in that room. Q: The seizure start time was around July 13, 2015, and the power of the notebook was turned on and off from July 13, 2015 to 20:47. The laptop was on for about 41 minutes. What did you do on the laptop at this time? A: At that time, I did not work, and I would probably have been working on finding analysts and files. Q: Did you write protection at that time? A: I did not do it then. Q: In the process of looking at the defendant's laptop, did he / she guarantee the right of the defendant or the defendant's parents to participate? Answer: It was said. &amp;#x200B;"

Answer: I do not know that, I talk to you again ... Q: Did you talk to the defendant? A: Yes, I keep coming and going now ... Q: Have you ever taken a video of a defendant's laptop or imaging process? A: It might have been done by a broadcaster, but I do not know exactly. Oh, I tried to shoot it, but I can not, so why do I just shoot my house? Q: Who has not let me? A: I do not know if they were parents or defendants who were there, but I strongly resisted them and I would have taken our picture there. If you look at the mobile phone, there might be some videos that we took pictures of. And then he just threw something at us and made it a bit harder. In the case of Kim Kyung-Hwan, the analyst would have been hit. Q: When I said that I needed an original copy of VMware for the reason why I confiscated the defendant's laptop, would not it be necessary to have a laptop if the program that runs VMware is on another PC? Answer: No. Depending on the version, it may not work. Q: Can I check the version in the imaging file? A: It was not a situation where you could do it on the spot, and if you wanted to drive it ... Q: It is technically possible to ask. Is it possible to have a program that can run VMware on another PC even if it is not a defendant's laptop? Answer: It is possible but not 100% guaranteed. So there were many cases where we were not able to drive properly. judge To witnesses Q: Is it common to have the notebook itself confiscated after imaging files? A: If we are confiscated, we will do all the confiscation. Q: Do you confiscate the imaging files as well as the notebook itself if you are in confiscation? A: Yes, because it is a laptop used for crime. Lawyer To witnesses Q: Did you say the witness took the seizure search warrant? Answer: We took it from our team. Q: Have you read it? Answer: Yes. Q: If you look at it, it is stated that ""the original that has been taken out will be opened and reproduced with the participation of the intruder, etc. and returned without any delay, but not exceeding 10 days from the original date of export unless there are special circumstances"" Why did not you return it? Answer: Computers have a very important time relationship in the evidence of digital evidence analysis. At that time, we analyzed the digital evidence analysis of the seized material to confirm the creation and access times. Last but not least, you can change your laptop's CMOS (cmos) time accordingly. There is an error depending on the time of the CMOS. So what if my laptop is at 1 o'clock, but the current time is 1: 5? We need to check the error in time. We need a laptop to check the error. We can return it before we send it to the last time. We asked our attorney and computer to turn on and check only the error with the defendant. Probably will be in the investigation report. So the prosecution has to check it out, it can not be sealed. So I know that the prosecution has confirmed the exact time information after taking a video of the whole process of releasing and releasing it. So it's been over a week. Q: What did the witness know to return? Answer: Yes. But you did not return, right? Answer: Yes. Moon: White House Contact us Write on the web page and select ""Thank you!"" Was there a picture on the defendant's notebook that captured the screen to write the previous post? A: I do not understand. Q: I have a screen that I'm writing before submitting. When I submit it, I get a screen saying 'Thank you!'. Can not these two screens exist at the same time? Answer: Yes. Q: Do you have a picture of the screen after the last submission of the statement ""Thank you!"" On the defendant's notebook? Answer: Yes. Q: Then you should have a screenshot of the scene you're writing in. Have you seen it? Answer, isis.png and usa.png are being written and Thank you! Screen and combine ... Q: It's a composite, is not it? Answer: Yes. Perhaps you have not found what you are writing. It did not exist because it was edited and made into a png file. Maybe, if you can explain it. Q: You said that five files were found on the defendant's laptop using Google Chrome, remember? Answer: Yes. Q: In the first post, I do not have a caption of an isis.png file that says I will rape my daughter, do you know why? A: That's probably what you see in the investigation report, but if you capture and delete it and then change the filename or the file does not exist, or if you capture it using the Google Chrome browser's incognito mode, There are many technical ways that you can and can not keep up with many things. Q: But what about the file 'Thank you!', What happened? A: I can not tell you that because I have nothing to do with the evidence, it's because I want to leave it and I want to keep it. Q: Is that technically possible? Answer: Yes. Q: You did not find any traces of access to the White House on the defendant's laptop? Answer: I did not find it at all. Q: By the way, 'Thank you!' I have found that I captured the part, how should I explain it? A: If you use the Google Chrome browser's incognito mode, the Internet connection itself will not be saved as a file at all. It will only be saved as a cache, but it will not be saved as soon as you close the web browser. I will. Q: As the witness has just testified, it would be nice to have no screenshot of 'Thank you!' , A: That means you do not have a record of your Internet connection and you can leave a capture file. Q: After the capture file, the number is actually a Unix number, so you can log in to Google Chrome to get information on when you captured it, but the witness does not have an article written right now and it probably does not capture it in Google Incognito mode. You just did. That's why I do not ask you to leave the ""Thank you!"" Section in incognito mode. A: Internet access records and captions are completely different. Q: Why do not you leave a screenshot called ""Thank you!"" In response to an incognito answer saying that you may not have a captured file. Answer: The defendant remains on the defendant's computer because he has captured and saved it. Q: So it is possible that you have to do it in the same conditions that you captured before that ... Answer: If you do not want to leave, you can not leave. Q: Then you can find the erased trail? Now that I've imaged the defendant's laptop, I'm not just looking at it, have I removed the deleted file? Answer: When I go into incognito mode, I have worked and can not restore it. Why did Google create incognito mode? I have tested it myself. judge To witnesses Q: Did you know whether the defendant used incognito mode? Answer: It can not be confirmed. Google has made the feature available to you when you're trying to do it in secret, and of course you can not tell whether or not you used it. Lawyer To witnesses Q: When I go into incognito mode, I do not think the capture screen should be saved. Answer: No. Saved is that the internet connection is stored in the index.dat and various computer hard disks, and the connection record is not stored. In the case of the captured file, it is possible to store it anywhere in the desired location, The captured files are completely separate. Q: Did the witness confirm the blog posts that the defendant usually wrote? Answer: Yes. Q: Have you seen any criticism of Kim Kyeong-jong about the case of Repert's ambassador in the defendant's blog post? A: I do not remember everything right now. I only remember what I said before. Q: I do not remember? Answer: Yes. Q: I had an emergency arrest of the defendant at the time, but was there any reason for the emergency arrest? A: Because I did not do it, I would look at the reasons for the arrest. Q: I do not have a reason for an emergency arrest, so what do you ask? A: Why is not the reason written? You have to write down your reasons for getting an emergency arrest proposal. (Suggesting an investigation record, page 455) Q: The reason for the arrest has been listed all the time. Please write down the details according to the reason for the emergency arrest. That's it. do not have. A: I did not write it, but at the metro ... Oh, that's what you said about the notice. In the notice, we wrote the reason for the emergency arrest for the approval from the prosecutor's office without writing the reason, and is not the suspect notified to the suspect when the emergency arrest occurs? Because it is putting in notice, it is because it is because it is very simple to summarize the fact of crime. That is not what I wrote. Do not ask me. Q: Who wrote it? Answer: There will be a writer. judge Is there an emergency arrest warrant? witness Yes. Lawyer To witnesses Q: Is there a reason listed there? Not on record ... Answer: Yes, detailed. inspection An Emergency Arrest Form with detailed description of the reason is available. Lawyer To witnesses Q: The witness did not write the confiscation list? Yes, I did not write it. Q: Do you know who wrote it? A: Then several people are working on it ... Q: What are the threats and screen capture files that the defendant claims to have downloaded and that the witness or investigating agency believes that the defendant has written and captured it? Answer: Yes. Q: If I download a screened file and save it on the defendant's laptop, is it possible that it exists in the same format as the one captured by the defendant's laptop as the witness verified? A: There are two ways. Probably Kim Jin-kwang will test it and have an investigation report because of 4chan. If you click on the original file to download it, it will be downloaded. Otherwise, if you click on the original file, the image file will pop up and you can download it with right mouse click. That is another report from our investigation. I did not test it ... Q: Is there a file name that might be the same as the one you captured? A: I do not understand. Again only a description ... Q: If I downloaded the defendant's laptop, I just analyzed the file name just like the one I captured on the defendant's laptop, can it exist with the same file name? A: You should be in the record. Ask Kim Jin-kwang because I have not tested it. Q: Do you not know the witness? Answer: We have tested and simulated in the investigation report. Q: The time order is the time the defendant posted on the White House, the time they saved on the laptop after the screen capture, and the time they posted on the site [4chan.org](URL A: If it is so in the investigation report, it will. Because I can not remember correctly now, I made a table, and I look at it. Lawyer I will present evidence. I present one or two of the fifth certificate. judge What is the source? Lawyer This is what the defendant's brother searched on Google after he had been arrested after the incident. If you look at the same thing on Google ... you know, but you searched on Google. Here you see 'dear. Mr.president Obama, Mrs.first lady Mishelle ', and the time it was found that this article was written is posted on 4chan site on July 7, 2015. 7. 07:24:52. inspection How can I confirm that this is the same as this article? Lawyer To witnesses Q: If you see below, 'Hi I'm sufs student from Seoul' because some part of the post is behind it? It seems that the article is the same, but the time zone is quite different now. The time is 07:24:52 AM. Now, the time to write the article is July 7, 20:20. By the way, the time posted on 4chan site is July 7, 2015, 07:24:52. A: In our investigation report, we have captured the exact time on 4chan site. That's precise, because it's from a Google search, so you can not tell exactly what time it was on Google or 4chan. Q: If you saved it from Google, is it any time sooner than we know it? Answer: There is no guarantee for low-time information. Q: Witnesses have never seen this? Answer: Yes. There is not. And whether it is US storage time, domestic storage time ... Q: For the second article, it looks like it was written on July 7, 2015. Did you know that the 4chan site time that the witness checked was stored in domestic time when posting in Korea? A: Ask Kim Jin-kwang, the investigator. Q: Do you not know the witness? Answer: We have posted the post on 4chan site and we have the current time and the test time. That's exactly what we tested. If you look at it, you can check whether the 4chan site has domestic time or US time. Q: Have you ever checked your time zone separately? A: Yes, I have not done it, so I can not tell you exactly. Q: Did you say that the defendant used a program called SuperHideIP, an IP change program? A: It's not a confirmation, it's a program that was installed. It was discovered. Q: Are there any facts that have been analyzed that the last approach was made on June 6, 2015, before the date on which the blackmail was written? Answer: The file was found, the date the file was first saved, and the date the file was last accessed. Q: I analyzed it as the last access on June 6, 2015. Is it possible to interpret the IP as having no change since then? A: It may or may not have been because there are too many technical methods, which I do not know exactly. Q: Because the witness did not see whether the defendant wrote the program or not, but after all, did you look at the defendant's laptop? Is there a similar program in the program that changes the IP found this one? A: You can not see the whole thing. When we analyze ... Q: Do you have to search and search? So, what was the one that was discovered in connection with the IP change program? Answer: Yes. Q: Did you investigate the router? A: I heard there was a router, but I did not investigate. Question: Do you think that the defendant's notebook imaging file was the first image of the notebook file, or was it replicated again? A: Because I did not analyze it ... Q: What did you do to replicate that day? A: Did we bring the clone? Q: Who took it? A: The analyst Kim Kyung Hwan should have brought it. \-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- It seems that the time has changed to Korean time in the process of being seated. Answer: The analysis report is the final one, and we have to investigate a little bit before we start the analysis. So I took the printout, put it in the investigation report, and made a note when I checked it out. How do you investigate having a fully written report? Q: The decisive reason for suspicion that the defendant wrote the blackmail was that the capture file that was left on the defendant's notebook was created about a minute after it was posted on the White House? ANSWER: When I was threatened, however, I wrote two blackmails on the White House website in English, which was in the S.txt file written in Hangul and the summer @ hufs You said you stole your .ac.kr email and phone number? Maybe that phone number and address were in the s.txt file and ... Q: Witness, I tried to ask this, not many charges. Was it one of the decisive proofs that the creation time of the capture file was one minute after the article was published? Answer: There were many things. Q: What is the difference between the time the article was posted in the White House and the time the capture file was stored on the defendant's laptop, A: It's not an analysis, but an objective fact ... Q: How did you know when the post was posted on the White House? A: You asked us that, but we have only received data from the international team. Q: I think the one minute car will be a very important basis, right? Answer: Yes. Q: Then I ask you in terms of whether the investigation should be done enough about time. I have to be specific from the time it is posted on the White House, but the time posted on the White House is probably the time that the person administering the White House homepage gave me, and that time could be time lag in the end? A: When we told it, we were GMT + 9? The United States has several times, including Eastern Time. I'm not exactly sure if we are Eastern Standard Time for letting us know what the error is, but it probably will. It calculates the time and the error, and when domestic time is converted into Korea Standard Time, it is time to calculate the exact time and the IP connected to the time is Dongdaemun Cable TV ... Q: I do not ask for the calculation method. For example, if this computer now has 16:00 on the front of the laptop, is there any error in that? I'm looking at it. There may be an error in the time given by the White House, and there may be an error in the time when the witness etc. So I'm asking how the time difference can be determined to be one minute. Answer: Because we are made by objective data, we have confirmed that we know the time we have stored on our computers and the time we have been threatened. Q: Do you know that there is a program that can change the date of creation of saved files? Answer: Yes. Q: I have a couple of things, but can I use a program like SetFileDate to change the creation date of a saved file? Answer: Yes. Q: Is it possible that the defendant 's notebook has changed so much? Answer: Not all computers, as well as the defendant's laptop, are capable of such manipulation. However, when you analyze the MFT, the information about the time is stored in various ways. If you analyze MFT's standard information information and file name information information and analyze that the information is different, you can check whether the time has been manipulated or not, whether the file name has been changed. Q: Did you check it at the time? A: I did not check at the time. Q: When the MAC address of the router is changed, is the dynamic IP connected to it also changed? A: It may or may not appeal, but it is the policy of the telecommunications company. Q: Did the witness verify the MAC address corresponding to the IP address associated with this case during the investigation? Answer: Yes. Q: Is it a witness? A: I would have done it together. Q: What was the result? A: I put it in the comments, but the contents of the mac are too complicated, so I think I should look at the written statement. I do not remember exactly now. Q: Have you found any signs of changing the MAC address of the router on the defendant's laptop? A: The digital evidence analyst found it. Q: Is the witness unaware of this part? Answer: I heard that there is a trace of change that I am not familiar with. Q: Does the analyst in the role of analyst only do the analysis, or did he conduct additional investigations besides analysis? Answer: I just did analysis. Q: According to the results of the analysis, was the witness doing any further investigations? Answer: What is the additional investigation? Q: For example, if you find a trace of a change in your mac address, I would ask you if you needed to check the defendant's router, did not you? Answer: The MAC address is the manufacturer of the first six digits, and the manufacturer assigns the last six digits of the MAC address. We have probably seen a counter-report of the defendant's comment on the mac address, but if the manufacturer makes a random change to it I can not do the investigation anymore. Your lawyer tells you that if the mac has been changed, and if you have not done any further investigations about it, there is no clue that you can investigate anymore if mac has changed that way. Q: I asked if I needed to check the defendant's router. A: When we did the transcription, the digital evidence analysis was at the end, and I have to hand over the suspect's recruits to the prosecution office tomorrow. What do you do? Q: Did you mean you could not do it on time? Answer: Yes. Q: There was a trace of changing the MAC address on the defendant's laptop, and there was analysis that released the log record at the time of the crime, remember? A: I told you I did not do it. Q: Do you know this by Kim Kyung Hwan? Answer: Yes. Question: According to the statement of witness submitted by the witness in relation to the mac address, there are several mac addresses that are not confirmed by the manufacturer. If the maker changes to an unconfirmed mac address, Go? Answer: I do not know the carrier policy, so I can not answer exactly, I know it is not. Q: Do you know that if you change to an unconfirmed mac address depending on your carrier policy, Internet access may be restricted? ANSWER: Yes, there is a case where the switch is allowed to access the internet when only a certain MAC address is connected, which is called NAC. If you do not set this policy, you are allowed to connect from the internet regardless of the MAC address. This is the carrier policy. There are two technologies on the switch that can or may not be blocked. Q: I know that if you change your router or MAC address arbitrarily, you may be restricted from accessing the Internet. Do you know? For example, have you ever heard of such cases in Windows 7 or Windows 8? Answer: Not at all. However, if you change the mac address, there is no problem with internet access. Q: Is there any problem with the computer? A: Yes, it takes less than a minute and you can do it right away. judge To witnesses Q: I have a question about the defendant's question. ""I wrote on the White House Contact us webpage, and I found 'Thank you!' In response to the question ""Did the defendant have a picture of the screen capturing the screen before writing the screen?"", The witness said, ""No one was writing, because it was edited and made into a png file."" I have an answer, please tell me about it again. A: The screen you are composing and the screen where you have completed the 'Thank you! 1' screen was synthesized as a png file, but the screen you were composing was not saved and only the pictures that were composited were correct . But it's technically possible to synthesize it. Q: Please explain how technically possible. Answer: Take a picture of A with a capture tool such as Paint or Snap-in, capture a picture of B, put B under A, select the file again and save the file as a different file. I will explain it again. When you capture the screen you are creating with the Google Chrome browser, you will see the url address and the time next to it. Then, when you save it to the defendant's computer in that state, click the right mouse button and save it under the same name. Then, when you capture the screen 'Thank you!', You will see the url address and time information at the top and 'Thank you!'. And if you save it under a different name, it will be saved on the defendant's computer. However, technically you can right click on the 'Thank you!' Screen and save it to your computer. You can take the first screen without saving it, and then use the Paint or other capture tool If you save this file as usa.png or isis.png, you will not be able to save the first image you created, and the second image will be saved You can save only the final result at the end. Q: I was wondering if it was possible technically, but you answered with the idea that it is possible? Answer: Yes. inspection To witnesses Q: I heard that the screen of the writing on the defendant's notebook is not found, but the relevant screen is not found, and the capture file of the process of posting on the White House site is found. A: Yes, it does not matter, but I do not know exactly what happened before in June, but before that I had a copy of the White House story that I was capturing and capturing. If you are writing a webpage, you will see a wave in Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Safari, and spelling. If you're writing on the White House website, Due to the law of alignment, a tilde appears at the bottom of the English alphabet. If you look at it, you can see that it is a screen that you are writing. I captured it and kept other articles, but I do not remember it correctly. I think it was related to black slaves at that time. Q: In regards to the reporter ambassador threatening text, did you also find a separate screen capture of only the result screen ""Thank you!""?

Q: In a little more detail, did you participate at the time of the seizure? A: Yes, I also participated in the seizure search and I had to check a lot of posts first to get a warrant, and I had a lot of focus on that part, and when I was in the seizure search site, When I did not have a laptop or something like this. So, there are some parts that we have fielded with other investigators to secure evidence. Q: What role did you play in the seized search site? Answer: First, I thought it was important to find a laptop. The defendant posted a blog on the blog.

A: Yes, so I tried hard to find a laptop. Q: Do you remember how you found your laptop? Answer: Yes, when I first entered, the defendant was lying in bed, and when I tried to go into the room with a search warrant, I could not go in for about 30 minutes because the defendant 's parents never entered.

Q: There are some documents attached to the investigation report written by witnesses, some of which have been downloaded from the Internet. Where did the data from the defendant's notebook come from? Answer: Most of the Internet postings are written by me, and the parts of the investigation report are written by Kim, Kyung-Hwan, because they can not share the system because the team is different. So I made this same data with me, so I checked it out. I wrote this investigation report together with Kim Kyung Hwan, and I printed it out. Q: Does the analyst Kim have output? Answer: Yes. judge To witnesses Q: I said I wrote an Internet post, but I misstated it? Answer: First of all, 4chan or something like this is what I did after capturing separately, and the parts from the defendant's notebook were written by me because Kim Kyung-hwan's analyst could not write the investigation report.

Q: I have two hours to show evidence that there is evidence so far, so I know what it is. I am talking about the 3:23:30, the 24 hour hour, the 15:23? Please explain what this time means. You do not know because you wrote it? A: I did not focus on the time when writing, but instead of backing up the original files on my desktop computer, I created a folder called ""Terrorist"" and had an original under it, There is a method and a download button called isis.png below it. I clicked on that button and downloaded it in two ways, but the important thing is that the investigation report was written to specify that 'MD5 is the same, if MD5 is the same, this file is the same' I saved the file to my computer and compared it with it, and I do not remember the date exactly. Q: Is not it time you saved your witness computer? A: Yes, it is not. Q: Now, three files have the same MD5, but the same thing means that the first file is the same file? Answer: Yes.

Q: What is the meaning of time now that you do not know exactly? A: I guess it's probably the time on the defendant's laptop, but where did the source of usa.png come from?

Q: Did you participate? Answer: The defendant did not participate, and the defendant 's mother said that she participated, so she did the imaging in front of the defendant' s mother.

A: I think I just took a picture when I first went in. Q: Did you take videos or pictures about the process of imaging? A: I think I did not. Q: It is related to the witness who wrote the investigation report. If there is a screen-captured file and you download the file from 4chan and save it, the two will clearly distinguish between the captured and downloaded files from the defendant's notebook. Can you do it? Answer: Although the name of the file can be changed because the computer is clearly distinguished, the root cause of the screen capture is a program called full page screen capture on the defendant's computer. When you capture using this program, the file name is created uniquely. Because there is a name and a date and it is hard for ordinary people to write it, so if there is such a thing, it should be said that it was programmed ... Q: Even if you download the same thing, you are asking if you are following it. Answer: If the filename remains the same, if you receive usa.png when you download it, then usa.png follows, and the url where the full-page screen was originally printed does not appear. Moon: usa.png but not url ... Answer: If you have url, you can get it as it is. Q: If you download it in that state, is not it well separated? Answer: Yes. Q: And can you download and rename it? Answer: Yes. Q: If I remove the value of zone.identifier attached to the downloaded file, will it be impossible to check whether it is a downloaded file or not? A: I do not know. (Presenting the first and second Google search screens of the certificate No. 5) Q: I searched on Google that the first blackmail related article was stored on 4chan site. This is what I came up with in search of the text, which is exactly the same as the number you saw. It is the first blackmail article that I have been suspected to have written by the defendant. There is a time called July 7, 07. 07:24:52, and the time of the first blackmail was written on July 7, 20:20, right? The time to upload to 4chan is much faster, do you have any idea about this? A: I do not know because it is not confirmed. Q: This is what the witness made when he wrote the investigation report. If you posted in Korea, you would be posting Korean time on 4chan site? So the time I posted on the 4chan site was later than the time of the file on the laptop because the defendant wrote it. But now the time I searched on Google is much faster than the time I posted on the case. That 's why I ask. Q: I do not know exactly what I am talking about. But first of all, this is Google. I do not know how to write url in 4chan, and the way it's written in Google would be wrong, because I did not see it. Q: Does the witness have any experience in analyzing digital evidence? A: I joined Cyber Special, basically there is no digital analysis and I have listened to education or lecture. Q: Is not there a career?

Q: You have been trained in the National Police Agency? A: I have a police station and I'm in a database. Q: Was the witness involved in the investigation that changed the defendant's MAC address? A: I joined the investigation together but I do not remember exactly. The story seems to have done a lot. Q: Have you been involved in the investigation that led you to receive a Mac address that matched the IP address that you sent the search warrant to Tibur Road? A: It was not me. Q: I have an analysis that says that the defendant's laptop analysis results have been released so that the logs stored in the router are not released in the adjacent time zone of the time when they wrote the article. Do you know this part? A: That part is written by Kim Kyung-Hwan. Q: Does the witness know this part well? Answer: Yes. judge To witnesses Q: Is it true that the witness's statement is unclear, and that he was working at a private database company in relation to his career in analyzing digital evidence, and then joined Cybercrime as a specialist? A: Sometimes the process of coming to the police comes to the general public, and if you have more than a few years of social work, you may be able to get a special bond. The part I majored in is the database, and I've come across a lot of hacks and stuff like that. Q: I have an editorial story ... Answer: It is the part of the license.

Answer: The link files that are randomly numbered starting with A are the volumes used by the system called system volume information. At first, when I explained the time when the volume was used, I tried using it in Windows 7 As you know, there is a feature called Restore Computer. I have a feature called restoring the computer that will take a snapshot, so Windows 7 will automatically back up. So, at that time, I automatically backed up the list of files or files in a certain period of time, and the backup location is the system volume information folder, and a folder is created under each backed up day. A link file pointing to txt has been found. Q: The operating system of the defendant's laptop is XP. Does XP have the same function? Answer: Yes.

Kim Young-rae Moon: In the case of Ambassador Repert, I am living in Korea, and since I have actually received an assassination, is anyone seen to be able to attack if I feel like it? Answer: It is very likely. Kim Young-rae Moon: Does the suspect think of the relationship between the United States and Korea? Answer: I think it is an alliance. Kwak Dong-kyu Moon: Is the fact that the suspect stated that he used the notebook (Lenovo) alone in the suspect's residence? Answer: Yes. There is a fact that said. I am using my laptop at home. I have set the password so I can not use my parents or even my brother. Kwak Dong-kyu Moon: Just before the arrest of the suspect in the residence of the suspect, did the suspect know that he had executed a seizure search warrant at the Cyber Investigation Department of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Department and checked the notebooks used by the suspect? Answer: Yes. I know what I have checked about the laptop I was using at the Cyber Crime Department of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency. Kim Young-rae Moon: The suspect clearly stated that he used the notebook alone (Lenovo)? Answer: Yes, yes. Kim Young-rae Moon: July 7, 2015. The original text of the intimidating statement about raping the US President Obama's daughter was posted on the White House post. However, according to the cyber criminal investigation center of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, about one minute later, the suspect discovered that the file was saved as 'isis.png' in the M / Bureau / to folder at the bottom of the Document and Setting folder of the suspect, Did not upload the post above? Answer: The OS (Operating System) that was laid on my laptop is in France time zone. If you check it, there will be time difference. I can clearly see that it is not my post based on time difference. At this time, I stopped the investigation for dinner. (Investigators gather together to talk in a heated expression.) Kwak Dong-kyu Q: Is this statement true? Answer: Yes. Kwak Dong-kyu Moon: Do you have any more to say? Answer: I will leave it at the time of two times. (Although the suspect said, ""No,"" the lawyer Park Chul-hyun, who was sitting there, wrote the suspect as it was written.) Second round At this time, we show one newspaper report to the accused, Kim Young-rae Q: Are the contents of the one-time statement all right? A: Yes, all right. At this time, under the participation of lawyer Park Cheol-hyun, Kim Young-rae Moon: Detention of the suspect's residence One laptop in the study room, one desktop in the suspect's room (with two computer hard disks, one hard disk next to it), Desktop 1 in the library There was a discovery, and try to make statements about the purpose of each computer use. A: Lenovo, which was kept in the study room, is used by myself only for French study and internet connection. I use the desktop in the room where I sleep, I am not using it because of a computer failure due to a computer breakdown in 2013, and I use the desktop in the library sometimes for the purpose of searching the Internet and it is a computer that my parents use mainly. Kim Young-rae Moon: Lenovo (s / n: WB09564311), a notebook found in a suspect's residence, is used only by suspects. When did you use the above computer? A: After the desktop computer crashed around 2013, I bought it on the Internet and used it myself. Kim Young-rae Moon: I have been told that I want to access the Internet. Answer: I am mainly visiting [4Chan.org](URL and the Google blog I run. At this time, July 20, 2015, the investigation report (suspects found in the OO computer, the original capture file) isis.png, usa.png file shows the output to the suspect. Nam Sang-wook Moon, Sang-wook Moon, July 14, 2015 In the Digital Evidence Analysis Center of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, the computer analysis program Encase was used to generate the suspect notebook hard disk as a separate imaging file, As a result of the investigation, it was found in the isis.png and usa.png files found on the suspect's notebook that the US President threatened to rape Obama's daughter and threatened to terrorize US Ambassador Ripper, This is a picture file that you capture. Answer: I mainly visit [4Chan.org](URL and I do not know exactly whether I have read, captured, downloaded, correctly captured or downloaded the posts posted on the above site. (The suspect was suspicious of Google image search in addition to 4Chan, where he investigated the definition and difference of the capture and the download.) The suspect considers the capture and download to be mixed and writes mixed, and the investigator catches the pod This was not recorded in the record.) Nam Sang-wook Q: What capture program did you usually use? Answer: I use the capture program which is an extension of Google web browser. (The investigator asked for the name of the capture program.) The suspect wrote four or six capture programs from Google search and said they did not know the name of each one. (The investigator asked how long it took to write, and stated that the suspect took two to six hours.) Nam Sang-wook Q: How do I capture it? A: When you look at the Google web browser, you will see a 'camera' icon at the top of your web browser. Click on the icon to capture all the screens you see in your web browser. Nam Sang-wook: Do you use any extensions to save what path to save when capturing? Answer: I can specify the storage path arbitrarily, and I usually save a lot on the desktop, and use the png file extension. The png file format is mainly used because the picture quality is clear. Nam Sang-wook Q: Do not you use another capture program? Answer: I use some other programs, but the Google Chrome browser has a convenient capture function. Nam Sang-wook Q: What kind of website is [4Chan.org](URL A: There are many different kinds of articles posted. I mainly read political and sexual writings. Nam Sang-wook Q: What is sexual content? Answer: The most exciting thing I have seen recently is that a woman is pissing. Nam Sang-wook Q: What information do the suspects post on the site? A: I do not post articles like YAHAN video, but I am posting mostly political content in Korea. (The suspect posted the same thing on the blog as well, with about 2 postings in English, like 4Chan.) Nam Sang-wook Q: I will check back isis.png, usa.png. (The investigator showed me the file again.) Did you download the above file or capture it? Answer: I read the above picture again and got it. Nam Sang-wook Moon: July 13, 2015 When we confiscated the seizure, we told our investigator that the above file was captured. And in the previous statement, I stated that I did not know whether I was downloading or capturing. Why am I clarifying again that I have downloaded the statement again? Answer: The photographer showed the photo size of the photo file today. And yesterday, I said capture and download are mixed, so I just say capture. I did not even read the above photo on the 13th. Nam Sang-wook Moon: 2015. 7.13. At the time of the seizure, the cyber criminal investigator of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Department asked me several times to check the above photo. Answer: Yes. Requested. Nam Sang-wook Moon: But why did not you read it? Answer: I was lying because I was bored. Nam Sang-wook Moon: I was searching for confiscation. A: I did not want to get up because I was still sleeping while I was drinking. Nam Sang-wook Moon: At the end of the seizure search, you saw the picture of the manuscript (White House photo) through your mother and mother. Answer: I confirmed the picture, but it was not the above picture. (The suspect clearly remembered the pictures stored on his mother's cell phone, but it was not 4chan.) Nam Sang-wook Q: How do I download picture files from the Internet? Answer: When you right-click, there is a download button, which is downloaded by pressing the button above. The save path is mainly saved on the desktop, and sometimes the file name is changed or not. Nam Sang-wook Q: Why am I changing the file name? Answer: If you do not normally change it, but the file name is too long or the file name contains special characters, change the file name. Nam Sang-wook Q: What do you usually name the file name? Answer: There is no reason to change the actual filename when downloading. However, if the filename is too long, it is difficult to keep it on my computer and change the filename. (The statement ""It is difficult to identify"" in the statement is written by the investigator as it is intended.) The suspect stated ""I do not change the name to make it easier to identify. Nam Sang-wook: Do you save the file name with a special name when saving? A: If the file name is long, cut off the last part of the file name, or select the whole file name and save it as short name with no meaning. Nam Sang-wook Moon: When the suspect downloaded the photo file from the internet, he said that he would save the file as randomly. How was the original text file named ""isis"" and ""usa"" Answer: I do not know isis.png and usa.png is my favorite word. (The suspect has demonstrated to the investigators and lawyers the possibility of entering the isis via the keyboard location, but the investigator noted that he was not sure.) Nam Sang-wook Q: How was the email address used to write the Obama intimidation 'isshufs@gmail.com'? How did the suspect save the file and save the file as 'isis'? A: I think Iss and Isis are different. &amp;#x200B;"

Also, the time for the obsession for Obama to be posted on the US White House website is around July 7, 20:20, and the article on the reporter is scheduled for July 8, 2012, It's possible. Serial Number / Content / Time / Time Difference 1 / Time Obama Obscene Writes to the White House / June 1, 2015. 7. 20:20 / about 1 minute 2 / The Obama intimidating text was created and saved on the suspect computer / July 20, 2015 3 / Repert Thousand Times posted on the White House / Jul. 8, 2015 / about 1 minute 4 / Time of the protest manuscript created and saved on the suspect computer / June 8, 2015 The suspect stated that he had downloaded and stored the contents posted on the Internet to the suspect computer. Did he / she read the threat on the Internet and stored it on the victim's computer as soon as it was posted on the White House? Answer: My computer is set to French time zone and [4Chan.org](URL site is US site, so there will be time error. (The suspect had misunderstood [4Chan.org](URL as a US site, according to Wikipedia, [4Chan.org](URL is a Japanese site.) Nam Sang-wook Q: The suspect laptops are set up with OS operating system in French language and the time zone is also based on Paris time. So, there is -7 hour time difference with Korea. However, when analyzing with the Encase analysis program used by the investigation agency, it is possible to clearly see the time generated and the modified time by changing the above French time zone to the domestic time zone, and thus the above generation time is the domestic time. At this time, the suspect is shown the access time of the isis.png file, and it is arbitrary. As a result, the cyber criminal investigation center on July 13, 2015 will try to access the above file. Therefore, the above access time will be indicated on July 13, 2015. In conclusion, the time that was created on the suspect computer was the Korean time. So, as in the previous question, is someone reading a post in the White House in just one minute and storing it on the suspect computer, and can this behavior be repeated twice? At this time, the FBI requests the suspect and displays the text and time information sent by the FBI. Answer: I do not know. Nam Sang-wook Q: Is it possible to do the above work in just one minute? A: It will not be possible in a minute. Nam Sang-wook Q: If the suspect thinks it is not possible, is the suspect posted? Answer: If it is possible, I think that it is impossible if it can be done by myself and it is impossible. Nam Sang - wook, who had heard the statement, was staring at him for a long time with a very questionable look. Nam Sang-wook: So the suspect is monitoring the White House intimidation posts posted by others in near real time, then checking them and storing them on the victim's computer? A: You have not monitored it in real time. There is no such ability. (Here, 'real-time monitoring' refers to reading a new article updated in real time by accessing the White House site.) Nam Sang-wook Q: What type of web browser do suspects use when accessing the Internet? A: I am using a Google Chrome browser. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Is the fact that the suspect accessed the White House website? Answer: I have never been connected. At this time, the picture file 'screencapture-www-whitehouse-gov-thank-you-1436290042624.png' attached to the White House homepage written by the suspect computer is displayed. Nam Sang-wook: If you look at the above picture file found on the suspect computer, it is the screen capture of the homepage of the US White House and it starts with ""Thank you for contacting the White House"". It is confirmed that the captured file is captured directly from the suspect computer through Capture, an extension function of the Google Chrome web browser. Is it true that you have written the article by accessing the White House website? ? Answer: I downloaded the picture file with the above file name. Nam Sang-wook: If you check the date and time of creation of the above capture file, you will be notified of the date and time (June 8, 2015, 2015) The same is true. After the complainant wrote the reputation, did not the output screen of the completion of the caption be captured on the suspect computer using the extension function of the Google Chrome browser and saved? A: I do not know this. At this time, July 20, 2015, the investigation report (4Chan and 4Chan about the posted on the backup site) shows the picture file attached to the optional. Nam Sang-wook Moon: The suspect stated that he had downloaded the above picture file on the [4Chan.org](URL website by referring to Repert's intimidation article. It is about 02:31. And the time of the above threat pictures on the suspect computer is around July 8, 2015. How can the time saved on the suspect computer be faster than the time posted on the [4Chan.org](URL site? Answer: I do not know. Nam Sang-wook: Did not the suspect write the blackmail and post it on [4Chan.org](URL A: Not so. I have a problem with my computer and I have some malicious code. At this time, the text file s.txt found on the suspect computer is displayed to the suspect and attached to the end of this document. Nam Sang-wook: If you look at the date of creation of the above text file, the file creation date is around April 10, 2014, 16:59. If you look at the contents, you can see the email 'isshufs@gmail.com' ""I will kill Ambassador Ripper by penetrating the US embassy in Korean,"" ""Obama will kidnap a small daughter and rape my anus"", and the Twitter address listed in the intimidated article ""[URL 'And a text file of the Obama intimidation text was found. When and why did you write the above sentence? Answer: I do not know. Nam Sang-wook: Did you post the threats in the White House with the above phrase written in English? A: I have not. At this time, the photo files found on the suspect computer are shown as 1.jpg, 14.jpg, 10.jpg, 8.jpg, 4.jpg, 2.jpg, 1.jpg, 18.jpg, 5oe254mvhpke.jpg . Nam Sang-wook Q: The above file access time is around Jul. 7, 21:28. In the above photo, Repert was threatened with terrorism by Kim Ki-jong, Kim Kyeong-jong and Obama, and the time for the reporter and Obama to be intimidated by the intimidation was reached on July 7, 2015. You read a picture of the aptitude episode, right? Answer: It's what I saw because it was stored in my folder. However, I did not write intimidation article. Nam Sang-wook Moon: The threat pictures stored on the suspect computer were created on the suspect computer on March 6, 2015. For some reason, all the threat pictures were uploaded on July 7, Did you read it? A: It seems that all files are accessed at that time while the folder is being organized, and the access time has changed. Nam Sang-wook: Unfortunately, Obama and Reporter's threats were posted on the White House on July 7, 2015. A: I do not know that. At this time, July 27, 2015, the investigation report (for the search warrant application for), attached to the \[Foreign Foreign Ministry, the Foreign Ministry confirmed the article on the page\] is shown, Nam Sang-wook Q: In the above article, I used 'email [summer@hufs.ac.kr](mailto:summer@hufs.ac.kr)' using ip [124.197.152.111](URL on July 7, I do not know if this is the case. For reference, the above IP address 124.197.152 is the IP address of the defendant's residence. Because the suspect is a floating IP, the last number can change each time. A: I did not post it. Nam Sang-wook Q: Then who posted it? Answer: I do not know. Nam Sang-wook Q: I'm sure you posted the above article in the suspect's IP band. Do you really not know? A: I do not remember. Nam Sang-wook: When you click the url link posted on the above article, the internet address [URL is verified. If you connect to the above url, 'isshufs @ gmail. com 'e-mail is being written to' [isshufs@gmail.com](mailto:isshufs@gmail.com) 'Do not you know? At this time, please attach [URL url link printout at the end of this document. Answer: I do not know. I can not remember. Nam Sang-wook: 'isshufs@gmail.com' is listed in the s.txt file found on the suspect computer. A: I do not remember. Nam Sang-wook Moon: The e-mail address 'isshufs@gmail.com' is an email used to write a blackmail message to Obama. It is also stored in the s.txt file that the suspect is kept in. Is it listed on the site? A: When I do a search on Google, it looks like it came with me. Nam Sang-wook Q: Did you say you do not remember the previous statement? Answer: It is regretful to say that it is the reversal of the statement though it is the human being because it is a human being. (The statements of these suspects were recorded without further ado.) Since then, the suspect has been suffering from the mental pressure of a reversal of the statement until he is released from jail and jailed. Nam Sang-wook Q: Does the suspect mislead him? Answer: I have never posted a blackmail. Nam Sang-wook Moon: July 14, 2015. During the arrest, is it true that you threw objects at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Department Cybercrime and Ward staff? Answer: Yes. Nam Sang-wook Moon: What did you throw at? Answer: It's called a cold pack. (A cold pack is an ice pack.) After drinking, I was lying on my forehead with a cold pack with a headache. Nam Sang-wook Moon: What did you say? A: I can not remember what kind of profanity I have specifically done. Kwak Dong-kyu Moon: I think the investigator remembered that he had been saying, ""Hey, these bastards."" Is that right? (This investigator refers to Kwak Dong - gyu who is accompanied by Nam Sang - wook.) Kwak Dong - kyu intervened and questioned. Answer: I can not remember whether I used the word ""bastard"" or how many times I used it. (The suspect stated that he did not use the word ""bastard"" but wrote that he did not remember.) Nam Sang-wook Moon: I came to the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency's Metropolitan Police Department and lie on the floor of the office to say, ""Bring a wheelchair,"" ""Get an executive chair."" Answer: I was drunk and drunken. Nam Sang-wook Moon: You were wearing only panties at the time of arrest? Answer: Yes, yes. Nam Sang-wook Moon: At the time of the arrest, the investigator of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Department (wearing a walker at the time of the investigation of Choi Sung-sik in the investigation team and stepping on the suspect's neck in the process of cuffing him) You did not wear it? Answer: Yes, I did not wear it. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Who wore the clothes? Answer: The investigator put on the clothe. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Why did you continue to do such an action during your arrest or office? A: I feel like I am excited. (Dozens of people came to the house of the suspect and suddenly arrested and was excited). Nam Sang-wook Moon: Seizure Search You have not lived in bed for about five hours, did you? A: I do not remember the exact time, but it did not happen. Nam Sang-wook Moon: In the blog ([helpkorea.blogspot.kr](URL of Nam Sang-wook, there is an article called 'How to Make Money from the Internet (Acquisition of Foreign Currency)'. Why did you write this article? Answer: I wrote for the sake of women. Nam Sang-wook Moon: In the above [helpkorea.blogspot.kr](URL there is an article entitled ""My Ministry of Defense Civilization"". When I look at the contents of the article, ""Ji Sung-woo calls me as a laundry hanger, I have been shaken 20 times and then I have been ejaculated in the anus. ""Is this true? Answer: Yes, yes. Nam Sang-wook Q: Do you have any bad memories about anus? A: I think it is a gag, not a bad memory. Nam Sang-wook: Do you think that Obama's anus is also a gag and raped an anus? A: I have not. Nam Sang-wook Moon: In the suspect blog ([fuckingkorean.blogspot.kr](URL I posted the diploma, transcript, graduation certificate and transcript of the suspect under the heading 'SSUL' I have lost my job because I have changed my minor in chemistry unilaterally without prior notice in the university. I have also been suspected of having my own academic background, personal credit, and suffered mental harm from my job as a freelance worker. ""Do you have a strong dissatisfaction with foreign language classes? Answer: Yes. I have a complaint. (Although the suspect did not use the word ""strong"", the investigator Kwak Dong-kyu of the next place repeatedly replied the suspect's answer and continued to write ""strong dissatisfaction."" Although the suspect pointed out, A suspect asked for removal and dragged two lines and interrupted him.) Nam Sang-wook Moon: In the blog ([unicefusa.blogspot.kr](URL of Nam Sang-wook, a photograph of a woman wearing only panties and wearing clothes on her head with a pan on her head and expressing her nickname """" Is the suspect posted? (In addition to this question, the investigator changed from time to time during the investigation, but the record did not record the names of the investigators who questioned.) Answer: Yes. I posted it. Nam Sang-wook Q: Why did you post this picture? Answer: I posted it for fun. Nam Sang-wook Q: Did you try to get sponsorship by inserting the account number of the suspect in the photo of only the underwear? Answer: Yes, yes. Nam Sang-wook Q: How much did you sponsor so far? Answer: I got 20,000 won. Nam Sang-wook Moon: What did you use when you used the word ""shit-chill"" on the wall? A: I do not remember. Nam Sang-wook Moon: This is a reporter and Obama intimidation article. The e-mail address is' [isshufs@gmail.com](mailto:isshufs@gmail.com) ', which is used by the staff of Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. The phone number is' 82 02 2173 2062 ', and the address is Hankook University of Foreign Studies. For what reasons did the person who wrote the above article write the address, phone number, and e-mail of Hankuk University of Foreign Studies? A: This is a common address. Nam Sang-wook Moon: As far as I think, I think that a person with a strong dissatisfaction with foreign languages would have written a threatening statement. What is the opinion of the suspect? A: I think it would have been written by a person who is dissatisfied with foreign language. Nam Sang-wook Moon: And if you look at the content of the intimidation article, it says ""I'm HUFS student from Seoul, Korea"". Answer: Yes, yes. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Did you graduate from a foreign language college and post the above content in a blackmail message like this? Answer: I would have used the word undergraduated instead of student. Nam Sang-wook Moon: And both the intimidation against Obama and the intimidation about reporter had strong complaints about foreign universities by writing emails, phone numbers, and addresses of foreign university staff, Do you think that the person who wrote this threat letter impersonated foreign language group like this? A: The same person has written two intimidating documents and is probably one of the students at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. Nam Sang-wook Q: What is the name of the second daughter Obama and the name of the first daughter? Answer: The second daughter's name is Natasha, and I know that the first daughter's name does not know exactly and ends in. (The investigator showed the name on the intimidating document and asked the investigator the additional information that the suspect had learned, and he did not record it in the dossier when he said that the suspect had ""the document the investigator showed."" A lawyer Park Chul Hyun was silent. Nam Sang-wook Moon: I did not know the name of the first daughter and knew exactly the name of the second daughter. A: I do not remember that. Nam Sang-wook Q: Does the suspect want to be famous? A: I want to be a successful person rather than a famous person. Kim Young-rae Moon, July 13, 2015. 13. Seized at the time of the seizure. We told our investigator (Kim Young Rae), ""It seems to be famous."" Answer: Yes, yes. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Obama said, ""I decided to become a famous Korean man in the US today."" Did he decide to become a famous person? A: What I'm saying is that I am a politician and a famous person, not a serial killer. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Have you ever thought about serial killers? A: I've never thought about it before. Nam Sang-wook Q: When is the suspect mainly used on the computer? Answer: The time zone is not set, but we use it at night or early morning. Nam Sang-wook Moon: The time of Obama's intimidation was 20:20 and the reporter's intent was written at 02:26. Is it a time zone where the suspect mainly uses computers (more than 50%)? Answer: Yes, yes. Nam Sang-wook: Do you have evidence or statements that are favorable to the suspect? A: I will submit it later. Nam Sang-wook: Do you have any more to say? A: If you look at the contents of my blog about the referent, you can see that it is contrary to the police claim. Please disclose specific details about the IP band. (After consulting the attorney Park Cheol-hyun who joined the investigation and the suspect's first and second journals, they come to the newspaper) Nam Sang-wook Q: Are all the statements stated in the previous meeting true? Answer: None of the statements made in the previous survey are true. Nam Sang-wook: Do you have statements that differ from those of the suspect? Answer: Not at all. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Does the suspect know the current arrest warrant? A: Yes, I know. Nam Sang-wook Q: What do you think about the arrest warrant for the suspect's crime charges? A: I think it is wrong. Nam Sang-wook Moon: What is wrong with you? A: I did not intend to harm the US President Young-ae, and I did not intend to risk the riper Foreign Ambassador. Nam Sang-wook: Do you mean that in the case of the suspect, there was nothing wrong with you and you were unjustly arrested? Answer: Yes, yes. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Does that mean that the judge and the investigating agency are wrong? Answer: Yes, yes. Nam Sang-wook: Does the suspect mean that the evidence that the investigative agency can not trust? A: Yes, I can not trust the evidence presented by the police. Nam Sang-wook Moon: The evidence presented by the police is an objectively obtained data from cyber police officers who are experts in the computer field. A: I do not know exactly what part it is. Nam Sang-wook Q: What do you mean by not knowing exactly what part you are? A: I am not a computer expert or a forensic examiner. Nam Sang-wook Q: Is not the suspect a computer engineer? A: Digital and computer engineering are different. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Which part is different? A: The paper I wrote when I graduated is about sound, about digital signals, and computer engineering is about the computer itself. Nam Sang-wook: Did not the suspect claim to have a knowledgeable knowledge of the computer in the statement before? A: Yes, it is true. Nam Sang-wook: In conclusion, you do not trust the police evidence? Answer: There is no partial trust. Nam Sang-wook Q: Do you mean that there is another part that you can trust that the part is not trusting? Answer: ENCAEC Time-lapse analysis is reliable. (A cybercriminal investigator, a computer expert, continues to spell the ENCASE program incorrectly as ENCAEC, which is one of the reasons for the lack of confidence in the investigation.) At this time, the suspect suddenly says that he can not trust the program to analyze ENCAEC parallax. The suspect described ""trust"", but the investigator wrote that the suspect's statement was heard as gibberish. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Do you mean to trust the ENCAEC program that the evidence that analyzed the time lapse of the threatening posting presented by the police as evidence is correct? Answer: Yes, yes. Nam Sang-wook Moon: The suspect clearly said he trusted the ENCAEC program. In the previous statement, I stated that the operating system (OS) laid down in the suspect's laptop was in French time zone and that it would be possible to find out by observing the time difference. Why did you say so? Answer: I heard that the Cyber Police officer explained. (The suspect believed so because he trusted the explanation of the computer expert.) Nam Sang-wook Moon: Do not you mean that when you interpret the current suspect's statement, the suspect posted a post that intimidates President Obama? Answer: I just want to trust the cyber-forensic investigation technique. Nam Sang-wook Q: If you have confidence in cyber-forensic investigation, you should trust the evidence presented by cyber-police. Answer: I have a part that I do not understand. The first is the way Porter operates. The way PORCHAN works is, in short, a real-time posting like a daily best. The second is Google search engine exposure time. That means the post is not deleted right away, but exists on the Internet for some time. Nam Sang-wook Q: What does it mean to have confidence in cyber-investigation techniques and how to operate Pocan? Answer: I trust cyber forensic techniques, but the ENCAEC program is poor. Porter and Google also want to apply cyber-forensic investigation techniques to Porter and Google. Nam Sang-wook: So, if the objection is not clear and the ENCAEC program is objectively clear about the operation of Pocan or Google, as the suspect claims, how would you accept it? A: I will acknowledge you if you disclose the truth in a public authority. Nam Sang-wook Q: If the ENCAEC program or cybercriminals in a reputable institution has no problem with the evidence, would you say that you would admit the suspect's allegations? Answer: You are acknowledging the credible result, not the accusation. I have never written or wrote the article. Nam Sang-wook: If you have been verified by a reputable institution, would not it be the objective evidence to refute the statement even if the accused claims no? Answer: It is objective evidence that we want you to investigate enough evidence. (The above questions are typical guidance questions.)

Answer: I first consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the changes I made at the foreign language school. (The suspect responded to the Ministry of Education complaints and sent the evidence documents to Yongmin Kim after the bail was released.) There is. I am not trying to hate the outside world. Jung Guk Moon: The police officer acknowledged that he had read the picture file (castration.png, hufs.png) that he viewed on his computer before the crime, S.TXT file ""denies the fact that the suspect has been denied the fact that the suspect has denied all the crimes related to the crime. Answer: Not. Rather, I think that picture files and text files should be replaced. The reason for this is that I have read more of the text file because I have stored various contents in the text file. (The suspect has limitations in remembering a lot of computer usage history.) Jung Guk Moon: The suspect stated that the police use the Google Chrome browser when accessing the Internet, and many of the files on the victim's laptop that captured the White House homepage using the Google Chrome browser were found. A: It's not a capture, it's a download. Jung Guk Q: A capture file (screencapture-www-whitehouse-gov-contact-submit-auestions-and-comments-1432397652564.png) found on the suspect computer is a file captured using a Google Chrome browser, 'Www-whitehouse-gov-contact-submit-auestions-and-comments' consists of the URL address of the captured website and the last 13 digits '1432397652564' Is the time information used by the Unix operating system and can be converted to UTC + 9 using a time conversion program (DCode) to check the captured time. Answer: I searched on Google and received the download as it is.

It is confirmed that it is written, is not it that the suspect wrote it directly and captured it? Figure 1 shows the date and time the capture file was saved on the computer, and the date and time when the web page was captured, respectively. Answer: No. Jung Guk Q: If the suspect downloads the above capture file from the Internet, the captured date and time can not be the same as the captured date on the computer, and the storage date and time must be later than the capture time. Answer: I think there are various possibilities for that. The possibilities are Google Cache, which I think goes beyond what I can explain. Jung Guk Moon: 1) The s.txt file is created on 1) 2014. 9. 10. 16:59 and the above s.txt file will be uploaded to the suspect's notebook (1) ""I will kill Ripper Ambassador, Obama will kidnap my little daughter to rape my anus"", and (2) I posted it on the intimidating article. Is 'isshufs@gmail.com, [summer@hufs.ac.kr](mailto:summer@hufs.ac.kr)' showing the account? (I repeat the same question as the third investigator.)

(It is true that the accused got to know the police explanation). Jung Guk Moon: The suspect wrote that he did not write the article himself, he saw the article posted on 4chan site, and then retrieved it by searching Google. In order to make the excuse of the suspect correct, However, since digital analysis of the time of generation of related files shows that the time of file creation is 4chan posting after storing the suspect notebook, why do you think the suspect's claim is unfounded? A: Because I am not doing digital analysis, I can not give a definite answer about it. (The suspect did not do a Google search after seeing 4chan's article.)

(The investigator said that he described the suspect as ""poor."") Three times At this time, the lawyer Park Chul - hyun participates in the discussion with arbitrary participation. (At the time of the police investigation, the investigators were instructed by a messenger program installed on the computer used for cell phone and dossier to ask questions in real time with the investigators outside the investigation room. ) At this time, the suspects and lawyers will show the 7th report on July 15, 2015 (the suspect confirms the setting of the OO notebook time zone setting) Nam Sang-wook: Even if the suspect laptops are set in French time zone, if the computer analysis program Encase is converted into domestic time, the creation date of the file and the access date can all be confirmed by the national standard time.

Answer: Yes. I understood and acknowledged the contents that the investigator showed directly. (Not many people watch the posted time zone while writing on the Internet.) At this time, I show an investigation report (analysis of the Google Chrome browser capture function and analysis of the writing screen of the website of the US White House). Nam Sang-wook: The following five files found on the suspect's notebook are generated by capturing directly from the suspect's laptop through the Google Chrome browser, and seencapture-www-whitehouse-gov-contact-submit- comments-1432397652564.png and seencapture-www-whitehouse-gov-contact-submit-questions-and-comments-1432397921271.png files will be posted on the White House website on May 5, 2015 at 01:14 and 01:17 The 13-digit number that is displayed next to the capture file name is the same as the generation time of the generated file, and the above 13-digit number is the time information that is automatically generated when capturing from Google Chrome. The time of the capture file created on the notebook is the same as the date and time of capture, so that if the suspect is downloaded from the Internet, Seen from the above that there's time to capture capture program may be the same, there is confirmation that the suspect has written articles connected directly to the White House website, is not that a suspect directly after article creation, capture? (The investigator attached the Encase analysis screen to the dossier.) This long question is not a question asking the suspect's answer.) A: I do not know who did it. It is not me who wrote.

(The suspect responded only to 'yes' or' no ', depending on the investigators' enforcement.) The accused continues to write notes on A4 paper notes. (The note used by the suspect at the time of the investigation was written by Park Cheol-hyeon, the lawyer, who told the suspect that he was ""unable to carry the paper in the custody"") and each time the investigation was completed, he took the suspect's note and handed it to the investigators.

The next-door investigator said,"" Let's go with Ambassador Ripper. "" ""And the accused replied,"" It is an honor to have inspired Ripper's thoughts. ""These statements were not recorded at all. Nam Sang-wook Moon: If you look at the photos of threats detected on the suspect computer, the file creation date and time will be all around June 3, 2015, and the last access date will be 6.8 to 6.6.

(Normally, the suspect's drinking habit is to drink beer while watching TV on the other side of the room, and drink alcohol when the alcohol is weak.) The suspect is used to study the notebook by blowing it, not to drink alcohol. Because the study room where the notebook is located is so hateful that it gets dirty with drinking alcohol, it never drinks in the study room, and it often witnesses the families of suspects.)

Nam Sang-wook Moon: In the room where the suspect was sleeping, several masks were found, and for what purpose did he bring them? Answer: I bought two from the domestic Internet site for use as a toy. (The investigator did not record the statement in the memorandum that the suspects ""bought the same toy when buying a product on the Internet and trying to meet the shipping reduction conditions."") Nam Sang-wook Moon: How do you use a mask as a toy? A: I had fun with two mothers of relatives on the New Year's Day. Nam Sang-wook Q: Is not that what you bought to use? A: I have an intention to write and play. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Is it fun to play in the sun? Answer: Not written. (The suspect stated in the sense of ""I have never written a mask since purchasing it."") Nam Sang-wook Moon: What type of mask is it? Answer: Eyes are white circles, nostrils and mouth are small masks. Nam Sang-wook Moon: This mask is the mask of the famous hacker group Ananimus? Answer: No. Nam Sang-wook Q: How is it not?

Nam Sang-wook Q: In what way do you think like this? Answer: I know there is no evidence in Yang medicine. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Do not you trust TCM? Answer: I do not trust. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Obama's family intimidation article says ""I eat Kimchi and I am safe from AIDS."" What do you think about the above? A: I think it is bullshit.

Answer: There are several IDs such as [helpmeusacom@gmail.com](mailto:helpmeusacom@gmail.com). Domestic mail is not used. (The suspect has Naver and the next ID that he does not use.) Nam Sang-wook Q: Why do you use overseas email only? Answer: To use the Google blog, Naver and the next time I post my article because the blog is blocked. Nam Sang-wook Q: What kind of content does this block? Answer: Political writings (such as writings about women) block themselves. Nam Sang-wook: Are you interested in politics as usual?

Answer: No. Not once. Nam Sang-wook Q: Who knows your notebook password? Answer: I know only. Nam Sang-wook Q: Why did I set a password on my laptop? Answer: I only use it for myself. Nam Sang-wook Q: What does the password mean? Answer: No meaning. (The suspect has demonstrated to the investigator that it is an easy location to press the index and stop on the keyboard.) At this time, we show the screen shot of the SuperHideIp program found on the suspect's laptop desktop to the suspect, and attach it at the end of this document. Nam Sang-wook Q: I have found a program that can hide the SuperHideIp IP on the suspect computer desktop. I analyzed the above program directly by Cybercrime, and it was easy to change my computer's IP with a mouse click. Why can I change it to U.S.IP when I connect to the internet in Korea? Why? Answer: I downloaded and installed it on the Internet. (The suspect was doing something just once after installation.) Nam Sang-wook Q: Is not it the intention to hide your IP? Answer: No. Nam Sang-wook Moon: I did not intend to hide. Why did you download it? Answer: I am interested in seeing the arrest news about IP trace, and got it downloaded. Nam Sang-wook Q: How did you find out that you have the above program? Answer: I learned from internet search. Nam Sang-wook Q: How exactly did you download it? Answer: I have downloaded the keyword ""ip change"" from Google and searched the web page, but I do not know which site I got it from. Nam Sang-wook Q: Why are you trying to hide IP? Answer: I do not know. Nam Sang-wook Q: Do you make statements that only a disadvantageous statement is ""I do not know""? A: In the news, I found that the police were arrested for tracking down the IP. (The suspect stumbled across KBS News, which reported this incident on a large television set in the Jongno police station detention center.) Nam Sang-wook Q: So, what kind of crime did you download? Answer: No. Nam Sang-wook Q: How many times have you tried this program? Answer: I installed Super Hide IP and tried it once after installation. Nam Sang-wook Q: How about running this program? Answer: It was executed with a single mouse click. I did not check whether the IP was changed, but I tried to execute it. Nam Sang-wook Q: Is it easy to change the IP? A: I think it depends on the person. Nam Sang-wook Moon: After we have run the above program, it is easy to operate with a single click of the mouse. We also say that the suspect is executed with a single mouse click on the statement. What does it mean by different people? Does it mean that clicking the mouse is difficult? Answer: It's easy to run, but I think there is a difference between people searching and finding them. To find the above IP change program, it means that no one can find and search well. Nam Sang-wook: Do the suspects ultimately have the ability to find programs that can change the IP? Answer: I accidentally found it. Nam Sang-wook Q: Anyway, you entered your keyword directly into Google search, and you actively found it? Answer: No. Nam Sang-wook Moon: In the previous statement, why did you say that you searched for a program by entering keywords directly, and now you accidentally found it accidentally? Answer: It is not a reversal of a statement. Superhideip is a coincidence that I clicked one of the tens of thousands of search results in the search result called IP change. (At this time, a police officer Kwak Dong-gyu was sitting beside Nam Sang-wook's investigator and asked him, ""Who did you coach?"" Kwak Dong-gyu, as an investigator in the first and second police investigations, I asked him with a smile, ""OO, is there something wrong with your mind?"" Why did you do that? ""But when the investigator did not go as planned, he started to press it like this. Nam Sang-wook Q: Did you spend a lot of time looking for the above program? A: I do not know that. (A suspect could not remember because there were a huge number of suspects who searched the Internet from time to time.) Nam Sang-wook Q: Do you think the suspects search ability is good? A: I do not think so. (The suspect stated ""I do not have an internet search ability certificate"". At this time, take a break for a while. (At this time, police officers from the police department gathered to discuss the next question.) (At the time of the investigation, an older investigator (Kim Jin-kwang) said to Nam Sang-wook, ""Do you have to turn on your laptop?"" Nam Sang-wook said, ""I need to turn on my laptop to run VMware."" The investigator said to Nam Sang-wook, ""Then think carefully and turn on the notebook!"" Nam Sang-wook went upstairs, and again, from the next investigation, Nam Sang-wook questioned me about the female anatomical image. I guess Nam Sang-wook went to the second floor and manipulated the laptop. Nam Sang-wook Q: I checked the information on cybercrime today with the above IP change program. Answer: It seems easy to double-click to run the program. Nam Sang-wook Q: What site did you access with the above program running and changing the IP? A: I do not remember. Nam Sang-wook Q: If you look at the date of installation of the above program, the date of the last access is June 6, 2015. When was the last date used? Answer: I used it once on the day of installation on July 16, 2014. At this time, show the observer's photo and picture file (filename: IP address washing method .jpg, any weblock readme.jpg) found on the suspect's notebook and attach it to the end of this article. Nam Sang-wook Moon: The picture file (IP address washing method .jpg) found on the suspect's notebook shows how to download and install the site detour access program which is blocked in Korea. Any weblock readme.jpg Explains how to block access to websites from your computer. Is it possible to keep the above files in order to access some blocked sites in Korea? A: You were not trying to connect to a blocked site. Nam Sang-wook Moon: How to Wash IP Address Above The .jpg file was created by the defendant's own editing program, right? A: I've captured and saved the results of searching for ""change my ip"" on Google. Nam Sang-wook Moon: The suspect has a lot of doubts about IP, asking him to check the IP posted on [4chan.org](URL According to recent cyber-investigation techniques, IP modulation is very easy, so you can not identify suspects with just one IP. Is not it because I suspect that the suspect has altered the IP or used other means of detouring? Answer: No. I did not know how to investigate, and I saw the arrest news through IP tracking. (The suspect did not ask for ""please confirm the IPs posted on [4chan.org](URL and asked for the IPs in the news article ""I traced the IPs."" Of course, There is a number.) Nam Sang-wook Q: There are many ways to change the IP. Answer: I do not know. Nam Sang-wook Q: What do you usually think about the United States? A: I am longing for the United States and working for US citizenship and green card. Nam Sang-wook Q: Is Obama Democratic or Republican? (The previous day, the suspect received a long-term investigation of the crime profile, which was not recorded in the memorandum separately from the police investigation. At this time, the suspect had stated that Obama was a Republican in a questionnaire with two crime psychology professors, When the investigator who was observing from the outside tried to search the internet, it was different from the fact, and the police investigation asked this question the next day. A: As far as I know, Republicans. (The suspect responded to the investigator after commenting in advance that the criminal psych profiler was a question yesterday, but the statement did not record this statement.) At this time, using a smartphone search through Wikipedia, Obama will show the suspect that he is a Democrat. Nam Sang-wook: Why did you think Obama was a Republican? A: I do not know about American politics. (The suspect stated ""not interested in American politics."" The suspect, when the investigator came to the conclusion, ""presumed Obama as a Republican because the northern United States, where the liberation of black slaves began, is the base of the Republican Party."" But did not record. Nam Sang-wook Q: Is Democratic Party more progressive than Republican Party? A: I do not know that. Nam Sang-wook Q: Do not you know that you are interested in politics? A: I do not know about American politics. (The accused stated that they are ""interested only in domestic politics."") Nam Sang-wook Q: What do you think about Obama? A: I think he is respected as the first black president in the United States. Nam Sang-wook Q: Is the image of a monkey synthesized by Obama and Michel synthesized by the suspect? Answer: No. Downloaded. (I suspect the suspect downloaded the 4chan watermark below the photo.) Nam Sang-wook Q: Where did you download the above file? Answer: I downloaded it from 4chan. (I suspect that the suspect downloaded the 4chan watermark below the photo and downloaded it from 4chan, but in some cases the source was downloaded from a non-4chan location because it was downloaded from Google's search results.) Nam Sang-wook Q: What is the above picture? A: This is a picture of Obama as a monkey. Nam Sang-wook Q: Why did you download Obama's image and say that he saved it on the suspect's computer? At this time, the suspect trims. (Because the suspect was unable to eat and sickness came up inside.) Answer: I have downloaded it in order to utilize the background of the person who made the picture above as a material for writing criticism. Nam Sang-wook Q: Did you write criticism on your blog? A: I would not have. I do not know for sure. (The suspect later downloaded the photo because he was going to write if he had time.) Nam Sang-wook Moon: I have a bad feeling about Obama. Did not I download the photo above? Answer: No. Nam Sang-wook Q: Is not it a fun thing to write because I have not written any articles? Answer: No. Nam Sang-wook Q: Is it fun to look at the pictures of Above Obama? Answer: Disgusting. Nam Sang-wook Moon: I told you that Obama's photographs are disgusting, but if you do not write related articles, should not you? Why did you keep it? Answer: I will use it later when I write again. (When the suspect tried to write, he kept it on his laptop because he could not find it on the internet.) Nam Sang-wook Q: What do you think about black people? A: I think that black people are the same person and call themselves black people themselves. (The suspect thought that the sword should be replaced with the word 'African American' with the word 'black', because it is a racist word.) Nam Sang-wook Moon: The suspect is very clear about the above question. What belief do you have about racism? A: Racial discrimination is an ideology by some white supremacists. This includes blacks and asians. Therefore, Koreans can also be victims of racial discrimination. Nam Sang-wook Q: Does the suspect think that I am logical and reasonable? Answer: I only believe in evidence as much as possible. Nam Sang-wook: By the way, why did you say you did not commit the crime while trusting all the results of computer digital evidence analysis? Answer: The superhidip is a bit less reliable. Nam Sang-wook Q: Even if you have a friendly feel for the US in general, can you think of it as bad for Obama? A: Because I work for US citizenship, I do not think separately. (The suspect described the police investigator as ""honoring Obama, the first black president,"" but did not record it.) Nam Sang-wook Q: Have you read a lot of articles about Obama? A: I have not read much. (The suspect had not read much of the article because he was not interested in American politics.) Nam Sang-wook Q: What do you think about Obama's attack on the terrorist group of is? A: The attack on the terrorist group is an absolute support. At this time, the suspect was found in the OO notebook. The brain was blurred, the woman was naked in the grass, the body was naked, the child was naked, the anus was opened with his fingers, , A picture of a child with a knife in his stomach, a picture of inserting a male penis into the anus, a picture of autopsy of the body's head and abdomen, a picture of the body's eye, a picture of the body's head, A photo of a woman showing her blood in her pussy, a photo of a woman showing a broken thorax, a picture of a woman's head being cut off, a picture of a woman's penis, a penis, Two men are fingers of a child's penis, a picture of a woman cutting her head in the body, a picture of a Korean flag in her bowel movement, a picture of her lower body cut off, A photograph of a woman's legs being cut off, a picture of a woman dropping blood, a picture of a man shaking a manpower in North Korea, a picture of Kim Jong Il, a picture of a witch in the body, a picture of Kim Jong Il with children , A photo of women wearing surgical gloves and a woman's anal opening, and showing them at the end of this paper. (The investigator tried to express the meaning of each photo in the blank space on page 591 as much as possible.) The suspect said, ""With this kind of investigation, If there is anyone passing by, it is a psycho pass. "" Nam Sang-wook Moon: A total of 35,438 picture files (extension jpg, png) were stored on the suspect computer. About one quarter of them were stored. As shown to the suspect, many female anus pictures and body pictures Why was the above picture file stored on the suspect computer? Answer: I was interested in death, so I downloaded the above photo, and the woman's anal photo was downloaded because it was porn. Nam Sang-wook, a cyber investigator who led the interrogation process from the third police investigation, said, ""I am guilty only by possession of the above photo file. I can add more charges that I did not prosecute."" He threatened the suspect to feel frightened, I went ahead.) Nam Sang-wook Q: Is the suspect file taken by the suspect himself? Answer: No. I downloaded it from the Internet. Nam Sang-wook Q: Where did you download the Internet? A: Google has searched the website for porn related words, and body pictures have also found and downloaded websites based on the results linked from the porn sites. (All the suspects could not remember.) Nam Sang-wook: How do you feel when you look at a photo file like this? Answer: I am not happy, but when I receive the AP Reuters communication at KBS, I get a lot of cruel pictures. So it seems that I became more interested in the above picture. Nam Sang-wook Q: Then, did you become interested in the above pictures while working at KBS? Answer: No. After leaving KBS, the pace began to change pessimistically. Nam Sang-wook Q: What does it mean to be pessimistic? A: I know Nietzsche is pitiful. At this time, (the investigator did not record ""Attorney Park Chul-Hyun""), I checked the dictionary of pitfalls with a smartphone and said ""I hate the world and see everything as dark and negative"" Show it to the suspect. (The lawyer Park Chul-hyeon, who has been silent, searches for his smartphone and handed his smartphone voluntarily even though the investigator did not ask for it. In the prosecution investigation, Park Cheol-hyeon counseled the suspect along with the prosecution attorney I stood in the position of. Nam Sang-wook Q: Is the above dictionary definition meaningful to the suspect? A: What I'm talking about is the content of a longing for death. Nam Sang-wook Q: So, did you post a statement to the Blue House about suicide? A: That was to insist my position for political purposes. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Have you ever tried to die? Answer: No. Nam Sang-wook Q: So what do you do about death? Answer: Yes, yes. Nam Sang-wook Q: I think it would be insulting to killing a person if I often see the above picture. What is the opinion of the suspect? (The cyber investigator, Nam Sang-wook, asked the cyber criminal investigation team to expand the scope of the investigation, and tried to prove the suspect's allegations until the murder of the US-based cyber criminal investigators. ) A: I do not know that. Nam Sang-wook Moon: For ordinary people, I do not think I will download unnecessary downloads to my computer even if I see pictures like this once or twice in curiosity. The reason why I downloaded and stored hundreds of such body photographs What is it? A: It's a habit to download. Nam Sang-wook Q: How do I download it? Answer: Click the right mouse button to save. Nam Sang-wook Q: Where do you store it? Answer: Save on your desktop. Nam Sang-wook Moon: Do not you be surprised when you see a picture of a body above a desktop? &amp;#x200B;"

A: I'm willing to take a lie detector test. Thank you. I received a request from the police investigation stage. (At the time of the police investigation, the suspect and Park Cheol-hyeon lawyer, only two people remain in the investigation room, Park Chul-hyun told the suspect, ""You can get a lie detector test."" After the investigation began, The suspect was asked to check the police's lie detector, and when the suspect made the handwritten statement at the prosecution's investigation, he used the expression ""requested"" ""I refused,"" the suspect said, ""I received a request from the police, but I will not fix it because I am not asking."") Finally, I think my blog post is wrong. (At the conclusion of all the blog posts of the suspect, the paragraph begins with ""I hope my thoughts are wrong anyway ..."" which emphasizes a neutral position on the topic.) Jung Guk Q: Are there any items that are not listed or different from the facts as stated in the memorandum? Answer: No. (The prosecutor investigated slowly when he started the investigation, but when the suspect became tired at the end, he launched a question.) Three times In the middle of the summer, the suspect was seated in a chair by a prosecutor, and after seeing his lawyer Park, he asked him to ""float the water."" Park Chul-hyun refused, ""I want you to eat it,"" and the suspect obtained the permission of the prosecutor's office and drank water. Park Cheol-hyeon came to the police station with a Mercedes Benz car and asked him more importantly about the location of the parking lot at the first meeting with the investigators. Park Cheol-hyun, who asked me to hand him over to the suspect's parents because he would not receive a bargaining fee of 3 million won, came in well, but in front of the suspect under investigation, The prosecutor's office was changed to a regular inspection. Jung Moon-sik Moon: (A regular checkup shows the analysis result and the isis.png picture file printed on A4 paper and tells the suspect, ""I am sorry that the picture is small."" And to exert pressure on the suspect, I gave up the two files.) \[Present the above isis.png file and analysis result (isis.png\_REPORT.txt) from the suspect's notebook.\] The above file came out of the suspect notebook. Have you ever seen it? Answer: I saved this file on my notebook. I searched this file on the internet, downloaded it and saved it on my laptop. I did a Google search. The source of this file from Google search results was not verified. At the time, I do not remember what I put my search terms into while doing a Google search. At that time, I do not remember what kind of search I was doing specifically. The file contains the phrase ""I am going to anal rape your second daughter Natasha."" However, I think you'll need to know how I searched for the file with that content. (The official testimony showed the intimidation to the suspect, and then recorded in the record, 'I am going to anal rape your second daughter Natasha.' Jung Moon-sik Q: When did you download the above file? Answer: It seems to have been downloaded from the middle of June 2015 until the day of my confiscation (May 13, 2015). Jung Moon-sik Statement: As a result of the above file analysis, the above file was created on July 7, 20:21. Is the suspect downloaded on the date above? Answer: (At this time, the suspect nods his head.) Yes, I had downloaded one time and remembered that it was downloaded in July, so I downloaded it on July 7, 20:21, (The suspect stated that he was studying French at 50:50 on the 7-8th day, or taking a sleep, but he recorded what the attorney understood.) Jung Moon-sik Moon: (A regular checkup shows the analysis results and the usa.png picture file printed on A4 paper and tells the suspect, ""I am sorry that the picture is small."" And to exert pressure on the suspect, (The file was found on the suspect's notebook.) The above file was presented on the suspect's notebook. Have you ever seen it? Answer: Yes, I have seen this file. I downloaded it through internet search and saved it on my laptop. I searched on Google. I do not remember which search terms I entered into Google, and I can not remember which sites I downloaded from Google search results. I do not remember the exact date and time when I searched for this file. I did not remember why I searched this file, and I searched for no reason. I do not remember entering the White House as my search term. I seem to have downloaded and saved this file at once with a file (isis.png file) containing the phrase 'I am going to anal rape your second daughter Natasha.' Jung Moon-sik Statement: As a result of the above file analysis, the above file was created on July 8, 2015 at 02:27. Is the suspect downloaded on the date above? A: I remember downloading this file (usa.png file) in July 2015. However, I do not remember exactly whether I downloaded it on July 8, 2015. Jung Moon-sik Moon: (The official test shows the file attribute picture file and the picture file of this file to the suspect who printed it on the A4 paper screencapture-www-whitehouse-gov-thank-you-1436290042624.png "" I had to copy this file to the computer on my computer, so the location of the file attribute would say ""check"", and I put on a stapler with an exaggerated gesture to pressurize the suspect. ) \[The above screencapture-www-whitehouse-gov-thank-you-1436290042624.png file from the suspect's notebook and presenting the file property output\] The above file came from the suspect's notebook. Have you ever seen it? Answer: I searched this file on the Internet, downloaded it and saved it on my laptop. I did a Google search. The source of this file, which comes from Google search results, is hard to remember. It's hard to remember what you put your search terms into while doing a Google search. I did not search for a specific purpose. Jung Moon-sik Q: When did you download the above file? A: I can not remember the exact date. It seems to have been downloaded from the middle of June, 2015 to the beginning of July, 2015. Jung Moon-sik Statement: As a result of the above file analysis, the above file appears to have been generated on July 8, 2015. Is the suspect downloaded on the date above?

Answer: The above castration.png file is a picture file I downloaded. I remember that I was downloaded from mid-June to 2015. 7. Cops. Castration means 'castration'. The above file is a scene of a movie. I can not remember being a movie with a lot of content. I guess I did not put the word ""castration"" into my query. Because it's about Google search results, I'm beyond the scope of what I'm describing. Jung Moon-sik Moon: (Record 675, 677, Representative Lim Seong-Kyung) What are the photo files? Answer: I searched for photos of Mr. Soo - kyung who showed me to use as a resource for criticism. I received a Google search and download. It is to criticize the main North Korean government. I store criticisms in my diary-style personal blog. I can not remember the exact date when I downloaded these files. In the material shown, the date and time of creation of these files is July 7, 2015. I think that the reason why the file creation date and time is analyzed as above dates is beyond the range that I can answer. I posted an article about Lim Soo Kyung in my blog ([antihufs.blogspot.kr](URL on July 7, 2015, and the above pictures are included in the article. That blog is still open. (It was impossible to remember all three or four thousand articles written by suspects.) At first, the suspect did not know what was on this blog. When the suspect said, ""It was between the middle of June and the beginning of July,"" the lawyer Park Chul-hyeon said, ""Why do you lie to the suspect? ? ""), And showed the date of the suspect's blog on his cell phone. The suspect responded that he saw his cell phone and posted it on July 7, 2015.) Jung Moon-sik: Does the suspect use a router when using a laptop? Answer: I have never written a program to change Internet IP, but I use a router. I purchased an internet router for 12,000 won ten years ago. Again, I can not remember exactly when I bought it. I have a router in my house, and I have 3 computers (my laptop, my desktop, my dad, and my computer are using that router). I use the router every time I use the internet. I have not changed my Router setting since I have never used it, but I have not changed my Router setting any more. When I use my Router, I enter ID (ADMIN) and Password (494) in the Router. I have not touched the case of the suspect. Jung Moon-sik Moon: Is there anything the suspect wants in the prosecution investigation process? A: Now that I have sealed my laptop, I did not break it. It is difficult to tell which part I should investigate because I am not an expert. (The prosecution extended the detention period of the suspects by 10 days in the name of investigating notebook hacks.) Jung Moon-sik Moon: Do you have any more to say? Answer: No. Jung Moon-sik Q: Are there any items that are not listed or different from the facts as stated in the memorandum? Answer: (handwritten entry) None. Four times At this time, the defendant is attending lawyer Park Cheol-hyeon attorney, saying that he will be investigated under the participation of counsel. Toward the suspect, (The official examination did not participate in the interrogation of the suspect, but did not record it in the prosecution dossier.)

Jung Guk Moon: The suspect described last time that he used the mobile phone of the suspect's mojo OO. Does he remember the cell phone number used by the suspect?

How is it? Answer: Yes. It is correct as I stated before. Jung Guk Moon: The suspect is on July 7, 2015, 20:20, 20:20. Is it the correct time to copy the text from the suspect computer and paste it into a text file? Answer: I do not know the exact time.

Jung Moon-sik Q: How about a detailed explanation of how the suspect copied and pasted the results of Internet search? A: I went into the internet and searched, but the search terms were hard to remember and I copied the search results and pasted them into a text file. Jung Moon-sik Q: How do I get the search result when I can not remember the search term? Answer: ... It's a bit difficult to identify the exact query. (The suspect searches a large number of search terms to find search results just like ordinary people, remembering only the search results, and not remembering what search terms you searched for.) Jung Moon-sik Moon: The suspects are [URL [jeolladian.blogspot.com](URL [jeolladian.blogspot.com](URL [helkorea.blogspot.com](URL [helpkorea.blogspot.com](URL [bosulachi.blogspot.com](URL [antihufs.blogspot.com](URL [antihufs.blogspot.com](URL [avstats.avira.com](URL Do you know these sites?

Do you know how many URLs you know, such as [blogspot.kr](URL [bosulachi.blogspot.com](URL [antihufs.blogspot.com](URL [antihufs.blogspot.com](URL A: I'm not sure, but I do not have access to all of the above. (The suspect opened multiple blogs with one Google mail account.) I insisted on 'Google Cache', and my parents and lawyers claimed that my laptop might have been hacked at this time. (Attorney Park Cheol-hyun who heard this statement stared at the suspect for a while without saying anything.) Jung Moon-sik Question: Why did you tell the log records that you have access to the above sites on July 7th and 8th, 2015, and that you have not accessed all of the above? A: I do not remember what I did at the time. (The suspect has not been able to access all of the blogs because he did not manage them by creating multiple blogs. Jung Moon-sik Moon: When the prosecution re-imaged the suspect's laptop, Jung Moon-sik said, ""I did not have Hangul input function on the laptop used by the suspect, but I entered Hangul using Internet input device. How do I input / output Hangul? (When imaging at the Cyber Office of the Public Prosecutors' Office, Cyber Investigator of the Chief Prosecutor's Office showed the process of analyzing the laptop to the suspect. A: Find the site that comes up with 'Hangul input device' on Google and click on the search result to input Hangul using the keyboard. There is a Korean keyboard on the notebook I bought and confiscated. The alphabet and Korean are shown on the keyboard. I used a French version of Windows XP on the laptop. I have installed a French version of Windows to enter French special characters. (The official testified, ""Why do you write it?"") And the suspect stated ""I bought the cheap laptop because I was unemployed, I wrote it with inconvenience."" But I did not record it in the record. However, the prosecution cyber investigator estimates it to be between two and three million won, ""from the beginning,"" the laptop's hard disk capacity is quite large. "" Jung Moon-sik Q: How do you describe the process of entering Korean into Google in detail? Answer: First, enter Google ([URL into the Internet address bar, and when the Google window appears, enter the Korean input device (gksrmfdlqfurrl) in English into the search box. Then, the Korean input method site appears in order, and from the top of the Korean input method site, click downward to find a site where you can input Korean. If you find a Hangul input site, you can input Hangul by using computer keyboard and then copy the Hangul input and paste it in the place where Hangul input is needed. (The suspect's laptop is in French, so typing [URL leads to [URL Even if you search for both sites with the same search terms, the order of the search results displayed is different.) Jung Moon-sik Moon: As a result of the prosecution's hacking test on the suspect's laptop, there are no signs of specially remote control (especially July 7, 2015, and July 8, 2015). How about this? And the suspect did not delete the access log from the laptop router? Answer: (The suspect does not answer the hacking test result.) I just entered the ID and password on the router, and I do not remember when I entered it. I did not delete the Router Access Log on June 25, 2015, June 7, 2015, and July 8, 2015. \++++++++++++++++++++ Forensic Investigation for Brother 6666 Case 2015 Verification Statement ++++++++++++++++++ ++ Author: In-Sung Kim, Professor, 010-5270-5779, No. 819-5, Bangbae-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul, (On January 19, 2016, Kim Yong-Min attorney handed in the opinion of professor Kim In-Sung) 1.

White House screen capture file The White House screen capture file is assumed to have been captured and stored by the suspect on this computer. There is no possibility of a hacking because the suspect has acknowledged that he or she has copied it directly (through testimony that he has been downloaded from the Internet and downloaded it). The file creation time differs by one minute from the time of writing to the White House, and the posting of the same contents on another site is after the time saved, and it is unlikely that it was downloaded from another site.

Answer: I do not know that, I talk to you again ... Q: Did you talk to the defendant? A: Yes, I keep coming and going now ... Q: Have you ever taken a video of a defendant's laptop or imaging process? A: It might have been done by a broadcaster, but I do not know exactly. Oh, I tried to shoot it, but I can not, so why do I just shoot my house? Q: Who has not let me? A: I do not know if they were parents or defendants who were there, but I strongly resisted them and I would have taken our picture there. If you look at the mobile phone, there might be some videos that we took pictures of. And then he just threw something at us and made it a bit harder. In the case of Kim Kyung-Hwan, the analyst would have been hit. Q: When I said that I needed an original copy of VMware for the reason why I confiscated the defendant's laptop, would not it be necessary to have a laptop if the program that runs VMware is on another PC? Answer: No. Depending on the version, it may not work. Q: Can I check the version in the imaging file? A: It was not a situation where you could do it on the spot, and if you wanted to drive it ... Q: It is technically possible to ask. Is it possible to have a program that can run VMware on another PC even if it is not a defendant's laptop? Answer: It is possible but not 100% guaranteed. So there were many cases where we were not able to drive properly. judge To witnesses Q: Is it common to have the notebook itself confiscated after imaging files? A: If we are confiscated, we will do all the confiscation. Q: Do you confiscate the imaging files as well as the notebook itself if you are in confiscation? A: Yes, because it is a laptop used for crime. Lawyer To witnesses Q: Did you say the witness took the seizure search warrant? Answer: We took it from our team. Q: Have you read it? Answer: Yes. Q: If you look at it, it is stated that ""the original that has been taken out will be opened and reproduced with the participation of the intruder, etc. and returned without any delay, but not exceeding 10 days from the original date of export unless there are special circumstances"" Why did not you return it? Answer: Computers have a very important time relationship in the evidence of digital evidence analysis. At that time, we analyzed the digital evidence analysis of the seized material to confirm the creation and access times. Last but not least, you can change your laptop's CMOS (cmos) time accordingly. There is an error depending on the time of the CMOS. So what if my laptop is at 1 o'clock, but the current time is 1: 5? We need to check the error in time. We need a laptop to check the error. We can return it before we send it to the last time. We asked our attorney and computer to turn on and check only the error with the defendant. Probably will be in the investigation report. So the prosecution has to check it out, it can not be sealed. So I know that the prosecution has confirmed the exact time information after taking a video of the whole process of releasing and releasing it. So it's been over a week. Q: What did the witness know to return? Answer: Yes. But you did not return, right? Answer: Yes. Moon: White House Contact us Write on the web page and select ""Thank you!"" Was there a picture on the defendant's notebook that captured the screen to write the previous post? A: I do not understand. Q: I have a screen that I'm writing before submitting. When I submit it, I get a screen saying 'Thank you!'. Can not these two screens exist at the same time? Answer: Yes. Q: Do you have a picture of the screen after the last submission of the statement ""Thank you!"" On the defendant's notebook? Answer: Yes. Q: Then you should have a screenshot of the scene you're writing in. Have you seen it? Answer, isis.png and usa.png are being written and Thank you! Screen and combine ... Q: It's a composite, is not it? Answer: Yes. Perhaps you have not found what you are writing. It did not exist because it was edited and made into a png file. Maybe, if you can explain it. Q: You said that five files were found on the defendant's laptop using Google Chrome, remember? Answer: Yes. Q: In the first post, I do not have a caption of an isis.png file that says I will rape my daughter, do you know why? A: That's probably what you see in the investigation report, but if you capture and delete it and then change the filename or the file does not exist, or if you capture it using the Google Chrome browser's incognito mode, There are many technical ways that you can and can not keep up with many things. Q: But what about the file 'Thank you!', What happened? A: I can not tell you that because I have nothing to do with the evidence, it's because I want to leave it and I want to keep it. Q: Is that technically possible? Answer: Yes. Q: You did not find any traces of access to the White House on the defendant's laptop? Answer: I did not find it at all. Q: By the way, 'Thank you!' I have found that I captured the part, how should I explain it? A: If you use the Google Chrome browser's incognito mode, the Internet connection itself will not be saved as a file at all. It will only be saved as a cache, but it will not be saved as soon as you close the web browser. I will. Q: As the witness has just testified, it would be nice to have no screenshot of 'Thank you!' , A: That means you do not have a record of your Internet connection and you can leave a capture file. Q: After the capture file, the number is actually a Unix number, so you can log in to Google Chrome to get information on when you captured it, but the witness does not have an article written right now and it probably does not capture it in Google Incognito mode. You just did. That's why I do not ask you to leave the ""Thank you!"" Section in incognito mode. A: Internet access records and captions are completely different. Q: Why do not you leave a screenshot called ""Thank you!"" In response to an incognito answer saying that you may not have a captured file. Answer: The defendant remains on the defendant's computer because he has captured and saved it. Q: So it is possible that you have to do it in the same conditions that you captured before that ... Answer: If you do not want to leave, you can not leave. Q: Then you can find the erased trail? Now that I've imaged the defendant's laptop, I'm not just looking at it, have I removed the deleted file? Answer: When I go into incognito mode, I have worked and can not restore it. Why did Google create incognito mode? I have tested it myself. judge To witnesses Q: Did you know whether the defendant used incognito mode? Answer: It can not be confirmed. Google has made the feature available to you when you're trying to do it in secret, and of course you can not tell whether or not you used it. Lawyer To witnesses Q: When I go into incognito mode, I do not think the capture screen should be saved. Answer: No. Saved is that the internet connection is stored in the index.dat and various computer hard disks, and the connection record is not stored. In the case of the captured file, it is possible to store it anywhere in the desired location, The captured files are completely separate. Q: Did the witness confirm the blog posts that the defendant usually wrote? Answer: Yes. Q: Have you seen any criticism of Kim Kyeong-jong about the case of Repert's ambassador in the defendant's blog post? A: I do not remember everything right now. I only remember what I said before. Q: I do not remember? Answer: Yes. Q: I had an emergency arrest of the defendant at the time, but was there any reason for the emergency arrest? A: Because I did not do it, I would look at the reasons for the arrest. Q: I do not have a reason for an emergency arrest, so what do you ask? A: Why is not the reason written? You have to write down your reasons for getting an emergency arrest proposal. (Suggesting an investigation record, page 455) Q: The reason for the arrest has been listed all the time. Please write down the details according to the reason for the emergency arrest. That's it. do not have. A: I did not write it, but at the metro ... Oh, that's what you said about the notice. In the notice, we wrote the reason for the emergency arrest for the approval from the prosecutor's office without writing the reason, and is not the suspect notified to the suspect when the emergency arrest occurs? Because it is putting in notice, it is because it is because it is very simple to summarize the fact of crime. That is not what I wrote. Do not ask me. Q: Who wrote it? Answer: There will be a writer. judge Is there an emergency arrest warrant? witness Yes. Lawyer To witnesses Q: Is there a reason listed there? Not on record ... Answer: Yes, detailed. inspection An Emergency Arrest Form with detailed description of the reason is available. Lawyer To witnesses Q: The witness did not write the confiscation list? Yes, I did not write it. Q: Do you know who wrote it? A: Then several people are working on it ... Q: What are the threats and screen capture files that the defendant claims to have downloaded and that the witness or investigating agency believes that the defendant has written and captured it? Answer: Yes. Q: If I download a screened file and save it on the defendant's laptop, is it possible that it exists in the same format as the one captured by the defendant's laptop as the witness verified? A: There are two ways. Probably Kim Jin-kwang will test it and have an investigation report because of 4chan. If you click on the original file to download it, it will be downloaded. Otherwise, if you click on the original file, the image file will pop up and you can download it with right mouse click. That is another report from our investigation. I did not test it ... Q: Is there a file name that might be the same as the one you captured? A: I do not understand. Again only a description ... Q: If I downloaded the defendant's laptop, I just analyzed the file name just like the one I captured on the defendant's laptop, can it exist with the same file name? A: You should be in the record. Ask Kim Jin-kwang because I have not tested it. Q: Do you not know the witness? Answer: We have tested and simulated in the investigation report. Q: The time order is the time the defendant posted on the White House, the time they saved on the laptop after the screen capture, and the time they posted on the site [4chan.org](URL A: If it is so in the investigation report, it will. Because I can not remember correctly now, I made a table, and I look at it. Lawyer I will present evidence. I present one or two of the fifth certificate. judge What is the source? Lawyer This is what the defendant's brother searched on Google after he had been arrested after the incident. If you look at the same thing on Google ... you know, but you searched on Google. Here you see 'dear. Mr.president Obama, Mrs.first lady Mishelle ', and the time it was found that this article was written is posted on 4chan site on July 7, 2015. 7. 07:24:52. inspection How can I confirm that this is the same as this article? Lawyer To witnesses Q: If you see below, 'Hi I'm sufs student from Seoul' because some part of the post is behind it? It seems that the article is the same, but the time zone is quite different now. The time is 07:24:52 AM. Now, the time to write the article is July 7, 20:20. By the way, the time posted on 4chan site is July 7, 2015, 07:24:52. A: In our investigation report, we have captured the exact time on 4chan site. That's precise, because it's from a Google search, so you can not tell exactly what time it was on Google or 4chan. Q: If you saved it from Google, is it any time sooner than we know it? Answer: There is no guarantee for low-time information. Q: Witnesses have never seen this? Answer: Yes. There is not. And whether it is US storage time, domestic storage time ... Q: For the second article, it looks like it was written on July 7, 2015. Did you know that the 4chan site time that the witness checked was stored in domestic time when posting in Korea? A: Ask Kim Jin-kwang, the investigator. Q: Do you not know the witness? Answer: We have posted the post on 4chan site and we have the current time and the test time. That's exactly what we tested. If you look at it, you can check whether the 4chan site has domestic time or US time. Q: Have you ever checked your time zone separately? A: Yes, I have not done it, so I can not tell you exactly. Q: Did you say that the defendant used a program called SuperHideIP, an IP change program? A: It's not a confirmation, it's a program that was installed. It was discovered. Q: Are there any facts that have been analyzed that the last approach was made on June 6, 2015, before the date on which the blackmail was written? Answer: The file was found, the date the file was first saved, and the date the file was last accessed. Q: I analyzed it as the last access on June 6, 2015. Is it possible to interpret the IP as having no change since then? A: It may or may not have been because there are too many technical methods, which I do not know exactly. Q: Because the witness did not see whether the defendant wrote the program or not, but after all, did you look at the defendant's laptop? Is there a similar program in the program that changes the IP found this one? A: You can not see the whole thing. When we analyze ... Q: Do you have to search and search? So, what was the one that was discovered in connection with the IP change program? Answer: Yes. Q: Did you investigate the router? A: I heard there was a router, but I did not investigate. Question: Do you think that the defendant's notebook imaging file was the first image of the notebook file, or was it replicated again? A: Because I did not analyze it ... Q: What did you do to replicate that day? A: Did we bring the clone? Q: Who took it? A: The analyst Kim Kyung Hwan should have brought it. \-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- It seems that the time has changed to Korean time in the process of being seated. Answer: The analysis report is the final one, and we have to investigate a little bit before we start the analysis. So I took the printout, put it in the investigation report, and made a note when I checked it out. How do you investigate having a fully written report? Q: The decisive reason for suspicion that the defendant wrote the blackmail was that the capture file that was left on the defendant's notebook was created about a minute after it was posted on the White House? ANSWER: When I was threatened, however, I wrote two blackmails on the White House website in English, which was in the S.txt file written in Hangul and the summer @ hufs You said you stole your .ac.kr email and phone number? Maybe that phone number and address were in the s.txt file and ... Q: Witness, I tried to ask this, not many charges. Was it one of the decisive proofs that the creation time of the capture file was one minute after the article was published? Answer: There were many things. Q: What is the difference between the time the article was posted in the White House and the time the capture file was stored on the defendant's laptop, A: It's not an analysis, but an objective fact ... Q: How did you know when the post was posted on the White House? A: You asked us that, but we have only received data from the international team. Q: I think the one minute car will be a very important basis, right? Answer: Yes. Q: Then I ask you in terms of whether the investigation should be done enough about time. I have to be specific from the time it is posted on the White House, but the time posted on the White House is probably the time that the person administering the White House homepage gave me, and that time could be time lag in the end? A: When we told it, we were GMT + 9? The United States has several times, including Eastern Time. I'm not exactly sure if we are Eastern Standard Time for letting us know what the error is, but it probably will. It calculates the time and the error, and when domestic time is converted into Korea Standard Time, it is time to calculate the exact time and the IP connected to the time is Dongdaemun Cable TV ... Q: I do not ask for the calculation method. For example, if this computer now has 16:00 on the front of the laptop, is there any error in that? I'm looking at it. There may be an error in the time given by the White House, and there may be an error in the time when the witness etc. So I'm asking how the time difference can be determined to be one minute. Answer: Because we are made by objective data, we have confirmed that we know the time we have stored on our computers and the time we have been threatened. Q: Do you know that there is a program that can change the date of creation of saved files? Answer: Yes. Q: I have a couple of things, but can I use a program like SetFileDate to change the creation date of a saved file? Answer: Yes. Q: Is it possible that the defendant 's notebook has changed so much? Answer: Not all computers, as well as the defendant's laptop, are capable of such manipulation. However, when you analyze the MFT, the information about the time is stored in various ways. If you analyze MFT's standard information information and file name information information and analyze that the information is different, you can check whether the time has been manipulated or not, whether the file name has been changed. Q: Did you check it at the time? A: I did not check at the time. Q: When the MAC address of the router is changed, is the dynamic IP connected to it also changed? A: It may or may not appeal, but it is the policy of the telecommunications company. Q: Did the witness verify the MAC address corresponding to the IP address associated with this case during the investigation? Answer: Yes. Q: Is it a witness? A: I would have done it together. Q: What was the result? A: I put it in the comments, but the contents of the mac are too complicated, so I think I should look at the written statement. I do not remember exactly now. Q: Have you found any signs of changing the MAC address of the router on the defendant's laptop? A: The digital evidence analyst found it. Q: Is the witness unaware of this part? Answer: I heard that there is a trace of change that I am not familiar with. Q: Does the analyst in the role of analyst only do the analysis, or did he conduct additional investigations besides analysis? Answer: I just did analysis. Q: According to the results of the analysis, was the witness doing any further investigations? Answer: What is the additional investigation? Q: For example, if you find a trace of a change in your mac address, I would ask you if you needed to check the defendant's router, did not you? Answer: The MAC address is the manufacturer of the first six digits, and the manufacturer assigns the last six digits of the MAC address. We have probably seen a counter-report of the defendant's comment on the mac address, but if the manufacturer makes a random change to it I can not do the investigation anymore. Your lawyer tells you that if the mac has been changed, and if you have not done any further investigations about it, there is no clue that you can investigate anymore if mac has changed that way. Q: I asked if I needed to check the defendant's router. A: When we did the transcription, the digital evidence analysis was at the end, and I have to hand over the suspect's recruits to the prosecution office tomorrow. What do you do? Q: Did you mean you could not do it on time? Answer: Yes. Q: There was a trace of changing the MAC address on the defendant's laptop, and there was analysis that released the log record at the time of the crime, remember? A: I told you I did not do it. Q: Do you know this by Kim Kyung Hwan? Answer: Yes. Question: According to the statement of witness submitted by the witness in relation to the mac address, there are several mac addresses that are not confirmed by the manufacturer. If the maker changes to an unconfirmed mac address, Go? Answer: I do not know the carrier policy, so I can not answer exactly, I know it is not. Q: Do you know that if you change to an unconfirmed mac address depending on your carrier policy, Internet access may be restricted? ANSWER: Yes, there is a case where the switch is allowed to access the internet when only a certain MAC address is connected, which is called NAC. If you do not set this policy, you are allowed to connect from the internet regardless of the MAC address. This is the carrier policy. There are two technologies on the switch that can or may not be blocked. Q: I know that if you change your router or MAC address arbitrarily, you may be restricted from accessing the Internet. Do you know? For example, have you ever heard of such cases in Windows 7 or Windows 8? Answer: Not at all. However, if you change the mac address, there is no problem with internet access. Q: Is there any problem with the computer? A: Yes, it takes less than a minute and you can do it right away. judge To witnesses Q: I have a question about the defendant's question. ""I wrote on the White House Contact us webpage, and I found 'Thank you!' In response to the question ""Did the defendant have a picture of the screen capturing the screen before writing the screen?"", The witness said, ""No one was writing, because it was edited and made into a png file."" I have an answer, please tell me about it again. A: The screen you are composing and the screen where you have completed the 'Thank you! 1' screen was synthesized as a png file, but the screen you were composing was not saved and only the pictures that were composited were correct . But it's technically possible to synthesize it. Q: Please explain how technically possible. Answer: Take a picture of A with a capture tool such as Paint or Snap-in, capture a picture of B, put B under A, select the file again and save the file as a different file. I will explain it again. When you capture the screen you are creating with the Google Chrome browser, you will see the url address and the time next to it. Then, when you save it to the defendant's computer in that state, click the right mouse button and save it under the same name. Then, when you capture the screen 'Thank you!', You will see the url address and time information at the top and 'Thank you!'. And if you save it under a different name, it will be saved on the defendant's computer. However, technically you can right click on the 'Thank you!' Screen and save it to your computer. You can take the first screen without saving it, and then use the Paint or other capture tool If you save this file as usa.png or isis.png, you will not be able to save the first image you created, and the second image will be saved You can save only the final result at the end. Q: I was wondering if it was possible technically, but you answered with the idea that it is possible? Answer: Yes. inspection To witnesses Q: I heard that the screen of the writing on the defendant's notebook is not found, but the relevant screen is not found, and the capture file of the process of posting on the White House site is found. A: Yes, it does not matter, but I do not know exactly what happened before in June, but before that I had a copy of the White House story that I was capturing and capturing. If you are writing a webpage, you will see a wave in Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Safari, and spelling. If you're writing on the White House website, Due to the law of alignment, a tilde appears at the bottom of the English alphabet. If you look at it, you can see that it is a screen that you are writing. I captured it and kept other articles, but I do not remember it correctly. I think it was related to black slaves at that time. Q: In regards to the reporter ambassador threatening text, did you also find a separate screen capture of only the result screen ""Thank you!""? Answer: Yes. Q: I heard that the defendant posted the file on 4chan earlier than the defendant posted at the White House. Did you confirm this in the police investigation? Answer: Yes. Q: Did you find that a capture file with the same contents as the intimidation of this case was posted on 4chan site at the time? Answer: Yes. Q: The capture files found at 4chan site at that time were posted earlier than the date of creation of the crime-related capture file found on the defendant's computer. A: I do not remember exactly. Q: By default, when you use the internet through an ISP like Dongdaemun Tibur Road, is the IP assigned by the carrier? Answer: Yes. Q: How many IPs can be changed by turning the computer off and on, or changing the Mac address randomly? Answer: Yes. Q: In the case of Dongdaemun Tiburdo IP, which is used in this case, I do not want the IP to be assigned to a specific user for a certain period of time and use only that IP, but then the IP will be changed. Answer: Yes. Q: I do not know whether SuperHideIP was used, but how can I change IP even if SuperHideIP is not used? Answer: Yes. Q: Did you find a program on the defendant's computer to change the file's creation date? Answer: None at all. Q: Is it possible that the defendant changed the creation date of the capture file stored on his computer to the date and time of the crime of this case by confirming the time of the crime? A: If you are a suspect, do not you need to change? I do not need to change the time on my computer, even if I change the IP to conceal it. I can not be certain who I am. So even if you try to hide your IP, you do not need to change the file on your computer. Lawyer To witnesses Q: The second file 'Thank you!' I found that only the part of the captured file was found, the second threatening 'Thank you!' How do you know if it's a part? Answer: Maybe in time ... Q: Is it specific in time? Answer: Yes. Q: You do not know what you wrote? A: Yes, I do not know what it is, but what I am writing ... Q: Thank you! Even after writing a different article, it can exist at the same time. Answer: That's possible. Q: And have you ever seen the ""Rules for the Collection and Handling of Digital Evidence"", which is a Witness Ordinance? A: I think I've seen it. Q: Here are the details of the procedures for seizure search and the request for analysis, and I will ask if I have kept the procedure. I did not refuse to shoot the seizure process, and I have to take measures such as the identity of the digital evidence, such as the storage seal, and the proper method of not having a reasonable suspicion of integrity. Answer: We sealed the notebook. Q: I have to ask Kim Kyung Hwan. You said you did not know if you sealed the hard disk you were imaging before? I asked the analyst to analyze the digital seizure. According to the analysis result report, the analyst was a witness. A: Because I'm the same team, I could do it, or someone next to me could do it. Q: Do you think you made an analysis request on July 13, 2015? A: I did not go to the scene from the beginning. I do not even ask for it. Q: Is not there a formal request for a separate request? A: Yes, I went to the scene together. Q: When the analysis request is made, the analyst has to send the original or duplicate of the digital seizure in a container that can be safely stored so as not to be damaged by shock, magnetic field, moisture and dust. Answer: It is because I confiscated analytical data from other crime scenes and submitted it to the Digital Evidence Analysis Office of the Cyber Crime Investigation Department of Seoul Metropolitan City, so I have to do such a thing in the course of the process. At that time, This is not what we do, because the digital analyst in the field is doing it. Q: Is it the right thing to take in such a container? Answer: Ask your digital evidence analyst. Q: Do you not know the witness? Answer: Yes. judge To witnesses Q: In the end, I think it is the intent that the witness is handed over to the digital witness analyst on the spot, right? Answer: Yes. judge I will finish the witness newspaper about the witness Nam Sang Wook.

Q: How did you check each posting date and connection IP above? A: I also logged on to the White House homepage, and I received it from the police and handed it to us. Q: Please describe the reason why the defendant was identified as the suspect of each crime in this case. Answer: Once there was no clue except for the connection IP, I received a reply that I could not confirm the subscriber because I requested the subscriber information on Dongdaemun Cable TV Road TV with that IP. So, when we check the area where we can get the IP to check the subscribers, we can not remember exactly in Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul. We have heard that there is a possibility that it can be allocated from about 2, 500 households, and when we check the MAC address on the computer, we can find the investigation lead to the MAC address. I checked to the closest apartment complex I was assigned. When I narrowed it down, it was O apartment where I can check it, it was the defendant's apartment. I do not know how many apartments there are in the apartment, but if there are 20 floors, it is 20th floor because there are 20th floor and 20th floor. I have only recruited subscribers to Dongdaemun cable TV from 20th generation. I do not remember exactly, but it has been reduced to about 5 \~ 6 generations, and I had to look through 5 \~ 6 generations and I could not do that. I analyzed the crime trends and impersonated isis. I also impersonated the Korean foreign affairs staff from the phone number and e - mail address of the Korea Foreign Student Summer School. So a team of our investigation team was sent out to the outside world to check if there really is such a person, and there is no such thing there is a person who has a bad tendency to the outside world is not an optical investigation, I confirmed the propensity of. And there are two criminal intimidation articles: the first is the daughter 's intimidation to President Obama and the second is the intimidation to Ambassador Ripper that the second daughter of Obama, Natasha, is raped by anus. This can be seen as a bit of a kinky tendency of the writer, and the second is to threaten Ambassador Repert, whose weapon is called a nuclear weapon. I found a tendency that I could not imagine in a mental state, which is a little impolite. I checked the apartment tenant management card because I thought it was very likely to be an outside official in O apartment. So I think that the defendant goes to a foreign language university I confirmed that. So I checked the defendant's regular phone number, searched Google, and found ten defendant blogs. There was a criticism of the foreign ministry, and the reason why I criticized it was that my majors were changed and I was disadvantageous to my job. The second time I was raped by my ancestor, I saw a picture of him taking off his clothes, wearing panties and wearing a bucket, and checking his account to ask him to donate himself a little. I was criticizing many other foreigners, and after all that was the right thing, I applied for a seizure search warrant and got a warrant for seizure search at Seoul Central District Court. So I went to the house with a formal search warrant. The computer in the defendant's room was unused, there was a computer in the next room study, I looked at both computers and found nothing related to the crime. Then there was another room next to the kitchen, and the visit was locked, so I asked my mother to open the door and I knew that maybe I could have entered one. I went in and got a laptop and I saw that the computer language was in French so we did not know French so I had no idea what folder my computer was or what folder it was. When we checked the digital evidence analyzer, President Obama and two of the original captures of Ambassador Ripper were found immediately, so I suspected the defendant had written it, and then shut it down. It was probably about 20:42. I then disconnected the hard disk from the notebook. After we disconnected it, we connected it to the computer cloning equipment, then we had the original hard disk, reconnected the copy hard disk and cloned the same. When you make a copy, the hash value of the hard disk on the defendant's laptop is the same as the replicated hard disk. For example, a hash value is a tool for proving integrity. If the defendant's computer hash value is A, then the hash value of our copy hard disk will be equal to A. Then, in the state of A, if we do not touch the copy, we do the analysis in the same A state whether or not it is sealed. When analyzing a copy of computer A, there is a write-protect device, not just an analysis. Since the integrity of a computer hard disk is immediately broken when we connect it to the hard disk protector, no matter what I analyze by connecting the copy, the copy hard disk is not changed at all. And the file called Imaging is created as a file, and the file can not be changed. If it changes, if you change the hash on the hard disk of the copy, it will be changed to B instead of A. That's why the hard disk you image is the same as analyzing with the same original A anytime and anywhere. It was discovered, and we proceeded with the seizure search for four hours at that time, and the defendant was lying in his room with only panties and not at all until we went. I asked him, ""Is this the right thing you wrote on your laptop,"" and then I drank a little and said, ""I do not know at all. We talked that way, and we persuaded him for three hours, even though he was able to arrest an emergency at the time because of the destruction of the evidence and the reasons for it in the future. Q: Is the date and time of the seizure of the seizure on July 13, 1945? A: Yes, I would have probably started from then. Q: Was the confiscated lenovo B490 laptop computer, four hard disks, and a USB stick? Answer: There was a bit of a mistake, but I checked my laptop for evidence and immediately shut down my computer and immediately started imaging. I opened the imaging and sealed my laptop right away. Because the integrity was changed, I sealed it. When I sealed it, my mother wrote it, and I put my mother 's letter, we rolled it with tape and sealed it. There was a virtual machine program called VMware installed. If you do not have a computer notebook, then you may not be able to analyze it in the future, so we need the original, so the notebook is seized separately. Q: On the defendant's laptop computer, isis.png, usa.png, a file capturing screen captures of each blackmail? Answer: Yes. Q: Did the defendant confirm the source of each file shortly after the discovery? A: I asked, but I can not remember exactly whether you talked in the way that you downloaded it from the internet or you did not talk at all. Anyway, he denied that he did not. Because I received too many surveys, I did not know exactly what I said at the time, but I told him that I did not do it anyway. Q: I checked the creation date and time of each capture file. Was it confirmed within 1 minute immediately after each crime? Answer: Yes.

I've been asking that a lot, but at first I thought it was the one I wrote, and then I did not answer at all.

The witness explained the details of the process of tracing the defendant in advance, saying, ""The clue only had an IP address, but it was difficult to find by IP address alone. I checked the subscriber on Dongdaemun Tibur Road, but I could not confirm it, so I made a request to the Mac address again. "" Answer: You have checked your Mac to investigate with a Mac address. Q: Who identified the Mac? Answer: When IP is allocated from the carrier, IP and MAC are connected to the carrier. If you know the MAC of the IP you used for the crime at the time, you can do the investigation again with the MAC address. But that Mac did not come out correctly either. Anyway, I have a network switch, and I've finally assigned that IP ... So you have confirmed the last switch. Q: Is it confirmed that you have three sets of equipment? Answer: Yes, I have to explain the connection ... Q: When the attorney heard this, the witness first asked for the Mac address and asked the carrier to recall the Mac address.

A: Yes, but I was not an official digital evidence analyst. While doing the investigation ... Q: Witnesses also have that knowledge? A: Yes, I did it. Q: So, at the time of the seizure, did two or more people have expertise in digital evidence? Answer: Yes. Q: What did the related equipment bring?

ANSWER: Yes, I just found a picture, shot it on my phone and shut down my laptop. \-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- \-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- \-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- A: The 4chan site is USA, so we can not verify the subscribers. Q: Did not you know who posted it? Answer: Yes. But ask Kim Jin-kwang again for this question. Moon: Looking at the flow of investigation, it's like ... A: I remember that there was such a situation, but I do not know exactly, so I can ask Kim Jin-kwang. Q: Who wrote the seizure? A: There must be an author of the seizure.

Q: In the confiscation list, the confiscation of the defendant's laptop itself is listed, but the imaging file for the defendant's laptop imaging is not on the confiscation list, do you know? A: I did not know it because I did not write it. I know that I need to write a notebook imaging number 1 on the serial number. Q: Anyway, is it obvious that the laptop imaging was done at the time of the search? Answer: Yes. Q: How many hours did it take? A: You can ask Kim Kyung-hwan, a digital evidence analyst. Q: Because I have experience analyzing digital evidence, I'll ask. What does hash value mean in digital evidence collection and analysis? Answer: MD5 and SHA1 are one of the functions for proving integrity. For example, if you put this stuff into this hash function, you get some specific result. But it is not an inverse function. For example, if you put a file called A and B into a hash function, you will get a certain unique value, which means that if the unique value is the same, it is the same information. So if you turn the hash value of the hard disk in the original and get A, and you get the A by rotating the hash of the hard disk that replicated the original, you can prove that the original and replicated hard disk information is the same. Q: Do you see that digital evidence is in a specific state at the time you generate the hash value, and then do you assume the integrity and authenticity of the original until it is examined by the court? Answer: The question is ambiguous, not a specific state ... Q: I'll ask you a little bit. When I image the defendant's laptop and get the hashed value, the defendant's laptop is at that point in time, right? Answer: If you run a hash function on a file named A instead of a state, you will get a specific result. Whenever it does, the same result is produced, not the state at that point ... Q: The hash value is telling you when the first was created. Answer: Yes, that's right. Q: What is the point of creating the integrity of a file at a particular point in time? Answer: Yes. Q: After that, of course, you can come up several times, and I'll tell you when it was first created. A: I do not understand the question. Q: When I image the defendant's laptop, is the state of the defendant's laptop at that time imitated as evidence in the court? Answer: Imaged files can not be changed. Q: Is it still maintained? A: I guarantee that my police will not change until I send them to the prosecution. But after that, I do not know. Q: If you look at the notebook imaging file at the court, the file we're looking at is the same as the file at the time the witness did the imaging at the time of the seizure? Answer: Yes. Q: Is it fixed at that point? Answer: Yes. Q: So is not the hash value guaranteeing the integrity of the earlier steps we collected in the first time we collected the confidential search? Answer: Because it is the hash value at the time of imaging ... Q: From then on, to guarantee integrity, not to guarantee the integrity of the old, right? A: Yes, it does not make sense. Q: So, if someone logs out a hash after logically manipulating the computer, does not it provide information about the operation or operation before the hash value is created? Answer: Of course. Q: At the time of the seizure, was the defendant's notebook turned off? A: I do not remember exactly. That's not what I brought ... Q: I turned on the notebook and said that I saw one or the other. A: I can not remember exactly because my mother brought me something in the other room. We could not get in that room. Q: The seizure start time was around July 13, 2015, and the power of the notebook was turned on and off from July 13, 2015 to 20:47. The laptop was on for about 41 minutes. What did you do on the laptop at this time? A: At that time, I did not work, and I would probably have been working on finding analysts and files. Q: Did you write protection at that time? A: I did not do it then. Q: In the process of looking at the defendant's laptop, did he / she guarantee the right of the defendant or the defendant's parents to participate? Answer: It was said. &amp;#x200B;"

Answer: Yes. judge To witnesses Q: I said I wrote an Internet post, but I misstated it? Answer: First of all, 4chan or something like this is what I did after capturing separately, and the parts from the defendant's notebook were written by me because Kim Kyung-hwan's analyst could not write the investigation report.

A: I did not focus on the time when writing, but instead of backing up the original files on my desktop computer, I created a folder called ""Terrorist"" and had an original under it, There is a method and a download button called isis.png below it. I clicked on that button and downloaded it in two ways, but the important thing is that the investigation report was written to specify that 'MD5 is the same, if MD5 is the same, this file is the same' I saved the file to my computer and compared it with it, and I do not remember the date exactly.

Can you do it? Answer: Although the name of the file can be changed because the computer is clearly distinguished, the root cause of the screen capture is a program called full page screen capture on the defendant's computer. When you capture using this program, the file name is created uniquely. Because there is a name and a date and it is hard for ordinary people to write it, so if there is such a thing, it should be said that it was programmed ...

A: I do not know because it is not confirmed. Q: This is what the witness made when he wrote the investigation report. If you posted in Korea, you would be posting Korean time on 4chan site? So the time I posted on the 4chan site was later than the time of the file on the laptop because the defendant wrote it. But now the time I searched on Google is much faster than the time I posted on the case. That 's why I ask. Q: I do not know exactly what I am talking about. But first of all, this is Google.
