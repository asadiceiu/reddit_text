He said he had obtained a picture of another user on the site without the other user even knowing...

So, I've been programming for a while. I've never been too good with cybersecurity, but my brother's really into it and I follow some subs on it. One thing that I always notice is that any post referencing any sort of attempt to use hacking to make significant change is almost always made fun of relentlessly in the comments. And, I get it. Cybersecurity is hard to get into, and I'm sure there's always new people joining the community only influenced by shows like Mr. Robot (which is a good show imo but may attract undedicated people). Also, any hacking ""groups"" that are public knowledge are pretty shitty. But hear me out. It's not *impossible* to use hacking as a force of good. Think of that gray-hat a while back who was [breaking into routers to save them from a hacking attack.](URL I'm sure there has to be some other skilled people who are unhappy with the current state of the world, or just wanna do good, too. My brother always told me, the best hackers are the ones we never know about. Maybe that's why we're so harsh on them? If they're bragging in public it speaks to them not taking cybersecurity seriously? I mean there's already countless stories of people committing cybercrime, sometimes with good intentions. But their identities are always revealed once law enforcement gets to them, not on some online forum. Pushing that all of aside, didn't everyone start at the ""skiddie"" stage at one point or another anyway? May sound lame, but I decided to start programming after watching the Matrix. Neo seemed like the coolest fucking guy in the world to me. I'm sure a lot of legitimate hackers came to be from movies and tv shows too. Even if you weren't influenced by the media, I'm sure there was a point in many of our lives where we were on the outside looking in on a tech community we wanted to be a part of so badly. If anything, skiddies could just be people at this stage. At one point or another, I'm sure if they are passionate and spend enough time, they will *have* to grow out of downloading brute force programs or making phishing links. It's the circle of life. But I dunno, it was just something I was thinking about. Maybe we're all just disappointed that being a software engineer/cybersecurity technician wasn't as exciting as we thought it would be, so now we take it out on the new people who still have stars in their eyes and the desire to make a difference. I'm genuinely curious about what makes these types of people so infuriating to a certain part of the community. Thanks in advance for any discussion! Cheers!"

Pay by cash give customer discounts. This help to circulate counterfeit cash? * Change and bank and paypal website log in password after each purchase. * Don't access your bank apps or enter your bank app password while on the bus, tram or train as people around you or sitting behind you can learn about your password via peeping over your shoulder or via secret app video of you entering your passwords. Delete banking apps from your phone and only keep your online banking via one device in home safe. * Avoid sharing credit or debit card numbers for online payments, use Paypal, Samsung Pay and Apple Pay if you have to. * It's important to have some cash in a secret safe. Criminals could empty your bank accounts. * Only one bank app on one device for your banking. Nothing more. Eliminate or reduce online banking if possible. * Keep all your digital and organic purchase receipts and just do a match of number of receipts you have with your credit or debit card bank statements. * When using bank credit/debit card via phone, turn off NFC when not paying. * Use RFID credit or debit card sleeve or RFID wallet to prevent people scanning your card from behind you. Keep your card at home safe and use trusted phone bank app to pay. * Keep your credit or debit cards locked via bank app all the time, unlock when you need to pay, then lock your card. * Choose a big bank that you can via bank phone app, reduce the daily withdrawal amount to $100, toggle lock / unlock international card payment, lock / unlock local EFTPOS payments, lock / unlock online payments. * Avoid performing online financial transactions on public or shared devices or devices that you suspect are compromised. * Avoid using library or public computers, hackers often plant viruses in those computers to mine your personal details when you log into your email accounts or plugged in your USB drive which you plug into your home computer to infect your family member computers via home WiFi. You and your family members bank accounts emptied and your life cloud data deleted. * Never pick up phone calls or reply SMS to marketers or anyone you don't know in real life. If the person leave voice mail, don't call back the phone number in the voice mail. Google the business phone number and call the business from the website search result. Beforehand, google ""business xyz review"" to determine if it is a scam business. * Verify any odd or suspicious requests through official bank's contact numbers or channels. * Use secret dedicated phone number for banking only. Use secret dedicated phone number for 1st level blood family only. * Read the transaction details in the SMS or email alerts carefully. Validate that the messages, for example, check that the account number is correct, or the transaction reflects your request. Do not provide a One-Time Password (OTP) or bank's digital token authorization if the details in the SMS or email alerts do not match the transaction you initiated. Inform the bank immediately if in doubt. * Check your transaction history regularly for any abnormal transaction and call the bank immediately. * Keep your contact details updated with the bank. * Commit your bank's username and password to memory, do not write it down on paper let alone in a password manager or on any computer or phone. * Choose a random PIN for your ATM card and / or phone identification. Get an ATM card that always require the payer to enter PIN code to make purchases no matter the value of the purchase. Never log into banking using public WiFi. Log into online banking using only the web browser or the official app of the bank. Never any third party app. * Sign up for official bank app alerts from your bank whenever a withdrawal is made or a new payee added to your banking. Enter the URL of your bank everytime you visit the bank on the web. Never click links to it. Configure your web browser to remember the wrong password to your bank online log in, where only you remember the correct password from memory. Sandbox your bank accounts by opening a bank account with most of your money with bank A that doesn't have online banking and a bank account with Bank B that have transaction accounts in online banking. Never type in your passport, driver's license or other government issued identity document online or take photo of your driver's license and store it online. If you need to open bank accounts, go to the bank in person. * Why dont banking app after website / app sign in page shows last log in date &amp; time to max security against unauthorised access / use? * Count cash in wallet everyday after you reached home and count the cash in the wallet again after you wake up. * Don't leave money lying around in the jacket or table at home, workplace or outside because anyone could steal money from you - even your family members. **Australia Cybersecurity Centre** \&gt;&gt; [URL **Agency Cybercrime Australian Cybercrime Online Reporting Network (ACORN)** \&gt;&gt; [URL **Stay Smart Online Service**[URL  CyberSmart website[URL  Stay Smart Online guidesavailable at [URL **Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA)** \&gt;&gt; [URL or call the ACMA Customer Service Centre on 1300 850 115 How to protect yourself when you visit ""sensitive"" websites [URL Stay Safe Web Browsing [URL How do you know you are hacked?

I am hoping for some advice from those in cyber and/or those who have completed online certificates (or even in-person non-degree university programs like U.T.s Bootcamp) on what the best way to get the fundamentals is. Of course, one of my main concerns is how my education will be perceived by future employers (i.e. what's the most reputable online certificates-- like George Washington University vs SANS.) I found the programs can be split between programs offered by universities and those by other online schools. I'd love to hear thoughts and feedback. Heres the breakdown: Group 1: Cyber studies from recognized universities, and it seems that the syllabus of these courses is a little more general and theoretical than technical. Group 2: Cyber education certificates from several different private colleges, offering various certificates by a cyber expert (eg Cyber Security Analyst CySA +) and job security. This is usually a self-paced study course or a field study in the format of Cyber Boot Camp. I would love to receive a recommendation on what is the best way to enter and enter the field.

By [David Hambling](URL 23, 2019TOWFIQU PHOTOGRAPHYGETTY IMAGES. [*The Decade, Reviewed*](URL *looks back at the 2010s and how it changed human society forever. From 2010 to 2019, our species experienced seismic shifts in science, technology, entertainment, transportation, and even the very planet we call home. This is how the past ten years have changed us.* The 2010s saw a step change in [cyber warfare](URL defined as attacks against a nation by a computer. Rather than just being used for spying, this was the decade the digital world was weaponized to break through to the physical. Analysts had long warned about the potential for cyber operations. Now, malware has attacked machinery, power grids, and military control systems and brought a new dimension to warfare. This is how cyberwarfare came of age in the 2010s. ### A Long List of Cyber Skirmishes In 2010, the [Stuxnet](URL worm targeted Iranian nuclear facilities. This was no ordinary piece of malware, but the product of what political scientist P.W. Singer called [a Manhattan Project-like](URL effort, by unknown actors. Stuxnet infected logic controllers running industrial machinery, specifically targeting centrifuges used for enriching uranium. The malware made the centrifuges spin out of control and tear themselves apart, severely disruption Irans nuclear program. Soon this kind of [Cyber Coercion](URL became an established technique for applying strategic political pressure. In March 2013, [simultaneous attacks](URL on six of South Koreas financial institutions damaged 32,000 computers. The attacks came at a time of heightened tension with North Korea. It wouldn't take long for the South Korean government to trace those attacks to Pyongyang. And it wouldn't be the last time South Korea would be the victim of a cyber attack. After deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system in 2016, China loudly denounced the move, applying economic pressure and unleashing a [series of cyber attacks](URL The Chinese military term for this sort of campaign is [weishe](URL (), which can be translated as either deterrence or compellence. While it failed to persuade South Korea to drop THAAD, it gave a taste of what China is prepared to dounofficially, of coursein support of its policies. Cyber warfare also bled into traditional battlefields. In 2014 Ukrainian artillery officers fighting Russian-backed opposition forces used an app to direct howitzer fire. The app was hacked by Russian group [Fancy Bear](URL and an infected version was distributed with embedded spyware. The spyware gave away the users' location, and Ukrainian officers found their positions [coming under highly accurate enemy fire](URL guided by the hijacked app. But if Russia has cyber skills, so too does the United States. After a U.S. drone was shot down over the Strait of Hormuz in June 2019, President Trump [called off airstrikes](URL against Iran due to risk of casualties. But that didn't stop the U.S. from immediately [hitting Iranian missile and rocket forces](URL with its own cyber attack, putting them out of action for an unknown length of time. ### A Utility Vulnerability A blackout in Ukraine in 2015.MAX VETROVGETTY IMAGES Shutting down the power grid via cyber attack has long been the stuff of techno thrillers and [media scare stories](URL but the nightmare became real in 2015 when [BlackEnergy](URL malware hit Ukrainian electricity supplies, [leaving over 200,000 people without power](URL The attack, allegedly carried out by Russia, affected the SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Advisory) system which controls distribution, disconnecting substations from the grid. It could only be overcome by switching to manual control. The BlackEnergy incident is the first known case of a cyber attack taking down power distribution, but it will surely not be the last. Security agencies report that Russia has [made intrusions into the U.S. energy infrastructure](URL since 2016. They may even [be behind attacks](URL this September. While the attacks didn't cause any outages, they did cause ""blind spots"" for grid operators for about half a day. The electricity kept flowing, but it was a wake-up call that such systems aren't as safe as previously thought. ### Democracy In the Crosshairs SAUL LOEBGETTY IMAGES But the attacks that grabbed the most headlines came from malware attacks, often perpetrated by intelligence agencies using cybercrime to cloak activities. Ransomware, a type of malware which locks up a computer and encrypts data so the user can only get their information back by paying off the attacker, has been around for a while. But in 2017, there were three particularly damaging ransomware vectors: Petya, NotPetya, and Wannacry. All were closely related, and a White House official described NotPetya as [""the most destructive and costly cyber attack in history](URL Strangely, the malware seemed to be corrupted, and victims could not pay the ransom even if they tried. But the twist came when the software was revealed to be a sabotage tool masquerading as ransomware. Eventually, [the NSA pointed the finger at Russia](URL though, ironically, the exploit which it was based on had been previously discovered by the NSA itself. Similarly, an attack in 2018 which hijacked details of some 500 million people from the Marriott Hotels data stores looked like the work of criminals. But the intrusion was [traced to a Chinese intelligence agency](URL apparently as part of their efforts to sweep up data to target significant individuals. The 2010s was also the decade when democracy itself came under attack from the internet. Russia in particular has been identified as the source of [covert meddling in elections](URL and [increasing numbers of Russian chatbots](URL have been identified pushing Putins agenda on social media around the world. These machines are supplemented by an army of humans at Russias ""troll factory""  officially the [Internet Research Agency](URL in St Petersburgwhere staff are paid to engage in online discussions in blogs and comments sections, repeating arguments and spreading disinformation. The IRA even have their [own fake blogs and news sites](URL backed by software to generate large numbers of post views toma boost their rankings. The full impact of this interference, and direct cyberattacks such as those [directed at voter registration](URL in several U.S. states, has yet to be established. ### Up Next: A Growing Threat Military operations during Cyber Blitz 2019, an exercise for practicing cyber operations.ERIC THOMPSON Considering all this unseen digital malfeasance, the U.S. military finally got serious about cyber warfare in the 2010s. [Cyber Command](URL (aka USCYBERCOM), a tiny outfit in 2010, achieved the status of a [unified combatant command](URL led by a four-star general in 2017. This puts it on a level with Strategic Command, which co-ordinates nuclear forces. USCYBERCOM similarly draws together Army, Navy, and Air Force elements (as well as Marine Corps and Coast Guard) and now has more than 6,000 personnel in 133 teams. USCYBERCOM was initially conceived as being used for defense but can now carry out a full spectrum of military cyberspace operations, includes offensive measures. Naturally, its capabilities are secret and its operations are not disclosed. But some details are known such as Operation Glowing Symphony, a successful [campaign against ISIS](URL that brought down the terrorist groups media operation, taking out websites, mobile apps, and communications. Increasingly, the military see cyberspace as an additional domain alongside air, land, and sea. But it's a battlefield where skirmishes are fought without war ever being declared, and an adversary never fully known. Any future war is likely to include cyber attacks as well as physical ones. In many ways, the 2010s for cyber feel like what the 1910s were for aviation during WW1. While air forces made up only a tiny section in the U.S. Army before the Great War. it rapidly grew until it became key aspect of modern warfare by mid-century. In a couple decades, cyber warfare might become the deciding factor between who wins and who loses."

Geoffrey S. Berman, the usa lawyer for the Southern District of new York, introduced that STANISLAV VITALIYEVICH LISOV, a/k/a Black, a/ok/a Blackf (LISOV), turned into sentenced to forty eight months behind bats today for conspiring of installation and use a form of malicious software called NeverQuest to contaminate the computer systems of unwitting victims, steal their login data for on-line banking accounts, and use that information to thieve cash out of the victims accounts. NeverQuest has been accountable for millions of dollars worth trough hackers and attempts to steal cash out of from his victims bank accounts. LISOV turned into sentenced through U.S. District judge Valerie E. Caproni, who presided over his guilty plea earlier this year. In advance this year, Lisov pleaded responsible to at least one depend of conspiracy to dedicate computer hacking, related to attempts to steal at the least $4.4 million from masses of victims using the NeverQuest banking trojan. Similar to every other complicated banking Trojan, NeverQuest, aka Vawtrak or Snifula, has additionally been designed to allow attackers remotely manipulate infected computer systems and steal a huge variety of sensitive information. Besides stealing login information for internet banking or different financial accounts he also use a keylogger or net form injection techniques, the malware was additionally capable of stealing passwords saved in FTP customers, personal keys, or stored within remote-computer settings. In 2014, several people were convicted and indicted due to connection using Neverquest in attack thru web-injection that resulted in more than $1.5 million in fraudulent transactions on StubHub, the online ticket portal. The Trojan has evolved cybersecurity firm PhishLabs noted that Neverquest2 uses a new domain generate algorithm that produce large number of domain names that could be used to link on its command-and-control server. Another recent modification to Neverquest2, ASERT observed, has been introduce of new modules to add Trojan new functionality. Two modules added to Neverquest2 over the summer include a backconnect and plugin for stealing-certificate. The backconnect module (bc\_32.dll) adds support for general purpose remote access to an infected client. It includes a VNC server that can be installed on the infected host, according to ASERT. The infected computer allows an attacker to logged into computer and see victims desktop and get access to the webcam video, see the browsing history of the victim. Full access control to the victims PC and can run arbitrary CMD commands and interact with the Task Manager, according to an ASERT researcher. The second additional module (dg\_32.dll) is a general purpose information stealing module that will hunt for and steal certificates stored on the victims infected computer. The dg\_32.dll plugin uses the CertOpenSystemStore() and related cryptographic APIs to gain access to certificate stores associated with private keys, certificate authorities, etc. It will scan the infected system for browser profiles, cookies, browsing history and browser cache entries, according to ASERTs report. ASERT said the improved Neverquest2 can also remotely access an infected system to install the Pony Trojan, also referred to as Fareit. NeverQuest have become so famous among financially influenced hackers and scammers that the banking trojan become ranked the number two worldwide financial malware in 2015 and primary in 2016. U.S. attorney Geoffrey S. Berman stated: Stanislav Vitaliyevich Lisov, a Russian hacker, used malware to contaminate victims computers, gain their login credentials for online banking accounts, and steal cash from their accounts. This kind of cybercrime threatens private privacy and harms financial institutions. Lisovs arrest, extradition, conviction, and jail sentence must send within an unmistakable message about this offices firm commitment to prosecuting hackers  domestic and overseas alike. Mr. Berman praised the superb investigative efforts of the Federal Bureau of investigation. the problem is being treated by means of the workplaces complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit. Except developing and deploying NeverQuest for his own personal enrichment, Lisov was also responsible for preserving and renting out botnet servers that contained a list of nearly 1.7 million stolen login credentialsalong with usernames, passwords, and security questions and answers. The conspiracy to devote computer hacking charge consists of a most sentence for five years in jail under the terms of a plea deal Lisov struck with the Justice department in February this year while he pleaded responsible. In line with the allegations Indictment to LISOV pled responsible and public courtroom filings, and statements made in court: NeverQuest is a form of malicious software program, or malware, referred to as a banking Trojan that can be delivered to victims computer systems through social media websites, phishing emails, or file transfers. Once surreptitiously hooked up on a victims computer, NeverQuest is able to identify when his victim tried to log onto an online banking internet site then switch the victims login credentials  which includes his or her username and password  returned to a pc server that used to manage the NeverQuest malware. As soon as surreptitiously hooked up, NeverQuest enables administrators remotely and manipulate a victims pc, log into the victims online banking or different financial accounts, transfer cash to different accounts, exchange login credentials, write on-line checks, and buy items from on line carriers. Among June 2012 and January 2015, LISOV become accountable for key elements of the creation and management of a network of victim computers known as a ""botnet that was infected with NeverQuest Malware, amongst other matters, LISOV maintained infrastructure for his criminal organization, which includes through renting and purchasing computer servers that used to control botnet and network that had been compromised by NeverQuest. Those computer servers contained lists with approximately 1.7 million stolen login credentials  which includes usernames, passwords, and security questions and solutions  for victims accounts on internet banking system and other financial websites. LISOV had administrative-level access to those servers. LISOV also individually harvested data login from unwitting victims of NeverQuest malware, consisting of usernames, passwords, and security questions and answers.

I looked around online for some info, a particular line to report cybercrime locally, an office, pretty much anything but didn't see much. I stumbled upon a document from a national police assocation about how they need to improve their knowledge and ability to handle these things on a local level. Things like using private companies, recruiting from local colleges, etc. I decided to swing by the headquarters rather than call to see if I can get some answers. The initial answer I received from a gentlemen at the front desk was ""I've been here 2 years and never heard one mention of cybercrime unfortunately"", the other dude thought I was trying to report a crime and when he realized I wasn't he didn't have much to add. After them trying to figure it out for a few mins a voice form the back yells out that they sometimes will have cybercrime detectives in the building. This gentlemen had a little more knowledge but not much and just knew they existed and dealt with mostly revenge porn, stalking and financial crimes like CC fraud etc. None of them could find a contact for one of these detectives or knew when they might be there. It was Saturday so I didn't expect anyone there that day, thought I could maybe pull a direct phone number from them. Basically it ended with them asking me to come back Monday when more people were available. They never asked my name or for me to identify myself in anyway, gave up a lot of unnecessary information and are clearly not trained in any meaningful way on social engineering etc. I am going to go back tomorrow and see what else I can find out, maybe talk to one of these detectives. I don't know if anyone else is interested in this but I found it pretty revealing and concerning at the same time. My intention is to find out how they contract out work to private companies and what kind of services they look for. If there is any interest I'll post an update. Has anyone else looked into this locally or have more info about it? Thanks."

Why? Fraudsters are becoming more sophisticated at identifying targets and crafting messages that evade traditional secure email gateways. And humans, despite an avalanche of warnings and millions spent on security awareness training, continue to make flawed decisions about what is trustworthy and what simply is not. ## Zero Trust Does Not Work Zero Trustthe security principle that everything inside and outside a network needs to be validated before gaining accesscan harden systems against external and internal attacks that lead to data breaches, embezzlement, fraud, and other malicious activities. In terms of machine interaction, its effective. But add people to a system and things change. Criminals know that people are the weakest point in most systems, so they go after them. Last year, there were more than [22 phishing attacks sent every minute ](URL every day. These organized fraudsters also know that security is always evolving, so they continuously adjust their techniques to avoid detection by SEGs and appear more convincing to their targets. So in a world full of headlines about scams and cons, why are people so trusting? Stanford business professor Roderick M. Kramer wrote in the Harvard Business Review that not only do we come into the world hardwired to trust the people around us, but most of us go on to [treat trust as a one-time decision](URL which we dont revisit when we get new information. If weve decided to trust emails from the CFO, we keep on trusting them, even when an urgent request to make a secret wire transfer seems a little off. Once weve decided to trust the emails sent from our Director of Human Resources, it takes something big to make us change our mind. The same can be true of third-parties youve worked with in the past and big-name brands you know and love. This drive to trust can, and often does, override anti-phishing training, which is why [30% of trained recipients will still open a malicious email](URL Not only do many people fall for phishing even after training, but they also mistake a lot of legitimate messages for fraud. Our [own survey](URL recently found that worldwide, over half of phishing reports sent by employees to SOCs are false positives. Triaging each false positive report eats up nearly six hours of SOC analyst time. Cybercriminals are taking advantage. Millennialsnow the largest generation of workers and consumershave the most confidence that they can spot phishing attempts. Unfortunately, theyre also [more than twice as likely as older adults to get phished](URL So long as deceptive messages make it into inboxes, phishing attacks will succeed, and SOC teams will spend hours triaging both legitimate and false alarms. Clearly, the traditional approach is not working. ## Phishing Fallout Beyond Direct Losses The [average loss per successful BEC attack](URL is $1.3 million. And because 96% of data breaches now start with a malicious email according to the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report, there is also the potential for higher breach-related losses stemming from phishing. Lets not forget the potential loss of employment for executives deemed responsible, loss of shareholder value, and loss of money by consumer victims of brand-impersonation attacks. When customers get scammed, they often take their business elsewhere, driving up churn rates and customer acquisition costs. In financial services, a popular target for phishing and account takeover scams, [28% of customers leave their bank ](URL unauthorized account activity. For all industries, Deloitte projects a [30% rise in customer attrition after a company has a cybercrime incident](URL with above-normal attrition rates for the next three years. Theres harder to quantify relationship damage too, as brands involved in email scams experience the kind of press that simply cannot be considered good press. Consumers who see new stories about data breaches or warnings from the FTC may avoid those brands going forward. Making matters worse, email can see a drop in ROI if customers stop opening messages because they cannot trust the safety of them. ## A Smarter Approach to Email Security Relying on end-users to decide who to trust in the inbox is a setup for costly losses. Email security focused entirely on detecting the bad will always be forced to play catch-up when new types of attacks emerge. Between the rapid evolution of tactics and the constant nature of human behavior, is complete email security possible? We believe that it is, and it requires a radical change in approach.

Obviously, youd take your time to prepare for it. There are many reasons to prepare for that job interview. First, you want to show the interviewers that you have what it takes to be given that job. Also, you want to sell yourself to the interviewers for you to beat other interviewees. But what about when you have received an invitation to attend a specific conference or when you decide to attend a conference of your desire, what would you do about it? You just play by the old rules and prepare for it. Just as the speakers in the conference prepare to give their talks, the attendees also need to prepare for that talk. There is usually something crucial that is being discussed in that conference means that you should be ready to gain as much as you can from it. Well, June 1st and 2nd will be days for the International Conference on Cyber Crime and Legal Compliance. In this conference, a lot of topics will be discussed to help business owners and institutions stay safe from the threats and attacks from cyber crimes. So, if you are planning to attend, you will need to be ready for it. In this article, we will be talking about the things that will help you be well prepared for the cybercrime and legal compliance conference. Without wasting any time, lets jump right in, shall we? **Getting Ready for the Conference** **1.** **Prepare in Advance** Too many times, people make the wrong mistakes because they fail to plan in advance. If you want to get the best of the conference on cybercrime and legal compliance, youll need to start planning as soon as now. If you already planned to attend it, you are on the right track. One thing that you need to know about this conference is that it has a limited attendee number of only 300 people. This number includes students and regular visitors. This is an international conference; so many people will be attending it. You can imagine the whole world is invited, but only 300 people will get seats at the conference. You dont want to wait until the eve of the conference so that you can try booking a seat. Without any doubt, all the seats will be sold out at that time. The world is well dominated by technology, so IT is an important topic in most organizations and businesses. You dont know how many institutions will send reps to that conference. Therefore, you need to buy the tickets to the conference as soon as now. [Click here](URL to buy the tickets online. The site is in Georgian Kartuli Ena, but you can use the Google translate feature to translate the entire page. For the record, a ticket for regular attendees is 350GEL, which is approximately $129. On the other hand, students will need to pay 200GEL that converts to around $78. When you have your ticket ready, you stand a better chance of attending the conference without any failure or disappointment. **2.** **Consider Your Priorities/Why Do You Want to Go?** It is one thing to book a ticket for the conference and another to have a reason for going. Some plan to go so that they can learn about cybersecurity and how to curb the common cybercrimes. Others consider going for the sake of learning legal compliance. Still, there are others who consider attending a conference a hobby. Such people would never want to miss any conference regardless of what it is about. The conference freaks are usually knowledge hungry, and they just want to learn something new. They dont need to apply it anywhere, but they want to stock up their knowledge library with new content. Be sure of why you want to go to the conference before you even pay that ticket. **3.** **Consider What Your Business /Institution Needs** Do you manage a specific institution or business? What are the challenges you are facing that youd like the conference to help you fix them? In this case, you will need to highlight the challenges of your institution or business. Is it common malicious attacks from online activities? Does your system keep on being hacked by unknown people? Does your institution or business short of data security? Have there been data breaches in your business? Maybe you just want to educate your IT team and make them understand the cybersecurity better. It could also be for your personal gain. You must be able to determine the challenges facing your business or institution based on IT or legal compliance. When you find these issues, you can know how you will benefit from the conference. The conference will touch on many things including the sensitive issues for data protection security, the regulations, risks, and norms of cybersecurity. You will also know how to prevent data breaches, economic sanctions, and cybercrime from attacking your business or institution. Ensure that you consider the challenges of your business and how the conference will solve them in the end. **4.** **Prepare Your List of Questions** Well, you should know that this international conference will have a question and answer session with the main speakers. At this point, you can ask the speakers whatever questions that relate to internet security and legal compliance. In this case, you can start writing down the questions that youd ask the main speakers. Write as many questions as you want, but ensure that they are related to IT and legal compliance. This will help you prepare for the conference and also ensure that you go back with enough information from the conference. **5.** **Contact Any Person You Want to Meet Before the Conference** Okay, you are not going for a meet-and-greet event. However, there is always that person or people that youd love to meet at the conference. In this case, you can try contacting them ahead to time to meet them before the conference kicks off. If it is a prominent person, it would be better to reaching out to them ahead of time. During the conference, it is always difficult to meet them and have a one-one conversation because they will be busy sharing what they have with the attendees. Whether you have a mutual connection with the person, blood relation, or you just want to meet them for being notable people in the industry, ensure that you meet them before the conference. Luckily, there are three or so weeks left to the event; so you have enough time to plan for a meeting. **6.** **Finish Your Work Early/Delegate** If you want to get the most of the international cybercrime and legal compliance conference, you will need to be focused enough. Suppose you have a junk of work, try to finish it early to avoid having to work as you attend the conference. Today, business persons use their phones to work, which lets them get the business going using their mobile phones. When you are at the conference, you might want to keep your phone away and focus on what is being taught at the conference. The only time you will be using the phone is when you want to connect online with the other attendees and experts there. By the way, there will be a chance to network with IT and law experts at the conference, where you can connect with them online and learn more from them. But you can use the phone to record an audio or even video. However, you will need to confirm if it is okay to record, especially the video recordings. If you are allowed to record videos, use that chance to record the conference for future references. You can even use the Facebook Live feature to host the conference to your team back in the business/institution. But since this is a paid conference, you might not be allowed to do so. Either way, it never hurts to ask. **7.** **Be Open-Minded** One of the reasons for going to the international conference for internet security and legal compliance is to learn something new. For this reason, you will need to have an open mind. Get ready to be challenged by other people there. Even if you are an IT guru, dont go to the conference with the aim of showing everybody else how knowledgeable you are. Suppose the speaker states something that you had a different opinion on, do not cut her short and show other attendees how wrong the speaker is. Here is why you should meet the speaker earlier before the conference starts. If you specifically are there for the cybercrime needs, dont just stay in that circle. Instead, you can try to learn something else from other attendees at the conference. For instance, you can share your management skills with someone else who runs a business or institution. Keep in mind that there might be other attendees, even students, who know something that can benefit you and your business. **8.** **Remember Why You Are There** This point connects to the first and the seventh points. You already know why you are going to the conference. Mostly, it is because you want to learn something from the speakers and the other attendees. You are NOT THERE TO COMPETE. Therefore, dont go with an aggressive attitude or else you will end up not learning what is taught at the conference. Be friendly, share ideas, and pick up useful points that you would apply back in your business or institution. **9.** **Utilize Any Promising Moment** Well, this conference will attract 300 people from different places. Out of the 300, you can be sure of meeting some that you will automatically connect. If you happen to find yourself in a moment that you get the chance to develop a friendship, utilize it to the maximum. That friendship that you despise might lead to a future relationship. Here, you can even meet to start something that can lead to international success. If it is starting an IT company together to joining heads to better an existing institution or business, ensure that you utilize the chance to the maximum. **10.** **Consider the Aftermath** How do you see your business will be after the conference, what do you plan to do after the conference? Will you connect with one of the students at the conference and hire them in your company? Do you plan to share the knowledge with your team when you get back and teach them all that you learned at the conference? How do you plan to solve the existing challenges in your business with what you were taught at the conference on cybersecurity and legal compliance? Consider all these factors and be sure of how you will handle it all after you get back. Regardless of what you want to do, ensure that you benefit to the fullest after the conference is over. Always have a plan of what you want to do after the conference. **11.** **Understand the IT \[and law\]Terms** Im not saying that you should start taking a course in IT. But, you need to have a clue about the common IT terms. You see, there will be two main speakers at the conference. One speaker is a former Head of the Public Defender Service of England and Wales (Gaynor Ogden Sutton), who will talk about legal compliance. The other main speaker is a co-founder of CySec (cybersecurity) Cyber Educational Center (Maka Petriashvili), who will be speaking about cybersecurity. These experts will regularly use IT and law terms, so you should be familiar with them before you attend the conference. Above all, you can learn some Georgian Kartuli Ena because the conference will be held at the Old Tbilisi Hotel, Tbilisi. You might find it helpful to learn a few basic phrases of the local language. Also, ensure that you have the local currency when going to the conference. Have enough money that you will use for accommodation, dinner, and breakfast. The conference only offers lunch. Take your time to study the area and where you will be spending your night if you are a visitor. So, what else would you advise a person going to the conference to do? Any ideas? Your comments are highly welcomed."

33,cybercrime,cybersecurity,Need help with solving this IT security scenario!,10,6w446k,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/6w446k/need_help_with_solving_this_it_security_scenario/,2017-08-26 16:24:54,"Hi all, I recently came across a scenario regarding IT security. I am new to this area and my knowledge is limited so I'm not sure if my answer to the scenario is suitable or not. Will really appreciate if anyone could point out any issues with my answer and make suggestions. So the scenario is: A small company decided to move their infrastructure to the cloud. During the process they found out one of the database servers has 4 unknown local windows users on it. This triggered a technical review and internal investigation. The issues found were: There were 4 local unknown users created on the server. There were a total of 30 database level users on MS SQL database. 20 web applications stored within the db. Of the 20 web applications 5 were compromised, where 1 site was having command injection issues 1 site was having SQL injection issues 1 site was having XSS and CSRF issues 2 sites were not doing any input validation None of the sites were using HTTPS Two of the database were found to have credit card information Am I correct to assume that the company has security issues with application? Because: The users are created via web applications and stored in the database server, the company have yet to identify the privileges of the 4 unknown users. Any one or all of these unknown users could have malicious intentions. They could be identified as individuals with unauthorised access to the companys network, which means the company may have already being a victim of data breach or data theft. Database server has 20 web application connected. This makes it easier for an attacker to access the data because they only need to crack the administrator account for one server to have access to everything. Sites with command injection, SQL injection, XSS and CSRF are all application security vulnerabilities which attackers can exploit and facilitate cybercrime. In result attackers could target availability, confidentiality, and or integrity of the companys data. During the investigation it is also found that two database contained credit card information and none of the sites were using HTTPS. This looks like the attacker have already started to steal data as the security on the sites are disabled and ask users for credit card information. The company should also review the system logs for any failed authentication attempts, find out the vulnerabilities and know how fix the vulnerability. Thanks!"
34,cybercrime,cybersecurity,Are there cybersecurity jobs where you can see some action on the field?,3,5z65p6,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/5z65p6/are_there_cybersecurity_jobs_where_you_can_see/,2017-03-14 03:59:10,"Hi guys, I'm just curious if there are any cybersecurity jobs out there where your job would be let's say half on the computer and half on the field? Kinda like a police officer with IT skills? I'd love to be able to blend technical IT skills and also get the chance to interact with people. Like some kind of cybercrime investigator who would also be sworn as a peace officer or carry a weapon. Maybe I'm dreaming, but I'm very curious what are the possibilities! I look forward to your answers! Thanks! "
35,cybercrime,cybersecurity,What kind of attack might this be?,1,3n44vz,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/3n44vz/what_kind_of_attack_might_this_be/,2015-10-02 01:49:12,"One of my employees is the victim of some kind of cybercrime. For the last few weeks, she has dealt with thieves calling her credit union, posing as her, and requesting wire transfers. She has changed account numbers there twice, and still they find out her account numbers THE SAME DAY and attempt to steal from her. So she changed banks completely, and immediately after the first time she used her new debit card, several fraudulent charges showed up on her account from use of her card number. This may or may not be related: Just before all this started, we were staffing a table at an outdoor festival, and both she and her boyfriend noticed a message on their Android phones that seemed to indicate that their phones had been bluesnarfed. My employee thinks she remembers seeing something being installed. She has since hard reset the phone (I think yesterday). The FBI is not helping because she hasn't actually lost any $$ so far because of the vigilance of the banks, but it seems like it's only a matter of time before they clean her out unless she can defeat whatever access they have. Any ideas? Thanks!"
