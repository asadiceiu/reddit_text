1,cyber crime,SampleSize,[Results][Casual] Online Security - How Secure Are You? (All),24,5yotit,https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/5yotit/resultscasual_online_security_how_secure_are_you/,2017-03-11 08:20:42,"Hello /r/SampleSize! **Quick disclaimer:** This post contains links to various informative articles on **our site - [FatSecurity.com](URL - and we hope that these articles will serve as a delicious ""side dish"" for the main course of survey results below. *The mods approved this post in advance.* --- --- #[Results][Casual] Online Security - How Secure Are You? (All) Raw results: URL Imgur gallery with additional insights: URL At the bottom of this post you can find a few articles with useful information and advice. For the lazy, I also laid out the entire imgur post here with additional notes. --- --- #Background --- 134 people took the survey, out of which I analyzed 128 (5 filled it out after I already began the analysis, and 1 was a troll :) ) --- URL Age distribution among all survey takers: ~85% are 32 or younger. --- URL **50% of survey takers have been affected by cyber crime at some point of their life**. This includes falling for online scams or phishing, losing data to ransomware and experiencing any other type of malware infection. Just consider these results with the age distribution of the survey takers - **these are not old people who rarely browse the web...** --- --- #Antivirus and Anti-Malware --- URL Over 50% use a third party software, and **20% don't use any antivirus software**. *6 out of 90 Windows users said they don't use any antivirus software, so I guess they don't know about Windows Defender. These 6 belong under ""Native"" even though this graph includes them under ""None"" - this means that 4.5% should move from the grey to the orange section.* **Recommendation:** Use a good real-time antivirus, even if it's just a free one. Find out which antivirus is best by reviewing [independent lab test scores over time](URL --- URL For every Paid 3rd party antivirus user, there are 2 Free antivirus users. **Recommendation:** Make sure that the free antivirus you're using isn't holding back crucial features. most antivirus vendors offer a free trial and/or money back guarantee for their paid products, for a limited period of time. Give it a shot - just make sure it's a reliable antivirus software. --- URL Overall, 1 of every 6 survey takers paid for antivirus software. --- URL When measuring the antivirus usage among the 3 main age groups there are minor (possibly not statistically significant) differences: * Users under 25 appear to be less prudent: ~25% without any antivirus. * Users over 18 are more likely to pay for an antivirus subscription: ~21% with a paid antivirus vs. ~16% among users under 18. --- URL **Almost 60% don't use any second-opinion anti-malware scanner**, even though these scanners could be vital in discovering malware which an antivirus doesn't... Furthermore, the really good ones have a free version! --- URL ...and out of the ~40% of those who DO use an anti-malware scanner, **Over 90% use MalwareBytes**. To me it's interesting because MalwareBytes has a great reputation online. Despite that reputation and from my personal experience with users who asked us for assistance, other scanners such as Zemana AntiMalware and HitManPro occasionally found and removed malware which MalwareBytes missed altogether. Now this might be anecdotal because I only recall a few cases like this, but we **did** find that [the signature engine of MalwareBytes is lacking](URL **Recommendation:** Install at least one anti-malware scanner, even a free one. You won't enjoy real-time protection with a free version, but you'll be able to run an occasional scan to get a second opinion about your antivirus. --- --- #Backup --- How about backing up the stuff that matters? URL **26% of users don't back up their data at all**, and only ~41% use more than one backup layer. **Recommendation:** Back up your important documents/files/photos/whatever to at least one online service and at least one portable device. Prevention in the form of reliable backup is the best way to ensure you won't lose your data. --- --- #Password Discipline --- URL Another important aspect of your security habits is **changing the passwords for your WiFi and Router** from their default ones. 54% of users changed both of those, while 32% didn't change either one of those. **Recommendation:** Change your default passwords, and while you're at it, secure the access to your network hardware such as your printer or your webcam. Start with these subs and broaden your horizons regarding unsecured hardware: * /r/controllablewebcams * /r/controllableprinters --- URL **Password discipline** is also very important when it comes to using passwords for online services, like your email or Facebook account. 70% of users tend to use diverse passwords, while 30% use the same password for a big part or even all of the services to which they subscribe. **Recommendation:** Use different and non-default passwords for everything - keep track with a good password manager. --- URL **2-Step verification** is becoming more and more popular among online services. It seems that the awareness for this is high - only 5% aren't sure they're using it which tells me they don't really know what it is. 78% are using this extra security layer on at least one online service, which means to me that they understand the importance of it. --- --- #Vigilance --- URL **10% of users aren't checking the link preview** to see where the link they're about to click leads. That's one *hell* of a way to get phished for your details. --- URL **Only 54% always recognize shortened links** such as **bit.ly** and **goo.gl**. This also all but guarantees that a significant portion of users might easily fall for a scam online. **Recommendation:** Online (and offline) scams are abundant - visit /r/scams for some examples. --- --- All the recommendations above and more good security tips can be found in our article about [protecting yourself online](URL Additional recommended reading on our site: * [Tech support scams](URL * [Ransomware protection guied](URL **Remember:** There's usually a *good-enough* free alternative to any paid service, so being frugal is no excuse for overlooking secure online behavior.
