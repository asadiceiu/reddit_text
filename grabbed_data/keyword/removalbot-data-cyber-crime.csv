You can beg, like on Instagram you pretend your doing really well and when people ask people for the secret to your success you tell them about the mad gainz bro and scam them that way. Most people do. Thats not very profitable though. Or you could get into the cyber crime business. Its basically a criminal token and how criminals keep score. Ransomware is quite lucrative. Have a look at how the dark web works. Or you could do an ICO shitcon exit scam and launder all the money through some exchange but these arent as profitable as they once were. Theres too many of them. Or you could just set up a fake shitty exchange and then run away with the profits. Lots of ways you can make real money out of this scam.

We believe it is someone from the family, so we sent the hacked relatives to the police but they have refused to file FIR. They want some bribe so they can just let us know who these people are but they wont file an FIR. Since we stay in UAE , our only option is now is to go to any private cyber crime investigator who can find out who these people really are. So would really appreciate if someone can guide me to reputed cyber crime investigators. I am ready to pay all reasonable charges for their service. Tldr: Someone is hacked our relative's phone and is threatening and harrasing us through insta and hacked whatsapp. Police refuses to file FIR. Need info of good cyber crime investigators.

The short answer is that its possible, but difficult. The long answer is that ongoing developments in the regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrency may offer victims more recourse going forward. Those who have fallen victim to crypto-currency heists either through mismanaged exchanges or hacks have the option of filing a complaint with the FBIs Cyber Criminal Unit or other law enforcement agencies. An obstacle in going this route is the lack of emphasis placed on recovering stolen Bitcoin; to date, no one has received jail time for hacking an exchange or electronically syphoning digital currency. Broadly speaking, law enforcement agencies remain undecided as to whether or not stealing digital currency constitutes a crime but the good news is that their are individuals and agencies out there that do a good job with bitcoin and other cryptocurrency recovery, infact i did not believe this to be true till michael veksler recovered some bitcoins stolen from my PC, and the whole process was simple and fast. i would honestly recommend you contact michael (www Bitcoinrecoveryspytech {.}com) for cryptocurrency recovery.

It is true that plenty of other developed nations have no free speech, but don't make the mistake of thinking that situation has no downsides, and can exist in a vacuum. For one thing, America has been exporting its culture for decades. You'd be surprised how many people in non-American countries think they have a first amendment or equivalent. It comes as a surprise to them to learn that they do not. Such a widespread belief though is powerful in that it shapes the minds of the politicians, judges, juries and police. If its 'bad' to arrest someone for speech, then you'll avoid arresting people for speech. Take away America and its first amendment indoctrination. Watch how quickly other nations lose the ""oh we shouldnt do that"" attitude, and there is no safety net (law) underneath. Then it becomes ""oh you shouldn't say that"" and 'that' keeps expanding. China is an ok look at the issue, but even China probably stays its hand a little so as not to make the Americans look too good. Once its a free for all of banning and punishing speech, yeh you're fucked. You might be wondering why I called you a fascist. The first job of a fascist is to establish control and fear. Fascists fear speech more than anyone, because it weakens their control and exposes their scaremongering to the light. Of course its difficult for any group to establish control of language, so you must make it palatable first. SO you must find an emotional angle to use. This is the same reason that reality TV is back-to-back sop stories. Cancer and broken homes and all kinds of shit. Fastest way to the objective. So naturally the first step of the fascist is to maybe suggest something like 'hate speech crime'. Who wants to defend the vile rubbish that spews forth from some poorly educated roid fuelled skinhead? Who wants to have their own personal integrity called into question for the higher ideals that nobody else seems to care about? To have the whispers going around ""oh, he must secretly support that if he is defending them""? I'm not upset that my country has laws against hate speech. There are too many ways authority can be abused for me to worry about that particular angle. But I believe wholeheartedly that the greatest boost the racists ever receive, is in poorly balanced justice. If a [white] man is ever convicted of a hate speech crime, but other men cannot be convicted for anti-white speech, you've just trebled the recruitment for hatred. If you can go to prison or be fined for saying nasty things about Islam, but nobody ever goes to prison for saying nasty things about Christianity, you've quadrupled the supply of religious zealots. You might think ""that is fine, we'll just punish anti-white and anti-christian language"". Great. Lets see how that turns out- a majority in a democracy that has the power to punish anyone who criticises elements of the majority's culture. And then it gets fucked up even worse- Scientology. Where do we stand on that? Is it ok to call them a money grubbing cult? Or in the interests of fairness, do they now get the power to silence their critics? Only a fascist or someone doing their bidding could support the suppression of free speech. Things LOOK ok in other nations because THEY HAVE NO FREEDOM OF SPEECH YOU FUCKING IMBECILE! THEY CANT TELL YOU SHIT! Its called a Chilling Effect you fucking omg you have no fucking idea how frustrating it is to be unable to say some things because it could LITERALLY have repercussions. FUCK YOU. The line of thinking ""we can safely control speech"" leads to things like the Aus govt believing it can decide whether its citizens can watch porn, have access to encryption, oh, and they have this whole 'cyber bullying' thing going on. Thats right, lets have government workers decide who a bully is based on what they see on a computer screen. That will end swell. (Pro tip: Government workers have biases too, good luck calling them out) ''' [Context Link](URL [Go1dfish undelete link](URL [unreddit undelete link](URL Author: /u/farking_pko"

For those who can't access the link, this is what this game is about! ^(**First few User Tags for this game: Co-op, Action, FPS, Heist, Online Co-Op**) #About This Game PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree. The new CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands? Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a new character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear. #Key Features - Rob Banks, Get Paid  Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side. - CRIMENET  The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician ""The Elephant"", and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind. - PAYDAY Gun Play and Mechanics on a New Level  Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good. - Dynamic Scenarios  No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events. - Choose Your Skills  As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister. - More Masks than Ever  PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask together with a pattern and a color combination, resulting in millions of different combinations. - Weapons and Modifications  A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine? - Play It Your Way  Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes, to running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, and watch as the heist unfolds accordingly. - New Game Content All the Time  More than 70 updates since release and still going strong with new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts. Every month offers new free content and paid DLC as PAYDAY 2 continues to be developed by the OVERKILL crew until at least 2017.

(self.unitedkingdom) by /u/Michael-INTJ removed from /r/unitedkingdom within 30-35min,1,4yjt5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/removalbot/comments/4yjt5q/0819_1616_only_worth_reading_if_you_have_that/,2016-08-20 02:16:58,"''' Last week I was hit by fraud(conned) out of 410. 410 is due to come out of my bank account, the bank will be charging me 6 per day that the balance isn't corrected, and being unemployed(not from choice or disability), this of course causes a huge problem as I can't afford to correct the balance, I simply don't have the money available right now. I've spent the last few days trying to come up with a viable solution to ensure I don't fall into serious debt with the bank. Considered payday loans but of course, I'm unable to actually get one because I'm unemployed nor do I know anyone who would be a guarantor. Each day the debt will rise higher and higher and there's nothing I can do about it, seemingly. Does anyone have any idea's on how to counter this at all, in any way shape or form without eventually going bankrupt due to the debt reaching a level I simply can't correct, I feel this is quite a serious and possible outcome, one I would like to avoid. I wouldn't be concerned if I was working.. To summarise: 1) Bank account balance 0 2) Bank account balance -410 with +6 per day on top of that until the balance is corrected. Due to happen in the next few days, I managed to pinpoint the date, deadline - 25/08/16, so -410 becomes -416 the next day, -422 the next day so on and so forth. 3) 27 years old and unemployed(again, not from choice or disability), and can't afford to correct the balance in my current situation, and truthfully, I can't rely on family or friends either to help me out. I've already contacted the ""National Fraud &amp; Cyber Crime Centre"", still not had a reply, it takes 28 days for them to fully investigate and then contact me according to the adviser I spoke to again this morning when asking for an update. Also contacted my bank to try and get them to hold off on the fee's with an understanding that I was hit my fraud, they said they can't do that as the payments coming out of my bank account are going through PayPal, so it's classed as a direct debit. I've contacted PayPal and they said they can't do anything as the fraud doesn't actually break PayPal's privacy/security policies etc, and that, and I quote ""your good nature wanting to help somebody is at fault."" We ""PayPal"" can't do anything. It's almost like, foreseeing an accident and not being able to do anything about it, you just have to wait until it's happened and hope the injuries aren't life threatening. And yes, if you can't tell, I'm desperate enough to accept charity on this occasion providing someone is willing enough to assist, if I was too proud to do so given the opportunity, I would be foolish. I've never really asked for anything before in life from anyone, and this isn't something I wanted to do, nor do I enjoy this. If you're in a position to help and wish to do so, simply put, I would be very grateful. And yes for those who are wondering, If I had something of value to sell, I would, as material possessions can always be replaced later on, an uncontrollable debt on the other hand, isn't. If you think you can help but wish to see proof of my above story, I'll be happy to provide screenshots, if necessary. Nevertheless, thanks for reading and for any consideration.
