I think the project's flown beneath the radar for many! Here's the low-down: # Intro The CEO [Gilbert Verdian](URL [founded](URL the ISO TC307 standard for blockchain in April 2016, where [52 countries now collaborate](URL to implement a standard that will be adopted globally. Standards are a pivotal component to adoption, as they essentially represent a commitment made by numerous entities to use a particular technology or format. A key [aim of standardisation](URL is to ensure interoperability between multiple DLT/Blockchain implementations and, in doing so, reduce the risk of a fragmented ecosystem. Gilbert Verdian is the chairman of the SG7 workgroup on ""Interoperability of blockchain and distributed ledger technology systems"". Work into the standard is ongoing and it is planned to be finalised [no later than 2021](URL *Processing img 6igz8bjm9wk21...* [Quant Network](URL aims to provide the technology for enterprise and startups to take advantage of DLT's, by making it possible to connect to blockchains using just 3 lines of code in less than 8 minutes. Unlike other interoperability solutions Overledger [isn't a blockchain](URL and doesnt require fundamental system changes to use the technology. It is more apt to call it a blockchain protocol, comparable to the internet protocol TCP/IP. Overledger facilitates routing between blockchains by using a verification block, which not only helps ensure that consensus times are kept to a minimum, but also handles double spend and forking issues across different ledgers. [ Overledger Architecture Model](URL The team launched Overledger in [November](URL demonstrating 4 multi-chain apps running on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Hyperledger: * [Part 1](URL video (13min) * [Part 2: mApp Demos](URL video (37min) The product is at full release for the Enterprise version of Overledger for permissioned blockchains. The current open source version will be connected to permissionless blockchains by the summer, currently it's test-net only. Overledger can facilitate cross-chain atomic swaps, and Zero Knowledge Proofs are possible using the teams [patented](URL TrustTag solution: Trusttag allows the tokenisation of assets to be used on the blockchain and to easily connect off chain data to onchain. Interoperability is not just limited to transferring value between blockchains via atomic swaps but messages / data can be used by adding a hash of a message to the metadata of a transaction on any blockchain which facilitates the interoperability without having to add another blockchain by utilising the trust and security of the source blockchain. All communication is encrypted on the client side. Overledger is not affected by forks or updates of underlying blockchains, as it abstracts the messaging layer from the transaction layer, sitting above it. Their ICO finished April last year, followed by a [token burn in September](URL as the team only raised $10-11M of their $40M ask. The ICO Price was $1.51 and pre-sale 94c. The first draft of the [Token utility paper](URL was released in January. The Treasury function will be completed by the second half of the year, so we can probably expect an updated Token utility paper between now and then.

5,cyber-crime,CryptoCurrency,"Covesting receives DLT license from Gibraltar Financial Services Commission, but what does it mean?",1,9psiv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9psiv1/covesting_receives_dlt_license_from_gibraltar/,2018-10-20 19:37:47,"Covesting was one of the first exchanges in the world to receive the so-called **DLT** or Distributed Ledger Technology license from the Gibraltar government. In this way, it is able to profile itself as a highly reliable company within the cryptocurrency market. **What is a DLT license?** The DLT license was introduced on 1 January 2018 and is issued by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission. In order to obtain this license, it is necessary for companies to comply with the nine basic principles established by the GFSC: 1. Honesty and integrity: The DLT provider must always behave reliably, honestly and professionally both internally and in its dealings with the public. In addition, the company must not pose a risk to the people and the reputation of Gibraltar. 2. Customer service: Companies wishing to obtain a DLT license must provide excellent customer service. Complaints must be handled correctly and, in addition, there must be clear and transparent communication. 3. Means: Despite the fact that there are no concrete requirements with regard to the available resources, the GFSC wants DLT providers to have both their financial and non-financial affairs in order. This concerns not only the available capital, but also internal procedures that must be followed and any insurance that may be required. 4. Risk management: Not only should sufficient resources be available, a holistic approach to risk management is also required. 5. Protection of customers' assets: One of the most important requirements for being granted a DLT license is related to securing the assets of customers. In particular, securing the available data as well as other technical (security) aspects is crucial for obtaining a DLT license. 6. Clear corporate governance: The principle of clear corporate governance specifically relates to the way the company is run, its internal structures, procedures and strategy. 7. Cyber security: In order to obtain a DLT license, a company must always guarantee rock-solid security. In addition, any threats must be dealt with as effectively as possible and be subject to an audit carried out by an external, specialised party. 8. Financial crime: A DLT provider should always take appropriate actions to comply with the applicable 'know-your-customer' requirements regarding the 'Proceeds of Crime Act 2015'. 9. Resilience: Finally, every company must be able to show the necessary resilience in order to limit losses as much as possible in problem situations. In addition, the impact or inconvenience to customers must always be kept to an absolute minimum. **Benefits for users and investors** The DLT license Covesting has obtained brings a large number of interesting benefits for users and investors. This way one can not only be sure one is working with a reliable and solvent party, but this also guarantees an optimal protection of the invested, financial resources. The DLT license also makes it possible for users to make deposits in fiat money such as euros and enjoy the security that advanced risk management brings. All this ensures that the DLT license not only makes the cryptomarket more reliable, but also more accessible to the general public. **What is Covesting?** Covesting is a cryptocurrency exchange and trading platform that provides users with real-time market data as well as advanced charts. Covesting also offers its users the possibility to copy the trading activities of leading cryptocurrency investors by means of so-called 'copy trading'. This makes the platform suitable for both novice and more experienced traders. Covesting's own COV-token makes it possible for investors to follow professional cryptocurrency traders on its platform. In addition, paying the trading costs with this token provides a discount of 50 percent. This ERC20 utility token also gives access to extra possibilities such as algorithmic trading and arbitrage bots. Finally, users of the Covesting platform can always count on the expertise of an excellent, multilingual 24/7 customer service. &gt;!Use this link and get $50 to cover fees: URL **Upcoming developments** Covesting wants to be a platform that continues to innovate, so were planning many new developments in the (near) future. For example: there is currently a trading competition in which cryptocurrency traders have the opportunity to show off what they can do. The best traders can win 10,000 COV, and at the same time, this competition will demonstrate to other Covesting users which traders might be interesting to follow. Another important addition to the Covesting platform is the introduction of fiat deposits with EUR and GBP, with different exchange pairs on offer. These include BTC/EUR and ETH/EUR. Finally, in October of this year, the COV token burn will start, meaning, as the name suggests, the 'burning' of COV tokens, reducing the already low supply of 20 mln. tokens continuously. Would you also like to make use of a reliable and innovative exchange or are you, as an experienced cryptocurrency trader, keen on winning the trading competition?

6,cyber-crime,CryptoCurrency,"$60M ICO SCAM, uncovered serial perpetrators and credible evidence of money trail to Europe. How and where do I report it to ensure a investigation happens?",1,9sucui,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9sucui/60m_ico_scam_uncovered_serial_perpetrators_and/,2018-10-31 12:38:16,"Feel like Im in a Hitchcock movie All started by trying to find out whats happening to a bad ICO investment and it points to what looks like network of criminal activity. I dont want to be involved but feel I better get the proper authorities to take this seriously and put these criminals where they belong. Really looking for any help or advice what to do. ACChain and Puyin Coin were ICO scams from China. They took &gt; $60M USD (some estimates $100M+) of investor money, 6 arrests were made in Shenzhen China earlier this year, and most associated people disappeared. This was reported in Chinese media as Puyin Coin but the connection to ACChain wasnt made clear and it didnt get picked up outside China. Some links (google translate does an OK job) [URL [URL [URL &gt;""**Police also urged other fugitive suspects to surrender as soon as possible"".** Some not too bright or super greedy members of the project tried to keep the ACChain part of scam going even after the exit and arrests presenting on social media as everything is cool and while the old dumster is still smokin' they are even trying to roll out a third new scam and clearly have money coming in. [URL [URL [URL # Genevieve Leveille and Serena Yin (admitted in own response and validated as the actual people and this is not a Doxing because they put their own names in the post and website etc) Leveille and Yin took control of the ACChain project around January 2018 around the time the original management fled but prior to the China arrests. [URL [URL [URL Leveille has widely claimed on social media and at blockchain events to have raised $23M into a new related venture called Biolifechain.io. The detail of biolifechain would never justify even a $2M presale so it was either a lie or part of a scheme to launder some of the ACChain or Puyin Coin missing funds. [URL Leveille set up 3 new UK companies plus one in the tax haven of Jersey, and information suggests a number of others in Switzerland, Hong Kong and probably elsewhere. These new companies were all set up at around the same time China police were investigating and making arrests [URL [URL [URL [URL My original intention was to publish all the details we found online as a warning but the more I uncovered about this pair the more it looked like serious criminal activity that warrants a federal investigation probably in multiple countries. On top of obvious fraud and securities violations it seems to involve money laundering and tax evasion. I think it needs to be looked at urgently while they are still pushing that latest scam. No expectation of investors getting anything back but just stopping more people getting ripped off would be cool. Leveille, Yin and a group of their supporters (being investigated now and **soon to be named and shamed)** are also clearly not satisfied with what they took so far and are starting and participating in at least 9, **yes NINE other ICO scams**. Im not sure who or where (8 possible locations) to report this and really need local legal advice... PLEASE HELP! 1- Genevieve Leveille and Serena Yin both appear or appeared to live, work or study in the UK at least partially, and Leveille is a director of many UK companies and two ICOs and has addresses there. Doubtful they pay tax anywhere but UK should want to look at their tax. 2- Serena Yin appears to be Chinese national and the biggest scams were original China based. China police (Nanshan District, Shenzhen and later Beijing) are already be engaged and made arrests but our PI advised us with that amount of money Police may have likely been paid to turn a blind eye for some perpetrators. 3- There is a potential money trail leading to Jersey (UK, not NY one) and a company called **ACChain Technology International Services** and Genevieve Leveille uses a number of Jersey addresses so may live or work there. There also appears to be legal action against Leveille in Jersey based on a notice in Jersey papers 4- Genevieve Leveille claims a US passport holder or citizen and many things she did are crimes in the states but we have nothing to link her to a US address, no credit history or employment. She put Columbia University on linkedin but could not be verified or find any photo or anything so probably faked. 5- There are lawsuits against Genevieve Leveille in Singapore and two of her latest ICO Scams appear to be based in Singapore and there were notices in singapore papers too 6- Many of the ACChain and Biolifechain related companies link back to Hong Kong 7- One of her ICOs seems to be Nigeria based and shes supposed to be from Nigeria but everyone knows the Nigeria police wont do shit. 8- The biolifechain ICO has many links and references to Switzerland and there have been a few pointers of money movement there. All this has been uncovered with just a few grand for a private Investigator, a bit of searching and many tips from people that read the thread and chipped in. We probably only see the tip of the iceberg and there may be many more scams and ICOs to find with a more effort. # Full Background Full disclosure, I got eyes on this shitshow because I invested a few grand in ACChain during the ICO phase mid 2017. I invest in a bunch of ICOs lost that sort of money a dozen times I would normally not give a shit. I took a close look of this first because of the fucked up responses they gave on Telegram when the project clearly had stalled or something wrong. Normally an exit scam completely disappear and a failed project will admit some difficulty. This was different. In July got invited to a private group of pissed off investors who showed evidence that valid questions were being censored and users blocked. It was clear something was getting covered up. Since January 2018 it could be clearly seen in GIT (the public source code repository) that **no development** was going on, the team listed on the website apart from Leveille had not been seen or heard of in public for months, but social media kept posting that the project was still going strong and claiming faked awards and other stuff. There was no mention of anyone leaving, any trouble, hacking, nothing.They always said there will be a new release in a few weeks the developers are hard at work but this shit went on for over 6 months and you could see its a lie because nothing in GIT and nobody trading it. What really pissed me is the arrogant and dismissive way Leveille and her admin Robin dealt with investors. Frequently deleting critical posts and in one case referring to someone that asked questions as ***he is a small little man who should not have invested what he could ill afford to loose***. Well fuck that attitude when youre living high off the guys money, so in June I dropped a few grand to get a Hong Kong PI to find out what really happened. The PI connected Puyin Coin owners directly to ACChain via a string of China and HK companies, found the offices which were hastily evacuated got photos, got a bunch of other details on the original team and other evidence clearly showing it all to be a multi part scam. Can read a lot more detail in the other posts. The PI did warn us that they were **threatened by mafia like people** in the course of this investigation. There is well over $60M USD taken so it is very likely some people they do not want to be uncovered and may have bribed China police already. The PI seriously advised us and the other investors to remain anonymous and avoid China. Consider the threats to be very serious even life threatening and this comes from a proper PI. I shared some the information I had with the investors and posted on reddit and **then things got interesting** [URL When the first empty office photos were posted (which are exactly the register China company offices) the ACChain Telegram admins (Wallace and Robin) tried to claim it was all FAKE NEWS and strongly insisted that the project was still going but could not substantiate a thing they said. When investors quizzed the ACChain social media team they were evasive or just blocked or censored the investor. This was so fucked up because they were clearly caught red handed, but they kept trying to keep the scam going for unknown reasons. Days later under pressure to give any evidence they finally posted old photos of the development team at work as their proof. Turned out (own admission) the social media team had never been to China or seen the actual office, they just got paid by Leveille and Yin to keep the social media going and had no connection to the devs or anyone. In the photo, our PI identified one former employee that they had interviewed in person, she had left ACChain in 2017, so the photo they were using as proof was old and proved the opposite. They were trying too hard to keep the cover up. Investors challenged the ACChain team to refute any of this with real evidence and they always got censored or blocked. ACChain were asked to post a video or anything to back up their story which would be so fucking easy if anything they said was true. The photos of the scammers and more of the details the PI dug up were then posted on reddit and got a lot of attention and thousand plus upvotes. [URL Then rather than disappear **Genevieve Leveille doubled down again** ACChain posted a hurried explanation on medium on August 10 and paid for it to be republished on a few blockchain websites, they try to say the details posted on reddit were factually incorrect and they tried to put up a cover story. But they gave no evidence other than a story, and if what they say is true it would be so easy to back it up with evidence. [URL [URL Leveille posted on twitter and even said this [\#Vote](URL up this article [\#help](URL put to [\#shame](URL [\#cowards](URL get the [\#truth](URL This explanation was transparent as fuck. It was immediately debunked and only sunk them deeper. A cover story intended to fool anyone that didnt know the real ACChain history. 1- claimed &gt;""From January 2018 the business started formally restructuring management changed and Genevieve Leveille and Serena Yin claim they were brought in to lead the global development strategy.Obvious coverup because there was no mention of any restructure at the time in January. All through 2018 they claimed the opposite. the key people were due at events (no evidence) and team were still at work (with no updates on GIT)So this is perhaps the only explanation they could make up after the scam was exposed. If it was a restructure then why not get the original team to announce it, oh yeah because theyre **in Jail or hiding from police**. 2- claimed &gt;ACChain was working with a reduced team when a cyber-attack took place in April 2018 and they were investigating and refunding coins.This was never admitted back in April, so if it did happen they covered it up for 3 months. A lot of people on telegram did claim missing coins but they did not get any explanation and the questions were censored or deleted. The way coins were taken clearly pointed to an inside job as it had access to wallet keys, so it was probably the original team coming back to raid the coffers or Levelle and Yin taking it themself. 3- Claimed &gt;hundreds of thousands of voters who voted for ACChain to win the Chainnews 2018 Blockchain Star award in Asia. **This is not possible**. Hundreds of thousands voting has NEVER happened in a blockchain competition. Why would a largely unknown coin get so many votes? Obviously, they paid for the award or used bots or a script to cheat the system.Either way trying to validate themselves with this and the IDAXC was clearly desperation. 4- Claimed &gt;In January 2018, ACChain also received accreditation from IDAXC  the global decentralized digital asset management organisation Which turns out to be a non-existent organization with website under construction. [URL post a fake organization as validation when youre trying to clear your name? [**URL If you google ACChain you see that most of the media picked up the real story and exposed the scam, except ONE [URL Based on the fact that he shilled them before and knows the real background this one conrary post by **Bob Welldon** would indicate ***Bob is complicit in the SCAM*** or intentionally helping them cover it up. He seem to be assisting them in other ways too. A few days after posting on medium all communication from ACChain stopped. It appears the social media team finally figured out they were being scammed too. What all the investors and now the crypto world could not understand is why after the scam had clearly been uncovered did Genevieve Leveille and Serena Yin go to such effort to try to keep the scam going. Thanks to the original telegram article a lot of people helped answer that too. **Genevieve Leveille is involved in at least 9 other ICO scams** and she is flying around the world speaking at events pushing them as much as possible. It suggest she is trying to c*ash out all these other scams as quickly as she can before the ACChain story and her history gets too widely known*. She may be a few months away from disappearing forever back to Nigeria or wherever so got to get her investigated quick.

Themis has some real technology and seems to be raising tens of millions and there is the feel of ACChain about it. Themis refused to comment about how deeply involve Leveille and got evasive about her involvement then removed reference to her. Themis might be the legitimate one of the 9 but this should be enough to avoid them. Themis just removed all the adviser names from their whitepaper so maybe a way to quietly distance themselves from Leveille. The **waybackmachine** never forgets though. The PI could find little background information on Serena Yin like a ghost they said, Genevieve Leveille appears to have a history of scams and crime long before she became involved in ICO scams. The PI found newspaper notices regarding legal action for IP violations and securities fraud in papers in Singapore, UK and Jersey from July to September 2017. A person claiming to be her former co-worker from a bank in the UK said that around October 2017 Leveille was desperately trying to borrow money from anyone to her to pay legal costs claiming she was victim of people ripping her off but soon she was coming into big money. A few months later she was living the high life and pretty clear she learned how to do ICO scams. Leveille is supposed to be a US Citizen of Nigerian origin. Leveille frequently still claims to be founder of UK company 0tentic8 Ltd which Leveille and a partner Duane Gafoor of Hong Kong incorporated in December 2016 and dissolved in August 2017.

High rate of cyber crimes especially on cryptocurrencies related websites and subsequent hacking of credit cards and accounts necessitated the invention of REMME.It is worrisome that despite the invention of the Two-Factor Authentication process for maximum security on the cyberspace, most people are yet to utilize this. The result had been the deployment of phishing as a cyber crime tactics. Hackers have succeeded in using this method to steal both funds and data.These challenges led to the introduction of a suitable platform that will solve the raging insecurity and fraud going on in the cyberspace.

9,cyber-crime,CryptoCurrency,3 interesting cyber-security projects that are blockchain based reviewed by Cyber security geek &amp; crypto supporter,37,8jarqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8jarqf/3_interesting_cybersecurity_projects_that_are/,2018-05-14 18:48:33,"As a dedicated crypto lover and cyber security geek, I have been doing some serious research about cyber security companies that are blockchain based. Unfortunately, there arent so many cyber security projects who are blockchain based as I thought they will be, but having some that are currently up and running still brings some positivity for a cyber security geek like me... **Disclaimer : Im not encouraging nor recommending you to invest at the projects Im reviewing below. Everything that is written over here has been written by me, from a professional perspective and not as investor or trader. Some facts about the industry before we start the review: 1.Cyber crime damage costs to hit $6 trillion annually by 2021. 2.Cyber crime will more than triple the number of unfilled cybersecurity jobs, which is predicted to reach 3.5 million by 2021 3. Global ransomware damage costs are predicted to exceed $5 billion in 2017 4.Cyber crime will more than triple the number of unfilled cybersecurity jobs, which is predicted to reach 3.5 million by 2021 Now, after realizing the size of opportunities and the huge amount of money this market is generating, its time to review 3 interesting projects that can make a great impact on both cyber security and blockchain industries. **[PolySwarm](URL Polyswarm present themselves as the first decentralize antivirus marketplace.By creating a new marketplace that will connect between cyber security experts(malware researchers in particular) and different AV(anti-virus) companies that are looking to outsource their efforts to find and detect new malwares. Their team is built by cybersecurity experts, which gives them a big advantage on the technical side. The other interesting move that PolySwarm came up with, is the fact that they will reward their community of cybersecurity experts with tokens for accurate malware identification. **[Cybervein](URL Cybervein offers a Universal network of decentralized databases. How does it work? This network will be the first distributed ledger system that can decentralize complex datasets and easily manage them on the blockchain itself, without actually having to deal with centralized storage providers. One of the biggest benefits behind their idea is that they allow multiple parties to process shared their disturbed databases. On a nutshell, they will provide a database that is immutable and protect from tampering (like bitcoin transactions on blockchain). Their leadership is built mainly by finance people so its interesting to see how high they can take this project to. **[Levelnet](URL Levelnet is looking to become the first decentralized antivirus platform. each user at Levelnet shares his virus detection data by secure protocol in a real time in order to provide a full coverage of real-time antivirus that is built on top of their decentralized protocol in order to protect against zero-day attacks. You probably ask yourself what is a zero day attack? Here is a quick input on that: A zero-day is an attack that exploits a previously unknown security vulnerability. Unlike using a regular anti virus software, where each software has its own detection method, Levelnet plans to provide an all-in-one place solution for protecting their end users from new and unrecognized threats.

10,cyber-crime,CryptoCurrency,Rivetz Analysis  Undervalued Token with Enormous Potential,16,74gl5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/74gl5t/rivetz_analysis_undervalued_token_with_enormous/,2017-10-06 02:12:54,"*Disclaimer  I hold Rivetz tokens. I love Factom because they are trying to solve a real-world problem and have a business mentality. I heard about Rivetz since they have a partnership with Factom. Rivetz has very similar characteristics to Factom such as government and large institutional support, business-like approach, and they are trying to solve a huge real-world problem. This is why I purchased Rivetz tokens.* **What is Rivetz?** The Problem: Cybersecurity has failed to keep pace with evolving threats caused by the increasing use of mobile devices, blockchains, smart contracts, IoT and cloud computing. During the next five years, cyber-crime might become the greatest threat to every person, place and thing in the world. Cybersecurity Ventures anticipates that cybersecurity damages will total more than $6 trillion globally, up from $3 trillion in 2015. Estimates peg the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices to exceed 200 billion by 2020. The Solution: Rivetz is building a Global Attestation and Identity Network, powered by the Rivetz Token (RvT), in order to improve the security of our mobile devices. The goal is to provide a platform and tools to simplify a developers access to the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), a dedicated and impenetrable hardware platform that exists in every device. With Rivetz, a known device has a special secret key hidden from hackers in the TEE that gives your device permission to sign into your services. Rivetz uses the RvT token and blockchain to cryptographically prove that the vault in your phone is secure, all the way from the manufacturer to your pocket essentially enabling every mobile wallet to have the same level of security as a hardware wallet like the Ledger. **Team and history** Rivetz has been building this technical foundations for 3 years. Rivetz is a first-mover with patent pending cybersecurity services and capabilities that leverage the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). Currently, there are no other competitors in this space. Steven is one of the principle industry evangelists for the application of trusted computing technology. Steven served as President and CEO for 14 years at Wave Systems, a security software company, so he has experience running a multi-million dollar company. The team has approx. 11 members. Notable advisors include a Board member from Factom and Gavin Wood, founder and former CTO of Ethereum, and founder of Parity Technologies. **Use of the tokens** The token is a utility ERC20 token and is used for:  Tokens are expected to be exchanged for Cybercontrol services. Rivetz builds a couple and we have partners building a couple; the APIs will be published for anyone to explore.  Tokens will be used to register reference health measurements.  Tokens will be used to verify the integrity of the device with the cybersecurity controller.  Tokens will be consumed to provide a machine multisig. Use case for Rivetz are IoT, Cloud Authentication and Access, Machine Automated Money with Policy, Cybersecurity Controls for Smart Contracts and Blockchain. **Strategic Partnerships** **Trustonic** Trustonic has already been deployed by manufacturers on 1 billion devices over the last 4 years, so there should be an installed base in the 500-700 Million units. Samsung, HTC, LG, Xiaomi, Miezu, ZTE, SONY, Kyocera, already deliver devices that will run the Rivetz trusted app. No hardware needs to be added! The TEE was added years ago by ARM, the company that does the architecture for all other chips in all phones. (Whitepaper) URL **TELEFONICA BUSINESS SOLUTIONS** Telefonica is a global company with 346 million customers in 45 countries with revenue of approx. 52 billion EURO URL **US Government Contracts** In Q1 2017 the company was awarded a US Government contract and in Q2 it was further awarded an SBIR contract by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) directorate. Whitepaper pg.6 **Factom Inc.** Rivetz, and Factom announced that Factom has selected Rivetz to integrate world cyber-security for the Factom applications URL **Parity** The companies' agreement signals a commitment to developing increased security standards within blockchain transactions, building a broader sense of confidence in blockchain networks and services. URL **National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence** Announced it has been selected by the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE), part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to collaborate on its Multifactor Authentication for e-Commerce project. URL Other smaller partnerships include LAToken, Touch Titans, Paypie, and myGEOTracking **Roadmap** Developer tools and the Rivetz 2 FA capability are expected to be delivered in the fall, and a machine multisig by the end of the year. **Value Proposition** The ICO was slated to sell 70 million tokens, however, I believe due to a combination of limited marketing and the complexity of the technology (I had to read the whitepaper 3 times to understand just the basic technology behind it), approximately only ~22 million tokens were sold. The ICO price was ~$0.85 and the current price is well below that due to the low volume. The CEO estimated that the circulating supply is under 30 million and with a price of $0.55 as of this writing, the market cap would be about **~16 million** so theres a ton of room for growth. The total market cap has yet to be updated in CMC as they are still going through the bounties. The token is currently only available on limited exchanges (ED and HitBTC) but the Company have mentioned in the Telegram channel that they are currently working with several major exchanges. To summarize, I think Rivetz is a great investment due to: 1. The Company has been working on this technology for 3 years 2. Is ran by a team that dedicated 14 years into running software security company 3. Massive real-world potential with currently no competition 4. Unknown at the moment and extremely undervalued in the crypto space 5. Has an impressive list of partnerships As always, do your own research and best of luck. "
11,cyber-crime,CryptoCurrency,Poloniex updated terms,2,6quidl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/6quidl/poloniex_updated_terms/,2017-08-01 16:43:14,"Poloniex has suddenly updated their terms. There are a lot of small changes in wording that don't seam to be of much relevance, which I have not put here. Here are the paragraphs containing the bigger changes. Under ""1. ELIGIBILITY"" some text has been rewritten and added. >You represent and warrant that you are not: (a) located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any country to which the United States has embargoed goods or services, (b) identified as a ""Specially Designated National, or (c) placed on the Commerce Department's Denied Persons List. You further represent and warrant that you will not use the Site if the laws of your country prohibit you from doing so in accordance with these Terms. > >Finally, you represent and warrant that you will not be using this site for any illegal activity, including but not limited to illegal gambling, money laundering, fraud, blackmail, extortion, ransoming data or the financing of terrorism, or other violent activities. > >Notwithstanding the foregoing, Poloniex may not make the Services, in whole or in part, available in every market, either in its sole discretion or due to legal or regulatory requirements, depending on the Users location. ""2. REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT"" became ""2. ACCOUNT AND INITIAL FUNDING; THIRD PARTY TRANSFERS"" and these paragraphs were added. >You must provide Poloniex with a valid email address to create an Account. You agree to keep your email address on file with us updated. You may withdraw your consent to receive emails by sending a withdrawal notice to Poloniex, understanding that Poloniex may suspend or terminate your ability to use the Services. You understand and agree that if Poloniex sends you an electronic communication but you do not receive it because your email address on file is incorrect or out of date, or because our email is blocked by your service provider or intercepted by your spam filter, or you are otherwise unable to receive electronic communications, Poloniex will be deemed to have provided the communication to you regardless. > >Poloniex does not allow Users to exchange Tokens for money; Users can only exchange Tokens for other Tokens. In order to fund your Account and begin trading, you will need to first procure Tokens. Once procured, you must send Tokens to the address provided by Poloniex and wait for the balance to appear in your Account. It is your responsibility to ensure you send Tokens to the correct address provided for that particular Token, else your funds may never be recovered. Poloniex makes no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time that may be required to complete transfer of your Tokens from a third party wallet or other source and have such Tokens become available in your Account. > >When you elect to transfer Tokens from your Account to a third party wallet or other location, it is always possible the party administering the new location may reject your transfer or that the transfer may fail due to technical or other issues affecting our platform. You agree that you shall not hold Poloniex liable for any damages arising from a rejected transfer. Poloniex reserves the right to limit the number of Accounts that any User or such Users affiliates can open or hold. Under ""4. CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION OVER THE INTERNET"" there are these new paragraphs. >Trading Tokens can be extremely risky. Each particular Token has a unique feature set that makes it more or less likely to fluctuate in value. In addition, factors beyond Poloniexs control may affect market liquidity for a particular Token, such as regulatory activity, market manipulation, or unexplainable price volatility. Blockchain networks may go offline as a result of bugs, hard forks, or a number of other unforeseeable reasons. Poloniex does not assume the risk of losses due to trading or due to factors beyond its control regarding the viability of specific blockchain networks. As a general matter, we advise Users with limited trading experience and low risk tolerance not to engage in active trading. Speculating on the value of Tokens is high risk and Users should never trade more than they can afford to lose. > >Understanding Tokens requires advanced technical knowledge. Tokens are often described in exceedingly technical language that requires a comprehensive understanding of applied cryptography and computer science in order to appreciate inherent risks. Listing of a Token on Poloniex does not indicate approval or disapproval of the underlying technology regarding any Token, and should not be used as a substitute for your own understanding of the risks specific to each Token. We give you no warranty as to the suitability of the Tokens traded under these Terms and assume no fiduciary duty in our relations with you. > >You accept the risk of trading Tokens. In entering into any transaction on the Platform, you represent that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your own independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of the transaction and the underlying Tokens. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice and experience to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction or any underlying Token. > >You are responsible for complying with applicable law. You agree that Poloniex is not responsible for determining whether or which laws may apply to your transactions, including tax law. You are solely responsible for reporting and paying any taxes arising from your use of the Services. > >You are aware of and accept the risk of operational challenges. Poloniex may experience sophisticated cyber attacks, unexpected surges in activity, or other operational or technical difficulties that may cause interruptions in the Service. You understand that the Service may experience operational issues that lead to delays on our platform. You agree to accept the risk of transaction failure resulting from unanticipated or heightened technical difficulties, including those resulting from sophisticated attacks. You agree not to hold Poloniex accountable for any related losses. (...) >Poloniex is a regulated entity and must comply with applicable law. Applicable law, regulation, and executive orders may require Poloniex to, upon request by government agencies, freeze withdrawals or trading (or both), or provide information regarding your account. Further, our recordkeeping and customer verification procedures are subject to change at any time as required by law or industry practices. We must comply with the law and you accept any inconveniences to you or other consequences resulting from our compliance. > >Users accept all consequences of sending Tokens to an address off our platform. Token transactions may not be reversible. Once you send Tokens to an address, you accept the risk that you may lose access to your Tokens indefinitely. For example, an address may have been entered incorrectly and the true owner of the address may never be discovered, or an address may belong to an entity that will not return your Tokens, or an address belongs to an entity that may return your Tokens but first requires action on your part, such as verification of your identity. Under ""6. MARGIN TRADING"" we now have this. >Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This can occur, for example, if there is insufficient liquidity in the market or due to technical issues on our platform. Placing contingent orders, such as ""stop-loss"" or ""stop-limit"" orders, will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders. The use of leverage can work against you as well as for you and can lead to large losses as well as gains. > >All Users understand that the technology underlying Tokens is subject to change at any time, and such changes may affect your assets stored on our platform. You claim full responsibility for monitoring such technological changes and understanding their consequences for your Tokens. Users conduct all trading, margin trading, lending, and/or borrowing on their own account and Poloniex does not take any responsibility for any loss or damage incurred as a result of your use of any Services or your failure to understand the risks involved in Token use generally or your use of our Services. ""7. LIMITED LICENSE"" became ""7. LIMITED LICENSE; FEES"" and has this new text. >In consideration for the use of the Services, you agree to pay to Poloniex the fees for completed trades, as set forth in our fee schedule, which Poloniex may revise or update in its sole discretion from time to time. You authorize Poloniex to deduct any applicable fees from your Account at the time you make a given transaction. Changes to the fee schedule are effective as of the date set forth in any revision and will apply prospectively from that date forward. > >Poloniex does not, as a general rule, participate in promotions without an official pronouncement, either on our Site or elsewhere. You promise to obtain prior written approval prior to releasing any statements, written media releases, public announcements and public disclosures, including promotional or marketing materials, relating to Poloniex. The biggest change appears to be in ""16. ELECTRONIC TRADING TERMS"". **This seams to be the relevant part for today's fork.** >Poloniex does not own or control any of the underlying software through which blockchain networks are formed and Tokens are created and transacted. In general, the underlying software for blockchain networks tends to be open source such that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute it. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree (i) that Poloniex is not responsible for operation of the underlying software and networks that support Tokens and that Poloniex makes no guarantee of functionality, security, or availability of such software and networks; and (ii) that the underlying protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (a/k/a Forks), and that such Forks may materially affect the value, function, and/or even the name of the Tokens you store in your Account. In the event of a Fork, you agree that Poloniex may temporarily suspend the Services (with or without advance notice to you) and that Poloniex may, in its sole discretion, (a) configure or reconfigure its systems or (b) decide not to support (or cease supporting) the Forked network entirely, provided, however, that you will have an opportunity to withdraw Tokens on at least one of still existant underlying networks. You acknowledge and agree that Poloniex assumes absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect of any underlying software protocols, whether Forked or not. > >Poloniex may delist a Token at any time in its sole discretion based on a number of factors, one of which may include changes in a given Tokens characteristics after Poloniex has listed the Token. > >A transaction on the Platform may fail for several reasons, including but not limited to change in seller prices, insufficient margin, or unanticipated technical difficulties. We make no representation or warrant that any transaction will be executed properly. Poloniex is under no circumstances liable for any loss or injury suffered by a failure of a transaction to complete properly or in a timely manner. Further, Poloniex is in no way responsible for notifying you of a transaction failure. The User has full responsibility to determine and inquire into the failure of any transaction the User initiates. > >In the event that you receive any data, information, or software through our Services other than that which you are entitled to receive pursuant to these Terms, you will immediately notify us and will not use, in any way whatsoever, such data, information, or software. If you request a withdrawal of Tokens and we cannot comply with it without closing some part of your open positions, we will not comply with the request until you have closed sufficient positions to allow you to make the withdrawal. > >Poloniex may refuse to execute a trade, impose trade amount limits or restrictions at any time in its sole discretion without notice. Specifically, Poloniex reserves the right to refuse to process, or the right to cancel or reverse, any transaction or disable a Users deposit address on the Platform where Poloniex suspects the transaction involves money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other type of crime or if Poloniex suspects the transaction relates to a prohibited use as stated in our Terms, including transactions involving the opening of an Account and subsequent closure without any actual trading occurring. Poloniex provides deposit Accounts to enable trading using the Services and does not allow Users to use such Accounts as a web wallet or address changing service. We reserve the right to halt deposit activity at our sole discretion. While Poloniex may in its discretion reverse a trade, a User may not change, withdraw, or cancel its authorization to make a transaction, except with respect to partially filled orders. > >Poloniex may correct, reverse, or cancel any trade impacted by an error in processing your purchase or otherwise. Your remedy in the event of an error will be limited. You may seek to cancel your order or obtain a refund of any amounts charged to you, although we cannot guarantee such cancellations or refunds will always be possible. > >Poloniex provides its Users with a platform that allows their orders to be matched with the orders of other Users. Orders may be partially filled or may be filled by a number of orders, depending on the trading activity at the time an order is placed. > >The Tokens that are available for purchase through the Services may be subject to high or low transaction volume, liquidity, and volatility at any time for potentially extended periods. You acknowledge that while we are using commercially reasonable methods to provide exchange rate information to you through our Services, the exchange rate information we provide may differ from prevailing exchange rates made available by third parties. Similarly, the actual market rate at the time of your trade may be different from the indicated prevailing rate depending on the velocity of trading in the Tokens involved in your trade. You agree that Poloniex is not liable for price fluctuations or differences in actual versus indicated rates. And finally, under ""23. ARBITRATION"" they added. **This is the part that may cause concern to those who are afraid Poloniex is insolvent.** >PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY  IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. > >To expedite and control the cost of disputes, you and we agree that any legal or equitable claim arising out of or relating to your use of the Services or these Terms, including the formation, validity, enforceability, scope, or applicability of these Terms, including this Section 23 (referred to as a Claim) will be resolved as follows (...) >ADDITIONALLY, YOU HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial. If a court or federal regulator with oversight over Poloniex decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this sections limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court, subject to your and Poloniex's right to appeal the court's decision. All other claims will be arbitrated. You can read the current terms [here](URL and the old terms [in the web archive](URL **TL;DR:** URL"
