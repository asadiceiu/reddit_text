For that i got 1500 points. By redeeming those i could get a voucher of Rs.500. I get 1 year to claim and use it. In March i decide to use it but cancelled as there were no good offers. In June when i tried to redeem it, to my surprise, the points had already been used ! I tried to recollect where did i use it, but to no avail. I decided to still claim the voucher as it still displayed the number during checkout. It showed the voucher has been claimed by Some email id. **The Mail id was hidden**. as in some letters were covered with ""\*"". I called myntra to find out. They did a 'tareek pe tareek' with me. 15-20 days pass by, 3 calls later, i tweeted and got an immediate response from higher up, who told me ""**sir we cant provide you someone else's email id"".** Im like dude wtf ? the man used my account to redeem points into his account and you cant give me his email id ? They said its private and cannot be shared. I was baffled at what i was hearing. Someone logs into my account, uses my points to get a gift card into their account, and this lady is telling me she cant give me the name who used it ? are you fucking kidding me ? Another thing that blew my mind was, i dont think someone logged into my account. IIRC a new device has logged in mail pops up if we try to login. No one has my password, not even me ( Im srs), i forgot it long ago and used otp to login. I never used it on any other device other than my phone and PC. My pc is very secure and so is my phone. They dont have any two factor authentication. They are asking me to file a cyber crime complaint first. I'll have to ask my uncle who is in crimes dept first. As i wanna know how much of a hassle is cyber crime dept. And its not a case of 500 ka coupon, its about someone easily breaching an account and without any notification able to use points. I highly suspect someone from their own team could be responsible as they have all the data, im not sure. But now i have decided to boycott myntra completely."

However google cloud says there is a possibility for debt collectors to come to me in future if I don't pay. I think I am not responsible since charges happened through fraudulent access and google even had suspicion over it. Should I leave the matter and wait for debt collectors to come? Has anyone ever had a experience with debt collectors in india, please advise me how can I defend myself here from paying something I didn't do."

3,cyber-crime,india,Banning 59 Apps sets a concerning precedent. A detailed statement and initial action.,1,hj8pn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/hj8pn3/banning_59_apps_sets_a_concerning_precedent_a/,2020-07-01 21:50:04,"&amp;#x200B; URL ### TL;DR Two days ago, the Government of India banned 59 mobile apps. The reasons for this include national security and protection of user privacy and security. This sets a concerning precedent and may be a singular action of web censorship that has impacted more people India than ever before. In this post, we, through our statement, indicate areas of concerns around the legality of the process and also indicate how, by filing Right to Information requests, we are hoping for greater public disclosure. ### A concerning act of web censorship On June 29, through [**a press release**](URL the Government of India acting through the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY) banned 59 smartphone applications. To provide clarity from the perspective of digital rights of users we published an initial statement linked below. URL We are substantiating this initial statement with a detailed analysis which indicates several concerns on the legality of the blocking process. To achieve further clarity and transparency we have also yesterday morning filed several right to information requests. The detailed statement follows below: &gt;As firm believers in the Constitution of India our mission is to ensures that technology should further the goals set out in the preamble. These goals cannot be achieved if the integrity and the security of India is compromised. To safeguard them our republic prescribes clear means and measures that are premised on a democratic framework. The hallmark of this are our fundamental rights. &gt; &gt;In one of the most significant cases concerning the interaction of these fundamental rights with digital technologies, hearing a challenge against Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 the Supreme Court also had occasion to examine the power of the Government to issue directions to block web services. This power contained under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 contains the power to issue directions for blocking along with its grounds in it's first sub-section. The second-subsection to Section 69A contains a requirement to establish a process and safeguards under which the IT Blocking Rules, 2009 have been made. &gt; &gt;This power has been purportedly been exercised by the Ministry of Electronics and IT on June 29, 2020 which has been publicly disclosed through a press release through the Press Information Bureau (PIB). This press release, indicates distinct grounds under which 59 smartphone applications have been blocked that are contained under in an Annexure. The release contains references to threats to the security, integrity of India and public order of an ""emergent nature"" for which the direction to block these web services are ""emergency measures"". The further basis of this direction to block is premised on purported complaints including a recommendation from the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Committee, Ministry of Home Affairs and complaints received by CERT-In. Further references are made to debates and comments made in Parliament. &gt; &gt;While acknowledging the real harm which occurs to the privacy and security of users due to the unregulated expropriation of their personal data we are also concerned with a restriction of their right to receive information and use such services. As per our reading of Section 69A it does not extend to directions for blocking smartphone applications but individual pieces of information and content. We are particularly concerned with the legal process which has been initiated for these directions given they do not contain any available technical analysis against any specific application prior to the media release on the direction for blocking. This sets a worrying precedent and tremendous expansion of the power to block web services in India. &gt; &gt;There seems to be any pre-decisional hearing which has been afforded to any of these 59 web-services and given they have been accessible for a long period of time a regular process in which they were afforded a hearing would be naturally expected. Such ""emergent circumstances"" even when they did emerge do not specifically indicate any technical assessments conducted by CERT-In and do not also clearly indicate whether they are linked to recent border tensions caused due to China given there is a natural inference that many of these web services are of Chinese origin or control. &gt; &gt;The press release is a drastic step and expansion in the practice of website blocking. It presents risk of setting a precedent that will undermine the digital rights of Indian internet users. Such directions are in deviation from the rule of law framework under the provisions of the Information Technology Act and the judgement of the Supreme Court as adverted above. In view of the above we call on the Government of India to publish the legal order (not a media release) and make proper disclosures. We further urge that specific regulatory instruments such as the Data Protection Bill to safeguard individual privacy must be advanced. Further if action is needed due to security reasons in examining foreign control made in core sectors such as technology and telecoms then appropriate policy conversations may be initiated. Here non-compliance can be penalised in an objective and evidence based manner with a clear legal standard that may include fines and directions to abstain from illegal conduct. &gt; &gt;We caution against the expansion of the power to block web-services. This bad for users, innovation, the larger technology ecosystem of India. We urge the Government to reconsider this dangerous step which sets a worrying precedent for digital rights. In view of this statement and to seek further transparency we have initiated steps commencing with the filing of Right to Information Requests with several government departments. **Right to Information requests filed by IFF** Yesterday morning, we filed Right to Information requests with multiple authorities in the hopes of bringing transparency and accountability to the process through which this ban is being implemented. Requests have been filed with the Ministry of Electronic &amp; Information Technology (MeitY) through its Department of Electronics &amp; Information Technology (DeitY) and Department of Telecommunication (DoT). We have also filed a separate request with the DeitY for obtaining information from the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) which operates under the department. Lastly we have filed a request with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to obtain information about their involvement in the ban. Below we have provided insight into each of these requests. **A. Right to Information requests with MeitY** **i. With DeitY and DoT on the ban** In our requests dated June 30, 2020 with Ref. No.s DITEC/R/E/20/00519 (DeitY) and DOTEL/R/E/20/00577 (DoT), we asked these two authorities to provide us with copies of the actual order issued by MeitY banning these applications, since currently we only have a press release and not the actual order. Obtaining the order is crucial since it contains the reasons for the ban which are important when we try to assess the legality and validity of the ban. We also asked them whether the process which is stated under S.69A of the IT Act and the Blocking Rules, 2009 for blocking of websites was followed in the implementation of this ban. This process includes giving notice, having a hearing and providing a reasoned order for blocking. &amp;#x200B; [RTI Ref. No. DITEC\/R\/E\/20\/00519 filed with DeitY dated 30.6.2020](URL In the press release, it is stated that the blocking was being done because MeitY had ""received many complaints various sources including several reports about misuse of some mobile apps available on Android and iOS platforms for stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users data in an unauthorized manner to servers which have locations outside India."" In our request, we asked them to provide us copies of these complaints. Additionally, we asked them whether they had carried out any objective assessments on the privacy impact of these applications and to provide us with a copy of the reports of these assessments if they had been carried out. &amp;#x200B; [RTI Ref. No. DOTEL\/R\/E\/20\/00577 filed with DoT dated 30.6.2020](URL **ii. With DeitY for obtaining information from CERT-IN** In our request dated June 30, 2020 with Ref. No. DITEC/R/E/20/00521, we asked DeitY to provide us with information about the role played by CERT-IN in the implementation of the ban. According to the press release, CERT-IN ""has also received many representations from citizens regarding security of data and breach of privacy impacting upon public order issues"". Thus, we asked them to provide us with a copy of all the representations that they have received which flag such concerns about the blocked applications. Additionally, we asked them to provide us with the minutes of the any meetings that they held wherein this issue was discussed as a measure of increasing transparency and accountability. Finally, we asked them whether CERT-IN had carried out any objective assessments on the privacy impact of these applications and to provide us with a copy of the reports of these assessments if they had been carried out. [RTI Ref. No. DITEC\/R\/E\/20\/00521 filed with DeitY dated 30.6.2020](URL **B. Right to Information Requests with MHA** In our request dated June 30, 2020 with Ref. No. MHOME/R/E/20/03251, we asked MHA to provide us with a copy of all the representations that they had received which were ""raising concerns from citizens regarding security of data and risk to privacy relating to operation of certain apps"" as stated in the press release. It was also stated in the press release that the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C), which operates under the MHA, had ""sent an exhaustive recommendation for blocking these malicious apps"". We asked them to provide us with a copy of this recommendation as it would help us in assessing the reasons behind the ban. We also asked them to provide us with the minutes of the any meetings that I4C held wherein this issue was discussed. Additionally, we asked them whether I4C had carried out any objective assessments on the privacy impact of these applications and to provide us with a copy of the reports of these assessments if they had been carried out. Finally, we asked them to provide us with a copy of all the correspondence which took place between the MHA and MeitY with regard to the ban. &amp;#x200B; [RTI Ref.

We believe it is someone from the family, so we sent the hacked relatives to the police but they have refused to file FIR. They want some bribe so they can just let us know who these people are but they wont file an FIR. Since we stay in UAE , our only option is now is to go to any private cyber crime investigator who can find out who these people really are. So would really appreciate if someone can guide me to reputed cyber crime investigators. I am ready to pay all reasonable charges for their service.

I then reported it to cyber crime website and they called me after few days and asked me to visit them in my district's cyber cell which is 20 Km away from me in a whole different place and by that time LockDown 1.0 started.

Within minutes, my dad got a message from HDFC stating that a transaction of Rs. 20,000 was made via mobikwik . But, here's the banger. He never tried mobikwik before.

By this point of the time, I knew that something is fishy but I played along. Then he said that he is the town to collect money from someone but that person doesn't have much cash and asking to transfer via Gpay or Paytm, so that person will send money to me and my self claimed relative will collect that form me. Then I got a Gpay payment request and that person tried hard to convince me that if I click on Pay then money will be transferred to my account. My point is if it was someone else at my place who doesn't understand these apps well, he/she could have been easily duped. And it seems like police are not doing enough to tackle these kinds of crimes. Our government is promoting cashless economy, but not doing anything for awareness regarding such scams."

This guy told that he will buy them and would send an advance right away. He pretended to be an army officer and told that he is not permitted to receive or send money directly and it has to go through the government. That there's a machine in between and when you scan the QR code money will be debited from his account and also get credited right after. In order to gain his trust, he first did a 50 transaction. My friend believed him, sent him around 40k. This guy called him again and told that the machine was only connected from one side. He has complained and he will receive the money in a short while. Meanwhile let's do it on Paytm. He cleared whatever he had on Paytm. Interesting part: my friend has a limit of 25k on his account and still lost 40k. Local police station, bank and cyber crime straight away denied. Now the thing is, this guy is still active. He texts on whatsapp, receives(rarely) and sends calls. Is asking for more 15k if he wants to receive everything back. TLDR; Friend lost 45k (though his limit is 25k) on PhonePe by scanning QR codes sent by someone on OLX who pretended to be an army officer. The OLX buyer is still active, sends and receives calls and whatsapp texts. If anyone could be of any help. Getting the money back or lending some money. Ps. Always remember, scanning QR codes is only for sending money and never receiving it."
11,cyber-crime,india,Why the Telangana Encounter is not what you guys think it is.,1,e78tjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e78tjo/why_the_telangana_encounter_is_not_what_you_guys/,2019-12-07 13:55:50,"The entire thing is very simple if you understand who KCR is. I've been an avid political Analyst closley analysing His moves from the entire Telangana Agitation to the current RTC strike and one thing I can say is that KCR is obsessed with the ""Image"" of Telangana. During his terms he funneled a lot of funds to the Security and Police services within the state to improve efficiency and performance, New cars, New Commissionerates, New Interceptor divisions, Police sensitivity programs , Cyber teams and Apps, She teams for women safety and Women cabs and Buses. Hyd was found to be one of the more safer cities for women adn had the fastest response time in emergencies. A simple google search would prove this. The Cyber security council had lauded the Cyberabad police's attempts to broaden its spectrum in identifying crime and using newer tech to analyse crime scenes in the last two Conventions. In the recent RTC strike issue, he had destroyed the BJP ploy to undermine him and in a stroke of his unusual charm made all the RTC employees support him and take his side to return to duty while the unions and other political parties where seen as villians responsible for the entire fiasco. He loves being loved and makes any political incident to his benefit. So, when the Disha incident happened, the BJP jumped onto the oppurtunity to make this issue such that ""HYD is an unsafe city under KCR"" But this spiralled out of control one spread due to the sheer gruesomeness of the crime. And when one of the Accused turned out to be a muslim, twitter and other media just exploded. Almost every ""national"" news channel seemed to bash Telangana and Hyd police for the ""Failure of Law"" when they had done considerably better than most in the last 5 years. Channels who never mentioned KCRs contributions to the state throughout the years suddenly started burying him in blame about the incident. He. Was. Pissed. This is evident from a meet he did with a relative in Delhi. Hounded by media personal on his ""ApaThy"" He trusts his police, so making this a CM level issue is involuntarily stating his beloved police has failed. To add fuel to the already huge flames, The Former BJP head of Tamil Nadu and current governor of Telangana met up with the victim's family at the victim's home. BJP was messing with his core audience now. So being the shrewd politician he is. He just removed the Fuel. By Authorising the Encounter, KCR won the battle in a single swoop. BJP has no ammo, Public is in all praise for his police and No one even cared about him. All as planned. So those thinking that this is going to be a norm, please do not worry, this was a political ploy to ensure BJP doesn't fuck up one of the youngest states of the country and Hyd has one of the highest number of cases closed. It is not going to be a Jungle raj. Just Rajneethi. If Amit Shah is Chanakya, KCR is his Baap."

When I approached one of the well known advocate of my city he advised me not go the judiciary way. In India, (Civil) decisions are so prolonged that it is really of no use. As it is said that justice delayed is justice denied. There are numerous cases where someone has illegally occupied somebody else's property and the case it going on for years. So imagine the cost of property is 1 million and to get the occupancy you need to invest 25 thousand it's a good deal. Now you can invest 50 thousand every year to prolong the case. It is quite cheaper than actually renting the property. Secondly the owner has to also bear the same coat just to fight back or else in most of the cases people prefer not to fight and give away such property."
15,cyber-crime,india,Why is porn being blocked in India? #WhatTheBlock,317,chkidq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/chkidq/why_is_porn_being_blocked_in_india_whattheblock/,2019-07-25 17:28:56,"Highlights * **Background:** In response to IFFs RTI query, MeitY has revealed that blocking of pornographic websites in India is the result of three court orders. Two of these court orders were passed by an Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate in Mumbai and the third order was passed by the Uttarakhand High Court. * **No pro-active blocking of porn by ISPs:** We can reasonably infer from MeitYs response that ISPs have not been directed by the government to proactively block porn websites, and they should not be doing so in the absence of a specific court order. Hence, legally there is little or no basis for proactive blocking. ### ### The mystery behind the Porn Ban In India, viewing sexually explicit material in private spaces is not illegal. Then why are porn websites being blocked? Many of our supporters have pinged us about this issue, so we got down to first diagnosing why this is happening before coming up with solutions, if any, that this may require. First, lets start with the basics. In India, there are three ways to block a website. First, a website may be blocked pursuant to a court order. Second, a website can be blocked pursuant to directions of the Central Government under Section 69A of the IT Act. This is usually done by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and the Department of Telecommunication (DoT). However, the Central Government cannot directly block websites for merely hosting pornographic content because obscenity or morality is not a ground for blocking websites under Section 69A of the IT Act (remember the controversy surrounding blocking of Savita Bhabi? Read more about it [here](URL Finally, the DoT can also issue specific directions to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) under the [Unified Access License](URL to block websites in public interest (Clause 7.12) or to prevent transmission of obscene content (Clause 38.1). To get to the bottom of this issue, we filed RTIs with both MeitY and DoT. Our RTI filed with DoT was transferred to MeitY, and the response from MeitY revealed that porn websites have been blocked in India pursuant to three court orders passed from 2016 to 2018. ### ### Non-availability of court orders Unfortunately, out of the three court orders cited by MeitY, only one order is publicly accessible and we have filed a first appeal with MeitY for a copy of the other two orders. Two of the three court orders were passed by the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate of the Esplanade Court in Mumbai in 2016 and 2017. While we could not access copies of these two orders, the information available on the E-Courts website suggests that 500 websites were blocked in a single day based on a complaint by the cyber police department without providing any hearing to the owners of these websites. &amp;#x200B; [\(Screenshot from the E-Court website showing that the order passed by the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate from Mumbai has not been uploaded by the court.\)](URL &amp;#x200B; The third court order which is publicly accessible was passed by the Uttarakhand High Court in a suo moto writ petition (WP PIL No. 158/2018). In this case, the Uttarakhand High Court had directed blocking of pornographic websites mentioned in a notification by DoT dated 31.07.2015. However, DoT has clarified that out of the 857 websites mentioned in the notification, ISPs were only required to block those websites which hosted child pornography. Further, the final order dated 07.12.2018 in this writ petition disposed the matter after referring to an existing case in the Supreme Court, Kamlesh Vaswani v. Union of India (WP Civil No. 177/2013). Interestingly, the RTI reply side-steps two other cases, Kamlesh Vaswani v. Union of India and In Re: Prajwala (SMW Crl No. 3/2015) which may have led to blocking of websites that feature child porn or videos of sexual violence. However, to the best of our knowledge, these cases have not led to any directions for blocking of pornography websites more generally. ### ### ISPs should not block porn pro-actively ISPs expands to internet service providers, *not internet service police.* The legal position is clear and they should desist from proactive filtering and blocking practices. Moreover, the information received by us gives rise to a reasonable inference that the Government is **not** issuing directions to block porn unless it is child pornography. To us, this means that there are no existing directions for pro-active blocking of obscene content by ISPs, and they should not be doing so without a specific court orders directing them to block individual URLs. Finally, we recognize the concerning psychological impact of porn production and consumption but we do believe that when viewed privately, it falls within an individuals right to free speech and privacy. This certainly does not include pornography which has minors present in it, or is created in the absence of consent. To make and view pornography belonging to both these classes is not only a crime, but a deep moral stain that results in long lasting physical and mental harm to the participants who are exploited for its production. We acknowledge that the ethics of mainstream porn production, particularly the portrayal of women and other minorities, merit study and examination. There have been notable attempts by [Point of View](URL [Centre for Internet and Society](URL and [Centre for Communication Governance](URL to promote a better understanding of online pornography through conferences and reports, and we hope there is greater conversation on the issue. At present, we maintain that pornography production requires greater diversity and strict enforcement to ensure absence of trafficking and labour protection. These are issues beyond the scope of our expertise and we look for leadership from feminist and sex workers rights organisations who are best suited to take the lead on this issue. We will listen and learn. At the same time, IFF will do what it does best, which is fight for internet freedom and the choice of individual internet users in India. This includes the private consumption of content that is deemed obscene under antiquated, colonial laws which should not find space in modern, progressive India. ### ### Important Documents: 1.

We need many more NGT benches. Do we have enough competent lawyers to occupy those benches? With the National Clean Energy FUnd now be used to compensate States for the losses due to GST, what is the Govt's plan to fund its environment and climate actions now? Why has the government backed away from the EV policy? Why regulations around sale and use of pet coke have been relaxed? What is the status of the Waste Segregation and City Compost Policy under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which were supposed to be taken up in 2017? Sustainable solutions for agriculture, waste management, pollution ++ do not cost much. Why cant the bureaucracy look at such solutions? Why not learn from China, how it brought down pollution in Beijing during the last few years? Farmers and Agrarian distress Quote Indian farmers have, for long, ensured that the country does not face any food shortage. The time has finally come for the PM to declare: I am confident Indian farmers can feed the nation, I annul the Essential Commodities Act. The most critical reform to revolutionise Indian agriculture requires no money. It requires something far harder to acquire  learning to unlearn yesterdays wisdom. Unquote You were ride on seaplane during Gujarat election, didn't left enough water for irrigation in narmada dam. Why ? Today coastal saurashtra is in submerged condition, forget about sea plane there isn't enough life savings boat , how can u afford seaplane ?

What is the status of the new crop insurance scheme? How much premiums were paid and what is the payout to farmers? How many marginal farmers who were not earlier given loans by institutional finance been brought into institutional finance instead of loan sharks Finance Who IS the FM? Why the hell is Aadhaar, which was initially implemented for granting govt benefits directly to the people being used as an identity card now and being forced to link with banks and mobile numbers (Even when proved that it is not unique nor safely guarded) ? What was the actual purpose of demonetisation ? Did it yield any results? How much effective was it in combating counterfeit currency and curbing terrorism? Why does RBI takes so much time to count all the notes? Why petrol not included in the GST? Why Alcohol not included in the GST? How this government understand the final effect/result of any project they rollout.(e.g Jan Dhan/ Ganga /Demonetization / etc) Do they really care about ground reality, if yes then please tell the procedure. Do they have any deadline to get the feedback / Complete the process. Education Why was autonomous status forced down on Universities? Do you have a good word or not on the changes brought about in Delhi schools by a different govt? The commitment to IoE has come down from 20000cr to just 3000cr. Why? Why is there an urgency to bring in the No Detention policy, without setting up a proper lower education infrastructure where the teachers are asked not only to teach but sent on census duty and election duty etc ? Why is only 3% of the budget being concentrated on the education? Why haven't you shared the cess collected in the development of the schools? Research fellows from IIT will be paid Rs. 70000 as stipend. Why not extend this fellows from other institutions too? For instance, JRFs are given Rs. 25k, SRFs Rs. 28k and RAs Rs. 35k-40k How difficult is it to disburse Central government fellowships to research students on time? Even with the DBT scheme in place, why are research students not receiving fellowship money for 10 months? What about Jio University? Which factors indicated it to be ranked as an eminent institute? Jobs If the Hon PM is so concerned about the lack of data on jobs, then why was the annual labour survey of employment -unemployment discontinued on his watch after 2016? Experts in the field of solid waste management know that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan can become the biggest employer, and solve several issues. But state govts and municipalities continue their nexus with contractors who charge astronomical sums for waste-handling equipment and for transportation of waste. Why is a well-intended mission being defeated by the (lower) bureaucracy? Civic action groups must be involved. New pension scheme: Is it a good idea to link pensions to the stock market? Elections and funding for parties How are the retrospective amendments to FCRA wrt political contributions tenable? What is the sense behind having a non-transparent electoral bond mechanism for donating to Political parties? Why did you allow the secrecy in election bond ? And by keeping it known to bank govt have direct control on data. Accountability and Transparency See for example the ""National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business"". URL Question: Do the #NVGs (National Voluntary Guidelines) apply to banks? And the Government itself? Our govts are unable to ensure compliance to mandatory laws. How will the #NVGs work out? The PM speaks of combating corruption, Then why the electoral bonds and Removing provisions of RTI, which kills the transparency all the more? Why no appointment according to the Lokpal act? Can modiji explain why the RTI is being weakened? Where is the data on demonetization and its effects (both positive and negative)? Why did gov legalise foreign funding of political parties? That too retrospectively ? Why isnt any serious action taken on Panama Papers, where a country like pakistan can send their ex pm to jail for it? Q) Does Modi and people in his party think all people are idiots? Serious Question since they keep on barking on without facts or figures and just talks as the teenage me fighting against my parents talking random shit that doesnt matter in the context. --There are still a lot of people who still support modi even after seeing the evidences. They are mostly carried by the Hindutva narrative.( And these are educated people working in very big MNCs, living in metro cities) Modi should answer the priority his government has given to basic education in government schools, employment opportunities and healthcare facilities? Can the government please explain why the states have not been given a part of the 2.35 lac crores collected in the form of cess in 2016-17? Environment is suffering , what is the take of Modi government to tackle pollution and save natural resources(water, forests)? Why no action on combating fake news ? And why target WhatsApp ( WhatsApp works differently than other SNS. It is end-to-end encrypted, WhatsApp cant read what is being shared on its platform)? Why is there perpetual violence/unrest happening in JNU and the likes of it? The high handed approach in Kashmir is clearly a failure. Either defend the strategy or come up with future plan to integrate the youth on Kashmir into India. Secular fabric of country is devastated under Modi government, what's their take on it? Foreign policy of india is suffering, how extravagance expanse of modi's foreign visits can be justified? Women Reservation bill?, Lokpal Bill?. Revised GDP figures with new formula?. Which of the countries PM Modi hasnt visited? (Expecting from Modi Law and Order Silence on the damage to social fabric (includes Mob Lynching). What are the measures taken by the govt for overall protection of women in the society in the wake of recent spike in rapes? Why arent police being recruited in full force? There are vacancies in large numbers in almost every state? Does the govt care about the people being lynched willy nilly by people taking law into their own hands or do they think it's not the govt responsibility to ensure the safety and security of its citizens? Why hasnt the Central government passed the Womens reservation bill in Lok Sabha which is due from 2008 after being passed in Rajya Sabha? Who handles PMs social media accounts? If it's done by PMO, what steps have been taken to avoid encouraging anti social elements on SM, especially given the fact that PMs twitter account follows people found giving online rape threats and abuses to women/journalists/ministers. Why did the bjp take a 4 long years to decide n use the nirbhaya funds on women safety issues? Doesn't this blatantly show how much the gov is serious n care for women safety?? Especially girls r subjected to violence every second in the co (Nirbhaya funds were alloted after the gruesome delhi rape case.) Whats the current status on the Uniform Civil Code? Federal Democracy 1. It is obvious that a number of states with different parties in power are doing some things right, going by the positive outcomes. Federal Democracy is here to stay. But the needs of citizens within different states are quite different. Respect regional aspirations. One size cannot fit all, ever, in India, or elsewhere. 2. Why is the gov increasingly taking democratic institutions for granted? Ex: using governor states to boss around in the administrative matter of state government. Ex: tamilnadu, new delhi, puducherry, karnataka. Health Care Why does the government not take inspiration from NHS scheme in the UK (which provides efficient and great healthcare to UK residents)? Why does the gov not allocating enough budget for health care despite india ranking low in HDI even with our neighbours countries ? Other Is it unparliamentary to hug someone in parliament as suggested by Bhupendra Chaubey? Why are ministers with unscientific viewpoint still given cabinet portfolios? Why does government not invest in Cyber Security like other major countries like China, Russia and USA? Our government websites and databases are not fully secured (as evident from data being accessed by fs0ciety from AP govt. website) We have great Security Engineers, but they are all employed in Private Sector. Why was AAP asked to repay the amount they spent from government treasury on advertisement, but BJP keeps plastering Modis photo everyday in the newspapers and online advertisement (nearly Rs 4600 crores) without any repercussions?

I've been hearing about data leaks for months now but having this happen to me is just so unbelievable. Also, I've asked students there what they're doing about it and why they're not doing anything after the University just went ""oh well, it's down now. chill"" and apparently they can't and don't want to because they're not allowed to and because the university can ban them/withhold them from passing out. And they're just listening! Like I understand it's their degree or education but I just can't see why they can't see that the university cannot ban or detain all the students. Why everyone can't protest against it all together? How are they not as angry about it to go knocking on the authorities doors and not attending any classes from tomorrow itself until the university makes sure that all the data given to them is going to kept safe.

Long story short, he was a scammer/fraudster who uses this same method to scam unsuspecting people like me. He scammed me for an amount of Rs 2500/-. Now I know the amount may not seem like a lot to you, but being a student currently studying, this was my months allowance. Anyways, I am not writing this post to seek help in getting back my money, but I'm shocked to see the useless police system in India. I tried to file an FIR on the 11th of October the very next morning. But the police officers were least bothered in hearing my case. They were rude even when I was talking to them in a polite tone and they also made me wait 2 hours in the police station just to tell me that this case would have to be registered in some other police station. When I went to the next police station the police officer in charge of filling the FIR, declined to file an FIR saying that this was my own fault and there was nothing the police could do. Like really? If I'm not supposed to go to the police for help, who am I supposed to approach to for help? The same day I also tried calling the cyber crime cell in Noida.

His number is always busy, I'm sure he's trying to scam more people and this is what makes me sad, knowing that this person is still scammimg more and more people as time passes and there is not I can do about it. 2) Why were the police refusing to file an FIR? 3) If the cyber crime cell already knows their location why is it not taking any action against them? Like getting them locked up or making the scammers pay for their doings. 4) There is no direct way of filling an cyber crime complain in India. The cyber crime cells website asks you to either visit the office manually or file an online complaint. The online complaint never gets completed as there is always some problem in filling a complain online. 5) This is the 21st century and the police is saying that they cannot trace and catch a guy who has his phone number always running and whose location they already know. I would like to ask my fellow Indians to help needed out in this situation by suggesting what I can do. PS: I do not want my money back, I just want other people to be safe from such scammers and the police not to be such ignorant and rude if a person is trying to seek their help.

Long story short, he was a scammer/fraudster who uses this same method to scam unsuspecting people like me. He scammed me for an amount of Rs 2500/-. Now I know the amount may not seem like a lot to you, but being a student currently studying, this was my months allowance. Anyways, I am not writing this post to seek help in getting back my money, but I'm shocked to see the useless police system in India. I tried to file an FIR on the 11th of October the very next morning. But the police officers were least bothered in hearing my case. They were rude even when I was talking to them in a polite tone and they also made me wait 2 hours in the police station just to tell me that this case would have to be registered in some other police station. When I went to the next police station the police officer in charge of filling the FIR, declined to file an FIR saying that this was my own fault and there was nothing the police could do. Like really? If I'm not supposed to go to the police for help, who am I supposed to approach to for help? The same day I also tried calling the cyber crime cell in Noida. They told me to go to the police station and file an FIR. Now when I told them that the police officers were not filling an FIR, they asked me to come to there office in Noida.

Here's the copy of detailed complaint I filed online on behalf of my uncle - A few weeks back, I received a phone call which was claimed to be from RBI by the caller(8512013934 - Kunal Mehta) and asked me If I was satisfied with my insurance policy. Where I lodged a complaint that I'm not receiving any documents related to deposits against my policy and I would like to quit. Later day, I got a call where the caller claimed to be from my insurance company and had details about my policy and asked me why I have raised the complaint, I gave him details about my problems with the policy. I asked him to quit the policy and asked the process for refunds where he said that only half of the amount will be returned and then He started arguing with me on the phone which seems to be a part of their plot. Then I made a call to Kunal Mehta who claimed to be from the RBI. I told him about what happened with the call regarding my registered complaint. He asked me to share the number and placed a call to the person who claimed to be from my insurance company and scolded him in front of me to make an impression that he's actually from RBI and really want me to help with my situation. Later Kunal Mehta asked me to make a deposit in order to terminate my policy and so that they can release the submitted amount during the policy tenure. I have a few recordings of the phone conversation available with me. I did make a deposit of 14,000 RS and then 74,000 in order to pre-mature my policy and retire the sum of the amount as soon as possible. All these deposits were told to me like the standard procedure of the policy. I haven't received any amount and this person called me again to make a deposit of 50000 as he said it's a tax which needs to be paid to process the policy amount. Summary: I am receiving a phone call which is claimed to be from RBI by the caller and have taken 14000, 74000 RS through Bank Cheque(s) from me. I am reporting this case of fraud and seeking police help under the provision of IT and cyber crime. For more information on the case please reach me at +91-XXXXX OR XXXXX.

Companies need to pay heed to their security, use best practicies, and also have healthy programs where they can treat reports from security researchers with priority and work with them.

While there were enough stories that you would have read about how it spread and how it was stopped by researchers through the kill-switch domains etc, I was perturbed by another concern. Our government agencies don't seem to have any handle on response to cyber threats. Govt officials are in denial mode by saying [there was no impact to India](URL or [there is no instance reported](URL On the other hand, we saw several reports of govt [departments](URL [getting](URL [hit](URL India was purported to be anywhere between 3rd to 5th largest hit in many independent assesments.

Or take the red pill and we'll show you how deep the security rabbit hole goes. &amp;nbsp; **References** *Ransomware*: Ransomware is any malicious program which is designed to block access to parts or whole of your files or computer system until a sum of money (ransom) is paid. *Phishing*: Phishing is an attempt to steal data/personal information/install malware on a computer by sending an email which looks to be coming from a trustworthy/known person or company. *2FA*: Two factor authentication where another item (that you have) is needed to authenticate yourself to a site apart from the password (that you know). *TOTP*: Time based One Time Password. In a normal OTP mechanism, the OTP is sent to you over a communication mechanism like email or SMS which have high chances of being intercepted. Instead of this, a TOTP is considered to be more secure as this is based on a pre-shared secret between you and the website and both can generate the same OTP to match without having to send it over an insecure communication channel. &amp;nbsp; **Recommended reading this week** This week's topic of discussion is ""password management"" in the light of the zomato hack. So what should you do to make sure about the eventuality that all sites can and will be hacked? Instead of harping on in a long article, I'll try to keep it simple and short. Your plan of action should take care of 2 scenarios: - Your password should not be recoverable (at least easily) from the hack - Party in your hand and partly in the companies' - Even if password is recovered, your damage should be limited to the current site only - Completely in your hand (along with some help from companies) The first can be taken care of by ensuring a good password hygiene. Shortest answer to this is use a long password (say 30-40 chars) made of random gibberish using different cases, letters, numbers special chars etc. Can be taken care of by using a password manager. A gotcha: Even if you used a complex passwords, many sites ask you to fill in ""security questions"" to recover password if you forget it. Avoid filling these in at all. If mandatory, treat them as password fields as well. The second can be ensured by making sure that you always use different passwords for different sites. This can be easily taken care of by using a password manager again. Apart from this, enable 2FA (two factor authentication) wherever it is supported by a website. Also, prefer to use a TOTP based 2FA (like Google authenticator or Authy) wherever possible instead of SMS based OTP. My Password Manager recommendations: - Keepass: Preferable. Available on all major PC and mobile OSs. Open source. Audited. Completely offline (no sync) by default and you can choose your own method. Semi-decent integration with browsers. - 1password: Available on most OSs but closed source. Well regarded and good integration with browsers. Paid. Cloud sync. Use as alternative if not confortable with Keepass. Further reading: [1](URL [2](URL [3](URL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -SecurityUnderflow "

Today afternoon my sister got an unknown call from some person claiming to be some sort of banker to do some reset or something of her card. (I wasn't home when this happened). He asked for her card number and the number from the back of the card( She didn't know about CVV). She gave him both the numbers and he also managed to get the OTP( she didn't know what this was too). He made a transaction of about 9k(about 1 month of her salary) and tried to get her Atm PIN(finally she knew what this was). She didn't give and cut the calls after that. I don't think he will be able to use more money cause he doesn't have her cell. Whatever little money was remaining I quickly used up just to be safe. I know this is next level nave but. Mom has been bedridden so don't know whether it is worth filing a case or going to cyber crime portal. She tried calling the bank to freeze her account but they asked her to come in person.(will try to do this in the evening) Any advice on what to do in this case or just accept the loss. I hope the scammer has not used the money for illegal stuff. TL;DR: Sister lost 9k being duped through phone call. U1: **Thanks for all the support guys.** Didn't want to say this cause she's my sister but she was least bothered about this the whole time except for the first hour or so. It's hard to see such an attitude from her. She feels, ah mistakes happen but she doesn't care, doesn't want to learn. It's sad. Just wanted to get this of my chest as I've been all tensed up. "

No SMS / emails of OTP were received prior to these four messages. * 12:38 PM - Payee A/c XXXXXXX added * 12:41 PM - Payee A/c XXXXXXX added * 12:42 PM - INR 1,00,000 debited * 12:47 PM - INR 35,000 debited These two beneficiaries were NOT added by mom or dad. Nobody knows these persons. These transactions were unauthorized. No account passwords, card details or any sort of information was divulged by anyone to any third person. They did not receive any calls/ emails or meet any person asking them to share details. My parents do not use the mobile banking app. This account is not even registered for it. My dad headed to ICICI Bank as soon as the first SMS of a payee added was received. As he entered the bank premises, another message that INR 1,00,000 have been debited from the account was received. He requested bank manager that a fraud transaction has happened and to please freeze the account or stop transactions. Unfortunately, the Bank manager outright said she couldnt help him although he had proof (Pass books,Original Passport which mentions mom as his spouse). Rather she directed him to call the customer care support and head to the police station. While having this conversation another fraud transaction of INR35,000 was made. This happened when he was in the branch with request to stop the transaction by any means. I understand that a bank cannot just stop transactions because someone said so. But they should have at least paid attention to the issue. Some sort of action. By this time, mom was on the phone but no response from the customer care. Meanwhile, we went and gave a complaint to the Cyber Crime Cell. I say gave because they did not file a formal complaint and told us that this is the issue of a bank and bank has to solve it. We went back to the bank with a handwritten and signed letter from mom saying that she gives dad the authority to handle this matter. I can, again, understand why this cannot be accepted by the bank. But the manner in which the bank manager and her assistant behaved was casual and rude. They kept insisting on getting my mom to register a formal complaint although they knew very well that my mother is not in the country. We were not offered any sort of guidance on how to proceed except the stock reply ""call the customer care"". And it should be noted that my mother was calling the ICICI call support to receive zero response. We got really fed up and went to the police station again. Where they said they cant do anything again. We told mom to head to the ICICI branch in her city. She spent more than half a day there but ZERO ACTION. Dad caught hold of ICICI CEO email and sent it straight to her. We got a reply from the office saying that they will respond by 29th March 2016. But as of today, 31 March 2016, no one has replied although i have sent them reminder mails. I will be updating this thread as the situation progresses. tldr: bank account got hacked, ICICI is investigating. [UPDATE] 01 April 2016: Sent emails to ICICI senior management(again!) and RBI ombudsman from the link provided by u/madrascalcutta (URL [UPDATE] 07 April 2016: icici management has asked us to wait for a month to complete the investigation.

Some one used my debit card on this store last night URL Steps taken so far: * 1) Reported issue to HDFC bank using thier online form and emailed my 'personal' banker (thier toll free number works only between 9-6 pm ist, transaction took place at 21:30 pm) * 2) cancelled debit card online * 3) changed online hdfc password * 4) logged into ebay and reported issue to this seller (their toll free number too does not work, just constant beeping sound) * 5) created an account in paypal and registered complaint to them (their toll free number too does not work) * 6) Visa does not have any online complaint email id, their toll free number does not work, so posted on their facebook page. It would be nice if all of these guys just had a single email id where issues can be reported, instead of me having to create accounts for each and everyone of them, to just report a single issue. my belief is that the bank should be the one to refund/return my money, however with so many entities involved, does anyone know how to go about getting my money back? tldr: debit card fraudulently used, suggestions for remediation welcome UPDATE: In case anyone re-visits this link, i finally got my money back, to do this i had to file a complaint at my cities cyber crime division, this was a simpler process then i thought, you just write down what happened with your card details on a piece of paper, the cyber crime guys make an entry in their register, stamp it and complaint done! This i submitted to HDFC bank with a card reversal form (if such a complaint is done, then the card is cancelled automatically and net access to the account is blocked). Anyway, i got the money back in 12 days which to me is a record. Reporting the issue to PayPal, Visa and Ebay paid no dividends, only PayPal got back they recorded my call and said they would email back and never id, Ebay got back once and then only silence from them. and so ends my saga!

47,cyber-crime,india,"What does the UN report on ""cyber-violence"" say about India?",2,3njue1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3njue1/what_does_the_un_report_on_cyberviolence_say/,2015-10-05 18:52:44,"Recently, the UN Women and the UN Broadband Commission presented a report called **[Cyber Violence Against Women And Girls: A World-Wide Wake-up Call](URL It essentially equated cyber-violence to [physical violence](URL and argued that something needs to done as a lot of women and girls are victims of it. It was criticised and mocked everywhere. The [UK Telegraph](URL published an article which said *""UN is now a joke organisation completely detached from its noble past aims""* and *""it has now adopted another issue which is completely irrelevant to millions of women across the globe""*. The [NY Magazine](URL said cyber-bullying was a serious problem, but criticised the report itself by calling it *""extremely slipshod, careless document that doesnt offer anything approaching a sophisticated understanding""*. What this got to do with you? Given the current government's stance towards censorship and ending anonymity on the internet, under the guise of protecting women and children, I think you should know what it says about India and what wordings were used. Below, I have analysed any mention of India, both the good and the bad. * The reports argues that cyber-crimes are not a [first-world problem](/r/firstworldproblems) using India's example. ""*Online crimes are not a first world problem; they seamlessly follow the spread of the Internet. The use of WhatsApp instant messaging, for example, has become, the latest harassment tool of choice in countries like India and Malaysia, and increasingly around the world.*"" * The reports mentions India's low penetration of internet and its fast growth. ""*Among the top 20 countries, India has the lowest penetration rate; a mere 19 per cent, but commands the highest yearly growth rate.*"" * Again Whatsapp was mentioned. ""*Some 500 million people use mobile devices and the WhatsApp mobile text messaging application. In India alone WhatsApp users reached 70 million per month.*"" * The report claims that most female victims of crime-bullying in India don't reported it. ""*A report from India, for instance, suggests that only 35 per cent of the women have reported about their victimization, 46.7 per cent have not reported and 18.3 per cent have been unaware of the fact that they have been victimized ... women prefer not to report about their victimization owing to social issues.*"" Here is the [survey](URL (Debarati Halder and K. Jaishankar, 2010) they quoted. The sample size of the survey was 60 women and 13 men. * A 2014 [BBC World and GlobeScan poll](URL was cited to claimed that in India 67% people feel safe to express their views online. 17 countries were survey, only in 6 countries the majority felt safe to express their views online. All 6 were developing countries, meaning this has nothing to do with cyber-bullying, more about state surveilance. The BBC article says so but the UN report twisted it. * Now, the report quotes former Chief Justice K. G. Balakrishnan, ""*The widespread circulation of such content is particularly harmful for women. The pervasive gender discrimination in our society is further heightened since the digital medium provides the convenient shield of anonymity and fake identities. Errant persons become more emboldened in their offensive behavior since it is presumed that they will not face any consequences.""* The quote is real, I checked it. It was part of [2010 National Seminar on the Enforcement of Cyber Law](URL Among other things, he had criticised internet anonymity in that speech. * The UN report mentions a presentation on [""Using social media for the prevention of violence against women: Lessons learned from social media communication campaigns to prevent violence against women in India, China and Viet Nam""](URL by the group called ""Partners for Prevention"", which had used social media to promote awareness about violence against women in India, China and Vietnam. * The UN report mentions some groups and projects from India: [Lets Talk Men 2.0](URL a documentary series from the sub-continent; and [Centre for Cyber Victim Counselling](URL an Indian NGO started in 2009 to counsel victims of cyber crime, they published the 60 women survey above. * It mentions that one college-educated and working woman in India wants women-only cyber cafes. *""More women-friendly content would drive women online according to Egyptian high-income women who did not use the Internet but called for new websites only for women or dedicated to women, or women-only chatting. Somewhat in the same vein, a high-income, university educated Indian professional who does use the Internet wanted cybercafs that are open only to women.""* The reference is a Intel, Dalberg and GlobalScan study called ""[Women and the Web](URL The study quotes one Gayatri Buragohain, who founded the Feminist Approach To Technology, saying that there should women-only cafes similar to women-only rural bank branches, ""*Stakeholders could do something similar with Internet cafes in rural areas: train women to operate and manage them, and let them make a profit.*"" * It blames Whatsapp for not monitoring the messages instead relies on a reporting system and says that in India harassers take advantage of the policy, as most people in India don't know how to report. *""WhatsApp excuses itself from monitoring of contents or messages by putting the burden of safe practices on the users and directing the victims to report the matters through takedown reports or self-protection mechanisms. Harassers or perpetrators take huge advantage of this situation since the level of awareness regarding safe practices in the WhatsApp is low in countries like India.""* * The report mentions the *Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act 1986* under which porn and erotica is banned in India, but not online. (Note: There are also laws banning erotica. But, this is the main one.) *""Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act 1986 (IRWA), is currently under consideration for amendment by Parliament to include virtual spaces. Indian laws regarding data privacy, offensive communication through Internet and digital communication technology and jurisdictional issues in cases of crimes committed through ICT and DCT still need to be developed.""* The report makes it seem like a good thing. The report makes no mention of the IT Act, which criminalises revenge porn, child porn and until recently ""offensive messages"". (Remember Section 66A?). * The mentions the ""[Feminist Principles of the Internet](URL and claims that the Indian government, among others, is adopting parts of it. **Disclaimer:** I have not linked to any social networking site, personal blog, or revealed any personal information.

Here's mine. TLDR; some guy cheated me on ebay, so I beat the shit out of him. This whole thing happened approx 1.5 years ago. I had put up my laptop for sale on ebay. It's cost was some 1.7L and I had put it up for 1.5L. It was almost new, a month old. Due to some problems in family and need of money, I had put it up for sale. So it was at nice price and I was getting some good feedback. I am from Mumbai and a buyer from Bangalore bought it. I promptly shipped it with well packaging and he received it after 3 days. Next 3 days he was quiet and then he raised an Ebay Guarantee Claim against me and claimed me that I have sent a faulty laptop. I was new to ebay as a seller. (as a buyer I have 200+ feedback.) and this was my first sale. Ebay asked me to solve the issue with him. Since it was well within under warranty, I asked him to contact dell and see what they say. And he denied it saying he has no time and neither he was expecting a faulty laptop. After couple of email exchanges I had to give up. So I agreed to take it back provided he bears return shipping costs. he sent me back in same packaging. Except that, it didn't come with my laptop and some broken laptop. I was shocked and I called ebay asap. They took about 2 hours to get on line. Well the rep said send us pics etc. Which I did. Buyer claimed he did send my laptop back and there was no mistake from his side. He also shared the courier bill which displayed the weight and volume of package, which exactly matched mine. Thats when I realized I was cheated and this was rather much elaborative plan from the buyer. I was so down at that moment, I locked myself in a room and cried. Because I knew I am never gonna receive any money from the buyer. or ebay. Next few days went on exchanging emails. I begged the buyer, begged ebay. But none of them listened. Someone suggested me to contact ebay.com and higher ups. Tweet in social media, but everything was ignored. I started spending time on ebay community forums and this kind of cheating was common to everyone. poeple would just send back empty box, or broken mobiles, or taking HDD etc parts from the laptop etc. It was horrifying to read. After 10 days (I think), the dispute was ended and ebay sided with buyer and refunded his money back. He had some 50+ positive buyer feedback and I had zero seller feedback. I thought ebay also has seller protection, looks like I was wrong. He also left me a -ve feedback for all this. Next, after suggestion of my friends, I filed a case at Cyber Crime Mumbai. Long story, short, nothing good came out of it after a month. So I had to let go of it anyway. I badly needed money and I had to take loan from a friend. Thanks to the buyer, he almost cost life of someone dear to me. Later, I called the buyer, when all ended. He was laughing in phone and told me he made a 'chutiya' to me. He was proud about that. He said he had done many times and he will do many times to make profits. Too bad I didn't record that call. I almost fell into a depression for this. 1.5L was not a small sum for me. It almost broke me inside. I started drinking more and wasting money. I was becoming a different person. Getting snarky all the time, shouting, getting angry easily etc. That stage of my life was real bad. After 6 months, I went to Bangalore on official work. And I stayed at my old friend's place. And I shared him entire story. And after couple of pegs, we decided that we gotta teach the buyer a lesson. His home was some 15-16Km away from where we stayed. I had his address, but did not know how he looked etc. So we went near to his home, stayed at a nearby playground/park and started observing movements. An hour later a guy came out. I guessed he could be the one. So I called him from my phone he picked it up. I disconnected. Did one more time and spoke with him. I knew his name. So I asked for 'hey, are you XYZ'? He said yes. Then I asked about 'how are you, how is your new job etc', this was to show I had called to a wrong number, but with similar name. Obviously he denied and then I asked 'are you ABC not_his_surname', he denied and said, 'no, I am XYZ real_surname'. So thats how I confirmed the guy. Knew what bike he rides etc. I went back to mumbai after my office work was finished. I had made him a call, which was dubious so it wasn't right time to do anything. A month later I came back to Bangalore again on official work. And me and my friend again tracked him. one late evening, somewhere around 9pm, we caught him near the playground. It was dark and there were no people at all. We both were wearing helmets and stopped him asking for an address. While my friend was asking for address, I hit him hard and he fell off the bike. Before he could realise what was happening, I dragged him to a corner in the park and started hitting. My friend parked both of our bikes and joined me. Then I beat the shit out of him. I was very angry for what he had done. we had brought a cricket bat and I hit his legs till the bat broke. Then I found an iron rod near, and I started beating with that. My friend knew this was getting serious, so he started asking me to stop. I never listened. And that buyer had gone unconscious already. I broke his right leg, beyond repair with the rod. I am sure it almost got separated. And neither I spared the left leg. I knew I had made him a cripple. Then I took a large stone and threw on his right leg. That was it. I took all his belongings, so that it looks like an attempted robbery. We ran away. We ran like anything on our bike. next morning I went to my office as if nothing had happened and after finishing work I went back to Mumbai. So, am I proud for what I have done? No, certainly not. And to think of it i regret a lot for what I have done. He is a serial cheater and there are many such people. And still I didn't feel it's right, what I did. Still today it haunts me. In my whole life I never had beat up anyone and that incident scares me. The evil inside me had come out. I checked his facebook sometime later after months. I confirmed it that he had permanently had become a cripple. I cried that day. People like him ruin lives of many people. Go to ebay forums, you will see so many people pulling similar stunt what he had done. So many sellers are in loss of lakhs of rupees. And I still feel bad for what I had done, even though I weeded out a bad apple. And neither there's no way to confirm he stopped doing that. "
50,cyber-crime,india,Here is a good article from Digit.in which have arguments for and against net neutrality and also uses a pictograph taken (stolen?) from /r/india,1,31rb7z,http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/31rb7z/here_is_a_good_article_from_digitin_which_have/,2015-04-08 01:39:38,"[Here is the full Digit.in article](URL [Here is one of the pictograph they used, which I believe is stolen from /r/india](URL **Highlights from the article** ***Why net neutrality is being defended:*** 1. Without net neutrality, it would be very easy for ISPs to mould the browsing habits of its users with the help of pricing slabs, different speeds for different sites and other methods. So, if Airtel wanted its users to visit Flipkart, it would make it exceedingly easy and advantageous to do so and put competing sites on the back foot which would clearly be an anti-competition move. 2. Net neutrality also ensures that small, new companies can compete against established big names on the Internet fairly. If net neutrality did not exist then big companies would shackle their competition with the implicit ability to be able pay more to the ISPs to ensure better service, something that most start-ups wouldnt be able to do. 3. Now, this scenario may lie at the furthest end of the slippery slope, but here it is: since the absence of net neutrality could mean that an ISP will get money from companies, that relationship may be enough to compel the ISP to mute online criticism against one of its paying partners. 4. Another scenario that exists without net neutrality is that the Internet becomes a stratified mess and youll be forced to choose packages of websites and services like you do with your DTH subscription. If you want unrestricted access to the Internet, the ISPs could force you to pay through the nose. 5. The anti-net neutrality arguments become even more vociferous when it comes to VoIP and messaging apps like WhatsApp and Viber. Since these services directly affect the telcos bottomline, there is the significant possibility that the companies behind these apps will have to register for licenses in order to conduct operations in India. This means that unless the companies behind messaging and VoIP apps decide to pay the government for licenses, you wont be able to use them. ***Points put forward against net neutrality:*** 1. ISPs argue that they can increase the overall efficiency of their networks if theyre allowed to actively manage them. This means that ISPs can decide how to shape Internet traffic so that heavy Internet users dont affect the experience of light users. ISPs also claim that this will allow them to give preference to certain types of online services that are necessary and should be prioritized, such as communication channels used by hospitals or emergency response services during a disaster. 2. ISPs also argue that adopting a blanket net neutrality policy will give rise to security risks and increase piracy and cyber crime. ISPs claim that the only way they can help the government to police the Internet better is if they can manage it. 3. One of the more ideological arguments against net neutrality is that it will give too much power to the government organisation that will be responsible for enforcing net neutrality. Some net neutrality detractors have argued that its better for user privacy and competition if the ISPs themselves manage the Internet rather than letting a governmental body have control."
51,cyber-crime,india,Refuting TRAI's Anti-Net Neutrality Arguments,8,33lfnj,http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/33lfnj/refuting_trais_antinet_neutrality_arguments/,2015-04-24 00:04:21,"First of all thank you everyone here for bringing the net neutrality debate to public attention. Following are the refutations to arguments against Net Neutrality and OTT's I send to trai, (though I don't think anyone is going to read this, considering the massive email protest they are getting) **1. Revenue loss for telecom providers, loss for traditional tv services.** That is the very nature of a competitive market. New innovations disrupts existing products and services. Ultimately it is the choice of the consumers to use what. It will be disastrous in the long run to save a failing industry due to better alternatives, by savaging that alternative. It is simply taking away the choice of consumers and sabotaging innovation. What if telephone and mobiles where sabotaged to create more revenues for postal services. What if the automotive industry where sabotaged to save the horse and bullock cart trading, where the world would have been today? **2. OTT's are free riding on ISP's infrastructure, which requires investments.** It could also be said that, it is because of these websites and applications that people are subscribing to the internet. Not for the sheer pleasure of being an internet owner. OTT's does require capital investments and unlike the isp's most of the websites and applications do not charge money directly from the users, they are supported by advertisements. Since the OTT's are creating greater demand for the internet and ISP's are directly benefiting from it, does the ISPs should also pay these websites a part of their revenue? If you see it as preposterous then the notion that OTTs' should also pay ISP's are also equally preposterous. Second, the argument is that OTTs are free riding on their infrastructure, therefore the consumers should pay according to the websites they use. ISP's are in the business of providing internet and charges the users based on the speed and data they have consumed. Just like electricity providers are in the business of providing electricity and they charge per unit consumed. What if electricity providers suddenly decided to charge based on the brand of appliances you use instead of the units consumed. How ridiculous that would be? Third, the argument is that OTT's cause revenue loss and ISP's require capital investments. As said earlier, unlike OTT's, ISP's are directly charging consumers for the services they are providing. People who wants higher speeds and higher data usages are paying accordingly. Now the notion is that consumers and OTT's should chip in even more for their bottom line. What if energy companies suddenly comes with a similar demand. The automobiles are literally riding on the fuel the energy companies provide, and these energy companies too require substantial capital investments. Consider a scenario where energy companies demand for revenue share from automobile companies and consumers are charged for the fuel they use based on the brand, type and color of the car they are riding instead of in liters. **3. TSP's has a lot of barrier to entry and OTT's not.** How is low barrier to entry supposed to be a bad thing? Anyone anywhere in the world, with an access to internet can now create and promote his or her product and services, thereby solving a consumers problem and creating more employment, in what way a bad thing? This low barrier to entry and scalability has revolutionized the digital world and why you need to spoil it? Unless of course you are on the wrong side. **4. OTT's only benefits the countries they are located in.** Leading websites and applications hire a lot of employees world wide not necessarily from the location it operates. They also outsource their jobs to different parts of the world benefiting everyone, not only the country they are located in. Second, the internet also presents great opportunity for Indians to create their own products &amp; services and the emergence of many successful start-ups are the evidence. Third, due to the cost cutting achieved by local businesses due to otts, they are also benefiting greatly. Now they can pass on this gains to consumers or re- invest their profits creating more employment. Fourth, the increase in purchasing power of consumers. The availability of free websites and apps have increased the purchasing power of consumers which they can spend locally or save or invest which in turns provide more jobs. **5. Blocking or throttling speed will benefit local app service providers.** Indians are not inferior! Indian entrepreneurs and start-ups does have the passion, knowledge and resources to compete on a global stage. They don't need the government, regulators or isp's blocking and throttling the competitors products or services. They are capable of competing on an open free market. **6. Revenue losses for TSP's will lower government revenues.** Again this is a very short sighted view. One, the cost cutting advantages of existing businesses due to the ott's increases their profits thereby adding more revenue to the government. Second the increase in purchasing power of consumers. For example, someone who used to spent Rs.100 on internet and Rs.200 a month on sms package, due to the emergence of free sms apps, now have Rs.200 to spent on other local products or services, which in turn leads to revenue for the government. **7. Communication OTTs can entirely unintentionally cause disturbance and affect the social fabric. There is also the possibility of deliberate misuse of communication OTTs, to sow disharmony and discord.** That argument can be used against any communication devices. Even for pen and paper, or against teaching people how to read and write. Of the fear of misuse by a small section of people, if we have stopped educating the youths in the past, think where the world would have been today. **8.Most applications can trace the users location for underlying processes (such as GPS apps finding the nearest restaurants etc.). This information may be used to commit a crime, or the location itself may be the target of a crime.** Such crimes were committed long before gps. Don't you think criminals have many other more effective alternatives to get to a location they want. Does we also need to ban maps? Now look at the immense uses the gps provide, like routing to the nearby hospitals in case of emergency and the role it can provide to other emergency services, on top of making our travel much easier and safer. **9. Causes cyber bullying and other attacks.** This is a serious issue, and fortunately there exists laws to punish such crimes. Personally if someone wants to bully or attack me, I'll any day choose the digital option than a real physical attack. **10. According to some experts, if Net Neutrality is imposed, due to rise in data traffic, TSPs will be forced to increase the cost of access for consumers and consumers would be worse off.** Reading through the horrendous plans that is to be implemented in the absence of net neutrality, It'll be better to live in a country where the internet costs are higher, than in a dictatorship. And finally to all the 20 questions asked. Internet, as of now, works! And If it ain't broke don't fix it. "
