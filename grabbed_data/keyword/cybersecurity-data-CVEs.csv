0,CVEs,cybersecurity,Debian CVE false positives,1,hc5hdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/hc5hdo/debian_cve_false_positives/,2020-06-20 04:00:45,"Hello r/cybersecurity, I thought this would be a good place to ask this question: I'm currently looking into (docker) container image scanning. I've tried some scanners, like clair and trivy, which I like a lot so far. It so happens that both find a lot of vulnerabilities in the debian:latest docker image (80, 1 of them critical). An image based on debian I tested had way more even when running a apt-get upgrade. I suggested using alpine as base image because of the smaller attack surface in general, but a colleague mentioned that with debian there's usually a lot of false positives as versions wouldn't always reflect already patched software. According to URL there's only 1 non-kernel package with unfixed CVEs and low urgency for debian stable. Now the question(s): In what way is that true or could even be possible? Is there something I don't regard in terms of how the scanner works that would produce (so many) false positives? Are clair or trivy just not suitable for debian based images? Do you have any general advice regarding this issue? (I'm aware, and my current strategy would be: making updates easy and deploy them often; employ a scanner; decrease attack surface where possible)"

What should I be ""advertising"" for companies to even interview me? I have had personal experience with linux/windows and a few penetration testing tools using both kali linux and parrot os security edition. I have been studying for Sec + just cause it seems what everyone is doing. My GPA is not the best, I switched from something that I did not like. I've participated and 3 conferences, 3-4 CTFs, and I have been trying some of the challenges on HackTheBox.eu, and learning from TryHackMe.com I have not been very successful with hackthebox as I can't seem to connect 1 and 1 to make 2 and reach to the conclusion of how to exploit an actual machine. I account that to my lack of knowledge in misconfigurations. I have successfully exploited 2 easy boxes in the past using CVEs or just enumerating AD. I've only been learning for the past year and a half, but it feels that I am slowing down. I would like to know if doing tryhackme and hackthebox are profitable in the sense of learning/time efficient. I would also like to know what is being sought after by companies for pentesters. I believe I have drive and ambitions of becoming better but I'm doubtful that I am going about it the correct or time efficient way. Any constructive criticisms/comments are welcome. Also, thank for taking the time to read/respond TL:DR Require advice about whether me learning through hackthebox, tryhackme is time efficient and how to get my foot in the door in currently whatever job possible that has to do with technology and preferably security"
