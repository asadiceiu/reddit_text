The company admits it should be using the 11-06 patch label but says it &amp;quot;Wasn&amp;#039;t worth delaying the roll-out to fix the patch date.&amp;quot; Samsung should have a KRACK fix out this month, too: it posted a November Security Maintenance Release bulletin that contains all the KRACK CVEs. &gt; This month, users will get a monthly security patch, but it might be dated November 5 and not have the KRACK fix. ***** [**Summary Source**](URL | [FAQ](URL ""240996 summaries so far."") | [Feedback](URL ""PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome."") | *Top* *keywords*: **security**^#1 **patch**^#2 **Google**^#3 **KRACK**^#4 **Android**^#5 Post found in [/r/Android](URL [/r/GooglePixel](URL [/r/essential](URL [/r/technology](URL [/r/droidsec](URL [/r/pancakepalpatine](URL [/r/TheColorIsOrange](URL and [/r/SkydTech](URL *NOTICE*: This thread is for discussing the submission topic.
